The purpose of this study was to evaluate oral clonidine in a dose of 0.3 mg as a routine premedicant. Sixty-nine normotensive female patients were studied in a randomized double-blind investigation in which clonidine was compared with an inert treatment. Clonidine produced a significant reduction in anxiety (P less than 0.05) and sedation and a reduction in the sleep dose of methohexitone (P less than 0.05). Tachycardia in response to intubation was attenuated by clonidine (P less than 0.05). However, the magnitude of the increase in arterial pressure after intubation was not affected. Intraoperative and postoperative hypotension were common after premedication with clonidine 0.3 mg and caution is urged in its use as a premedicant.
A 55-year-old Caucasian man who had received a second kidney graft in July 1993, was switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus in June 2000 due to deterioration of renal function. Thereafter, he began to complain of muscle cramps in both quadriceps with an increased CPK and EMG findings of polyneuropathy. A muscle biopsy demonstrated acute myositis. Prednisone was administered with amelioration of the patient's symptoms, but with persistently increased CPK and myoglobin levels. In February 2001, mycophenolate mofetil was introduced and tacrolimus tapered to 3 mg daily to seek a toxic role of this immunosuppressant, since there was no other cause of myositis. A sudden decrease in CPK was observed, but the complete normalization took place only after its withdrawal in September 2002. This case represents a tacrolimus-associated myositis.
Agonists for the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the rexinoids, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), the thiazolidinediones, are effective in the treatment of insulin resistance in rodent models by enhancing insulin action and improving glycemic control. In the present study, we compared the effects of rexinoids and a thiazolidinedione on body weight and mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) isoform mRNA expression in the obese Zucker fa/fa rat. Long-term (2 weeks) oral treatment with the rexinoids LG100268 and LG100324 reduced food intake and body weight gain, whereas rosiglitazone (BRL49653) tended to increase both food intake and weight gain. LG100268 and LG100324 increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) UCP-1 mRNA content by 2.7-fold (P < .002) and 3.1-fold (P < .001), respectively, while BRL49653 had no effect on BAT UCP-1 mRNA content. Neither the rexinoids nor the thiazolidinedione had any effect on the level of mRNA encoding UCP-2 and the recently described PPARgamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1). LG100324 increased UCP-3 mRNA content by 3.6-fold (P < .0005) in muscle and 4.3-fold (P < .0002) in white adipose tissue (WAT). LG100268 increased UCP-3 mRNA content in WAT by 2-fold (P < .005) but was without any effect on muscle UCP-3. BRL49653 increased UCP-3 mRNA content by 2.1-fold (P < .005) in muscle and 2.7-fold (P < .003) in WAT. Thus, the rexinoids, but not the thiazolidinedione, have an antiobesity action by reducing food intake, and the increase in UCP-1 mRNA content in BAT may reflect a stimulation of BAT UCP-1 activity.
Tooth agenesis and clef palate are associated to the mutation of the Msx1 homeobox genes, highlighting the pivotal role of homeobox genes during the initial development of the craniofacial skeleton. Msx1 also controls the terminal differentiation of mineralised tissues forming cells. Recently, a Msx1 antisense RNA has been identified which inhibits Msx1 protein expression in odontoblastic cells. In order to investigate the role of Msx1 gene and its antisense RNAs during the late developmental stages of the craniofacial bone formation, the expression pattern of Msx1 protein, sense and antisense transcripts and the aspects of bone growth have been studied in post-natal normal and Msx1 knock-in mutant mice. Msx1 protein was strongly expressed in preosteoblasts of specific bone sites such as the basal mandible. At the same bone sites, bone growth was impaired or markedly decreased in knock-in mice. The comparison between the various expression patterns of Msx1 protein, sense and antisense RNAs suggests that the site-specific action of Msx1 protein on bone growth and craniofacial morphogenesis and that Msx1 protein level could be controlled by the local ratio of Msx1 sense and antisense RNAs. Regarding our experimental data and hypothesis, a clinical study of patients with MSX1 mutation will be performed in order to better characterize the abnormalities of the craniofacial skeleton growth.
Tramadol is a novel analgesic possessing both opiate and noradrenergic effects. Its low potential for abuse suggests increasing use, but there are limited data on the toxicity in overdose.
Multicenter prospective case series. All exposures from October 1995 through August 1996 reported to seven Poison Centers were evaluated.
There were 126 cases of which 87 were tramadol alone. Of the tramadol alone cases, 51 were female (59%). Age ranged from 1 to 86 y with a mean and median of 26.8 y (SD 17.2) and 25 y, respectively. There were 15 cases of children less than 6 years old. Symptoms reported with overdose were: lethargy 26 (30%), nausea 12 (14%), tachycardia 11 (13%), agitation 9 (10%), seizures 7 (8%), 4 each (5%) of coma and hypertension, and respiratory depression 2 (2%). All seizures were brief. Naloxone reversed sedation and apnea in 4 of 8 patients. One patient experienced a seizure immediately after administration of naloxone. Other treatments were: diazepam (3 patients), and phenytoin, lorazepam and nifedipine (1 patient each). Tramadol 500 mg was the lowest dose associated with seizure, tachycardia, hypertension or agitation while 800 mg was the lowest dose associated with coma and respiratory depression. Urine drug screens performed on 19 patients were negative for opiates. All symptomatic cases exhibited effects within 4 h of ingestion. Mean hospital stay was 15.2 h (range 2-96 h, SD 15.8). Nineteen patients were admitted to an intensive care unit with a mean stay of 25 h (SD 20).
Much of the toxicity in tramadol overdose appears to be attributable to the monoamine uptake inhibition rather than its opioid effects. Agitation, tachycardia, confusion and hypertension suggest a possible mild serotonin syndrome. No arrhythmias beyond tachycardia were seen.
This study suggests significant neurologic toxicity from tramadol overdose. Serious cardiovascular toxicity was not seen.
Anemia is a frequent and potentially serious toxicity associated with the use of carboplatin, particularly when this agent is administered in the salvage setting. In an effort to evaluate a possible role for human erythropoietin (rh-E) in preventing or minimizing carboplatin-induced anemia we analyzed the impact of the agent on anemia and transfusion requirements of women with ovarian cancer who were treated on one of two nonrandomized trials employing identical second-line carboplatin-based intraperitoneal regimens, with the only difference in the regimens being the addition of rh-E (Study 1, without rh-E; Study 2, with rh-E). There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of documented nadir hemoglobin levels of < 9 g/dl (Study 1, 60%; Study 2, 13%; P < 0.005) and < 8 g/dl (Study 1, 33%; Study 3, 6%; P < 0.05). We also observed a threefold reduction in transfusion requirements with the use of rh-E (Study 1, 23%; Study 2, 6%), but this difference was not statistically significant with the limited sample size evaluated. In this nonrandomized comparison of two identical chemotherapy programs we have demonstrated that rh-E significantly reduced the incidence and severity of anemia associated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy. A randomized trial examining the potential impact of rh-E on carboplatin-induced anemia and transfusion requirements is warranted.
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin are affected by polymorphisms in the genes coding for cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1).
The objective of this study was to develop a pharmacogenetic dosing algorithm for warfarin in Korean patients with atrial fibrillation and to compare it with the published pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms for accuracy to predict warfarin maintenance dose.
Clinical and genetic data from 130 Korean patients with atrial fibrillation (mean [SD] age: 66.2 [13.3] years; gender, male/female: 86/44; mean body weight: 66.6 [11.6] kg) were used to create a dosing algorithm, which was validated against an independent group of patients (n = 108; mean age: 67.4 [10.1] years; gender, male/female: 69/39; mean body weight: 66.0 [10.9] kg). Validation cohort data for the 12 previously published dosing algorithms incorporating CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype information were also applied.
A multivariate regression model including the variables of age, VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotype, body surface area, and statin status produced the best model for estimating the warfarin dose (R(2) = 0.62). Among the 12 algorithms that were compared, the predicted doses using algorithms derived from both the Swedish Warfarin Genetics (WARG) study and the Korean population study showed the best correlation with actual warfarin doses. Comparing the percentage of patients whose predicted dosages were within 20% of actual dosages, these algorithms showed similar overall performance.
This study derived and validated a multivariate regression model for daily warfarin dose requirements in Korean patients with atrial fibrillation. As no algorithm could be considered the best for all dosing ranges, it may be important to consider the characteristics or limitations of each dosing algorithm and the nature of a population in choosing the most appropriate pharmacogenetic dosing.
To increase awareness of minocycline-induced autoimmune syndromes.
Review of relevant publications from the American and European literature.
Four minocycline-induced syndromes have been described in 82 patients: serum sickness, drug-induced lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, and vasculitis. Aside from sporadic cases of serum sickness, all other syndromes occurred in patients treated for acne. Drug-induced lupus and hepatitis were by far the most common events (66 cases). Except for serum sickness, which presented shortly (mean, 16 days) after minocycline, the autoimmune syndromes manifested after protracted use (mean, 25.3 months). As expected, the patients with acne were young (mean, 19.7 years). The most frequent symptoms were arthralgia, followed by arthritis, fever, and rash (73, 45, 38, and 29 patients, respectively). Serologically, antinuclear antibodies were the most common finding (63 positive of 68 tests); perinuclear anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA), when assayed, were similarly frequent (20 of 24 tests). Surprisingly, anti-histone antibodies were uncommon, even among patients with drug-induced lupus (4 of 31 tests). The clinical and serological features of the separate syndromes may overlap. The diagnostic value of pANCA, as well as its possible role in minocycline-induced autoimmunity, are discussed.
Minocycline has the potential to evoke a variety of clinical and serological autoimmune expressions. The number of published reports may underestimate the frequency of this condition, which should be suspected and investigated in young patients with autoimmune manifestations.
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression determines the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of many drugs in the body. Also, up-regulation of P-gp acts as a defense mechanism against acute inflammation. This study examined expression levels of abcb1 mRNA and localization of P-gp protein in the liver, kidney, duodenum, jejunum and ileum in healthy and E. coli infected broilers by real time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Meanwhile, pharmacokinetics of orally administered enrofloxacin was also investigated in healthy and infected broilers by HPLC. The results indicated that E. coli infection up-regulated expression of abcb1 mRNA levels significantly in the kidney, jejunum and ileum (P<0.05), but not significantly in the liver and duodenum (P>0.05). However, the expression level of CYP 3A37 mRNA were observed significantly decreased only in liver and kidney of E. coli infected broilers (P<0.05) compared with healthy birds. Furthermore, the infection reduced absorption of orally administered enrofloxacin, significantly decreased Cmax (0.34 vs 0.98 µg mL(-1), P = 0.000) and AUC0-12h (4.37 vs 8.88 µg mL(-1) h, P = 0.042) of enrofloxacin, but increased Tmax (8.32 vs 3.28 h, P = 0.040), T1/2a(2.66 vs 1.64 h(-1), P = 0.050) and V/F (26.7 vs 5.2 L, P = 0.040). Treatment with verapamil, an inhibitor of P-gp, significantly improved the absorption of enrofloxacin in both healthy and infected broilers. The results suggest that the E. coli infection induces intestine P-gp expression, altering the absorption of orally administered enrofloxacin in broilers.
Peroxisome proliferators activate nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and enhance the transcription of several genes in liver. We report here that synthetic PPARalpha ligands Wy-14,643, ciprofibrate, clofibrate, and others induce the nuclear translocation of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in mouse liver cells in vivo. Adenoviral-enhanced green fluorescent protein-CAR expression demonstrated that PPARalpha synthetic ligands drive CAR into the hepatocyte nucleus in a PPARalpha- and PPARbeta-independent manner. This translocation is dependent on the transcription coactivator PPAR-binding protein but independent of coactivators PRIP and SRC-1. PPARalpha ligand-induced nuclear translocation of CAR is not associated with induction of Cyp2b10 mRNA in mouse liver. PPARalpha ligands interfered with coactivator recruitment to the CAR ligand binding domain and reduced the constitutive transactivation of CAR. Both Wy-14,643 and ciprofibrate occupied the ligand binding pocket of CAR and adapted a binding mode similar to that of the CAR inverse agonist androstenol. These observations, therefore, provide information for the first time to indicate that PPARalpha ligands not only serve as PPARalpha agonists but possibly act as CAR antagonists.
Levetiracetam (LEV), a novel antiepileptic drug, has demonstrated antidyskinetic effect in preclinical animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and in one open label study in PD patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The acute antidyskinetic effects of LEV in patients with tardive dyskinesia were evaluated in an open label study. Eight patients received oral LEV (1,000 mg/day) for 1 month and blinded evaluations were performed at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. A significant reduction of the abnormal movements was recorded while psychiatric symptoms did not worsen and the adverse event profile was benign. LEV may be efficacious for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia and deserves further clinical testing.
The Testicular Cancer Intergroup Study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage II and salvage therapy in Stage I nonseminomatous testicular carcinoma. Chemotherapy regimens of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB) or the same drugs plus cyclophosphamide and dactinomycin (VAB) were used at institution or cooperative group preference. A comparison of the toxicities of these two regimens shows that VAB caused significantly more mucosal, dermatologic, and otologic toxicity than PVB, and PVB caused more leucopenia. Both regimens were equally effective in controlling cancer. Either regimen could be used as chemotherapy in testicular cancer, and the decision about which one to use could be based on their differences in toxicity and degree of patient convenience.
Vancomycin hydrochloride (2 g daily) was administered to 12 patients with cirrhosis and lactulose resistant portal systemic encephalopathy in a double blind crossover trial. All 12 patients showed a remarkable clinical improvement after vancomycin treatment. The mean (SE) electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency changed from 6.3 (0.2) to 8.5 (0.2) cps (p less than 0.001) and the mean arterial ammonia concentration from 152 (4) micrograms/ml to 97 (8) micrograms/ml (p less than 0.001). Their clinical condition deteriorated when treatment was switched to lactulose, returning to the previous slower EEG frequency and high arterial ammonia concentrations. Vancomycin seems to be effective in chronic portal systemic encephalopathy in patients who are not helped by lactulose alone.
The involvement of the excitatory neurotransmitter system in the lateral habenula and pedunculopontine nucleus in the initiation and propagation of limbic seizures induced by pilocarpine has been investigated in the rat. Limbic seizures occur in animals following bilateral microinjection into the lateral habenula of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (5 and 12.5 nmol) or kainate (100 and 200 pmol), 15 min prior to a subconvulsant dose of pilocarpine (150 mg/kg, i.p.). In the absence of pilocarpine NMDA (5 and 12.5 nmol) or kainate (100 and 200 pmol), injected focally into the lateral habenula or pedunculopontine nucleus, produced sniffing, grooming and tremor but no electrographic or behavioural seizures. Limbic seizures also occur after a subconvulsant dose of pilocarpine when it is preceded by injection of NMDA (5 and 12.5 nmol) or kainate (50, 100 and 200 pmol) into the pedunculopontine nucleus. Behavioural and electrographic signs of limbic seizures following pilocarpine (380 mg/kg, i.p.) were attenuated or completely antagonized by focal injection into the lateral habenula of the NMDA antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (AP7) (10 and 50 pmol) or kainate antagonist, gamma-D-glutamylaminomethylsulphonate (GAMS) (20 nmol). In addition, AP7 (0.05, 0.1 and 1.0 nmol) or GAMS (40 nmol) injected into the pedunculopontine nucleus suppressed limbic seizures induced by i.p. administration of pilocarpine (380 mg/kg). The relative efficacy of NMDA and non-NMDA receptor antagonists revealed that the selective NMDA antagonist, AP7, was more potent in its anticonvulsant activity in comparison to GAMS, a non-NMDA receptor antagonist.
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) and acromegaly are two hypersecretory states in which colorectal neoplasia has been described, but the incidence in the former condition may not be increased. We describe four patients with colorectal neoplasia associated with the ZES and review other published cases. Tissue ELISA with Adnab-9 antibody, a putative colorectal cancer risk marker, from a patient with ZES and from seven patients with acromegaly was compared to 13 controls at average risk for colorectal neoplasia. The patient with ZES without detectable colonic neoplasia and seven patients with acromegaly had increased binding of Adnab-9 in the colonic mucosa by ELISA. The difference was significant for the acromegaly patients compared to the controls (p < 0.05). The accumulated 34 instances of colorectal neoplasia in ZES patients suggests that this association may not be rare. Adnab-9 expression, detectable in both ZES and acromegaly, may reflect predisposition to colorectal neoplasia in both hyper-secretory states. Therefore, while a basis for association of colorectal neoplasia and hypergastrinemia exists, the clinical data are not compelling enough to warrant surveillance of patients with ZES. To resolve this problem, more definitive case control studies should be conducted.
To compare rates of recurrent preterm birth between women starting treatment with 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) at 16-20.9 weeks of gestation versus 21-26.9 weeks.
Women enrolled in an outpatient program of education, nursing assessment and weekly 17P injections beginning at 16-26.9 weeks were eligible. Included were patients with singleton pregnancies and a history of preterm delivery (PTD). Pregnancy outcome was compared between women starting 17P at 16-20.9 weeks (n=156) and those starting 17P at 21-26.9 weeks (n=119) using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test statistics (p<0.05 considered significant).
Mean gestational age at delivery (36.8 +/- 3.0 vs. 36.7 +/- 2.5) and rates of PTD at <37 weeks (40.4% vs. 48.7%), <35 weeks (16.7% vs. 16.8%) and <32 weeks (5.1% vs. 5.0%) were similar between the groups; all p > 0.05.
Rates of preterm delivery were similar in patients initiating 17P at 16-20.9 or 21-26.9 weeks. A larger sample size is warranted in order to confirm our findings.
The high incidence of cardiac malformations in humans and animal models with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is well known. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac maldevelopment in CDH are still unclear. It has been reported that GATA4 and GATA6, members of the GATA transcription factor family, act cooperatively to regulate cardiovascular development, and the levels of cardiac GATA4 and GATA6 are important regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, cardiac morphogenesis, and embryo survival. In addition, the GATA4/GATA6 double heterozygous mutant embryo model displayed a spectrum of cardiovascular malformations similar to those seen in human CDH and nitrofen-induced animal models, including ventricular and aortopulmonary septal defects and thin ventricular myocardium. To test the hypothesis that expression of GATA4 and GATA6 is reduced in early stages of gestation in a CDH hypoplastic heart, we investigated the expression of GATA4 and GATA6 in the hearts of nitrofen-treated rats in early gestation. Wnt2, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) were also investigated as GATA4/6 target genes involved in cardiogenesis.
Fetal rat hearts of normal (n = 7) and nitrofen-treated (n = 7) dams were harvested on embryonic day 13. The expression of GATA4, GATA6, Wnt2, BMP4, and MEF2C was analyzed in each heart by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase reaction.
The gene expression of GATA4, GATA6, Wnt2, BMP4, and MEF2C on embryonic day 13 were significantly reduced (P < .05) in the hearts of nitrofen-treated animals compared with normal hearts of equivalent age.
Decreased expression of GATA4 and GATA6 and their target genes in the developing fetal heart may perturb the delicate regulation of cardiovascular development, resulting in cardiovascular malformations in the nitrofen rat model.
Intracerebroventricular injection of ethacrynic acid (50% convulsive dose; 50 micrograms/mouse) accelerated the synthesis/turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) but suppressed the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid and acetylcholine in mouse brain. These effects were completely antagonized by pretreatment with a glutamate/N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, aminophosphonovaleric acid. In ethacrynic acid-induced convulsions, these neurotransmitter systems may be differentially modulated, probably through activation of glutaminergic neurons in the brain.
Male ICR mice were administered allyl chloride at dose of 496 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg, 720 mg/kg, 864 mg/kg or 1037 mg/kg by a single subcutaneous injection. Sixteen of 25 mice died by the 7th day after the injection and LD50 was calculated 621 mg/kg body weight (95% C.I.: 522-739 mg/kg). A marked congestion with severe hemorrhage and edema were observed in the lung. Liver and kidney damages were also found, and these were characterized by the dilated sinusoids, degenerative change of hepatic cells, and focal necrosis in the liver; and necrosis of epithelium in convoluted tubules of the kidneys. Nine mice have survived by the 7th day after the injection and all of them showed a various degree of damages in the testes. The testicular lesions could be classified into two types. One type of the lesion was characterized by degeneration and exfoliation of germ cells, appearance of polynuclear giant cells in the seminiferous tubules, and mild proliferation of Leydig cells in the interstitium. In another type of the lesion, all type of cells in tubules, including Sertoli cells, and Leydig cells became necrotic. This is the first study reporting the testicular toxicity of allyl chloride.
Retinoids play an important role in lung development. A recent study has demonstrated that prenatal treatment with retinoic acid (RA) stimulates alveologenesis in hypoplastic lungs in the nitrofen model of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that the differentiation from alveolar epithelial cells type II (AECs-II) into alveolar epithelial cells type I (AECs-I), which is the key process in lung development, is disturbed in this model. We hypothesized that retinoids promote alveologenesis by stimulating differentiation of AECs-II to AECs-I at the end of gestation; and therefore, we investigated the effect of RA on the pulmonary expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), a marker for AECs-I, and thyroid transcription factor 1 (Ttf-1), a marker for AECs-II, in nitrofen-induced hypoplastic lungs.
Pregnant rats were exposed to either olive oil or 100 mg nitrofen on day of gestation (D) 9. Five milligrams per kilogram of RA was given intraperitoneally on D18, D19, and D20; and fetuses were recovered on D21. We had 4 study groups: control (n = 7), control + RA (n = 7), CDH (n = 6), and CDH + RA (n = 6). The expression of ICAM-1 and Ttf-1 was analysed in each lung by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. One-way analysis of variance test was used for statistical analysis.
Expression levels of ICAM-1 were significantly reduced in CDH lungs compared with normal controls, whereas levels increased significantly in CDH group after the addition of RA (P < .05). Expression levels of Ttf-1 were significantly decreased in lungs from RA-treated CDH animals compared with CDH without RA (P < .05). The ICAM-1 and Ttf-1 immunoreactivity demonstrated similar pattern of expression in various groups.
Our results demonstrate that prenatal treatment with RA accelerates AEC-I proliferation in the hypoplastic lung in CDH.
To characterize actions of inhibitors of hydrochloric acid secretion on gastric function and to formulate indications to using different antisecretory drugs in ulcer disease (UD).
Of 120 examinees with duodenal ulcer (DU), 40 received gastrocepin, 40--famotidin, 40--omeprasol. Follow-up study was made of motor, acid-, pepsin- and mucus-forming functions of the stomach.
By reducing production of acid and pepsin, gastrocepin is inferior to famotidin and omeprasol. Gastrocepin is more effective than famotidin and omeprasol in motor-evacuatory dysfunction. Gastrocepin improves defensive properties of gastric mucus better.
The results expand indications for a differential administration of antisecretory drugs in UD.
In this mini-review are first presented data which highlight the capacity and characteristics for estrogen to act as a neuroprotectant of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Estrogen administration significantly attenuates the degree of striatal dopamine depletion to neurotoxins (MPTP, 6-OHDA and methamphetamine) which target the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. This neuroprotection appears maximal with the 17-beta isomer, but some neuroprotection may also be present with the 17-alpha isomer of estradiol. Treatment with the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen, abolished estrogen's neuroprotective effects upon MPTP or methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Estrogen also preserves striatal dopamine concentrations in gonadectomized male mice treated with MPTP, but neither testosterone nor dihydrotestosterone offer any neuroprotection. A brief review indicating a variety of potential means by which estrogen can function as a neuroprotectant is indicated. Included within this survey are presented estrogen's action as an antioxidant along with its capacity to affect monoamine oxidase, dopamine receptors/release, membrane morphology/fluidity, thermoregulation, blood flow and nitric oxide. This discussion is followed by a more detailed description of estrogen's actions upon the dopamine transporter, which is hypothesized to serve as one of the major mechanism involved with nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuroprotection. Overall, estrogen appears to inhibit dopamine transporter function by decreasing the affinity of the transporter. Such an effect could prevent neurotoxic agents from entering dopamine nerve terminals, thereby decreasing nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. Finally, some implications regarding this neuroprotectant capacity of estrogen are considered.
Respiratory toxicity, injury and treatment following vapor inhalational exposure to the chemical warfare nerve agent (CWNA) soman (GD) were examined in non-anesthetized rats. This study exposed male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300g) to 520, 560, 600, 825 or 1410mg×min/m(3) of soman in a customized head-out inhalation system. Signs of CWNA-induced cholinergic crises were observed in all soman-exposed animals. The LCt50 of vaporized soman as determined by probit analysis was 593.1mg×min/m(3). All animals exposed to 825 and 1410mg×min/m(3) developed severe convulsions and died within 4-8min post-exposure. Edema measured by wet/dry weight ratio of the left lung lobe increased in a dose-dependent manner in all soman-exposed animals. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and blood acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were inhibited dose-dependently in soman-exposed groups at 24h. A significant increase in total BAL protein was observed in soman-exposed animals at all doses. AChE activity was inhibited in lung and whole brain tissues in all soman-exposed animals. Histopathological analysis of the lungs of animals exposed to 600mg×min/m(3) of soman revealed prominent morphological changes including alveolar histiocytosis, hemorrhage and inflammation consisting of neutrophilic exudate. Exposure of animals to 600mg×min/m(3) of soman followed by treatment with two actuations for 10s of Combivent (21μg of ipratropium bromide and 120μg of albuterol sulfate) and Symbicort (80μg budesonide and 4.5μg formoterol) by inhalation into a modified metered dose inhaler (MDI) 10min post-exposure resulted in increased minute volume, but did not decrease mortality. These results indicate that inhalation exposure to soman vapor causes acute respiratory toxicity and injury in untreated, un-anesthetized rats and that inhalation treatment with Combivent or Symbicort did improve the respiratory outcomes, but did not influence lethality.
