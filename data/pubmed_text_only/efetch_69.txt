Telithromycin, a ketolide antibiotic used for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections, is widely prescribed in primary care practice. Treatment-related adverse events are mainly of gastrointestinal origin and generally mild in intensity. The authors report the first case of telithromycin-induced severe acute interstitial nephritis. Practitioners should be aware of the possibility that telithromycin therapy could result in this form of drug-induced acute renal failure.
Apart from allergic mechanisms, a lack or mutation of metabolic enzymes may cause adverse drug reactions. Patch testing has rarely been useful in cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) induced by diphenylhydantoin (DPH). Genetic polymorphisms leading to altered metabolic processes of cytochrome P(450) (CYP) 2C9, a main metabolic enzyme for DPH, may be the pathological mechanism for certain cases of DPH-induced CADRs.
To examine the effects of an altered CYP2C9 variant, CYP2C9*3, on DPH-induced CADRs.
Ten patients with DPH-induced CADRs were examined for CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms. The results were compared with non-exposed controls and 39 neurological patients without DPH-induced CADRs despite exposure to DPH. The patients with DPH-induced CADRs were also patch tested with anti-epileptic drugs and the results were compared with 40 DPH-exposed and 58 non-exposed controls.
A heterozygous CYP2C9*3 variant was found in three of the 10 DPH-induced CADR patients. The crude odds ratios (OR) of the patients compared with those of exposed and non-exposed controls were 167 and 71, respectively. Only one neurological patient, who had never taken DPH, showed the variant in both exposed (P=0.007) and non-exposed (P=0.001) controls. Positive patch-test results were displayed in three of the ten DPH-induced patients, but the patients with positive patch-test reactions to DPH differed from those with the CYP2C9*3 polymorphism. No patients and controls displayed a CYP2C9*2 variant.
A CYP2C9*3 variant could play a role in the proportion of patients with DPH-induced CADRs that differ from patients with DPH-induced CADRs showing positive patch-test results.
A variety of pathophysiologic processes are activated in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), and some of these have been implicated in the progression of the disease. The most important processes to be activated in CHF are the neurohormonal systems, which include the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathetic nervous system, and the endothelin system. In addition to the neurohormonal systems, the formation of reactive oxygen free radicals is increased in patients with CHF. It has been postulated that stimulation of neurohormonal pathways and the formation of oxygen free radicals ultimately lead to the activation of a family of transcription factors that are involved in cardiac remodeling, which is a hallmark of CHF. In addition, the formation of oxygen free radicals has been implicated in the process of apoptosis or programmed cell death, which may be responsible for a continued loss of myocardial cells, resulting in the progressive decrease in left ventricular function that occurs over time in patients with CHF. Carvedilol is a multiple-action neurohormonal antagonist that is effective in slowing the progression of CHF. In double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, carvedilol decreased mortality by 65% (p <0.001) and significantly reduced hospitalization. Carvedilol is a nonselective beta-blocker and vasodilator, the latter activity resulting from alpha1-adrenoceptor blockade. The hemodynamic responses produced by carvedilol result primarily from the blockade of beta1-, beta2-, and alpha1-adrenoceptors. Carvedilol reduces total peripheral vascular resistance and preload without significantly compromising cardiac output or eliciting reflex tachycardia. Carvedilol is also a potent antioxidant that may protect the myocardium from damage produced by oxygen radicals and, as a consequence of its antioxidant activity, carvedilol also inhibits apoptosis in the myocardium. The ability of carvedilol to inhibit apoptosis in the heart may be responsible, in part, for the ability of the drug to reduce mortality and to inhibit the progression of CHF.
Hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) are additive brominated flame retardants mainly used in plastics and textiles. At the present time, these compounds are found in almost all environmental and human samples. In order to evaluate the environmental safety and health risk of HBCDs, the enantiomerically pure alpha-, beta-, and gamma-HBCD were prepared using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a PM-beta-CD column and the cytotoxicities of their enantiomers were evaluated in Hep G2 cells. Results from the 3-(4,5-dimethylthioazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), resazurin reduction and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays showed a good agreement that the order of cytotoxicity was gamma-HBCDbeta-HBCD>alpha-HBCD, and that significantly lower cell viability and higher LDH release were observed in all (+)-enantiomers ((+) alpha-, (+) beta- and (+) gamma-HBCD) than the corresponding (-)-forms ((-) alpha-, (-) beta- and (-) gamma-HBCD). Additionally, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by these HBCD enantiomers were detected. The positive correlation between the LDH release and ROS formation demonstrated that the toxic mechanism might be mediated by oxidative damage. These results suggest that environmental and human health risks of HBCDs must be evaluated at the level of individual enantiomers.
Ninety-nine patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate for connective tissue diseases during a seven year period. All patients received the medication for at least one year and most were treated with a daily dosage of 400 mg. Four patients experienced toxic effects, but no patient sustained permanent loss of visual acuity. Toxicity did not seem to represent a cumulative dosage effect. Funduscopic and visual field examinations at six-month intervals are sufficient to detect the occasional adverse reactions and prevent serious retinal toxic effects when a maximum daily dosage of 400 mg is maintained.
Retinoic acid (RA) (78mg/kg) administered to ICR mice on days 9.0,9.5 and 10.0 of pregnancy (plug day = day 1), resulted in cardiac malformations in 37.6% of the surviving fetuses, including transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defects, and double outlet right ventricle. Histological examination of the hearts of embryos observed 24 hours after in vivo or in vitro exposure to RA on day 9 revealed abnormalities in endocardial cushion tissue. The volume of the atrioventricular endocardial was reduced in treated embryos as was the ratio of the size of the cushions to the size of the heart. The endothelial layer of the atrioventricular endocardial cushions appeared to be unaffected by the retinoic acid, however, the mesenchymal cushion cells were significantly reduced in number when compared with controls. Labeling with [3H]-thymidine indicated that the mitotic activity of the mesenchymal cell population was significantly decreased while that of the endothelial cells was comparable to control levels. The extracellular matrix or cardiac jelly of the endocardial cushions also appeared to be affected by RA exposure, as shown by studies utilizing colloidal iron to stain GAGs, which revealed a decrease in the amount of stainable material in treated cushions. Two possible cause for the reduced thymidine index of the cushion mesenchyme are discussed, namely, a direct effect of RA on the mesenchymal cells or an indirect effect via the altered extracellular matrix of the cushion tissue.
The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of anti-inflammatory on activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and mRNA and protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in intestinal mucosal biopsy specimens from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). A total of 27 cases with UC were investigated. 15 cases received sulfasalazine (SASP) treatment or SASP and glucocorticoid treatment, 12 cases did not receive any medication related with UC. Normal mucosa from 9 colon cancer cases served as control. Ten pieces of intestinal mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained from each patient. The mRNA expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were determined by reversal transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NF-kappaB DNA binding activity was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The results showed that NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were increased significantly in patients with UC, compared with normal control (P<0.05). Glucocorticoids and SASP markedly inhibited NF-kappaB activation and significantly decreased mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (P<0.05). Adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) gene activation had significant positive correlation with the NF-kappaB DNA binding activity (r=0.8652 P<0.05, r=0.7902, P<0.05, respectively). We concluded that NF-kappaB is a major and essential factor in regulating the expression of adhesion molecules, it plays an important role in the pathogenesis of UC. SASP and glucocorticoids ameliorate UC via inhibition of NF-kappaB activation and reduction of adhesion molecules expression.
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of Bazhen decoction on bone marrow depression induced by cyclophosphamide (CY) in mice. An experimental model of mouse bone marrow injury was established through cyclophosphamide induced and the following phenomena were observed. The techniques of culture of hematopoietic progenitor cell and hematopoietic growth factor assay were used. Bazhen decoction could obviously promote the proliferation of bone marrow cells of anaemic mice. The culture media of spleen cell, macrophage, lung and skeletal muscle treated with Bazhen decoction had much stronger stimulating effects on hematopoietic cells. The bone marrow cells of the anaemic mice could yield TNF through Bazhen decoction treatment. It was suggested that Bazhen decoction is clinically a hopeful drug used to cure bone marrow depression and attenuate the side effects of CY.
The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a recently identified fusion-type oncoprotein that exists in approximately 5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has been demonstrated that NSCLC driven by EML4-ALK is strongly addicted to this fusion-type oncokinase. A clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066) sponsored by Pfizer has proven this oncogene addiction in humans by demonstrating a high response rate to inhibition of ALK kinase activity. In the present study, we report on three cases harboring EML4-ALK rearrangement who were enrolled in the trial (A8081001, NCT00585195). All three patients showed favorable responses to the ALK-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
Our previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of resveratrol, a grape constituent noted for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, in reducing temporary threshold shifts and decreasing cochlear hair cell damage following noise exposure. This study was designed to identify the potential protective mechanism of resveratrol by measuring its effect on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation following noise exposure.
Controlled animal intervention study.
Otology Laboratory, Henry Ford Health System.
Twenty-two healthy male Fischer 344 rats (2-3 months old) were exposed to acoustic trauma of variable duration with or without intervention. An additional 20 healthy male rats were used to study COX-2 expression at different time points during and following treatment of 24 hours of noise exposure. Cochlear harvest was performed at various time intervals for measurement of COX-2 protein expression via Western blot analysis and immunostaining. Peripheral blood was also obtained for ROS analysis using flow cytometry.
Acoustic trauma exposure resulted in a progressive up-regulation of COX-2 protein expression, commencing at 8 hours and peaking at 32 hours. Similarly, ROS production increased after noise exposure. However, treatment with resveratrol reduced noise-induced COX-2 expression as well as ROS formation in the blood as compared with the controls.
COX-2 levels are induced dramatically following noise exposure. This increased expression may be a potential mechanism of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and a possible mechanism of resveratrol's ability to mitigate NIHL by its ability to reduce COX-2 expression.
Nanoparticles were formulated with biodegradable monomethoxy (poly ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-monomethoxy (poly ethylene glycol) of three different proportional (PEG-PLGA-PEG, lactic acid: glycolic acid = 80/20, 70/30, 50/50) and the cytotoxicity of nanoparticle was characterized according to US Pharmacopoeia XXIII recommendations on various cell lines, including L929, Chang's hepatocytes, primary mouse myoblasts, osteoblasts, and renal vascular endothelial cells. mIL-18 gene was first condensed by polycationic peptide polylysine (PLL), and then encapsulated in the PEG-PLGA-PEG NPs as a novel multi-polyplex gene delivery system - Polymer-PLL-DNA. (PPDs) After lyopholization, the morphology, particle size, zeta potential, and the integrity of DNA in the NPs were investigated. The expression of mIL-18 gene on CT-26 cells in vitro were determined by western blot, while in vivo efficacy was evaluated by tumor inhibition rate, histological section, and survival curve in pulmonary metastasis of colon cancer in BALB/c mice model. Results showed that the cytotoxicity of blank nanoparticles was related to the degradation properties of the polymers with different compositions. The NPs with LA:GA = 70/30 (NPs-73) was optimal for intravenous injection due to its low cytotoxicity. Physicochemical properties of the PPDs were not changed during the lyopholization, while mIL-18 was successfully expressed in vitro. The anti-tumor efficacy in vivo of PPDs showed improvement especially combined with chemotherapy of cisplatin, and confirmed the promising application of the PPDs system, which compared with any single treatment.
The group of the investigated included 25 individuals (11 F, 14 M), aged 55 +/- 1.5 years, with diabetes type II and hypertension. Known diabetes duration was 4.9 +/- 0.8 years and known hypertension duration--7.4 +/- 1.4 years. Two weeks after administering placebo in place of hypertension drugs applied so far, guanfacine was included as the only hypertensive drug. The dosage was increased from 0.5 mg up to 3 mg daily until a good control of blood pressure was achieved. The diabetic treatment, diet and the smoking habit were unchanged. The resting activity of the renin-angiotension-aldosterone system (RAA), cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL, serum glucose levels and HbA1c were assayed after a 5-month guanfacine period. After treatment a significant decrease in blood pressure both systolic and diastolic (p < 0.001), heart rate (p < 0.005) and plasma renin activity (p < 0.02) were observed. Preliminary measurements of RAA activity and its changes during treatment were not helpful in predicting guanfacine hypotensive effect. The level of lipids, lipoproteins, atherogenic factors, glucose and HbA1c did not change significantly during the study.
We report a case of primary ventricular fibrillation following withdrawal of lithium in a patient concurrently taking chlorpromazine. A potentially important drug interaction is discussed.
Transsexuals receive cross-sex hormone treatment. Its short-term use appears reasonably safe. Little is known about its long-term use. This report offers some perspectives.
The setting was a university hospital serving as the national referral center for The Netherlands (16 million people).
From the start of the gender clinic in 1975 up to 2006, 2236 male-to-female and 876 female-to-male transsexuals have received cross-sex hormone treatment. In principle, subjects are followed up lifelong.
Male-to-female transsexuals receive treatment with the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate 100 mg/d plus estrogens (previously 100 microg ethinyl estradiol, now 2-4 mg oral estradiol valerate/d or 100 microg transdermal estradiol/d). Female-to-male transsexuals receive parenteral testosterone esters 250 mg/2 wk. After 18-36 months, surgical sex reassignment including gonadectomy follows, inducing a profound hypogonadal state.
Outcome measures included morbidity and mortality data and data assessing risks of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.
Mortality was not higher than in a comparison group. Regarding morbidity, with ethinyl estradiol, there was a 6-8% incidence of venous thrombosis, which is no longer the case with use of other types of estrogens. Continuous use of cross-sex hormones is required to prevent osteoporosis. Androgen deprivation plus an estrogen milieu in male-to-female transsexuals has a larger deleterious effect on cardiovascular risk factors than inducing an androgenic milieu in female-to-male transsexuals, but there is so far no elevated cardiovascular morbidity/mortality. Low numbers of endocrine-related cancers have been observed in male-to-female transsexuals.
Cross-sex hormone treatment of transsexuals seems acceptably safe over the short and medium term, but solid clinical data are lacking.
Effects of intrathecally (i.t.) administered R-phenylisopropyl adenosine (R-PIA), an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, on presumed pain behaviour were assessed in a rat model of chronic central pain. Spinal cord injury was induced photochemically via laser irradiation of the spinal cord after intravenous injection of erythrosin B in rats. The chronic allodynia-like behaviour that developed in some animals was studied. R-PIA (3 and 10 nmol), injected i.t. reduced the mechanical and cold allodynia-like symptoms as tested with von Frey filaments and ethyl-chloride spray, respectively. No side effects were observed. The effect of R-PIA was significant for up to 5 h and was reversed by theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist.
1. The case of a schizophrenic patient taking bromperidol (18 mg/day), whose psychotic symptoms deteriorated markedly after addition of cisapride (7.5 mg/day), is presented. 2. Retrospective determination of drug concentrations revealed that plasma concentrations of bromperidol and its reduced metabolite were increased after cisapride addition. 3. The present study thus suggests that there is an interaction between cisapride and bromperidol.
Among 20 white non-inbred rats of the "Rappolovo" nursery for laboratory animals of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, which were fed through all their life N-/4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl/formamide in the concentration 0.188%, transition-cell vesical tumors developed in 4 animals at the 56th, 60th, 61st 70th week of the experiment. After 71--81 weeks since the onset of the experiment, cancer of this organ developed in the remaining 14 animals. The maximum total dose of the carcinogen was 14.4 g/ per rat. The maximum observation terms--567 days.
The norepinephrine (NE)-induced hypertrophy of the left ventricle (LV) in the rat is preceded by increased interleukin (IL)-6 expression and associated with LV fibrosis. We have examined whether the elevated level of IL-6 may be due to mast cell degranulation. Therefore we tested the effect of cromoglycate sodium salt (cromolyn), an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation with anti-inflammatory and membrane-stabilizing activity, on the increased expression of IL-6 mRNA and of mRNAs of proteins involved in the remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) which is induced by NE (0.1 mg/kg x h). After 4 h, the NE-induced increase in IL-6 mRNA expression was not influenced by cromolyn (20 mg/kg x h). Cromolyn-infusion for 3 days did not affect the extent of LV hypertrophy induced by NE, as measured by the LV weight/body weight (LVW/BW) ratio and by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) expression. Cromolyn induced a slight depression of the NE-induced elevation of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2. However, it did not affect the NE-induced elevated levels of mRNAs of collagen I and III and the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2. Since cromolyn did not reduce the NE-effects in rat hearts in vivo we conclude that mast cell degranulation seems not to be involved in them.
Prophylaxis against recurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), in combination with antiviral agents such as lamivudine, has allowed transplantation for this condition to become feasible and accepted. Current protocols allow for HBIG administration either intravenously or intramuscularly. To date, there has been no reported experience with the subcutaneous route of post-transplant HBIG delivery. We report our experience of a 60-yr-old man for whom liver transplantation was performed for chronic HBV. HBIG was administered intramuscularly during the anhepatic phase of surgery. The finding of a portal vein thrombosis requiring repeated thrombectomy necessitated chronic anticoagulation. Post-operatively, HBIG was administered subcutaneously, in four separate injections, for a daily dose of 2170 IU along with continued lamivudine dosing. Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titres reached a serum concentration of >500 IU/L by seven d post-transplant and approximately 1000 IU/L by nine d post-transplant. Five months post-transplant, with continued combination of subcutaneous HBIG and lamivudine, there has been no recurrent HBV infection and anti-HBs titres have been at target levels. Our experience suggests that subcutaneous delivery of HBIG may be a feasible consideration when intramuscular/intravenous dosing is not possible.
This phase I, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study assessed the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of a 4-week course of once-daily, sequential ascending doses (0.75, 2.5, or 7.5 mg/day) of SDZ-RAD (RAD) capsules in renal transplant recipients on a stable regimen of cyclosporine (CsA; Neoral) and prednisone.
RAD displayed a similar spectrum of side effects as observed with rapamycin, namely, an increased incidence of infection associated with the augmented immunosuppression and a dose-related occurrence of thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, particularly at the 7.5-mg dose. The pharmacokinetic parameters of RAD showed dose proportionality, a good correlation between trough and area under the curve (AUC) concentrations, and a moderate accumulation of 2.5-fold. The drug was absorbed within 2 hr and displayed a 16-19-hr half-life, which is shorter than that of rapamycin. RAD reached steady state at 4 days. Preliminary kinetic-dynamic correlations indicate a correlation between thrombocytopenia (but not hyperlipidemia) and AUC, as well as maximum drug concentrations, and weight-adjusted dose. At the end of a 4-week course of simultaneous dosing, there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between CsA and RAD.
This study suggests that the shorter half-life of RAD compared to rapamycin may confer the benefits of rapid attainment of steady state and dissipation of effects upon drug cessation. Controlled, multicenter trials are being planned to assess the impact of these features on clinical outcomes.
Our work has focused on the carcinogenic effects of in utero arsenic exposure in mice. Our data show that a short period of maternal exposure to inorganic arsenic in the drinking water is an effective, multi-tissue carcinogen in the adult offspring. These studies have been reproduced in three temporally separate studies using two different mouse strains. In these studies pregnant mice were treated with drinking water containing sodium arsenite at up to 85 ppm arsenic from days 8 to 18 of gestation, and the offspring were observed for up to 2 years. The doses used in all these studies were well tolerated by both the dam and offspring. In C3H mice, two separate studies show male offspring exposed to arsenic in utero developed liver carcinoma and adrenal cortical adenoma in a dose-related fashion during adulthood. Prenatally exposed female C3H offspring show dose-related increases in ovarian tumors and lung carcinoma and in proliferative lesions (tumors plus preneoplastic hyperplasia) of the uterus and oviduct. In addition, prenatal arsenic plus postnatal exposure to the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in C3H mice produces excess lung tumors in both sexes and liver tumors in females. Male CD1 mice treated with arsenic in utero develop tumors of the liver and adrenal and renal hyperplasia while females develop tumors of urogenital system, ovary, uterus and adrenal and hyperplasia of the oviduct. Additional postnatal treatment with diethylstilbestrol or tamoxifen after prenatal arsenic in CD1 mice induces urinary bladder transitional cell proliferative lesions, including carcinoma and papilloma, and enhances the carcinogenic response in the liver of both sexes. Overall this model has provided convincing evidence that arsenic is a transplacental carcinogen in mice with the ability to target tissues of potential human relevance, such as the urinary bladder, lung and liver. Transplacental carcinogenesis clearly occurs with other agents in humans and investigating a potential transplacental component of the human carcinogenic response to arsenic should be a research priority.
An analysis was made of the occurrence of anticholinergic side effects in 15 multicenter studies of 379 patients with endogenous depression who received either trazodone, imipramine, or placebo. The incidence of 4 anticholinergic side effects was examined: dry mouth, blurred vision, bowel movement disturbance, and delayed urine flow. When the number of patients having each of the 4 symptoms was compared, there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of side effects between the trazodone and placebo groups. However, comparisons between trazodone and imipramine indicated the incidence of side effects was significantly lower in the trazodone group.
Supraventricular arrhythmias complicating acute illnesses were treated with intravenously administered practolol, a cardioselective beta adrenergic blocking agent. Slowing of atrioventricular conduction resulted in rapid control of ventricular rate in 23 of 33 episodes (70 percent) in 31 patients. Profound hypotension developed in two patients, presumably as a result of interference with adrenergic circulatory support. Serum levels from 19 patients showed no correlation with response to therapy and were much lower than levels previously reported necessary for slowing of tachycardias induced by isoproterenol and exercise. Response to practolol was maximum within 15 minutes and was not improved by additional dosage sufficient to raise serum levels. Practolol was a rapidly effective and safe antiarrhythmic agent in situations in which propranolol would be contraindicated and the risk of digitalis toxicity increased; it should be considered a primary drug for initiation of therapy for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.
