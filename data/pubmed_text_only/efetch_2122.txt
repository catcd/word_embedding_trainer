Severe colchicine myopathy occurred in a 24-year-old patient treated with colchicine because of familial mediterranean fever complicated by renal amyloidosis. In addition to prominent autophagic vacuoles containing heterogeneous osmiophilic material and pleomorphous bodies, cytoplasmic deposits of finely granular material were detected that have not been noted in previous cases of colchicine myopathy. This granular material was immunoreactive for antibodies to tubulin, alpha-tubulin, and beta-tubulin. These observations substantiate the suggestion that alterations of the microtubular network represent the initial step in the pathogenesis of colchicine myopathy.
D-Penicillamine (3,3-dimethyl-D-cysteine; DP) is an FDA-approved redox-active D-cysteine-derivative with antioxidant, disulfide-reducing, and metal chelating properties used therapeutically for the control of copper-related pathology in Wilson's disease and reductive cystine-solubilization in cystinuria. Based on the established sensitivity of metastatic melanoma cells to pharmacological modulation of cellular oxidative stress, we tested feasibility of using DP for chemotherapeutic intervention targeting human A375 melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. DP treatment induced caspase-dependent cell death in cultured human metastatic melanoma cells (A375, G361) without compromising viability of primary epidermal melanocytes, an effect not observed with the thiol-antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and dithiothreitol. Focused gene expression array analysis followed by immunoblot detection revealed that DP rapidly activates the cytotoxic unfolded protein response (UPR; involving phospho-PERK, phospho-eIF2α, Grp78, CHOP, and Hsp70) and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis with p53 upregulation and modulation of Bcl-2 family members (involving Noxa, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2). DP (but not NAC) induced oxidative stress with early impairment of glutathione homeostasis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential. SiRNA-based antagonism of PMAIP1 expression blocked DP-induced upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only effector Noxa and prevented downregulation of the Noxa-antagonist Mcl-1, rescuing melanoma cells from DP-induced apoptosis. Intraperitoneal administration of DP displayed significant antimelanoma activity in a murine A375 xenograft model. It remains to be seen if melanoma cell-directed induction of UPR and apoptosis using DP or improved DP-derivatives can be harnessed for future chemotherapeutic intervention.
Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), generated by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The key step in the generation of Abeta is cleavage of APP by beta-secretases (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and BACE2). There has been suggestion of interaction between aluminum and several AD-associated pathways. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. Here, we report the effects of aluminum chloride (AlCl(3)) in Abeta-induced toxicity using differentiated neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. The metal significantly enhances Abeta-induced cell death at concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microM after 24 and 48 h. After 72 and 96 h treatment, cell death is increased already at 10 microM. Early coexposure of cells to 10 microM AlCl(3) and 2 microM Abeta differentially affected beta-secretase mRNA levels as compared to single Abeta treatment after 1 and 3 h. BACE1 levels were slightly reduced after 1 h and significantly increased after 3 h exposure, whereas BACE2 levels were increased at both times considered. Both genes' mRNA levels were downregulated at longer times (6, 12, and 24 h). Although these results indicate that aluminum toxicity is correlated to changes in both BACE1 and BACE2 expression levels, the subsequent common downregulation observed suggests that aluminum involvement in the Abeta cascade is subtle, and other underlying mechanisms might be involved.
Ambient air pollutant exposure has been linked to childhood respiratory disease, but infants have received little study. The authors tested the hypotheses that subchronic and chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)), nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone increases risk of severe infant bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization. Study subjects were derived from linked birth-hospital-discharge records of infants born in 1995-2000 in the South Coast Air Basin of California. Cases with a hospital discharge for bronchiolitis in infancy were matched to 10 age- and gestational-age-matched controls. Exposures in the month prior to hospitalization (subchronic) and mean lifetime exposure (chronic) referenced to the case diagnosis date were assessed on the basis of data derived from the California Air Resources Board. In conditional logistic regression, only subchronic and chronic PM2.5 exposures were associated with increased risk of bronchiolitis hospitalization after adjustment for confounders (per 10-microg/m3 increase, adjusted odds ratio = 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.14) for both). Ozone was associated with reduced risk in the single-pollutant model, but this relation did not persist in multipollutant models including PM2.5. These unique US data suggest that infant bronchiolitis may be added to the list of adverse effects of PM2.5 exposure.
Pramanicin (PMC) is an antifungal agent that was previously demonstrated to exhibit antiangiogenic and anticancer properties in a few in vitro studies. We initially screened a number of PMC analogs for their cytotoxic effects on HCT116 human colon cancer cells. PMC-A, the analog with the most potent antiproliferative effect was chosen to further interrogate the underlying mechanism of action. PMC-A led to apoptosis through activation of caspase-9 and -3. The apoptotic nature of cell death was confirmed by abrogation of cell death with pretreatment with specific caspase inhibitors. Stress-related MAPKs JNK and p38 were both activated concomittantly with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of p38 proved to attenuate the cell death induction while pretreatment with JNK inhibitor did not exhibit a protective effect. Resistance of Bax -/- cells and the protective nature of caspase-9 inhibition indicate that mitochondria play a central role in PMC-A induced apoptosis. Early post-exposure elevation of cellular Bim and Bax was followed by a marginal Bcl-2 depletion and Bid cleavage. Further analysis revealed that Bcl-2 downregulation occurs at the mRNA level and is critical to mediate PMC-A induced apoptosis, as ectopic Bcl-2 expression substantially spared the cells from death. Conversely, forced expression of Bim proved to significantly increase cell death. In addition, analyses of p53-/- cells demonstrated that Bcl-2/Bim/Bax modulation and MAPK activations take place independently of p53 expression. Taken together, p53-independent transcriptional Bcl-2 downregulation and p38 signaling appear to be the key modulatory events in PMC-A induced apoptosis.
The hemodynamic responses to esmolol, an ultrashort-acting (t1/2 = 9 min) beta 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, were examined in 16 patients with myocardial ischemia and compromised left ventricular function as evidenced by a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 to 25 mm Hg. Esmolol was infused intravenously to a maximal dose of 300 micrograms/kg body weight per min for less than or equal to 48 h in 16 patients: 9 with acute myocardial infarction, 6 with periinfarction angina and 1 with acute unstable angina. The sinus rate and systolic arterial pressure declined rapidly in all patients from baseline values of 99 +/- 12 beats/min and 126 +/- 19 mm Hg to 80 +/- 14 beats/min (p less than 0.05) and 107 +/- 20 mm Hg (p less than or equal to 0.05) during esmolol treatment. Rate-pressure product decreased by 33% and cardiac index by 14% during esmolol treatment, but pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was not significantly altered by drug infusion (19 +/- 3 mm Hg at baseline versus 19 +/- 5 during treatment, p = NS). In all patients there was a rapid return toward baseline hemodynamic measurements within 15 min of stopping administration of esmolol, and virtually complete resolution of drug effect was evident within approximately 30 min. During infusion of esmolol, four of nine patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin required downward adjustment of nitroglycerin infusion rate to maintain systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that maternal 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) exposure on day 14 of gestation (GD14) in the rat results in dose-dependent retardation of both cell cycle progression and growth of embryonic liver. At this developmental stage, hepatic erythropoiesis is the primary source of new circulating fetal erythrocytes. This study examined dose-dependent hematological changes in the fetus after maternal 5-FU exposure (0, 20, 30, 40 mg/kg on GD14) to assess 1) hematopoiesis as a potential target for 5-FU developmental toxicity and 2) the role of the observed 5-FU-induced fetal anemia in adverse developmental outcome. Standard clinical hematological parameters, including hematocrit, hemoglobin content, and erythrocyte counts, were measured in fetal blood drawn by cardiac puncture. Dose-related deficits were observed in all of these parameters within 48 hr of 5-FU administration. Calculation of various red cell indices revealed a concomitant increase in mean cell volume and mean cell hemoglobin. These changes were preceded by depletion of hepatic precursor populations which was evident by 24 hr after maternal exposure to 30 or 40 mg/kg. At doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg there was full and moderate recovery, respectively, in these endpoints by 72 hr after dosing, but persistent deficits were observed at 40 mg/kg. Fluorescence microscopy of Höechst-stained fetal blood smears revealed that at both 48 and 72 hr after dosing, the proportion of nucleated yolk sac-derived erythrocytes was increased relative to control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurred in a 28-year-old woman treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) with methotrexate (MTX) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), off all therapy for 15 years, who was also heterozygous for alpha-1 antitrypsin (alpha-1 AT) deficiency. MTXD is responsible for the development of HCC in this patient. The literature concerning the incidence of HCC in patients treated with MTX and 6-MP and in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiencies is reviewed.
Adverse reactions to the standard dose (1,200 mg/day-1,500 mg/day) of azidothymidine (AZT) are serious. An in vitro pharmacokinetic study of intracellular AZT-5'-triphosphate suggested the feasibility of a clinical trial with reduced doses of AZT. A randomized trial with reduced doses of AZT (group A; 400 mg/day, n = 15, group B; 800 mg/day, n = 13), was conducted enrolling 28 patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The effective rate of AZT on CD4+ lymphocyte counts was similar for both groups, but the duration of the effect of AZT was significantly longer in group A (p less than 0.05). In group B, adverse reactions were more frequently observed (p less than 0.01), and AZT was withdrawn or the dose was reduced more frequently (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that AZT at a dose of 400 mg/day is less toxic, and is more beneficial for long-term treatment.
Although several approaches have been attempted for cocaine dependence, the pharmacological treatment of this serious disorder remains unclear. To date, desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant of great noradrenergic activity, has shown the best results. Reboxetine, a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, might be an effective therapeutic option for this severe drug addiction. The aim was preliminarily to assess reboxetine in a group of cocaine dependent patients, selected from The Madrid City Council Drug Addiction Program primary care centres.
Twenty six patients with a diagnosis of cocaine dependence disorder (DSM-IV 304.20) were selected to receive open treatment with reboxetine, 8 mg/day, for 12 weeks. Follow up assessments comprised cocaine consumption, treatment retention rate and change in standard structured psychometric instrument scores: cocaine selective severity assessment, Hamilton anxiety scale, Hamilton depression scale and clinical global impression, throughout the treatment period.
Data were obtained from 20 patients; 10 of them remained abstinent, whereas the other 10 consumed cocaine at some time during the study. The treatment retention rate at week 12 was 61.5%. The psychometric instrument mean scores showed marked decreases throughout the treatment period.
Reboxetine might be an effective and safe therapeutic option for cocaine dependence disorder. The aversive effects, as well as the high blockage reported by some patients consuming cocaine during the trial, might be related to treatment. If confirmed in large clinical trials, the trends suggested by this study would confirm the role of noradrenergic function in the treatment of cocaine dependence.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of diazinon and propoxur on liver and kidneys, following long term exposure of rabbits.
Ten New Zealand white female rabbits were used. The animals were divided into 5 groups, consisting of 2 animals each. Diazinon (groups 1 and 2) and propoxur (groups 3 and 4) were administered at 2 different doses, and group 5 served as the control group. Histopathological lesions in the liver and kidneys, oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage were evaluated.
Both pesticides induced focal inflammation and fibrosis in the liver and kidneys. The low dose of propoxur induced a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC), with no difference in reduced glutathione (GSH), while the high dose of propoxur induced an increase in GSH with no change in TAC. For diazinon-exposed animals, the opposite findings were observed. Both diazinon and propoxur induced a statistically significant oxidative DNA damage in the liver and kidneys and a subsequent increase in telomerase activity in these tissues, possibly as a counteracting mechanism. Furthermore, systemic inflammation, as depicted by the dose-dependent increase in telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), was observed in propoxur treated animals.
Histopathological lesions, oxidative stress and genotoxic effects were induced in liver and kidneys following long term exposure of rabbits to diazinon and propoxur.
Five corticosteroid ointments and placebo were compared in 17 volunteers with regard to their influence on normal skin under occlusive conditions. Each volunteer had six simultaneous applications on the forearms and six on the back. The trial was double-blind and lasted 4 weeks. The ointments were placed in randomized order. The treatments were 0.1 and 0.03% domoprednate, 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate, 0.1% betamethasone valerate, 0.05% clobetasole propionate and placebo. Skin thickness was measured on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28, transepidermal water loss on days 0, 14 and 28, while blood flow and telangiectasias were evaluated only on day 28 at termination of the trial. The skin thickness became significantly reduced on all corticosteroids, but not on placebo; 0.03% domoprednate, however, tended to have an intermediate position between placebo and the other ointments. The transepidermal water loss did not change. Rating of telangiectasia under stereomicroscope showed a significantly lower score after 0.03% domoprednate and placebo as compared to the other ointments. Assessment of telangiectasia by laser-Doppler flowmetry showed a similar tendency. It is concluded that 0.1% domoprednate is comparable to other topical corticosteroids with respect to atrophogeneity and formation of telangiectasia, but the 0.03% concentration seems to result in fewer side effects.
Mutation A30P in the alpha-synuclein gene is a cause of familial Parkinson disease. Transgenic mice expressing wild mouse and mutant human A30P alpha-synuclein, Tg5093 mice (Tg), show a progressive motor disorder characterized by tremor, rigidity, and dystonia, accompanied by accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the soma and neurites and by a conspicuous gliosis beginning in the hippocampal formation at the age of 7 to 8 months and spreading throughout the CNS. Impaired short-term changes in synaptic strength have also been documented in hippocampal slices from Tg mice. Alpha-synuclein aggregates of approximately 34 and 70 kDa, in addition to the band of 17 kDa, corresponding to the molecular weight of alpha-synuclein, were recovered in the PBS-soluble fraction of brain homogenates from Tg mice but not from brain samples from age-matched wildtype littermates. MPTP-treated Tg and wildtype mice produced alpha-synuclein aggregates in the PBS-, deoxycholate-, and SDS-soluble fractions. Aggregates of alpha-synuclein, although with different molecular weights, were also observed in rotenone-treated Tg and wildtype mice. Pull-down studies with members of the Rab protein family have shown that alpha-synuclein from Tg mice interacts with Rab3a, Rab5, and Rab8. This binding is not due to the amount of alpha-synuclein (levels of which are higher in Tg mice) and it is not dependent on the amount of Rab protein used in the assay. Rather, alpha-synuclein interactions with Rab proteins are due to mutant alpha-synuclein as demonstrated in Rab pull-down assays with recombinant of wildtype and mutant A30P human alpha-synuclein. Since Rab3a, Rab5, and Rab8 are important proteins involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and exocytosis at the synapse, vesicle endocytosis, and trans-Golgi transport, respectively, it can be suggested that these functions are impaired in Tg mice. This rationale is consistent with previous data showing that short-term hippocampal synaptic plasticity is altered and that alpha-synuclein accumulates in the cytoplasm of neurons in Tg mice.
Nephrotoxicity is a common complication of cisplatin chemotherapy and thus limits the use of cisplatin in clinic. The purinergic 2X7 receptor (P2X7R) plays important roles in inflammation and apoptosis in some inflammatory diseases; however, its roles in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity remain unclear. In this study, we first assessed the expression of P2X7R in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in C57BL/6 mice, and then we investigated the changes of renal function, histological injury, inflammatory response, and apoptosis in renal tissues after P2X7R blockade in vivo using an antagonist A-438079. Moreover, we measured the changes of nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing proteins (NLRP3) inflammasome components, oxidative stress, and proapoptotic genes in renal tissues in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity after treatment with A-438079. We found that the expression of P2X7R was significantly upregulated in the renal tubular epithelial cells in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity compared with that of the normal control group. Furthermore, pretreatment with A-438079 markedly attenuated the cisplatin-induced renal injury while lightening the histological damage, inflammatory response and apoptosis in renal tissue, and improved the renal function. These effects were associated with the significantly reduced levels of NLRP3 inflammasome components, oxidative stress, p53 and caspase-3 in renal tissues in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. In conclusions, our studies suggest that the upregulated activity of P2X7R might play important roles in the development of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, and P2X7R blockade might become an effective therapeutic strategy for this disease.
Activation of survival pathways has been associated with chemoresistance and progression of androgen independence which places a major obstacle to successful treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Deguelin, a rotenoid isolated from Mundulea sericea, has an anticancer effect against several types of cancers; however, the mechanism of its antitumor effects on prostate cancer is not well understood. The aim of our study was to elucidate the effect of deguelin on the growth of prostate cancer cells and its putative mechanism of action. Deguelin decreased the viability of both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells but not normal prostate epithelial cells. Downregulation of phosphorylated Akt and GSK-3β by deguelin promoted proteosomal degradation of β-catenin that resulted in decreased nuclear accumulation and inhibited transactivation of β-catenin-responsive genes. Deguelin-induced downregulation of proliferative (cyclin D1 and c-myc) and antiapoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and survivin) in prostate cancer cells culminated in the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell growth, altered membrane integrity, marked reduction of invasiveness, inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent colony formation. Our data demonstrated for the first time that deguelin inhibits the growth and survival of human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, and its anticancer and antimetastatic activity occurs, at least in part through downregulating GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway and antiapoptotic survival proteins. Taken together our study indicates that deguelin may have translational potential as therapeutic agent for advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.
Eight evaluable patients with cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (6 patients), small cell lung cancer (1 patient), or both breast and ovarian cancer (1 patient) were entered on a study to determine whether the addition of nifedipine plus pentoxifylline to cisplatin-based chemotherapy would result in increased chemotherapy efficacy. No patient responded to treatment. Myelosuppression may have been augmented by the nifedipine and pentoxifylline (median granulocyte nadir, 0.3 x 10(9)/L). Two patients developed febrile neutropenia. Nifedipine and pentoxifylline had to be stopped in two evaluable patients due to hypotension, and three additional inevaluable patients withdrew from the study due to nifedipine-pentoxifylline toxicity before receiving their chemotherapy. There was no indication that other types of chemotherapy toxicity were increased by the addition of nifedipine and pentoxifylline. A major problem with the strategy followed in this protocol was that patients whose tumors had failed to respond to cisplatin-based regimens were often too ill to tolerate additional cisplatin, particularly when accompanied by nifedipine-associated hypotension.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of intraureteral streptokinase instillations for the resolution of an insoluble blood clot in the renal pelvis.
A patient with renal adenocarcinoma had prolonged hematuria related to involvement of the "pyelum" by the tumor. An insoluble blood clot obstruction of the left renal collecting system developed as a consequence of epsilon aminocaproic acid therapy, which was treated with low dose streptokinase through a ureteral catheter.
Complete resolution of the clot and obstruction occurred within 3 days of therapy.
This relatively simple approach should be used for the treatment of obstruction before radical surgery is performed.
We present a case of a patient who developed two episodes of angioedema after taking acetylsalicylic acid orally. Specific IgE antibodies to acetylsalicylic human serum albumin (ASA-HSA) were found. A control group of 37 patients with aspirin intolerance was studied and evidence of specific IgE antibodies was not found. The follow-up of this case shows that in a short period of time the level of specific IgE antibody decreases to undetectable levels similar to the negative control population.
There are few moderately active single-agents for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head & neck cancer. Thus, the identification of novel active agents is warranted. We performed the present phase II trial to evaluate activity and toxicity of vinorelbine (VNB) in previously treated patients with advanced head & neck cancer.
16 patients entered the study, 15 of whom were evaluable. The main characteristics were: M/F = 14/1; median age of 58 yrs (18-67); median PS (Karnofsky score) of 70 (60-100); primitive tumor sites were: oropharynx in 5; larynx in 4, hypopharynx in 3, rhynopharynx in 2, and oral cavity in 1 patient; initial clinical stage was IV in 9, III in 4 and II in 2 patients. Previous treatments were: cisplatinum with concurrent radiotherapy in 6 and cisplatinum + fluorouracil (for at least 2 cycles) in 9 patients. VNB was given at the dose of 20 mg/m2 i.v. infusion for 1 hr, weekly, for a minimum of 8 doses. Response and toxicity were evaluated after at least 8 doses of VNB.
Overall, 139 courses of VNB were given (median 9, range 8-19). Objective responses were: partial response in 1 patient (6%); stable disease, lasting at least 2 months, in 4 patients (27%) and progression in the other 10 patients (67%). Three patients had a one week delay in subsequent courses due to severe hematological toxicity. Toxicities observed were: leucopenia of grade IV (W.H.O.) in 2 patients and of grade I-II in 12 patients; granulocytopenia of grade III in 1 patient and of grade IV in 2 patients; grade I-II anemia in 4 patients; grade II phlebitis in 3 patients; grade II constipation in 2 patients, grade I-II peripheral neuropathy in 3 patients, grade I-II nausea and vomiting in 4 patients, and grade II stomatitis in 2 patients.
VNB, in this series of heavily pre-treated patients with head & neck cancer, did not reveal an antitumor activity of interest.
The antitumor activity and toxicity of trimetrexate (TMTX) was evaluated in measurable, hormone-refractory, advanced prostate cancer patients. Patients were required to have an ECOG performance status < 3, bidimensionally measurable disease, serum creatinine < or = 1.5 mg/dL, normal bone marrow function, and adequate hepatic function. Prior non-hormonal systemic therapy, active infection, third space effusions were exclusion criteria. TMTX 12 mg/m2 daily for five days (8 mg/m2 for patients with any prior radiation therapy or age > or = 75 years) was administered every 3 weeks. There were no responses in the 18 eligible patients. Median time to treatment failure and median survival were 6 and 20 weeks, respectively. Myelosuppression was the most frequent toxicity observed and was mild to severe in all but 4 patients. Two patients whom experienced life-threatening reversible leukopenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia developed in 2 further patients. Non-hematologic toxicity was also reversible and was mild to severe. TMTX at this dose and schedule is inactive in advanced, hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
The aims of our study were (1) to compare the dose of clozapine needed to achieve remission in patients who stopped their treatment (study group) versus patients who continued taking this medication (control group) and (2) to compare the clinical characteristics of remission between these 2 groups.
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all treatment-resistant schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients (according to DSM-IV criteria) who were treated with clozapine over a period of 9 years, from January 1995 through December 2003. The study group consisted of 43 patients and the control group of 12 patients. All patients' files from both groups were examined, and each patient's remission was scored twice--initially on discharge from the hospital and subsequently after final discharge for the study group, or at the end of the study for the control group.
The change of clozapine dose from the first to the last remission expressed by percentage shows a significant difference between the 43% increase in clozapine dose in the study group and the 12.5% decrease in clozapine dose in the control group (p < .001). Quality of remission assessment showed deterioration in the global remission score in the study group, while the quality of remission assessment in the control group did not show any change.
Our findings suggest that the discontinuation of clozapine treatment leads to a deterioration in the quality of remission, with a need for an increased dose of clozapine. Further prospective studies on larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.
In previous studies, we found that progesterone was able to induce the expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in human breast cancer MCF7 cells. Knowing that imatinib mesylate targets PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity, the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of imatinib on progesterone-treated MCF7 cells. Expression of phosphorylated (activated) platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRalpha) was detected in MCF7 cells. Interestingly, phosphorylated-PDGFRalpha expression was significantly downregulated by imatinib. The effects of imatinib on cell growth, apoptosis and migration were then analyzed. Imatinib effectively inhibited anchorage-dependent colony formation, and cell viability as evaluated by MTT assay. Corroborating these findings, a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells was also observed when cells were treated with imatinib. Surprisingly, these inhibitory effects were all enhanced by the presence of progesterone. Cell migration assays did also show a reduction in the migratory capacity after incubation with imatinib. These findings reveal that imatinib acts by decreasing MCF7 cell viability, growth and migration, with concomitant increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, incubation with progesterone seems to prompt cells to the inhibitory action of imatinib, probably by sustaining PDGFRalpha activity. The current study points out imatinib as a possible therapeutic strategy in progesterone-dependent breast cancer.
Exposure to nickel is a major cause of allergic contact dermatitis which is considered to be an inflammatory response induced by antigen-specific T cells. Here we describe the in vitro analysis of the nickel-specific T-cell-derived cytokine response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 35 nickel-allergic and 30 non-nickel-allergic individuals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with 10(-4) and 10(-5) mol/l NiSO4 for 6 days and then additionally with ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate for 24 h. Culture supernatants were analysed for interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by quantitative ELISA. The analysis showed that the synthesis of IL-4 and IL-5 but not of IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha was significantly higher in the nickel-allergic individuals. The finding of preferential synthesis of Th2 cytokines was somewhat of a surprise, since previous studies have suggested a Th1 response in nickel-mediated allergic contact dermatitis. Subsequently, the nickel-allergic individuals were randomized to experimental exposure to nickel or vehicle in a double-blind design. A daily 10-min exposure of one finger to 10 ppm nickel solution for 1 week followed by 100 ppm for an additional week evoked a clinical response of hand eczema in the nickel-exposed group. Blood samples were drawn on days 7 and 14 after the start of this exposure to occupationally relevant concentrations of nickel. No statistically significant differences were observed in the nickel-induced in vitro cytokine response during the exposure period. Our results indicate the possibility that IL-4 and IL-5 are involved in the pathogenesis of nickel-mediated contact dermatitis.
The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to determine if the addition of heparin and hydrocortisone, and the application of a topical glyceryl trinitrate patch over the catheter site (triple therapy) would results in a reduced incidence of thrombophlebitis during i.v. nutrition through a peripheral vein. Forty-six patients were randomized to receive either standard i.v. nutrition (i.v.N)(1200 mosm/kg) (control group, n = 23), or i.v.N plus triple therapy (study group, n = 23). The patient's arm was examined daily, and the catheter was removed if signs of thrombophlebitis were evident. The two groups were well matched in terms of age and gender, as well as indication for feeding and total days of i.v.N supplied. The catheters in the study group survived longer (p < .0001), and resulted in a lower incidence of thrombophlebitis (p < .05). The time of onset of thrombophlebitis was delayed in the study group (p < .0001). It is recommended that heparin, hydrocortisone, and a glyceryl trinitrate patch should be administered to all patients receiving i.v. nutrition via a fine-bore peripheral catheter.
No medication has received regulatory approval in the U.S.A. for the distressing agitation and aggressive behaviors that often complicate dementia. Although studies suggest that several psychotropic medications are sometimes useful for these behavioral problems, response is variable and adverse effects often limit treatment. Theoretical considerations suggest that increasing estrogenic activity or reducing androgenic activity could reduce agitation and aggression in dementia. Estrogen has been reported helpful for these symptoms, but adverse effects are problematic. Chronic administration of the synthetic gonadotropin (luteinising hormone) releasing hormone analogue, goserelin, reduces testosterone activity. Here we describe the apparently sustained elimination of previously treatment-resistant agitation and aggression with goserelin treatment in a 78-year-old male nursing-home resident with Alzheimer's disease.
