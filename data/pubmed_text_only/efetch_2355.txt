SPARC belongs to a class of extracellular matrix-associated proteins that have counteradhesive properties. The ability of SPARC to modulate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions provides a strong rationale for studies designed to determine its expression in cancer. The objective of this study was to determine if SPARC expression was altered in cadmium (Cd(2+)) and arsenite (As(3+)) induced bladder cancer and if these alterations were present in archival specimens of human bladder cancer. The expression of SPARC was determined in human parental UROtsa cells, their Cd(2+) and As(3+) transformed counterparts and derived tumors, and in archival specimens of human bladder cancer using a combination of real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunofluorescence localization and immunohistochemical staining. It was demonstrated that SPARC expression was down-regulated in Cd(2+) and As(3+) transformed UROtsa cells. In addition, the malignant epithelial component of tumors derived from these cell lines were also down-regulated for SPARC expression, but the stromal cells recruited to these tumors was highly reactive for SPARC. This finding was shown to translate to specimens of human bladder cancer where tumor cells were SPARC negative, but stromal cells were positive. Acute exposure of UROtsa cells to both cadmium and arsenite reduced the expression of SPARC through a mechanism that did not involve changes in DNA methylation or histone acetylation. These studies suggest that environmental exposure to As(3+) or Cd(2+) can alter cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in normal urothelial cells through a reduction in the expression of SPARC. The SPARC associated loss of cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts may participate in the multi-step process of bladder carcinogenesis.
Twenty-nine women in premature labor were randomly assigned to a ritodrine (N = 14) or placebo (N = 15) treatment group. Thirteen serial blood samples were drawn during the first 12 hours of therapy by intravenous drug infusion and they were analyzed for a variety of metabolic substances. There was a significant increase in the blood glucose level in the ritodrine group after one hour and this persisted for the 12 hours of intravenous drug treatment. Plasma insulin levels similarly did not increase in the placebo but significantly rose in the ritodrine group by 30 minutes, peaked at 2 1/2 hours, and remained elevated throughout the infusion. There were no significant differences between levels of plasma glucagon, cholesterol triglyceride, human placental lactogen, or human chorionic gonadotropin in the two treatment groups. Ritodrine caused significant maternal and fetal tachycardia. Its use in women with carbohydrate abnormalities should be monitored carefully. The increased glucose levels may lead to an increased fetal weight.
Between October 1998 and September 2000, 111 consecutive pregnant patients admitted to the Port Moresby General Hospital antenatal ward with a haemoglobin level of 6 g/dl or less were studied. The main causes of the severe anaemia were as follows: iron deficiency on its own or in combination with another factor 66%--iron deficiency on its own 43% and combined folate and iron deficiency 23%--and folate deficiency 18%. Malaria was a contributory factor in 13 patients (12%). A combination of blood film, bone marrow study, serum assays of ferritin, folate and vitamin B12, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was used to determine the cause of the anaemia. Ferritin levels on their own poorly correlated with the presence of iron in the bone marrow. A low MCV correlated well with iron deficiency anaemia while a high MCV was associated with folic acid deficiency. It would seem therefore that while a bone marrow study is mandatory to reach a definitive diagnosis of severe anaemia, MCV, in conjunction with the red cell morphology on blood film, would be a good marker for iron and folic acid deficiency anaemia, especially as we do not have serum assays readily available for folate, ferritin and vitamin B12 in Papua New Guinea.
Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is an ovotoxic constituent of cigarette smoke associated with pre-mature ovarian failure and decreased rates of conception in IVF patients. Although the overall effect of BaP on female fertility has been documented, the exact molecular mechanisms behind its ovotoxicity remain elusive. In this study we examined the effects of BaP exposure on the ovarian transcriptome, and observed the effects of in vivo exposure on oocyte dysfunction. Microarray analysis of BaP cultured neonatal ovaries revealed a complex mechanism of ovotoxicity involving a small cohort of genes associated with follicular growth, cell cycle progression, and cell death. Histomorphological and immunohistochemical analysis supported these results, with BaP exposure causing increased primordial follicle activation and developing follicle atresia in vitro and in vivo. Functional analysis of oocytes obtained from adult Swiss mice treated neonatally revealed significantly increased levels of mitochondrial ROS/lipid peroxidation, and severely reduced sperm-egg binding and fusion in both low (1.5mg/kg/daily) and high (3mg/kg/daily) dose treatments. Our results reveal a complex mechanism of BaP induced ovotoxicity involving developing follicle atresia and accelerated primordial follicle activation, and suggest short term neonatal BaP exposure causes mitochondrial leakage resulting in reduced oolemma fluidity and impaired fertilisation in adulthood. This study highlights BaP as a key compound which may be partially responsible for the documented effects of cigarette smoke on follicular development and sub-fertility.
Capgras syndrome in association with lithium toxicity is described in a 74-year-old woman. Lithium toxicity should be considered when new delusions occur during lithium therapy.
A 5-year-old girl with Ph-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation, developed two episodes of electrical status epilepticus while receiving tacrolimus (FK506) then cyclosporin A (CsA), as treatment against graft-versus-host disease. MRI including diffusion weighted MR imaging of the brain revealed abnormalities in the hippocampus and posterior white matter following FK506 and CsA treatment, respectively. While posterior white matter injury has been described with both FK506 and CsA, no previous report describes hippocampal injury from either drug. The MRI changes in the hippocampus in our case suggest possible increased susceptibility to hippocampal injury with FK506.
Numerous highly effective antiarrhythmic agents are now available which have a powerful anti-arrhythmia action but may cause severe side effects in the case of inappropriate use. We report the case of a patient with WPW syndrome in whom inappropriate administration of verapamil during an episode of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response caused ventricular fibrillation.
A 66-year-old woman showed profound neuropsychiatric disturbance after withdrawal from prolonged corticosteroid treatment. Reintroduction of an alternative corticosteroid, at low dose, produced a return to premorbid mental state.
A patient with chronic renal insufficiency undergoing dialysis treatment presented with a clinical picture of acute intrahepatic cholestasis and alterations in liver function indices. Liver biopsy showed a histological picture of hepatitis with cholestatic signs. A causal correlation with the recent administration of ticlopidine was hypothesized, which led to the drug being discontinued. Four months after drug withdrawal no improvement in the biochemical parameters had yet occurred and the patient's clinical conditions were indeed worsening so we proceeded with extracorporeal selective plasmapheresis treatments to reduce the bilirubin. As the cholestatic syndrome was unresolved and owing to the progressive worsening in the clinical picture, the patient was submitted to combined liver and kidney transplant followed by a rapid functional recovery in both organs. Regular monitoring of the hepatic function indices during the therapy with ticlopidine is therefore indispensable for the early detection of unpredictably severe hepatotoxicity.
Serum lipids and the cholesterol concentrations in the high density lipoprotein (HDL) fractions were measured in patients receiving long-term corticosteroid treatment for connective tissue disorders and asthma. Patients who were not receiving corticosteroid treatment had blood lipid levels which did not differ from those of healthy people. However, female (but not male) patients who had received prednisolone for a mean period of 3.1 years had a significant elevation in total cholesterol and a large decrease in HDL cholesterol. It seems possible that high levels of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of premenopausal ischaemic heart disease in females.
Disruption of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in mesangial cells is a pathogenic consequence of diabetic nephropathy. We examined the role of simvastatin (SIM) in modulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the apoptosis of high glucose (HG)-stressed mesangial cells in vitro and in vivo.
For in vitro studies, we cultured mesangial cells, with or without SIM pretreatment, in 35 mM glucose and then assayed Wnt activity and apoptosis. For in vivo studies, we administered SIM to streptozocin-induced diabetic rats for 28 days and then dissected renal tissues for immunohistological assessment of Wnt signal expression and apoptosis of glomerular cells.
SIM reduced the promotional effect of HG on caspase-3 expression, PARP activation, and cell apoptosis. HG significantly reduced Wnt4 and Wnt5a mRNA expression and SIM restored Wnt4 and Wnt5a mRNA expression to the level of controls. SIM also suppressed HG-mediated activation of GSK-3b and restored nuclear beta-catenin levels and phospho-Akt expression. This suggests that SIM alters the stability of beta-catenin, a critical element of mesangial cell survival. Exogenous SIM treatment blocked DNA fragmentation, increased the Wnt/beta-catenin immunoreactivities of cells adjacent to renal glomeruli, and attenuated urinary protein secretion in diabetic rats.
SIM reduces the detrimental effects of HG on diabetic renal glomeruli in vitro and in vivo. SIM prevents HG-induced downregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and thereby blocks mesangial cell apoptosis.
The possible role of alcohol in the development of hepatotoxicity associated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is currently debated.
We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of alcohol and who developed liver failure within 3-5 days after hospitalization and stopping alcohol consumption while being treated with 4 g paracetamol/day. A paracetamol serum level obtained in one of these patients was not in the toxic range. Possible risk factors for the development of hepatotoxicity in patients treated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol are discussed.
In patients with risk factors, e.g. regular consumption of alcohol, liver failure is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested. We propose that the paracetamol dose should not exceed 2 g/day in such patients and that their liver function should be monitored closely while being treated with paracetamol.
Primary care patients with a major depressive disorder and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (17-HAM-D) score >18 were randomized to 24 weeks of treatment with mirtazapine 30-45 mg/day (n=99) or paroxetine 20-30 mg/day (n=98). Both treatments were efficacious in improving depressive symptomatology, as assessed by group mean 17-HAM-D scores, percentages of HAM-D responders and remitters and Clinical Global Improvement responders. The mirtazapine group showed statistically significantly larger decreases from baseline in group mean 17-HAM-D scores at weeks 1, 2 and 4, and the difference with the paroxetine group reached the level of clinical relevance at weeks 2 and 4. Antidepressant efficacy was maintained throughout both the acute and continuation phase of treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated. The only adverse event with a statistically significantly higher incidence in the mirtazapine group was fatigue. Statistically significantly more paroxetine-treated patients complained of increased sweating, headache and nausea. The results demonstrate that both mirtazapine and paroxetine were efficacious and well tolerated when used for 24 weeks in depressed patients treated in primary care. An observed difference in efficacy favouring mirtazapine between weeks 1 and 4 indicates that mirtazapine patients had improved earlier compared to those on paroxetine, and corroborates similar findings in other comparisons of mirtazapine versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
Oral administration of p,p'-1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), a chemical believed to increase neuronal membrane excitability increased the acoustic startle responsiveness of rats. Inhibition of the acoustic startle response with a brief, prepulse white-noise stimulus was evident at 12.5 to 25 mg/kg of p,p'-DDT, but not at 50 mg/kg. Pretreatment of rats with phenoxybenzamine, an adrenergic receptor antagonist, attenuated the effects of 12.5 mg/kg of p,p'-DDT on the acoustic startle reflex, and decreased the maximum magnitude reduction produced by the prepulse stimulus in DDT-exposed rats. These data extend previous work showing that p,p'-DDT augments startle reactivity in rats and is in accord with the existence of an excitatory norepinephrine(NE)-containing pathway modulating motor outflow in the acoustic startle reflex arc.
Although mutation of APC or CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) is rare in breast cancer, activation of Wnt signalling is nonetheless thought to play an important role in breast tumorigenesis, and epigenetic silencing of Wnt antagonist genes, including the secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP) and Dickkopf (DKK) families, has been observed in various tumours. In breast cancer, frequent methylation and silencing of SFRP1 was recently documented; however, altered expression of other Wnt antagonist genes is largely unknown. In the present study, we found frequent methylation of SFRP family genes in breast cancer cell lines (SFRP1, 7 out of 11, 64%; SFRP2, 11 out of 11, 100%; SFRP5, 10 out of 11, 91%) and primary breast tumours (SFRP1, 31 out of 78, 40%; SFRP2, 60 out of 78, 77%; SFRP5, 55 out of 78, 71%). We also observed methylation of DKK1, although less frequently, in cell lines (3 out of 11, 27%) and primary tumours (15 out of 78, 19%). Breast cancer cell lines express various Wnt ligands, and overexpression of SFRPs inhibited cancer cell growth. In addition, overexpression of a beta-catenin mutant and depletion of SFRP1 using small interfering RNA synergistically upregulated transcriptional activity of T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor. Our results confirm the frequent methylation and silencing of Wnt antagonist genes in breast cancer, and suggest that their loss of function contributes to activation of Wnt signalling in breast carcinogenesis.
To perform a meta analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials evaluating the use of dopamine agonist (DA) or placebo to preexisting levodopa therapy for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). We focused on clinically important efficacy [Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) activities of daily living (ADL) and motor scores as well as change in 'off' time and levodopa dose] and safety outcomes (withdrawal because of adverse drug events (ADEs), dyskinesias, hallucinations and mortality).
A systematic literature search was performed between January 1990 and July 2007. The primary outcome measures assessed were the reduction in scores of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) activities of daily living (ADL) and motor scores as well as reduction in 'off' time and reductions in levodopa dose from baseline. Safety end-points were also evaluated.
A total of 15 trials (n = 4380 subjects) were included in the meta analysis. Adjunctive DA use resulted in greater improvement as measured by the UPDRS ADL [weighted mean difference (WMD) -2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.64 to -1.76; p < 0.0001] and motor score reduction (WMD -5.56, 95% CI -6.82 to -4.31; p < 0.0001) as well as reduction in 'off' time measured in hours/day (WMD -1.20, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.62; p < 0.0001) and reduction in levodopa dose (WMD -128.5 mg, 95% CI -175.0 to -82.1; p < 0.0001) vs. placebo. Incidence of dyskinesia and hallucinations was higher with DAs [odds ratio (OR) 3.27, 95% CI 2.65-4.03; p < 0.0001] and (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.44-4.58; p < 0.0001). Non-ergot DAs were qualitatively better, although both ergot and non-ergot DAs showed statistically significant improvements in all UPDRS scores.
Adjunctive DA use to levodopa is superior to levodopa alone in reducing PD symptoms in patients not controlled with monotherapy. DAs seem especially useful amongst PD patients with wearing-off phenomenon from levodopa therapy, but can cause some adverse events.
We assessed the analgesic efficacy and safety of single-entity oxycodone solution at doses greater than 10 mg orally every 4 hours in 24 patients with chronic cancer pain not controlled by weaker analgesics.
Twenty of 24 patients completed the study. Pain relief was obtained with doses up to 60 mg every 4 hours. When oxycodone was taken for long periods, further dose increments could be made safely. The side effects of oxycodone are mild, and common to all opioids, with sedation and constipation most frequent. Nausea was more common in females in all age groups and in patients of either sex less than 50 years of age. Episodes of serious toxicity were rare, and responded to dose reduction. Patients older than 65 years required lower doses, suggesting pharmacokinetic similarities between oxycodone and morphine. Patients changed from oral oxycodone to morphine remained pain-free when relative milligram potency ratios of 1:1 to oral morphine and 3:1 to intravenous morphine were used.
Oxycodone has been shown for the first time to be as versatile and flexible as oral morphine in the management of chronic pain in patients with advanced cancer.
We describe a 64-year-old woman with biphenotypic leukemia involving the meninges who received 2 doses of intrathecal methotrexate. Soon after treatment, the patient developed postural rigidity and a marked decline in mental status. The patient died of respiratory failure 1 month after methotrexate treatment was initiated. At autopsy, the brain was grossly normal. Routine microscopy showed no evidence of leukemic infiltrates or necrotizing lesions. However, when stained with beta-amyloid precursor protein, multifocal axonal injury was evident in the brain, spinal cord, and nerve roots. Our findings show that immunohistochemical staining for beta-amyloid precursor protein can effectively demonstrate axonal injury associated with methotrexate neurotoxicity, even when conventional staining procedures are negative. This technique may therefore reveal a possible pathologic substrate for some of the neurological complications seen in patients with methotrexate neurotoxicity.
We compare the efficacy, adverse events, and recovery duration of etomidate and propofol for use in procedural sedation in the emergency department (ED).
This was a randomized nonblinded prospective trial of adult patients undergoing procedural sedation for painful procedures in the ED. Patients received either propofol or etomidate. Doses, vital signs, nasal end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), pulse oximetry, and bispectral electroencephalogram analysis scores were recorded. Subclinical respiratory depression was defined as a change in ETCO2 greater than 10 mm Hg, an oxygen saturation of less than 92% at any time, or an absent ETCO2 waveform at any time. Clinical events related to respiratory depression, including an increase in supplemental oxygen, the use of a bag-valve-mask apparatus, airway repositioning, or stimulation to induce breathing, were noted during the procedure. After the procedure, patients completed visual analog scales about perceived pain during the procedure and recall of the procedure.
Two hundred twenty patients were enrolled; 214 underwent sedation and were analyzed. One hundred five patients received etomidate and 109 received propofol. No clinically significant complications were noted. Subclinical respiratory depression was observed in 36 of 105 (34.3%) patients in the etomidate group and 46 of 109 (42.2%) in the propofol group (difference -7.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -20.9% to 5.1%). Myoclonus was noted in 21 of 105 (20.0%) patients in the etomidate group and 2 of 109 (1.8%) in the propofol group (difference 18.2%; 95% CI 10.1% to 26.2%). The mean difference between baseline systolic blood pressure and the nadir was 3.8% (95% CI 2.3% to 5.3%) for etomidate and 7.9% (95% CI 6.1% to 9.7%) for propofol. Clinical events related to respiratory depression included an increase in supplemental oxygen in 6.7% of etomidate patients and 5.5% of propofol patients (difference 1.2%; 95% CI -5.2% to 7.6%), the use of bag-valve-mask apparatus in 3.8% of patients in the etomidate groups and 4.6% in the propofol group (difference -0.8%; 95% CI -6.1% to 4.6%), airway repositioning in 13.3% of etomidate patients and 11.0% of propofol patients (effect size 2.3%; 95% CI -6.4% to 11.1%), and stimulation to induce breathing in 11.4% of etomidate patients and 11.9% of propofol patients (difference -0.5%; 95% CI -9.1% to 8.1%). The procedures were successful in 93 of 105 (88.6%) for etomidate and 106 of 109 (97.2%) for propofol (difference -7.4%; 95% CI -14.3% to -1.1%).
Etomidate and propofol appear equally safe for ED procedural sedation; however, etomidate had a lower rate of procedural success and induced myoclonus in 20% of patients.
Muramyldipeptide (MDP), the minimum essential structure responsible for the immuno-adjuvant activity of peptidoglycan, is recognized by intracellular nuclear-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2). Muramyldipeptide enhances the activities of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but the mechanism underlying this effect is unclear. Here, we obtained evidence that intravenously injected MDP augments LPS-induced hypothermia in wild-type mice, but not in mice deficient in interleukin (IL)-1α/β and/or tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Muramyldipeptide also: (i) increased pro-IL-1β in tissues, but did not increase IL-1β in serum (since caspase-1 was not activated by MDP); (ii) downregulated the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1; a negative-feedback regulator of LPS-induced signaling); and (iii) augmented the LPS-induced production of TNF-α, IL-12 p40, and interferon (IFN)-γ. Moreover, by performing in vivo and in vitro experiments, we obtained evidence that macrophages were involved in these effects of MDP. These results suggest that two different mechanisms may underlie the augmenting effect of MDP: namely, stimulation of pro-IL-1β production by, and down-regulation of SOCS1 in, macrophages. We consider that this work may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of mixed bacterial infections, including septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
The carcinogenicity of dichloromethane (DCM) has been demonstrated by mutagenicity studies using bacteria and yeasts and using animal bioassays. Epidemiological studies indicate that exposure to DCM increases the incidences of liver and pancreas cancers. In the present study, we determine whether DCM generates DNA damage in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and whether that process depends on glutathione S-transferase theta (GSTT)-1 activity. GSTT1 is one of the enzymes that biotransforms DCM. To this end, PBMC cultures from healthy men were treated with DCM (15-500 ppm) for 72 h. Cell cultures were harvested and processed according to classical cytogenetic techniques. The frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), the mitotic index (MI), the cell proliferation kinetic (CPK) value, and the level of GSTT1 activity were determined. DCM exposure decreased the MI in a dose-dependent manner in all individuals tested (20). The CPK value decreased from 125 ppm DCM, and the SCEs frequency increased from 60 ppm DCM. A significantly different response was observed when the group of individuals with low GSTT1 enzymatic activity (4 individuals), the group with medium GSTT1 activity (10 individuals), and the group of individuals with high GSTT1 enzymatic activity (6 individuals) were compared (0.077 ± 0.0124, 0.325 ± 0.0269, and 7.365 ± 1.3474 nmol HCOH/min/mg protein, respectively). These differences were reflected in the amount of change for all of the evaluated cytogenetic parameters (p<0.05, ANOVA) and indicated a clear susceptibility to DCM genotoxic effects related to GSTT1 activity because the cytogenetic effects were directly related to the GSTT1-specific activity. DCM was highly cytotoxic in PBMCs, even at doses within the safety range. Due to this toxicity, a review of the maximal limits for occupational exposure to DCM is advised.
Sensory neuropathy is a common adverse effect of the nucleoside analogue anti-retroviral drugs didanosine (ddl) and stauvudine (d4T). These drugs are increasingly being used in combination, and it is not currently known whether the incidence of neuropathy is higher with combination compared to individual drug use. It is also not known if hydroxyurea, used to potentiate the antiviral efficacy of these drugs, may also increase the risk of neuropathy. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate if the combination of ddl and d4T, with or without hydroxyurea, has a higher incidence of neuropathy than a single drug regimen.
Data were obtained from patients followed longitudinally by the Johns Hopkins AIDS Services. Incidence rates of development of neuropathy were calculated for each of five regimens: ddl (+/- hydroxyurea), ddl + d4T (+/- hydroxyurea), and d4T. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to compare the relative risk of neuropathy for each regimen adjusting for CD4 cell count, other drugs received, and time on therapy.
A total of 1116 patients received at least one of the five regimens. There were 117 cases of neuropathy. The crude incidence rate of neuropathy ranged from 6.8 cases per 100 person-years for ddl to 28.6 cases per 100 person-years for ddl + d4T + hydroxyurea. Compared with ddl alone, and adjusting for CD4 cell counts and other variables, the relative risk of neuropathy was 1.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-2.32] for d4T alone, 2.35 (95% CI: 0.69-8.07) for ddl + hydroxyurea, 3.50 (95% CI: 1.81-6.77) for ddl + d4T, and 7.80 (95% CI: 3.92-15.5) for ddl + d4T + hydroxyurea.
Based on the data, the risk of neuropathy is additive or even synergistic for ddl + d4T + hydroxyurea compared with ddl or d4T alone. The combination of ddl + d4T also increases the risk of neuropathy but less than when hydroxyurea is included.
A recent and surprising body of research has linked changes in immune function to biologic and therapeutic targeting of cannabinoid receptors, which prototypically respond to delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol. The peripheral cannabinoid receptor CB2 is highly expressed in immune cell types (macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells), and pharmacologically alters their cytokine production and responsiveness. Accordingly, cannabinoid agonists can powerfully alter susceptibility to certain microbial infections, atherosclerosis, and cancer immunotherapy. What is unknown is the physiologic role of natural levels of endocannabinoids and their receptors in normal immune homeostasis. Galphai2-/- mice are deficient in the formation of certain B and T cell subsets and are susceptible to immune dysregulation, notably developing inflammatory bowel disease. A key issue is the identity of the Gi-coupled receptors relevant to this Galphai2-signaling pathway. We find that mice deficient in CB2, the Gi-coupled peripheral endocannabinoid receptor, have profound deficiencies in splenic marginal zone, peritoneal B1a cells, splenic memory CD4+ T cells, and intestinal natural killer cells and natural killer T cells. These findings partially phenocopy and extend the lymphocyte developmental disorder associated with the Galphai2-/- genotype, and suggest that the endocannabinoid system is required for the formation of T and B cell subsets involved in immune homeostasis. This noncompensatable requirement for physiologic function of the endocannabinoid system is novel. Because levels of endocannabinoids are highly restricted microanatomically, local regulation of their production and receptor expression offers a new principle for regional immune homeostasis and disease susceptibility, and extends and refines the rationale for CB2-targeted immunotherapy in immune and inflammatory diseases.
Salicylate, a common drug frequently used long term in the clinic, is well known for causing reversible hearing loss and tinnitus. Our previous study, however, demonstrated that chronic administration of salicylate progressively raised the amplitude of distortion product of otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), which are mainly caused by (outer hair cell) OHC electromotility. How salicylate affects OHC electromotility to cause this paradoxical increase remains unclear. One possibility is that it could affect prestin, which is a motor protein that contributes to the mechano-electrical properties of OHCs. In this experiment, we assessed the effect of acute and chronic salicylate treatment on prestin expression. Interestingly, after long-term salicylate injection (200 mg/kg, twice daily for 14 days), prestin gene and protein levels were up-regulated about twofold. These levels returned to baseline 14 days after treatment stopped. Acute injection of salicylate (single injection, 400 mg/kg) did not affect prestin levels. These data reveal that chronic salicylate administration markedly, but reversibly, increased prestin levels which may contribute to the enhanced DPOAE amplitudes we observed previously with similar salicylate treatment, which may be responsible for salicylate-induced tinnitus generation.
