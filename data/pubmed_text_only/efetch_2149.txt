Prolactin (PRL), a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, has multiple physiological functions, including immunoregulation. PRL can also be secreted in response to stressful stimuli. During stress, PRL has been suggested to oppose the immunosuppressive effects of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of short- and long-term hyperprolactinemia on the inflammatory response in rats subjected to acute or chronic cold stress.
Inflammatory edema was induced by carrageenan in male rats, and hyperprolactinemia was induced by injections of the dopamine receptor antagonist domperidone. The volume of inflammatory edema was measured by plethysmography after carrageenan injection. Additionally, the effects of hyperprolactinemia on body weight and serum corticosterone levels were evaluated.
Five days of domperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia increased the volume of inflammatory edema. No differences in serum corticosterone levels were observed between groups. No significant differences were found among 30 days domperidone-induced hyperprolactinemic animals subjected to acute stress and the inflammatory response observed in chronic hyperprolactinemic animals subjected to chronic stress. The results suggest that short-term hyperprolactinemia has pro-inflammatory effects. Because such an effect was not observed in long-term hyperprolactinemic animals, PRL-induced tolerance seems likely. We suggest that short-term hyperprolactinemia may act as a protective factor in rats subjected to acute stress. These data suggest that hyperprolactinemia and stress interact differentially according to the time period.
Topical application of 3% papaverine hydrochloride in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) produces reversible conduction block of the facial nerve.
A case of loss of spontaneous and evoked facial muscle activity, and transient postoperative facial paralysis, after topical application of papaverine in the CPA during surgery for an acoustic neuroma using intraoperative cranial nerve monitoring is reported. Other cases of transient neurologic dysfunction after use of this drug have been reported.
A rabbit model of CPA surgery via suboccipital craniectomy, with intraoperative monitoring of the facial nerve, was used in this experiment.
No significant difference in facial muscle stimulation thresholds was identified after application of varying concentrations of papaverine to the facial nerve in the CPA.
Although the intraoperative event described in the report is suggestive of an effect of papaverine on facial nerve function, this effect could not be reproduced in an established animal model of CPA surgery.
We have described the case of a patient who had symptoms of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome after treatment with carbamazepine. The symptoms resolved after carbamazepine therapy was stopped, which suggests carbamazepine as their cause.
We have described the case of a 58-year-old woman in whom acute hemolytic anemia, renal failure, and granulocytopenia developed after intake of mefenamic acid and diclofenac. Results of direct and indirect Coombs' tests were negative, but the lymphocyte transformation test was positive for these two nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We suggest that the immune complex mechanism could have induced these adverse reactions. Although these drugs are very popular, simultaneous administration should be avoided because serious adverse effects can potentially occur.
A temporal relationship has been established between cocaine ingestion and myocardial infarction, and a cocaine-induced increase in platelet aggregation has been suggested as a possible explanation. However, the mechanisms of cocaine associated coronary thrombosis have yet to be completely elucidated. For this reason, we examined the in vitro effect of cocaine and its metabolites on platelet aggregation.
Platelet aggregation was tested by obtaining platelet rich plasma from 42 healthy volunteers and incubating the platelet rich plasma in six concentrations of cocaine (ranging from 1.47 to 2940 nmol) for 10 minutes prior to aggregation with ADP 1 microM. The same procedure was used to test the effect of two cocaine metabolites, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester, on platelet aggregation. Abnormal results were confirmed by inducing aggregation with ADP at higher concentrations (2.4 and 10 microM) and with arachidonic acid (624 microM).
At increasing concentrations, cocaine progressively inhibited ADP and arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation. No effect was seen with benzoyl ecgonine or ecgonine methyl ester as compared to saline.
These data suggest that under certain conditions cocaine may negatively affect hemostasis by decreasing platelet aggregation.
Previous studies have shown that untreated patients with acute schizophrenia present with reduced heart rate variability and complexity as well as increased QT variability. This autonomic dysregulation might contribute to increased cardiac morbidity and mortality in these patients. However, the additional effects of newer antipsychotics on autonomic dysfunction have not been investigated, applying these new cardiac parameters to gain information about the regulation at sinus node level as well as the susceptibility to arrhythmias. We have investigated 15 patients with acute schizophrenia before and after established olanzapine treatment and compared them with matched controls. New nonlinear parameters (approximate entropy, compression entropy, fractal dimension) of heart rate variability and also the QT-variability index were calculated. In accordance with previous results, we have observed reduced complexity of heart rate regulation in untreated patients. Furthermore, the QT-variability index was significantly increased in unmedicated patients, indicating increased repolarization lability. Reduction of the heart rate regulation complexity after olanzapine treatment was seen, as measured by compression entropy of heart rate. No change in QT variability was observed after treatment. This study shows that unmedicated patients with acute schizophrenia experience autonomic dysfunction. Olanzapine treatment seems to have very little additional impact in regard to the QT variability. However, the decrease in heart rate complexity after olanzapine treatment suggests decreased cardiac vagal function, which may increase the risk for cardiac mortality. Further studies are warranted to gain more insight into cardiac regulation in schizophrenia and the effect of novel antipsychotics.
Insulin resistance is a major pathological condition associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance and the renin-angiotensin system are intimately linked. We evaluated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance-associated, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by using the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker olmesartan medoxomil in a diabetic rat model. The effects of olmesartan on methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced steatohepatitis were investigated in obese, diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats and control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats. Components of the renin-angiotensin system were up-regulated in the livers of OLETF rats, compared with LETO rats. In OLETF, but not LETO, rats, oral administration of olmesartan for 8 weeks ameliorated insulin resistance. Moreover, olmesartan suppressed MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis and the hepatic expression of lipogenic genes (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and fatty acid synthase) in OLETF, but not LETO, rats. In both OLETF and LETO rats, olmesartan inhibited hepatic oxidative stress (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified protein) and expression of NADPH oxidase. Olmesartan also inhibited hepatic fibrosis, stellate cell activation, and expression of fibrogenic genes (transforming growth factor-beta, alpha 1 [I] procollagen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) in both OLETF and LETO rats. In conclusion, pharmacological blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor slows the development of steatohepatitis in the OLETF rat model. This angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker may exert insulin resistance-associated effects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation as well as direct effects against the generation of reactive oxygen species and fibrogenesis.
To determine the prevalence of cognitive delay and possible associated dysmorphic features in children exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in utero.
Retrospective study of children born to mothers with epilepsy.
Regional epilepsy clinics in Liverpool and Manchester, UK.
Children aged between 6 months and 16 years born to mothers with epilepsy.
Structured interviews, hospital records, clinical examination, and psychometric tests (Wechsler) were used to assess exposure and intelligence quotient (IQ). Blinded assessment of photographs was used to score children with characteristic dysmorphic features.
A total of 249 children aged 6 and over were studied: 41 were exposed to sodium valproate, 52 to carbamazepine, 21 to phenytoin, 49 to polytherapy, and 80 were unexposed. Mean verbal IQ was significantly lower in the valproate group compared to unexposed and other monotherapy groups. Multiple regression analysis showed that both valproate exposure and frequent tonic-clonic seizures in pregnancy were significantly associated with a lower verbal IQ despite adjusting for other confounding factors. There was a significant negative correlation between dysmorphic features and verbal IQ in children exposed to valproate.
This study identifies valproate as a drug carrying potential risks for developmental delay and cognitive impairment and is the first to suggest that frequent tonic-clonic seizures have a similar effect. Our results need to be interpreted with caution given their retrospective nature. Women with epilepsy need careful counselling about individual risk benefit of AED treatment before pregnancy.
Transplacental inorganic arsenic carcinogenicity, together with postnatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol or tamoxifen, was studied. Pregnant CD1 mice received 85 ppm arsenic in the drinking water from gestation days 8 to 18 and were allowed to give birth. Groups (n = 35) of female offspring were injected s.c. on postpartum days 1 through 5 with diethylstilbestrol (2 microg/pup/d) or tamoxifen (10 microg/pup/d) and observed for 90 weeks. Arsenic alone induced some urogenital system tumors, including mostly benign tumors of the ovary and uterus, and adrenal adenoma. Diethylstilbestrol alone induced some tumors (primarily cervical) but when given after in utero arsenic, it greatly enhanced urogenital tumor incidence, multiplicity, and progression. For instance, compared with the incidence of urogenital malignancies in the control (0%), arsenic alone (9%), and diethylstilbestrol alone (21%) groups, arsenic plus diethylstilbestrol acted synergistically, inducing a 48% incidence of malignant urogenital tumors. Of the urogenital tumors induced by arsenic plus diethylstilbestrol, 80% were malignant, and 55% were multiple site. Arsenic plus diethylstilbestrol increased ovarian, uterine, and vaginal tumors, and urinary bladder proliferative lesions, including three transitional cell carcinomas. Tamoxifen alone did not increase urogenital tumors or affect arsenic-induced neoplasia but did increase arsenic-induced uroepithelial proliferative lesions. Uterine and bladder carcinoma induced by arsenic plus diethylstilbestrol greatly overexpressed estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) and pS2, an estrogen-regulated gene. In neonatal uteri, prenatal arsenic increased ER-alpha expression and enhanced estrogen-related gene expression induced by postnatal diethylstilbestrol. Thus, arsenic acts with estrogens to enhance production of female mouse urogenital cancers.
Oxidative stress has been proposed as an important promoter of the progression of fatty liver diseases. The current study investigates the potential functions of the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway, an important hepatic oxidative stress sensor, in a rodent fatty liver model. Mice with no (Nrf2-null), normal (wild type, WT), and enhanced (Keap1 knockdown, K1-kd) expression of Nrf2 were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet or a control diet for 5 days. Compared to WT mice, the MCD diet-caused hepatosteatosis was more severe in the Nrf2-null mice and less in the K1-kd mice. The Nrf2-null mice had lower hepatic glutathione and exhibited more lipid peroxidation, whereas the K1-kd mice had the highest amount of glutathione in the liver and developed the least lipid peroxidation among the three genotypes fed the MCD diet. The Nrf2 signaling pathway was activated by the MCD diet, and the Nrf2-targeted cytoprotective genes Nqo1 and Gstalpha1/2 were induced in WT and even more in K1-kd mice. In addition, Nrf2-null mice on both control and MCD diets exhibited altered expression profiles of fatty acid metabolism genes, indicating Nrf2 may influence lipid metabolism in liver. For example, mRNA levels of long chain fatty acid translocase CD36 and the endocrine hormone Fgf21 were higher in livers of Nrf2-null mice and lower in the K1-kd mice than WT mice fed the MCD diet. Taken together, these observations indicate that Nrf2 could decelerate the onset of fatty livers caused by the MCD diet by increasing hepatic antioxidant and detoxification capabilities.
From 1986 to 1998, 29 cancer patients who had 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were identified. None of the patients had decompensated liver disease. Onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy varied from 0.5 to 5 days (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.3 days) after the initiation of chemotherapy. Plasma ammonium level ranged from 248 to 2387 microg% (mean: 626 +/- 431 microg%). Among the 32 episodes, 26 (81%) had various degrees of azotemia, 18 (56%) occurred during bacterial infections and 14 (44%) without infection occurred during periods of dehydration. Higher plasma ammonium levels and more rapid onset of hyperammonemia were seen in 18 patients with bacterial infections (p=0.003 and 0.0006, respectively) and in nine patients receiving high daily doses (2600 or 1800 mg/m2) of 5-FU (p=0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively). In 25 out of 32 episodes (78%), plasma ammonium levels and mental status returned to normal within 2 days after adequate management. In conclusion, hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU. Azotemia, body fluid insufficiency and bacterial infections were frequently found in these patients. It is therefore important to recognize this condition in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU.
Prostate cancer is a disease involving complicated multiple-gene alterations. Both NKX3.1 and p53 are related to prostate cancer and play crucial roles in prostate cancer progression. However, little is known about the relationships and interactions between p53 and NKX3.1 in prostate cancer. We found that NKX3.1 expression is down-regulated by over-expression of wild type (wt) p53 in prostate cancer LNCaP cells. NKX3.1 is down-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels by p53 over- expression due to either transient transfection of exogenous p53 or induction of endogenous p53. p53 over-expression represses androgen-induced transactivation of NKX3.1 by inhibiting the promoter of the androgen acceptor (AR) gene and by blocking AR-DNA binding activity. In addition, transfection with the p21 expression vector (pPSA-p21) showed that p21 does not reduce NKX3.1 expression, indicating that NKX3.1 expression is not the result of nonspecific effects of cell growth arrest. Our results provide biochemical and cellular biologic evidence that NKX3.1 is down-regulated by p53 over-expression in prostate cancer cells.
Effect of feeding safflower oil and coconut oil in experimental myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol in rats was studied. Based on the survival rate and histopathological examination, safflower oil was found to offer better protection than coconut oil. Serum GOT levels also confirmed the protective activity of safflower oil. The concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides in the heart and aorta were lower in the safflower oil fed group, while the level of phospholipids was higher.
Anastrozole is a selective aromatase inhibitor and is used for the hormonal treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer. There are major side effects of anastrozole including decrease in both lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density, increase in the incidence of all bone fractures (especially fractures of spine, hip and wrist), joint disorders and increase in the cholesterol level.
We report a case of a 73-year-old postmenopausal woman with stage T2N0M0 breast cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy was not indicated and anastrozole hormonotherapy was started. Diagnosis of sclerosing glomerulonephritis occurred in this patient during anastrozole use, suggesting a newly defined side effect of anastrozole.
Renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for anastrozole, clearance of anastrozole is unchanged even in severe renal impairment. Dosing adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary for anastrozole. We believe that the acute renal failure in our patient was associated with anastrozole. Renal injury due to anastrozole has not been published in the English literature.
Anastrozole may be the causative factor in patients with sclerosing glomerulonephritis.
The electrophysiological effects of alpha-chloralose anesthesia were determined in 13 chronically instrumented dogs and compared to baseline electrophysiological parameters in the conscious state. Alpha-chloralose anesthesia (75 mg/kg of a 4% solution in polyethylene glycol (PEG) delayed conduction and prolonged refractoriness of the AV node: (1) the P-R interval increased from 108 +/- 14 msec (mean +/- SD) in the conscious state to 125 +/- 23 msec (P less than 0.02); (2) the A-H from 98 +/- 12 msec to 108 +/- 16 msec (P less than 0.04); (3) the AV nodal effective refractory period from 136 +/- 16 to 153 +/- 29 msec (P = .05) and the AV nodal functional refractory period from 232 +/- 58 to 247 +/- 46 msec (P = 0.07); and (4) the AV block cycle length from 228 +/- 54 msec to 248 +/- 43 msec (P less than 0.04). Chloralose anesthesia also increased the ventricular refractory period from 139 +/- 13 msec to 161 +/- 22 msec (P less than .03) and the QTc interval from 273 +/- 22 to 306 +/- 32 msec (P less than 0.0002). To determine whether these effects on AV nodal conduction would influence experimental results, responses to verapamil were studied in the conscious state and during chloralose anesthesia. During chloralose anesthesia, (1) no relationship was detected between the sinus cycle length and verapamil concentrations; (2) a greater increment in AV conduction time was seen for a given verapamil concentration; and (3) AV block occurred at verapamil concentrations associated with 1:1 conduction in the conscious state. We conclude that chloralose anesthesia has significant electrophysiological effects and that these effects must be taken into consideration during the interpretation of experiments performed in animals during chloralose anesthesia.
Withdrawal symptoms have been linked to a propensity for relapse to drug abuse. Inasmuch as this association applies to methamphetamine (MA) abuse, an understanding of the course of MA withdrawal symptoms may help to direct treatment for MA dependence. Previous studies of symptoms manifested during abstinence from MA have been limited in size and scope. We asked (i) whether debilitating psychological and/or physical symptoms appear during the first several weeks of MA abstinence, (ii) how craving for MA evolves and (iii) whether psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression, psychosis) persist beyond a month of abstinence.
A study of MA-dependent participants, who initiated and maintained abstinence from the drug for up to 5 weeks, compared to a matched healthy comparison group.
In-patient research hospital ward (MA-dependent subjects) and out-patient (comparison subjects).
Fifty-six MA-dependent and eighty-nine comparison subjects.
Rater-assessed MA withdrawal questionnaire and self-report assessment of craving (MA-dependent subjects) and self-report assessment of psychiatric symptoms (both groups).
At study entry, MA-dependent subjects exhibited a wide range in severity of depressive symptoms, with the average score at a mild-moderate level of severity. Symptoms of psychosis were also prevalent. While depressive and psychotic symptoms largely resolved within a week of abstinence, craving did not decrease significantly from the time of initiating abstinence until the second week, and then continued at a reduced level to the fifth week.
Depressive and psychotic symptoms accompany acute withdrawal from methamphetamine but resolve within 1 week. Craving is also present and lasts at least 5 weeks.
The objective of this study was to determine whether HER-2 overexpression is associated with improved response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (FAC) in patients with breast carcinoma.
Ninety-seven patients with Stage I-III breast carcinoma were included. HER-2 expression was determined by routine clinical laboratory assessment, and tumors with 3 + immunohistochemistry staining intensity or gene amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization were considered HER-2 positive. Response was assessed by physical examination, imaging assessment, and pathologic assessment at the time of surgery.
The median patient age was 45 years. At baseline, 68% of patients had lymph node positive disease, 87% had >/= T2 tumors, and 28% of patients had HER-2 positive tumors. Eighty-four percent of patients received four courses of FAC, 8% of patients received 3 courses of FAC, and the remaining 8% of patients received 5-6 courses of FAC. The clinical response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) was 78%, the imaging response rate (CR and PR) was 64%, and 15% of patients had a good pathologic response, defined as a CR or minimal residual disease (tumor measuring < 1 cm in greatest dimension and negative lymph nodes). Concordance between the three methods of response assessment (clinical, pathologic, and imaging) was modest and was best between clinical assessment and imaging assessment (64% concordance). HER-2 status did not correlate with pathologic or clinical response (assessed by physical examination or imaging), although a nonsignificant trend was noted toward better response in patients with breast tumors that overexpressed HER-2.
The authors found no significant correlation between HER-2 expression and clinical or pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast carcinoma.
Administration of antimuscarinic drugs induces amnesia of aversively motivated behaviors. However, when relatively high intensities of footshock are used during training (over-reinforcement), animals become protected against such amnesic state. Moreover, the protective effect is established in a none-or-all fashion, i.e., within a series of increasing intensities a minute augmentation of footshock intensity is sufficient to reach the protective threshold. In the present experiment it was found that very low intensities of aversive stimulation (under-reinforcement), sufficient to produce learning, also protected animals from scopolamine-induced amnesia. These results suggest that acetylcholine is critically involved in memory consolidation of passive avoidance, but only within a limited range of training intensities.
We report a 49-year-old female patient with secondary myelodysplastic syndrome who developed liver dysfunction and acute renal failure caused by low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) therapy. Treatment of low-dose Ara-C has widely been used for acute myelogeous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, and it is thought to be a low toxicity except for myelosuppression. The patient complained of a transient adverse reaction in the second and third course of therapy. This rare case indicates that careful observation should be carried out during low-dose Ara-C therapy in view of allergic reactions.
An episode of subacute encephalopathy after the infusion of a moderate dose of methotrexate (1500 mg/m2) (MTX) is reported in a young adult with metastastic gastric cancer. Weakness of the right arm, focal seizures, lethargy and confusion appeared on day 10. High signal intensity in periventricular white matter was observed on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Symptoms resolved spontaneously and completely after 48 h. We believe that this represents an unusual case of moderate-dose MTX-induced neurotoxicity in a patient with gastric cancer, which has not previously been reported.
Deletions and mutations in the NSD1 gene are the major cause of Sotos syndrome. We wanted to evaluate the genotype-phenotype correlation in patients suspected of having Sotos syndrome and determine the best discriminating parameters for the presence of a NSD1 gene alteration.
Mutation and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed on blood samples of 59 patients who were clinically scored into 3 groups. Clinical data were compared between patients with and without NSD1 alterations. With logistic regression analysis the best combination of predictive variables was obtained.
In the groups of typical, dubious and atypical Sotos syndrome, 81, 36 and 0% of the patients, respectively, showed NSD1 gene alterations. Four deletions were detected. In 23 patients (2 families) 19 mutations were detected (1 splicing defect, 3 non-sense, 7 frameshift and 8 missense mutations). The best predictive parameters for a NSD1 gene alteration were frontal bossing, down-slanted palpebral fissures, pointed chin and overgrowth. Higher incidences of feeding problems and cardiac anomalies were found. The parameters, delayed development and advanced bone age, did not differ between the 2 subgroups.
In our patients suspected of having Sotos syndrome, facial features and overgrowth were highly predictive of a NSD1 gene aberration, whereas developmental delay and advanced bone age were not.
