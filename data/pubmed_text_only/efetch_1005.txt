Palate development depends on complex events and is very sensitive to disruption. Accordingly, clefts are the most common congenital malformations worldwide, and a connection is proposed with fetal exposure to toxic factors or environmental contaminants, such as dioxins. There is increasing evidence that dioxin interferes with all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), a hormone-like signal derived from vitamin A, which plays an essential role during embryonic development. Although similarities have been described between dioxin-induced toxicity and the outcome of altered atRA signaling during palate development, their relationship needs to be clarified.
We used a genetic approach to understand the interaction between atRA and dioxin and to identify the cell type targeted by dioxin toxicity during secondary palate formation in mice.
We analyzed the phenotype of mouse embryos harboring an atRA-sensitive reporter transgene or bearing null mutations for atRA-synthesizing enzymes (RALDH) or atRA receptors (RAR) and maternally exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) at gestation day 10.5.
We found that an intact atRA signal was required to enable TCDD to induce cleft palate. This mandatory atRA signal was generated through the activity of RALDH3 in the nasal epithelium and was transduced by RARγ (RARG) in the nasal mesenchyme, where it notably controlled aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) transcript levels. TCDD also did not alter the developmental pattern of atRA signaling during palate formation.
TCDD-induced alteration of secondary palate development in the mouse appears to depend on atRA signaling, which controls AHR expression. This mechanism is likely conserved throughout vertebrate evolution and may therefore be relevant in humans.
Kuwanon G was isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of methanol extract of Morus alba and its structure was elucidated by 13C-NMR, 1H-NMR and FAB-MS. Antibacterial activity of kuwanon G was investigated by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test and the viable cell count method. MIC of kuwanon G against Streptococcus mutans causing dental caries was determined to be 8.0 microg/ml. The bactericidal test showed that kuwanon G completely inactivated S. mutans at the concentration 20 microg/ml in 1 min. Kuwanon G also significantly inhibited the growth of other cariogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus sanguis, and Porpyromonas gingivalis causing periodontitis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of kuwanon G treated cells demonstrated remarkable morphological damage of the cell wall and condensation of the cytoplasm.
Two cases of fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity are presented. Significant features of these cases include the unusual pattern of rigidity and the use of fentanyl doses lower than those usually associated with muscle rigidity.
In vitro models for hepatotoxicity testing are a necessity for advancement of toxicological research. Assessing the in vitro response requires in vivo validated gene sets reflective of the hepatotoxic phenotype. Cholestasis, the impairment of bile flow, is induced in C57BL/6J mice treated with cyclosporine A (CsA) to identify phenotype reflective gene sets. CsA treatment through oral gavage for 25 days induced cholestasis, as confirmed by histopathology and serum chemistry. Over 1, 4, and 11 days of CsA exposure gradual increases in serum markers were correlated to gene expression. This phenotype-directed analysis identified gene sets specific to the onset and progression of cholestasis, such as PPAR related processes and drug metabolism, by circumventing other effects of CsA, such as immunosuppression, found in dose*time group analysis. In vivo gene sets are enriched in publicly available data sets of CsA-treated HepaRG and primary mouse hepatocytes. However, genes identified within these gene sets did not overlap between in vivo and in vitro. In vitro regulated genes represent the initial response to cholestasis, whereas in vivo genes represent the later adaptive response. We conclude that the applicability of in vitro models for hepatotoxicity testing fully depends on a solid in vivo phenotype anchored analysis.
Patients with the metabolic syndrome often have abnormal levels of proinflammatory and pro-oxidative mechanisms within their vasculature. We sought to determine whether the ACE inhibitor quinapril regulates markers of oxidative stress in the metabolic syndrome.
Forty patients with the metabolic syndrome were randomized in a double-blind manner to either the ACE inhibitor quinapril (20 mg/day) or matching placebo for 4 weeks. Serum markers of vascular oxidative stress were measured.
After 4 weeks of therapy, serum 8-isoprostane was reduced by 12% in the quinapril group when compared with placebo (quinapril, 46.7 +/- 1.0; placebo, 52.7 +/- 0.9 pg/ml; P = 0.001). Erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity increased 35% in the quinapril group when compared with placebo (quinapril, 826.3 +/- 17.1; placebo, 612.3 +/- 6.9 units/g Hb; P < 0.001). In addition, lag time to oxidation of LDL, a marker of oxidative stress, was increased by 48% in the quinapril group when compared with placebo (quinapril 89.2 +/- 9.2 vs. placebo 60.1 +/- 12.3 min; P < 0.001). Therapy with quinapril was well tolerated.
The addition of the ACE inhibitor quinapril reduces markers of vascular oxidative stress and may attenuate the progression of the pathophysiology seen in the metabolic syndrome.
Aminoglycosides have been reported to cause tetany by inducing renal wasting of magnesium and secondary hypocalcemia. A 9-year-old girl with AIDS was brought to the emergency department because of tetany. She had just finished a 3-week course of intravenous tobramycin for bronchiectasis and had an elevated serum tobramycin trough level 1 week before the onset of tetany. Hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia had developed. The urine revealed inappropriately high levels of magnesium and potassium despite critically low serum levels, with an appropriately low urine calcium level. This pattern is suggestive of renal toxicity due to tobramycin. Over the next several months, she continued to require supplemental calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. She also had nephrotic range proteinuria. Aminoglycoside renal mineral wasting has not previously been described in a child.
Cross-reactive idiotypes (CRId) borne on autoanti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies of Brown-Norway (BN) rats with mercury-induced glomerulonephritis have been described in the preceding study (Guéry, J.-C. et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 1990. 20:93). BN rats treated with sodium aurothiopropanol sulfonate or D-penicillamine, as well as (LEW X BN)F1 hybrids transferred with BN rat spleen cells, developed quite similar autoimmune abnormalities. In the present study, it is shown that immunoglobulins bearing such "public" idiotypes are also produced and deposited in the kidney in these three models. The CRId here described may, therefore, be considered as a marker of sets of recurrently expressed V region genes during the course of these autoimmune disorders. Anti-self class II T cells are present in the three models of toxin-induced autoimmunity and anti-allo class II T cells are responsible for the chronic graft-vs.-host reaction. The same B cell clones are probably triggered during these processes as a consequence of a polyclonal B cell activation mediated by anti-class II T cells.
Iron deficiency (ID) is common in cystic fibrosis (CF) and the soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is a sensitive, quantitative measurement of tissue iron deficiency. The study investigated the use of sTfR together with serum iron, transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin, in assessing iron status in adult CF patients.
The patient population consisted of 127 CF patients which consisted of 51 inpatients with infected exacerbation (IE) and 76 outpatients at the time of their annual review (AR). Serum sTfR was measured using a particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay on the Beckman Coulter LX20.
Sixty five percent (65%) of CF patients in the IE group and 28% in the AR group had ID as determined TS, but only 18% (IE group) and 20% (AR group) as determined by ferritin. Serum sTfR detected 20% in the IE group and 12% in the AR group. We found significant correlation between C-reactive protein and TS (r=-0.56; P<0.01) but not with ferritin (r=0.22; P=0.380) in the IE group.
Iron status of patients with CF can be accurately assessed by sTfR which is unaffected by the acute phase response and can be used in conjunction with serum ferritin.
The purpose of the investigation was to study the alterations in the lipid and lipoprotein content in the blood serum, the liver and the aortic wall of rats with experimentally induced salt, renal (Goldblatt) and adrenal-regeneration hypertension. The experiments were carried out on 59 Wistar rats (25 normotensive controls). It was established that both the serum and the liver lipid patterns vary in the three experimental models of hypertension. Thus, while in salt-induced hypertension no hyperlipidaemia and hyperlipoproteinaemia were established, in renal hypertension the serum lipid and lipoprotein levels were significantly increased in comparison to the controls. The cholesterol content in the liver was increased in all the three models of hypertension. The remaining lipid fractions were within normal ranges or a little decreased in salt-induced hypertension, while in renal and adrenal-regeneration hypertension their quantity was significantly increased. A two weeks' treatment with hypotensive prostaglandin E1 diminished the lipid and lipoprotein contents in the liver of rats with adrenal-regeneration hypertension, only cholesterol remaining unaltered. The blood serum level of free fatty acids increased in all the three models of experimental hypertension, as did the cholesterol and beta-lipoprotein level in the aortic wall. The alterations in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism established in this study are regarded as specific for the hypertensive process itself, since no histological alterations characteristic of atherosclerosis were observed.
The fatty-acid ethanolamide, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), is a naturally occurring lipid that regulates feeding and body weight [Rodriguez de Fonseca, F., Navarro, M., Gomez, R., Escuredo, L., Nava, F., Fu, J., Murillo-Rodriguez, E., Giuffrida, A., LoVerme, J., Gaetani, S., Kathuria, S., Gall, C., Piomelli, D., 2001. An anorexic lipid mediator regulated by feeding. Nature 414, 209-212], and serves as an endogenous agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) [Fu, J., Gaetani, S., Oveisi, F., Lo Verme, J., Serrano, A., Rodriguez De Fonseca, F., Rosengarth., A., Luecke, H., Di Giacomo, B., Tarzia, G., Piomelli, D., 2003. Oleoylethanolamide regulates feeding and body weight through activation of the nuclear receptor PPAR-alpha. Nature 425, 90-93], a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates several aspects of lipid metabolism [. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: nuclear control of metabolism. Endocr. Rev. 20, 649-688]). OEA reduces food intake in wild-type mice, but not in mice deficient in PPAR-alpha (PPAR-alpha(-/-)), an effect that is also observed with the PPAR-alpha agonists Wy-14643 and GW7647 [Brown, P.J., Chapman, J.M., Oplinger, J.A., Stuart, L.W., Willson, T.M. and Wu, Z., 2000. Chemical compounds as selective activators of PPAR-alpha. PCT Int. Appl., 32; . The PPARs: from orphan receptors to drug discovery. J. Med. Chem. 43, 527-550]. By contrast, specific agonists of PPAR-delta/beta (GW501516) or PPAR-gamma (ciglitazone) have no such effect. In obese Zucker rats, which lack functional leptin receptors, OEA reduces food intake and lowers body-weight gain along with plasma lipid levels. Similar effects are seen in diet-induced obese rats and mice. In the present study, we report that subchronic OEA treatment (5mgkg(-1), intraperitoneally, i.p., once daily for two weeks) in Zucker rats initiates transcription of PPAR-alpha and other PPAR-alpha target genes, including fatty-acid translocase (FAT/CD36), liver fatty-acid binding protein (L-FABP), and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2). Moreover, OEA decreases neutral lipid content in hepatocytes, as assessed by Oil red O staining, as well as serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The results suggest that OEA regulates lipid metabolism and that this effect may contribute to its anti-obesity properties.
Therapy of erectile dysfunction has been revolutionised in recent years, as specific pharmacological inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil, were shown to be highly effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. They dilate arterial smooth muscle cells of the corpora cavernosa, which express PDE5 abundantly, by inhibiting the breakdown of 3'5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Despite theoretical concerns of a reduced myocardial tolerance to ischaemia or promoting cardiac arrhythmias, randomised trials and retrospective analyses do not support an increased cardiac risk with oral treatment. Therapeutic doses of PDE 5 inhibitors exhibit slight blood pressure lowering effects, and do not appear to compromise coronary blood flow in coronary artery disease. However, the combination of PDE5 inhibitors with any nitric oxide donor is absolutely contraindicated because of potentially life-threatening hypotension. Before prescribing medication for erectile dysfunction, any patient with cardiovascular disease should be evaluated for a potential risk of a cardiovascular event during sexual activity according to the Princeton Consensus Panel. When a stable cardiac condition can be achieved (low risk group), oral treatment for erectile dysfunction may be appropriate.
Intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in asthmatics has been widely studied in the adult population, and to a lesser extent in children. In the present study, we present 16 asthmatics between the ages of 2 and 14 suffering from asthma induced by ASA ingestion, and the clinical characteristics are compared with a population of asthmatic children with a negative challenge test. The following results were obtained: 1) in contrast to in adults, females are not predisposed to ASA intolerance in childhood, the male:female ratio being the usual 2:1 in infantile asthma; 2) ASA intolerance can appear at a very early age (in our series the youngest was 1 year old); 3) extrinsic asthmatics are the most commonly affected, and also children with exercise-induced asthma; 4) in extrinsic asthmatics with asthma attacks precipitated by ASA, sinusitis is more frequent than in extrinsic asthmatics with ASA tolerance; 5) polyposis is exceptional; 6) the presence of associated urticaria is frequent, and much greater than in adult ASA-intolerant asthmatics; and 7) the results of the challenge with NSAIDs are similar to those obtained in adult patients, which would indicate a common pathophysiological mechanism related to the capacity of these drugs to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity.
LASSBio-767 [(-)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline] and LASSBio-822 [(-)-3-O-tert-Boc-spectaline] were recently described as cholinesterase inhibitors derived from the natural piperidine alkaloid (-)-spectaline, obtained from the flowers of Senna spectabilis (Fabaceae). We investigated their mechanism of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and their efficacy in reversing scopolamine-induced amnesia. Competition assays with the substrate acetylthiocholine showed a concentration-dependent reduction in rat brain cholinesterase Vmax without changes in apparent Km. The kinetic data for LASSBio-767 and LASSBio-822 were best fit by a model of simple linear noncompetitive inhibition with Ki of 6.1 microM and 7.5 microM, respectively. A dilution assay showed a fast and complete reversal of inhibition, independent of incubation time. Simulated docking of the compounds into the catalytic gorge of Torpedo acetylcholinesterase showed interactions with the peripheral anionic site, but not with the catalytic triad. Anti-amnestic effects in mice were assessed in a step-down passive avoidance test and in the Morris water maze 30 min after injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.). Saline, LASSBio-767, or LASSBio-822 was administered 15 min before scopolamine. Both compounds reversed the scopolamine-induced reduction in step-down latency at 0.1 mg/kg i.p. LASSBio-767 reversed scopolamine-induced changes in water maze escape latency at 1 mg/kg i.p. or p.o., while its cholinergic side effects were absent or mild up to 30 mg/kg i.p. (LD50 above 100 mg/kg i.p.). Thus, the (-)-spectaline derivatives are potent cholinergic agents in vivo, with a unique profile combining noncompetitive cholinesterase inhibition and CNS selectivity, with few peripheral side effects.
Horary plasmatic dosages of Dopa and metabolites in 30 treated parkinsonian patients have shown that, within the group of patients treated with L-Dopa combined with an extracerebral decarboxylase inhibitor, highly significant by increased plasmatic O-methyl-dopa levels can be found in patients with dyskinesias compared with those without dyskinesias. On the contrary, in these two subgroups of patients, plasmatic Dopa levels are not significantly different. By comparing some favoured Dopa and O-methyl-dopa levels between these two subgroups of patients, it seems more likely, that the elevated plasmatic O-methyl-dopa levels are due to an progressive accumulation on of its compound than to an excessive formation from Dopa.
Use of ibuprofen in patients with asymptomatic renal failure is known to produce acute renal toxicity. One of the manifestations is interstitial nephritis of which the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, this nephrotoxic syndrome was induced in rabbits by giving a single dose of uranyl nitrate, followed by consecutive doses of ibuprofen. This animal model thus allowed the assessment of renal functional and pathological changes associated with ibuprofen use in renal insufficiency. In these rabbits, the major abnormality appeared to be confined to the tubulointerstitial compartment. Microscopic examinations of the renal necropsy specimens showed tubular necrosis and interstitial lymphocytic infiltration. The histological finding of lymphocytic aggregation suggests that this nephrotoxic effect stems from a cytotoxic immune reaction in the interstitium. Moreover, levels of renal 2-arylpropionyl-CoA epimerase, a key enzyme involved in the metabolic inversion of ibuprofen, showed a significant reduction, which may result from the massive destruction of the tubular cells in these animals. These results support the premise that renal insufficiency is a prerequisite factor for ibuprofen-induced interstitial nephritis.
The goal of this study was to examine the lifetime prevalence of antisocial personality disorder according to five diagnostic systems and the prevalence of psychopathy in a study group of women. The relationship between antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy was also examined. Finally, differences in treatment admission variables based on the presence or absence of antisocial personality disorder and/or psychopathy were evaluated.
Antisocial personality disorder was diagnosed in 137 treatment-seeking, cocaine-dependent women according to the Feighner criteria, Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), and DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV criteria. Psychopathy was assessed by the Revised Psychopathy Checklist.
Rates of antisocial personality disorder varied from 76% according to the Feighner criteria to 11% for the RDC. Nineteen percent (N = 26) of the women scored in the moderate to high range on the Revised Psychopathy Checklist. All of these women were diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder according to DSM-III and Feighner criteria, but only 15 of the 26 were diagnosed according to DSM-III-R, 12 according to DSM-IV, and six with the RDC. Moderate levels of psychopathy were associated with a history of illegal activity at treatment admission, whereas antisocial personality disorder was not.
There was relatively little diagnostic agreement between classification systems. This study indicates that antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy are not synonymous terms for the same disorder. Findings support a need to redefine antisocial personality disorder diagnostic criteria to make them gender neutral by including behaviors associated specifically with antisociality in women.
Fentanyl-induced hyperalgesia and antinociception after systemic administration has been shown in previous clinical and experimental studies. However, there is very little evidence regarding the local possible effects of fentanyl. The purpose of this study was to assess whether local (intraplantar) fentanyl administration can produce antinociception and hyperalgesia. In addition, we examined the effects of magnesium, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, on possible changes produced by fentanyl. The paw withdrawal latencies to radiant heat stimuli were measured to assess the thermal nociceptive actions. Intraplantar administration of fentanyl caused time and dose-dependent increase in the paw withdrawal latencies (antinociception). Coinjection of magnesium with fentanyl markedly enhanced the antinociception. However, fentanyl also markedly decreased paw withdrawal latencies 24 h after intraplantar administration (hyperalgesia). In the presence of magnesium, hyperalgesia after fentanyl administration was not observed. Consequently, following the fentanyl administration, local hyperalgesia after antinociception is a negative effect in pain treatment. Magnesium may not only prevent the hyperalgesia but also enhance antinociceptive effect of fentanyl.
25 patients with residual or recurrent ovarian cancer were treated with the new platinum complex zeniplatin (CL 286,558) and 23 patients were evaluable for response. Responses were achieved in 4 patients, 1 complete and 3 partial remissions (16%). 7 patients had stable disease and 12 patients had tumour progression. At a median follow-up of 12 months, the median progression-free survival in responding patients was 11 months and overall survival 81%. The median overall survival of progressive patients amounted to 9 months, indicating the advanced stage of disease in most patients. Renal function was monitored by isotope clearance studies. There was no significant change in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in 10 patients who completed six cycles of treatment. 1 patient with a marginal creatinine clearance at baseline suffered from sudden and severe renal failure during the first cycle. Zeniplatin may be active in relapsing, platinum-pretreated patients, and has no direct effects on renal function as measured by isotope clearance. Despite these findings, occasional nephrotoxicity may occur in patients with compromised kidney function, even with prophylactic hydration, and thus limit the application of this new analogue.
The role of oxidative stress in different aortopathies is evaluated. Thirty-two tissue samples from 18 men and 14 women were divided into: 4 control (C) subjects, 11 patients with systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), 4 with variants of Marfan's syndrome (MV), 9 with Marfan's syndrome (M), 2 with Turner's syndrome, and 2 with Takayasu's arteritis (TA). Aorta fragments were homogenized. Lipoperoxidation (LPO), copper-zinc and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn and Cu-Zn-SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), nitrates and nitrites (NO3(-)/NO2(-)), and type IV collagen, and laminin were evaluated. There was an increase in Mn- and Cu-Zn-SOD activity in SAH, MV, M, and Turner's syndrome. There was also an increase in CAT activity in M and Turner' syndrome. GPx and GST activity decreased and LPO increased in all groups. eNOS was decreased in SAH, MV, and M and NO3 (-)/NO2 (-) were increased in SAH and TA. Type IV collagen was decreased in Turner's syndrome and TA. Laminin γ-1 was decreased in MV and increased in M. In conclusion, similarities and differences in oxidative stress in the different aortopathies studied including pathologies with aneurysms were found with alterations in SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and eNOS activity that modify subendothelial basement membrane proteins.
This case report presents a patient who developed persistent hiccups after epidural administration of dilute bupivacaine on several different occasions. Substitution of saline for the dilute bupivacaine during epidural steroid injection did not result in hiccups; however, subsequent postoperative epidural analgesia with bupivacaine caused a recurrence of the hiccups.
We have evaluated the properties of a new class of anti-inflammatory agents derived from capsaicin, using the analogs NE-19550 (N-vanillyloleamide) and NE-28345 (N-oleyl-homovanillamide) as examples. This class displayed an atypical profile in the assays utilized, including 1) anti-edema and antileukocyte migration activity in the rat carrageenan pleurisy assay without suppression of pleural prostanoid synthesis, 2) blockade of human platelet aggregation induced by arachidonate or PAF but not that induced by the PGH2 analog U-46619, without equivalent inhibition in vitro of mammalian cyclooxygenase or thromboxane synthetase preparations, 3) greater potency and efficacy in the rat implanted sponge assay than in the adjuvant arthritis assay, without inhibition of LTB4 or 15-HETE synthesis in vitro, 4) stronger topical activity in the mouse croton oil inflamed ear assay than the guinea pig UV erythema assay, and 5) oral activity in the rat carrageenan paw edema assay and mouse phenylquinone abdominal constriction rest combined with failure to induce gastric erosion in rats at therapeutic doses. We conclude that NE-19550 and NE-28345 do not act like conventional NSAIDs via suppression of arachidonic acid metabolism.
The authors report an autopsy case of methamphetamine-related intracranial hemorrhage and vasculitis. A 22-year-old female was comatose after an intravenous injection of an unknown dose of methamphetamine. Computed tomographic scans demonstrated massive subarachnoid hemorrhage and hematoma in the corpus callosum. Cerebral angiography revealed nonfilling of bilateral intracranial carotid arteries and extravasation of contrast medium from the right pericallosal artery which was visualized retrogradely via the vertebral artery. Postmortem studies found cerebral edema, subarachnoid, intraventricular, and intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracranial vasculitis, but no aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. Necrosis of vessel walls with destruction of the smooth muscle layer, but no leukocytotic infiltration of the vessel walls were observed in all major cerebral arteries. The hemorrhage probably resulted from medial necrosis in the large intracerebral vessels, and a sudden drug-induced rise in blood pressure.
A 56-year-old woman was evaluated for the surgical correction of hyperopia (+3.0 diopters). Two drops of cyclopentolate 1% were instilled in both eyes for measurement of the cycloplegic refraction and wavefront analysis. Immediately after the second instillation, the patient reported drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. Ten minutes later, stimulatory central nervous system symptoms in the form of restlessness, cheerfulness, and a 20-minute-long roar of laughter were observed, interrupted by a new sedative phase. Basic medical and neurologic examinations were unremarkable except for gait ataxia. Four hours later, the examination was continued uneventfully. As surgical treatment of refractive errors and measurement of cycloplegic refraction using cyclopentolate become more frequent, ophthalmologists should be aware of this unusual acute event.
A 2-year-old white female receiving multidrug chemotherapy for treatment of a primitive neuroectodermal tumor developed acute hypotension, bradycardia, and shock following administration of ondansetron and high-dose methylprednisolone. The subsequent clinical course is described, and cardiovascular reactions to ondansetron and methylprednisolone are reviewed. While the etiology of this severe reaction is uncertain, it is possible that it represents an idiosyncratic reaction to the rapid administration of high-dose adrenal corticosteroids. Patients receiving high-dose corticosteroid therapy should be closely monitored, and slow rates of infusion are recommended.
