Ivermectin is one of the most commonly used drugs in pharmacotherapy of parasitic diseases in domestic and wild animals caused by parasitic nematodes and arthropods. However, ivermectin and other avermectins very often produce side-effects in hosts. The most dominant clinical symptom of ivermectin toxicity in domestic and wild animals is CNS depression. In nematodes, the target site of ivermectin's action is glutamate-gated chloride-channel receptor and GABA receptor. The depressive effect of ivermectin in mammals might include more than one mechanism; therefore, the anticonvulsive effect of ivermectin against convulsions caused by lidocaine and strychnine was evaluated. Ivermectin antagonized lidocaine- and strychnine-induced convulsions in rats, although these have different mechanisms. In the present study, the anticonvulsive ED50 ofivermectin for lidocaine-induced convulsions was 2.44 mg/kg (95% CL 1.67 to 3.57 mg/kg), whereas for convulsions induced by strychnine it was higher at 4.25 mg/kg (95% CL 2.32 to 3.78 mg/kg). At the same time, both anticonvulsive doses are significantly lower then the observed LD50 of ivermectin (18.20 mg/kg). Furthermore, flumazenil (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg), an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors, antagonizes just one part of these anticonvulsive effects of ivermectin. Our results show the significant anticonvulsive properties of ivermectin and support the findings that ivermectin in the CNS of mammals produces multiple inhibitory effects, probably through participation in the function of GABA-sensitive and GABA-insensitive chloride channels.
Adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase (ALAP) is a recently identified member of the M1 family of zinc-metallopeptidases and is thought to play a role in blood pressure control through inactivation of angiotensin II and/or generation of bradykinin. The enzyme seems to be particularly abundant in the heart. Recently, the Arg528-encoding allele of the ALAP gene was shown to be associated with essential hypertension.
We evaluated the influence of this polymorphism on the change in left ventricular mass index in 90 patients with essential hypertension and echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy, randomised in a double-blind study to receive treatment with either the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist irbesartan or the beta1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol for 48 weeks. Genyotyping was performed using minisequencing.
After adjustment for potential covariates (blood pressure and left ventricular mass index at baseline, blood pressure change, age, sex, dose and added antihypertensive treatment), there was a marked difference between the Arg/Arg and Lys/Arg genotypes in patients treated with irbesartan; those with the Arg/Arg genotype responded on average with an almost two-fold greater regression of left ventricular mass index than patients with the Lys/Arg genotype (-30.1 g/m2 [3.6] vs -16.7 [4.5], p = 0.03).
The ALAP genotype seems to determine the degree of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy during antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist irbesartan in patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. This is the first report of a role for ALAP/aminopeptidases in left ventricular mass regulation, and suggests a new potential target for antihypertensive drugs.
The high mortality in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) has been attributed to pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Endothelin-1 (ET-1), nitric oxide (NO), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) have been reported to be important vasoactive mediators in the perinatal pulmonary circulation. The exact mechanism by which these vasoactive mediators interact to regulate the perinatal pulmonary vascular tone in CDH with PPH is not fully understood. We hypothesized that the altered pulmonary vascular reactivity in CDH is due to imbalance in vasoactive mediators. This study was designed to investigate mRNA expression of ET-1, eNOS, and CGRP in CDH lung in the perinatal period. A CDH model was induced in pregnant rats following administration of nitrofen. In control animals, the same dose of olive oil was given without nitrofen. Cesarean section was performed on day 21 of gestation. The newborn rats were intubated and ventilated, and ventilation was continued for 1-6 h. Left lungs were collected from both groups at 0, 1, and 6 h after ventilation (n=8 in each group). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on lung tissue was performed to evaluate the relative level of ET-1, eNOS, and CGRP mRNA expression. The results showed a significant increase in ET-1 mRNA in CDH lung at 1 and 6 h after ventilation compared with controls. In CDH lung, eNOS mRNA and CGRP mRNA levels were significantly increased at 1 h but were similar to control values at 6 h after ventilation. The increased expression of vasoconstrictor ET-1 mRNA and vasodilators eNOS mRNA and CGRP mRNA in the CDH lung at 1 h after ventilation suggests that pulmonary vascular tone is rapidly changing after birth. An imbalance in the production of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators by the CDH lung may contribute to high pulmonary vascular resistance.
The methylation status of the androgen receptor gene (AR) in leukemia cell lines was investigated. Results showed the presence of both methylated and unmethylated CpG islands of the AR promotor in leukemia cell lines. In the normal blood samples, only unmethylated bands were observed. In 15 bone marrow samples from patients with leukemia, 12 cases (80%) showed both methylated and unmethylated alleles and 3 cases (20%) showed only methylated alleles. To understand whether AR mRNA and protein expression are reduced by methylation, we treated leukemia cells with 5-Aza-Dc and detected the expression of mRNA and protein by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The treatment of 5-Aza-Dc increased AR expression in all cell lines researched. This study indicates that reduced AR mRNA expression in leukemia cell lines was in part related to DNA methylation. The aberrant methylation of AR gene could be one molecular and genetic alteration in leukemia.
Seven out of nine Penicillium isolates from mouldy maize in Yugoslavia have been differentiated into the adjacent species P. aurantiogriseum and P. commune. Nephrotoxicity of cultured mycelia in the rat has been demonstrated for all isolates of both species and was correlated usefully, though indirectly, with the production of benzodiazepine secondary metabolites, notably auranthine. Shredded wheat (22 g) moulded by an example of each species and fed to a rat over 4 days elicited renal pathology in the P3 segment of proximal tubules, involving frequent pyknosis and extensive mitosis typical of this as yet uncharacterised toxin. The effect was attributed in P. aurantiogriseum at least partly to the spores. Prominent pathology was elicited by only 1g of spores given over 4 days.
Sixteen years ago, we demonstrated, by immunological and biochemical approaches, that seven subunits of complex I are encoded in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes in mammalian cells. More recently, we carried out a biochemical, molecular, and cellular analysis of a mutation in the gene for one of these subunits, ND4, that causes Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). We demonstrated that, in cells carrying this mutation, the mtDNA-encoded subunits of complex I are assembled into a complex, but the rate of complex I-dependent respiration is decreased. Subsequently, we isolated several mutants affected in one or another of the mtDNA-encoded subunits of complex I by exposing established cell lines to high concentrations of rotenone. Our analyses of these mtDNA mutations affecting subunits of complex I have shown that at least two of these subunits, ND4 and ND6, are essential for the assembly of the enzyme. ND5 appears to be located at the periphery of the enzyme and, while it is not essential for assembly of the other mtDNA-encoded subunits into a complex, it is essential for complex I activity. In fact, the synthesis of the ND5 polypeptide is rate limiting for the activity of the enzyme.
1. Oedema formation induced by intradermal capsaicin has been studied in rabbit skin. The effect of the anti-inflammatory steroid dexamethasone and also of a range of known inhibitors of oedema formation have been investigated in order to elucidate mechanisms involved in capsaicin-induced oedema formation. 2. Oedema formation, in response to intradermally-injected test agents, was measured by the local extravascular accumulation of intravenously injected 125I-labelled albumin. In separate experiments skin blood flow was assessed by the clearance of intradermally-injected 133xenon. 3. Oedema formation induced by intradermal histamine (3 nmol) and bradykinin (1 nmol), when in the presence of vasodilator doses of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (3 pmol) or prostaglandin E1, (PGE1) (10 pmol), was significantly inhibited (P < 0.01) in rabbits pretreated with intravenous dexamethasone (3 mg kg-1, -4 h). In contrast dexamethasone had no effect on capsaicin (3 mumol)-induced oedema formation or, on capsaicin (30-100 nmol)-induced blood flow. 4. Oedema formation observed in response to intradermal capsaicin (3 mumol) was significantly inhibited (P < 0.01) when the selective capsaicin antagonist, ruthenium red (3 nmol) was co-injected. This suggests that the mechanism of capsaicin-induced oedema involves activation of sensory nerves. However, oedema was not inhibited when capsaicin was co-injected with the neurokinin NK1 receptor antagonist, RP67580 (10 nmol), the NK2 antagonist SR48960 (10 nmol) or the CGRP antagonist CGRP8-37 (300 pmol). 5. Oedema formation induced by capsaicin was not inhibited when co-injected with the histamine HI receptor antagonist, mepyramine (3 nmol), the PAF antagonist, WEB 2086 (100 nmol), the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, Hoel4O (1 nmol), or the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 nmol),suggesting that these mediators do not play a major role in the capsaicin-induced response.6. Histological analysis of capsaicin-treated skin sites revealed undamaged, intact microvessels and lack of haemorrhage. Further, co-injection of capsaicin with the hydrogen peroxide remover, catalase(2,200 u), had no effect on oedema formation. This suggests that capsaicin does not induce oedema formation secondary to free radical-induced damage.7. These results indicate that capsaicin-induced oedema in rabbit skin involves activation of sensory nerves. However, the oedema is not inhibited by pretreatment with the anti-inflammatory steroid,dexamethasone. Further the mechanisms which lead to the oedema formation observed after intradermal capsaicin remain unknown.
Carcinoma progression is associated with the loss of epithelial features, and the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype by tumour cells. Herein we show that exposure of MCF-7 cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF) resulted in morphological alterations characteristic of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EGF treatment resulted in increased motility along with an up-regulation of transcription factors Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2, and mesenchymal markers Vimentin and N-cadherin. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with a combined stimulation of EGF and resveratrol, a naturally occurring stilbene with antitumor properties, failed to alter cell morphology, motility and overexpression of EMT markers induced by EGF. Using specific chemical inhibitors, we demonstrated that EGF-induced EMT is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) signalling pathway and that resveratrol is able to repress EGF-induced ERK activation. In summary, these data provide new evidence of the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on EGF-induced EMT cell transformation.
Losartan is an orally active, nonpeptide, selective angiotensin subtype 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist. It provides a more specific and complete blockade of the actions of angiotensin II than renin or ACE inhibitors. Short term (up to 12 weeks' duration) clinical trials have shown losartan to be as effective at lowering blood pressure (BP) [causes a decrease in BP < or = 26/20 mm Hg] in elderly patients with hypertension as recommended dosages of captopril, atenolol, enalapril, felodipine and nifedipine. In patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) the efficacy of losartan was similar to that of atenolol. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to losartan therapy provides greater antihypertensive efficacy, equivalent to that seen with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. Preliminary evidence also indicates that losartan therapy contributes to the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy associated with chronic hypertension. Exercise capacity is increased by losartan in patients with either asymptomatic or symptomatic heart failure. Results from the Losartan Heart Failure Survival or ELITE II (Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly II) study indicate that there was no statistically significant difference between losartan and captopril in reducing overall deaths or in reducing sudden cardiac death and/or resuscitated cardiac arrest in patients with heart failure. Other than ELITE II, little conclusive long term mortality and morbidity data exist for losartan. Additional long term trials to evaluate the survival benefits of losartan in elderly patients with hypertension, renal disease or after an acute myocardial infarction are currently in progress. In elderly patients with hypertension, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events associated with once daily losartan (alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide) [19 to 27%] was similar to felodipine (23%) and nifedipine (21%), however, losartan tended to be better tolerated than captopril (11 vs 16%). Losartan was also better tolerated than atenolol in patients with ISH (10.4 vs 23%). In patients with heart failure the renal tolerability of losartan was similar to that of captopril, but losartan was associated with a lower withdrawal rate because of adverse events. No dosage adjustment is required in elderly or in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction, and the risk of first-dose hypotension is low.
comparative data have shown losartan to be as effective as other antihypertensive agents in the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension. Treatment with losartan is therefore an option for first-line therapy in all patients with hypertension, particularly those who are not well managed with or who are intolerant of their current therapy. Morbidity and mortality data from the Losartan Heart Failure Survival (ELITE II) study show that losartan has potential in the treatment of heart failure.
Effects of 2 organophosphorus compounds, O,O-dimethyl O-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)phosphate (DDVP) and O,O-dimethyl O-(3-methyl 4-nitrophenyl)phosphorothioate (fenitrothion), on the brain cholinergic system were investigated in Japanese quail. Cholinergic signs, such as salivation and convulsions in legs and wings, were seen 7-15 min after administration with DDVP (3-4 mg/kg) or 6-120 min after administration with fenitrothion (250-350 mg/kg). In the DDVP-treated quail (10 min after dosage of 3 mg/kg), free acetylcholine (ACh), labile-bound ACh, increased significantly and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) decreased to 28% of the value determined in untreated quail. In the fenitrothion-treated group (60 min after dosage of 300 mg/kg), only free ACh increased and AChE activity decreased to 20% of the control value. In vitro, DDVP and fenitrothion inhibited AChE activity in brain homogenate with an I50 of 10(-8) M and 10(-5) M, respectively. It appeared that both organophosphorus compounds might have essentially the same effect on the brain cholinergic system. There were only small differences in the effect on various fractions of ACh between the 2 compounds, although there was a hundred-fold range in dose.
Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets containing FD and C red dye No. 40 for 2 weeks and were then bred. The diets were continued for the females throughout gestation and lactation and were provided continuously to their offspring thereafter. The treatment groups were: FD and C red dye No. 40 as 0.0, 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0% of the diet, and a positive control group treated with the toxin hydroxyurea on days 2-10 of life with 50 mg/kg/day given s.c. as a positive control group. Parental animals were evaluated for weight and food consumption, and females for reproductive success. The offspring were assessed on a series of tests using the Cincinnati Psychoteratogenicity Screening Test Battery. Additional measures were weight, food consumption, physical landmarks of development, and brain weight. Red-40 significantly reduced reproductive success, parental and offspring weight, brain weight, survival, and female vaginal patency development. Behaviorally, R40 produced substantially decreased running wheel activity, and slightly increased postweaning open-field rearing activity. Overall, R40 produced evidence of both physical and behavioral toxicity in developing rats at doses of up to 10% of the diet.
The porphyrinogenic action of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) was examined in 17-day-old embryos, day-old chicks, 18-day-old chickens and adult Japanese quail. The quail was found to be the most sensitive species towards TCB induced porphyria whereas the chick embryo was totally non-responsive. The liver porphyrins of Japanese quail were increased in a dose-dependent manner 1 day after TCB. Elevation in porphyrin levels in quail was associated with comparable increases in delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase (ALA-S) activity 1 day after TCB treatment. In contrast, ferrochelatase activity was found to be unchanged 1 day after TCB. Multiple administration of TCB produced only a slight increase in liver porphyrin levels and ALA-S activity in quail. However, there was a marked induction in ferrochelatase activity suggesting increased porphyrin turnover. Liver glutathione and glutathione S-transferase activity were also significantly increased following repeated administration of TCB in quail, which could indicate an enhancement of detoxication of reactive metabolites of TCB. Thus, it is suggested that the inability of low multiple doses of TCB to cause porphyria in Japanese quail may be related to the low responsiveness of ALA-S but high inducibility of ferrochelatase liver GSH and glutathione S-transferase.
By analyzing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in a genome-wide association study (313,504 SNPs, three series, 844 cases and 1,255 controls) and evaluating the 25 SNPs with the most significant allelic association in four additional series (1,547 cases and 1,209 controls), we identified a SNP (rs5984894) on Xq21.3 in PCDH11X that is strongly associated with LOAD in individuals of European descent from the United States. Analysis of rs5984894 by multivariable logistic regression adjusted for sex gave global P values of 5.7 x 10(-5) in stage 1, 4.8 x 10(-6) in stage 2 and 3.9 x 10(-12) in the combined data. Odds ratios were 1.75 (95% CI = 1.42-2.16) for female homozygotes (P = 2.0 x 10(-7)) and 1.26 (95% CI = 1.05-1.51) for female heterozygotes (P = 0.01) compared to female noncarriers. For male hemizygotes (P = 0.07) compared to male noncarriers, the odds ratio was 1.18 (95% CI = 0.99-1.41).
We investigated the cytotoxic effects of formaldehyde (FA) on lymphocytes. FA-exposed mice showed a profound reduction not only in the number of natural killer (NK) cells but also in the expression of NK cell-specific receptors, but these mice did not exhibit decreases in the numbers of T or B lymphocytes. FA exposure also induced decreases in NK cytolytic activity and in the expression of NK cell-associated genes, such as IFN-γ, perforin and CD122. To determine the effect of FA on tumorigenicity, C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously injected with B16F10 melanoma cells after FA exposure. The mass of the B16F10 tumor and the concentration of extravascular polymorphonuclear leukocytes were greater than those in unexposed tumor-bearing control mice. The number and cytolytic activity of NK cells were also reduced in B16F10 tumor-bearing mice exposed to FA. To determine how FA reduces the NK cell number, NK precursor (pNK) cells were treated with FA, and the differentiation status of the NK cells was analyzed. NK cell differentiation was impaired by FA treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings indicate that FA exposure may promote tumor progression by impairing NK cell function and differentiation.
A 34-year-old woman who had been treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) for hyperthyroidism, was admitted because of bloody sputum and pyrexia. The chest CT scan showed some nodules in both lung fields. The serum level of myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) was high, but proteinase-3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR-3 ANCA) was negative. A limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis without PR-3 ANCA was ruled out, because of the absence of abnormalities in the upper airway and kidney. No lesions other than the multiple pulmonary nodules of the lung were detected. We diagnosed MPO-ANCA associated vasculitis induced by PTU. After the termination of PTU, bloody sputum, pyrexia, and pulmonary nodules improved spontaneously and the serum level of MPO-ANCA returned to normal gradually. The case of MPO-ANCA positive vasculitis associated with multiple pulmonary nodules following propylthiouracil treatment is very rare.
The motor effects of selective D-1 dopamine receptor stimulation in Parkinson's disease have been explored in a limited number of studies with partial D-1 agonists only and the results were unsatisfactory. Four 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-exposed parkinsonian monkeys already exhibiting levodopa- and dopamine agonist-induced dyskinesia received selective D-1 agonists ([2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7-8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1-H-3-benzazepine- HCI] (SKF 38393), [(+-)6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- 1H-3-benzazepine hydrobromide] (SKF 82958), [(1R, 3S)3-(1'-adamantyl)-1-aminomethyl-3,4-dihydro-5,6- dihydroxy-1H-2-benzopyran hydrochloride] (A-77636) and [(-)-(6aR)(12bR)-4,6,6a,7,8,12b-hexahydro-7-methyli ndolo (4,3-ab)-phenanthridine] (CY 208-243)) to compare these drugs with selective D-2 agonists (LY 171555, (+)-4-propyl-9- hydroxynaphthoxazine and bromocriptine) and levodopa in terms of antiparkinsonian efficacy and side effects. The D-1 class of compounds was as efficacious as the D-2 agents in alleviating parkinsonism in these animals. However, D-1 agonists were, in general, less likely to reproduce dyskinesia. In addition, D-1 agonists occasionally improved motor symptoms without concomitant dyskinesia, unlike D-2 agonists or levodopa (which always produced some dyskinesia with improvement in motor function). These preliminary results do not support the hypothesis that preferential D-1 receptor stimulation facilitates dyskinesia in primates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To evaluate the intraocular pressure (IOP)-reducing effect and the side effects of latanoprost (PhXA41), a new phenyl-substituted prostaglandin F2 alpha-isopropyl ester analogue, in patients with elevated IOP, using timolol maleate as the reference drug.
A total of 184 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension at 35 medical centers participated in this randomized double-masked study. The patients were randomized to receive either 0.005% latanoprost once daily or 0.5% timolol maleate twice daily, for a period of 12 weeks. Intraocular pressure was measured 24 hours after the administration of timolol, at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.
Latanoprost reduced IOP at the end of 12 weeks by 6.2 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) (26.8%), while timolol reduced IOP by 4.4 +/- 2.3 mm Hg (19.9%). At all visits latanoprost reduced IOP significantly more than timolol did. The main ocular side effects observed in both groups were conjunctival hyperemia and smarting. The main systemic side effect was a reduced pulse rate, which occurred in patients treated with timolol.
The results of this study demonstrated that 0.005% latanoprost taken once daily is well tolerated and more effective in reducing IOP than 0.5% timolol taken twice daily. Thus, latanoprost may become an important choice for the medical treatment of glaucoma.
Acute cocaine overdose can result in convulsions and death although the mechanisms associated with this toxicity are poorly understood. The role of D1 receptors in the central and peripheral actions in cocaine were investigated by comparisons of cocaine with the stable charged cocaine analog, cocaine methiodide. Both cocaine and cocaine methiodide produced dose-related increases in lethality in male, Swiss Webster mice, with cocaine methiodide being slightly more potent than cocaine; however, only cocaine produced convulsions. Several dopamine D1 antagonists ([R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3- benzazepine] (SCH 23390), [(-)-trans-6,7,7a,8, 9,13b-hexahydro-3-chloro-2-hydroxy-N-methyl-5H-benzo[d]naptho++ +-(2-1-b)azepin e (SCH 39166), 1-(2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-2-methyl- 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline HBr (A-69024), [R-(+)-7-bromo-8-hydroxy-3- methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine] (SK F83566)) produced dose-dependent protection against the lethal effects of both compounds. Protection against cocaine methiodide-induced lethality was conferred by lower doses of the D1 antagonists than those effective against cocaine. Stereoselectivity of this effect was demonstrated by the lack of activity of the inactive enantiomer of SCH 23390. The D2 antagonist haloperidol was ineffective against either cocaine- or cocaine methiodide-induced lethality. Lethal effects of the nondopaminergic local anesthetic, lidocaine, were not influenced by prior treatment with D1 antagonists. Lethal effects of cocaine were enhanced by both centrally and peripherally acting D1 agonists but not by the D2 agonist quinpirole. Cocaine methiodide-induced lethality was also enhanced by the peripherally active DA1 agonist, fenoldopam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) elevating potential of 1.0% rimexolone and 0.1% fluorometholone alcohol ophthalmic suspensions in patients known to have responded to corticosteroids.
In a double-masked, randomized, single-eye, crossover protocol, corticosteroid responsiveness initially was verified in 40 asymptomatic known steroid responders by challenge with either 0.1% dexamethasone sodium phosphate or 1.0% prednisolone acetate for up to 6 weeks. After a 1-month medication washout, subjects randomly received either rimexolone or fluorometholone for 6 weeks. Medications were again discontinued for 1 month, and subjects then received the alternate drug for 6 weeks.
There was no significant difference between rimexolone and fluorometholone in the number of subjects demonstrating a 10-mm Hg increase in IOP or in the mean number of weeks required to achieve a 10-mm Hg response. Responses occurred in significantly more subjects receiving dexamethasone sodium phosphate (P = .001) or prednisolone acetate (P < .001) and in a significantly shorter interval than in subjects receiving rimexolone.
Rimexolone has a low IOP-elevating potential, comparable to that of fluorometholone and less than that of dexamethasone sodium phosphate and prednisolone acetate.
Liver fibrosis results from chronic damage to the liver by chronic hepatitis, alcohol, and toxic agents. A characteristic of liver fibrosis is an accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, which distorts the hepatic architecture by forming a fibrous scar, and the subsequent development of regenerating nodules defines cirrhosis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, one of the most powerful profibrogenic mediators, plays a major role in the development of liver cirrhosis and regulates ECM gene expression and matrix degradation. This study elucidates the changes of TGF-beta1-mediated signals during liver fibrogenesis by using RNA interference. In this experiment, the TGF-beta1 siRNAs reduced the expression of TGF-beta1 in the livers of CCl(4) injection compared with those of control group, and the expression of type I collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin was decreased. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that TGF-beta1 siRNAs inhibit TGF-beta1 expression in the murine model of liver cirrhosis and might be a good therapeutic strategy to prevent liver cirrhosis in human.
The aim of this study was to compare the recovery cycle of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in children with migraine without aura before and after treatment with topiramate. Eleven migraine children were studied before and after a 3-month treatment with topiramate at the average dose of 1.3 mg/kg/day. We calculated the SEP latency and amplitude modifications after paired electrical stimuli at 5, 20 and 40 ms interstimulus intervals, comparing them with a single stimulus condition assumed as baseline. In nine patients, who had a significant reduction in headache frequency after treatment, the recovery cycles of the P24 (P = 0.03) and N30 (P < 0.005) potentials were longer after than before topiramate treatment. In two migraineurs who did not show any improvement, the recovery cycles of the cortical SEP components were even shorter after treatment. Our results suggest that topiramate efficacy in paediatric migraine prophylaxis is probably related to restored cortical excitability.
JTP-4819 ((S)-2-[[(S)-2-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl]carbonyl]-N- phenylmethyl)-1-pyrrolidinecarboxamide) is a potent (IC50: 0.83 +/- 0.09 nM in rat brain supernatant; 5.43 +/- 0.81 nM in Flavobacterium meningosepticum) and specific inhibitor of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP). JTP-4819 (3 mg/kg p.o.) exhibited a strong and durable ex vivo inhibitory effect on PEP in various regions of the rat brain. In addition, JTP-4819 inhibited the degradation of substance P, arginine-vasopressin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, neurotensin, oxytocin, bradykinin, and angiotensin II by purified PEP with IC50 values of 9.6, 13.9, 10.7, 14.0, 4.5, 7.6 and 10.6 nM, respectively. In the one-trial passive avoidance test in rats with scopolamine-induced amnesia, JTP-4819 significantly prolonged the retention time when administered orally at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg 1 hr before acquisition or at 3 and 10 mg/kg 1 hr before retention. In addition, coadministration of JTP-4819 and substance P, arginine-vasopressin or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (at doses at which each drug alone did not prolong the retention time) improved the retention time of rats with scopolamine-induced amnesia. Microdialysis studies demonstrated that JTP-4819 caused a significant increase in ACh release in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of young rats at oral doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg, as well as in both brain regions of aged rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg. These results indicate that JTP-4819 potentiates neuropeptide functions inhibiting PEP, that it activates cholinergic transmission and that it enhances learning and memory.
The clinical study on the Romanian product Trofopar was performed on 71 patients affected by chronic liver diseases; of them 30 patients suffered from cirrhosis decompensated at the parenchymal and vascular level. The clinical results corroborated with laboratory tests substantiate the efficacy of Trofopar, which improves liver blood circulation, increases the capacity of hepatocyte regeneration, detoxification and metabolization.
Oral administration of ajulemic acid (AjA), a cannabinoid acid devoid of psychoactivity, reduces joint tissue damage in rats with adjuvant arthritis. Because interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) are central to the progression of inflammation and joint tissue injury in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, we investigated human monocyte IL-1beta and TNFalpha responses after the addition of AjA to cells in vitro. Peripheral blood and synovial fluid monocytes (PBM and SFM) were isolated from healthy subjects and patients with inflammatory arthritis, respectively, treated with AjA (0-30 microM) in vitro, and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Cells were harvested for mRNA, and supernatants were collected for cytokine assay. Addition of AjA to PBM and SFM in vitro reduced both steady-state levels of IL-1beta mRNA and secretion of IL-1beta in a concentration-dependent manner. Suppression was maximal (50.4%) at 10 microM AjA (P<0.05 vs untreated controls, N=7). AjA did not influence TNFalpha gene expression in or secretion from PBM. Reduction of IL-1beta by AjA may help explain the therapeutic effects of AjA in the animal model of arthritis. Development of nonpsychoactive therapeutically useful synthetic analogs of Cannabis constituents, such as AjA, may help resolve the ongoing debate about the use of marijuana as medicine.
The aim of this study was to determine whether topical application of capsaicin cream causes thermal allodynia and the extent to which this is attenuated by the addition of glyceryltrinitrate (GTN). This was a double blind placebo controlled study of 40 consenting adult subjects. Each of four cream combinations (GTN, capsaicin, GTN/capsaicin and vehicle) were applied to the subjects with at least a 1 day interval between each application. Water at a known temperature was applied to the standard area of skin where cream had been applied. Subjects rated the resulting thermal allodynia using a 0-10 Likhert score. Thermal allodynia is usually apparent when warm water is applied to skin containing capsaicin. The thermal allodynia caused by the topical application of capsaicin was significantly reduced by the addition of GTN. The addition of GTN to capsaicin cream significantly reduces the thermal allodynia associated with the application of capsaicin cream alone.
