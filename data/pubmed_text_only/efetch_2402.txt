Tumor growth appears to be an angiogenesis-dependent process. N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (fenretinide; 4HPR) has been found to inhibit and/or prevent tumor growth under diverse conditions. Although 4HPR is antiangiogenic, the molecular mechanisms of this effect remain largely unknown.
Endothelial cells were treated with 4HPR in vitro to study the effects on migration, invasion, and organization, as well as gene expression by microarray and quantitative PCR studies. In vivo angiogenesis was evaluated in the Matrigel model.
4HPR treatment substantially modified the biological activities of endothelial cells, repressing their capacity to migrate, invade, and organize into capillary-like structures. The inhibition of invasion induced by 4HPR was also associated with decreased activities of the metalloproteases matrix metalloproteinase-2 and CD13/APN. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we observed that bone morphogenetic protein-2 and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1, two multifunctional cytokines of the transforming growth factor-beta family that regulate the growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and matrix accumulation of a variety of cells, are up-regulated in vitro by 4HPR. Both these molecules specifically inhibited endothelial cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro and suppressed angiogenesis in the Matrigel plug assay in vivo. Blocking antibodies to bone morphogenetic protein-2 were able to reverse the suppressive effects of 4HPR in vitro and in vivo.
These data support the conclusion that 4HPR inhibits tumor growth by repression of new vessel growth and identify novel points of regulation of angiogenesis in transforming growth factor-beta family proteins.
The objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous diltiazem in the treatment of 37 patients with rapid (ventricular rate, mean +/- SD 142 +/- 17 beats/min) atrial fibrillation or flutter and moderate to severe congestive heart failure (ejection fraction, mean +/- SD 36 +/- 14%; New York Heart Association class III [23 patients], class IV [14 patients]). During the double-blind portion of the study, patients received either intravenous diltiazem, 0.25 mg/kg over 2 minutes, or placebo followed 15 minutes later by diltiazem or placebo, 0.35 mg/kg over 2 minutes, if the first dose was tolerated but ineffective. Placebo nonresponders were given open-label intravenous diltiazem in a similar fashion as in the double-blind portion of the study. In the double-blind part of the study, 21 (18 with 0.25 mg/kg, 3 with an additional 0.35 mg/kg) of the 22 patients (95%) responded to diltiazem, and 0 of 15 patients (0%) responded to placebo (p < 0.001). All 15 patients (13 with 0.25 mg/kg and 2 with an additional 0.35 mg/kg) who received placebo during the double-blind period had a therapeutic response to diltiazem during open-label therapy. Overall, 36 of 37 patients (97%) had a therapeutic response to intravenous diltiazem. Heart rate response to diltiazem after the 2-minute bolus infusions consisted of a > or = 20% decrease in heart rate from baseline in 36 patients; in addition, 17 patients also had heart rates decreased to < 100 beats/min, whereas no patient had conversion to sinus rhythm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
We have previously shown that the transcriptional inhibitor tetra-O-methyl nordihydroguaiaretic acid (M4N) induces growth arrest in tumor cells and exhibits tumoricidal activity when injected intratumorally into tumor cell explants in mice. The experiments reported here were designed to determine whether M(4)N can be given systemically and inhibit the growth of five different human xenograft tumors.
Nude (nu/nu) mice bearing xenografts of each of five human tumor types (i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma, Hep 3B; prostate carcinoma, LNCaP; colorectal carcinoma, HT-29; breast carcinoma, MCF7; and erythroleukemia, K-562) were treated with M4N given i.v. or i.p. in a Cremophor EL-based solvent system or orally in a corn oil based diet. Tumors from the treated animals were measured weekly and analyzed for the expression of the Cdc2 and survivin genes, both previously shown to be down-regulated by M4N.
Systemic M4N treatment suppressed the in vivo growth of xenografts in each of the five human tumor types. Four of the five tumor models were particularly sensitive to M4N with tumor growth inhibitions (T/C values) of < or = 42%, whereas the fifth, HT-29, responded to a lesser extent (48.3%). Growth arrest and apoptosis in both the xenograft tumors and in the tumor cells grown in culture were accompanied by reductions in both Cdc2 and tumor-specific survivin gene expression. Pharmacokinetic analysis following oral and i.v. administration to ICR mice indicated an absolute bioavailability for oral M4N of approximately 88%. Minimal drug-related toxicity was observed.
These preclinical studies establish that when given systemically, M4N can safely and effectively inhibit the growth of human tumors in nude mice.
Eleven postmenopausal women with Parkinson disease and levodopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesias underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The active treatment consisted of estrogen replacement therapy for 12 weeks, followed by medroxyprogesterone acetate for 2 weeks. Estrogen replacement therapy-medroxyprogesterone acetate administration significantly improved peak-dose dyskinesia without worsening motor disability, thus suggesting a possible benefit on dyskinesias in postmenopausal women with Parkinson disease.
In the reported Asian lamivudine trial, the rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, defined as HBeAg/hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA seroclearance and development of anti-HBe, during 52 weeks of treatment was only 13% to 16%. To evaluate whether any factors influenced HBeAg seroconversion, data from 345 patients in that trial were reanalyzed to correlate HBeAg seroconversion with variables including treatment, age, gender, body build, histology, baseline HBV-DNA levels, and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. Exploratory analysis using stepwise modeling revealed that HBeAg seroconversion correlated highly with pretherapy ALT (P <.001) followed by lamivudine therapy (P =.013), but only marginally with baseline HBV-DNA (P =.071) and cirrhosis (P =.066) for lamivudine 100 mg and placebo comparison. Among these four variables, only pretherapy ALT still had a highly significant (P <.001) correlation and lamivudine therapy had a borderline association (P =.066) for lamivudine 25 mg and placebo comparison. Categorical analysis revealed that HBeAg seroconversion occurred earlier and the cumulative rate was significantly higher in patients with pretherapy ALT values over 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) as compared with treated patients with lower ALT levels or untreated control patients with the same ALT levels (P <.001, respectively). The highest HBeAg seroconversion rate was observed in 100 mg lamivudine-treated patients with ALT levels greater than 5 times the ULN (64%) compared with patients with ALT 2 to 5 times the ULN (26%, P =.03); and ALT less than 2 times the ULN, (5%, P <.001). These results suggest that pretherapy ALT is the strongest determinant for HBeAg seroconversion during lamivudine therapy, and should be considered in selecting patients for treatment.
Hyperkalemia was commonly observed in successful renal transplant patients treated with cyclosporine and prednisone. At 1, 3 and 6 months after transplantation, 13 of 50, 9 of 50, and 5 of 50 patients, respectively, had serum concentrations of potassium greater than 5 mEq/1. This contrasts with the finding of hyperkalemia in only 1 of 13 comparable patients treated with azathioprine and prednisone. Mean serum concentrations of potassium at these dates were significantly higher in cyclosporine-treated patients than azathioprine-treated patients. The 2 patient groups had similar mean serum concentrations of chloride, bicarbonate and creatinine, and mean creatinine clearances at 1 and 3 months. Exposure to diuretic agents and antihypertensive agents was similar in the 2 groups. Serum concentrations of electrolytes and renal function data in hyperkalemic and normokalemic transplant patients receiving cyclosporine were similar. These observations suggest an association between cyclosporine administration and hyperkalemia in renal transplant recipients.
In a 4-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel study to compare the efficacy of cetirizine and astemizole, 47 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria were enrolled, with 19 cetirizine- and 17 astemizole-treated patients being taken into account for final analysis. Both treatment groups were comparable at initial visit. Giant weals, weals, erythema and oedema were improved in both treatment groups after treatment for 1-4 weeks. Patients' evaluation using a visual analogue scale and symptom scores assessed on a four-point scale showed that the improvement was significantly better using cetirizine for weals (P = 0.04) and there was a trend (P = 0.09) in favour of cetirizine for the visual analogue scale. The number and severity of side-effects were similar in both treatment groups.
Although head and neck cancer is a common malignancy, investigations have not yet improved the poor prognosis of patients. Therefore, it is important to find new cancer treatment modalities. Recent studies showed that cyclooxygenase, especially its isoform cyclooxygenase-2, is involved in tumorigenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. Inhibition of this enzyme by cyclooxygenase inhibitors has been shown to be antiproliferative in numerous cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to investigate if the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor nimesulide could enhance cytotoxicity of the standard chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Head and neck squamous cell cancer cells were incubated with nimesulide and/or cisplatin, and counted after 24, 48 and 72 h treatment. Visualization of apoptotic cells was done by immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that nimesulide inhibits the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in HNSCC cells. Therefore, COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide may not be a good partner for cisplatin in combination therapy for cancer.
Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and dexamethasone, are frequently prescribed medications sometimes associated with severe systemic side effects. Currently there are limited data regarding the psychiatric side effects of these medications, although mood changes and even psychoses have been reported. This study was designed to quantify psychiatric changes during brief courses of prednisone in patients with asthma. Outpatients with asthma (N = 32) receiving bursts of prednisone (>40 mg/day) were evaluated before, during, and after corticosteroid therapy by use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Young Mania Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Internal State Scale. A Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders was also conducted to examine past psychiatric history. Highly significant increases in the Young Mania Scale and Activation subscale of the Internal State Scale (both measures of mania) were observed with no increase in depression measures during the first 3 to 7 days of prednisone therapy. Mood changes were not correlated with improvement in airway obstruction, suggesting that mood elevations may not be in response to improvement in asthma symptoms. Subjects with past or current symptoms of depression had a significant decrease in depressive symptoms during prednisone therapy compared with those without depression. Some patients with posttraumatic stress disorder reported increases in depression and memories of the traumatic event during prednisone therapy. In summary, statistically significant changes in mood were observed even during brief courses of corticosteroids at modest dosages. The symptoms were primarily manic, not depressive. Persons with depression did not become more depressed during prednisone therapy, and, in fact, some showed improvement.
Paracetamol is regarded as a relatively safe drug in the gastro-duodenal region of humans but recent epidemiological investigations have suggested that at high doses there may be an increased risk of ulcers and bleeding. To investigate the possibility that inflammatory conditions and gastric acidity may play a role in potentiating development of gastric mucosal injury from paracetamol in rats (as noted previously with various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) we studied the gastric irritant effects of paracetamol and some phenolic and non-phenolic analgesics and antipyretics in rats with adjuvant or collagen II induced arthritis or zymosan-induced paw inflammation and given 1.0 ml hydrochloric acid (HCl) 0.1 M and/or an i. p. injection of the cholinomimetic, acetyl-beta-methyl choline chloride 5.0 mg/kg. Gastric lesions were determined 2 h after oral administration of 100 or 250 mg/kg paracetamol or at therapeutically effective doses of the phenolic or non-phenolic analgesics/antipyretics. The results showed that gastric mucosal injury occurred with all these agents when given to animals that received all treatments so indicating there is an adverse synergy of these three factors, namely: (i) intrinsic disease; (ii) hyperacidity; and (iii) vagal stimulation for rapidly promoting gastric damage, both in the fundic as well as the antral mucosa, for producing gastric damage by paracetamol, as well as the other agents. Removing one of these three predisposing factors effectively blunts/abolishes expression of this paracetamol-induced gastrotoxicity in rats. These three factors, without paracetamol, did not cause significant acute gastropathy.
Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that propoxyphene is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. Clinically significant sequelae have not been previously reported. We report a case of this inhibition manifested by life-threatening bradycardia in a patient receiving a CYP2D6 substrate, metoprolol. A 48-year-old man came to the emergency department complaining of dizziness 3 hours after ingesting metoprolol, at his usual dose, and 2 tablets of propoxyphene, newly begun postoperatively. Four hours after ingestion of both drugs, the patient was noted to have a ventricular rate of about 30 beats/min with underlying atrial fibrillation. The patient's ventricular response returned to normal within 11 hours of ingestion. We have demonstrated the clinical importance of the interaction between propoxyphene and metoprolol likely resulting from inhibition of hepatic clearance of metoprolol by propoxyphene. Underscoring the clinical relevance of CYP2D6 inhibition by an analgesic of questionable efficacy should proscribe its use.
Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) is caused by haploinsufficiency of GLI3 on 7p13. Features of GCPS include polydactyly, macrocephaly, and hypertelorism, and may be associated with cognitive deficits and abnormalities of the corpus callosum. GLI3 mutations in GCPS patients include point, frameshift, translocation, and gross deletion mutations. FISH and STRP analyses were applied to 34 patients with characteristics of GCPS. Deletions were identified in 11 patients and the extent of their deletion was determined. Nine patients with deletions had mental retardation (MR) or developmental delay (DD) and were classified as severe GCPS. These severe GCPS patients have manifestations that overlap with the acrocallosal syndrome (ACLS). The deletion breakpoints were analyzed in six patients whose deletions ranged in size from 151 kb to 10.6 Mb. Junction fragments were found to be distinct with no common sequences flanking the breakpoints. We conclude that patients with GCPS caused by large deletions that include GLI3 are likely to have cognitive deficits, and we hypothesize that this severe GCPS phenotype is caused by deletion of contiguous genes.
The authors reviewed reported cases of antibiotic-induced manic episodes by means of a MEDLINE and PsychLit search for reports of antibiotic-induced mania. Unpublished reports were requested from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Twenty-one reports of antimicrobial-induced mania were found in the literature. There were 6 cases implicating clarithromycin, 13 implicating isoniazid, and 1 case each implicating erythromycin and amoxicillin. The WHO reported 82 cases. Of these, clarithromycin was implicated in 23 (27.6%) cases, ciprofloxacin in 12 (14.4%) cases, and ofloxacin in 10 (12%) cases. Cotrimoxazole, metronidazole, and erythromycin were involved in 15 reported manic episodes. Cases reported by the FDA showed clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin to be the most frequently associated with the development of mania. Statistical analysis of the data would not have demonstrated a significant statistical correlative risk and was therefore not undertaken. Patients have an increased risk of developing mania while being treated with antimicrobials. Although this is not a statistically significant risk, physicians must be aware of the effect and reversibility. Further research clearly is required to determine the incidence of antimicrobial-induced mania, the relative risk factors of developing an antimicrobial-induced manic episode among various demographic populations, and the incidence of patients who continue to have persistent affective disorders once the initial episode, which occurs while the patient is taking antibiotics, subsides. The authors elected to name this syndrome "antibiomania."
The potential induction of cardiac effects by high-dose dexamethasone therapy was evaluated prospectively in 13 respirator-dependent infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia by means of two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography. The initial divided dose of dexamethasone was 500 micrograms/kg per day, tapered progressively for as long as 6 weeks. Evaluations were made before treatment and at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days after the start of dexamethasone therapy. This regimen was associated with a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in thickness of the interventricular septum (2.60 +/- 0.09 to 4.00 +/- 0.16 mm), diastolic left ventricular free wall (2.80 +/- 0.13 to 4.06 +/- 0.20 mm), and diastolic right ventricular free wall (1.55 +/- 0.08 to 2.02 +/- 0.12 mm). In addition, seven dexamethasone-treated infants but no control infants had systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (p less than 0.001). These effects were transient, reached their maximal degree by the third week of treatment, and approached pretreatment conditions by the sixth week of treatment. Ejection fraction was not affected; heart rate and mean arterial pressure were transiently increased during dexamethasone therapy. We conclude that a transient absolute myocardial hypertrophy is associated with dexamethasone therapy in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The mechanism or mechanisms through which this hypertrophy arises and the cardiopulmonary implications are unclear.
Residual paralysis following the use of neuromuscular blocking drugs remains a clinical problem. As part of departmental quality assurance, we examined the degree of postoperative residual curarization (PORC) following atracurium.
Forty patients undergoing general anaesthesia involving atracurium were studied. Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring (mechanomyography, Myograph 2000, Biometer, Denmark) was performed by assessing the response to supramaximal train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve. Anaesthesia was provided by non-participating clinicians who were blinded to the study data. A TOF ratio </=0.7 at extubation was classified as PORC.
At antagonism of neuromuscular block, 70% (28/40) of patients had a TOF ratio </=0.7, and 65% (26/40) of patients had a TOF ratio </=0.7 at extubation. Peripheral nerve stimulator use was associated with a longer interval from antagonism of block to extubation (P=0.01), but was not associated with differences in atracurium dosage or a reduction in PORC at extubation. Patients with TOF ratio </=0.7 at extubation had surgery of shorter duration [59 (SEM 6) vs 103 (9) min, P<0.001], greater doses of atracurium relative to the duration of surgery [6 (1) vs 11 (1) micro g kg(-1) min(-1), P<0.005], and shorter intervals from administration of last dose of atracurium to antagonism of neuromuscular block [29 (2) vs 53 (9) min, P<0.005] and from antagonism to extubation [6 (1) vs 15 (4) min, P<0.01]. Duration of surgical procedure was the sole multivariate predictor of PORC [odds ratio 0.94 (95% confidence intervals 0.91-0.98), P<0.01].
PORC remains a clinical problem despite use of intermediate-duration neuromuscular blocking drugs and peripheral nerve stimulators. Patients undergoing procedures of short duration may be at risk of inappropriately early tracheal extubation, possibly due to work pressures. The association between suboptimal antagonism of neuromuscular blockade and short procedures needs reinforcement during postgraduate training and departmental quality assurance.
Idiopathic congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) has been linked to autonomic nervous system dysregulation and/or dysfunction (ANSD) since it was first described in 1970. A genetic basis of CCHS has been proposed because of the reports of four families with two affected children, because of mother-child transmission, and because of a recent report of a polyalanine expansion mutation in PHOX2b in a subset of CCHS subjects. We, therefore, studied genes pertinent to early embryologic development of the ANS including mammalian achaete-scute homolog-1 (MASH1), bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP2), engrailed-1 (EN1), TLX3, endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE1), endothelin-1 (EDN1), PHOX2a, and PHOX2b in 67 probands with CCHS, and gender- and ethnicity-matched controls. No disease-defining mutations were identified in MASH1, BMP2, EN1, TLX3, ECE1, EDN1, or PHOX2a. The 65/67 CCHS probands (97%) were found to be heterozygous for the exon 3 polyalanine expansion mutation identified previously in PHOX2b. Further, there was an association between repeat mutation length and severity of the CCHS/ANSD phenotype. Of the two probands who did not carry the expansion mutation, one had a nonsense mutation in exon 3 which truncated the protein and the other had no mutation in PHOX2b but had a previously reported EDN3 frameshift point mutation. The polyalanine expansion mutation was not found in any of 67 matched controls. Of 54 available families (including 97 unaffected parents), whose child carried the PHOX2b mutation, 4 parents demonstrated mosaicism for an expansion mutation identical to that seen in the CCHS cases, suggesting that not all mutations in affected probands with unaffected parents are de novo. We also studied four women with CCHS who were heterozygous for the PHOX2b mutation, each with one child. Three of the four children were also affected and had the same mutation, demonstrating autosomal dominant inheritance of the mutation. Assay of the PHOX2b polyalanine repeat mutation represents a highly sensitive and specific technique for confirming the diagnosis of CCHS. Identification of the CCHS mutation will lead to clarification of the phenotype, allow for prenatal diagnosis for parents of CCHS probands and adults with CCHS in future pregnancies, and potentially direct intervention strategies for the treatment of CCHS.
Inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, Pendred syndrome is a disease that shows congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goiter, with a positive finding in the perchlorate discharge test. Pendred syndrome results from various mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene that cause production of an abnormal pendrin protein. More than 90 mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene have been reported throughout the world. A recent study of 26 Korean patients with a relatively high frequency (65%) of a mutated PDS/SLC26A4 gene exhibited nonsyndromic deafness and an enlarged vestibular aqueduct. We report two patients with characteristics of typical Pendred syndrome, a 26-yr-old female and a 61-yr-old male, who were both homozygous for a previously reported missense mutation, H723R (Histidine 723Arginine) in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene.
Gastro-oesophageal reflux is a common clinical disorder associated with a variety of respiratory symptoms, including chronic cough and exacerbation of asthma. In this study, the potential role of acid-induced tachykinin release was examined in guinea pigs and rabbits, by examining the effects of the tachykinin NK1 and NK3 receptors antagonists (SR 140333 and SR 142801, respectively) (1-10 mg x kg(-1)) on plasma protein extravasation induced in airways by hydrochloric acid (HCl) infusion in the oesophagus. Guinea pigs were anaesthetised with urethane, while rabbits were subject to neuroleptoanalgesia with hypnorm. Airway vascular leakage was evaluated by measuring extravasation of Evans blue dye. All animals were pretreated with atropine (1 mg x kg(-1) i.p.), propranolol (1 mg x kg(-1) i.p.), phosphoramidon (2.5 mg x kg(-1) i.v.) and saline or tachykinin receptor antagonists (1-10 mg x kg(-1) i.p.). Infusion of 1 N HCl into the oesophagus led to a three- and five-fold increase in plasma extravasation in the main bronchi and trachea, respectively. This increase was largely prevented by the tachykinin NK1 and NK3 receptor antagonists SR 140333 and SR 142801 (1-10 mg x kg(-1)). These results suggest that protein extravasation in the airways, as induced by intraoesophageal HCl infusion, is mainly dependent on the release of tachykinins, and that both NK1 and NK3 tachykinin receptors are involved. The results suggest that HCl-induced sensory nerve stimulation may act in the periphery on intermediate neurons and/or ganglia where NK3 receptors have been shown to play an important role.
A number of second line treatments have been proposed in patients with advanced pretreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, either single agents or two or three drug combinations achieved very poor results with no superiority of any combination over monotherapy. We have treated 42 patients (30 males) affected by advanced/metastatic NSCLC progressing during front line cisplatin-based chemotherapy with a combination of topotecan (1.2 mg/m2) plus ifosfamide (1200 mg/m2) for 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks. The median age was 63 years (range 43-76); cell types were: squamous carcinoma (n=17), adenocarcinoma (n=16), large cell carcinoma (n=3), broncho-alveolar carcinoma (n=2) and undifferentiated carcinoma (n=4). All patients were treated with a platinum containing chemotherapy: 39 patients with cisplatin, 2 patients with carboplatin and 1 patient with oxaliplatin, respectively. The ECOG PS was 0 in 8 patients (19%), 1 in 11 patients (26%), and 2 in 23 patients (55%). The median number of courses administered was 3 (range 1-8). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was the dose limiting toxicity, observed in 36% of patients. Moreover, grade 3-4 anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 17% and in 12% of patients, respectively. One PS 2 patient died of grade 4 hematological toxicity after the first cycle. No complete response was observed. Six (14.2%) subjects obtained a partial response (PR). In addition, 1 (2.4%) minimal response (MR) plus 14 (34%) stable diseases (SD) and 21 (51%) progressive diseases (PD) were observed. Median time to disease progression and median survival were 9 weeks (range 1-13) and 26 weeks (range 1-91+), respectively. The 1-year survival rate was 14%. Combination of topotecan and ifosfamide demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with relapsing or refractory NCSLC with a modest side effect profile and an overall disease control (PR + MR + SD) of 50.7%. Nevertheless, the still low response rate and the shortness of median survival indicates the need for more effective second line treatments in this disease.
An experimental rat model for the study of venous pain induced by 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide (4-OH-CP) derivatives was developed and validated. Using various metabolites and chemical variants of 4-OH-CP it was found that pain induction was independent from the compound's alkylating activity but possibly related to the spontaneous generation of minute amounts of acrolein from the 4-OH-CP molecule. Accordingly, the pain could be prevented by the addition of thiol compounds such as mesna or N-acetyl-cysteine.
The effects of a new inhaled antimuscarinic drug, oxitropium bromide, and of a slow-release theophylline preparation upon nocturnal asthma were compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind study. Two samples were studied: 12 patients received oxitropium at 600 micrograms (6 subjects) or at 400 micrograms t.i.d. (6 subjects) whereas 11 received theophylline at 300 mg b.i.d. Morning dipping, assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight, was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken, whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration. No significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug, as well as with either dosage of oxitropium. No subject reported side effects of oxitropium, as compared to three subjects reporting nausea, vomiting and tremors after theophylline. Oxitropium proves to be a valuable alternative to theophylline in nocturnal asthma, since it is equally potent, safer and does not require the titration of dosage.
A 14-day-old infant received intravenous lidocaine (2 mg X kg-1) at the conclusion of cataract surgery to prevent coughing from tracheal tube stimulation. Within 30 seconds the infant developed high-grade AV heart block and a ventricular rate of 40. Following brief resuscitation efforts, the patient had a normal cardiac rhythm, blood pressure and respiratory pattern. Intravenous lidocaine may be followed by major disturbances in cardiac rhythm and rate. Cautious titration of small doses should decrease the potential for adverse effects.
