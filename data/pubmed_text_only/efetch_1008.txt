The intraperitoneal administration of benzene produced marked increases in mouse striatal concentrations of beta-phenylethylamine, p-tyramine and, to a lesser extent, m-tyramine. Similar increases were observed in rat striatal p- and m-tyramine. The subcutaneous administration of benzene dissolved in sesame oil increased mouse striatal p-tyramine but did not change m-tyramine. Benzene administration to mice pretreated with p-tyrosine produced marked increases in mouse striatal p-tyramine as well as in m-tyramine. The statistical analysis of the results indicated that the treatment produced an interaction that led to an increase in the concentration of both the p- and m-isomers of tyramine. The administration of benzene to m-tyrosine-pretreated mice increased striatal m-tyramine but p-tyramine was not increased. The treatment produced no potentiation in the formation of p- or m-tyramine. Of the other organic solvents given, pyridine produced the most marked effects. Its administration increased the concentration of both p- and m-tyramine in the mouse striatum. Treatment with toluene, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or isoamylalcohol produced moderate increases in mouse striatal p-tyramine while toluene, dichloromethane or isobutylalcohol also increased m-tyramine. These increases in brain beta-phenylethylamine, p-tyramine and m-tyramine may play a contributory role in the human toxicity of benzene and some of these organic solvents; these toxic effects could be exacerbated after ingestion of foodstuffs containing the aminoacids phenylalanine or p-tyrosine or for those under treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.
In this study, we investigated the possibility that the adrenal gland contributes to nicotine-induced pulmonary hypertension using a canine left lower lung lobe (LLL) preparation that was pump-perfused with mixed venous blood at constant flow and outflow pressure. Main pulmonary artery, left atrial, and LLL arterial pressures were monitored to assess the responses of the animal's intact right lung and isolated LLL. With the adrenal venous return intact, injection of 10-26 micrograms/kg nicotine into the left ventricle or ascending aorta resulted in a 42% increase in LLL arterial pressure and a 70% increase in the pulmonary arterial-left atrial pressure gradient (Ppa-Pla). When the adrenal venous return was interrupted, the increases in LLL arterial pressure and Ppa-Pla were reduced to 6 and 10%, respectively. The LLL response could be eliminated by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade, suggesting that adrenal catecholamines may contribute to the pulmonary hypertension induced by nicotine infusion.
Activating mutations in the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) gene corresponding to N-terminal phosphorylation sites in the protein have been implicated in the development of human colon cancer. To determine the possible involvement of such mutations during chemically induced colon carcinogenesis, we examined the corresponding region of Ctnnb1 in colon tumors induced in the F344 rat by two cooked meat heterocyclic amines, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). All of the colon tumors induced by 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline that were examined (5 of 5) and 4 of 7 PhIP-induced colon tumors had mutations within or flanking codons corresponding to important phosphorylation sites in beta-catenin. None of the colon tumors bearing Ctnnb1 mutations had genetic changes in the Apc gene, and those that contained wild-type Ctnnb1 were known from our previous work to contain Apc mutations. The results provide evidence for a major role of the beta-catenin/Apc pathway in the development of heterocyclic amine-induced colon tumors and give further weight to the view that regulation of beta-catenin is critical to the tumor suppressive effects of Apc during colon carcinogenesis. In contrast, Ctnnb1 mutations were completely absent in 23 PhIP-induced mammary tumors, in accordance with recent work showing that human breast carcinomas lack mutations in CTNNB1.
MicroRNA biogenesis genes have been confirmed involved in lots of diseases. This study evaluated the role of genetic variants in microRNA biogenesis genes in semen quality and idiopathic male infertility. Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of DICER1 (rs13078, rs1057035 and rs12323635) and DROSHA (rs10719, rs2291109, rs17409893 and rs642321) were determined by TaqMan probes and SNPstream in 667 eligible infertile men and 419 fertile controls. Semen quality analysis was performed by computer-assisted sperm analysis. It was found that genetic variants of rs12323635 was associated with idiopathic male infertility. Additionally, in strategy analysis, the rs12323635 C allele might decrease the risk of oligozoospermia (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.66; P=0.0002). The rs642321 TT genotype may have a higher risk of oligozoospermia (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.34-4.25; P=0.003). These significant differences were retained after Bonferroni correction. The results showed that variants of DICER1 and DROSHA may modify the risk of abnormal semen parameters, which could result in male infertility. MicroRNA have been confirmed involved in lots of diseases. To our knowledge, few studies have elucidated the role of genetic variants in microRNA biogenesis genes in semen quality and idiopathic male infertility, although microRNA is indispensable in normal spermatogenesis. In this original study, we evaluated the potential impact of the polymorphisms in microRNA biogenesis genes on the risk of abnormal semen quality based on 667 infertile patients and 419 controls, and provided the first evidence that polymorphism in rs12323635 in DICER1 may modify the risk of abnormal semen parameters, which could result in male infertility.
Cholestatic jaundice induced by hepatic intra-arterial 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) demonstrated marked improvement in three patients following treatment with oral corticosteroids. Subsequent "prophylactic" use allowed continuation of chemotherapy and improved quality of life. Corticosteroid use in selected patients with FUDR-induced cholestatic jaundice may be beneficial.
A case of cerebral vasculitis in a previously healthy 22-year-old man with a history of cocaine abuse is described. Cerebral angiograms showed evidence of vasculitis. A search for possible causes other than cocaine produced no results. We now include cocaine with methamphetamines, heroin, and ephedrine as illicit drugs that can cause cerebral vasculitis.
The objectives of this study were to characterize raltegravir (RAL) population pharmacokinetics in HIV-positive (HIV(+)) and healthy individuals, identify influential factors, and search for new candidate genes involved in UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-mediated glucuronidation. The pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with NONMEM. Genetic association analysis was performed with PLINK using the relative bioavailability as the phenotype. Simulations were performed to compare once- and twice-daily regimens. A 2-compartment model with first-order absorption adequately described the data. Atazanavir, gender, and bilirubin levels influenced RAL relative bioavailability, which was 30% lower in HIV(+) than in healthy individuals. UGT1A9*3 was the only genetic variant possibly influencing RAL pharmacokinetics. The majority of RAL pharmacokinetic variability remains unexplained by genetic and nongenetic factors. Owing to the very large variability, trough drug levels might be very low under the standard dosing regimen, raising the question of a potential relevance of therapeutic drug monitoring of RAL in some situations.
Around 60% of mice homozygous for the curly-tail gene have neural tube defects (NTD). F1 hybrids between curly-tail mice (ct) and a nongenetically predisposed A strain (A) do not have NTD. Vitamin A increases the penetrance of the ct gene at doses that hardly cause any NTD in A mice. The susceptibility to vitamin A of the F1 hybrids, derived from ct female X A male and A female X ct male crosses, was examined. Either 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg was injected into the mother on the eighth day of pregnancy. The F1 hybrids did develop NTD, and there was a dose response. The number with NTD was roughly intermediate between that found in the two pure parental crosses. However, there was a significant difference in response according to whether the ct or the A was the mother, more F1 embryos having NTD in the former situation. Also, significantly more of the female F1 hybrids had NTD when the ct was the mother than when the A was the mother, but for the males, the number with NTD was the same in both crosses. The number of intrauterine deaths of F1 hybrids, seen as resorptions in each reciprocal cross, was not intermediate but matched that of the pure parental strain of the mother involved in the hybrid cross. It is concluded that gene-environment interaction has been demonstrated, together with both a maternal effect and a contribution of the fetal genotype in the liability to produce NTD in response to vitamin A.
In the quantitative electron microscopic study, we examined the relationship of desmosomes to tumor invasiveness in chemical carcinogen (N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide)-induced urinary bladder transitional cell carcinomas in the Fischer rat. The number of a desmosomes per unit area of plasma membrane was significantly reduced in carcinomas. However, the percentage of cell surface area occupied by desmosomes was greater in carcinomas than in controls. This was accounted for on the basis of increases in desmosomal size, which result from squamous differentiation within the tumors. Areas of transitional cell differentiation and squamous differentiation demonstrated an equal capacity for invasiveness. Desmosomes were abundant in invading nests of tumor cells. These findings cast doubt on the validity of the concept of decreased intercellular adhesion as a prerequisite for tumor invasion, since strong interadhesion is probably a function of the area occupied by the intercellular junctions.
Serious hematologic complications associated with ticlopidine have been reported, including aplastic anemia. We report here an additional case of fatal aplastic anemia due to ticlopidine. A 66-year-old male patient developed fever and pancytopenia 2 months after ticlopidine was started. Despite the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and broad-spectrum antibiotics, as well as aggressive red cell and platelet transfusions, the patient died 16 days after admission due to septic shock. Eighteen other cases of ticlopidine-induced aplastic anemia published in the English literature are also reviewed and presented here. Eight of the total 19 patients (including the one reported here) have died, mostly due to infection. Of the seven who received supportive treatment only, four had spontaneous recovery. Nine cases were treated with G-CSF or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and response was observed in only four of them. Several other cases were treated with high-dose corticosteroids or androgens; however, it was not possible to evaluate the efficacy of these treatments because of the limited number of cases. In the absence of satisfactory treatment for ticlopidine-induced aplastic anemia at present, it may be reasonable to try antilymphocyte globulin or cyclosporine. Also, great efforts should be made in the prevention and management of infection accompanying this disease.
Lung N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) may cause excitotoxic pulmonary edema if activated. Acute lung injury may be mediated by oxidative stress, frequently generated by local or remote ischemia and reperfusion (IR). This experimental study assessed the effects of intravenous dextromethorphan, an NMDAR antagonist, on reperfusion lung injury following superior mesenteric artery (SMA) clamping/unclamping. SMA of 48 (12 per group) anesthetized adult male Wistar rats was clamped for 90 min (IR); 48 additional rats underwent a sham laparotomy (control). The experimental timeframe was identical in all groups. Ten minutes before unclamping, three dextromethorphan doses were administered intravenously in three IR and three control groups, followed by 3 h of respiratory and hemodynamic assessment and postexperimental assessment of survival. Intravenous 10 and 20 mg/kg dextromethorphan attenuated an 85% increase in peak ventilatory pressure, a 45% reduction in PO(2)/FiO(2), 4-12-fold increase in bronchoalveolar lavage-retrieved volume, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes/bronchoalveolar cells ratio, all associated with SMA unclamping in the IR-nontreated and the IR-40 mg/kg dextromethorphan-treated rats. Lung tissue polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, total xanthine oxidase activity, reduced glutathione, and wet-to-dry weight ratio were all within normal ranges in the two lower-dose-treated groups. These effective regimens were also associated with longer postexperimental animal survival. Dextromethorphan was not associated with changes in three control groups. Thus, Intravenous dextromethorphan mitigates lung reperfusion injury following SMA clamping/unclamping in a dose-dependent manner. This is a novel potential use of dextromethorphan in vivo.
Nasal-type NK/T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a unique subtype with the manifestation of local necrosis, infection and fever. The efficacy of chemotherapy alone is unsatisfactory; while radiochemotherapy plays some roles in the management of NK/T-cell lymphoma (NK/TCL). This study was to summarize the clinical characteristics, treatment outcome and prognosis of NK/TCL patients.
Records of 93 patients with NK/TCL from Jan. 1997 to Jun. 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were classified according to WHO classification system.
Of the 93 patients, 75 (80.6%) were in stage I-II, and 18 (19.4%) were in stage III-IV. The most common symptoms were nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis. The disease course was 1-24 months with a median of 6.5 months. Of the 93 patients, 15 (16.1%) presented perforation of hard palate and/or nasal septum, 35 (37.6%) presented B symptoms; 35 (37.6%) were treated with chemotherapy alone, 2 (2.2%) were treated with radiotherapy alone, 54 (58.0%) were treated with radiochemotherapy, and 2 (2.2%) received no treatment. The first-line chemotherapy regimens were mainly CHOP and EPOCH. The overall response rate (RR) was 84.4% (76/90) with complete remission (CR) rate of 64.4% (58/90). The response rate of chemotherapy alone group was 67.6% (23/34) with CR rate of 41.2% (14/34). The response rate of combined modality group was 94.4% (51/54) with CR rate of 83.3% (45/54). The 2 patients who received no treatment died within 6 months. The major toxicity of chemotherapy was myelosuppression. The prevalence of grade III-IV neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were 37.7%, 13.7%, and 10.7%. The major toxicities of radiotherapy were grade I-II mucosa lesion and myelosuppression. Other toxicities were mild. The mortality was 66.7% (62/93). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 63.4%, 43.1%, and 17.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that perforation of hard palate and/or nasal septum, B symptoms and therapeutic modality were independent prognostic factors of NK/TCL (P=0.035, P<0.001, and P=0.004).
NK/TCL has low chemotherapy sensitivity. Although combined chemoradiotherapy yield better outcome, the long-term survival was still poor. Investigation of optional treatment is needed.
The link between specific personality profiles and a single psychotropic drug of choice is still unclear and only partially explored. The present study compares three groups of male subjects: 85 patients manifesting heroin dependence (age: 30.07 +/- 2.78), 60 patients manifesting cocaine dependence (age: 31.96 +/- 3.1), and 50 healthy subjects from a random population sample (age: 33.25 +/- 1.45). The patients included in the study showed a long-lasting history of dependence on heroin or cocaine, respectively, 5.2 +/- 2.5 years, 4.6 +/- 2.9 years, and were stabilized in treatment, and abstinent, at least 4 weeks at the time of the diagnostic assessment. Heroin addicts (52.90%) were on methadone maintenance treatment. Cocaine addicts (11.60%) were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Personality traits were measured by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) and Cloninger's Three-dimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). Character and quantification of aggressiveness were measured by the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI). Heroin-dependent patients (group A) scored significantly higher on hysteria, masculine-feminine and social introversion subscales of the MMPI, and significantly lower on the harm avoidance (HA) subscale of the TPQ than cocaine addicts. In contrast, scores on the MMPI for hypochondria, psychopathic deviance, and paranoia dimensions were more elevated in cocaine addicts than in heroin-dependent patients. Cocaine addicts scored higher than heroin addicts on the "direct" aggressiveness subscale and on the BDHI total score. Cocaine addicts did not differ from healthy controls on harm avoidance (behavioral control). Although cocaine addicts showed more consistent psychopathic deviance and overt aggressiveness than heroin addicts, higher harm avoidance (behavioral control), hypochondria (or worry about their health), and social extroversion may reduce their proneness to overt antisocial behavior and allow relatively higher levels of social integration. The study's limitations are noted.
Intra-nasally instilled benzodiazepines have been proposed for acute anxiety episodes. However, routes with faster absorption may increase abuse liability. This study compared abuse liability of intra-nasal midazolam between subjects with a history of intra-nasal drug abuse and non-psychiatric subjects on a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Thirty-one inhaled-cocaine abusers and 34 normal volunteers received either 1 mg intra-nasal midazolam or active placebo. Visual analogue scales assessing desire to repeat the experience (ER) and Experience Liking (EL) assessed abuse liability. Profile analysis for repeated measures showed a significant effect of time over ER (F([5,57])=3.311, p=0.011) and EL (F([5,57])=3.947, p=0.004), diagnostic group (cocaine abusers scoring higher on both - F([5,57])=5.229, p=0.026; F([5,57])=4.946, p=0.030), regardless of the administered substance. It is concluded that the intra-nasal route does not seem to pose risks for non-psychiatric individuals, but it may represent a risk in itself for subjects with a history of drug abuse through this path.
In a retrospective study we sought to dissect the factors associated with an increased occurrence of clinically significant perinephric fluid collections and lymphoceles among sirolimus-treated renal transplant recipients.
We compared the incidence, predisposing factors, and consequences of these fluid collections among patients treated with sirolimus-cyclosporine (CsA)-prednisone (Pred) (n=354, group I) versus CsA-Pred with or without azathioprine (n=136, group II).
More group I patients (135/354; 38.1%) displayed perinephric fluid collections (denoted as group III) then group II patients (24/136; 17.6%) (denoted as group IV) (P <0.001). In both subgroups the serum creatinine levels were elevated at the time of diagnosis from a nadir of 2.04+/-1.61 to 4.09+/-2.95 mg/dL (group III) and from 2.53+/-2.34 to 4.36+/-2.90 mg/dL (group IV). A significantly greater number of patients required treatment for lymphoceles among group I (56/354; 15.8%) versus group II recipients (6/136; 4.4%; P<0.001). Single or repeated percutaneous drainage procedures successfully treated 35 group I patients versus all 6 group IV patients (P =0.033). No patients in group II versus 21 patients in group I underwent surgical procedures (P <0.001). A significantly higher rate and higher histologic grade of acute rejection episodes, particularly proximate to the onset of the lymphocele, occurred among group IV patients, namely 54.2% (13/24) versus 21.4% (29/135) group III patients (P <0.001).
Addition of sirolimus to a CsA-Pred regimen resulted in both a higher incidence and a requirement for more aggressive treatment of perinephric fluid collections and lymphoceles.
Thromboxane A2 is a proaggregative vasoconstrictor that is synthesized and released in reperfusion injury. We aimed to investigate the effects of thromboxane synthase inhibitor, UK 38485, on endothelin-1,2 (ET) response of the renal endothelium and lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in the early period of kidney transplantation. Four groups (n=8 in group IV and n=10 in the others) [corrected] of Sprague-Dawley rats were designed as Group I (sham nephrectomy), Group II (autotransplantation), Group III (allotransplantation) and Group IV (allotransplantation group in which the allografts were perfused with UK 38485. All subjects underwent right nephrectomy after transplantation. The grafts were flushed with 4 ml of ice-cold Ringer's lactate and in Group IV 10 microg of UK 38485 was added into the solution for each kidney. In allotransplantation groups, the kidneys were harvested from allogeneic white Wistar albino rats. The kidney grafts were allowed 120 min of reperfusion after 40 min of cold ischemic period. ET-1,2 plasma concentrations in the renal vein blood and diene conjugates (DC), hydroxyalkanals (HAA), hydroxyalkenals (HAE) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as the products of lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls and protein sulfhydryls as the indicators of protein oxidation were analyzed in kidney tissue. Plasma ET-1,2 concentrations increased significantly in Group II and Group III (P<0.01) when compared to Group I but decreased in Group IV in comparison with Group III (P<0.05). DC, HAA, HAE and MDA levels increased in Groups II and III (P<0.001). Significant protein oxidation occurred only in Group III (P<0.01). Perfusion of the allografts with UK 38485 prevented lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in Group IV. Histopathological changes were mild in the last group. We concluded that, in kidney transplantation, local administration of UK 38485 has cytopreservative effects on the allografts and this effect can be related to ET-1,2 concentrations.
Cocaine withdrawal symptoms are thought to play a role in relapse; studies characterizing the symptomatology have yielded mixed findings. This study sought to examine the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic profile of repeated high dose exposure to oral cocaine and characterize acute and protracted withdrawal in cocaine abusers. This study employed a repeated-dosing, single-blind design in which subjects (n = 9), resided for 40 days on a closed ward. They were maintained for two 4-day cocaine exposure periods (Days 1-4 & Days 9-12, cocaine 175 mg, p.o.; 5 hourly doses; 875 mg/day) separated by a 4-day matched placebo exposure period (Days 5-8). After these 12 days, an additional period of 28 days of placebo maintenance followed (Days 13-40). Test sessions were conducted during each phase; measures of mood, drug effects, sleep, pharmacokinetics, and prolactin were collected throughout the study. The dosing regimen produced cocaine plasma concentrations (Cmax of 680 ng/mL) two to threefold higher than typically seen in acute dose studies. Prototypic psychostimulant effects, including subjective ratings of euphoric effects (liking, high, good effects) and significant cardiopressor effects, were sustained during the active dosing periods, corresponding to the rise and fall of plasma cocaine. Withdrawal-like symptoms (i.e., disruptions of sleep, increased ratings of anxiety, irritability, crashing) were observed within 24-hr after cessation of dosing. Cocaine reduced prolactin acutely, but no sustained alterations were observed for this measure or for other signs or symptoms during the 28-day abstinence period. These findings indicate that exposure to controlled high doses of cocaine produces modest symptoms consistent with cocaine withdrawal within hours of cessation of dosing but provide no evidence of symptoms persisting beyond 24 hours.
The teratogenic effects of endrin and lindane have been determined and compared to those induced by TCDD in the fetuses of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice after the administration of single oral doses to pregnant mice on day 12 of gestation. TCDD produced dose-dependent decreases in fetal weight, fetal thymic weight and placental weight, and dose-dependent increases in fetolethality, cleft palate formation and hydronephrosis at doses of 10-30 and 30-60 micrograms/kg body weight in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, respectively. No maternal death was observed at the given doses in both strains of mice. Endrin (4.5 and 6 mg/kg body weight) and lindane (30 and 45 mg/kg body weight) produced significant decreases in fetal weight and placental weight in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, and dose-dependent decreases in fetal thymic weight in C57BL/6J mice but not DBA/2J mice. Endrin and lindane caused 0-25 and 14-25% maternal deaths, respectively, at the above mentioned doses. Neither cleft plate nor hydronephrosis were induced by endrin or lindane in the two strains of mice. The results support the hypothesis that TCDD-induced cleft plate and hydronephrosis involve mechanisms that are Ah (aryl hydrocarbon) receptor mediated. However, other fetotoxic effects induced by TCDD, and the fetotoxic effects induced by endrin and lindane may involve additional unknown mechanisms that are not related to the Ah-receptor.
During a 12-week intervention, opioid dependent participants (N = 120) maintained on thrice-a-week (M, W, F) buprenorphine plus therapist and computer-based counseling were randomized to receive: (a) medication contingencies (MC = thrice weekly dosing schedule vs. daily attendance and single-day 50% dose reduction imposed upon submission of an opioid and/or cocaine positive urine sample); (b) voucher contingency (VC = escalating schedule for opioid and/or cocaine negative samples with reset for drug-positive samples); or (c) standard care (SC), with no programmed consequences for urinalysis results. VC resulted in better 12-week retention (85%) compared to MC (58%; p = 0.009), but neither differed from SC (76% retained). After adjusting for baseline differences in employment, and compared to SC, the MC group achieved 1.5 more continuous weeks of combined opioid/cocaine abstinence (p = 0.030), while the VC group had 2 more total weeks of abstinence (p = 0.048). Drug use results suggest that both the interventions were efficacious, with effects primarily in opioid rather than cocaine test results. Findings should be interpreted in light of the greater attrition associated with medication-based contingencies versus the greater monetary costs of voucher-based contingencies.
The decision for an anticoagulant for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with acute renal failure and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has to be made carefully. Based on results from the literature argatroban is favoured in patients without hepatic dysfunction, referring to its short halftime and easy feasable monitoring. In the case of coexsisting hepatic disorder, danaparoid provides a safe alternative therapy. However, long halftime and the difficult elimination of the substance are unfavourable. Lepirudin represents another possible anticoagulant therapy. Bleeding complications and monitoring of the ecarin clotting time imposes limitations. Experiences with bivalirudin, fondaparinux and prostaglandines are limited and future trials will have to determine the significance of their application in RRT in HIT patients. Furthermore it has to be proven whether the combination of alternative anticoagulants with citrate prolongates circuit halftime of CVVH.
Syncopal attacks in patients with bifascicular block may be due to both ventricular tachyarrhythmias and intermittent atrioventricular block in addition to non-cardiac causes and lead to antiarrhythmic treatment with drugs or pacemaker or both. The acute electrophysiological effect of intravenous disopyramide 2 mg/kg body weight given over five minutes on the His-Purkinje system was assessed in 27 patients with chronic bifascicular block undergoing evaluation for permanent pacemaker treatment. The predictive value of this pharmacological stress test as regards the development of atrioventricular block during follow up was analysed. The HV interval increased (mean 43%) and the QRS duration was prolonged (mean 24%). Intrahisian or infrahisian second or third degree atrioventricular block occurred in 14 patients after disopyramide administration, requiring temporary pacing in four of them. Before the electrophysiological study 15 of the 27 patients had had at least two syncopal attacks of suspected cardiac origin but no evidence of second or third degree atrioventricular block. Second or third degree atrioventricular block was subsequently recorded in five of these 15 patients during a mean of two years follow up. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of second or third degree atrioventricular block produced by disopyramide administration including subsequent atrial pacing--a positive disopyramide test--as regards later development of atrioventricular block were 80%, 90%, and 80% respectively. Intravenous administration of disopyramide to patients with bifascicular block and syncopal attacks of suspected cardiac origin may provoke atrioventricular block and asystole requiring immediate temporary pacing. Furthermore, a positive disopyramide test seems to have a significant value in predicting the later development of atrioventricular block.
Some reports suggest that activation of the autonomic nervous system by bupivacaine could participate in its cardiotoxicity. This is based in part on the fact that hexamethonium suppresses cardiac disturbances in anesthetized rabbits given small intracerebroventricular doses of bupivacaine. The aims of the current study were to determine, in anesthetized dogs, (1) whether the activation of the autonomic nervous system is deleterious after a large intravenous dose of bupivacaine and (2) whether the parasympathetic or sympathetic system is implicated in the bupivacaine-induced deleterious activation of the autonomic nervous system.
We used an electrophysiologic model in closed-chest dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. In group 1 (n = 6), dogs were given 4 mg/kg intravenous bupivacaine over 10 s. In group 2 (n = 6), dogs were given the same dose of bupivacaine 5 min after having received 0.2 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulfate. In group 3 (n = 9), dogs were pretreated with 10 mg/kg intravenous hexamethonium and then given bupivacaine 4 mg/kg. In addition, in group 3, the right atrium was paced at a basic cycle length of 400 ms to obtain a heart rate similar to that of group 1.
Bupivacaine in group 1 induced significant bradycardia; lengthening of PR, atria-His, His-ventricle, and QTc intervals; and QRS widening. The first derivative of left ventricular pressure was significantly decreased, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased. Atropine pretreatment did not modify cardiac disturbances induced by bupivacaine. Hexamethonium pretreatment induced significantly less QRS widening and QTc lengthening than was seen in group 1 but worsened the bupivacaine effects on bradycardia, atria-His and PR intervals, mean aortic pressure, and first derivative of left ventricular pressure. Moreover, atrial pacing in group 3 induced alterations of QRS similar to those in group 1.
Considering that marked slowing of ventricular conduction velocity (i.e., QRS widening) is known to facilitate reentrant ventricular arrhythmias, we conclude that (1) the activation of the autonomic nervous system by bupivacaine is not as deleterious as previously suggested; (2) the parasympathetic system is not markedly implicated in the worsening of direct bupivacaine cardiotoxicity; and (3) the sympathetic nervous system acts only by inducing a less marked bradycardia, which slows ventricular conduction velocity in a use-dependent manner, facilitating reentrant arrhythmias.
Many of the adverse events induced by rifampin have been considered allergic in origin. The flu-like syndrome and other hypersensitivity reactions seem to be caused by immune complexes, although their pathogenetic mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Many cases have been reported of the flu-like syndrome, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and renal failure caused by rifampin. In almost all of the patients in whom they were sought, nonreaginic antirifampin antibodies were detected. On the other hand, anaphylactic reactions seem to be IgE-mediated. We have analyzed the 18 reported cases of anaphylactic reactions severe enough to cause marked hypotension. The interval between the onset of treatment and the anaphylactic reaction was highly variable. Most patients presented with prodromes, mainly rash, before the development of anaphylactic symptoms, and, in most cases, the reaction occurred after reexposure to rifampin. Clinical findings include a variety of symptoms, such as fever, exanthem, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Seven of the 9 patients in whom HIV status was known were seropositive, including the only 2 patients who died. We believe that, in case of a non-life-threatening adverse reaction caused by immune complexes, rifampin could be readministered, if necessary, at a more frequent and reduced dose, perhaps with the addition of corticosteroids. In case of anaphylactic reactions the drug should be avoided, although desensitization procedures may be useful. Certain laboratory findings may serve as a clue to predict anaphylactic reactions in patients who have experienced minor adverse events to rifampin. However, the diagnostic value of such findings is not well established and, therefore, patients with previous adverse reactions should be carefully monitored if reexposure to rifampin is essential.
Pretreatment with 3 different doses of atracurium (0.035 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.07 mg/kg) was investigated in order to determine the optimal dose that would prevent suxamethonium-induced fasciculations with minimal side effects to the patient and without significant antagonism of suxamethonium block. A total of 80 patients was studied. There were 20 patients in each of three atracurium groups while a fourth group of 20 patients served as control. Atracurium reduced the incidence of fasciculations from 100% observed in the control to between 0 and 40% in the atracurium groups. The optimal dose of atracurium appears to be 0.05 mg/kg, using a pretreatment interval of 3 minutes. Routine pretreatment of all patients is not mandatory, but it is recommended whenever the side-effects of suxamethonium are particularly undesirable, as in ocular laceration, raised intracranial pressure, full stomach and in very muscular patients.
