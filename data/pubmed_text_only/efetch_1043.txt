Medical therapy for essential tremor (ET), a common movement disorder, is often inadequate. We performed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of zonisamide (ZNS), an antiepileptic agent, in treating ET. Twenty patients (mean age, 60 +/- 15 years) with ET were randomized to receive ZNS or placebo. ZNS was initiated at a dosage of 100 mg/day and escalated to 200 mg/day at day 14. Patients were evaluated by accelerometry and the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) rating scale at baseline and days 14 and 28, as well as the Clinical Global Impression (CGI-C) scale at day 28. At endpoint, subjects assigned to ZNS were taking a mean dosage of 160 +/- 50 mg/day. There were no significant improvements in the FTM total score or its subsections. Tremor amplitude as assessed by accelerometry significantly improved in the ZNS group compared to the placebo group at endpoint relative to baseline (-0.50 +/- 0.72 vs. 0.30 +/- 0.79 m/s(2); P = 0.03). On the CGI-C, 60% (n = 6) of patients in the ZNS group felt that their tremor was unchanged, while the remaining patients felt that their tremor was "minimally improved." Thirty percent (n = 3) of patients taking ZNS discontinued the study due to side effects (fatigue, headache, paresthesias) while taking 100 mg per day. ZNS did not provide significant improvements in clinical rating scales at study endpoint compared to placebo and was only modestly well tolerated. ZNS was effective in reducing tremor amplitude as measured by accelerometry.
The effects of long-term aurothiomalate and D-penicillamine treatments on renal function and the urinary excretion of prostanoids were studied in 20 patients with classic or definite rheumatoid arthritis. Twelve-hour urine was collected overnight, on the following day blood samples were taken in the morning and 12-hour urine was collected during the following day. Albumin excretion into the urine was determined by a sensitive quantitative method. Beta-2-microglobulin (B2MIGLO) and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) serum concentrations and excretions into the urine were measured to detect possible tubular or glomerular damage, respectively. The excretions of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha into urine were determined. In the aurothiomalate group, albumin excretion ranged 1-16 mg/12 h, and in the penicillamine group 0.8-31 mg/12 h. In the penicillamine group, but not in the aurothiomalate group, total protein, B2MIGLO and PGE2 excretions were higher (p less than 0.05) during the daytime than during the night. The daytime excretion of PGE2 was higher (p less than 0.01) in the penicillamine than in the aurothiomalate group. In the penicillamine group B2MIGLO excretion into urine correlated (p less than 0.01) with PGE2 excretion in the daytime. According to the results, not even long-term aurothiomalate treatment affects renal prostanoid excretion, while penicillamine increases urinary PGE2 excretion. This could be related either to the cofactor-like activity of penicillamine in the prostanoid synthesis or to damage in tubular cells. The role of prostanoids in maintaining blood flow and filtration may be more important in patients with renal damage than in normal conditions.
In a murine model system, folinic acid demonstrated host-protective properties during administration of repetitive and lethal doses of vincristine (VCR). Subsequently, folinic acid was evaluated in patients receiving VCR during an adjuvant chemotherapy program for stage II carcinoma of the breast. The toxicities, cumulative VCR dosage, and percentage of ideal dosage observed in 18 patients receiving folinic acid have been compared with those observed in 70 patients who previously received VCR without folinic acid in the same chemotherapy program. All patients ideally were intended to receive VCR 1.0 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks, with dose modification for neurotoxicity. Treatment patients received folinic acid 800 mg PO daily in three divided doses during the 6-week course. The degree of neurotoxic manifestations of VCR was similar in the treatment and comparison patients. Absent to mild neurotoxicity was observed in approximately 70% of patients in both groups; moderate or greater neurotoxicity occurred in about 30% of patients in both groups. Full dosage (6.0 mg/m2) was attained in 7 (39%) treatment patients and 17 (24%) comparison patients (P = 0.21). The mean percentage of the ideal dosage of VCR was 73.7 +/- 28.7 in patients receiving folinic acid and 76.1 +/- 20.5 in those given only VCR (P = 0.69). Hematologic toxicities were similar in both groups, but nausea occurred more frequently in the folinic acid group. Folinic acid in this dose and schedule afforded no protection from the neurotoxic side effects of VCR.
Among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Los Angeles County, methamphetamine use is associated with high rates of HIV prevalence and sexual risk behaviors. In four separate samples of MSM who differed in the range of their intensity of methamphetamine use, from levels of recreational use to chronic use to those for MSM seeking drug abuse treatment, the association between methamphetamine use and HIV infection increased as the intensity of use increased. The lowest HIV prevalence rate (23%) was observed among MSM contacted through street outreach who mentioned recent methamphetamine use, followed by MSM who used at least once a month for six months (42%), followed by MSM seeking intensive outpatient treatment (61%). The highest rate (86%) was observed among MSM seeking residential treatment for methamphetamine dependence. The interleaving nature of these epidemics calls for comprehensive strategies that address methamphetamine use and concomitant sexual behaviors that increase risk of HIV transmission in this group already at high risk. These and other data suggest that MSM who infrequently use methamphetamine may respond to lower intensity/lower cost prevention and early intervention programs while those who use the drug at dependence levels may benefit from high intensity treatment to achieve goals of reduced drug use and HIV-risk sexual behaviors.
Drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) have been associated with chemotherapy resistance and are considered unfavorable prognostic factors for survival of cancer patients. Analyzing mRNA expression levels of a subset of drug transporters by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or protein expression by tissue microarray (TMA) in tumor samples of therapy naïve stage IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (qRT-PCR, n = 40; TMA, n = 61), this in situ study re-examined the significance of transporter expression for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database was used to externally validate the respective findings (n = 317). In general, HNSCC tended to lower expression of drug transporters compared to normal epithelium. High ABCB1 mRNA tumor expression was associated with both favorable progression-free survival (PFS, p = 0.0357) and overall survival (OS, p = 0.0535). Similar results were obtained for the mRNA of ABCC1 (MRP1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1; PFS, p = 0.0183; OS, p = 0.038). In contrast, protein expression of ATP7b (copper transporter ATP7b), mRNA expression of ABCG2 (BCRP, breast cancer resistance protein), ABCC2 (MRP2), and SLC31A1 (hCTR1, human copper transporter 1) did not correlate with survival. Cluster analysis however revealed that simultaneous high expression of SLC31A1, ABCC2, and ABCG2 indicates poor survival of HNSCC patients. In conclusion, this study militates against the intuitive dogma where high expression of drug efflux transporters indicates poor survival, but demonstrates that expression of single drug transporters might indicate even improved survival. Prospectively, combined analysis of the 'transportome' should rather be performed as it likely unravels meaningful data on the impact of drug transporters on survival of patients with HNSCC.
To investigate the trend and potential pathogenic role of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB P(65)/Rel-A mRNA and angiotensin-II (AngII) receptor type 1 (AT(1)) proteins expression, and the relativity between them in early stage of renal tubulointerstitial lesions in young rats with adriamycin nephrosis and the interfering effects of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) benazepril and ACEI combined with AngII type 1 receptor antagonist (AT(1)RA) Losartan.
Male young Wistar rats with adriamycin nephrosis were used as experimental models. At different time points (weeks 1, 2, and 3 in early nephritic phase, the urinary protein and blood biochemical parameters were measured, and P(65)/Rel-A mRNA was detected; AT(1) protein expression was determined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical methods. The relativity between them was evaluated.
In the early phase of tubulointerstitial lesions, following adriamycin injection and proteinuria aggravated progressively, at week 3, the proteinuria level had reached heavy proteinuria (123.2 +/- 7.7 mg/24 h). The serum parameters reflecting renal function were elevated. The inflammatory cells infiltrated into renal tissues, especially in tubulointerstitial regions, were increased markedly. Swelling of tubular epithelial cells, broadened tubulointerstitial areas, and protein casts in tubule were observed. In situ hybridization and immunochemical staining showed that AT(1) protein was expressed in tubular epithelial cell cytoplasm and on nuclear membranes (AT(1): 1st week 19.8 +/- 1.1%, 2nd week 25.0 +/- 2.6%, 3rd week 37.1 +/- 1.0% (control: 10.3 +/- 0.8%, 10.4 +/- 1.6%, 10.2 +/- 1.5%); and P(65)/Rel-A mRNA expression in the same locations was upregulated. P(65)/Rel-A translocation from cytoplasm into nucleus increased markedly simultaneously. The positive signal of hybridization dominated in cytoplasm gradually became dominant in the nuclei as the pathological changes progressed. The semiquantitative expression of P(65)/Rel-A was 24.0 +/- 3.3% at week 1, 34.2 +/- 2.4% at week 2, 39.9 +/- 6.4% at week 3, while the values of controls were 8.5 +/- 0.4%, 8.7 +/- 1.0%, and 8.4 +/- 0.9%, respectively. There was a positive correlation between AT(1) and P(65)/Rel-A expression in localization and time phase (r = 0.857, P < 0.01). However, the tendency of those factor's expression was all decreased in each treated group, the semiquantitative results were AT(1): 14.6 +/- 2.1%, 13.7 +/- 2.3%, 11.4 +/- 1.1%; P(65)/Rel-A: 18.5 +/- 3.4%, 22.8 +/- 1.6%, 26.7 +/- 4.9% at 1, 2, 3 weeks in ACEI treated group; AT(1): 12.4 +/- 1.5%, 11.1 +/- 1.0%, 10.3 +/- 0.8%; P(65)/Rel-A: 17.9 +/- 5.0%, 21.3 +/- 6.0%, 22.5 +/- 2.5% in AT(1)RA (Losartan) group, respectively. The significant difference were observed between all groups in different time points (P < 0.05).
The present study suggested that NF-kappaB (P(65)/Rel-A) mRNA expression and its activity was enhanced significantly that synchronized with aggravating injures in tubulointerstitial lesions initial period induced by proteinuria-loading in nephrotic young rats. This tendency was related with AngII and its receptors system that may accelerate lesions progressing in many renal diseases.
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a fluoropyrimidine antimetabolite, is widely used in the treatment of cancers of the digestive tract and breast. The clinical cardiotoxicity of 5-FU was first reported in 1975. Adverse cardiac effects include coronary disorders, heart failure and sudden death of suspected cardiac origin. Six new cases are reported, including 5 cases of angina and one of heart failure. The patients, 4 males and 2 females, were 26 to 71 years of age (mean: 56.2). They had no medical history of heart failure, myocardial ischemia or electrocardiographic anomalies prior to 5-FU treatment. Three patients had hypertension of whom one had had type-II diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years. Clinical symptoms included chest pain in 4 patients and heart failure in one, whereas the last patient had ECG changes with no associated clinical symptoms. Clinical symptoms of angina totally disappeared after the cessation of 5-FU administration, but heart failure was alleviated only after the introduction of digitalis, a converting-enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. It has been estimated that 1.6% of patients treated with 5-FU develop adverse cardiac effects. Patients at greater risk are those with a history of ischemic cardiac disease, thoracic radiotherapy or high-dose 5-FU therapy. The mechanism involved is not clearly elucidated. Spasms of the coronary arteries or toxic inflammation of the myocardium have been suspected. These 6 new cases confirm the potential for cardiotoxicity of 5-FU and the need for careful cardiac monitoring of treated patients.
Azelastine, a novel antiallergic medication, was compared with chlorpheniramine maleate and placebo for efficacy and safety in the treatment of spring allergic rhinitis in a multicenter, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-groups study. One hundred fifty-five subjects participated. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2-year history of spring allergic rhinitis, confirmed by positive skin test to spring aeroallergens. Medications were given four times daily; the azelastine groups received 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon; the chlorpheniramine group received 4.0 mg four times daily. Daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4-week treatment period while subjects received study medications. Individual symptoms, total symptoms, and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medication. Elicited, volunteered, and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among groups. Vital signs, body weights, serum chemistry values, complete blood cell counts, urine studies, and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among groups. Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of azelastine (2.0 mg twice daily) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the study. Lower doses of azelastine were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study. In contrast, although the chlorpheniramine group did have fewer symptoms than the placebo group during the study, the difference never reached statistical significance during any week of the study. There were no serious side effects in any of the treatment groups. Drowsiness and altered taste perception were increased significantly over placebo only in the high-dose azelastine group. Azelastine appears to be a safe, efficacious medication for seasonal allergic rhinitis.
Adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence in women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen also increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and endometrial cancer. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) causes profound endometrial suppression. This systematic review considered the evidence that the LNG-IUS prevents the development of endometrial pathology in women taking tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer.
To determine the effectiveness of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system in preventing the development of endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and adenocarcinoma in pre and postmenopausal women taking adjuvant tamoxifen following breast cancer.
All reports which described randomised controlled trials of effects of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system on the endometrium in breast cancer patients taking adjuvant tamoxifen were obtained through searches of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009), MEDLINE (1996 to August 2009), EMBASE (1980 to August 2009), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) (1982 to August 2009).
Randomised controlled trials of women with breast cancer on adjuvant tamoxifen that compared endometrial surveillance or placebo alone versus the LNG-IUS. Women with known endometrial pathology or contraindications to LNG-IUS were excluded.
Only two randomised controlled trials were identified and are included in this review. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. The outcome measures were endometrial pathology (including polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, or adenocarcinoma) diagnosed at hysteroscopy or endometrial biopsy; any reported side effects of treatment; and abnormal vaginal bleeding.
In both included studies, the active treatment arm was the Mirena 20 mug/day levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (Bayer Health Care, US). The LNG-IUS in tamoxifen users led to a significant reduction in the incidence of endometrial polyps (Peto odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.61). Neither trial was sufficiently powered to detect whether LNG-IUS leads to significant changes in the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma in tamoxifen users, nor whether LNG-IUS leads to any increased risk of breast cancer recurrence. There appeared to be more vaginal bleeding in the Mirena treatment group, in the first six months only. However, the bleeding patterns at 12 months were fairly similar for both groups.
The Mirena LNG-IUS appears to prevent the development of benign endometrial polyps in breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen, over a one-year period. There is no clear evidence from the available randomised controlled trials that LNG-IUS prevents endometrial hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma in these patients. Larger studies are necessary to assess the effects of LNG-IUS in preventing endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, and to determine whether LNG-IUS might have an impact on the risk of breast cancer recurrence.
CD69, known as an early activation marker antigen on T and B cells, is also expressed on platelets and activated neutrophils, suggesting certain roles in inflammatory diseases. In order to address the role of CD69 in the pathogenesis of arthritis, we established CD69-null mice. CD69-null mice displayed a markedly attenuated arthritic inflammatory response when injected with anti-type II collagen antibodies. Cell transfer experiments with neutrophils, but not T cells or spleen cells, from wild-type mice into CD69-null mice restored the induction of arthritis. These results indicate a critical role for CD69 in neutrophil function in arthritis induction during the effector phase. Thus, CD69 would be a possible therapeutic target for arthritis in human patients.
Since Caine demonstrated the presence of alpha-adrenergic receptors in prostate tissue in 1975, an alpha-blocker capable of producing maximum relaxation of prostatic tissue with minimum side effects has been sought. Prazosin, a selective alpha-1 blocking agent, must meet these requirements. We report the results of a study undertaken in 28 patients with benign hyperplasia of the prostate demonstrated by flowmetry, clinically and by ultrasound. A significant improvement was observed in all patients except for the ultrasound measured prostate size, which remained unchanged. Undesired effects were observed in 36% of the patients. Despite the initial improvement, 89.3% had abandoned treatment at 1 year principally owing to deterioration of the clinical picture and because they were submitted to surgery (the majority) or treatment with other drugs. We can conclude from our results that prazosin is useful for short-term therapy; i.e., until the patient can be referred for surgery.
We studied an exceptional case of a patient showing serious sinus node dysfunction during lithium treatment with levels constantly within the therapeutic range. After two endocardial explorations we found that the sinus node dysfunction was due to lithium and reversible after its withdrawal.
The known vagolytic effect of quinidine has been termed "atropine-like." This effect was studied in vitro and in vivo. Unlike atropine, quinidine was not found to exert any competitive antagonism to acetylcholine at the muscarine-sensitive cholinoceptors of isolated guinea-pig atria. In the narcosed dog subjected to vagal stimulation, the effects of slow perfusion of quinidine (0.5 mg/kg/min for 120 min) were also different in several ways from those of atropine. The tachycardia induced by quinidine was not concomitant with an inhibition of the cardiomoderation caused by vagal stimulation. Tachycardia appeared at low plasma levels, whereas reduction of vagal influence only occurred at high concentrations. Even then, the effects of vagal stimulation were never totally suppressed. After propranolol, quinidine had no tachycardiac action. This could not be attributed to any difference in metabolism because plasma levels of quinidine were the same in dogs pretreated or not with propranolol. Evidence reported here suggests that the cardioacceleration induced by quinidine is not due to a direct vagolytic action. The slight lowering of vascular resistance and arterial pressure observed cannot fully account for this effect either. An adrenergic mechanism involving beta receptors seems likely. In any case, to describe the effects of quinidine on heart rate as atropine-like is evidently inappropriate and misleading.
Recognition of the harmful effects of sodium fluoride (NaF) on human reproduction is increasing, especially as it relates to female reproduction. However, the mechanism by which NaF interferes with female reproduction is unclear. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of fluoride exposure on female fertility and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: one control group and two NaF-treated groups (100 and 200 mg/L in the drinking water for 12 weeks). Several parameters were evaluated, including: (i) fluoride concentrations; (ii) estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P) concentrations; (iii) estrogen receptor alpha protein (ERα); (iv) progesterone receptor (PgR) protein; (v) follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) protein. The results indicated that administration of NaF lead to significant decreases in E2 and P levels in the serum and in the expression of FSHR protein. In addition, fluoride exposure significantly increased Erα and PgR protein expression levels and LHR protein expression. These results suggest that the reproductive hormone reduction and the abnormalities of related receptor proteins expression are important factors underlying the decreased fertility observed in female rats that have been exposed to NaF.
Furosemide, a blocker of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC), is often used as a diuretic to improve edema, ascites, and pleural effusion of patients with cancers. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether an NKCC blocker affects cancer cell growth. If so, we would clarify the mechanism of this action. We found that poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma cells (MKN45) expressed the mRNA of NKCC1 three times higher than moderately differentiated ones (MKN28) and that the NKCC in MKN45 showed higher activity than that in MKN28. A cell proliferation assay indicates that furosemide significantly inhibited cell growth in MKN45 cells, but not in MKN28 cells. Using flow cytometrical analysis, we found that the exposure to furosemide brought MKN45 cells to spend more time at the G(0)/G(1) phase, but not MKN28 cells. Based on these observations, we indicate that furosemide diminishes cell growth by delaying the G(1)-S phase progression in poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma cells, which show high expression and activity of NKCC, but not in moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma cells with low expression and NKCC activity.
The authors present a case of an elderly patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who developed a significative prolongation of the QT interval after two days of treatment with azithromycin for a community-acquired pneumonia. QT prolongation is associated with a high risk of serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Three days after discontinuation of azithromycin, QT interval returned to the normal value.
Steroidal estrogens can regulate inflammatory immune responses and may be involved in the suppression of multiple sclerosis (MS) during pregnancy. However, the risks and side effects associated with steroidal estrogens may limit their usefulness for long-term MS therapy. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) could provide an alternative therapeutic strategy, because they behave as estrogen agonists in some tissues, but are either inert or behave like estrogen antagonists in other tissues. In this study, we investigated the ability of two commercially available SERMs (tamoxifen and raloxifene) to regulate myelin specific immunity and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Both tamoxifen and raloxifene suppressed myelin antigen specific T-cell proliferation. However, tamoxifen was more effective in this regard. Tamoxifen treatment reduced the induction of major histocompatibility complex II by lipopolysaccharide stimulated dendritic cells and decreased their ability to activate myelin specific T-cells. At lower doses, tamoxifen was found to increase the levels of Th2 transcription factors and induce a Th2 bias in cultures of myelin-specific splenocytes. EAE symptoms and the degree of demyelination were less severe in mice treated with tamoxifen than in control mice. These findings support the notion that tamoxifen or related SERMs are potential agents that could be used in the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune disorders that affect the central nervous system.
Secreted Protein, Acidic, and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC)-null mice were examined for behavioral signs of chronic low back and/or radicular pain.
to assess SPARC-null mice as an animal model of chronic low back and/or radicular pain caused by degenerative disc disease.
degeneration of intervertebral discs is a major cause of chronic low back and adicular pain in humans. Inactivation of the SPARC gene in mice results in premature intervertebral disc degeneration. The effect of disc degeneration on behavioral measures of chronic pain has not been evaluated in this model.
cohorts of young and old (3 and 6-12 months, respectively) SPARC-null and wild-type control mice were screened for behavioral indices of low back and/or radiating pain. Sensitivity to mechanical, cold and heat stimuli, locomotor impairment, and movement-evoked hypersensitivity were determined. Animals were challenged with 3 analgesic agents with different mechanisms: morphine, dexamethasone, and gabapentin.
SPARC-null mice showed signs of movement-evoked discomfort as early as 3 months of age. Hypersensitivity to cold stimuli on both the lower back and hindpaws developed with increasing age. SPARC-null mice had normal sensitivity to tactile and heat stimuli, and locomotor skills were not impaired. The hypersensitivity to cold was reversed by morphine, but not by dexamethasone or gabapentin.
SPARC-null mice display behavioral signs consistent with chronic low back and radicular pain that we attribute to intervertebral disc degeneration. We hypothesize that the SPARC-null mouse is useful as a model of chronic back pain due to degenerative disc disease.
A 52-year-old Black woman on phenytoin therapy for post-traumatic epilepsy developed transient hemiparesis contralateral to the injury. The episode appeared to have been precipitated by toxicity due to ingestion of a large amount of phenytoin. A possible mechanism for focal neurological deficit in brain-damaged patients on phenytoin therapy is discussed.
PAX3 plays an important role in mammalian embryonic development. Known mutations in PAX3 are etiologically associated with Waardenburg syndrome and syndromic neural tube defects (NTDs). Mutations in the murine homologue, pax3, are responsible for the phenotype of splotch mice, in which nullizygotes are 100% penetrant for NTDs.
The study sample included 74 infants with spina bifida (cases) and 87 nonmalformed infant controls. The conserved paired-box domain as well as the upstream genomic region of PAX3 were subjected to resequencing and those identified SNPs were evaluated as haplotypes. The associations of haplotypes for selected gene regions and the risks of spina bifida were further studied.
Nineteen SNPs were observed; 15 observed in controls had been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database with allele frequencies. The PAX3 gene variant T-1186C (rs16863657) and its related haplotype, TCTCCGCCC of nine SNPs, were found to be associated with an increased risk of spina bifida, with an OR of 3.5 (95% CI: 1.2-10.0) among Hispanic Whites.
Our analyses indicated that PAX3 SNPs were not strong risk factors for human spina bifida. However, additional follow-up of the PAX3 gene variant T-1186C (rs16863657) and its related haplotype, TCTCCGCCC, may be important in other populations.
Nine cocaine abusers with cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficits (hypo-perfused areas) on HMPAO SPECT scans were compared to six without these deficits after six doses of isradipine (5 mg TID). When comparing the scan before isradipine to that after using SPM analysis, the ratio of hypo- to hyper-fusion showed a 16% increase in the maximum Z scores and 30% fewer areas of hypo-perfusion among those cocaine abusers with deficits. These deficits may represent segmental cerebral vasospasm that was reversed by this vasodilating agent in cocaine abusers with areas of hypo-perfusion (deficits) as baseline.
We investigated the effect of intratracheal injections of an extract of suspended particulate matter (SPM) obtained from the urban ambient air of Tokyo, upon the development of proliferative lesions of pulmonary endocrine cells (PECs) in the rat. We also examined the modification effects of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, or both of them on the PEC lesions. Male F344 rats were divided into six experimental groups of 5 animals each. Twenty animals were treated with intratracheal instillations of SPM admixed with carbon once a week for 4 weeks with or without additional gaseous exposure (6 ppm nitrogen dioxide or 4 ppm sulfur dioxide) 16 hrs a day for 11 months. Five animals were given intratracheal injections of carbon suspended in saline and the other five were untreated. The subcardiac lobes of the right lung were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. PEC hyperplasias and papillomas were counted in 200 serial sections, 4 microns thick. The average incidences of PEC hyperplasia in the untreated animals and in those treated with carbon were 194 and 200/cm3, respectively. The average incidences of PEC hyperplasia in the animals exposed to SPM tar only, SPM tar plus nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, SPM tar with nitrogen dioxide and SPM tar with sulfur dioxide were 376, 378, 372 and 349/cm3, respectively. These were significantly higher than the levels of the control animals, and additional gaseous stimuli had no effect on the incidence of PEC hyperplasia. Besides PEC hyperplasia, a few PEC papillomas were found in the animals treated with SPM tar, regardless of gaseous exposure, but in the control animals no papilloma was evident. Thus, compounds in airborne particulates are considered to be responsible for the development of PEC hyperplasias and papillomas.
Levodopa (LD)-induced dyskinesia (LID), one of the most common motor complications in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), involve mostly the limbs, trunk and head, but unusual locations have been reported including respiratory muscles, the face and the eyes. The aim of this study was to further investigate the frequency and characteristics of LD-related abnormal involuntary eye movements (AIEMs) in PD. Thirty-two patients with advanced PD and various motor complications were evaluated and videotaped in an ON and OFF state. We found AIEMs in five patients (16%) which were present exclusively during the ON state and which completely disappeared when OFF. They consisted of repeated, stereotyped upward and/or sideways gaze deviation movements, sometimes phasic, brief and jerky, sometimes tonic and sustained for several seconds. The main direction of gaze deviation was toward the side more affected by parkinsonism. AIEMs typically paralleled limb and trunk LID and were modulated by the same facilitation and inhibitory maneuvers. We concluded that AIEMs are not uncommon in advanced PD and represent a particular topography of LID, hence the term 'ocular dyskinesia' to designate these AIEMs that seem to have a specific pattern in PD as compared with other forms of parkinsonism.
Minocycline (MIN) HCl is a tetracycline derivative previously shown to inhibit agonist-induced accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in vitro and suppress motor activity and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats following SC injection. The present study examined the effect of IV and intracerebral MIN on baseline activity and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. IV MIN suppressed both types of activity in doses of 100 and 150 mg/kg. When injected ICV, MIN (50 micrograms/2 microliter) suppressed the increase in rearing elicited by amphetamine but did not affect baseline activity. MIN did not attenuate the behavioral suppression induced by the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram. MIN apparently has centrally mediated effects on motor activity in rats; however, it is not yet possible to associate MIN's behavioral effects with its ability to inhibit agonist-induced stimulation of cAMP.
