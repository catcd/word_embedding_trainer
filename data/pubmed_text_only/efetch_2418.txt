Medical treatment of insomnia has declined over the past decade and, when treated, use of non-hypnotic medications has increased. This study assessed the characteristics of the prescriptions for insomnia and of the patients receiving those prescriptions.
The outpatient pharmacy database of the Henry Ford Hospital, Health Alliance Plan (HAP) was searched from 1/1/98 to 6/30/99 for mentions of the 10 most frequently used drugs for the treatment of insomnia listed in the National Disease and Therapeutic Index for 1987-1996. The 10 drugs were alprazolam, amitriptyline, clonazepam, doxepin, flurazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, trazodone, triazolam, and zolpidem. These were classified by their indication as antidepressant, anxiolytic, or hypnotic and the three indication groupings were compared on patient and prescription characteristics.
Over the 18 month period the total patient population covered by HAP was 287,456; 20,014 (7%) patients received one or more prescriptions for insomnia. Of these, anxiolytics were most frequently prescribed (55%), then antidepressants (25%), and hypnotics least frequently (20%). Patients receiving hypnotics were more likely to be male, older, and to receive a narrower dose range, in smaller quantities and with fewer refills than patients receiving anxiolytics or antidepressants.
In this large managed-care population, hypnotics are prescribed conservatively, while the non-hypnotics, for which there is limited efficacy and safety data, are prescribed on a more chronic basis.
Medulloblastoma accounts for 20 % of all primary pediatric intracranial tumors. Current treatment cures 50-80 % of patients but is associated with significant long-term morbidity and thus new therapeutic targets are needed. One such target is cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a vital role in cell cycle progression and differentiation. CDK6 is overexpressed in medulloblastoma patients and is associated with an adverse prognosis. To investigate the role of CDK6 in medulloblastoma, we assayed the effect of CDK6 inhibition on proliferation by depleting expression with RNA interference (RNAi) or by inhibiting kinase function with a small molecule inhibitor, PD0332991. Cell proliferation was assessed by colony focus assay or by the xCELLigence system. We then investigated the impact of CDK6 inhibition on differentiation of murine neural stem cells by immunofluorescence of relevant markers. Finally we evaluated the effects of PD0332991 treatment on medulloblastoma cell cycle and radiosensitivity using colony focus assays. Gene expression analysis revealed that CDK6 mRNA expression is higher than normal cerebellum in fifteen out of sixteen medulloblastoma patient samples. Inhibition of CDK6 by RNAi significantly decreased medulloblastoma cell proliferation and colony forming potential. Interestingly, CDK6 inhibition by RNAi increased differentiation in murine neural stem cells. PD0332991 treatment significantly decreased medulloblastoma cell proliferation and led to a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, PD0332991 pretreatment sensitized medulloblastoma cells to ionizing radiation. Our findings suggest that targeting CDK6 with small molecule inhibitors may prove beneficial in the treatment of medulloblastoma, especially when combined with radiation.
A hypercholesterolemic patient medicated with cerivastatin for 22 days resulted in acute rhabdomyolysis. CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are the major enzymes responsible for the metabolism of cerivastatin, and a transporter, OATP2, contributes to uptake of cerivastatin to the liver. In this study, the patient's DNA was sequenced in order to identify a variant that would lead to the adverse effect of cerivastatin. Three nucleotide variants, 475delA, G874C, and T1551C, were found in the exons of CYP2C8. The patient was homozygous for 475delA variant that leads to frameshift and premature termination. Accordingly, the patient is most likely lacking the enzyme activity. The patient's children were both heterozygous for the mutation. The patient had three nucleotide variants in exon 4 (A388G) and exon 5 (C571T and C597T) of OATP2 that were all heterozygous. No nucleotide variation in the exons of CYP3A4 was identified. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that the adverse effect of cerivastatin might be caused by the genetic variant of CYP2C8.
Liver fibrosis represents a process of healing and scarring in response to chronic liver injury. Following injury, an acute inflammation response takes place resulting in moderate cell necrosis and extracellular matrix damage. Melittin, the major bioactive component in the venom of honey bee Apis mellifera, is a 26-residue amphipathic peptide with well-known cytolytic, antimicrobial and proinflammatory properties. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of melittin have not been elucidated in liver fibrosis. We investigated whether melittin ameliorates liver inflammation and fibrosis in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis. Two groups of mice were treated with TAA (200 mg/L, in drinking water), one of the groups of mice was co-treated with melittin (0.1 mg/kg) for 12 weeks while the other was not. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were cultured with tumor necrosis factor α in the absence or presence of melittin. Melittin suppresses the expression of proinflammatory cytokines through the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, melittin reduces the activity of HSCs in vitro, and decreases the expression of fibrotic gene responses in TAA-induced liver fibrosis. Taken together, melittin prevents TAA-induced liver fibrosis by inhibiting liver inflammation and fibrosis, the mechanism of which is the interruption of the NF-κB signaling pathway. These results suggest that melittin could be an effective agent for preventing liver fibrosis.
This report describes a 59-year-old woman, who, after an initial reaction to hydralazine, inadvertently took the drug again. She promptly developed symptoms of acute cholangitis--fever, right upper quadrant tenderness, obtundation, and hypotension. Cholecystectomy was performed and no obstruction or infection of the biliary tract was present. Perioperative studies support a diagnosis of hydralazine-induced acute cholangitis, a side effect of the drug which has not been previously described.
Treatment of superficial low-grade bladder cancer often incorporates intravesical instillations of the alkylating agent thio-TEPA. Current dosages and administration schedules are empiric inasmuch as cytokinetic data are sparse. The FANFT-induced bladder rat tumor model closely approximates human bladder cancer. This study measuring 3H-thymidine uptake identified peaks of maximal synthetic activity at 3 and 9 days after thio-TEPA exposure in both normal and neoplastic urothelium. Thus, repeat instillation at these intervals may improve cytotoxicity and overall response rate.
A good model of neuronal death that reproduces the characteristic tau (τ) hyperphosphorylation of Alzheimeŕs disease is the use of okadaic acid (OA). The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of α7 and β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes to neuroprotection against OA in the SH-SY5Y cell line by using the selective α7 and β2* nAChR agonists PNU 282987 and 5-Iodo-A85380, respectively. The results of this study show that both α7 and β2* nAChR can afford neuroprotection against OA-induced neurotoxicity. Protection mediated by α7 nAChRs was independent of Ca(2+) and involved the intracellular signaling pathway Janus Kinase-2/Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt. When Ca(2+) entry was promoted through the α7 nAChR by using the α7-selective positive allosteric modulator PNU 120596, protection was lost. By contrast, protection mediated by β2* nAChRs was Ca(2+) dependent and implicated the signaling pathways PI3K/Akt and extracellular regulated kinase 1/2. Both α7 and β2* nAChR activation converged on downregulation of GSK-3β and reduction of τ phosphorylation in cells undergoing cell death induced by OA. Therefore, targeting nAChR could offer a strategy for reducing neurodegeneration secondary to hyperphosphorylation of protein τ.
Since there appears to be a schedule dose relationship for VP16-213, the current dose seeking study of 5 day continuous infusion was initiated. Patients not candidates for other treatments were started at 75 mg/m2/day X 5. Eight patients had prior chemotherapy, eight had radiotherapy plus chemotherapy and one patient had prior interferon. The median age was 53 (range 23-65) and the median performance status was 60 (range 50-90). Seventeen patients received 20 courses; two at 75 mg/m2/day, seven at 100 mg/m2/day, ten at 125 mg/m2/day, and six at 150 mg/m2/day. The major toxicity was hematologic and median WBC count nadirs (ranges) were respectively: 3.5 (2.3-4.7) X 10(3)/microliters, 1.6 (0.2-3.4) X 10(3)/microliters, 2.4 (0.1-3.6) X 10(3)/microliters, 0.4 ( less than 0.1-0.7) 10(3)/microliters. Platelet count nadirs were respectively: 150, 78 (20-189), 138 (26-326), 16 (9-88) X 10(3)/microliters. The median days to WBC nadir and recovery and did not vary with dose and were 15 (9-21) and 24 (19-38) respectively. Median days to platelet count nadir were 12 (10-29) the recovery 24 (20-38) and did not vary with dose. Non-hematologic toxicities included mild nausea and vomiting, mild mucositis on six courses, diarrhea with two courses and fever during granulocytopenia during seven courses. Three patients manifested evidence of myocardial diseases two with infarction and one with congestive failure during treatment. Two patients showed objective evidence of tumor regression, one patient with seminoma and one patient with renal cell carcinoma. The latter response was short. The current studies demonstrate that high dose continuous infusion VP16-213 is tolerable with acceptable toxicity using doses up to 125 mg/m2/day (625 mg/m2 over 5 days).
In the present study, we investigated the effect of seizures on rat performance in the Morris water maze task, as well as on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in rat hippocampus. Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group) and pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p., pilocarpine group). After the treatments all groups were observed for 1 h. The changes on reference and working spatial memory caused by pilocarpine administration were observed in seized rats. The ChAT and AChE activities were measured using spectrophotometric methods and the results compared to values obtained from saline animals. Its activities were also determined after behavioral task. Results showed that seizures alter reference memory when compared to saline-treated animals. In the working memory task, we observed a significant day's effect with significant differences between control and pilocarpine-induced seizures. In pilocarpine group, it was observed a significant decreased in ChAT and AChE activities, when compared to control group. Our findings suggest that seizures caused cognitive dysfunction and a decrease of ChAT and AChE activities that might be related, at least in part, to the neurological problems presented by seizures induced by pilocarpine.
Antiarrhythmic actions of lorcainide were compared with those of disopyramide on different types of arrhythmias in animal models. It was shown in dogs that lorcainide and disopyramide were approximately equipotent against the arrhythmias following coronary occlusion. In guinea pigs, lorcainide was less effective than disopyramide against the ouabain-induced arrhythmia. Both drugs showed a weak protective action against the aconitine-induced ventricular arrhythmias, but had no effect on the cardiac arrest. In the arrhythmias induced by the application of acetylcholine on the right auricle of guinea pigs, the disappearance of P-waves and the disturbance of R-R intervals were inhibited by disopyramide, but lorcainide had no influence on these events; both prevented the atrial fibrillation induced by acetylcholine application. Both drugs by themselves induced ventricular arrhythmias in guinea pigs.
The use of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, a new class of analgesic drugs, is suggested in patients with hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
To evaluate tolerance to etoricoxib, a new cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in NSAID-sensitive patients with urticaria-type adverse reactions.
Thirty-seven patients with adverse reactions to NSAIDs.
Single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge with increasing doses of etoricoxib.
Thirty-four patients tolerated etoricoxib treatment without adverse reactions, but a generalized urticarial rash developed in 3 patients (8%).
Etoricoxib, like other cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, is a well-tolerated drug in most NSAID-sensitive patients. However, according to our experience, a previous challenge test in a safe environment may be necessary before prescribing the drug to such patients.
A full-term baby boy developed congestive cardiac failure secondary to left-to-right shunts. He developed acute renal failure following the administration of oral enalapril given for the treatment of cardiac failure. There was no underlying renal disease or renal artery stenosis. He required three peritoneal dialyses, following which he recovered from the renal failure.
The present study investigated the involvement of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the inhibitory effect of single administration of cocaine (COC, 15 mg/kg i.p.) on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in slices of rat dentate gyrus (DG), prepared 30 min and 2 days after COC administration. These effects of COC were blocked by an antagonist of 5-HT(1A) receptors, WAY 100635 (0.4 mg/kg i.p.), which had been administered 20 min before COC. The detrimental effect of COC on LTP in slices prepared 30 min after COC administration could be prevented by blocking glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) using mifepristone (RU 38486, 10 mg/kg s.c. given 1 h before COC), similar as in slices obtained 2 days after COC as reported previously [Maćkowiak et al. (2008) Eur J Neurosci 27:2928-2937]. After a single administration of an agonist of 5-HT(1A) receptors, 8-OH-DPAT, (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), the level of LTP in slices prepared 2 days later was significantly decreased resembling the effect of COC. This effect of 8-OH-DPAT was antagonized by WAY 100635 (0.4 mg/kg i.p.), administered 20 min before 8-OH-DPAT and by RU 38486, given 1 h before 8-OH-DPAT. COC-induced inhibition of LTP could be blocked by the inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), SL 327 (50 mg/kg i.p.), administered 1 h before COC, but not by the inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), LY 294002 (80 mg/kg i.p.). COC-induced reduction in the number of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM)-positive neurons in rat dentate gyrus could also be prevented by WAY 100635, given 20 min before COC. These data indicate that the indirect 5-HT(1A) receptor activation by a single COC administration and subsequent stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK 1/2) signaling pathway result in a decrease of the potential for long-term increase in synaptic efficacy in rat DG lasting at least two but less than 7 days, most likely via activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
This purpose of this prospective and descriptive study was to evaluate the utility of a calcium-channel inhibitor, i.e. nifedipine, for management of preterm labor in our work setting in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness in comparison with betamimetics classically used for this indication. Study was carried out over a six-month period in the department of Gynecology-Obstetrics Department of Ignace Deen National Hospital in Conakry, Guinea. Pregnant women meeting the following criteria were included: 28 to 33 weeks of amenorrhea, six days of hospitalization either for preterm labor or for another diagnosis that was associated with the occurrence of preterm labor during hospitalization, and absence of contraindications for tocolysis using nifedipine. A total of 42 women were included. Pregnancy was extended for more than 48 hours after the first dose of nifedipine in 86.8% of cases. Administration of nifedipine failed in 5 cases including one case in which it was necessary to change the tocolytic and 4 cases in which delivery occurred less than 48 hours after the first dose of nifedipine. In 68% of cases, 90 mg of nifedipine were sufficient to stop uterine contractions within 48 hours. In 39.5% of cases, no side effects were observed. Adverse effects in the other cases were dizziness (39.5%) and headache (18.4%). The mean term of delivery was 36 weeks +/- 5 days of amenorrhea with a mean extension of 6.2 weeks. Apgar score was low in 30.5% of the newborns and normal in 69.5%. One newborn (2.8%) died. The results of this study indicate that nifedipine is an effective, economical and safe drug for tocolysis and that it can be used as an alternative to betamimetis in countries with limited resources. An information campaign is needed to promote use of nifedipine as a tocolytic in obstetrical facilities of our country.
Pentamidine isethionate induced torsades de pointes in a 33-year-old woman with acute myelogenous leukemia. This is the first report of Pentamidine-induced torsades de pointes in Japan for over ten years. On the 4th day of intravenous pentamidine for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, asymptomatic sinus bradycardia was noted with QT interval prolongation, and torsades de pointes were revealed on the 8th day. Although torsades de pointes was dissolved with discontinuation of the intravenous pentamidine and administration of magnesium sulfate, sinus bradycardia and prolonged QT interval persisted. Ventricular pacing resulted in no arrhythmia and normalization of the QT interval on the 10th day after discontinuation of pentamidine. Careful monitoring of the electrocardiogram should be carried out during intravenous pentamidine therapy.
The aim of the present study was to observe possible cortical abnormalities after repetitive pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in rats during development.
Wistar rats received intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine hydrochloride 2% (380 mg/kg) at P7, P8, and P9. All experimental rats displayed SE after pilocarpine injections. Rats were killed at P10 and P35, and immunocytochemistry procedures were performed on 50-microm vibratome sections, by using antibodies against nonphosphorylated neurofilament (SMI-311), parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD-65). Selected sections were used for the TUNEL method and double-labeling experiments, with different mixtures of the same markers.
The major findings of the present work were (a) altered intracortical circuitry development; (b) anticipation of PV immunoreactivity in neocortical interneurons; (c) increased GAD-65 immunoreactivity; and (d) reduced neocortical apoptotic process.
From these results, we suggest that previously healthy brain, without genetic abnormalities, might develop an "acquired" disruption of cortical development whose evolution reproduces some characteristics of the childhood epilepsies associated with cognitive impairment.
Coordination of gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi and effect of cholecystectomy on biliary pressure physiology were investigated in 7 patients using an indwelling microtransducer catheter placed in the bile duct by duodenoscopy. Intramuscular morphine (0.2 mg/kg) to induce a sphincter of Oddi spasm produced no change before cholecystectomy but intravenous caerulein (0.1 microgram/kg) induced pressure elevation coincident with gallbladder contraction on echogram. After cholecystectomy, however, morphine caused a pressure rise and a coarse and irregular change of the tracings, which seemed attributable to sphincter of Oddi spasm. Caerulein promptly reduced the pressure and eliminated the irregularity. These results show (a) the sphincter of Oddi relaxes when the gallbladder contracts in response to caerulein and (b) the gallbladder acts as a pressure reservoir against the sphincter of Oddi spasm caused by morphine. The latter implies that the spasm of the sphincter of Oddi readily leads to a pressure rise if the gallbladder is absent, which may partly explain a development of postcholecystectomy syndrome.
An international, multicenter, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to determine the safety and antidepressant efficacy of moclobemide, a new reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, and imipramine in the treatment of dysthymia (DSM-III-R). A total of 315 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to an 8-week treatment in one of three groups (moclobemide, imipramine and placebo). Patients were male or female outpatients aged between 18 and 65 years meeting DSM-III-R criteria for dysthymia, primary type, with late or early onset. Of the patients in each group 85% completed the 8-week treatment period. The percentage of patients who no longer fulfilled DSM-III-R symptom criteria at treatment endpoint was significantly higher in the moclobemide (60%) and imipramine (49%) treatment groups than in the placebo group (22%). Differences to placebo were also statistically significant both for moclobemide and for imipramine on the other efficacy variables (i.e. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, final overall efficacy assessment, Clinical Global Impression and symptom check list self-rating). A significant superiority of moclobemide and imipramine over placebo was found in pure dysthymia and in double-depression, as well as in early and late onset subgroups. In early onset cases, moclobemide was significantly more effective than was imipramine on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Anticholinergic symptoms and sleepiness were significantly more frequent side effects on imipramine than on moclobemide or on placebo, and the investigators' final overall assessment of tolerability significantly favoured moclobemide over imipramine. This study demonstrates the efficacy of high dose moclobemide (mean dose 675 mg/day) and high dose imipramine (220 mg/day) against placebo in the treatment of dysthymia. Moclobemide was better tolerated than was imipramine.
Two groups of 30 patients each suffering from gonococcal urethritis were treated either with minocyclin for 7 days or with a single administration of penicillin or spectinomycin, respectively. 30% of them revealed an additional infection with C. trachomatis or U. urealyticum. On the 8th day, we observed remaining symptoms in only 20% of the patients treated with minocyclin, but in 40% of the group treated with penicillin/spectinomycin.
In 1997, a 27-year-old homosexual man contracted acute hepatitis B that developed into chronic hepatitis. Because of repeated flares, administration of lamivudine was started in March 2002. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA immediately decreased, but the serum level of alanine aminotransferase gradually increased. Drug-induced hepatitis due to lamivudine was excluded. It was suspected that the progression of liver damage was caused by hepatitis delta virus (HDV), because the patient was positive for both anti-HDV antibody and HDV RNA. Co-infection of HDV should be considered a possibility if liver injury is not improved by lamivudine therapy.
To study the preventive effects of Qianggan-Rongxian Decoction on liver fibrosis induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in rats.
Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into hepatic fibrosis model group, control group and 3 treatment groups (12 rats in each group). Except for the normal control group, all the rats received 1% DMN (10 muL/kg body weight, i.p), 3 times a week for 4 wk. The rats in the 3 treatment groups including a high-dose DMN group (10 mL/kg), a medium-dose DMN group (7 mL/kg), and a low-dose DMN group (4 mL/kg) were daily gavaged with Qianggan-Rongxian Decoction, and the rats in the model and normal control groups were given saline vehicle. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the changes in serum hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), and type IV collagen levels. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were measured using routine laboratory methods. Pathologic changes, particularly fibrosis, were examined by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Sirius red staining. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were examined by transmission electron microscopy.
Compared with the model control group, the serum levels of HA, LN, type IV collagen, ALT and AST were decreased markedly in the other groups after treatment with Qianggan-Rongxian Decoction, especially in the medium-dose DMN group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the area-density percentage of collagen fibrosis was lower in the Qianggan-Rongxian Decoction treatment groups than in the model group, and a more significant drop was observed in the medium-dose DMN group (P < 0.05).
Qianggan-Rongxian Decoction can inhibit hepatic fibrosis due to chronic liver injury, delay the development of cirrhosis, and notably ameliorate liver function. It may be used as a safe and effective thera-peutic drug for patients with fibrosis.
Lack of vasodilator substances, such as nitric oxide (NO), has been implicated in the development of pulmonary hypertension, but the pathogenesis of the disease remains speculative. We hypothesized that NO plays a role in the pathogenesis of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), and may serve as a sensitive and specific marker of disease progression and/or severity. To test this, exhaled NO and pulmonary artery pressure were measured in individuals with PPH and secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) on various therapies, including the potent vasodilator epoprostenol (prostacyclin), compared with healthy controls. NO in exhaled breath of individuals with PPH was lower than SPH or control (p<0.05). In contrast, exhaled NO of individuals with PPH or SPH receiving epoprostenol was strikingly higher than PPH or SPH individuals not receiving epoprostenol, or controls. Concomitant with higher NO levels, right ventricular systolic pressure of individuals significantly decreased with epoprostenol. Importantly, in paired measures of exhaled NO before and after epoprostenol, NO increased in all pulmonary hypertensive individuals 24 h after initiation of epoprostenol therapy (p<0.05). NO may be a useful noninvasive marker of pulmonary hypertension severity and response to prostacyclin therapy.
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is a common problem in women and may have a negative impact on quality of life. A recent clinical study shows an increase in sexual drive of HSDD women after cotreatment of testosterone and vardenafil (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor).
In this study, we investigated the effect of testosterone and vardenafil on sexual activity in female rats.
  Proceptive (darts and hops), receptive (lordosis), and paced-mating (percentages after exits and contact-return latencies) behaviors were quantified.
Ovariectomized female rats, sub-primed with only estradiol and fully primed with estradiol and progesterone, were tested in a paced-mating sex test and sexual behaviors were quantified. The sub-primed rats are thought to model HSDD. The effect of testosterone (100 and 300 µg, subcutaneous [SC]) and vardenafil (10 mg/kg, per os [PO]) alone and testosterone (300 µg, SC) in combination with vardenafil (3 and 10 mg/kg, PO) were tested. We also studied the effects of testosterone (300 µg, SC) + intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of vardenafil (25 and 50 µg) on sexual activity.
No effect of testosterone and vardenafil alone was found, but cotreatment of testosterone and vardenafil (PO) caused a significant increase in proceptive and receptive behavior in the sub-primed female rats. Testosterone and vardenafil did not affect fully primed females. ICV administration of vardenafil combined with systemic testosterone, on the other hand, had no effect on sexual activity in both sub-primed and fully primed female rats.
We conclude that cotreatment of subcutaneous testosterone and oral vardenafil increase sexual activity in sub-primed female rats. Our data supports the human finding that combination treatment of testosterone and vardenafil could be used as a new treatment for women with HSDD.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a serious side effect of various drugs. Elevated renal prostaglandin E2 levels have been found in patients with lithium-induced NDI and have been implicated in the pathogenesis. We report the case of a patient who developed NDI following treatment with amphotericin B. Prostaglandin levels were elevated. Indomethacin had an antidiuretic effect and normalized prostaglandin levels.
