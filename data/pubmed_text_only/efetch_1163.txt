Among 16 newly synthesized hexafluorotrihydroxyvitamin D3 derivatives, 24-Homo-26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro (24H-F6)-1,24(S), 25(OH)3 vitamin D3 (VD3) (DD-011) [16] induced differentiation (i.e., appearance of NBT-positive cells) of human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells most efficiently (EC50=0.5 nM), followed by 24H-F6-1,25(OH)2-22-oxa-VD3 (DD-006) [11] > F6-1,25(OH)2-VD3 (F6VD3) [2] > F6-1,25(OH)2-22-ene-VD3 (DD-009) [14] > 24H-F6-1,25(OH)2-VD3 (F6C28) [3] > 24H-F6-1,25(OH)2-1,23(S),25(OH)3-VD3 (DD-015) [18] > 24H-F6-1,25(OH)2-22-ene-VD3 (mvd1400) [6] > 22H-F6-1,25(OH)2-24-ene-VD3 (mvd3400) [5] > 24H-F6-1,23(R),25(OH)3-VD3 (DD-014) [17] > 24H-F6-1,22(S),25(OH)3-VD3 (DD-003) [7] > 24H-F6-1,22(S),25(OH)3-24-yne-VD3 (DD-005) [9] > 24H-F6-1,22(R),25(OH)3-24-yne-VD3 (mvd-1235) [10] > F6-1,25(OH)2-22-ene-VD3 (DD-008) [13] = 1,25(OH)2VD3 [1] (CC50=6 nM). On the other hand, 24H-F6-1,22(R),25(OH)3-VD3 (DD-004) [8], which is an isomer of DD-003 [7], showed much reduced activity (CC50=100 nM), suggesting the importance of the configuration of the OH group at the C-22. When their differentiation-inducing activity was plotted vs. the octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) used as a parameter of hydrophobicity, a bell-shaped curve was produced, with the bottom at log P=5.4-5.8. There was no clear-cut relationship between the differentiation-inducing activity and hypercalcemic activity (serum calcium elevating activity). Compounds [3, 7, 11, 17] showed relatively higher differentiation-inducing activity, with lesser hypercalcemic activity, as compared with [1]. Administration of [7] showed potent antiproliferation activity against colon cancer transplanted in nude mice. These results further confirmed the antitumor potential of hexafluorotrihydroxyvitamin D3 derivatives.
Although epidural lidocaine administered as a bolus has been shown to cause little neurotoxicity, local anesthetics are often administered repetitively or continuously into the epidural space, and in high doses may induce neurologic injury. We investigated whether epidural lidocaine is neurotoxic when a large dose is continuously administered in rats, and whether the functional impairment and histologic damage is dose dependent. In Experiment 1, 13 rats received a 120-min epidural infusion (at 5 microL/min) of saline or 2% lidocaine. Four days after infusion, rats given 2% lidocaine developed significantly more prolonged tail-flick latencies and showed more apparent morphologic damage than those given saline. In Experiment 2, 41 rats were randomly divided into 5 groups to receive an epidural infusion of saline for 120 min or 5% lidocaine for 15, 30, 60, or 120 min at a rate of 5 muL/min. Rats given 5% lidocaine for 120 min developed a significant increase in tail-flick latency. Paw pressure thresholds did not change in any group. Nerve injury scores for rats given 5% lidocaine for 30, 60, and 120 min were significantly higher than those for rats given saline. Significant difference in damage in nerve roots was also observed among rats given the anesthetic for different durations of time; nerve injury scores with 120-min infusion were higher than with 15- and 30-min infusions, and injury with 60-min infusion was greater than with 15-min infusion. In conclusion, these results suggest that epidural lidocaine causes dose-dependent neurotoxicity after continuous infusion in rats.
Niacin is underutilised because of flushing. Lack of a quantitative tool to assess niacin-induced flushing has precluded the objective evaluation of flushing associated with extended-release (ER) niacin formulations. We developed the Flushing Symptom Questionnaire((c)) (FSQ), a quantitative tool to assess patient-reported flushing, and assessed its ability to characterise ER niacin-induced flushing.
This study focused on the responses to one question in the FSQ, the Global Flushing Severity Score (GFSS), reported on a 0-10 scale (none = 0, mild = 1-3, moderate = 4-6, severe = 7-9 and extreme = 10) to assess flushing during ER niacin initiation (week 1) and maintenance (weeks 2-8).
Flushing severity with ER niacin was greatest during week 1 and remained greater than placebo for the study duration. During weeks 2-8, 40% of patients on ER niacin vs. 8% of those on placebo had > 1 day/week with 'moderate or greater' GFSS.
In conclusion, the GFSS component of the FSQ was a sensitive and responsive quantitative measure of ER niacin-induced flushing that will aid in the objective comparison of novel strategies intended to improve tolerability and adherence to niacin, an agent proven to reduce cardiovascular risk.
A case of metoclopramide-induced pseudotetanus in a 24-year-old woman is described. Symptoms included flexor spasms of the neck muscles, neck pain, left deviation of the lower jaw and tongue protrusion. Tetanus was initially suspected. Mydriasis, hyperhydrosis and clinical observation indicated that this syndrome could be caused by metoclopramide taken for gastrointestinal symptoms. Orphenadrine hydrochloride, diazepam and ketoprofen completely resolved the symptoms. Pseudotetanus presents in many different ways, and it is sometimes very hard to distinguish it from infective tetanus, which is very difficult to diagnose. Physicians using metoclopramide should be aware of its adverse effects and how to treat them.
1. The behavioural and convulsant effects of imipenem, a carbapenem derivative, were studied after i.p. administration in DBA/2 mice, a strain genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures and in Swiss mice. 2. It was found that DBA/2 mice were more susceptible to seizures induced by imipenem than Swiss mice. 3. The proconvulsant effects of some quinolones were also evaluated in DBA/2 mice on seizures evoked by means of i.p. administration of imipenem. The present study demonstrated that the order of proconvulsant activity in our epileptic model was pefloxacin > enoxacin > ofloxacin > nalidixic acid > rufloxacin > norfloxacin > ciprofloxacin > cinoxacin > temafloxacin. 4. The relationship between the chemical structure and the proconvulsant activity of quinolone derivatives was studied. The relationship between the lipophilicity and the proconvulsant activity was also investigated. 5. Although the main mechanism for seizure potentiation cannot be easily determined potential drug interactions exist. It has been reported that imipenem and quinolones are all believed to increase excitation of the central nervous system by inhibition of GABA binding to receptors. 6. A slow clearance from the central nervous system and from the kidney may also occur following the concomitant administration of some quinolones and imipenem.
Twenty-three patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma were randomized as part of two multicenter Phase III trials to receive either 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/interferon alpha-2A (INF-alpha) or 5-FU +/- leucovorin. The patients were evaluated regularly for response by CT of the abdomen when treatment began and then every six to eight weeks. incidentally, we found that four of 13 patients treated with 5-FU/INF-alpha and none of ten patients treated with 5-FU +/- leucovorin developed hepatic steatosis during treatment. The diagnoses were based on a decreased CT value of the liver parenchyma by the repeated CT, and histologically verified by liver biopsies. There was no relationship to cumulative 5-FU or INF-alpha dose. Based on posttreatment CT, the liver parenchyma changes were reversible after therapy was stopped. Recognition of this condition in patients receiving 5FU/INF-alpha is important to prevent a patient from being labeled as having progressive hepatic metastases.
Multiple bilateral microinjections of 5 microg picrotoxin (antagonist of chloride channels coupled with GABAA receptors) into the globus pallidus induced lethal seizures in some rats and impaired conditioned avoidance responses in survivors. Administration of 15 microg amphetamine into the rostral neostriatum prevented picrotoxin-induced lethal seizures and reduced its negative effects on active avoidance behavior. Activation of the neostriatal dopaminergic system in animals receiving no intrapallidal picrotoxin promoted recovery of conditioned responses after implantation procedure.
Chromium and nickel compounds cause irritancy but can also induce allergic contact dermatitis. The aims of this study were to characterize the direct cytotoxic effects of Cr(VI), Cr(III) and Ni(II) salts on keratinocytes, and to investigate pharmacological strategies to protect cells against Cr(VI)-induced cytotoxicity. Normal human keratinocytes and the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line were used. Cell viability was assessed by neutral red dye uptake, the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) eluted stain assay and measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the medium. The assays varied slightly in their sensitivities (neutral red > MTT > LDH) although all three gave similar results. In both cell types, the relative order of cytotoxicity of the salts was Cr(VI) > Ni(II) > Cr(III). There were no major differences between chromium salts of a common valency. Normal human keratinocytes showed a much greater variability in their response to Cr(VI) and Ni(II) salts than HaCaT cells and were generally more resistant to Cr(VI)- and Ni(II)-induced cytotoxicity. Several drugs were screened for their potential to protect both cell types against the cytotoxic effects of Cr(VI), specifically the reducing agents ascorbic acid, cysteine and glutathione, and the Cr(VI) cellular uptake inhibitors 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulphonic acid (DIDS) and 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulphonic acid (SITS). All five drugs provided concentration-dependent protection against Cr(VI)-induced cytotoxicity but only ascorbic acid offered complete protection. Several of these pharmacological approaches to the prevention of Cr(VI) cytotoxicity confirm previous clinical studies on the inactivation of Cr(VI), while the clinical potential of others has yet to be investigated.
The efficacies of pefloxacin, fosfomycin, and both of these agents in combination against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were assessed in a rat endocarditis model. The combination prevented emergence of the fosfomycin and pefloxacin resistance seen in 36 and 4%, respectively, of animals receiving either agent alone and was more effective than either agent in sterilizing cardiac vegetations.
Bone metastases occur in more than one-third of patients with advanced lung cancer and are difficult to treat. We showed previously the therapeutic effect of a third-generation bisphosphonate, minodronate, and anti-parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) neutralizing antibody on bone metastases induced by the human small cell lung cancer cell line, SBC-5, in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice. The purpose of our current study was to examine the effect of the combination of PTHrP antibody and zoledronic acid, which has been approved to treat bone metastases, against bone metastases produced by SBC-5 cells expressing PTHrP. Treatment with PTHrP antibody and/or zoledronic acid did not affect the proliferation of SBC-5 cells in vitro. Repeated treatments with either PTHrP antibody or zoledronic acid inhibited the formation of osteolytic bone metastases of SBC-5 cells but had no effect on metastases to visceral organs. Importantly, combined treatment with PTHrP antibody and zoledronic acid further inhibited the formation of bone metastases. Histologic assays showed that, compared with either PTHrP antibody or zoledronic acid alone, their combination decreased the number of tumor-associated osteoclasts and increased the number of apoptotic tumor cells. These findings suggest that this novel dual-targeting therapy may be useful for controlling bone metastases in a subpopulation of small cell lung cancer patients.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. Current therapeutic options include surgery and targeted molecular approaches such as imatinib and sunitinib. Our aim was to establish patient-derived GIST xenografts for the use of screening new drugs and improving current treatment regimens used in GIST. In this present study, we investigate the antitumor activity of sorafenib against patient-derived GIST xenografts. Murine xenograft models were given two oral doses of sorafenib daily for 30 days and growth of established tumor xenografts was monitored at least twice weekly by vernier caliper measurements. Western blotting was then used to determine changes in proteins in these xenografts before and after sorafenib therapy. Apoptotic and cell proliferation were analyzed by immunohistochemisty. Our data found that oral administration of sorafenib to mice, bearing patient-derived GIST xenografts, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth. Sorafenib-induced growth inhibition was associated with decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and reduction in tumor angiogenesis. Western blot analysis revealed that sorafenib inhibited C-Raf, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and phospho-MEK1 (Thr286) slightly as well as phospho-c-Kit (Tyr568/Tyr570), phospho- platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (Tyr1021), and phospho-Flk1 (Tyr951), suggesting that sorafenib inhibited GIST growth by blocking the Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway and angiogenesis. Sorafenib also induced cell cycle arrest, evident through increased levels of p15 and p27 and decreased levels of p21, cyclin A, cyclin B1, and cdc-2. Our study provides a strong rationale for the clinical investigation of sorafenib in patients with GIST as well as an established platform for further drug evaluation studies using GIST xenograft models.
In patients with asthma, increased sensitivity of airway sensory nerves may be involved in producing bronchospasm and cough. To evaluate the effect of a leukotriene-modifying agent on cough reflex sensitivity, we measured the cough response to inhaled capsaicin before and after a 1 4-day course of therapy with zafirlukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, in a group of stable asthmatics. The concentration of capsaicin inducing two or more (C2) and five or more (C5) coughs was not altered by zafirlukast, even in those subjects demonstrating a significant change (increment or decrement) in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1). These findings support previous evidence that cough and bronchoconstriction are modulated by distinct neural pathways.
Lamivudine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients. Recent studies show that the YMDD motif mutants (resistant hepatitis B virus) occur as natural genome variability in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients. In this study we aimed to determine the rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients in Iran.
A total of 77 chronic hepatitis B patients who had not been treated with lamivudine were included in the study. Serum samples from patients were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for detection of YMDD motif mutants. All patients were also tested for liver enzymes, anti-HCV, HBeAg, and anti-HBe.
Of the 77 patients enrolled in the study, 73% were male and 27% were female. Mean ALT and AST levels were 124.4+/-73.4 and 103.1+/-81 IU/l, respectively. HBeAg was positive in 40% and anti-HBe in 60% of the patients. Anti-HCV was negative in all of them. YMDD motif mutants were not detected in any of the patients despite the liver enzyme levels and the presence of HBeAg or anti-HBe.
Although the natural occurrence of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated patients with chronic hepatitis B has been reported, these mutants were not detected in Iranian lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients.
An alarming number of people use cocaine, a drug surrounded with myths and misconceptions. Cocaine use is associated with many medical and psychiatric problems. It is now believed cocaine use may lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cocaine stimulates the release of various neurotransmitters in the brain as well as blocks their uptake, causing a temporary surge in systolic blood pressure. The constant assault on the vessels from continuous cocaine use weakens them causing hemorrhage or possibly creates an aneurysm. This article explains how cocaine affects the blood vessels and neurotransmitters of the brain, reviews two case histories in which cocaine may have contributed to aneurysmal formation and subarachnoid hemorrhage and discusses nursing implications of cocaine related subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of rosiglitazone on endothelial function and inflammatory markers in patients with the metabolic syndrome.
This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. One hundred subjects (54 men and 46 women) with the metabolic syndrome, as defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III, were followed for 12 months after random assignment to rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) or placebo. Primary end points were flow-mediated dilation and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels; secondary end points were lipid and glucose parameters, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of insulin sensitivity, endothelial function score, and circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, and adiponectin.
Compared with 60 control subjects matched for age and sex, patients with the metabolic syndrome had decreased endothelial function, raised concentrations of inflammatory markers, and reduced insulin sensitivity. After 12 months, subjects with the metabolic syndrome receiving rosiglitazone showed improved flow-mediated vasodilation (4.2%, P < 0.001) and reduced hs-CRP levels (-0.7 mg/dl, P = 0.04), compared with the placebo group. Moreover, HOMA (-0.8, P = 0.01) and serum concentrations of IL-6 (-0.5 pg/ml, P = 0.045) and IL-18 (-31 pg/ml, P = 0.036) were significantly reduced in subjects receiving rosiglitazone, whereas adiponectin levels showed a significant increment (2.3 microg/ml, P = 0.02). High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels increased more and triglyceride levels decreased more in the rosiglitazone group compared with the placebo group. At 1 year of follow-up, 30 subjects receiving rosiglitazone still had features of the metabolic syndrome, compared with 45 subjects receiving placebo (P < 0.001).
Rosiglitazone might be effective in reducing the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome.
Left atrial (LA) clots involving prosthetic mitral valves are unusual complications of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and little is known about their natural history. A 73-year-old woman underwent bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement, which was complicated by atrial fibrillation and LA thrombus due to HIT. She was treated medically and followed up for 18 months. The present case provides unique insights into the natural history of HIT-related LA thrombus involving a bioprosthetic valve. It highlights the importance of having a high index of suspicion for this condition and avoiding the use of warfarin early in the course of the condition.
Copper is required for cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Cellular copper metabolism is regulated by a network of copper transporters and chaperones. Antioxidant-1 (ATOX1) is a cytosolic copper chaperone important for intracellular copper transport, which plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation by functioning as a transcription factor in cell growth signal-transduction pathways. The present study aimed to explore the role of ATOX1 in the copper-related regulation of lung cancer cell proliferation by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of ATOX1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue samples and by assessing the effects of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of ATOX1 on copper-stimulated proliferation of NSCLC cells. Overexpression of ATOX1 was detected in NSCLC by IHC analysis of the tissue samples from patients diagnosed with NSCLC when compared with expression of ATOX1 in non-malignant lung tissue samples. Knockdown of ATOX1 in the NSCLC cells transduced by a lentiviral vector encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specific for ATOX1 was associated with reduction in copper-stimulated cell proliferation. These findings suggest that ATOX1 plays an important role in copper-stimulated proliferation of NSCLC cells and ATOX1 holds potential as a therapeutic target for lung cancer therapy targeting copper metabolism.
Atherosclerosis and its complications such as stroke, myocardial infraction and peripheral vascular disease, remain the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Studies have showed that chemokines and adhesion molecules are involved in causing atherosclerosis by promoting directed migration of inflammatory cells. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is one of the key factors critical for the initiating and developing of atherosclerotic lesions. IL-8, a CXC chemokine, stimulates neutrophil chemotaxis. Aspirin is the most common drug used to prevent the complications of atherosclerosis such as stroke and coronary heart disease. In this study, we found that aspirin inhibited TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml)-induced MCP-1 and IL-8 expression at the RNA and protein levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), monocyte adhesion and transmigration, and that its inhibitory effects were not due to decreased HUVEC viability as assessed by MTT test. Aspirin at the dose as low as 10 microg/ml significantly inhibited the release of TNF-stimulated MCP-1 by 29.1% (P = 0.008) and IL-8 by 26.9% (P = 0.0146) as compared to TNF-stimulated release. Antibodies pretreatment were likely to decrease the production of MCP-1 (P < 0.0001) and IL-8 (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, aspirin (10 microg/ml) inhibited U937 cell adhesion by a 13.4% (P = 0.0119) inhibition as compared to TNF-stimulated alone. Finally, at higher concentration, aspirin also inhibited U937 migration to HUVEC by 89.1% (P = 0.0475) as compared to TNF-stimulated alone. These results in our study suggest that aspirin inhibits TNF-alpha stimulated MCP-1 and IL-8 release in HUVECs, for its additional therapeutic effects of aspirin in causing atherosclerosis.
Ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) is a cell cycle checkpoint protein activated in response to DNA damage. We recently reported that ATM plays a protective role in myocardial remodeling following β-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Here we investigated the role of ATM in cardiac remodeling using myocardial infarction (MI) as a model.
Left ventricular (LV) structure, function, apoptosis, fibrosis, and protein levels of apoptosis- and fibrosis-related proteins were examined in wild-type (WT) and ATM heterozygous knockout (hKO) mice 7 days post-MI. Infarct sizes were similar in both MI groups. However, infarct thickness was higher in hKO-MI group. Two dimensional M-mode echocardiography revealed decreased percent fractional shortening (%FS) and ejection fraction (EF) in both MI groups when compared to their respective sham groups. However, the decrease in %FS and EF was significantly greater in WT-MI vs hKO-MI. LV end systolic and diastolic diameters were greater in WT-MI vs hKO-MI. Fibrosis, apoptosis, and α-smooth muscle actin staining was significantly higher in hKO-MI vs WT-MI. MMP-2 protein levels and activity were increased to a similar extent in the infarct regions of both groups. MMP-9 protein levels were increased in the non-infarct region of WT-MI vs WT-sham. MMP-9 protein levels and activity were significantly lower in the infarct region of WT vs hKO. TIMP-2 protein levels similarly increased in both MI groups, whereas TIMP-4 protein levels were significantly lower in the infarct region of hKO group. Phosphorylation of p53 protein was higher, while protein levels of manganese superoxide dismutase were significantly lower in the infarct region of hKO vs WT. In vitro, inhibition of ATM using KU-55933 increased oxidative stress and apoptosis in cardiac myocytes.
Sim2 is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix PAS transcription factor gene family and is evolutionarily related to the Drosophila single-minded gene, a key regulator of central nervous system midline development. In an effort to determine the biological roles of Sim2 in mammalian development, we disrupted the murine Sim2 gene through gene targeting. Mice homozygous for the disrupted allele (Sim2 -/-) exhibit a cleft of the secondary palate and malformations of the tongue and pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone. These craniofacial malformations are the most probable cause of aerophagia (air swallowing with subsequent accumulation of air in the gastrointestinal tract) and postnatal death exhibited by Sim2 -/- mice. The developing palates of the Sim2 -/- mice are hypocellular, and at embryonic day 14.5 contain excess extracellular matrix component hyaluronan (HA) compared with heterozygotes and homozygous wild-type littermates. HA plays an important role in the regulation and mechanics of palate development. Its premature accumulation in Sim2 -/- animal palates suggests a regulatory role for Sim2 in HA synthesis and in the establishment of craniofacial architecture.
Cardiac amyloidosis produces a restrictive cardiomyopathy with impaired diastolic function. We report a case in which low-dose verapamil resulted in marked worsening of congestive heart failure, as a result of a profound negative inotropic effect. Withdrawal of verapamil therapy demonstrated a return of systolic function to normal with improvement in heart failure. We postulate that patients with cardiac amyloidosis may be exceptionally sensitive to the negative inotropic effects of calcium-channel blockers either because of abnormal binding to amyloid fibrils or because their usual vasodilator effects are blunted.
Anthracycline antibiotic (Rubidomycin and Adriamycin) are often used for treatment of acute leukemia and variety of solid tumors. The use of greater doses of these agents is mostly limited by the damage of the cardiac muscle and by heart failure. The Rubidomycin cardiac toxicity analysis of children with acute leukemia has been considered in this paper. The results were obtained by investigating 53 patients who received this drug. They were classified in subgroups in relation to the total dose administered. Acute or chronic myocardial damage appeared in 6 children. The subgroup incidence of damage is directly proportional to the total dose administered.
The aim was to compare the clinical efficacy of lansoprazole with the efficacies of ranitidine and famotidine in order to rank this drug in the hierarchy of duodenal ulcer treatments.
All randomized clinical trials in which lansoprazole was used to treat patients with duodenal ulceration were reviewed. The meta-analysis included a quality assessment for each trial. The main criterion chosen for the meta-analysis was the endoscopic healing rate at 4 weeks; other criteria were the healing rate at 2 weeks and the absence of pain at 2 and 4 weeks. Statistical methods used were the Der Simonian and Laird method and the method of Peto et al. A sensitivity analysis was performed according to the H2 blocker type (famotidine or ranitidine). Odds ratios against histamine-receptor blockers were used to compare lansoprazole indirectly with omeprazole and other drugs.
Five double-blind trials were identified including 848 patients. The mean 4-week healing rate in patients treated with lansoprazole was 85%, which was significantly higher than the healing rate in patients treated with H2-receptor blockers (75%). This difference of 10% was significant (P < 0.01) according to the Der Simonian method, and the corresponding odds ratio of 2.27 (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.2) was significant according to the Peto method (P < 0.01). There was also a significant difference in favour of lansoprazole for 2-week healing rates (mean difference 20%, P < 0.01) and for the percentage of patients without pain at 2 weeks (mean difference 8%; P < 0.02). Indirect comparisons of 4-week healing rates showed no difference between 30 mg lansoprazole and 20 mg omeprazole and confirmed that both drugs had a greater efficacy than ranitidine, famotidine, nizitidine, cimetidine or sucralfate.
This meta-analysis showed that 30 mg lansoprazole was more effective in producing healing at 2 and 4 weeks than ranitidine or famotidine. Lansoprazole also led to a greater reduction in the percentage of patients free of pain at 2 weeks. The efficacy of lansoprazole was not different from that of omeprazole.
Increasing evidence indicates that microglial activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, activated microglia may facilitate the clearance of beta-amyloid (Abeta), a neurotoxic component in AD pathogenesis. However, microglial activation comes at the cost of triggering neuro-inflammation, which contributes to cerebral dysfunction. Thus, pharmacological approaches that can achieve a favorable combination of a reduced microglia-mediated neuro-inflammation, and an enhanced Abeta clearance may be beneficial for preventing the progression of the disease. Here, we show that some newly synthesized compounds may exert such a combination of functions. Using mouse primary microglia and RAW264.7 cells, we found that some thiourea derivatives significantly enhanced microglial Abeta phagocytosis and suppressed microglial immune responses, as evidenced by the reduced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). Of note, some commercially available inhibitors for iNOS and/or COX-2, such as ibuprofen, dextromethorphan, and N(G)-methyl-l-arginine (l-NMA), show negligible effects on microglial Abeta phagocytosis. Among the thiourea derivatives, our data show that a lead compound, designated as compound #326, (1-Naphthalen-1-yl-3-[5-(3-thioureido-phenoxy)-pentyl]-thiourea) appears to be the most potent in promoting Abeta phagocytosis and in inhibiting the LPS-induced expression of iNOS and COX-2 (when used at concentrations in the low muM range). The potency of compound #326 may have beneficial effects on modulating microglial activation in AD. The structure-activity relationship indicates that the thiourea group, alkyl linker, and the hydrophobic aryl group largely influence the dual functions of the compounds. These findings may indicate a structural basis for the improved design of future drug therapies for AD.
The authors believe this to be the first case report of atrial fibrillation following pulse methylprednisolone therapy in an adult. The literature regarding the complications of pulse methylprednisolone therapy is reviewed, with particular emphasis on the incidence and pathogenesis of arrhythmias.
