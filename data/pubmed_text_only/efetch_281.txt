Recent reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System implicate sildenafil citrate in adverse emotional and aggressive behaviors. Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is widely prescribed for erectile dysfunction and acts by inhibiting phosphodiesterase Type-5, resulting in accumulation of cyclic-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Cyclic-GMP is synthesized by guanylyl cyclase that is directly activated by the messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO), formed throughout the CNS by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Elevated concentrations of cGMP have been associated with increased aggressive behavior. In addition, the potential effect of cGMP accumulation on NO-mediated behavioral and neuroendocrine function through possible feedback mechanisms remains unspecified; however, neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibition by pharmacologic agents or ablation of the gene encoding nNOS increases aggressive behavior in male mice. We tested the hypothesis that sildenafil citrate may increase aggression via its actions on cGMP and potential feedback inhibition of NO concentrations. Male C57BL/6 mice were injected with saline vehicle (0), 2, 5, 8, or 10 mg/kg of sildenafil citrate thrice weekly for 4 weeks. Latency to display aggressive behavior, frequency, and duration of aggressive behavior were recorded during neutral-arena aggression tests. No change in agonistic behavior was observed in mice during treatment with sildenafil citrate. However, sildenafil-treated mice given the highest dose were generally more aggressive 1 week post-cessation of drug treatment as compared to vehicle-treated mice. Additional investigation into potential withdrawal effects or abuse doses seems warranted.
We investigated the use of antiretroviral therapy regimens containing zidovudine or stavudine, using data from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD), a multicentre, prospective, observational study of an HIV-infected cohort in the Asia-Pacific Region.
A proportional hazards regression analysis of factors associated with the time to discontinuation of initial regimens containing zidovudine or stavudine and a logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with a diagnosis of anaemia within 6 months of commencement of zidovudine in initial or subsequent regimens were performed.
Patients who started zidovudine were more likely to stop within the first 9 months of treatment than those who started on stavudine; the reverse was true after 9 months. Anaemia (haemoglobin<or=10 g/dL) occurred in the first 6 months in 57 of 433 patients (13%) on zidovudine. Baseline anaemia was the strongest predictive factor for subsequent anaemia, and prior antiretroviral therapy (ART) experience was protective for development of anaemia.
These data support baseline haemoglobin testing and avoidance of zidovudine if the patient is anaemic. The protective effect of prior ART for development of anaemia on zidovudine supports the short-term safety of a stavudine to zidovudine switch with routine haemoglobin monitoring in this cohort. Further studies in resource-poor settings of longer term efficacy and toxicities of ART switch strategies are needed.
Quetiapine, a second-generation antipsychotic originally used in the treatment of schizophrenia, was also found to be effective as monotherapy or as an adjunctive therapy for acute mania. Delirium in patients treated with quetiapine seems to be a rare phenomenon; however, we report two patients with bipolar disorder who developed delirium when prescribed quetiapine as an adjunct to valproate for acute mania. Both had previously developed mild renal insufficiency after an episode of lithium intoxication. The delirium resolved after quetiapine was discontinued. Unexpected interactions may occur when medications are combined without being subject to controlled clinical trials.
The objective of the study was to investigate different aspects on the efficacy of three anthelmintics on cyathostomin nematodes of Swedish horses. A faecal egg count reduction (FECR) test was performed on 26 farms. Horses were treated orally with recommended doses of ivermectin, pyrantel pamoate or fenbendazole. Faecal samples were collected on the day of deworming and 7, 14 and 21 days later. No resistance was shown against ivermectin; the FECR was constantly >99%. The effect of pyrantel was assessed as equivocal in 6 farms 14 days after treatment; the mean FECR was 99%. As many as 72% of the fenbendazole-treated groups met the criteria for resistance; the mean FECR was 86%, ranging from 56% to 100%. A re-investigation of two farms where pyrantel resistance had been suspected clearly revealed unsatisfactory efficacy of pyrantel on one of these farms; the FECR varied from 72% to 89%. Twenty-six of the horses previously dosed with pyrantel or fenbendazole, and which still excreted >/=150 eggs per gram of faeces 14 days after treatment, were dewormed with ivermectin and fenbendazole or pyrantel in order to eliminate the remaining cyathostomins. A total of 13 cyathostomin species were identified from horses that initially received fenbendazole and seven species were identified from pyrantel-treated individuals. The egg reappearance period (ERP) following treatment with ivermectin and pyrantel was investigated on two farms. The shortest ERP after ivermectin treatment was 8 weeks and after pyrantel was 5 weeks. We conclude that no substantial reversion to benzimidazole susceptibility had taken place, although these drugs have scarcely been used (<5%) in horses for the last 10 years. Pyrantel-resistant populations of cyathostomins are present on Swedish horse farms, but the overall efficacy of pyrantel is still acceptable.
Suxamethonium causes prolonged apnea in patients in whom pseudocholinesterase enzyme gets deactivated by organophosphorus (OP) poisons. Here, we present a similar incident in a severely depressed patient who received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Prolonged apnea in our case ensued because the information about suicidal attempt by OP compound was concealed from the treating team.
Osteosarcoma is one of the most common malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents. Although extensive efforts have been made in anti-osteosarcoma therapy in recent decades, there are no effective low-toxicity drugs for treating patients with metastatic osteosarcoma. Hence, potent anti-metastatic osteosarcoma drugs are highly desired. In this study, we explored novel small molecular anti-metastatic osteosarcoma agents and found that columbamine (COL), an active component of the herb Coptis chinensis, inhibited the proliferation and neovascularization of metastatic osteosarcoma U2OS cells. COL effectively suppressed U2OS cell proliferation in vitro with an IC(50) of 21.31±0.38μM, with low cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies revealed that COL induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition, which is associated with attenuating CDK6 gene expression and diminishing STAT3 phosphorylation. COL did not significantly promote U2OS cell apoptosis at any of the dosages tested. Additionally, COL inhibited U2OS cell-mediated neovascularization, which was accompanied by the down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 expression and reduction of cell migration, adhesion, and invasion. Taken together, our data show that COL exerts anti-proliferative and anti-vasculogenic effects on metastatic human osteosarcoma U2OS cells with low toxicity. These results warrant further investigation of COL as a potential anti-osteosarcoma and anti-cancer drug.
Two middle-aged women developed fever and abnormal liver function tests while taking carbamazepine. In one case the fever recurred following drug challenge. There are possible links to the known immune-related effects of the drug. Carbamazepine should be considered as a cause if fever or cholestasis develops in any person taking the drug.
Ultraviolet recall (UR) or sunburn reactivation is an infrequently reported phenomenon. It is characterized by an erythematous eruption in the distribution of previous ultraviolet-induced sunburn. The timing of the eruption correlates well with the speculation that it is induced by the administration of a chemotherapeutic agent(s). The case of a young man who developed UR after treatment with etoposide (VP16) and cyclophosphamide is reported.
Topiramate is a relatively new antiepileptic drug with several putative anticonvulsant mechanisms. Among them is the ability to inhibit carbonic anhydrase, a property in common with the anticonvulsant acetazolamide. This study examined the effects of topiramate and acetazolamide on the duration of epileptiform activity and on paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus in urethane anesthetized adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Neither topiramate nor acetazolamide altered excitability in the dentate gyrus, as measured with input-output curves or induction of long-term potentiation. Topiramate increased paired-pulse inhibition, whereas acetazolamide had no effect. Both drugs dose-dependently blocked the lengthening of the duration of epileptiform activity compared to vehicle controls. These results indicate that topiramate has an anticonvulsant-related effect (increase in paired-pulse inhibition), which may contribute to its antiepileptic effect, that is not dependent on its ability to inhibit carbonic anhydrase.
Some ventricular arrhythmias can be related to a decrease in the level of potassium (K) and/or magnesium (Mg). Because adrenergic stimulation decreases serum K+ and Mg++, we decided to investigate the effects of a beta-receptor agonist, isoproterenol, on serum K+ and Mg++, and their consequences on the induction of tachycardia. Programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation was performed in 95 patients before and during infusion of 1.6 micrograms.ml-1 of isoproterenol. During isoproterenol infusion, 61 patients had no inducible tachycardias (group I) and 34 had inducible sustained tachycardias (group II): 16 of them (group IIA) had inducible sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and 18 (group IIB) had inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia. Serum K+ and Mg++ were measured at the end of stimulation in the control state and during isoproterenol infusion. The basal values in groups I and II did not differ (3.8 +/- 0.38 vs 3.86 +/- 0.39 mEq.l-1 for K+, and 20.18 +/- 2.68 vs 19.83 +/- 1.63 mg.l-1 for Mg++). Isoproterenol infusion induced a significant (P < 0.001) hypokalaemia in all groups and a decrease in serum Mg in group II: there was a significant decrease in serum Mg++ (P < 0.05) in group IIA (19.55 +/- 1.7 vs 20.4 +/- 4.6). The decrease in serum Mg++ in group IIB (18.9 +/- 1.55 vs 19.32 +/- 1.63) was not significant. However the serum Mg++ level during isoproterenol infusion was significantly lower in group IIB than in group I. In conclusion, the infusion of isoproterenol was responsible for a significant hypokalaemia, which did not explain the induction of tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
We report a case of cardiac arrest immediately following intraurethral administration of lidocaine as topical anesthesia for cystourethroscopy in an 87-year-old man. Intraurethral mucosa lesions from previous attempts at Foley catheter insertion led to a rapid elevation in the blood concentration of lidocaine. In the presence of such factors as a urethral obstruction and a high lidocaine concentration, signs of cardiovascular toxicity can occur almost simultaneously with those of central nervous system toxicity. We, therefore, recommend that spinal or general anesthesia may be better for patients with intraurethral mucosa lesions undergoing urethral procedures.
We examined the use of intraplaque injection of verapamil for the treatment of Peyronie's disease through its effects on pain, curvature, indentation, sexual function and erectile capacity.
A total of 156 men underwent treatment with intraplaque verapamil injection. Patients were assessed objectively, during dynamic penile duplex ultrasound, as well as subjectively using a questionnaire before and after initiation of the treatment protocol. Patients were also stratified by duration of disease before therapy and into 1 of 3 Kelami classification groups based on pretreatment plaque size and severity of curvature. Differences before and after treatment and among the Kelami classification groups were assessed.
Of the 140 patients who completed treatment 73 (60%) had an objectively measured decrease in curvature while 79 (62%) reported a subjective decrease in curvature during the followup interview. After treatment 111 (83%) men reported an increase in girth, 107 (80%) an increase in rigidity distal to the plaque and 92 (71%) an improvement in sexual function. Among each Kelami class curvature was objectively measured to decrease in 41%, 68% and 62% of patients in classes I, II and III, respectively. There was no significant difference in response based on duration of disease (60% improvement versus 61% improvement for disease duration of less or greater than 1 year in duration, respectively). Mean followup was 30.4 months (range 10 to 81) and there was no reported recurrence of penile deformity in those men with an initial posttreatment positive response.
Verapamil injection of Peyronie's plaques appears to be a clinically effective treatment option for pain and curvature and can contribute to subjective improvement in sexual function and erectile capacity. The low incidence of complications indicates that this therapy is also clinically safe.
The aim of the present study was to determine the sensitivity of the developing immune system to ethanol (EtOH) after exposure from postnatal day (PND) 10 onward. Adult Wistar dams and litters were exposed to EtOH via drinking water (0, 0.25, 1.5, 2.75, 4, 5.25, or 6.5% (w/v) EtOH ad libitum) and drinking water exposure of the F1 was continued from weaning until sacrifice. Immune assessments were performed at postnatal days (PNDs) 21, 42, and 70. Furthermore, Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) specific immune responses were evaluated following subcutaneous immunizations on PNDs 21 and 35. EtOH exposure affected innate immune responses, such as LPS-induced NO-production by adherent splenocytes, as well as adaptive immune responses as represented by KLH-specific parameters. The most sensitive developmental parameters included effects on maternal and pup bodyweight with calculated BMDs of 4.0% and 4.3% EtOH, respectively. The most sensitive immune parameters were affected at dose levels lower than those affecting developmental parameters and included KLH-specific immune responses, LPS-induced NO production by adherent splenocytes, and IL-10 production by ConA stimulated splenocytes. Calculated BMDs for these parameters were between 0.01% and 0.1% EtOH. A comparison of the results of this juvenile study with an extended one-generation reproductive toxicity study revealed that the juvenile study design may result in a higher sensitivity related to differences in the exposure design. These findings demonstrate the relative sensitivity of the developing immune system for EtOH exposure, the additional value of assessing functional immune parameters, and the importance of the juvenile window in developmental immunotoxicity testing.
Behavioral performances of normotensive and hypertensive adult male baboons were tested before, during, and following chronic oral dosing with nifedipine. Performances during a five-color simultaneous match-to-sample task were measured during three dosing schedules (0.20, 0.68, and 1.14 mg/kg/day) and vehicle. Each dose was administered for 21 consecutive days preceded and followed by 14-day baseline and recovery periods, respectively. Choice reaction times increased by 191 ms over baseline at the 0.68 mg/kg dose. Choice reaction times above the 95th percentile (i.e., the slowest reaction times) were the most slowed by nifedipine. Accuracy of color matching was decreased at 0.20 and 0.68 mg/kg by an average range of 2-4%. The yellow and white stimuli were the most difficult to discriminate correctly, and were also the most impaired by nifedipine. Nifedipine's behavioral effects were not modulated by blood pressure changes because daily changes in choice reaction time and systolic blood pressure were not correlated, and hypertensive status did not determine the behavioral effects. Potential sources of nifedipine's behavioral performance effects are discussed, with blood pressure changes excluded as a probable mechanism.
Lake trout embryos exposed to [(3)H]2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) manifest toxicity after hatching by subcutaneous edema of the yolk sac, pericardial edema, meningeal edema, subcutaneous hemorrhages, and a marked congestion of blood flow in various vascular beds culminating in death. Our objective was to determine if this syndrome was associated temporally with morphologic lesions in the vascular endothelium, increased vascular permeability, and cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) mRNA induction. Lake trout embryos exposed as fertilized eggs to TCDD were found to exhibit marked reductions in perfusion of the peripheral vasculature during the early sac fry stage of development (stage F(1)9), which consistently preceded other gross lesions and mortality observed later in sac fry development (stage F(2)10). This reduction in blood flow was manifested as severe capillary congestion and hemoconcentration in certain vascular beds. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examination of endothelial cells in these vascular beds failed to reveal cellular necrosis at hatching (stage E(5)8) and throughout sac fry development (stages F(1)9-F(2)10). Rather, only subtle ultrastructural changes in endothelial cells were found consisting of increased vacuolation, separation of intercellular junctions, and cytoplasmic blebbing, consistent with the TCDD dose and time course for developmental cardiovascular toxicity, which began to manifest itself in some embryos approximately 1 week prior to hatching (E(5)8). To assess permeability of yolk sac vasculature to certain constituents in blood, sac fry (stage F(2)10) were analyzed for the presence of plasma proteins, granulocytes, and serum creatine kinase activity in yolk sac subcutaneous edema fluid from control and TCDD-exposed treatment groups. TCDD dose- and time-related increases in yolk sac edema volume, plasma protein content of edema fluid, granulocyte concentration, and creatine kinase activity in the fluid were observed in midstage and late stage of sac fry development (stage F(2)10). Thus, yolk sac subcutaneous edema fluid is an ultrafiltrate of blood and results from increased vascular permeability. In contrast to the changes in vascular blood flow and permeability induced by TCDD during stages F(1)9 and F(2)10 of sac fry development, respectively, CYP1A mRNA levels were induced by TCDD as early as the 10-somite embryo (stage E(2)5). TCDD also caused a dose-related increase in CYP1A mRNA levels in sac fry at hatching (stage E(5)8) and throughout sac fry development (stages F(1)9-F(2)10). We conclude that subtle, ultrastructural changes in vascular endothelial cells consistently precede increases in vascular permeability and sac fry mortality; however, induction of CYP1A mRNA occurs prior to any observable morphological lesions, changes in vascular permeability, or sac fry mortality.
To investigate the relationship of nitric oxide (NO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) with varicocele (VC) infertility.
Fifty-three infertile men, 21 with varicocele and 32 with subvaricocele, were enrolled as Group 1, 29 infertile patients with oligoasthenozoospermia but without varicocele as Group 2 and 28 normal fertile controls as Group 3. The NO content and NOS activity in the seminal plasma and peripheral blood were measured by nitric acid reductase method, and the semen parameters of VC determined by computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA).
Significant differences were noted between Group 1 and the other two in the NO content and NOS activity in the seminal plasma (P < 0.05) but not in the peripheral blood (P > 0.05). In Group 1, the NO content and NOS activity were increased in both the seminal plasma and peripheral blood with the enhanced diameter of the varicose spermatic vein, with a significant difference only in the seminal plasma between the varicocele and subvaricocele patients (P < 0.05), and the same increase was observed with decreased sperm concentration (> or = 20 x 10(6)/ml and < or = 10 x 10(6)/ml) and motility (> or = 50% and < or = 25%), with significant differences (P < 0.05).
NO plays an important role in the VC-induced decrease of seminal quality. For the diagnosis of VC, the determination of the NO content and NOS activity in the seminal plasma is of more significance than that in the peripheral blood, and the earlier the determination, the greater its clinical value for both the diagnosis and treatment of VC.
High doses of insulin and the insulin analog AspB10 have been reported to increase mammary tumor incidence in female rats likely via receptor-mediated mechanisms, possibly involving enhanced IGF-1 receptor activation. However, insulin and IGF-1 receptor functionality and intracellular signaling in the rat mammary gland in vivo is essentially unexplored. The authors investigated the effect of a single subcutaneous dose of 600 nmol/kg human insulin or IGF-1 on Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in rat liver, colon, and mammary gland. Rat tissues were examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry by phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Insulin as well as IGF-1 caused Akt phosphorylation in mammary epithelial cells, with myoepithelial and basal epithelial cells being most sensitive. IGF-1 caused stronger Akt phosphorylation than insulin in mammary gland epithelial cells. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not influenced by insulin or IGF-1. Rather, in liver and mammary gland P-ERK1/2 appeared to correlate with estrous cycling, supporting that ERK1/2 has important physiological roles in these two organs. In short, these findings supported that the rat mammary gland epithelium expresses functional insulin and IGF-1 receptors and that phosphorylation of Akt as well as ERK1/2 may be of value in understanding the effects of exogenous insulin in the rat mammary gland and colon.
Mefloquine and artesunate combination therapy is the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria throughout much of south-east Asia. Concerns have been raised about the potential central nervous system (CNS) effects of both drug components and there are no detailed reports in very young children.
Children, aged between three months and five years, with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were randomized to either 7 days of artesunate monotherapy or the same schedule of artesunate plus mefloquine on day 7 and 8. Neurological testing targeting coordination and behaviour was carried out at day 0, 7, 9, 10, 14 and 28. Non-febrile healthy control children from the same population were tested on days 0, 7, 14 and 28.
From December 1994 to July 1997, 91 children with uncomplicated P. falciparum, 45 treated with artesunate monotherapy, 46 treated with mefloquine and artesunate combination therapy and 36 non-febrile controls, underwent neurological testing. Malaria and fever had a significant negative impact on testing performance. By contrast, the anti-malarial treatments were not associated with worsening performances in the various components of the test. Artesunate and mefloquine do not appear to have a significant influence on coordination and behaviour. Children treated with mefloquine were significantly less likely to suffer recurrent malaria infection during follow-up compared to those treated with artesunate alone (P = 0.033).
In keeping with the results of randomized controlled trials in adults, mefloquine was not associated with a decrease in specific items of neurological performance. Likewise, children treated with artesunate did not perform significantly differently to control children. This study does not exclude subtle or rare treatment CNS effects of artesunate or mefloquine. Treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria results in a significant improvement on items of neurological performance.
We have previously identified an oncogenic role of artemin (ARTN), a member of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor family of ligands, in mammary carcinoma. We herein report that ARTN is an estrogen-inducible gene. Meta-analysis of gene expression data sets showed that ARTN expression is positively correlated to estrogen receptor (ER) status in human mammary carcinoma. Furthermore, in patients with ER-positive mammary carcinoma treated with tamoxifen, high ARTN expression is significantly correlated with decreased survival. Forced expression of ARTN in ER-positive human mammary carcinoma cells increased ER transcriptional activity, promoted estrogen-independent growth and produced resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant in vitro and to tamoxifen in xenograft models. ARTN-stimulated resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant is mediated by increased BCL-2 expression. Conversely, depletion of endogenous ARTN by small-interfering RNA or functional antagonism of ARTN by antibody enhanced the efficacy of antiestrogens. Tamoxifen decreased ARTN expression in tamoxifen-sensitive mammary carcinoma cells whereas ARTN expression was increased in tamoxifen-resistant cells and not affected by tamoxifen treatment. Antibody inhibition of ARTN in tamoxifen-resistant cells improved tamoxifen sensitivity. Functional antagonism of ARTN therefore warrants consideration as an adjuvant therapy to enhance antiestrogen efficacy in ER-positive mammary carcinoma.
The authors investigated a consolidation biochemotherapy program with subcutaneous recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) and recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN alpha) biologic response modifiers (BRM) in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with responsive or stable disease to induction chemotherapy.
Patients with proven, advanced, previously untreated NSCLC were entered into the study. Induction chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin, 120 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.), on Day 1; vinblastine, 6 mg/m2 i.v., on Day 1; and mitomycin-C, 6 mg/m2 i.v., on Day 1 (PVM), every 3 weeks. Subsequently, patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) received consolidation biochemotherapy with subcutaneous rIL-2, 3 MU/m2 twice/day, and rIFN alpha, 3 MU once/day, 5 days a week, starting 2 weeks after the second PVM course. After 3 and 6 weeks of BRM treatment, patients had a 14-day rest period to intercalate consolidating PVM courses.
Seventy-seven patients were enrolled in the trial. After 2 PVM induction courses, 16 patients progressed and went off the study, whereas 61 patients were eligible for consolidation biochemotherapy. Among the 61 patients, 9 were not treated with BRM for several reasons, whereas 52 patients began biochemotherapy and were evaluable for toxicity. Furthermore, a few days after starting BRM, 9 patients discontinued therapy due to side effects; the remaining 43 patients received adequate treatment and were fully evaluable. In the 52 evaluable patients, the following BRM related toxicities were observed: World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2-3 fever in 85% of patients, asthenia in 71%, anorexia in 63%, and flu-like syndrome in 18.5%. PVM-related vomiting was present in 19% of patients. WHO Grade 3-4 myelosuppression, from both BRM and PVM (overlapping toxicity), was anemia in 16% of patients, leukopenia in 12%, and thrombocytopenia in 19%. There were three toxic deaths: two due to BRM-induced hypotension and one from pneumonia. In the 43 fully evaluable patients (23 PR and 20 SD after induction chemotherapy), after a median of 6 weeks of biochemotherapy (range, 3-16 weeks), we observed 5 of 20 patients achieving PR from SD, and 6 of 23 with confirmed PR. In these 11 patients, the median duration of response was 21 weeks (range, 7-80 weeks). Overall response improvement was 11.6% in the 43 patients and 6.4% in the 77 total enrolled patients. Median survival was 41 weeks (range, 15-173 weeks) in the 43 patients and 38 weeks (range, 1.4-173 weeks) in the 77 patients.
In this study, biochemotherapy, when administered by this dose and schedule, did not offer substantial benefit although it caused significant toxicity.
Infants exposed to opioides in-utero frequently demonstrate withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state regulation.
This study examines sleep-wakefulness-distress patterns as indicators of regulatory mechanisms at 3 months of age.
A national infant cohort (N=35) born to women in high-dose maintenance treatment during pregnancy and a comparison group (N=36) of low-risk infants born in the same period.
Distributions and frequencies of sleep, wakefulness and distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers in the two groups.
Women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood. They were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child was born. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of the 10 measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at 3 months despite of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 47% of the exposed infants and significant differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight, gestational age and maternal characteristics.
Follow-up procedures combining drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep-wakefulness patterns.
Rhabdomyolysis is a disorder in which injury to muscle results in leakage of myocyte intracellular contents into the plasma. It has been associated with a tremendous number and diversity of clinical conditions and substances. Several physiological and biochemical mechanisms for this syndrome have been described. The most likely etiology of rhabdomyolysis in patients presenting to the emergency department is ingestion of drugs of abuse, most commonly ethanol, heroin, amphetamines, cocaine, and other sedatives or stimulants. In this article, the association between rhabdomyolysis and drugs of abuse is explored, as well as its diagnosis and treatment.
Intravenous administration of a single 50-mg bolus of lidocaine in a 67-year-old man resulted in profound depression of the activity of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal pacemakers. The patient had no apparent associated conditions which might have predisposed him to the development of bradyarrhythmias; and, thus, this probably represented a true idiosyncrasy to lidocaine.
For the purpose of investigating the long-term effects of seizures in developmental rats on spatial learning ability and hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting related gene expressions in adult rat brain, a seizure was induced by penicillin quaque die alterna in Sprague-Dawley rats from postnatal day 29 (P29). Rats were assigned into the recurrent seizure group (RS, seizures were induced in 11 consecutive days) and the control group. During P51-P56, P81-P84 and P92-P95, the rats were tested for spatial learning ability with the Morris water maze task. On P95, the authors examined mossy fiber sprouting and gene expression of zinc transporters 1 and 3 (ZnT-1, ZnT-3), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha (CaMK-IIalpha), NMDA receptor 2C (NR2C) and glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) in hippocampus by Timm staining and real-time RT-PCR analysis. The escape latencies from the water maze of the rats in the RS group were significantly longer than those of the control rats at d5 of the first test, at d1 of the second test, and at d2 of the third test. In the spatial probe test, the ratio between the swim time in the third quadrant and the total swim time in control group was significantly higher than RS group (p<0.05) in the entire three probe tests. The Timm scores in CA3 and dentate gyrus in the RS animals were significantly higher than that in the control. Compared with the control rats, the expressions of ZnT-1, CaMK-IIalpha and GluR2 transcripts in the hippocampus of the RS group was significantly decreased while unchanged in transcriptional levels of ZnT-3 and NR2C. There were positive linear correlations among ZnT-3, CaMKIIalpha, and NR2C in control group and among CaMKIIalpha, ZnT-1 and GluR2 in RS group. The results suggest that recurrent seizures induced in developmental rats could cause long-term disturbance on the hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting related gene expressions, which might play an important role in long-term cognitive deficit and hippocampal aberrant mossy fiber sprouting.
