The present study was designed to investigate anti-ulcerogenic property of ethanolic extract of Desmodium gangeticum (DG) against cold restraint (CRU, 2 hr cold restraint stress), aspirin (ASP, 150 mg/kg orally), alcohol (AL, absolute alcohol 1 ml/200gm) and pyloric ligation (PL, 4 hr pylorus ligation) induced gastric ulcer models in Sprague Dawley rats, and histamine (HST, 0.25 mg/kg) induced duodenal ulcer in guinea pigs. We found that DG at a dose of 200mg/kg, (orally), markedly decreased the incidence of ulcers in all the above models. DG showed significant protection against CRU (68.37%), AL (88.87%), ASP (38.2%), PL (40.63%) and HST (63.15%) induced ulcer models, whereas standard drug omeprazole (OMZ) showed protection index of 83.86, 56.35, 70.31 and 84.21%, respectively in CRU, ASP, PL and HST models. Sucralfate as standard drug showed 92.64% protection in AL model. DG significantly reduced acid secretion 41.61%, whereas OMZ produced 43.13% reduction. Treatment with DG showed increase in mucin secretion by 56.17%, whereas OMZ showed 12.45% increase. Anti-ulcer effect of DG may be due to its cytoprotective effect along with antisecretory activity and could act as a potent therapeutic agent against peptic ulcer disease.
Increased plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels are a risk factor for stroke and can be reduced with vitamin therapy. However, data on the tHcy-lowering effects of vitamins are limited largely to white populations. Thus, we aimed to determine in Singaporean patients with recent stroke: (1) the efficacy of vitamin therapy (folic acid, vitamin B12, and B6) on lowering tHcy, and (2) whether efficacy is modified by Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism(s).
A total of 443 eligible patients were recruited after presenting with ischemic stroke within the past 7 months. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or vitamins. Fasting blood samples collected at baseline and at 1 year were assayed for levels of plasma tHcy. Patients were genotyped for MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms.
Mean baseline tHcy was similar in the 2 groups (placebo 13.7 micromol/L; vitamins 14.0 micromol/L; P=0.70). At 1 year, mean tHcy was 14.5 micromol/L in the placebo group compared with 10.7 micromol/L in the vitamin group (difference 3.8 micromol/L; 95% CI, 2.8 to 4.8 micromol/L; P<0.0001). MTHFR C677T genotype was an independent determinant of tHcy levels at baseline (P=0.005), but A1298C was not (P=0.08). Neither polymorphism significantly influenced the effect of vitamin therapy on tHcy at 1 year. The magnitude of the reduction in tHcy levels at 1 year with vitamin therapy was similar, irrespective of MTHFR genotypes.
Vitamin therapy reduces mean tHcy levels by 3.8 micromol/L in the Singaporean stroke population studied. MTHFR C677T but not A1298C is independently associated with tHcy levels at baseline, and neither impacts the tHcy-lowering effect of vitamins used in this study.
It has been shown that mitomycin-C increases the success rate of trabeculectomy; however, a rise in the incidence of postoperative complications has also been reported. Consequently, the use of antimetabolite is usually reserved for patients who are at high risk of surgical failure or for patients with advanced glaucoma in whom low intraocular pressure is desired. This report describes a patient who suffered severe visual loss which was a direct result of hypotonous maculopathy after trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C and various other complications from the subsequent interventions.
Variable degrees of acute renal failure developed in three patients receiving therapy with cephalothin sodium. The course and findings were consistent with acute tubular necrosis of the oliguric and nonoliguric types. One patient had protracted oliguria, a second experienced transient oliguria, and one had normal urine output. All had urinary sediment changes consistent with tubular necrosis, and the two oliguric patients had elevated urine sodium concentrations. No other causes for renal failure could be detected, and all recovered after discontinuation of cephalothin therapy, although peritoneal dialysis was required in one patient. These observations indicate that cephalothin is capable of inducing renal damage in man.
Thyroxine-immunofluorescence quantitative disruption test (TIQDT) was designed to provide a simple, rapid, alternative bioassay for assessing the potential of chemical pollutants and drugs to disrupt thyroid gland function. This study demonstrated that zebrafish eleutheroembryos provided a suitable vertebrate model, not only for screening the potential thyroid disrupting effect of molecules, but also for estimating the potential hazards associated with exposure to chemicals directly impairing thyroxine (T4) synthesis. Amitrole, potassium perchlorate, potassium thiocyanate, methimazole (MMI), phloroglucinol, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil, ethylenethiourea, benzophenone-2, resorcinol, pyrazole, sulfamethoxazole, sodium bromide, mancozeb, and genistein were classified as thyroid gland function disruptors. Concordance between TIQDT on zebrafish and mammalian published data was very high and the physiological relevance of T4-intrafollicular content was clearly higher than regulation at the transcriptional level of tg or slc5a5. Moreover, concentration-response analysis provided information about the thyroid disrupting potency and hazard of selected positive compounds. Finally, the effect of perchlorate, but not MMI, was completely rescued by low-micromolar amounts of iodide. TIQDT performed on zebrafish eleutheroembryos is an alternative whole-organism screening assay that provides relevant information for environmental and human risk assessments.
The reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is the mainstay of post-marketing surveillance systems. Under-reporting and selective reporting are considered the main limitations of a spontaneous reporting-based pharmacovigilance system. However, excessive reporting induced by external events may also impair signal detection by increasing the noise level.
The aim of this study was to examine the influence of regulatory measures and other external factors on the rate of ADR reporting in Italy, focusing on four situations occurring in the last 10 years: ACE inhibitor-induced cough; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') and rhabdomyolysis; nimesulide and hepatic toxicity; and cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors ('coxibs') and increase in cardiovascular risk.
The study was based on data from spontaneous reporting in six Italian regions collected from January 1995 to December 2005. We analysed a 10-year period as a reasonable time interval around the four situations of interest, highlighting the influence of regulatory measures on the rate of ADR reporting (number of reports per million inhabitants). Chi-squared tests were used to assess the statistical significance of any changes in ADR reporting. Drug sales data were also studied to examine possible changes in drug use. Sales data were expressed as daily defined dose per 1000 inhabitants per day.
ACE inhibitors: a 5-fold increase in the reporting rate of ACE inhibitor-induced cough was observed in 1998 and 1999 following a restriction on reimbursement for angiotensin receptor blockers introduced in 1998 and removed at the end of 1999. Statins: after the withdrawal of cerivastatin in 2001, the ADR reporting rate increased more than 4-fold, with musculoskeletal ADRs representing about 60% of all the ADRs reported in that year, and progressively decreased in the following years. Nimesulide: an increase in hepatic ADR reporting was observed after withdrawal of the drug from the Finnish and Spanish markets in 2002. Coxibs: no important changes in the rate of cardiovascular events reporting in the period 2000-4 were observed. In 2005, after the withdrawal of rofecoxib in September 2004, both the ADR reporting rate and sales of the drug decreased drastically.
Our data suggest that spontaneous ADR reporting can be influenced in different ways by external events. Our data emphasize the need for educational initiatives aimed at increasing the doctor's and patient's awareness of the usefulness and the limitations of spontaneous reporting in the pharmacovigilance system. Such initiatives should use appropriate risk communication strategies in order to avoid unnecessary alarm, which could cause unjustified interruption of therapies or misplaced confidence in new drugs.
Autistic disorder is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder most probably caused by a complex interaction of genetic factors. Several genomewide scans identified multipoint LOD score peaks in region 7q32. In this region, UBE2H encodes an E2 enzyme of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system. Mutations in another member of this system, the UBE3A gene, cause Angelman syndrome. The participation of E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes) or E3 (ubiquitin ligases) enzymes in neural development recently emerged. Given its physical location and function, we examined UBE2H as a candidate for involvement in autistic disorder. We confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction that the UBE2H gene was expressed in the rat and the human central nervous system. The rat UBE2H and human UBE2H deduced amino acid sequences are identical. We screened the seven exons of the UBE2H gene in autistic patients using single-strand conformation analysis. We observed a silent A-->G transition at position 336. A case-control association study was performed using this A/G polymorphism. A significant association was found between the G allele and a subgroup of autistic patients with developmental quotient higher than 30 (P=0.004). Although further studies are required, these results suggest that the UBE2H gene could be one of the 7q-susceptibility loci for autistic disorder.
Felbamate (2-phenyl-1,3-propanediol dicarbamate) has a favorable preclinical profile in animal models of epilepsy. We present the results of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with partial seizures. Criteria for entry included a requirement for four or more partial seizures per month despite concomitant therapeutic blood levels of phenytoin and carbamazepine. Fifty-six patients (mean age, 31.4 years; 32 men, 24 women) completed the trial. The mean seizure frequencies for the 8-week periods analyzed were felbamate = 34.9, placebo = 40.2. Felbamate was statistically superior to placebo in seizure reduction, percent seizure reduction, and truncated percent seizure reduction. The mean felbamate dosage was 2,300 mg/d. Plasma felbamate concentrations ranged from 18.4 to 51.9 mg/l, mean = 32.5 mg/l. Adverse experiences during felbamate therapy were minor and consisted primarily of nausea and CNS effects. This trial indicates that felbamate is safe and effective in the treatment of comedicated patients with severely refractory epilepsy.
To assess the effect of thalidomide on Trinitrobenzensulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced or oxazolone-induced colitis and discuss the possible mechanism of its action.
Transmural colitis was induced by TNBS in three groups of rats (n=6 each), and distal colitis was induced by oxazolone in three groups of rats (n=6 each). Then the rats of the groups were treated with thalidomide [200 mg/(kg x d)], prednisone [5 mg/(kg x d)] or vehicle (olive oil) respectively by oral gavage. The colitis was allowed to run its course for 7 d after gavage and at that time the following endpoints were assessed. Colitis was evaluated by macroscopic and microscopic score; the expression of NF-kappaB P65 was examined by immunohistchemical (IHC); the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA was assayed by hybridization in situ (ISH); the cytokine TNF-alpha, IL-4, IFN-gamma were estimated by enzyme-linked immunoadsordent assay (ELISA).
With respect to TNBS model, in the control, prednisone-treatment and thalidomide-treatment groups, the macroscopic and microscopic scores were 6.33 +/- 1.03, 1.67 +/- 0.82, 2.00 +/- 0.89 and 7.33 +/- 1.03, 2.67s +/- 0.82, 3.17 +/- 0.75 respectively; the expression levels of NF-kappaB P65 and TNF-alpha mRNA in the three groups were 62.45 +/- 12.38, 23.62 +/- 8.54, 34.18 +/- 9.65 and 12.42 +/- 4.63, 9.86 +/- 3.29, 4.35 +/- 1.74 respectively; the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-4, IFN-gamma were 540.32 +/- 80.76, 94.58 +/- 14.45, 486.18 +/- 68.47; 396.53 +/- 92.42, 78.45 +/- 12.69, 347.56 +/- 82.94; and 385.68 +/- 88.57, 123.68 +/- 38.15, 378.27 +/- 90.65 respectively. The results indicated that thalidomide treatment significantly reduced colonic inflammation, suppressed NF-kappaB activation,enhanced TNF-alpha mRNA degradation, inhibited the synthesis of the TNF-alpha, IEN-gamma and increased the production of IL-4. However, with respect to oxazolone model, the macroscopic score and microscopic score were 2.00 +/- 0.89, 0.33 +/- 0.52, 1.83 +/- 0.75 and 7.83 +/- 1.47, 3.33 +/- 0.82, 6.50 +/- 1.22 respectively. Thalidomide appeared not to be effective in reducing the oxazolone-induced chronic colitis.
Thalidomide may be proposed as a useful drug for Crohn's disease, but further work is needed to clarify whether it is an efficacious agent for ulcerative colitis.
Using specimens from a population-based case control study among women ages 18 to 44 years in western Washington, we assessed the relationship between carriership of a genetic clotting factor II variant (20210 G-->A) and myocardial infarction (MI). The factor II variant was previously shown to be present in 1% to 2% of the population, to increase the levels of factor II, and to be associated with venous thrombotic disease. Personal interviews and blood samples were obtained from 79 women with a first myocardial infarction and 381 control women identified through random-digit telephone dialing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to determine the factor II genotypes. The factor II 20210 G to A transition was present more often in women with MI (5.1%) than among control women (1.6%). The age-adjusted odds ratio for MI was 4.0 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 15.1). The relative risk was high when another major cardiovascular risk factor was also present, such as smoking (odds ratio 43.3, 95% confidence interval 6.7 to 281), and the risk seemed limited to those with other risk factors. These results, in which the effect of major coronary risk factors is enhanced fourfold to sixfold by the prothrombin variant, are similar to those previously reported for another genetic clotting abnormality, factor V Leiden. We conclude that factor II 20210 G to A increases the risk of myocardial infarction in young women, especially in the women with other major risk factors for coronary heart disease.
To examine the causes of sequelae or death of patients who presented them subsequently to seizures that developed during theophylline administration.
Among 334 patients who had been examined in Study (I), we extracted 56 who had sequelae or died subsequently to the onset of seizures and examined their causes.
Many patients had fever at the onset of seizures, many patients had neurologic predispositions prior to seizure onset, and only one patient was found to be free from fever and neurologic findings. At the onset of seizures, most of these patients had blood theophylline concentrations that were within or inferior to the target range (5-15 microg/mL).
We presume it necessary to pay heed to fever and neurologic predispositions in order to prevent sequelae or death that may occur subsequently to seizures that developed during theophylline administration.
The hyperactivity induced by injection of the dopamine (DA) agonist apomorphine into the nucleus accumbens of rats was dose dependently inhibited by intra-accumbal pretreatment with cholecystokinin (CCK-8) (ED50, 0.34 ng). Local treatment with the opioid antagonist naloxone antagonized this inhibitory action of CCK-8 (ED50, 18 ng), but did not change the blocking effect of haloperidol on the apomorphine-induced hyperactivity. These data show that endogenous opioids are concerned in certain interactions between CCK-8 and DA systems.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are effective in healing reflux esophagitis and relieving the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Prevention of recurrence of symptoms has become a therapeutic aim in patients with these conditions.
We investigated the effects of rebamipide, a mucosal protective anti-ulcer agent, on recurrence of reflux symptoms during PPI maintenance therapy.
Patients with esophagitis of Los Angeles classification A or B were treated with PPIs for 8 weeks. Patients with relief of symptoms were enrolled for further study. Forty-one patients were randomized to maintenance therapy with 15 mg of lansoprazole daily or 15 mg of lansoprazole and 300 mg rebamipide daily, and recurrence of symptoms was monitored over 12 months. In some patients, concentration of rebamipide and interleukin(IL)-8 expression in the esophageal mucosa were estimated.
During the 12-month period, 11/20 patients (52.4%) taking lansoprazole 15 mg daily suffered recurrence of symptoms, compared to 4/20 patients (20%) treated with lansoprazole 15 mg and rebamipide 300 mg daily (P < 0.05). Rebamipide was detected in the esophageal mucosa 90-180 min after oral administration. IL-8 mRNA expression in the esophageal mucosa of patients with rebamipide was significantly decreased compared with that of patients without rebamipide.
Combination therapy with rebamipide and lansoprazole appears to be highly effective in preventing recurrence of symptoms during long-term maintenance treatment for GERD.
Although a number of studies have examined the comorbidity of anxiety disorders and substance use disorders, much less is known about the impact of anxiety symptoms on substance use and on substance abuse treatment outcome. In the current study, we examined how self-reported anxiety levels, as measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, were related to cocaine use variables and patterns following substance abuse treatment. There were 108 patients in substance abuse treatment who met DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria for cocaine abuse or dependence who completed an assessment battery at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. State anxiety scores significantly declined from pre- to posttreatment and remained stable into the 3-month follow-up period regardless of relapse status. Trait anxiety was correlated positively with negative consequences due to cocaine use and negatively correlated with days in treatment. State and trait anxiety both were correlated positively with the Alcohol Composite Index of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). These findings suggest that elevated anxiety scores at pretreatment subside with time, do not require clinical management of associated anxiety symptoms, and may be a temporary by-product of experiencing negative consequences due to recent cocaine use.
Two patients developed acute tubular necrosis, characterized clinically by acute oliguric renal failure, while they were receiving a combination of cephalothin sodium and gentamicin sulfate therapy. Patients who are given this drug regimen should be observed very carefully for early signs of nephrotoxicity. High doses of this antibiotic combination should be avoided especially in elderly patients. Patients with renal insufficiency should not be given this regimen.
The cardioprotective effects of carvedilol were studied in a rat model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM). After immunization, rats were orally administered 10 mg/kg/day carvedilol (group C, n = 15) or a vehicle control (Group V, n = 12) for 3 weeks. On day 21, echocardiography and haemodynamic parameters, myocarditis areas, and cytokine concentrations were measured. Serum carvedilol concentrations ranged from 10.5 +/- 2.6 to 31.7 +/- 9.3 ng/ml over a 24 h period on day 20. Carvedilol decreased the myocarditis areas (23.07 +/- 1.6 versus 33.65 +/- 2.71%, P < 0.0001). The left ventricular fractional shortening and the absolute value of +dP/dt or -dP/dt were significantly higher in Group C. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and central venous pressure were significantly lower in Group C. The serum and mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta (53.58 +/- 6.42 versus 98.75 +/- 6.53 pg/ml, P < 0.0001 and 0.298 +/- 0.04 versus 0.818 +/- 0.252, P < 0.0001, respectively) and TNF-alpha (14.82 +/- 1.95 versus 29.52 +/- 3.7 pg/ml, P = 0.0008 and 0.088 +/- 0.006 versus 0.168 +/- 0.072, P = 0.0051, respectively) were markedly decreased, whereas IL-10 (24.92 +/- 2.94 versus 15.25 +/- 3.13 pg/ml, P = 0.015 and 0.302 +/- 0.022 versus 0.107 +/- 0.02, P < 0.0001, respectively) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (1.95 +/- 0.28 versus 0.52 +/- 0.10 pg/ml, P < 0.0001 and 0.112 +/- 0.009 versus 0.051 +/- 0.002, P < 0.0001, respectively) were markedly increased in the Group C. These results indicate that in rats carvedilol protects against EAM.
Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic commonly used for prophylaxis and treatment of urinary tract infections. Pulmonary and hepatic toxicity are rare side effects of this agent. The simultaneous occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis and chronic active hepatitis in a patient undergoing long-term nitrofurantoin therapy is reported. The presence of pulmonary toxicity was evidenced by infiltrates on chest radiographs and impaired diffusion capacity during pulmonary function tests. Prolonged elevation of liver enzyme concentrations together with the presence of increased antibody titers (anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody) was suggestive of chronic hepatitis, a diagnosis corroborated by liver biopsy findings. After discontinuation of nitrofurantoin therapy, the patient had a full recovery. The infiltrates initially found on chest radiographs disappeared, and laboratory parameters normalized without the need for corticosteroid therapy.
Synergy time-kill studies against 40 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains of differing resistance phenotypes were conducted. Subinhibitory concentrations of telavancin were combined with sub-MIC concentrations of other antimicrobial agents that might be used in combination with telavancin to provide Gram-negative coverage. The highest incidence of synergy was found after 24 h with gentamicin (90% of strains), followed by ceftriaxone (88%), rifampin and meropenem (each 65%), cefepime (45%), and ciprofloxacin (38%) for combinations tested at or below the intermediate breakpoint for each agent.
Plasma renin activity (PRA) was estimated in 30 patients with aluminium phosphide (AIP) poisoning (study group) admitted in shock. Ten patients in shock other than due to AIP poisoning (Group II A) and 20 normal healthy subjects (Group II B) served as controls. The PRA was significantly higher in the study group and group II A as compared to normal healthy subjects (p less than 0.001). Significantly higher PRA was found in the study group as compared to Group II A (p less than 0.001). The initial higher PRA continued to rise further in the study group but it started decreasing in Group II A as the duration of shock advanced. Continuation of shock in AIP poisoning was probably due to slow release of toxic PH3 gas, which was detected by positive silver nitrate paper test. The rise in PRA was directly proportional to the dose of pesticide consumed. There was direct relationship of mortality with increased PRA. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may have a role in combating shock in AIp poisoning.
Within the last few years intra-amniotic (i.a.) instillation of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) has become the predominant method of second-trimester abortion in Denmark. The method is employed by nearly all the gynecological departments, where approximately 500 such procedures are carried out annually. Our own investigations have demonstrated that it is necessary to be somewhat restrictive in the administration of supplementary intravenous infusion of oxytocin. It is pointed out, illustrated by four case histories, that there is a potential risk of greater or smaller quantities of i.a. PGF2 alpha accidentally passing during the procedure to the circulation of the patient. This may result in circulatory collapse, among other things, possibly as a result of acute pulmonary hypertension. A number of safety measures are suggested to minimize this risk and to ensure effective treatment should such complications occur.
Stimulation of the central cholinergic system results in generalized epileptic seizures. The goal of this study was to map the epileptogenic effects of the cholinergic agonist, carbachol injected into different sites of the basal forebrain and diencephalon of the rat brain.
Carbachol was injected directly into the brain in a dose of 1 or 3 micrograms. Seizures were assessed behaviourally on a five-stage scale with electroencephalographic controls. Seizures at stage 1 were the least severe and those at stage 5 the most severe.
Injections of high dose carbachol (3 micrograms) induced seizures from 40% of all injected brain sites. Injections of low dose carbachol (1 microgram) or isotonic saline into the same brain sites did not cause any behavioural or electrographic seizures. The majority of sites (84%) producing generalized seizures (stage 5) were concentrated in or around the zona incerta.
Within the anatomical limits of the study, the zona incerta is the area most sensitive to carbachol-induced generalized seizures.
Serum perphenazine concentrations and early resolution of psychosis were examined to determine if blood level monitoring could be used to maximize drug efficacy while limiting extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Sixty-six acutely psychotic inpatients were given perphenazine 0.5 mg/kg/day for 10 days, and their response was rated blind to blood level. Although 36 of 66 patients showed resolution of psychosis, neither perphenazine nor N-dealkylated perphenazine levels were related to global response or to Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) totals. Improvement in two individual BPRS items (hallucinations and conceptual disorganization) was related to serum perphenazine levels and suggestive of a lower therapeutic threshold of 0.8 ng/mL. Perphenazine level was not correlated with EPS; but benztropine, given only if required for serious EPS, was more likely to be used when perphenazine levels were elevated. The data suggest that higher perphenazine levels were no more effective than moderate levels but that higher levels may be associated with increased EPS; the data also suggest that individual symptoms rather than global response were associated with a lower therapeutic perphenazine threshold.
A 78-year-old woman had 4 years age received phenprocoumon as prophylaxis against thromboembolism after implantation of a left total knee prosthesis. Ten weeks later she developed hepatitis with negative hepatitis serology. 6 weeks before her latest hospitalisation a right total knee implantation had been performed and she again received phenprocoumon. She was admitted now because of cholestatic jaundice with rapid deterioration of her general state. There were no significant abnormal findings other than jaundiced skin and sclerae.
Bilirubin concentration was clearly elevated to 11.5 mg/dl, and the transaminase activities were increased, together with raised gamma-GT and alkaline phosphatase levels. The Quick value was below 8%. Hepatitis serology was positive for hepatitis A antibodies, but negative for B and C antibodies. No antigens were demonstrated. The eosinophil count was elevated in the differential blood count. Sonography showed a normal-sized liver with slightly dense echo pattern, but no evidence of abscess or dilatation of the bile duct system. Liver biopsy revealed severe acute hepatitis of viral type and discrete eosinophilic infiltration.
After all medication had been discontinued, transaminase activities decreased while bilirubin concentration rose. Thus, prednisone treatment was started (initially 50 mg/d), the dose then gradually reduced. The cholestasis parameters became normal and the patient's general state was much improved so that she could be discharged.
Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare side effect of phenprocoumon. The associated eosinophilia suggests the cause to be an allergic genesis in the sense of a hypersensitivity reaction.
Previous studies have demonstrated protective effects of mild hypothermia following acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure (ALF). However, effects of this treatment in ALF due to other toxins have not yet been fully investigated. In the present study, the effects of mild hypothermia in relation to liver pathology, hepatic and cerebral glutathione, plasma ammonia concentrations, progression of encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and plasma proinflammatory cytokines were assessed in mice with ALF resulting from azoxymethane (AOM) hepatotoxicity, a well characterized model of toxic liver injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with AOM (100 microg/g; i.p.) or saline and sacrificed at coma stages of encephalopathy in parallel with AOM mice maintained mildly hypothermic (35 degrees C). AOM treatment led to hepatic damage, significant increase in plasma transaminase activity, decreased hepatic glutathione levels, and brain GSH/GSSG ratios as well as selective increases in expression of plasma proinflammatory cytokines. Mild hypothermia resulted in reduced hepatic damage, improvement in neurological function, normalization of glutathione levels, and selective attenuation in expression of circulating proinflammatory cytokines. These findings demonstrate that the beneficial effects of mild hypothermia in experimental AOM-induced ALF involve both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
