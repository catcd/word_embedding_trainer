The primary recognized health risk from common deficiencies in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a cytoprotective enzyme for oxidative stress, is red blood cell hemolysis. Here we show that litters from untreated pregnant mutant mice with a hereditary G6PD deficiency had increased prenatal (fetal resorptions) and postnatal death. When treated with the anticonvulsant drug phenytoin, a human teratogen that is commonly used in pregnant women and causes embryonic oxidative stress, G6PD-deficient dams had higher embryonic DNA oxidation and more fetal death and birth defects. The reported G6PD gene mutation was confirmed and used to genotype fetal resorptions, which were primarily G6PD deficient. This is the first evidence that G6PD is a developmentally critical cytoprotective enzyme for both endogenous and xenobiotic-initiated embryopathic oxidative stress and DNA damage. G6PD deficiencies accordingly may have a broader biological relevance as important determinants of infertility, in utero and postnatal death, and teratogenesis.
Hepatotoxicity is a rare complication of coumarin anticoagulants. We present the case of a 56-year-old woman who developed a viral-hepatitis-like picture 8 months after mitral valve replacement and oral anticoagulation. Phenprocoumon-induced hepatitis was diagnosed after positive reexposure and improvement following withdrawal of the drug. There appeared to be cross-reactivity to warfarin since this drug led to a similar increase in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase after a few days of administration. Liver biopsy showed an acute viral-hepatitis-like picture. Anticoagulation was changed to a subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin and low-dose aspirin. Because of the widespread use of coumarin anticoagulants, physicians should be aware of the hepatotoxic potential of these drugs, which most frequently mimics the clinical presentation of viral hepatitis.
Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) develop hepatocellular carcinoma as a late consequence. Pre-loading of C57BL/10ScSn mice with iron greatly sensitizes them to the induction of hepatic porphyria caused by hexachlorobenzene (HCB). HCB will also cause liver tumors in experimental animals. Elevated liver iron stores are implicated in the development of some human liver cancers in connection with its known catalytic role in generation of highly reactive activated oxygen species. The aim of this study was to determine the lipid and DNA oxidative damage in iron and HCB-induced porphyric mice. C57BL/10ScSn mice received i.p. injections of dextran sulfate (control), iron (Imferon) or combined iron and HCB. 6 weeks after treatment plasma ALT levels and hepatic free iron, porphyrin, lipid peroxides and 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were analyzed. Hepatic porphyrin level was significantly (p < 0.001) increased following combined iron/HCB treatment as compared to control mice. The level of lipid peroxides increased 9-fold (p = 0.001) and 35-fold (p < 0.001) after iron and iron/HCB treatment respectively, whereas the level of 8-OHdG was increased 2.5-fold (p = 0.002) and 7.5-fold (p < 0.001) after iron and iron/HCB treatment respectively as compared to control mice. The authors conclude that iron overload in conjugation with HCB induce lipid and DNA oxidative damage in C57BL/10ScSn mice. DNA oxidative damage may be important in the early events of hepatic carcinogenesis in experimental porphyria.
The extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3), a secretory copper-containing enzyme, regulates angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension by modulating levels of extracellular superoxide anion. The present study was designed to determine the role of the copper transporter Menkes ATPase (MNK) in Ang II-induced SOD3 activity and hypertension in vivo. Here we show that chronic Ang II infusion enhanced systolic blood pressure and vascular superoxide anion production in MNK mutant (MNK(mut)) mice as compared with those in wild-type mice, which are associated with impaired acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in MNK(mut) mice. These effects in MNK(mut) mice are rescued by infusion of the SOD mimetic Tempol. By contrast, norepinephrine-induced hypertension, which is not associated with an increase in vascular superoxide anion production, is not affected in MNK(mut) mice. Mechanistically, basal and Ang II infusion-induced increase in vascular SOD3-specific activity is significantly inhibited in MNK(mut) mice. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis reveals that Ang II stimulation promotes association of MNK with SOD3 in cultured vascular smooth muscle cell and in mouse aortas, which may contribute to SOD3-specific activity by increasing copper delivery to SOD3 through MNK. In summary, MNK plays an important role in modulating Ang II-induced hypertension and endothelial function by regulating SOD3 activity and vascular superoxide anion production and becomes a potential therapeutic target for oxidant stress-dependent cardiovascular diseases.
Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element possessing anticarcinogenic properties and other biological functions. This study determined the role sodium selenite plays on intracellular signaling, including protein kinase C (PKC), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) in murine B lymphoma (A20) cells. In vitro supplementation of A20 cells with low concentrations of sodium selenite (0.005-5 microM) caused a significant increase in cellular proliferation exclusively at 72 h. Proliferation and cell viability were decreased in response to selenium concentrations of >/= 25 microM and >/= 5 microM at 72 and 96 h, respectively. Flow cytometric analysis of A20 cells exposed to 5 microM Se at 72 and 96 h indicated G(2)-M phase arrest and increased cell death at higher concentrations. Se-induced cytotoxicity was associated with apoptosis indicated by nuclear fragmentation and DNA laddering. Se concentrations, which induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, were associated with inhibition of cytosol to membrane translocation of PKCdelta and PKC activity at 72 h. Coincubation of cultures with 0.5 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and Se (5 and 25 microM) reversed the Se-induced cell death at 72 h. The nuclear NF-kappaB translocation and NF-kappaB DNA-binding were inhibited by increasing concentrations of Se (5 and 25 microM) at 72 h. After 72 h exposure to 5 and 25 microM Se, cIAP-2 concentration was decreased. Differential inhibition of PKCdelta, NF-kappaB, and cIAP-2 by Se may represent important intracellular signaling processes through which Se induces apoptosis and subsequently exerts its anticarcinogenic potential.
Our goal in the present study was to evaluate whether decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209), which is the most abundant polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) found in human samples, affects against target organs. Sprague-Dawley male rats were exposed to vehicle or BDE-209 (100, 300, or 600 mg/kg body weight, daily) from postnatal day (PND) 10 to PND 42. There was no significant difference in body and male reproductive organ weight changes compared with controls. However, liver, thyroid and adrenal gland weights were significantly increased in the high-dose of BDE-209 group. BDE-209 significantly induced the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2, CYP3A1, and CYP2B1) enzymes in the liver. Furthermore, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR) expression levels were also increased in a dose-dependent manner. Total serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentration was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone was significantly increased with BDE-209 treatment. In the histological findings, multiple areas of degenerated follicular epithelium and slight attenuation of the follicular epithelium were observed in the thyroid glands by high doses (300 and 600 mg/kg) of BDE-209 treatment. The presence of hepatocytic fatty degeneration and inflammatory foci were also observed in the 300 and 600 mg/kg of BDE-209 group. These findings demonstrate that BDE-209 induces hyperthyroidism and hepatotoxicity. In the future, further research is needed to determine the relationship between target organ toxicity and blood concentrations of BDE-209.
We studied whether peripheral alpha2-adrenergic receptors are involved in the antihyperalgesic effects of oxcarbazepine by examining the effects of yohimbine (selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist), BRL 44408 (selective alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor antagonist), MK-912 (selective alpha2C-adrenoceptor antagonist), and clonidine (alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist) on the antihyperalgesic effect of oxcarbazepine in the rat model of inflammatory pain.
Rats were intraplantarly (i.pl.) injected with the proinflammatory compound concanavalin A (Con A). A paw-pressure test was used to determine: 1) the development of hyperalgesia induced by Con A; 2) the effects of oxcarbazepine (i.pl.) on Con A-induced hyperalgesia; and 3) the effects of i.pl. yohimbine, BRL 44408, MK-912 and clonidine on the oxcarbazepine antihyperalgesia.
Both oxcarbazepine (1000-3000 nmol/paw; i.pl.) and clonidine (1.9-7.5 nmol/paw; i.pl.) produced a significant dose-dependent reduction of the paw inflammatory hyperalgesia induced by Con A. Yohimbine (260 and 520 nmol/paw; i.pl.), BRL 44408 (100 and 200 nmol/paw; i.pl.) and MK-912 (10 and 20 nmol/paw; i.pl.) significantly depressed the antihyperalgesic effects of oxcarbazepine (2000 nmol/paw; i.pl.) in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of antagonists were due to local effects since they were not observed after administration into the contralateral hindpaw. Oxcarbazepine and clonidine administered jointly in fixed-dose fractions of the ED(50) (1/4, 1/2, and 3/4) caused significant and dose-dependent reduction of hyperalgesia induced by Con A. Isobolographic analysis revealed an additive antihyperalgesic effect.
Our results indicate that the peripheral alpha2A and alpha2C adrenoceptors could be involved in the antihyperalgesic effects of oxcarbazepine in a rat model of inflammatory hyperalgesia.
The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) generates a high concentration of nitric oxide (NO) in tissues. Increased NO production is associated with many disorders including esophageal cancer. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated an association between increased iNOS expression and the development of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced tumors in the rat esophagus. On the basis of these observations, we initiated a bioassay to evaluate the ability of S,S'-1,4-phenylene-bis(1,2-ethanediyl)bis-isothiourea (PBIT), a selective iNOS inhibitor, to prevent the progression of esophageal tumors in rats preinitiated with NMBA. Rats were given s.c. injections of NMBA (0.25 mg/kg body weight) three times per week for 5 weeks. One week later, they were fed a synthetic diet containing either 50 or 100 ppm PBIT until the end of the bioassay (25 weeks). PBIT reduced the incidence of esophageal cancer from 96% in NMBA-treated rats to 83% and 77% (P < 0.05) in rats treated with 50 and 100 ppm PBIT, respectively. Tumor multiplicity was reduced from 3.64 +/- 0.42 tumors per esophagus in NMBA-treated rats to 1.79 +/- 0.25 (P < 0.001) and 1.50 +/- 0.24 (P < 0.0001) in rats treated with 50 and 100 ppm PBIT, respectively. PBIT reduced the production of NO in NMBA-induced preneoplastic and papillomatous esophageal lesions when compared with comparable lesions in rats treated with NMBA only. iNOS mRNA expression was not modulated by PBIT. These observations suggest that iNOS plays a role in tumor development and that its selective inhibitor, PBIT, significantly inhibits esophageal tumor progression presumably through reducing the production of NO.
Rats injected intrastriatally with kainic acid (KA), in contrast to sham-treated (control) animals, showed no tolerance toward catalepsy induced by chronic haloperidol treatment (28 days). After termination of chronic haloperidol treatment in control animals, apomorphine-induced stereotypy was significantly enhanced as compared to chronic saline-injected controls. Rats injected with kainic acid and treated with chronic haloperidol or saline showed no differences in apomorphine stereotypy. These results show that the development of tolerance and behavioural hypersensitivity after chronic neuroleptic treatment is mediated via striatal postsynaptic receptors sensitive to kainic acid lesions.
Sera from patients with a clinical diagnosis of halothane hepatitis have been shown to contain antibodies that react with liver microsomal proteins (100, 76, 59, 57, and 54 kDa) covalently altered by the trifluoroacetyl (TFA) halide metabolite of halothane. In the present study, rapid and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of these antibodies have been evaluated. A recently described method that utilizes TFA-rabbit serum albumin as test antigen was studied employing a large population of halothane hepatitis and control patients. Several problems were discovered with the assay that were not previously recognized. The assay was then compared directly with methods that utilize as test antigens either liver microsomes or purified TFA proteins from halothane-treated rats. Sixty-seven percent of patients with a clinical diagnosis of halothane hepatitis tested positive for antibodies when the test antigens were either TFA-rabbit serum albumin or liver microsomes. This value was increased to 79% when the purified TFA-57 kDa, TFA-76 kDa, and TFA-100 kDa proteins were used as test antigens. These results indicate that the specificity and sensitivity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods for the detection of patients' antibodies may be increased significantly by utilizing the purified TFA microsomal proteins as test antigens.
Excessive oxidative stress is implicated in hepatic fibrogenesis. Extracts of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Sm) have been shown to protect cells against oxidative stress. In this study we investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of Sm on hepatic fibrosis. A cell line of rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC-T6) was stimulated with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). The inhibitory effects of Sm (50-400 microg/ml) on TGF-beta1-induced alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) secretion and the mRNA expressions of fibrosis-related genes, including alpha-SMA, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), were assessed. Fibrosis was induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) administration in rats. DMN-treated rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: saline, Sm (20 mg/kg), Sm (100 mg/kg), or silymarin (100 mg/kg), each given by gavage twice daily for 5 weeks starting from the onset of DMN administration. Sm (200 and 400 microg/ml) significantly inhibited TGF-beta1-stimulated alpha-SMA secretion and the mRNA expressions of alpha-SMA, CTGF, and TIMP-1 in HSC-T6 cells. Fibrosis scores of livers from DMN-treated rats with either a low (1.8 +/- 0.2) or high (1.8 +/- 0.1) dose of Sm, or silymarin (1.4 +/- 0.2) were significantly reduced in comparison with DMN-treated rats receiving saline (3.1 +/- 0.1). Hepatic collagen contents were also significantly reduced by either Sm or silymarin treatment. The mRNA expression levels of alpha-SMA, TGF-beta1, and procollagen I were all attenuated in Sm- and silymarin-treated rats. Moreover, levels of plasma aspartate transaminase activities were reduced by Sm and silymarin treatment. In conclusion, our results show that Sm exerted antifibrotic effects in both HSC-T6 cells and in rats with DMN-induced fibrosis.
This study describes the changes in risk factors for coronary heart disease in obese persons with syndrome X after orlistat-assisted weight loss. Data were available for 1,700 patients who completed 52 weeks of weight loss; 128 were defined as having syndrome X by being in the quintile with the highest plasma triglyceride levels (>2.2 mM/L) and the lowest high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, <1.0 mM/L) concentrations. Initial characteristics of those with syndrome X were similar to the 119 subjects (non-syndrome X) in the lowest quintile of plasma triglyceride (<0.975 mM/L) and highest quintile of HDL cholesterol (>1.5 mM/L). Subjects were placed on a calorie-restricted diet, and randomized to receive orlistat or placebo. Initial values were higher in those with syndrome X for diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.03), plasma insulin (p = 0.0001), triglyceride (p = 0.0001) concentrations, and ratio of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (p = 0.0001), and were lower for HDL cholesterol (p = 0.001) concentrations. Weight loss was greater in both groups of orlistat-treated patients (p = 0.026); in those with syndrome X, it was associated with a significant reduction in plasma insulin (p = 0.019) and triglyceride (p = 0.0001) concentrations, an increase in HDL cholesterol concentration, and a decrease in low-density lipoprotein/HDL cholesterol ratio (p = 0.0001). There were no significant changes in plasma insulin, triglycerides, or HDL cholesterol concentration in the non-syndrome X group. In conclusion, weight loss attenuates coronary heart disease risk factors in obese persons with syndrome X, and the risk factor reduction is enhanced with administration of orlistat.
The role of the nucleus accumbens in the generation of the signs of morphine-induced "catatonia" namely akinesia, catalepsy and muscular rigidity, was studied in rats. Morphine was injected into the nucleus accumbens and either spontaneous locomotor activity or catalepsy or activity in the electromyogram of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle, signalling the appearance of rigidity, were recorded. Unilateral injections of 5 micrograms of morphine induced a decrease of locomotor activity and weak catalepsy; 15 micrograms of morphine completely abolished locomotor activity (akinesia) and produced a very pronounced catalepsy. All these effects were antagonized by naloxone (2 mg/kg i.p.). Injections of morphine into the nucleus accumbens did not induce muscular rigidity. In contrast, injection of morphine (15 micrograms) into the head of the caudate nucleus, which induced a pronounced muscular rigidity, did not noticeably alter the locomotor activity nor did it produce catalepsy. Our results suggest that 1) the nucleus accumbens is relevant for systemically administered morphine to produce akinesia and catalepsy, but is not noticeably involved in the development of muscular rigidity; 2) they provide evidence that morphine-induced catalepsy is largely due to a strong akinesia, and that muscular rigidity, observed after morphine administration, does not contribute to positive scores in the catalepsy test.
Under normoxic conditions, cancer cells use aerobic glycolysis as opposed to glucose oxidation for energy production; this altered metabolism correlates with poor outcomes in neuroblastoma. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) regulate aerobic glycolysis, while pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 2 (PDP2) promotes glucose oxidation. Here, we sought to determine whether gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) signaling regulates glucose metabolism.
Neuroblastoma cell lines, BE(2)-C and SK-N-AS, were used. PCR microararay for glucose metabolism was performed on GRP-R silenced cells. Target protein expression was validated using Western blotting and VEGF ELISA. Cobalt chloride (CoCl2 ) was used to induce chemical hypoxia. Efficacy of targeting PDK regulation in neuroblastoma was assessed using dichloroacetate (DCA) by conducting cell viability assays and Western blotting for apoptotic markers.
Silencing GRP-R decreased HIF-1α expression and blocked VEGF expression and secretion in both normoxic and CoCl2 induced hypoxia. PCR array analysis identified that GRP-R silencing reduced PDK4 and increased PDP2 mRNA expression. These findings were validated by Western blotting. CoCl2 induced hypoxia increased VEGF secretion, HIF-1α, and PDK4 expression. PDK4 silencing decreased HIF-1α expression and VEGF expression and secretion. DCA treatment decreased BE(2)-C and SK-N-AS proliferation while promoting cell death. GRP-R silencing and DCA treatment synergistically halted BE(2)-C proliferation.
We report that GRP-R regulates glucose metabolism in neuroblastoma by modulating HIF-1α, PDK4 and PDP2. PDK4 regulates glucose metabolism, in part, via regulation of HIF-1α. Synergistic consequences of GRP-R inhibition and DCA treatment may suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of aggressive neuroblastoma.
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has similar characteristics to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in reproduction toxicity featured by neonatal death. We found that PFOS exposure to mice during pregnancy led to intracranial blood vessel dilatation of fetuses accompanied by severe lung collapse which caused neonatal mortality. Thus, we adopted the corresponding experimental design to PFOS in order to characterize the neonatal death by PFOA. Pregnant ICR mice were given 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg PFOA daily by gavage from gestational day (GD) 0 to 17 and 18 for prenatal and postnatal evaluations, respectively. Five to nine dams per group were sacrificed on GD 18 for prenatal evaluation; other 10 dams were left to give birth. No maternal death was observed. The liver weight increased dose-dependently, with hepatocellular hypertrophy, necrosis, increased mitosis and mild calcification at 10 mg/kg. PFOA at 10 mg/kg increased serum enzyme activities (GGT, ALT, AST and ALP) with hypoproteinemia and hypolipidemia. PFOA treatment reduced the fetal body weight at 5 and 10 mg/kg. Teratological evaluation showed delayed ossification of the sternum and phalanges and delayed eruption of incisors at 10 mg/kg, but did not show intracranial blood vessel dilatation. Postnatal evaluation revealed that PFOA reduced the neonatal survival rate at 5 and 10 mg/kg. At 5 mg/kg pups were born alive and active and 16% died within 4 days observation, while all died within 6 hr after birth at 10 mg/kg without showing intracranial blood vessel dilatation. The cause of neonatal death by PFOA may be different from PFOS.
Nitrates may facilitate syncope through various pathways, but the precise mechanism of nitrate-induced syncope is still under debate. The purpose of the present study was to compare the underlying haemodynamic mechanisms in subjects without and with presyncopal symptoms during a nitroglycerin-stimulated tilt-table test.
A major decrease in systemic vascular resistance was documented in subjects with presyncope during 0.25 mg nitroglycerin-stimulated tilt-table test, in the absence of changes in cardiac output. These findings indicated that even a small dose of nitroglycerin significantly decreased arterial resistance and cardiac afterload. AIMS The mechanism of nitrate-induced syncope remains controversial. We examined the haemodynamic changes in healthy volunteers during nitroglycerin-stimulated tilt-table test.
Continuous radial pulse wave analysis, whole-body impedance cardiography and plethysmographic finger blood pressure were recorded in a supine position and during head-up tilt in 21 subjects with presyncopal symptoms (6 male/15 female, age 43 ± 3 years) after 0.25 mg sublingual nitroglycerin and 21 control subjects (6 male/15 female, age 43 ± 2 years). The drug was administered in the supine position and a passive head-up tilt followed 5 min later. Additionally, nitroglycerin was only administered during head-up tilt in 19 subjects and the haemodynamics were recorded.
Supine and upright haemodynamics were similar before nitroglycerin administration in the two groups. During the nitroglycerin-stimulated tilt test, aortic and radial mean blood pressure decreased significantly more in the presyncope group when compared with the controls (P= 0.0006 and P= 0.0004, respectively). The decreases in systemic vascular resistance (P= 0.0008) and heart rate (P= 0.002), and increase in aortic reflection time (P= 0.0002) were greater in the presyncope group, while the change in cardiac index was not different between the groups (P= 0.14). If nitroglycerin was administered during the upright tilt and not in supine position, the haemodynamic changes were quite corresponding.
Presyncopal symptoms during nitrate-stimulated tilt test were explained by decreased systemic vascular resistance and increased aortic reflection time, while cardiac output remained unchanged. These findings indicated reduced arterial resistance in nitroglycerin-induced presyncope.
Interstitial lung disease has been reported in cancer patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib. Preclinical safety studies with erlotinib did not show any evidence for an induction of injury on intact lungs in rats and dogs. In the present study, we investigated the effects of erlotinib on lung injury induced by intratracheal administration of bleomycin (BLM) in rats. In Experiment 1, we examined the effects of short-term (7- and 21-day) administration of erlotinib (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.; subtoxic dose) on the BLM (0.1 or 0.6 mg/rat)-induced lung injury of slight and moderate severity. In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of long term (up to 63-day) administration of higher-dose (up to 20 mg/kg/day; toxic dose; accompanied with decreased body weight gain and severe skin lesions) erlotinib on the BLM-induced lung injury. In rats receiving erlotinib alone, no lung lesions were noted. In rats receiving BLM alone, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and, subsequently, pulmonary fibrosis of slight or moderate severity was observed. The administration of erlotinib to BLM-treated rats showed no exacerbation of lung injuries in indices such as macroscopic findings, lung weights, histopathological scores (lung lesion density and lung fibrosis score), and pulmonary hydroxyproline (HyP) level. These results suggest that erlotinib does not have any exacerbating effects on lung injuries induced by BLM in rats.
Clinical trials have shown dexamethasone's beneficial effects on the pulmonary status of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia; however, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been a reported complication of this therapy with no known mechanism. Our study was designed to test the hypothesis that therapeutic dexamethasone doses would induce myocardial hypertrophy. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone 0.125 mg/kg/day, while paired littermate controls received saline placebo. The daily body weights were recorded and pups were sacrificed after 5 or 7 days of treatment. The heart weight to body weight ratio was used as a gross index of myocardial mass. Myocardial protein content, total protein to total DNA ratio, actin content and myosin heavy chain content were used as biochemical indices of hypertrophy. Our results included an increased heart weight to body weight ratio with elevation of the total protein content, actin content and total protein to total DNA ratio after both 5 and 7 days. We conclude that dexamethasone induces myocardial hypertrophy in neonatal rats.
The aim of our study was to detect objective signs of deterioration of motor performance in epilepsy patients treated with chronic valproate therapy.
We examined 14 controls and 15 epilepsy patients receiving chronic valproate monotherapy, who had no subjective complaints related to motor function. Regularity and maximum frequency of repetitive hand and finger movements, and simple reaction time were measured. Intensity and frequency characteristics of resting and postural tremor were assessed using accelerometry. Data were statistically evaluated.
Repetitive hand and finger movements were significantly more irregular and the maximum frequency of repetitive movements was significantly lower in the valproate group than in controls. Resting tremor peak frequency and motor reaction time of the two cohorts did not differ.
This is the first study, which quantitatively assesses motor performance of patients with epilepsy on chronic valproate therapy. The results suggest significant irregularity of repetitive hand movements and finger tapping even in patients with no motor complaints. Objective methods might help to recognize valproate-induced motor performance deterioration.
To describe trends in the clinical pattern of Reye's syndrome in the British Isles between 1982 and 1990; and to determine the relation between any changes and the June 1986 warnings against the use of aspirin in children.
Development, and application to reported cases, of a scoring system designed such that patients showing the typical clinical and pathological features of 'classical' Reye's syndrome scored highly. The relations between 'Reye scores' and a number of explanatory variables were explored using multivariable analysis.
British Isles.
445 cases fulfilling the Reye's syndrome case definition reported to the surveillance scheme between January 1982 and December 1990.
Individual 'Reye score'.
Cases with high scores were more likely to have occurred in the 4 1/2 year period before June 1986 compared with the subsequent period (p < 0.006). Numbers of cases in the low and intermediate score categories declined by about 50% after June 1986, whereas those in the high category fell by 79%. High scorers were more likely to have received aspirin (p < 0.0001) and were older than intermediate and low scorers (p < 0.008). No relation was identified between score and season of onset.
The decline in Reye's syndrome after the aspirin warnings cannot be explained entirely, as has been proposed, by improved diagnosis of 'Reye-like' inherited metabolic and other disorders: this would not account for the greater decline of the high scoring subgroup which also contained those cases most likely to resemble 'classical' Reye's syndrome and to have received aspirin. This study provides further evidence for the role of aspirin in a subset of cases meeting the standard diagnostic criteria for Reye's syndrome and supports the need to consider this disorder as a heterogeneous group of conditions including Reye-like inherited metabolic disorders.
The common wart is a common infectious disease caused by human papilloma virus. A variety of therapeutic modalities are available. Cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen) is one of the most common treatment forms. It freezes the tissue and destroys warts. Phenol is a caustic agent. Our purpose was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of cryotherapy and 80 percent phenol solution on common warts of hands.
This single-blinded clinical trial study was performed on 60 patients with common warts referred to the dermatology clinic of Ghaem Hospital Mashhad, Iran, in 2002. Patients were randomly divided into two groups; 30 patients were treated with cryotherapy and 30 patients were treated with 80 percent phenol, on a once-weekly basis until complete clearance of the lesions or a maximum duration of six weeks.
Complete clearance of warts after six weeks was observed in 70 percent of patients who were treated with cryotherapy, and 82.6 percent of patients in the 80 percent phenol group; there was no statistically significant difference between the two methods (p-value is 0.014).
Our data indicates that 80 percent phenol and cryotherapy are effective and simple treatments for common warts of hands, and patients do not experience any pain during the treatment.
Following a Clagett stage II procedure, significant amounts of neomycin are absorbed when concentrations of 0.25% neomycin (8.9 micrograms milliliter) are used. If higher concentrations are employed, the neomycin can achieve toxic levels (40 micrograms per milliliter), with associated renal toxicity and respiratory suppression. The peel of the empyema cavity does not prevent absorption of drugs. Therefore, when drugs are inserted into an empyema cavity, due care must be exerted to prevent drug toxicity.
