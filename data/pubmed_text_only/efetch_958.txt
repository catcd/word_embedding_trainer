We report imaging and clinical findings of leukoencephalopathy occurring after levamisole. The lesions were hypoattenuating on CT and appeared as multifocal oval or elliptical foci in the white matter or along the subependymal veins on MRI. Most lesions resolve after prompt withdrawal of levamisole. Detailed history taking is important for diagnosing levamisole-induced leukoencephalopathy because multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis cannot be differentiated by neuroimaging findings alone.
Macrophages express P2X(7) and other nucleotide (P2) receptors, and display the phenomena of extracellular ATP (ATP(e))-induced P2X(7)-dependent membrane permeabilization and cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. P2X(7) receptors also cooperate with toll-like receptors (TLRs) to induce inflammasome activation and IL-1beta secretion. We investigated signaling pathways involved in the induction of cell death by ATP(e) in intraperitoneal murine macrophages. Apoptosis (hypodiploid nuclei) and necrosis (LDH release) were detected 6h after an induction period of 20 min in the presence of ATP. Apoptosis was blocked by caspase 3 and caspase 9 inhibitors and by cyclosporin A. The MAPK inhibitors PD-98059, SB-203580 and SB-202190 provoked no significant effect on apoptosis, but SB-203580 blocked LDH release. Neither apoptosis nor necrosis was inhibited when both intra- and extracellular Ca(2+) were chelated during the induction period. Mepacrine, a generic PLA(2) inhibitor and BEL, an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-independent PLA(2) (iPLA(2)) blocked apoptosis, while pBPB and AACOOPF(3), inhibitors of secretory and Ca(2+)-dependent PLA(2) respectively, had no significant effect. Cycloxygenase inhibitors had no effect on apoptosis, while the inhibitors of lipoxygenase (LOX) and leukotriene biosynthesis nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), zileuton, AA-861, and MK-886 significantly decreased apoptosis. Neither NDGA nor MK-886 blocked apoptosis of 5-LOX(-/-) macrophages. CP-105696 and MK-571, antagonists of leukotriene receptors, had no significant effect on apoptosis. None of the inhibitors of PLA(2) and LOX/leukotriene pathway had a significant inhibitory effect on LDH release. Our results indicate that a Ca(2+)-independent step involving an iPLA(2) and 5-LOX are involved in the triggering of apoptosis but not necrosis by P2X(7) in macrophages.
The prevalence of methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine misuse and abuse was examined in 450 adolescents referred for substance abuse treatment. Twenty three percent reported nonmedical use of these substances and six percent were diagnosed as methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine abusers. Abuse was more common in individuals who were out of school and had an eating disorder. Methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine abuse appears to be much less common than abuse of most other substances. It does occur, however, and parents and schools need to exert greater control over the dispensing of these medications. Physicians are advised to prescribe non-stimulant medications (eg, bupropion) when treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in substance-abusing individuals.
Evidence indicates that the high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfraction containing apolipoprotein A-I without apolipoprotein AII (LP-AI) is more antiatherogenic than HDL particles containing apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-II (LP-AI+AII). This study examined the effect of extended-release niacin (niacin-ER) and gemfibrozil on LP-AI and LP-AI+AII particles in patients with low levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Mechanisms by which these agents modulate HDL particles were investigated by in vitro studies using human hepatoblastoma (Hep G2) cells. A total of 139 patients with low HDL-C (</=40 mg/dL) were randomized to niacin-ER or gemfibrozil in a multicenter double-blind trial. Patients were dose-escalated with once-nightly niacin-ER (1 to 2 g) or gemfibrozil (1.2 g) for 19 weeks. Niacin-ER had a greater effect in raising HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I levels than did gemfibrozil. Niacin-ER at 1- and 2-g doses increased LP-AI levels by 8.7+/-4.0% (P=0.033) and 24.0+/-4.4% (P<0.001), respectively. Gemfibrozil had no consistent effect on LP-AI levels. LP-AI+AII levels increased 5% to 8% by both agents. In vitro studies showed that niacin, but not gemfibrozil, selectively decreased the uptake of (125)I-labeled LP-AI holoparticles by Hep G2 cells. The uptake of [(3)H]cholesterol ester was approximately 75% greater from LP-AI versus LP-AI+AII particles, but neither niacin nor gemfibrozil affected cholesterol ester uptake. These data indicate that unlike gemfibrozil, niacin selectively increases LP-AI compared with LP-AI+AII particle concentration in patients with low HDL-C levels. The mechanism of action of increased LP-AI concentration appears to be mediated by decreased hepatic removal of LP-AI particles, which are more efficient in reverse cholesterol transport, thus suggesting an additional mechanism by which niacin mediates its antiatherogenic properties.
The occurrence during phlebography of massive intravascular coagulation involving the inferior vena cava, the right cardiac cavities and the entire pulmonary arterial network suggested that epsilon-aminocaproic acid administered before phlebography was responsible for this complication. The mechanisms of reactions to contrast media are still poorly understood, but these reactions are known to include, in some cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation. This phenomenon was histologically demonstrated in our patient, and it may be suggested that its strong enhancement by the antifibrinolytic agent had resulted in the fatal accident. In view of the possibility of such lethal reactions, the advisability of administering epsilon-aminocaproic acid--a drug widely used in France for the prevention and treatment of contrast media reactions--should be reconsidered.
The accumulated evidence suggests that the overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) is involved in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neurotoxicity. Using NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) antibody immunohistochemistry, the possible overexpression of nNOS and iNOS was investigated in the brains of mice treated with METH. The number of positive cells or the density of positive fibers was assessed at 1 h, 24 h and 1 week after METH injections. There were no clear positive iNOS cells and fibers demonstrated in the brains of mice after METH treatment. In contrast, METH caused marked increases in nNOS in the striatum and hippocampus at 1 and 24 h post-treatment. The nNOS expression normalized by 1 week. There were no statistical changes in nNOS expression in the frontal cortex, the cerebellar cortex, nor in the substantia nigra. These results provide further support for the idea that NO is involved in the neurotoxic effects of METH.
Among the side-effects attributed to valproic acid (VPA), the occurrence of Parkinsonian syndromes and cognitive impairment is very uncommonly reported. We describe five cases of reversible associated Parkinsonism. These cases were observed in epileptic patients, 57 to 74 years old, two women and three men. Extrapyramidal disorders appeared after various durations of treatment (from 6 months to 10 years). Dementia characterized by an insidious onset was associated in three cases and bradypsychia in one case. Brain pseudoatrophy was present in three patients. In all cases the signs and symptoms improved some weeks or months after discontinuation of VPA. In the literature some cases, usually in young adults or children, have been reported. In a prospective study, Armon et al. found various abnormal symptoms and signs related to motor and cognitive function impairment in patients with long-term VPA therapy. These side-effects may be related to a disturbance in the gabaergic pathways in the basal ganglia system. It is of interest to consider that delta 2-valproic acid, a metabolite of VPA, is especially accumulated in selected areas of the brain: the substantia nigra, superior and inferior colliculus, hippocampus and medulla.
Cigarette smoking is responsible for 5 million deaths worldwide each year, and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and lung diseases. Cigarette smoke contains a complex mixture of over 4000 chemicals containing 10(15) free radicals. Studies show smoke is perceived by cells as an inflammatory and xenobiotic stimulus, which activates an immune response. The specific cellular mechanisms driving cigarette smoke-induced inflammation and disease are not fully understood, although the innate immune system is involved in the pathology of smoking related diseases.
To address the impact of smoke as an inflammagen on the innate immune system, THP-1 cells and Human PBMCs were stimulated with 3 and 10% (v/v) cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 8 and 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted and the transcriptome analysed using Illumina BeadChip arrays. In THP-1 cells, 10% CSE resulted in 80 genes being upregulated and 37 downregulated by ≥1.5 fold after 8 hours. In PBMCs stimulated with 10% CSE for 8 hours, 199 genes were upregulated and 206 genes downregulated by ≥1.5 fold. After 24 hours, the number of genes activated and repressed by ≥1.5 fold had risen to 311 and 306 respectively. The major pathways that were altered are associated with cell survival, such as inducible antioxidants, protein chaperone and folding proteins, and the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway.
Our results suggest that cigarette smoke causes inflammation and has detrimental effects on the metabolism and function of innate immune cells. In addition, THP-1 cells provide a genetically stable alternative to primary cells for the study of the effects of cigarette smoke on human monocytes.
A patient with rheumatoid arthritis developed hepatic veno-occlusive disease following the use of azathioprine. Although azathioprine induced veno-occlusive disease is suspected to occur more frequently in patients with autoimmune dysfunction, it has not previously been reported as a complication of treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. The mechanism responsible for this condition remains unknown.
Pretreatment with small, per se ineffective doses of the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390 inhibited hyperactivity induced by cocaine. On the other hand, the classic neuroleptic haloperidol and the selective D2 antagonist metoclopramide prevented the stimulatory effects of cocaine on locomotion only at hypokinetic doses, while the atypical neuroleptic (-)-sulpiride, a selective D2 antagonist, did not produce significant effects when administered at the hypokinetic dose of 12 mg/kg. Finally, at low doses (-)-sulpiride dose-dependently potentiated the locomotor-stimulating effects of cocaine, an effect that is not shared either with haloperidol or with metoclopramide. These results are discussed in terms of different roles of DA receptor subtypes in the modulation of the stimulant effects of cocaine on locomotion.
Water immersion-restraint induced the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) in the epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells of gastric wall of rats, in addition to its well-known effects of mucosal erosion. Pretreatment with a prostacyclin analog (beraprost), a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole) or a histamine H2 receptor antagonist (famotidine) prevented formation of gastric mucosal erosion, while only the prostacyclin analog inhibited expression of IEGs. The prostacyclin analog may prevent mucosal damages as well as molecular changes by ameliorating the mucosal microcirculation, and may have potential therapeutic applications.
Despite extensive research, the five-year survival rate of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients has not improved. Effective treatment of OSCC requires the identification of molecular targets and signaling pathways to design appropriate therapeutic strategies. Several genes from the mTOR signaling pathway are known to be dysregulated in a wide spectrum of cancers. However, not much is known about the involvement of this pathway in tumorigenesis of OSCC. We therefore investigated the role of the tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and TSC2, and other members of this pathway in tumorigenesis of OSCC.
Expression of genes at the RNA and protein levels was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. Loss of heterozygosity was studied using matched blood and tumor DNA samples and microsatellite markers from the TSC1, TSC2 and PTEN candidate regions. The effect of promoter methylation on TSC gene expression was studied by treating cells with methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine. Methylation status of the TSC2 promoter in tissue samples was examined by combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA).
The semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed downregulation of TSC1, TSC2, EIF4EBP1 and PTEN, and upregulation of PIK3C2A, AKT1, PDPK1, RHEB, FRAP1, RPS6KB1, EIF4E and RPS6 in tumors. A similar observation was made for AKT1 and RPS6KB1 expression in tumors at the protein level. Investigation of the mechanism of downregulation of TSC genes identified LOH in 36.96% and 39.13% of the tumors at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci, respectively. No mutation was found in TSC genes. A low LOH rate of 13% was observed at the PTEN locus. Treatment of an OSCC cell line with the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine showed a significant increase in the expression of TSC genes, suggesting methylation of their promoters. However, the 5-azacytidine treatment of non-OSCC HeLa cells showed a significant increase in the expression of the TSC2 gene only. In order to confirm the results in patient tumor samples, the methylation status of the TSC2 gene promoter was examined by COBRA. The results suggested promoter hypermethylation as an important mechanism for its downregulation. No correlation was found between the presence or absence of LOH at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci in 50 primary tumors to their clinicopathological variables such as age, sex, T classification, stage, grade, histology, tobacco habits and lymph node metastasis.
Our study suggests the involvement of TSC genes and other members of the mTOR signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of OSCC. LOH and promoter methylation are two important mechanisms for downregulation of TSC genes. We suggest that known inhibitors of this pathway could be evaluated for the treatment of OSCC.
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an environmental contaminant known to induce developmental toxicity in animal models through activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Previously, it was demonstrated that in ovo exposure to PFOA induced cardiotoxicity in chicken embryos and hatchlings. To investigate potential PPARα-mediated mechanisms, fertile chicken eggs were injected prior to incubation with WY 14,643, a PPARα agonist. Cardiac morphology and function were evaluated in late-stage embryos and hatchlings. Histologically, unlike PFOA, WY 14,643 did not induce thinning of the right ventricular wall. Via echocardiography, however, WY 14,643 induced effects similar to those of PFOA, including increased left ventricular wall thickness and mass, elevated heart rate, ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and decreased stroke volume. Additionally, to investigate mechanisms associated with early heart development, a separate group of fertile chicken eggs was injected prior to incubation with PFOA or WY 14,643 and in early-stage embryos, gene expression and protein concentration associated with the bone morphogenic protein (BMP2) pathway were determined. Although changes were not statistically consistent among doses, expression of BMP2, Nkx2.5, and GATA4 mRNA in early embryos was altered by PFOA exposure; however, protein concentrations of these targets were not markedly altered by either PFOA or WY 14,643. Protein levels of pSMAD1/5, a transcriptional regulator stimulated by BMPs, were altered by both PFOA and WY 14,643, but in different directions; PFOA reduced cytoplasmic pSMAD1/5, whereas WY 14,643 decreased nuclear pSMAD1/5. Taken together, these data suggest that developmental cardiotoxicity induced by PFOA likely involves both PPARα and BMP2 pathways.
The effects of 300 micrograms of oral clonidine were studied in nine patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis proved by selective renal arteriography. Blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity (PRA) levels, plasma noradrenaline levels, and sedation were measured before and for eight hours after dosage. After clonidine administration, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell within the first hour, was maximum in the fourth hour, and remained lower than predosage levels even in the eighth hour. There was a fall in heart rate, maximum in the fourth hour. There were minimal changes in PRA levels after giving the clonidine. Plasma noradrenaline levels fell, with the maximum fall in the sixth hour. Sedation occurred within one hour of dosage and was maximum in the second hour. We conclude that in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis clonidine causes a substantial and prolonged fall in blood pressure not accompanied by suppression of PRA levels but by a reduction in plasma noradrenaline levels. This suggests a role for central pressor mechanisms, probably linked to angiotensin II and central sympathetic activation, in the maintenance of hypertension in patients with renal artery stenosis.
In adverse reactions with shock, tripled tryptase values can support a diagnosis of anaphylaxis. A 51-year old physically fit woman experienced angio-oedema and hypotensive shock after irbesartan ingestion requiring noradrenaline infusion. Serum tryptase rose to three times the normal value. Total immunoglobulin E and skin prick tests were normal, however. As nonallergic increases in tryptase have been observed, e.g. during angio-oedema from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and bradykinin itself can degranulate mast cells acutely, we interpret the reaction as a class effect. To our knowledge, our report is one of the first on shock and angio-oedema from irbesartan.
Recent studies have identified exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) as a risk factor for deficits in cognitive functioning seen in children as well as adults. Additionally, similar alterations in learning and memory have also been observed in animal models of PBDE exposure. However, given these findings, the molecular alterations that may underlie these neurobehavioral endpoints have not been identified. As the frontal cortex is involved in modulating several cognitive functions, the purpose of our study was to investigate the possible changes to the GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems located in the frontal cortex following exposure to the PBDE mixture, DE-71. Primary cultured neurons isolated from the frontal cortex showed a dose-dependent reduction in neurons as well as neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, evaluation of DE-71 neurotoxicity in the frontal cortex using an in vivo model showed alterations to specific proteins involved in mediating GABA and glutamate neurotransmission, including GAD67, vGAT, vGlut, and GABA(A) 2α receptor subunit. Interestingly, these alterations appeared to be preferential for the GABA and glutamate systems located in the frontal cortex. These findings identify specific targets of PBDE neurotoxicity and provide a possible molecular mechanism for PBDE-mediated neurobehavioral deficits that arise from the frontal cortex.
Fifteen patients with essential hypertension and ten with pheochromocytoma were studied to assess the effect of clonidine, a centrally acting antihypertensive agent, on the functional and biochemical indices of sympathetic function. Single oral doses of clonidine (0.3 mg) decreased supine plasma norepinephrine significantly in essential hypertension, but not in pheochromocytoma despite producing similar reductions in blood pressure and heart rate. Plasma renin activity was unchanged in both groups. In untreated essential hypertension, head-up tilt increased diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma norepinephrine. Three hours after a single oral dose of clonidine, head-up tilt resulted in significant blood pressure reductions, although heart rate and plasma norepinephrine increased dramatically. Clonidine might reduce blood pressure by inhibiting sympathetic outflow, and any effect on plasma renin activity appears unimportant in its antihypertensive action. In pheochromocytoma clonidine decreases blood pressure without altering plasma norepinephrine, which is consistent with the concept that the norepinephrine released from axon terminals of sympathetic postganglionic neurons is biologically more significant than circulating catecholamines.
The study aimed to compare the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activities of Curcuma wenyujin Y.H. Chen et C. Ling (Curcuma wenyujin) and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Scutellaria baicalensis). This study used three parts to compare the two herbs. Firstly, animals were randomly divided into a Scutellaria baicalensis group, a Curcuma wenyujin group, an indomethacin group, and a model-control group to perform an ear edema test, a carrageenin-induced paw edema test, a cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation test, and an acetic acid-induced writhing test. Secondly, model rats with pelvic inflammation were established, and the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in each group was detected with the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Thirdly, pharmacokinetics analysis of Scutellaria baicalensis and Curcuma wenyujin was conducted on the model rats. The ear edema test, carrageenin-induced paw edema test, cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation test, and acetic acid-induced writhing test all showed that Curcuma wenyujin had stronger anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects than Scutellaria baicalensis. There is significant difference between the effects of Curcuma wenyujin and Scutellaria baicalensis on the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 for the model rats. Curcuma wenyujin decreased the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 more than Scutellaria baicalensis. The pharmacokinetics analysis showed that curcumol's Tmax, Cmax, and the area under the curve (AUC) were all higher than baicalin's. This study indicated that for pelvic inflammation, Curcuma wenyujin had better anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects than Scutellaria baicalensis.
The case of a 40-year-old patient who underwent an unsuccessful cadaver kidney transplantation and was treated with ethambutol and isoniazid is reported. A bilateral retrobulbar neuropathy with an unusual central bitemporal hemianopic scotoma was found. Ethambutol was stopped and only small improvement of the visual acuity followed. Isoniazid was discontinued later, followed by a dramatic improvement in the visual acuity. The hazards of optic nerve toxicity due to ethambutol are known. We emphasize the potential danger in the use of ethambutol and isoniazid.
We have conducted a double-blind, randomized study in two groups of 20 patients each, undergoing hip surgery during spinal anaesthesia, to compare the incidence of urinary retention after spinal morphine or clonidine. Patients received 0.5% spinal bupivacaine 15 mg combined with either clonidine 75 micrograms or morphine 0.2 mg. After operation, patients were examined for micturition, bladder distension, or both; when they failed to void, they received naloxone 0.2 mg, and if bladder distension persisted, a catheter was inserted. At 12 h, all patients in the morphine group but only five in the clonidine group had bladder distension, and at 24 h this was present in seven and one patient in the morphine and clonidine groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Naloxone was given in 16 and one, and a catheter was placed in one and six patients in the morphine and clonidine groups, respectively (P < 0.001). We conclude that spinal clonidine impaired bladder function to a lesser extent than morphine.
This study examined the pathological complete response (pCR) rate and safety of sequential gemcitabine-based combinations in breast cancer. We also examined gene expression profiles from tumour biopsies to identify biomarkers predictive of response. Indian women with large or locally advanced breast cancer received 4 cycles of gemcitabine 1200 mg m(-2) plus doxorubicin 60 mg m(-2) (Gem+Dox), then 4 cycles of gemcitabine 1000 mg m(-2) plus cisplatin 70 mg m(-2) (Gem+Cis), and surgery. Three alternate dosing sequences were used during cycle 1 to examine dynamic changes in molecular profiles. Of 65 women treated, 13 (24.5% of 53 patients with surgery) had a pCR and 22 (33.8%) had a complete clinical response. Patients administered Gem d1, 8 and Dox d2 in cycle 1 (20 of 65) reported more toxicities, with G3/4 neutropenic infection/febrile neutropenia (7 of 20) as the most common cycle-1 event. Four drug-related deaths occurred. In 46 of 65 patients, 10-fold cross validated supervised analyses identified gene expression patterns that predicted with >or=73% accuracy (1) clinical complete response after eight cycles, (2) overall clinical complete response, and (3) pCR. This regimen shows strong activity. Patients receiving Gem d1, 8 and Dox d2 experienced unacceptable toxicity, whereas patients on other sequences had manageable safety profiles. Gene expression patterns may predict benefit from gemcitabine-containing neoadjuvant therapy.
Indapamide is an antihypertensive agent similar to thiazides, but with some different effects. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are useful in preventing recurrent urinary stone formation due to their hypocalciuric effects.
To determine the hypocalciuric and other effects on certain laboratory parameters of indapamide 1.5 mg in different patient groups.
Four groups of patients recruited from urology and nephrology outpatient departments were experiencing non-hypercalciuric urinary stone disease (group 1), idiopathic hypercalciuria (group 2), urinary stone disease with hypercalciuria (group 3), and essential hypertension (group 4). In all patients, fasting serum uric acid, calcium, sodium, potassium, cholesterol, triglyceride, parathyroid hormone (PTH) values, and morning second-spot urine calcium and creatinine levels were assessed before and 8 weeks after treatment with indapamide.
Urinary calcium excretion was reduced significantly in all groups: group 1 from 0.10 +/- 0.02 to 0.07 +/- 0.03 (mean +/-SD; 30% reduction; p < 0.001), group 2 from 0.30 +/- 0.15 to 0.15 +/- 0.10 (50% reduction; p < 0.001), group 3 from 0.35 +/- 0.15 to 0.20 +/- 0.10 (43% reduction; p < 0.001), and group 4 from 0.10 +/- 0.03 to 0.08 +/- 0.02 (20% reduction; p < 0.0010). These results should be interpreted with caution since no control group was included in this study. Mean serum uric acid and triglyceride levels were significantly increased, and mean PTH and potassium levels and diastolic and systolic blood pressure were significantly decreased in all groups. Few temporary adverse effects, such as dizziness and fatigue, were noticed and none of them caused discontinuation of treatment.
Indapamide 1.5 mg/day is effective in decreasing calciuria in patients with non-hypercalciuric urinary stone disease, idiopathic hypercalciuria, urinary stone disease with hypercalciuria, and essential hypertension. This could be achieved with few adverse effects similar to those of thiazides and indapamide 2.5 mg. Indapamide decreased the PTH levels in all groups. Long-term clinical benefits of these effects should be evaluated prospectively with further randomized studies.
We evaluated the expression of two extra-cellular protease systems in a model of spontaneous cerebrovascular pathology: spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP). The appearance of brain damage in individual animals was imaged and followed by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In situ zymography of brain slices obtained 3 days after the appearance of brain damage showed an increase in plasminogen activator (PA)/plasmin activity that co-localised with the cerebral damage detected by MRI; there was also concomitant accumulation/activation of inflammatory cells in the damaged area. Proteolytic activity was inhibited by the urokinase-specific inhibitor amiloride but not by an antibody against tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). SDS-PAGE zymography of brain extracts revealed the presence of 58 kDa plasminogen-dependent lysis areas in the ischemic and non-ischemic tissues, and a 33 kDa lysis area in ischemic tissue only. An antibody against t-PA inhibited the former, whereas the latter was inhibited by amiloride. The specific induction of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) in the damaged tissue was further confirmed by the fact that both u-PA protein mass and mRNA were markedly increased in the damaged cerebral areas. Concomitant metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activation was only observed in the damaged area. These data suggest that u-PA is expressed and selectively catalyses proteolysis in the injured area of spontaneous brain damage in SHRSP.
Oxidant/antioxidant balance is suggested to be an important factor for the recurrence and progression of ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of the study is to investigate the potential protective role of resveratrol (Res) against dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced oxidative damage in colon of mice with UC.
UC was induced in mice by oral administration of synthetic DSS (molecular weight 5000) for 7 days. Mice were divided into normal group, colitis control group, low-dose Res-treated group (RLD-treated group), and high-dose Res-treated group (RHD-treated group). Inhibitory effects of concomitant treatment with Res were assessed daily using a Disease Activity Index (DAI) and severity of histological changes. MDA, MPO, SOD and GSH-PX activity of colonic tissue were determined in colon samples by chemical colorimetry. TNF-alpha, IL-8, IFN-gamma, p22(phox) and gp91(phox) expression levels were detected using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), ELISA, and Western blot analysis.
Administration of Res significantly inhibited the severity of UC compared to the colitis control group. Colonic tissue MDA and MPO activities decreased significantly in Res-treated groups compared to colitis control groups. Furthermore, colonic tissue SOD and GSH-Px activities increased significantly in Res-treated groups compared to colitis control groups. The expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-8, IFN-gamma, p22(phox), and gp91(phox) also decreased significantly in the Res-treated group compared to the colitis control group.
Oral administration of Res exerts marked inhibitory effects on UC in mice. Resveratrol may play an important role in preventing DSS-induced oxidative damage.
