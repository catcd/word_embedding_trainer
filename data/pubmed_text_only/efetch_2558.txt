The overall incidence of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction ranges from 2% to 24%. One third to half of patients with hypothyroidism have anemia due to some decrease in normal red blood cell mass and erythropoietin (EPO) resistance. Therefore, for patients with chronic renal disease under medication with amiodarone, early regular thyroid function test should be checked in order to avoid amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism and EPO-resistant anemia. If amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism and EPO-resistant anemia occur in patients with chronic renal failure, early thyroxine should be given instead of waiting for spontaneous recovery by amiodarone discontinuation only. Here, we report a patient with chronic renal failure who developed EPO-resistant anemia after amiodarone treatment for arrhythmia. The hemoglobin level responded to EPO therapy rapidly after thyroxine administration and amiodarone discontinuation.
Mechanisms of chest pain in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are poorly understood. The recent demonstration in healthy subjects that lower esophageal acid exposure induces pain hypersensitivity within the non-acid-exposed upper esophagus (secondary allodynia) raises the possibility that an increase in spinal neuronal excitability (i.e., central sensitization) contributes to chest pain in GERD. The aim of this study was to determine whether in patients with unexplained chest pain, acid reflux contributes to esophageal pain hypersensitivity.
In 14 patients with chest pain and GERD and 8 healthy volunteers, electrical pain thresholds (PT) were recorded from the upper esophagus before, and then repeatedly for 90 min after either hydrochloric acid (0.15 M) or saline (0.15 M) infusion into the lower esophagus. Six patients underwent a repeat study after 6 wk of high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
GERD patients had lower resting upper esophageal PT than in healthy subjects (40.8 +/- 9 mA and 70.4 +/- 11 mA, respectively; p= 0.018). Acid infusion reduced PT in the non-acid-exposed upper esophagus in healthy subjects, but not in the patients (area under curve [AUC] - 304 +/- 333 and 786 +/- 464; p= 0.03, respectively). Following PPI therapy, resting PT increased (34.65 +/- 13.4 to 40.5 +/- 12.5 mA; p= 0.03), and a reduction in PT now occurred in acid infusion (AUC - 369 +/- 321; p= 0.03).
Patients with unexplained chest pain and occult GERD have esophageal pain hypersensitivity that is PPI responsive. The increase in resting PT and secondary allodynia only following PPI therapy suggests that pain hypersensitivity in these GERD patients may partially be the result of central sensitization.
The goal of our work was the design of DNA-damaging agents that disrupt both DNA repair and signaling pathways in prostate tumor cells. A DNA alkylator (N,N-bis-2-chloroethyl aniline) was linked to a steroid ligand (17beta-hyroxy-estra-Delta(4(5),9(10))-3-one) to produce a complex molecule (11beta-dichloro) that forms DNA adducts that bind the androgen receptor (AR). We speculated that DNA adducts in an AR-DNA adduct complex would be camouflaged from DNA repair proteins that would otherwise remove the adducts in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, transcription dependent on the AR would be antagonized by AR redistribution to sites distant from AR-driven promoters. The anticancer potential of 11beta-dichloro was demonstrated against prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. 11beta-dichloro induces a unique pattern of gene disruption, induces apoptosis in apoptosis-resistant cells, and shows promising anticancer activity in animals.
The substituted phenylpiperidine (-)-OSU6162 is a novel modulator of the dopaminergic systems with low affinity for dopamine D(2) receptors and potent normalizing effects on l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. We studied the effects of coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 with l-DOPA on the regulation of striatal preproenkephalin (PPE) and prodynorphin (PDyn) mRNA expression in the primate brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Common marmoset monkeys sustaining unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway received l-DOPA/carbidopa, l-DOPA/carbidopa plus (-)-OSU6162, or vehicle over 14 days. In vehicle-treated animals, PPE mRNA levels were markedly increased in the sensorimotor territory of the lesioned striatum. By contrast, a rather uniform lesion-induced reduction of PDyn mRNA levels was found in the vehicle group. Subchronic l-DOPA treatment induced a further increase in PPE mRNA expression in a number of sensorimotor and associative subregions of the denervated striatum. Coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 with l-DOPA partially reversed the lesion- and l-DOPA-induced elevation of PPE expression and, by affecting PPE mRNA expression differentially on the intact and lesioned striatum, markedly reduced the side-to-side difference in PPE mRNA expression. The effects on PPE mRNA expression were apparent throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the putamen and the dorsal portions of the caudate nucleus. l-DOPA treatment resulted in an enhancement in PDyn mRNA expression in all functional compartments of the striatum. Coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 had no apparent influence on these l-DOPA-induced changes in PDyn mRNA expression. The present results suggest that (-)-OSU6162 acts primarily by modifying striatal output via the indirect pathway.
Advanced-stage low-grade lymphoma is characterized by initial responsiveness to many conventional therapies but ultimate relapse. Intensive therapy approaches with non-cross-resistant regimens have not been extensively explored. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to monitor for the presence of cells with rearrangement of bcl-2, and provides a sensitive and stringent parameter of disease activity and treatment response that may have clinical utility.
From 1988 to 1992, 138 evaluable patients were treated with 3 sequential chemotherapy regimens, as well as with interferon alfa 2b (IFN) in combination with corticosteroids. Nineteen patients had serial PCR monitoring for bcl-2 rearrangement.
Among a subset of 58 patients who had an initial phase of IFN plus prednisone, the response rate was 59%, mostly partial remissions (PR). With the chemotherapy program, 65% have achieved complete remission to date, and 30% PR. By PCR analysis, 13 of 19 tested achieved negative status ('molecular remission'), a much higher frequency of molecular remission than has been seen with standard therapies, and these molecular remissions appear to correlate with a lower likelihood of relapse.
Intensive conventional-dose chemotherapy can achieve high rates of remission, even when monitored by the stringent PCR technique.
Alverine citrate and simeticone combination has been used for almost 20 years in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but supportive scientific evidence of efficacy was limited.
To evaluate the efficacy of alverine citrate and simeticone combination in patients with IBS-related abdominal pain/discomfort.
A total of 412 IBS patients meeting ROME III criteria were included in this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study if their abdominal pain/discomfort intensity was at least 60 mm on a 0-100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) during a 2-week run-in treatment-free period. Patients were randomly assigned through the use of Interactive Voice Response System to receive either alverine citrate 60 mg with simeticone 300 mg three times daily or matching placebo for 4 weeks.
The full analysis set included 409 patients (71.4% female: mean age: 46.2 +/- 13.9 years). At week 4, alverine citrate and simeticone group had lower VAS scores of abdominal pain/discomfort (median: 40 mm vs. 50 mm, P = 0.047) and higher responder rate (46.8% vs. 34.3%, OR = 1.3; P = 0.01) as compared with placebo group. Patient receiving alverine citrate and simeticone reported greater global symptom improvement compared with those receiving placebo (P = 0.0001). Reported adverse events were similar in both groups.
Alverine citrate/simeticone combination was significantly more effective than placebo in relieving abdominal pain/discomfort in patients with IBS.
The hypothesis that cocaine intoxication results in cardiac arrest by producing a block of the propagation of the action potential, without loss of pacemaker function, was tested in rat cardiac tissues. In spontaneously active sinoatrial preparations, cocaine exerted a dose-dependent negative chronotropic action, which was not modified by atropine or propranolol. Sinus node arrest was never observed. Instead, cocaine produced sinoatrial block. The mechanism of this block involved a fall in the resting potential and a decrease in the amplitude and Vmax of phase 0 of the action potential of atrial fibers. In sinoatrial preparations and papillary muscles driven at 5 Hz., cocaine depressed the resting potential, the total amplitude, the overshoot of the action potential, and the Vmax of phase 0. Cocaine had a biphasic effect on the atrial action potential duration. The initial shortening was muscarinic. The prolongation was alpha-adrenergic mediated and probably the result of the inhibition of the transient outward current Ito. In papillary muscles, only the prolongation of the action potential occurred. In conclusion, the electrophysiological actions of cocaine can explain cardiac sudden death. The fall in the resting potential associated with the decrease in the amplitude of the action potential of contractile fibers will result in a block of the propagation of the action potential. Quiescence of the contractile fibers will occur while the sinus node is still generating action potentials at a rate compatible with life.
In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we investigated whether clonidine lessened the requirements for isoflurane, fentanyl, and labetalol to provide controlled hypotension in children who underwent oromaxillofacial surgery. We also studied preoperative sedative effects, the hemodynamic response to nasotracheal intubation, and recovery characteristics. Thirty-nine healthy children, aged 10-16 yr, received clonidine 5 micro g/kg or placebo on the night before surgery and 90 min before surgery. By self-assessment, children in both groups showed similar anxiety, whereas observers rated clonidine patients as more sedated (P < 0.01). Heart rate during induction remained significantly decreased in clonidine patients compared with placebo patients (P < 0.001), as did arterial blood pressure before induction (P < 0.01) and peak pressure after intubation (P < 0.001). Children who took clonidine required significantly less isoflurane to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of 60 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean isoflurane concentration, clonidine 0.99% versus placebo 1.33; P = 0.0004) and required less fentanyl than placebo patients (P = 0.002). Fewer treatment patients received labetalol (clonidine, n = 3 versus placebo, n = 13; P = 0.004). There was a trend toward faster recovery in the clonidine group, with a shortened recovery room stay (P = 0.03). We conclude that clonidine is a useful adjunct for controlled hypotension in children.
This study shows that adolescents having major jaw surgery are helped by the blood pressure-decreasing drug clonidine. This drug allows smaller doses of anesthetics, pain relievers, and blood pressure-decreasing drugs to be used; reduces changes in heart rate and blood pressure; and provides faster recovery from the anesthetic.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder of later life. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene is an important susceptibility locus; however, other environmental and genetic factors operating alone or in combination with ApoE must also be involved. Among candidate genes that may contribute to this residual risk is the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) gene. NO release from vascular endothelium accounts in large part for endothelium-derived relaxing factor bioactivity. Abnormalities of cerebral small vessels occur early in AD, and it has been demonstrated recently that beta-amyloid interacts with endothelial cells in blood vessels to produce an excess of superoxide radicals. We have genotyped 122 cases of early-onset AD (EOAD) and 317 cases of late-onset AD (LOAD) as well as 392 controls for a common structural polymorphism Glu/Asp at codon 298 in the NOS3 gene. We find a highly significant enrichment for Glu/Glu homozygotes in LOAD compared with controls. The effect appears to be independent of ApoE status. NOS3 may be a new genetic risk factor for LOAD.
Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone (FCM) results in a high response rate in previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The aim of this study was to investigate FCM as frontline therapy in CLL.
Sixty-nine patients under the age of 65 years with active CLL were treated. Patients received six cycles of fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) i.v. x 3 days, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m(2) i.v. x 3 days, and mitoxantrone 6 mg/m(2) i.v. x 1 day. Treatment outcome was correlated with clinical and biological variables. The clinical significance of eradicating minimal residual disease (MRD) was also analyzed.
The overall response, MRD-negative complete response (CR), MRD-positive CR, nodular partial response (PR), and PR rates were 90%, 26%, 38%, 14%, and 12%, respectively. Severe (grades 3 or 4) neutropenia developed in 10% of the patients. Major and minor infections were reported in 1% and 8% of cases, respectively. Median response duration was 37 months. Patients with del(17p) failed to attain CR. Patients achieving MRD-negative CR had a longer response duration and overall survival than patients with an inferior response. Low serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, low ZAP-70 expression, and mutated IgV(H) genes predicted longer response duration. Finally, both low ZAP-70 and CD38 expression in leukemic cells correlated with MRD-negativity achievement.
FCM induces a high response rate, including MRD-negative CRs in untreated patients with active CLL. Treatment toxicity is acceptable. Both high ZAP-70 and increased CD38 expression predict failure to obtain MRD-negative response. Patients in whom MRD can be eradicated have longer response duration and overall survival than those with inferior response. These results indicate that FCM can be an ideal companion for chemoimmunotherapy of patients with CLL.
We report 10 cases of glomerulonephritis following methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The clinical features of this syndrome were an abrupt or insidious onset of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with nephrotic syndrome and occasionally purpura, following MRSA infection. The renal histologic findings showed a variety of types of proliferative glomerulonephritis with varying degrees of crescent formation; immunofluorescence revealed of glomerular deposition of IgA, IgG, and C3. Laboratory findings showed polyclonal increases of serum IgA and IgG, with high levels of circulating immune complexes (ICs). Increased numbers of DR+CD4+, and DR+CD8+T cells were observed in the peripheral circulation, with a high frequency of T cell receptor (TCR) V beta + cells. MRSA produced enterotoxins C and A and toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-1, all of which are known to act as superantigens. From the above observations, we speculate that post-MRSA glomerulonephritis may be induced by superantigens causing production of high levels of cytokines, and polyclonal activation of IgG and IgA. The formation of ICs containing IgA and IgG in the circulation result in development of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis. Accordingly, microbial superantigens may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this unique syndrome of nephritis and vasculitis.
This case report describes a patient who demonstrated generalized seizure activity after an injection of 30 mL of levobupivacaine 0.5% for interscalene brachial plexus block. No evidence of cardiovascular toxicity was noted.
Tissue ischaemia-reperfusion evokes toxic and harmful biochemical processes such as oxidative stress and inflammation. The aim of this study is to investigate the indices of tissue damage in rat liver and brain after ischaemia-reperfusion injury of these organs, and to study prospective cytoprotection of molecules such as the novel anti-inflammatory N-(2-thiolethyl)-2-(2-[N'-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino] phenyl)acetamide (compound 1) and alpha-tocopherol. Two experimental models were studied: firstly, 30 min liver ischaemia via hepatoduodenal ligament clamping followed by 60 min reperfusion; and secondly, 45 min cerebral ischaemia via bilateral common carotid artery occlusion followed by 90 min reperfusion. Compound 1 and alpha-tocopherol were administered intraperitoneally before induction of ischaemia. We hereby report that compound 1, a molecule that combines potent in-vitro antioxidant and in-vivo anti-inflammatory activity with low gastrointestinal toxicity, offered protection in-vivo against liver or brain ischaemia-reperfusion-induced damage. Both compound 1 and alpha-tocopherol prevented changes in lipid peroxidation in the rat liver and brain tissue and in tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) levels in brain. Also compound 1 attenuated glutathione depletion, evoked by ischaemia-reperfusion, in the rat brain but not in the liver. These results could be explained on the basis of the antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties of compound 1 and suggest its beneficial effect and potential therapeutic use in post-ischaemic injury.
This study examined the contribution of changes in regulation of intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and multidrug resistance transporter 1 (Mdr1) to absorption of cyclosporine A (CsA) in a rat nephrosis model. Interleukin (IL)-6 was also measured. Puromycin aminonucleoside at a dose of 20 mg/100 g was administered intravenously. Tissue samples were dissected out from the upper and middle intestines and liver after development of nephrosis to measure the expression levels of mRNA and protein. CsA at a dose of 0.5 mg/100 g was administered into a closed loop of the upper and middle intestines. Blood from the inferior vena cava (IVC) and portal vein was taken until 30 min after administration. The expression levels of CYP3A decreased markedly, whereas those of Mdr1 showed large interindividual variations for all of the tissues in the nephrotic rats. Plasma concentrations of CsA reached higher levels in the nephrotic than in the control rats and were higher when administered from the upper than the middle intestine in both the portal vein and IVC. IL-6 increased in urine in the nephrotic rats. In summary, intestinal and hepatic CYP3A were down-regulated in the nephrosis model accompanying the increased levels of IL-6. Consistent results were not obtained for the regulation of Mdr1. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the down-regulation of CYP3A in the upper intestine and liver predominantly contributes to the increase in CsA absorption, and Mdr1 showed less contribution in this rat nephrosis model.
Emerging evidence suggests that the rewarding, abuse-related effects of nicotine are modulated by the endocannabinoid system of the brain. For example, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of cannabinoid CB(1) receptors can reduce or eliminate many abuse-related behavioral and neurochemical effects of nicotine. Furthermore, doses of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and nicotine that are ineffective when given alone can induce conditioned place preference when given together. These previous studies have used systemically administered CB(1) receptor agonists and antagonists and gene deletion techniques, which affect cannabinoid CB(1) receptors throughout the brain. A more functionally selective way to alter endocannabinoid activity is to inhibit fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), thereby magnifying and prolonging the effects of the endocannabinoid anandamide only when and where it is synthesized and released on demand. Here, we combined behavioral and neurochemical approaches to evaluate whether the FAAH inhibitor URB597 (cyclohexyl carbamic acid 3'-carbamoyl-3-yl ester) could alter the abuse-related effects of nicotine in rats. We found that URB597, at a dose (0.3 mg/kg) that had no behavioral effects by itself, prevented development of nicotine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and acquisition of nicotine self-administration. URB597 also reduced nicotine-induced reinstatement in both CPP and self-administration models of relapse. Furthermore, in vivo microdialysis showed that URB597 reduced nicotine-induced dopamine elevations in the nucleus accumbens shell, the terminal area of the brain's mesolimbic reward system. These findings suggest that FAAH inhibition can counteract the addictive properties of nicotine and that FAAH may serve as a new target for development of medications for treatment of tobacco dependence.
Metastatic malignant melanoma (stage IV) is one of the most aggressive tumors. At the moment there is no safe therapy. Therefore the report of Legha et al., who achieved a rate of almost 10% of long-lasting complete remissions with a polychemoimmunotherapy using interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha in combination with cisplatin, vinblastine and dacarbazine, is a promising one. Because of these promising trends, we decided to treat our own patients with this therapy to examine the results, the side effects and the practicability on normal dermatological wards.
From 1997 to 2000 we treated 28 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma with the polychemoimmunotherapy according to Legha's protocol.
We achieved three complete (11.1%) and seven partial (25.9%) remissions (altogether 37%). Two of these patients are living relapse-free at the moment (7.4%). Three patients (11.1%) showed a stabilization of their disease, five patients (18.5%) had a mixed response and nine patients (33.3%) suffered progressive disease.
The rate of complete and partial remissions was lower than those reported by Legha et al., however the rate of long-lasting complete remissions was almost identical. The follow-up time is still ongoing, so we have to limit our results to this period. We want to emphasize the practicability of this kind of therapy on normal dermatological wards in spite of the relatively high toxicity.
The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of nimodipine and mannitol on infarct size and on the amount of apoptosis after transient focal cerebral ischemia. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 300-380 g) by transient occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCAO) using an intraluminal thread model. All animals underwent ischemia for 2 h, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Group I (n=16) was untreated. Group II (n=16) received 15% mannitol (1 g/kg as bolus) and group III (n=9) received 15 microg/kg/h nimodipine intravenously beginning 15 min prior to MCAO. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the brain was taken and sectioned in coronal slices. The slices were stained with H&E and with the transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique. Histopathological analysis revealed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in infarct size in the striatum with both drugs: mannitol (group II) 25.4+/-5.9% and nimodipine (group III) 21.5+/-11.0% versus control (group I) 34.9+/-7.0% and in the cortex 2.7+/-2.0% (group II) and 6.3+/-2.4% (group III) versus control 14.4+/-9.0% (group I). The number of apoptotic cells was statistically lower in the therapy groups (group III 9.6, group II 25.8) versus control (group I 57.9) (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U-test Z>1.96, P<0.05). This study indicates that mannitol and nimodipine provide neuroprotection by preventing both the necrotic and apoptotic components of cell death after transient focal cerebral ischemia and may be effective as neuroprotective drugs for cerebrovascular surgery.
Histological investigations have demonstrated that root canal sealers can induce mild to severe inflammatory alternations. However, there is little information on the precise mechanisms about root canal sealers-induced inflammatory reaction. Dysregulated cytokine productions at local disease sites have been considered to be major contributors to the development of inflammatory diseases. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 released have been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of root canal sealers N2 (zinc-oxide eugenol based) and AH Plus (epoxy resin based) on the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA gene in human osteoblastic cell line U2OS cells. The levels of mRNAs were measured by the semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. The exposure of quiescent U2OS cells to N2 and AH Plus resulted in the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA gene expression (p < 0.05). The intensity of IL-8 mRNA gene was found to be significant higher than IL-6 mRNA gene (p < 0.05). Taken together, the activation of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA gene expression may be one of the pathogenesis of zinc oxide-eugenol based and epoxy resin based root canal sealers-induced periapical inflammation.
Constricting effect of indomethacin on the ductus arteriosus of the fetus is well known. The fetal effects of other nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like naproxen are not well reported. We report here a case of a 3,790-g term neonate who developed persistent pulmonary hypertension after birth with a closed ductus arteriosus. The mother admitted to taking naproxen sodium immediately prior to the birth of the infant. The course of illness was progressively better on conservative management. Like indomethacin, other NSAIDs can also cause premature closure of fetal ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, and life-threatening problems to the neonate. Patient education regarding over-the-counter pain medication during pregnancy should be emphasized.
Inorganic arsenic is metabolized to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Limited evidence suggests that the ability to fully metabolize arsenic into DMA influences susceptibility to disease. To determine whether percentage of MMA was predictive of disease, the authors used data from a case-control study conducted in Bangladesh (2001-2003). Persons who were diagnosed with keratosis, melanosis, Bowen's disease, or squamous cell carcinoma were matched on age, sex, and village to persons without these conditions. This analysis was restricted to persons who had no missing data on covariates (859 cases, 868 controls). A path analysis was used to evaluate simultaneously the association between the percentage of all urinary arsenic metabolites and the odds of skin lesions using PROC CALIS in SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and Mplus, version 6.1 (Muthén & Muthén, Los Angeles, California). The odds of skin lesions were significantly associated with log(10) percentage of MMA (adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) = 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15, 2.12) but not log(10) percentage of inorganic arsenic (OR(adj) = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.75, 1.50) or log(10) percentage of DMA (OR(adj) = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.33, 3.46). This novel analysis confirmed that persons who excrete a higher proportion of MMA have a greater risk of skin lesions after data are adequately controlled for urinary arsenic metabolites, current arsenic exposure, and other risk factors.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the autoinflammatory disease and hereditary periodic fever syndrome that most commonly affects people of Eastern Mediterranean origin. It is characterized by recurrent self-limited attacks of fever and serositis, with an increase in acute-phase reactant markers, and is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. Inflammation shifts the hemostatic mechanisms favoring thrombosis. There are few reports of an increased risk of hypercoagulability in patients with FMF in the absence of amyloidosis and nephrotic syndrome. In this case report, we describe a 43-year-old Turkish patient who presented with right-sided pleuritic chest pain and pulmonary embolism. The patient described having prior similar attacks of serositis, but had never been diagnosed with FMF. Further workup revealed an increase in acute phase reactants, negative hypercoagulability studies and heterozygosity for the M694V mutation in the pyrin (MEFV) gene. We identified untreated FMF and chronic inflammation as his only risk factor for pulmonary embolism. With this case report, we support recent studies that have demonstrated that inflammation may lead to prothrombotic states in patients with FMF.
Clinical, ultrasound and ECG studies of the left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) carried out in 25 patients with extensive breast cancer in the course of 148 cycles of standard CAF combination therapy established a protective effect of cardioxane (ICRF-187, dexrazoxane) treatment against the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin, administered in the maximal cumulative dose of 850 mg/sq. m (decrease in LVEF over 20% as compared with basal level, without clinical symptoms of cardiomyopathy or ECG-revealed disturbances in 0.6% of cycles). 1000 mg/sq.m cardioxane, administered in conjunction with doxorubicin in the ratio of 20:1, neither inhibited the antitumor activity of chemotherapy nor contributed to untoward side-effects which are not associated with cardiotoxicity.
Dysfunction in immune surveillance during anticancer chemotherapy of patients often causes weakness of the host defense system and a subsequent increase in microbial infections. However, the deterioration of organ-specific function related to microbial challenges in cisplatin-treated patients has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated cisplatin-induced TLR4 expression and its binding to LPS in mouse cochlear tissues and the effect of this interaction on hearing function. Cisplatin increased the transcriptional and translational expression of TLR4 in the cochlear tissues, organ of Corti explants, and HEI-OC1 cells. Furthermore, cisplatin increased the interaction between TLR4 and its microbial ligand LPS, thereby upregulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, via NF-κB activation. In C57BL/6 mice, the combined injection of cisplatin and LPS caused severe hearing impairment compared with that in the control, cisplatin-alone, or LPS-alone groups, whereas this hearing dysfunction was completely suppressed in both TLR4 mutant and knockout mice. These results suggest that hearing function can be easily damaged by increased TLR expression and microbial infections due to the weakened host defense systems of cancer patients receiving therapy comprising three to six cycles of cisplatin alone or cisplatin combined with other chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, such damage can occur even though patients may not experience ototoxic levels of cumulative cisplatin concentration.
To identify epigenetically silenced cancer-related genes and to determine molecular effects of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza-dC) and/or trichostatin A (TSA) in multiple myeloma (MM), we analyzed global changes in gene expression profiles of three MM cell lines by microarray analysis. We identified up-regulation of several genes whose epigenetic silencing in MM is well known. However, much more importantly, we identified a large number of epigenetically inactivated cancer-related genes that are involved in various physiologic processes and whose epigenetic regulation in MM was unknown thus far. In addition, drug treatment of MM cell lines resulted in down-regulation of several MM proliferation-associated factors (i.e., MAF, CCND1/2, MYC, FGFR3, MMSET). Ten Aza-dC and/or TSA up-regulated genes (CPEB1, CD9, GJA1, BCL7c, GADD45G, AKAP12, TFPI2, CCNA1, SPARC, and BNIP3) were selected for methylation analysis in six MM cell lines, 24 samples from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and 111 samples from patients with MM. Methylation frequencies of these genes ranged between 0% and 17% in MGUS samples and between 5% and 50% in MM samples. Interestingly, methylation of SPARC and BNIP3 was statistically significantly associated with a poor overall survival of MM patients (P = 0.003 and P = 0.017, respectively). Moreover, SPARC methylation was associated with loss of SPARC protein expression by immunostaining in a subset of MM patients. In conclusion, we identified new targets for aberrant methylation in monoclonal gammopathies, and our results suggest that DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibition might play an important role in the future treatment of patients with MM.
The photodegradation products of the anticancer drug, dacarbazine, cause adverse reactions including local venous pain when injected intravenously. In this study, we attempted to identify which of these products is responsible. We synthesized or purchased five photodegradation products of dacarbazine (dimethylamine, 5-diazoimidazole-4-carboxamide (Diazo-IC), 4-carbamoylimidazolium-5-olate, 5-carbamoyl-2-(4-carbamoylimidazol-5-ylazo)imidazolium-5-olate and 2-azahypoxanthine) and examined the pain reaction induced by their intraperitoneal administration in mice using an abdominal stretching or constriction assay. Only Diazo-IC clearly induced pain reaction in mice in a dose-dependent manner, the other products caused no pain reaction. The threshold concentration for pain reaction in mice was estimated to be about 0.1 mg mL-1. While diclofenac sodium significantly reduced acetic-acid-induced pain reaction in mice, it did not influence those induced by Diazo-IC. This result suggests that the mechanism of Diazo-IC-induced pain is different from that of acetic-acid-induced inflammatory pain. Dacarbazine itself produced marked relaxation of rat thoracic aorta strips in a concentration-dependent manner, but there was no difference between the activity of dacarbazine and its photo-exposed solution, so constriction or relaxation of blood vessels is unlikely to be a factor in the pain reaction. In conclusion, Diazo-IC generated by photodegradation of dacarbazine solution causes the side-effect of venous pain. Dacarbazine solution that has turned pink should not be used, because Diazo-IC is an intermediate in the formation of the reddish product, 5-carbamoyl-2-(4-carbamoylimidazol-5-ylazo)imidazolium-5-olate. Drip infusion preparations of dacarbazine should be shielded from light.
Thioacetamide (TA) is a commonly used drug that can trigger acute hepatic failure (AHF) through generation of oxidative stress. Vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1 (VDUP1) is an endogenous inhibitor of thioredoxin, a ubiquitous thiol oxidoreductase, that regulates cellular redox status. In this study, we investigated the role of VDUP1 in AHF using a TA-induced liver injury model. VDUP1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to a single intraperitoneal TA injection, and various parameters of hepatic injury were assessed. VDUP1 KO mice displayed a significantly higher survival rate, lower serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and less hepatic damage, compared to WT mice. In addition, induction of apoptosis was decreased in VDUP1 KO mice, with the alteration of caspase-3 and -9 activities, Bax-to-Bcl-2 expression ratios, and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Importantly, analysis of TA bioactivation revealed lower plasma clearance of TA and covalent binding of [¹⁴C]TA to liver macromolecules in VDUP1 KO mice. Furthermore, the level of oxidative stress was significantly less in VDUP1 KO mice than in their WT counterparts, as evident from lipid peroxidation assay. These results collectively indicate that VDUP1 deficiency protects against TA-induced acute liver injury via lower bioactivation of TA and antioxidant effects.
Our study explored the influence of diet on gliomagenesis and associated systemic effects (SE) in rats. The experimental diet contained various ingredients supposed to interfere with carcinogenesis, mainly phytochemicals (PtcD for phytochemical diet) and its effects were compared to those of the same diet without the phytochemicals (BD for basal diet). Glioma was induced by ethylnitrosourea to pregnant females fed the diets from the start of gestation until the moment of sacrifice of the offpsrings. In male rats fed the PtcD or the BD the incidence of gliomas was markedly reduced compared to rats fed a standard diet (StD). In females this effect was weaker and was limited to the PtcD. A significant proportion of rats with brain tumors and fed the StD exhibited SE evidenced by weight loss, a shorter survival, reduction in liver weight and an increased proportion of liver mitochondria, effects that were not observed in their counterpart fed PtcD. Comparison of the expression of genes involved in the balance proliferation/apoptosis and in the response to oxidative stress in male brain tumors showed that the prevention of SE was associated with an increase in bcl-2 and catalase and a decrease in ki-67, sod-1 and sod-2 transcripts. These results show that the degree of agressiveness of gliomas can be modulated by dietary interventions and suggest that some phytochemicals with antioxidant properties could participate to the mechanism.
