A review of the Food and Drug Administration's spontaneous reporting system identified 48 reports of adverse events in patients who received concomitant therapy with ciprofloxacin (n = 39) or norfloxacin (n = 9) and theophylline. The mean (SD) age of these cases was 68.4 (18.5) years; 25 patients (52%) were female. The mean percent change in theophylline concentrations was 114%, with a range of 32% to 308% following the addition of a quinolone to the patient's theophylline regimen. Fourteen (36%) of the 39 patients receiving ciprofloxacin and three (33%) of the nine patients receiving norfloxacin experienced a seizure. The accumulated evidence suggests that extreme caution should be used when quinolones are prescribed in conjunction with theophylline, particularly in elderly patients. Further research is required to identify risk factors that will more specifically predict the magnitude of the interaction.
The effects of chronic administration of cocaine to pregnant rabbits on maternal seizures and on pregnancy outcome were studied. Cocaine (2, 3 or 4 mg/kg/injection) or saline was administered, I.V., twice daily, from gestation Day 8 (G8) to G29. There were no significant differences in maternal weight gain or pregnancy outcome between saline control animals and animals given a cocaine dose of 2, 3 or 4 mg/kg/injection. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) were occasionally elicited by the highest dose (4 mg/kg). There were significant individual differences in vulnerability to cocaine-elicited GTCSs in animals given 4 mg/kg/injection. Of this group, 18% were classified as having high vulnerability to seizures, and they experienced a range from 3 to 27 GTCSs. Postnatal mortality of their offspring was significantly increased. The incidence and temporal patterns of GTCSs elicited by chronic, I.V. cocaine in rabbits, at the doses used, are similar to those reported in human cocaine use. These GTCSs may involve different mechanisms from seizures elicited in other animal studies, in which high doses of cocaine are administered I.P. or S.C. Nevertheless, in our animal model, the GTCSs elicited by prenatal cocaine exposure had no detectable effects on pregnancy outcome (except in the highly vulnerable subgroup).
Hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex multifactorial process in which continuous intrahepatic inflammation plays a major role. Although inflammatory cell infiltration is observed in the process of chemical-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, the pathophysiological role of the inflammatory response is not well defined. To approach this question, molecular and cellular responses were monitored during the development of liver tumors in mice exposed to a chemical hepatocarcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), in drinking water (50 microg/l). Intrahepatic type I and type II interferon (IFN-beta and IFN-gamma, respectively) mRNA expression was found to be induced 2 months before the appearance of hepatocellular carcinomas. The pathogenetic importance of IFNs was determined by monitoring tumor development in mice genetically deficient in the IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFN-alpha/betaR KO) or the IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR KO). IFN-gammaR KO mice developed fewer tumors than IFN-alpha/betaR KO and wild-type (wt) mice, although the tumor diameters did not differ significantly among the three lineages. Interestingly, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the percentage of monocytes/macrophages in infiltrating mononuclear cells was reduced greatly in the livers of IFN-gammaR KO mice, which is consistent with the facts that intrahepatic cytokine expression was diminished and oxidative DNA damage was induced to a lesser extent. In conclusion, type II IFN, but not type I IFNs, may be involved critically in the initiation stage, but not the promotion stage, of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis by enhancing monocytes/macrophages activation and eventual hepatocyte DNA damage.
The effect of the polyamine spermine previously shown to suppress erythropoiesis in vitro was investigated in a long term animal experiment. Continuous application of spermine by intraperitoneally implanted microperfusion pumps caused a mild hypoproliferative microcytic anemia in normal rats. Furthermore, in 12 patients with advanced renal insufficiency spermine was shown to be markedly elevated. This, together with the results obtained in animal experiments, suggests that hypersperminemia is the reason for the impaired erythropoiesis in anemic uremic patients.
Some empirical evidence suggests that the endocannabinoids (eCB) (e.g. anandamide) may play an important role in cocaine addiction. The eCB act as a retrograde messengers activating CB receptors at the presynaptic membrane and are degraded by enzymatic actions of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The present study aimed to examine the effect of the FAAH inhibitors, phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF; i.p.) or cyclohexylcarbamic acid 3-carbamoyl biphenyl-3-yl ester (URB597; i.p.) on the cocaine- or food-maintained self-administration as well as on the cocaine-seeking or food-taking behaviors in rats. Male Wistar rats were implanted with a catheter (iv.) and trained to self-administer cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion) on a fixed ratio 5 schedule of reinforcement with a conditioned stimulus (tone+light). After self-administration stabilized, extinction/reinstatement procedures were carried out during which the rats were tested for the response reinstatement induced by cocaine (10 mg/kg, ip) or a cue (light+tone). The food (sweetened milk) self-administration and extinction/reinstatement procedures were conducted in a manner resembling cocaine self-administration. Neither PMSF (30-120 mg/kg) nor URB597 (0.1-3 mg/kg) affected cocaine self-administration. PMSF, 60 mg/kg, significantly reduced cocaine-induced reinstatement and at 120 mg/kg (combined with the challenge dose of cocaine) it evoked behavioral disruption. PMSF (60-120 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited cue-induced reinstatement. URB597 (1-3 mg/kg) attenuated both cocaine- and cue-induced drug-seeking behaviors. PMSF (60 mg/kg) decreased food self-administration. Toward reinstatement of food-taking behavior PMSF (60-120 mg/kg) and URB597 (3 mg/kg) showed inhibitory effects. Our results indicate that FAAH inhibitors could be potent modulators of motivational and conditioned aspects of goal-directed behaviors with less prominent effects on consumatory behaviors.
Hepatic and renal subacute toxicity induced by the antineoplastic drugs chlorambucil, cisplatin, epirubicin and methotrexate and the steroid alkylating agent 3 beta-hydroxy-13 alpha-amino-13,17-seco-5 alpha-androstan-17-oic-13, 17-lactam (p-[bis(2-chloroethyl) amino] phenyl) acetate was investigated in rats using serum biochemical parameters. Toxicological evaluation was performed in serum samples following the administration of dose regimens of the agents that were previously shown to be effective in suppressing malignant tumor growth or to prolong survival in tumor bearing animals. Hepatic and renal subacute toxicity was evaluated by measuring enzyme activity or concentrations of: alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, gamma-glutamyltransferase, glucose, potassium, sodium, blood urea nitrogen and uric acid. The use of the above serum biochemical parameters indicated that the overall toxicity impact of the antitumor drugs was methotrexate < cisplatin < epirubicin < chlorambucil. The homo-azasteroid ester only transiently affected the biochemical parameters associated with renal toxicity, while it affected some of the biochemical parameters associated with hepatic toxicity, though to a significantly lower extent than the antitumor drugs.
Under the conditions of the constancy of the postsynaptic effect of two M-cholinolytics atropine and amizil the relationship between the presynaptic and protective effects of the drugs in DDVF intoxication was studied. The indication of the level of the postsynaptic activity was the suppression by the cholinolytics of tremor reaction in rats induced by the action of arecoline. The presynaptic effect of the drugs was judged by the charge of the "bound" acetylcholine content in the brains of the animals. It was found that when administered in the equieffective by the choline-blocking activity doses, atropine to a greater extent reduced the content of the "bound" acetylcholine which was increased due to the action of DDVF and at the same time it possessed the less pronounced protective activity in intoxication with DDVF than amizil. It is supposed that the removal of the presynaptic suppression of acetylcholine release due to the anticholinesterase substance action deteriorates the prognosis of the course of DDVF intoxication.
Absence of decay-accelerating factor 1 (Daf1) has been shown to enhance T-cell responses and autoimmunity via increased expression of specific cytokines, most notably interferon (IFN)-gamma. To determine if Daf1 deficiency can exacerbate IFN-gamma-dependent murine mercury-induced autoimmunity (mHgIA), C57/BL6 Daf1(+/+) and Daf1(-/-) mice were exposed to mercuric chloride (HgCl(2)) and examined for differences in cytokine expression, T-cell activation and features of humoral autoimmunity. In the absence of Daf1, mHgIA was exacerbated, with increased serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) and anti-chromatin autoantibodies. This aggravated response could not be explained by increased T-cell activation but was associated with increased levels of IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-10 but not IL-17 in Daf1-deficient mice. Anti-CD3/anti-CD28 costimulation of Daf1(-/-) CD4(+) T cells in vitro was also found to increase cytokine expression, but the profile was different from that of mHgIA, suggesting that the cytokine changes observed in Daf1 deficiency reflect a response to mercury. The role of Daf1 in influencing cytokine expression was further examined by stimulation of CD4(+) T cells in the presence of anti-CD3 and CD97, a molecular partner for Daf1. This resulted in increased IL-10, decreased IL-17 and IL-21 and decreased IFN-gamma. These findings demonstrate that the absence of Daf1 exacerbates mHgIA, with changes in the profile of expressed cytokines. Interaction between Daf1 and its molecular partner CD97 was found to modify expression of mHgIA-promoting cytokines, suggesting a possible approach for the suppression of overaggressive cytokine production in autoimmunity.
The major drug-metabolizing enzymes for the oxidation of oxycodone are CYP2D6 and CYP3A. A high interindividual variability in the activity of these enzymes because of genetic polymorphisms and/or drug-drug interactions is well established. The possible role of an active metabolite in the pharmacodynamics of oxycodone has been questioned and the importance of CYP3A-mediated effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxycodone has been poorly explored.
We conducted a randomized crossover (five arms) double-blind placebo-controlled study in 10 healthy volunteers genotyped for CYP2D6. Oral oxycodone (0.2 mg x kg(-1)) was given alone or after inhibition of CYP2D6 (with quinidine) and/or of CYP3A (with ketoconazole). Experimental pain (cold pressor test, electrical stimulation, thermode), pupil size, psychomotor effects and toxicity were assessed.
CYP2D6 activity was correlated with oxycodone experimental pain assessment. CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers experienced increased pharmacodynamic effects, whereas cold pressor test and pupil size were unchanged in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, relative to extensive metabolizers. CYP2D6 blockade reduced subjective pain threshold (SPT) for oxycodone by 30% and the response was similar to placebo. CYP3A4 blockade had a major effect on all pharmacodynamic assessments and SPT increased by 15%. Oxymorphone C(max) was correlated with SPT assessment (rho(S)= 0.7) and the only independent positive predictor of SPT. Side-effects were observed after CYP3A4 blockade and/or in CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers.
The modulation of CYP2D6 and CYP3A activities had clear effects on oxycodone pharmacodynamics and these effects were dependent on CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism.
The influence of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on cocaine-and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was examined in mice. All adenosine receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice, and the effects were dose-dependent. It seems that adenosine A1 and A2 receptors might be involved in this reaction. Moreover, all adenosine receptor agonists: 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS 21680), A2A receptor agonist, N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), A1 receptor agonist, and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), A2/A1 receptor agonist significantly and dose-dependently decreased cocaine-induced locomotor activity. CPA reduced cocaine action at the doses which, given alone, did not influence motility, while CGS 21680 and NECA decreased the action of cocaine at the doses which, given alone, decreased locomotor activity in animals. These results suggest the involvement of both adenosine receptors in the action of cocaine although agonists of A1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it. The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptor by DMPX (3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine) significantly enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity of animals. Caffeine had similar action but the effect was not significant. CPT (8-cyclopentyltheophylline)--A1 receptor antagonist, did not show any influence in this test. Similarly, all adenosine receptor agonists decreased amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, but at the higher doses than those which were active in cocaine-induced hyperactivity. The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptors (DMPX) and non-selective blockade of adenosine receptors (caffeine) significantly increased the action of amphetamine in the locomotor activity test. Our results have shown that all adenosine receptor agonists (A1 and A2) reduce cocaine- and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and indicate that cocaine-induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists (particularly A1 receptors) than amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.
Scleroderma renal crisis is a clinical syndrome of systemic sclerosis that is classically characterized by accelerated hypertension, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hyperreninemia. It has been reported that cocaine may initiate scleroderma in an already susceptible individual or unmask it at an earlier age in subclinical disease. We describe a 46-year-old male patient with a history of heavy cocaine abuse that unmasked scleroderma and precipitated scleroderma renal crisis.
Bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of D-alanine (200-600 micrograms/rat) antagonized the ability of methamphetamine (1.0 mg/kg s.c.) to induce locomotor stimulation in the rat. In contrast, L-alanine (600 micrograms/rat) failed to affect the behavioral change induced by methamphetamine. The stereoselectivity parallels the potency of these amino acids as agonists for the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding site within the NMDA receptor complex. These results support the view that reduced excitatory amino acidergic neurotransmission may be involved in methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity.
Osteoclasts are responsible for bone erosion in diseases as diverse as osteoporosis, periodontitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Natural plant-derived products have received recent attention as potential therapeutic and preventative drugs in human disease. The effect of rotenone in RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation was examined in this study. Rotenone inhibited RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) in a dose-dependent manner without any evidence of cytotoxicity. The mRNA expression of c-Fos, NFATc1, TRAP, and OSCAR in RANKL-treated BMMs was inhibited by rotenone treatment. Rotenone strongly inhibited p38 and ERK phosphorylation and I-kappaB degradation in RANKL-stimulated BMMs, and did not inhibit JNK phosphorylation. Further, RANKL-induced c-Fos and NFATc1 protein expression was suppressed by rotenone. Rotenone additionally inhibited the bone resorptive activity of differentiated osteoclasts. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone erosion study was also performed to assess the effects of rotenone in vivo. Mice treated with rotenone demonstrated marked attenuation of bone erosion based on Micro CT and histologic analysis of femurs. These results collectively suggested that rotenone demonstrated inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation in vitro and suppressed inflammatory bone loss in vivo. Rotenone may therefore serve as a useful drug in the prevention of bone loss.
The tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha in patients suffering from acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Treatment of APL patients with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) reverses the disease phenotype by a process involving the degradation of the fusion protein via its PML moiety. Several PML isoforms are generated from a single PML gene by alternative splicing. They share the same N-terminal region containing the RBCC/tripartite motif but differ in their C-terminal sequences. Recent studies of all the PML isoforms reveal the specific functions of each. Here, we review the nomenclature and structural organization of the PML isoforms in order to clarify the various designations and classifications found in different databases. The functions of the PML isoforms and their differential roles in antiviral defense also are reviewed. Finally, the key players involved in the degradation of the PML isoforms in response to As2O3 or other inducers are discussed.
A retrospective study on 25 women (8 with endometrial carcinoma, 17 with severe endometrial atypical hyperplasia) under 35 years treated with progestin showed that six cases (75%) in the endometrial carcinoma (EC) group and 17 (100%) in the atypical hyperplasia (AH) group responded to the treatment, and among the 14 complete responders, 4 (40%) patients with AH had 7 pregnancies and 3 healthy deliveries. Given accurate pretreatment assessment, progestin therapy is a feasible management option to preserve fertility for young women with well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma or severe atypical hyperplasia of endometrium.
Intestinal ischaemia is an uncommon complication of recreational cocaine abuse. We report the case of a 36-year-old male who underwent emergency surgery for acute abdomen. At laparotomy, the transverse colon appeared markedly oedematous, dilated and with subserosal haemorrhage. Segmental resection was performed and microscopic examination of the resected specimen showed focal necrosis of the mucosa with a patchy polymorphonuclear and mononuclear infiltrate. The submucosa was markedly thickened due to oedema; focal haemorrhage was observed and blood vessels were dilated but showed no structural abnormalities or thrombosis. These findings were consistent with ischaemic colitis. No risk factors for intestinal ischaemia were present but the patient stated that he had injected cocaine i.v. the day before the onset of symptoms. He was not a cocaine abuser but occasionally sniffed, smoked or injected cocaine. Cocaine use should be considered in the aetiological diagnosis of intestinal ischaemia in young patients.
Warfarin increases mortality of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The authors investigated whether this effect reflects increased baseline ICH volume at presentation or increased ICH expansion.
Subjects were drawn from an ongoing prospective cohort study of ICH outcome. The effect of warfarin on baseline ICH volume was studied in 183 consecutive cases of supratentorial ICH age > or = 18 years admitted to the emergency department over a 5-year period. Baseline ICH volume was determined using computerized volumetric analysis. The effect of warfarin on ICH expansion (increase in volume > or = 33% of baseline) was analyzed in 70 consecutive cases in whom ICH volumes were measured on all subsequent CT scans up to 7 days after admission. Multivariable analysis was used to determine warfarin's influence on baseline ICH, ICH expansion, and whether warfarin's effect on ICH mortality was dependent on baseline volume or subsequent expansion.
There was no effect of warfarin on initial volume. Predictors of larger baseline volume were hyperglycemia (p < 0.0001) and lobar hemorrhage (p < 0.0001). Warfarin patients were at increased risk of death, even when controlling for ICH volume at presentation. Warfarin was the sole predictor of expansion (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.7 to 22.9) and expansion in warfarin patients was detected later in the hospital course compared with non-warfarin patients (p < 0.001). ICH expansion showed a trend toward increased mortality (OR 3.5, 95% CI 0.7 to 8.9, p = 0.14) and reduced the marginal effect of warfarin on ICH mortality.
Warfarin did not increase ICH volume at presentation but did raise the risk of in-hospital hematoma expansion. This expansion appears to mediate part of warfarin's effect on ICH mortality.
Lung cancer is a common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Aberrant activation of WNT signaling is implicated in lung carcinogenesis. EMX2, a human homologue of the Drosophila empty spiracles gene is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor. The function of EMX2 has been linked to the WNT signaling pathway during embryonic patterning in mice. However, little is known about the role of EMX2 in human tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that EMX2 was dramatically downregulated in lung cancer tissue samples and this downregulation was associated with methylation of the EMX2 promoter. Restoration of EMX2 expression in lung cancer cells lacking endogenous EMX2 expression suppressed cell proliferation and invasive phenotypes, inhibited canonical WNT signaling, and sensitized lung cancer cells to the treatment of the chemo cytotoxic drug cisplatin. On the other hand, knockdown of EMX2 expression in lung cancer cells expressing endogenous EMX2 promoted cell proliferation, invasive phenotypes and canonical WNT signaling. Taken together, our study suggests that EMX2 may have important roles as a novel suppressor in human lung cancer.
Tumorigenic effect of a diet containing quinoline on the liver of various animals and the synergistic or antagonistic effect by other chemicals on quinoline hepatocarcinogenesis in rats were examined. It was concluded that 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane (0.1%) and 3-methylcholanthrene (0.0067%) had a significant inhibitory effect on liver carcinogenesis due to quinoline in rats, but 1-naphthyl isothiocyanate (0.06%) and p-hydroxypropiophenone (1.0%) had no inhibitory effect in the present observations. Transmission electron-microscopic study demonstrated the fine structure of vascular tumors induced by quinoline. On the other hand, it was found that quinoline induced liver tumors in both sexes of mice and rats but not in hamsters or guinea pigs. Male rats were more susceptible than females to the tumorigenic action of quinoline, and mice showed the least susceptibility. Histological changes in the liver of rats or mice induced by quinoline were clasified as hemangioendotheliomas or hemangiosarcomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. Several rats treated with quinoline had hemangiosarcomatous metastatic foci in the lung.
Variations of Ki-67, p53, and Adnab-9 monoclonal antibody reactions in colonic adenomas may be associated with colonic cancer risk. We studied the predictive value of these markers for adverse behavior in severely dysplastic colorectal adenomas, such as an associated carcinoma, multiplicity of adenomas, and subsequent development of adenomas. For this purpose we compared theclinical, gross, and histologic characteristics of highly dysplastic index polyps in 42 patients with Ki 67, p53, and Adnab-9 immunostaining and other molecular markers. Polyps were removed endoscopically, and severely dysplastic polyps were stained immunohistochemically with Ki-67, Adnab-9, and p53 protein by the avidin biotin conjugate (ABC) technique. Quantitative DNA (QDNA) was analyzed by computer-assisted image analysis. Ki-67 immunohistochemistry showed reversal of normal distribution of nuclear staining from the normal basal position to the upper third of the colonic crypts. This abnormality of immunostaining in dysplastic adenomas was the earliest detected by the panel we used. A statistically significant correlation was seen between invasiveness of carcinoma in the index polyp and polyp size (P = 0.003), sessile morphology (P = 0.037), and villous or tubulovillous histology (P = 0.019). In the index adenoma, p53 positivity was correlated with multiplicity at initial examination (P = 0.053), villous histology (P = 0.053), invasiveness of carcinoma (P < 0.003), and recurrence of colorectal adenomas (P = 0.025). Although p53 positivity and aneuploidy were correlated with invasiveness of carcinoma in the index polyp (P = 0.025), Adnab-9 positivity was not. However, Adnab-9 positivity in the index polyp was associated with multiplicity of adenomas (P = 0.04) as well as recurrence of adenomas (P < 0.024). In conclusion, in addition to the morphologic and histologic markers already known, Ki-67, Adnab-9 antibody, and p53 protein may be prognostic indicators useful in follow-up of patients with severely dysplastic colorectal adenomas. Adnab-9 antibody may identify a field defect in above-average-risk adenoma-bearing patients.
We previously showed that amiodarone, an iodine-rich benzofuranic derivative, interferes with the progression of myocarditis using a rat model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis. Further studies have also revealed that intraperitoneal treatment with 12.5 mg/kg amiodarone, which is below the range of its therapeutic plasma concentration, also effectively interferes with the progression of myocarditis using the same model. The relationship between myocarditis and the thymus has not been studied in either patients or animal models. To investigate whether the thymus is involved in the effect of amiodarone on experimental autoimmune myocarditis, we examined its phenotypic distribution in thymocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes using flow cytometry. We found no significant differences in the proportions of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and the CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio in the control group compared with amiodarone-treated group. However, amiodarone-treated group induced a decrease in the proportion of CD4(+)TNF(+) and CD4(+)IL-4(+) T cells and an increase in CD4(+)IFN(+) T cells, resulting in a significant reduction of the CD4(+)TNF(+)/CD4(+)IFN(+) and CD4(+)IL-4(+)/CD4(+)IFN(+) T cell ratios. These results suggest for the first time that the thymus is actively involved when myocarditis is treated with amiodarone.
The cardiovascular properties of MS-857 [4-acetyl-1-methyl-7-(4-pyridyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3(2H)-isoquinolinone ], a novel cardiotonic agent, were investigated in anesthetized and conscious dogs. MS-857 (1-100 micrograms/kg i.v.) produced a significant and dose-dependent increase in cardiac contractility with relatively small changes in heart rate and blood pressure. This indicates a sizable separation between positive inotropic and other effects of MS-857. Oral administration of MS-857 to conscious dogs (0.1-1 mg/kg) also produced a sustained increase in cardiac contractility in a dose-dependent manner. The total duration of action was longer than 7 h at a dose of 1 mg/kg p.o. There occurred no arrhythmias and no changes in animal behavior. After chronic oral administration, MS-857 completely retained its activities, indicating the lack of tachyphylaxis. In the acute heart failure models induced by either propranolol or pentobarbital, MS-857 reversed the cardiac depressant effects of these drugs. Moreover, MS-857 also significantly improved the pentobarbital-induced heart failure in the heart-lung preparation. MS-857 did not inhibit the Na+, K+-ATPase, but inhibited the phosphodiesterase (PDE) III selectively, both of which were prepared from the dog ventricular muscle. Thus, MS-857 can be characterized as a potent nonsympathomimetic, nonglycoside cardiotonic drug with a selective inhibitory activity on PDE III. The cardiovascular properties revealed by this study strongly suggest that MS-857 will exert a beneficial effect in the treatment of congestive heart failure.
The present study investigated the interaction between highly reactive gaseous-free radical NO and cytokines that are produced by activated Th-1 cells on the cerebral immune response and neuronal integrity. CD-1 mice received an intrastriatal infusion of different solutions containing the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester, NO-releasing substance sodium nitroprusside (SNP), IFN-gamma, and/or TNF-alpha. The solution containing both cytokines caused a profound and transient transcriptional activation of numerous genes encoding proinflammatory proteins in microglial/monocytic cells ipsilateral to infusion site. This increase in gene expression peaked 1 day after the cerebral bolus of cytokines and returned to basal levels from 3 to 7 days post administration. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester further stimulated this immune reaction to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but the brain of these mice failed to exhibit signs of neurodegeneration and demyelination. In contrast, a single bolus of SNP in the striatal region caused neuronal death and demyelination as early as 1 to 3 days following the infusion with the NO donor. This phenomenon was greatly exacerbated by the coadministration of both cytokines, although TNF-alpha remained the most critical cytokine to enhance the damage of cerebral elements. These data provide evidence that NO has the ability to modulate the immune response, which is not by itself detrimental for the brain. However, SNP-induced NO production together with TNF-alpha in the cerebral environment are critical events leading to intense neurodegeneration and demyelination in vivo.
We sought to evaluate 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) for prevention of preterm birth (PTB) in women with prior spontaneous PTB (SPTB) and cervical length (CL) <25 mm.
We conducted planned secondary analysis of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-sponsored randomized trial evaluating cerclage for women with singleton gestations, prior SPTB (17-33 6/7 weeks), and CL <25 mm between 16-22 6/7 weeks. Women were stratified at randomization to intent to use or not use 17P. The effect of 17P was analyzed separately for cerclage and no-cerclage groups. Primary outcome was PTB <35 weeks.
In 300 women, 17P had no effect on PTB <35 weeks in either cerclage (P = .64) or no-cerclage (P = .51) groups. Only PTB <24 weeks (odds ratio, 0.08) and perinatal death (odds ratio, 0.14) were significantly lower for those with 17P in the no-cerclage group.
17P had no additional benefit for prevention of PTB in women who had prior SPTB and got ultrasound-indicated cerclage for CL <25 mm. In women who did not get cerclage, 17P reduced previable birth and perinatal mortality.
Hypotension was induced in sixteen patients with nitroprusside during anesthesia for surgical correction of cerebral aneurysms. Eight patients were premedicated with propranolol (180 mg orally) for one day and the other eight were not. Before the start of anesthesia, the untreated patients had a mean arterial pressure of 102 +/- 3 mm Hg, a heart rate of 76 +/- 2 beats/min, and plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations of 114 +/- 21 and 258 +/- 34 pg/ml, respectively. The propranolol-premedicated patients came to the operating room in a significantly different clinical state with a mean arterial pressure of 92 +/- 3 mm Hg, a heart rate of 71 +/- 2 beats/min, and plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations of 76 +/- 28 and 144 +/- 28 pg/ml. During induced hypotension, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations increased significantly in both groups (454 +/- 42 and 730 +/- 58 pg/ml in the untreated patients, 160 +/- 48 and 419 +/- 67 pg/ml in the propranolol premedicated patients), but the increase in catecholamines was significantly greater in the untreated patients. Thirty minutes after nitroprusside was discontinued, epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were higher than in the awake state in untreated patients and were associated with rebound hypertension and tachycardia. In contrast, in propranolol-premedicated patients, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations decreased towards the preanesthesia values, mean arterial pressure gradually returned to the prehypotension level, and heart rate remained unchanged. This study thus demonstrates that propranolol premedication attenuates the release of catecholamines in response to nitroprusside-induced hypotension.
We report a case of a 35-year-old previously healthy man treated with clomiphene for infertility, who presented with blurred vision in his left eye due to ocular vein occlusion as documented by fluorescein angiography. The patient was heterozygous for the factor V Leiden (FV Leiden) mutation and for the 1298 A-C polymorphism of the methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. He was treated with clopidogrel and is now free of symptoms. Because congenital thrombophilia is a moderate risk factor for central retinal vein occlusion and the administration of clomiphene may trigger this process, we recommend screening of young patients for FV Leiden before clomiphene treatment.
Age is a known susceptibility factor for the cardiotoxicity of several anticancer drugs, including mitoxantrone (MTX). The impact of anticancer drugs in young patients is underestimated, thus we aimed to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of MTX in juvenile and adult animals. Juvenile (3 week-old) and adult (8-10 week-old) male CD-1 mice were used. Each group was treated with a 9.0mg/kg cumulative dose of MTX or saline; they were maintained in a drug-free period for 3-weeks after the last administration to allow the development of late toxicity (protocol 1), or sacrificed 24h after the last MTX administration to evaluate early cardiotoxicity (protocol 2). In protocol 1, no adult mice survived, while 2 of the juveniles reached the end of the protocol. High plasma aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio and a high cardiac reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio were found in the surviving MTX-treated juvenile mice. In protocol 2, a significant decrease in plasma creatine-kinase MB in juveniles was found 24h after the last MTX-administration. Cardiac histology showed that both MTX-treated populations had significant damage, although higher in adults. However, MTX-treated juveniles had a significant increase in fibrotic tissue. The MTX-treated adults had higher values of cardiac GSSG and protein carbonylation, but lower cardiac noradrenaline levels. For the first time, mature adult animals were shown to be more susceptible to MTX as evidenced by several biomarkers, while young animals appear to better adjust to the MTX-induced cardiac injury. Even so, the higher level of fibrotic tissue and the histological damage showed that MTX also causes cardiac damage in the juvenile population.
Copper is a redox active metal that is essential for biological function. Copper is potentially toxic; thus, its homeostasis is carefully regulated through a system of protein transporters. Copper is taken up across the lumen surface of the small intestinal microvilli as cuprous ion by Ctr1. Cupric ion may also be taken up, but those processes are less well understood. Within the cell, intestinal as well as others, copper is escorted to specific compartments by metallochaperones. One, CCS, donates copper to superoxide dismutase. Another, COX17, delivers copper to additional chaperones within the mitochondria for synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase. A third chaperone, Atox1, delivers copper to the secretory pathway by docking with 2 P-type ATPases. One, ATP7A, is the protein nonfunctional in Menkes disease. This protein is required for cuproenzyme biosynthesis, and in the enterocyte it is required for copper efflux to portal blood. The second, ATP7B, predominantly expressed in liver, is required for copper metallation of ceruloplasmin and biliary copper excretion. Mutations in ATP7B lead to Wilson disease. Additional intracellular hepatic copper-binding proteins COMMD1 (copper metabolism MURR1 domain) and XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) may also be required for excretion. Other proteins involved in copper homeostasis may include metallothionein and amyloid precursor protein. Plasma protein transport of copper from the intestine to liver and in systemic circulation probably includes both albumin and alpha2-macroglobulin. Changes in the expression of copper "transporters" may be useful to monitor copper status of humans, provided a suitable cell type can be sampled.
