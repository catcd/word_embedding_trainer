Several noninvasive techniques have been used for the assessment of systolic and diastolic function. In most forms of cardiac disease however systolic and diastolic dysfunction coexist, hence a combined measure of left ventricular performance may be more reflective than their assessment alone. A recently recommended new Doppler index is supposed to be useful for this purpose. This index is the ratio of the sum of both isovolumic times and the ejection time. The objective of this study was to assess the features of the new index and then to prospectively evaluate the effect of chronic amiodarone treatment on left ventricular function using the new index and standard methods in dilated cardiomyopathy.
Normal values of the new index are within a narrow range, it separates the normal and the dilated cardiomyopathy patients without overlap, it is not heart rate dependent in either group and it is not affected by either mitral regurgitation or left bundle brunch block. The index is inversely related to the relative diastolic filling time in both groups. In severe dilated cardiomyopathy after one year amiodarone treatment there was a significant decrease of heart rate, the new Doppler index and a significant increase of ejection fraction, ejection time and relative diastolic filling time. These changes were significant already at 1 month except the new index. These results suggest that the beneficial effect of amiodarone is due to the increase of diastolic filling time rather than to a positive inotropic effect.
1. The new Doppler index is simple and can be easily utilized in the differentiation of normal and abnormal left ventricular function: 2 chronic amiodarone treatment may be indicated even in the absence of arrhythmia to improve left ventricular function in severe heart failure.
After a ten days pretreatment with testosteron-propyonate administration of vasopressin induces bilateral cortical necrosis of kidneys in rats. When testosteron and cyproteron-acetate an androgen-blocking agent were given simultaneously vasopressin did not induce necrosis of the renal cortices. These findings suggest that androgen receptors of the kidney may take a part in eliciting this phenomenon.
Presented is an unusual case of a 66-year-old-resident of a long-term care facility, who manifested severe dysgeusia and impaired quality of life attributed to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril; not realized at the time was the fact that he had an adverse reaction-cough-just weeks earlier from another ACE inhibitor in the same class, quinapril, thus illustrating different adverse effects to two antihypertensives in the same class. Cough and dysgeusia are symptoms that may be easily overlooked as side effects of medications. As polypharmacy is common in nursing home settings, health care providers need to be vigilant about adverse drug reactions which are common, but preventable and often reversible.
Thalidomide has been associated with venous thrombotic events, as reported in the post-marketing surveillance reports by Celgene Corporation; as well as case reports in the literature. Seven arterial thrombotic events have been reported in patients receiving thalidomide with 3 cases occurring in patients with other predisposing conditions. We report 4 additional cases of arterial thromboses in 1 lymphoma and 3 myeloma patients treated with thalidomide. The mechanism for these events is unclear; however, it is significant that 2 patients were receiving concomitant anticoagulation with aspirin and warfarin.
During a 7 1/2-yr period we monitored a chromosomally aberrant cell line in a woman with acute granulocytic leukemia (AGL) whose disease followed a rather unusual course. Her initial remission induced with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and prednisone was maintained for 52 mo with biweekly doses of methotrexate (MTX) given orally. Because signs of liver dysfunction occurred, maintenance therapy was stopped. After 15 mo without chemotherapy, she suffered her first relapse (5 yr 7 mo after the initial diagnosis). A second remission, again induced with 6-MP and prednisone, was maintained for 1 yr, after which a second relapse occurred. Another remission lasting for only 4 mo was followed by a relapse of the leukemic process which led to her death. Cytogenetic studies of marrow cells and peripheral blood at the time of her initial diagnosis showed abnormal stem lines with characteristic chromosome markers. A small percentage of malignant cells bearing these markers persisted in her marrow during the years of her prolonged remission. At the time of her first relapse, 75% of her marrow cells had the marker karyotype, and at the time of her death (7 1/2 yr after the leukemia was diagnosed) all analyzable marrow metaphases had the characteristic chromosome changes.
Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) and remains incurable. NIK-333, a novel synthetic retinoid, prevents the recurrence of human hepatoma after surgical resection of primary tumors. We explored the effects of NIK-333 on HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells. NIK-333 inhibited cell proliferation, induced G1 arrest, and resulted in massive apoptosis in all tested HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells, whereas little effect was observed on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. NIK-333 treatment decreases the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cIAP2, and XIAP proteins. Further analysis showed that NIK-333 inactivated nuclear factor-kappaB in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines. In animal studies, treatment with NIK-333 (100 mg/kg given orally every other day) produced partial inhibition of growth of tumors of a HTLV-I-infected T-cell line transplanted s.c. in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Our results indicate that NIK-333 is a potentially useful therapeutic agent for patients with ATL.
A model of sling-trained, conscious mongrel dogs instrumented with telemetric arterial pressure transmitters and ECG leads was validated for assessment of the QT-RR interval relationship at clinically used free and total plasma concentrations of positive and negative standards with known outcomes. The beat-to-beat technique for assessing the dynamic boundaries of the individual cardiac cycles was compared to the same data with typically used averaging techniques and corrections applied. Positive standards E-4031, cisapride, terodiline, and terfenadine showed increased sensitivity toward detection at clinically relevant levels when an outlier analysis of beats beyond the normal autonomic boundary is applied. Since methods to correct the QT interval for heart rate are often confounded with changes in autonomic state, a validation of the changes with reflex tachycardia induced by vasodilatation after nitroprusside and reflex bradycardia induced by sudden vasoconstriction with phenylephrine where shown to be differentiated from direct effects of repolarization with E-4031. These changes were also demonstrated to be identical to effects observed in humans after standing or challenged with a similar dose of phenylephrine. The conscious dog is also a sensitive model for studying the arrhythmia liability induced by beat-to-beat changes in cardiac ECG restitution (the relationship between QT and TQ intervals) and hysteresis. However, some caveats based on observations may need to be considered due to inherent differences in QT intervals and sinus arrhythmia between canines and humans.
Although tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and agonistic antibodies targeting its receptors are promising cancer therapies because of their tumor selectivity, many tumors are resistant to TRAIL-based therapies. We examined whether the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin sensitized cancer cells to TRAIL agonists in vitro and in vivo and investigated the underlying mechanism.
The effects of aspirin on sensitivity to TRAIL agonists and expression of apoptosis regulators was determined in human breast cancer cell lines and xenograft tumors. The specific role of survivin depletion in the TRAIL-sensitizing effects of aspirin was determined by silencing survivin.
Aspirin sensitized human breast cancer cells, but not untransformed human mammary epithelial cells, to TRAIL-induced caspase activation and apoptosis by a cyclooxygenase-2-independent mechanism. Aspirin also sensitized breast cancer cells to apoptosis induced by a human agonistic TRAIL receptor-2 monoclonal antibody (lexatumumab). Aspirin treatment led to G1 cell cycle arrest and a robust reduction in the levels of the antiapoptotic protein survivin by inducing its proteasomal degradation, but did not affect the levels of many other apoptosis regulators. Silencing survivin with small interfering RNAs sensitized breast cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, underscoring the functional role of survivin depletion in the TRAIL-sensitizing actions of aspirin. Moreover, aspirin acted synergistically with TRAIL to promote apoptosis and reduce tumor burden in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model.
Aspirin sensitizes transformed breast epithelial cells to TRAIL-based therapies in vitro and in vivo by a novel mechanism involving survivin depletion. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence for the therapeutic utility of this combination.
In previous work we found that weekly injections of the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) induced spontaneous aortic plaques in cockerels to grow to a larger size and at a faster rate than plaques in control animals. To determine whether plaque-stimulating ability is related to carcinogenic potency or mutagenicity we have now tested a variety of agents, including PAH carcinogens, non-PAH carcinogens and weakly carcinogenic PAHs. Cockerels were injected weekly (from 4-20 weeks of age) with one of the following compounds: benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), benzo[e]pyrene (B[e]P), dibenz[a,h]anthracene (AH), dibenz[a,c]anthracene (AC), 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA), acetylaminofluorene (AAF), N-methyl-N,N'-nitro-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or anthracene (ANT). Plaques were present in the abdominal aortas of all animals. Plaque volumes were 8-14 times greater in AC-, B[a]P-, B[e]P-, MCA- and AH-treated cockerels than in controls. Plaques were slightly larger in the AAF-treated group than in control animals, and in the ANT- and MNNG-treated groups were indistinguishable in size from plaques in control animals. The largest plaque volumes were in AH-treated cockerels and were comparable in size to those elicited by DMBA treatment. The accelerated development of plaques is consistent with a 'promotional' role for these agents. There was a poor correlation between mutagenicity or carcinogenicity and plaque 'promotion', which may reflect a role for different metabolites in these processes.
The thiazolidinedione (TZD) ring is a constituent of the glitazones that are used to treat type II diabetes. Liver injury has been reported following chronic glitazone use; however, they do not produce hepatic damage in common laboratory animal species. In contrast, 3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-2,4-thiazolidinedione (DCPT) causes hepatotoxicity in rats. DCPT toxicity is dependent upon the presence of an intact TZD ring and cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated biotransformation. To further investigate TZD ring-induced toxicity, DCPT and several structural analogues or potential metabolites were tested in vitro using wild type human hepatoma HepG2 and HepG2 cells stably transfected with the CYP3A4 isozyme. CYP3A4 activity was confirmed by measuring testosterone 6β-hydroxylation. Both cell lines were treated with 0-250 μM of the compounds in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cell viability was measured after 24 h. DCPT and S-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)aminocarbonyl thioglycolic acid (DCTA) were the most toxic compounds of the series. Furthermore, DCPT was significantly more toxic in transfected cells (LC50=160.2±5.9 μM) than in wild type cells (LC50=233.0±19.7 μM). Treatment with a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer attenuated or potentiated DCPT cytotoxicity, respectively. These results suggest that DCPT-induced cytotoxicity in the transfected HepG2 cells is partially dependent on CYP3A4.
Combined treatment with radiation has improved the outcome in various cancers and many radiosensitizers are used to enhance the therapeutic efficiency of radiotherapy. Withaferin A (Wit A), a natural compound derived from the medicinal plant Withania somnifera, has been reported for its anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects. In this study, we show that Wit A enhances the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis in human lymphoma U937 cells. Wit A-enhanced IR-induced apoptosis is associated with the PARP cleavage, caspase-3 activation, as well as specifically down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, suggesting that Wit A may be useful as a potential radiosensitizer. In addition, pretreatment of U937 cells with SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) or SB203589 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) dose-dependently inhibited the proteolytic cleavage of PARP. We provide the evidence here that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Bcl-2 down-regulation and activation of MAPKs pathway are critically involved in the apoptosis induced by Wit A and radiation.
The goal of this work was to identify potential host immune responses to thymidine kinase (TK) suicide gene-modified tumors undergoing chemoablation induced by the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV). The aims were to measure the efficacy and specificity of immunity induced against unmodified tumor, to identify qualitative or quantitative changes in the host response to TK+ tumors undergoing chemoablation that may contribute to the induction of antitumor immunity, and to compare critically the induction of immunity by chemoablation of TK-modified tumors with that of other methods of immunization in this tumor model and in response to other well-defined model antigens. Animals treated with TK+ tumors and GCV developed specific resistance to rechallenge with unmodified tumor. GCV induced significant tumor necrosis, which was associated with a pronounced host cell infiltrate composed of polymorphonuclear cells, both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and increased intratumoral IL-12. Cyclophosphamide-treated mice exhibited no such host response despite the induction of tumor necrosis. CTL responses to defined antigens in TK+ cells were greater in animals treated with prodrug than were those in animals not treated with prodrug but harboring live TK+ cells. Similar degrees of immunity were produced by immunization with irradiated cells.
Genes potentially involved in the pathology of canine atopic dermatitis (AD) were identified using gene expression microarrays. Total RNA extracted from skin biopsies was hybridized to an Agilent Technologies custom-designed 22K canine array. The arrays were analysed using Genedata Analyst software. Data were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing and tested for significance using the National Institute on Aging array analysis tool. For comparison, data were divided into separate groups: lesional atopic (n = 16), nonlesional atopic (n = 17) and healthy controls (n = 9). Fifty-four genes were differentially expressed at a significance level of 0.05 in canine AD compared to healthy controls. Sixteen genes were differentially expressed in both nonlesional and lesional atopic skin, 26 genes only in nonlesional skin and 12 only in lesional skin. These genes were associated with innate immune and inflammatory responses, cell cycle, apoptosis, barrier formation and transcriptional regulation. The most dysregulated gene in lesional skin was S100A8, which showed an almost 23-fold increase in expression. This is a pro-inflammatory cytokine located in the epidermal differentiation complex. Microarray analysis is a novel technique in canine AD. Significant changes in gene expression were identified in atopic skin. These were relevant to skin barrier formation and the immune response, suggesting that they both participate in AD. Gene expression restricted to lesional skin may be involved in inflammatory changes, whereas those shared or restricted to nonlesional skin may reflect the atopic phenotype. Investigating gene polymorphisms in the targets identified in this study will help improve our understanding of the genetic basis of this disease.
Mutations in the connexin 31 (GJB3) gene have been found in subjects with dominant and recessive deafness and in patients with erythrokeratodermia variabilis. We report here a dominant mutation in the GJB3 gene (D66del) in a family affected with peripheral neuropathy and sensorineural hearing impairment. A wide range of disease severity for peripheral neuropathy, from asymptomatic cases to subjects with chronic skin ulcers in their feet and osteomyelitis leading to amputations, was detected in D66del patients. Mild, often asymmetrical, hearing impairment was found in all but one patient with mutation D66del of this family and the same mutation was present in an independent family ascertained because of hearing impairment. We have found mouse connexin 31 (Gjb3) gene expression in the cochlea and in the auditory and sciatic nerves, showing a pattern similar to that of Gjb1 (connexin 32), of which the human ortholog (GJB1) is involved in X-linked peripheral neuropathy. This expression pattern, together with auditory-evoked brainstem anomalous response in D66del patients, indicates that hearing impairment due to GJB3 mutations involves alterations in both the cochlea and the auditory nerve. Peripheral neuropathy is the third phenotypic alteration linked to GJB3 mutations, which enlarges the list of genes that cause this group of heterogeneous disorders.
The conversion of early stage tumors into invasive malignancies with an aggressive phenotype has been associated with the irreversible loss of E-cadherin expression. The loss of E-cadherin expression in human tumors, including breast cancer, has been attributed to promoter CpG island hypermethylation and direct inhibition by transcriptional repressors. Recent evidence demonstrates that up-regulation of E-cadherin by microRNA-200b (miR-200b) and miR-200c through direct targeting of transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, ZEB1, and ZEB2, inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a crucial process in the tumor progression. We demonstrate that microRNA miR-200 family-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of E-cadherin in mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells is associated directly with translational repression of ZEB1 and indirectly with increased acetylation of histone H3 at the E-cadherin promoter. The increase in histone H3 acetylation may be attributed to the disruption of repressive complexes between ZEB1 and histone deacetylases and to the inhibition of SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase. These events inhibit EMT and reactivate a less aggressive epithelial phenotype in cancer cells. Additionally, disruption of ZEB1-histone deacetylase repressor complexes and down-regulation of SIRT1 histone deacetylase up-regulate proapoptotic genes in the p53 apoptotic pathway resulting in the increased sensitivity of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin.
We report the first case presenting with successive anaphylactic reaction and extra-pyramidal syndrome after treatment with thiethylperazine maleate (thiethylperazine). Both reactions were caused due to this anti-emetic drug, but an additive effect of clemastine fumarate, prescribed to treat the anaphylactic reaction, is suggested by the sequence of events. We discuss the importance of knowing the pharmacological similitudes of common prescribed drugs in order to avoid the occurrence of side effects.
Cerebral edema is a potential life-threatening complication in patients with acute liver failure who progress to grade III/IV encephalopathy. The incidence is variably reported but appears to be most prevalent in those patients with hyperacute liver failure as opposed to subacute forms of liver failure. In those patients who are deemed at risk of cerebral edema and raised intracranial pressure, insertion of an intra-cranial pressure monitoring device may be considered to optimize treatment and interventions. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema in this setting remains controversial, although recent work suggests a pivotal role for arterial ammonia, whose effects appear to be potentiated by the presence of systemic inflammation. Recent work has also suggested the import of free radical formation occurring at a mitochondrial level as being the potential mediator of cellular dysfunction as opposed to ammonia per se. Treatment of such patients requires a multi-disciplinary approach incorporating both hepatology and critical care. In a significant proportion of such cases, consideration of liver transplantation may be required. Treatment should be focused at optimizing liver function and regenerative capacity and minimizing the inflammatory milieu. Controlled studies are lacking and much of the management has been extrapolated from neurocritical care. Sustained elevation of intracranial pressure may be responsive to mannitol or hypertonic saline bolus, and in those with hyperemia indomethacin has been reported as beneficial in case series. Recently, interest has developed into the use of cooling in the management of patients with acute liver failure and raised intracranial pressure. Animal studies support this treatment option as do case series, although randomized trials are still awaited.
The irritancy of Nickel (Ni) ions has been well documented clinically. However, the chemical mediators involved in the acute inflammation induced by solid Ni are not fully understood. We used the Ni wire-implantation model in mice and examined roles of prostaglandins and histamine in plasma leakage in the acute phase. The subcutaneous implantation of a Ni wire into the back of mice induced plasma leakage from 8 to 24 h and tissue necrosis around the wire at 3 days, whereas the implantation of an aluminum wire induced no such inflammatory responses. An increase in the mRNA for cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and HDC in cells around the Ni wire was detected 4 h after the implantation. The leakage of plasma at 8 h was inhibited by indomethacin in a dose-dependent manner. Dexamethasone and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 also inhibited the exudation of plasma consistent with the inhibition of the expression of COX-2 mRNA. Furthermore, plasma leakage was partially but siginificantly reduced in histamine H1 receptor knockout mice and histidine decarboxylase (HDC) knockout mice but not in H2 receptor knockout mice. These results suggested that the Ni ions released from the wire induced the expression of COX-2 and HDC, resulting in an increase in vascular permeability during the acute phase of inflammation.
Topotecan, a potent inhibitor of the enzyme topoisomerase I, has shown an interesting activity against several types of solid tumors, most notably small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and ovarian cancer. We conducted a phase I study to evaluate the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan given in a novel schedule of administration in patients with refractory solid tumors.
Twenty-six patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumors refractory to all known forms of effective therapy were enrolled. The patients' median age was 61 years, 15 were male, and 18 had a performance status of (WHO) 0-1. Seven patients suffered from ovarian cancer, 11 from SCLC, 4 from non-SCLC, 2 from melanoma and 2 from cervical cancer. Topotecan was given for 3 consecutive days as a 30-min intravenous infusion, at doses ranging from 0.75 to 1.2 mg/m2. Treatment was repeated every 2 weeks.
At dose level 5 with topotecan 1.2 mg/m2, both study patients presented DLTs (1 patient grade 4 neutropenia and the other grade 3 fatigue), and the recommended doses for future phase II studies are topotecan 1.1 mg/m2 for 3 consecutive days every 2 weeks. A total of 60 treatment cycles were administered, with a median of 2 cycles per patient. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 11 (18%) cycles and 2 of them were complicated by fever requiring patient hospitalization. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was seen in 2 (3%) cycles and grade 3 anemia in 3 (5%). Although non-hematologic toxicity was generally mild, grade 2/3 fatigue complicated 12 (20%) cycles and grade 4 one (1.5%) requiring treatment interruption in 4 patients. Among 18 evaluable patients, no objective response to treatment was observed.
This phase I study demonstrates that topotecan given at the dose of 1.1 mg/m2 for 3 consecutive days every 2 weeks is a safe and tolerable regimen and possibly permits the combination of the drug with other cytotoxic agents at clinically relevant doses.
A 10-year-old boy with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and severe bone marrow failure was treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide, busulfan, and antithymocyte globulin followed by an infusion of human leukocyte antigen-identical, mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) non-reactive sibling bone marrow. He developed cardiac arrhythmias and intractable hypotension and died on day 23 posttransplant. Autopsy findings were consistent with cyclophosphamide-induced pancarditis. The bone marrow showed signs of early engraftment. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be a treatment alternative for Shwachman-Diamond syndrome with severe bone marrow failure. However, fatal posttransplant pancarditis due to doses of cyclophosphamide not usually associated with cardiac death may be an unanticipated problem. Further trials of bone marrow transplantation as therapy for this syndrome may be warranted, perhaps using lower doses of cyclophosphamide or substituting for it other immunosuppressive and myelosuppressive agents.
Gonadally-intact or castrated and testosterone-(T) treated male mice display aggressive behavior towards olfactory-bulbectomized male (OBM) stimuli, but not towards lactating female (LF) stimuli. By comparison, T-treated female mice display aggressive behavior towards both OBM and LF stimuli. The purpose of the present experiment was to determine if male mice given hyperphysiological T-treatment would display "female-typical" attack of OBM and LF stimuli. Hyperphysiological T-stimulation did not lead to the display of aggressive behavior towards OBM and LF stimuli; only OBM stimuli were attacked, suggesting a qualitative behavioral sex difference in response to T. However, the major finding of this study occurred following the termination of T-treatment. Castrated males that had previously received hyperphysiological T-treatment began to attack LF stimuli within 48 hr of treatment termination. By comparison, castrated males that had previously received physiological T-stimulation, as well as a gonadally-intact control group, generally began to attack LF stimuli 3-4 weeks following treatment-termination/castration. It is suggested that this unusual treatment-termination-induced behavioral display occurs via neurochemical mediation.
Adrenaline is vital in the treatment of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), however it is often underutilised or inappropriately administered. Adrenaline treatment is not without risk and most adverse reactions to adrenaline occur when it is given in overdose or as an intravenous bolus. We report a case of myocardial injury and hypotension following inappropriate administration of adrenaline.
