Liver transplantation (LT) may be life-saving in severe acute liver failure (ALF). The aim of this study was to compare the utilization of LT in acetaminophen and non-acetaminophen ALF. Between 1992 and 2006, 469 patients with ALF were admitted, and 104 underwent LT. Acetaminophen was the most common etiology, but LT proceeded more frequently in the non-acetaminophen cohort (acetaminophen: 45/326 patients received LT, 13.8%; non-acetaminophen: 59/143 patients received LT, 41.3%; P < 0.01). A retrospective analysis of the individual steps in the management of patients revealed more ALF patients in the non-acetaminophen cohort fulfilled the King's College Hospital poor prognostic criteria (non-acetaminophen: 91/143, 63.6%; acetaminophen: 165/326, 50.6%; P < 0.01), more patients had contraindications to LT in the acetaminophen cohort (acetaminophen: 99/165, 60%; non-acetaminophen: 21/91, 23.1%; P < 0.01), and survival on the LT waiting list was reduced in the acetaminophen cohort (acetaminophen: 45/66, 68.2%; non-acetaminophen: 59/70, 84.3%; P < 0.05). Post-LT survival was similar in the 2 groups. An analysis of cohorts admitted in 1993-1996 and 2002-2005 revealed that LT proceeded less commonly in acetaminophen ALF in the later cohort (1993-1996: 16/99 LT, 16.2%; 2002-2005: 4/81 LT, 5%; P < 0.01) in comparison with the non-acetaminophen cohort, in which transplantation proceeded more commonly in the later cohort (1993-1996: 11/34 LT, 32.4%; 2002-2005: 24/49 patients, 49.0%; P < 0.01). This was due to an increase in the number of patients with psychiatric contraindications to transplantation (predominantly resistant and severe alcohol dependence). In conclusion, at all decision steps between admission and emergency LT, LT is favored in non-acetaminophen patients, and nonoperative management is favored in acetaminophen ALF patients.
A 70 year old male developed marrow aplasia and pancytopenia after receiving 10 mg of colchicine intravenously over a period of 5 days for acute gouty arthritis. Despite a fatal outcome, evidence of recovery of hematopoiesis was observed in the bone marrow 3 days after the last dose of the drug. The pathogenetic mechanism by which colchicine induced marrow aplasia in this patient remains unclear.
To report a case of acute pediatric lamotrigine ingestion resulting in seizures.
A 2-year-old boy presented to the emergency department after an acute ingestion of up to 43 mg/kg of lamotrigine. He had 2 generalized seizures, with the first occurring 60 minutes after ingestion. Examination revealed alternate drowsiness and irritability, as well as nystagmus and hyperreflexia. Results of electrocardiogram, blood glucose, complete blood count, urea, electrolytes, and venous blood gas evaluations were all within normal limits. There was a mildly raised lactate level of 3.4 mEq/L (reference range 0.7-2.5). He was given intravenous diazepam 1 mg for irritability. After a 12-hour observation period, the patient was discharged with no further complications.
The Naranjo probability scale in this case suggested a probable causality between the acute lamotrigine ingestion and seizures. This is the lowest acute dose causing pediatric seizure reported in the literature; however, this dose is still significantly higher than a therapeutic dose. A MEDLINE search (1966-January 2010) using the search terms lamotrigine, seizures, toxicity, overdose, ingestion, and pediatric/paediatric, not limited to English-language literature, revealed 5 other cases of seizures in children after lamotrigine ingestion. In all the acute cases, time to first seizure onset ranged from 20 to 60 minutes after ingestion. Two children had gastrointestinal decontamination, both after the onset of seizures. All had full recovery with supportive care.
Lamotrigine has the ability to cause seizures in children from acute single ingestion at a lower dose than previously described. There is not enough information available to establish a toxic dose or dose that requires hospital assessment. Gastrointestinal decontamination should be contraindicated. Supportive care, including administration of benzodiazepines, is appropriate.
Ebrotidine is a new H2 receptor antagonist that potentiates the gastric mucosal barrier.
To compare ebrotidine with other anti-secretory drugs in the prevention and healing of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions.
Three different models of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions were used. (1) Fasted rat model: indomethacin was intra-gastrically administered in rats pre-treated with different doses of the anti-secretory drugs. (2) Re-fed rat model: rats orally treated with different doses of anti-secretory drugs had free access to chow pellets and were then treated with parenteral indomethacin. (3) Healing model: either oral or parenteral anti-secretory drugs were given after indomethacin administration. Computer-assisted analysis of the area of damage was expressed as ulcer index. Gastric secretion was evaluated in the pylorus-ligated rat model.
Inhibition of acid secretion was in the order omeprazole > ebrotidine = ranitidine. Ebrotidine at the highest dose used (100 mg/kg) and omeprazole, but not ranitidine, significantly prevented indomethacin-induced corpus (fasted rat) and antrum (re-fed rat) gastric lesions. In the ulcer healing model, oral administration of omeprazole and both ranitidine and ebrotidine at the highest dose used improved the ulcer index. The parenteral administration of these drugs had a lesser effect than the oral route and was in the order ebrotidine > omeprazole > ranitidine.
Ebrotidine is effective in both the prevention and healing of indomethacin-induced experimental gastric lesions. In these models, the effect of ebrotidine is comparable to omeprazole and more effective than ranitidine.
Protection afforded by trialkyl phosphorothionates against the lung injury caused by trialkyl phosphorothiolates probably results from the inhibition by the P = S moiety of the thionates, of one or more pulmonary cytochrome P-450 isozymes. The aromatic hydrocarbons p-xylene and pseudocumene also protect against this injury and inhibit some P-450 isozymes, but by a different mechanism. OOS-Trimethylphosphorothionate and p-xylene were compared as protective agents against the effect of OOS-trimethylphosphorothiolate and two other lung toxins ipomeanol and 1-nitronaphthalene that are known to be activated by cytochrome P-450. The effects of these protective compounds, in vivo, on pulmonary cytochrome P-450 activity were also determined. Both compounds inhibited pentoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity, but not ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase. The phosphorothionate was most effective against lung injury caused by the phosphorothiolates and 1-nitronaphthalene, whereas p-xylene was much more effective against ipomeanol. beta-Naphthoflavone, which induces pulmonary ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity, did not protect against phosphorothiolate or 1-nitronaphthalene injury, and it was only marginally effective in decreasing the toxicity of ipomeanol.
To investigate the behavioural role of mesocortical dopamine innervation we performed bilateral microinjections of haloperidol into various parts of the rat frontal cortex and into adjacent subcortical forebrain structures. Haloperidol (2.5 micrograms/0.5 microliter) locally injected into the medial prefrontal cortex or into the rostral part of the neostriatum resulted in the development of catalepsy as measured in the bar test. In contrast, injections of haloperidol into the nucleus accumbens, more caudal parts of the neostriatum, anterior cingulate cortex, rostral and lateral parts of the prefrontal cortex and into the lateral ventricles failed to induce catalepsy. It is concluded that blockade of dopamine receptors located in the rostral neostriatum and in the medial prefrontal cortex contributes to the development of haloperidol induced catalepsy.
We report the case of a 32-year-old man with portal hypertension without cirrhosis due to chronic vitamin A intoxication. Portal hypertension revealed by oesophageal varice rupture progressively worsened and ascites occurred 5 years after the patient stopped vitamin A intake. Initially, serum retinyl palmitate concentration was increased whereas serum retinol concentration was normal. There was no hepatic fibrosis on light microscopic examination of liver biopsy specimens. Five years after the patient stopped excessive vitamin A intake, serum retinol and retinol-binding protein concentrations were below the normal range even though there was an increased hepatic retinyl ester content. This was attributed to the late development of peri-sinusoidal fibrosis. This case mainly shows the importance of retinyl ester level determination: serum retinyl palmitate should be measured immediately after intoxication and hepatic retinyl esters should be measured initially and particularly later. Indeed, later serum and hepatic retinol levels in chronic hyper-vitaminosis A may be normal and lead to under-estimation of liver vitamin A overload.
Results of previous studies suggest that the stress response protects cells and tissues by regulating proinflammatory mediators. The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitory protein, I kappa B, regulates many genes involved in inflammatory responses to critical illness. Endotoxemia is associated with increased NF-kappa B activity in intestinal mucosa, but the effect of the stress response on endotoxin-induced NF-kappa B activation in intestinal mucosa is not known.
Induction of the stress response inhibits NF-kappa B DNA binding activity in jejunal mucosa during endotoxemia.
The stress response was induced in mice by hyperthermia (42 degrees C) or injection with sodium arsenite (10 mg/kg). After 2 to 5 hours, mice were injected with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, 12.5 mg/kg) or a corresponding volume of sterile saline. One hour later, jejunal mucosa was harvested for preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts.
Mucosal levels of heat shock protein-72 increased after hyperthermia or treatment with sodium arsenite, consistent with induction of the stress response. The increase in NF-kappa B DNA binding activity and decrease in I kappa B-alpha levels seen after endotoxin injection were inhibited by previous induction of the stress response.
The protective effects of the stress response in vivo might, at least in part, be due to inhibited NF-kappa B activation.
This paper reports on four pregnancies with maternal liver tumors induced by oral contraceptives. No increase in size and no rupture of these liver lesions were observed during the gestational and postpartum period. The toxic potentials of orally active sex steroids and the role of natural sex steroids are discussed. Criteria for differential diagnosis and practical suggestions are presented.
Chronic alcohol intake is known to induce permanent cognitive deficits along with enhanced oxidative-nitrosative stress and activation of neuroinflammatory cascade. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic phytoalexin against chronic alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction and neuroiflammatory cascade in the brain of adult rats chronically administered ethanol. Male Wistar rats were adminstered ethanol (10g/kg; oral gavage) for ten weeks and treated with resveratrol (5, 10 and 20mg/kg) for the same duration. Ethanol-exposed rats showed impaired spatial navigation in the Morris water maze test and poor retention in the elevated plus maze task which was coupled with enhanced acetylcholinesterase activity, increased oxidative-nitrosative stress, cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta), NF-kappa β and caspase-3 levels in different brain regions (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) of ethanol-treated rats. Co-administration with resveratrol significantly and dose-dependently prevented all the behavioral, biochemical and molecular deficits. Correlatively, the results of the present study revealed that treatment with resveratrol significantly prevented cognitive deficits induced by chronic ethanol exposure not only by modulating oxido-nitrosative stress but also by attenuating the enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), NF-kβ and caspase-3 in different brain regions of ethanol treated rats. Therefore, mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol observed in our study may be due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuromodulating activities.
Galectin-3, a multifunctional beta-galactoside-binding lectin, is known to participate in development, oncogenesis, cell-to-cell attachment, and inflammation. We studied to determine whether galectin-3 is associated with cell injury and regeneration in two types of acute renal failure (ARF), namely ischemic and toxic ARF. In ischemia/reperfusion renal injury in rats (bilateral renal pedicles clamped for 40 minutes), galectin-3 mRNA began to increase at 2 hours and extended by 6.2-fold at 48 hours (P: < 0.01 versus normal control rats), and then decreased by 28 days after injury. In addition, a significant negative correlation between galectin-3 mRNA expression and serum reciprocal creatinine was shown at 48 hours after injury (n = 13, r = -0.94, P: < 0.0001). In folic acid-induced ARF, galectin-3 mRNA was found to be up-regulated at 2 hours after injury and increased levels continued until at least 7 days post-injury. In immunohistochemistry, at 2 hours following reperfusion, galectin-3 began to develop in proximal convoluted tubules. From 6 hours up to 48 hours, galectin-3 was also found in proximal straight tubules, distal tubules, thick ascending limbs, and collecting ducts. In later stages of regeneration, galectin-3 expressions were found in macrophages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that galectin-3 expressions were markedly up-regulated in both ischemic and toxic types of ARF. Galectin-3 may play an important role in acute tubular injury and the following regeneration stage.
We report data showing that developed pressure (DPmax) may lead to opposite conclusion with respect to maximal developed circumferential wall stress (sigma max) when used to assess contractile function in left ventricle isovolumic preparations. Isovolumetric left ventricle preparations of rats with cardiac hypertrophy (H; N = 10) induced by isoproterenol administration showed higher DPmax (174 +/- 14 mmHg) than control (C; N = 8) animals (155 +/- 12 mmHg) or rats with regression (R; N = 8) of hypertrophy (144 +/- 11 mmHg). In contrast, the estimated sigma max for C (145 +/- 26 kdynes/cm2) and R (133 +/- 17 kdynes/cm2) was higher than for H (110 +/- 13 kdynes/cm2). According to Laplace's law, the opposite results of DPmax and sigma max may depend on the increased mass/volume left ventricle ratio of the hypertrophied hearts, which favored pressure generation. These results clearly show that DPmax should be used with caution to analyze systolic function.
In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanism by which homocysteine causes neuronal cell apoptosis. We further investigated the mechanisms of melatonin's ability to reduce homocysteine-induced apoptosis. Consistent with its antioxidant properties, melatonin reduced homocysteine-induced lipid peroxidation and stimulated glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity in hippocampus of rats with hyperhomocysteinemia. Furthermore, melatonin treatment diminished cytochrome c release from mitochondria and reduced caspase 3 and caspase 9 activation induced by hyperhomocysteinemia. Chronic hyperhomocysteinemia also led to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and subsequently DNA fragmentation. Treatment with melatonin markedly inhibited poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and reduced DNA damage. Hyperhomocysteinemia caused an elevation of pro-apoptotic Bax levels while reducing anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, levels. Daily administration of melatonin up-regulated Bcl-2 and down-regulated Bax levels. We propose that, in addition to its antioxidant properties, melatonin has the ability to protect neuronal cells against apoptosis mediated homocysteine neurotoxicity by modulating apoptosis-regulatory proteins in the hippocampus of rats.
Cytarabine was temporally associated with aseptic meningitis syndrome in an 8-year-old Hispanic girl being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Topical anesthesia using 60% lidocaine tape reduces the incidence of propofol injection pain. We conducted a randomized prospective double-blinded placebo-controlled study to assess the analgesic efficacy of pretreatment with topical 5% lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) cream in 90 ASA physical status I and II adult patients scheduled to undergo day-case gynecological surgery. Propofol injection pain was not reduced by pretreatment with EMLA cream, whereas the addition of lidocaine to propofol did significantly reduce propofol injection pain compared with the control group (P = 0.002). We conclude that topical anesthesia with EMLA cream applied for 60 min does not significantly reduce propofol injection pain.
Little data exist on the neuropsychological effects of crack-cocaine dependence or crack-cocaine and alcohol dependence. This study examined cognitive function in abstinent crack dependent and crack and alcohol dependent individuals at 6 weeks and 6 months abstinence.
a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, including the MicroCog computerized assessment, was administered to 20 abstinent crack dependent subjects, 37 abstinent crack and alcohol dependent subjects, and 29 normal controls. Depression was examined as a covariate, and the association between substance use variables and neuropsychological performance was examined.
the two substance dependent groups had similar neuropsychological profiles at 6 weeks abstinent, with both groups exhibiting significant cognitive impairment in a wide range of functions compared to controls. The substance dependent groups were still impaired significantly at 6 months of abstinence. Only mild effects of depression on neuropsychological performance were observed.
crack dependence and crack and alcohol dependence may lead to severe and persistent neuropsychological deficits over a wide range of domains. The strongest predictor of brain damage associated with substance dependence in this sample was dose (particularly quantity and duration of peak dose).
Stress plays an important role in substance abuse problems. For example, in studies with rodents stress induces reinstatement of opioid and cocaine self-administration. In addition, attenuation of the stress response by pharmacological adrenalectomy using ketoconazole, a cortisol synthesis inhibitor, reduces cocaine self-administration in rodents. In contrast, studies in primates and humans have produced conflicting results using cortisol synthesis inhibitors for attenuating cocaine-related behaviors and subjective effects. To explore the treatment implications of these findings, ketoconazole's (600-900 mg daily) ability to reduce heroin and cocaine use was compared with placebo in 39 methadone maintained patients with a history of cocaine abuse or dependence during a 12-week double blind trial. Contrary to the predicted effects, both heroin and cocaine use increased after patients were stabilized on methadone and ketoconazole. Depressive and withdrawal symptoms improved no more with ketoconazole than with placebo treatment, and side effects were greater on ketoconazole than placebo. As reported before with methadone treatment, morning cortisol levels were significantly lower than normal values throughout the clinical trial, but were not lower with ketoconazole than placebo treatment. Thus, in agreement with the negative results from acute dosing studies in primates and humans, chronic ketoconazole treatment does not appear to reduce cocaine or opioid use in humans maintained on methadone.
21 Patients with malignant brain tumors were treated with vincristine (1,4 mg/m2) in the course of combination chemotherapie, given in 14 days series over 3 months up to 26 month. 18 patients developed clinical signs of a sensory and 4 patients of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy. Changes in nerve conduction velocity of the N. peronaeus and N. suralis and amplitude of the evoked muscle response (M. extensor digitorum brevis) and nerve action potential were studied in dependency of the total vincristine dosage. The following conclusions were drawn. 1. Clinical occurrence of vincristine polyneuropathy and decrease of nerve conduction velocity of peroneal and sural nerve and the amplitude of the muscle response and nerve action potential are dosage dependent. 2. Sensory fibres appear to be damaged earlier and more severe than motor fibers, but this difference was statistically not significant. 3. Nerve conduction velocity of peroneal and sural nerve is normal or slightly decreased in vincristine polyneuropathy, but the amplitude of the evoked response in extensor digitorum brevis muscle and of the nerve action potential of the suralis nerve are markedly diminished. This result indicates that vincristine polyneuropathy is of primary axonal orgin. 4. If vincristine dosage is reduced to half or vincristine is discontinued after a reduction of the potential amplitude in the extensor digitorum brevis muscle below 1 mV, severe, not reversible polyneuropathies may be avoided.
The intracellular oxidative stress has been involved in bile acid-induced cell death in hepatocytes. Nitric oxide (NO) exerts cytoprotective properties in glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA)-treated hepatocytes. The study evaluated the involvement of Ca2+ on the regulation of NO synthase (NOS)-3 expression during N-acetylcysteine (NAC) cytoprotection against GCDCA-induced cell death in hepatocytes. The regulation of Ca2+ pools (EGTA or BAPTA-AM) and NO (L-NAME or NO donor) production was assessed during NAC cytoprotection in GCDCA-treated HepG2 cells. The stimulation of Ca2+ entrance was induced by A23187 in HepG2. Cell death, Ca2+ mobilization, NOS-1, -2 and -3 expression, AP-1 activation, and NO production were evaluated. GCDCA reduced intracellular Ca2+ concentration and NOS-3 expression, and enhanced cell death in HepG2. NO donor prevented, and l-NAME enhanced, GCDCA-induced cell death. The reduction of Ca2+ entry by EGTA, but not its release from intracellular stores by BAPTA-AM, enhanced cell death in GCDCA-treated cells. The stimulation of Ca2+ entrance by A23187 reduced cell death and enhanced NOS-3 expression in GCDCA-treated HepG2 cells. The cytoprotective properties of NAC were related to the recovery of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, NOS-3 expression and NO production induced by GCDCA-treated HepG2 cells. The increase of NO production by Ca2+-dependent NOS-3 expression during NAC administration reduces cell death in GCDCA-treated hepatocytes.
We report the results of the Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study, a blinded trial at 56 North American centers that compared the effects of ticlopidine hydrochloride (500 mg daily) with those of aspirin (1300 mg daily) on the risk of stroke or death. The medications were randomly assigned to 3069 patients with recent transient or mild persistent focal cerebral or retinal ischemia. Follow-up lasted for two to six years. The three-year event rate for nonfatal stroke or death from any cause was 17 percent for ticlopidine and 19 percent for aspirin--a 12 percent risk reduction (95 percent confidence interval, -2 to 26 percent) with ticlopidine (P = 0.048 for cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates). The rates of fatal and nonfatal stroke at three years were 10 percent for ticlopidine and 13 percent for aspirin--a 21 percent risk reduction (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 38 percent) with ticlopidine (P = 0.024 for cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates). Ticlopidine was more effective than aspirin in both sexes. The adverse effects of aspirin included diarrhea (10 percent), rash (5.5 percent), peptic ulceration (3 percent), gastritis (2 percent), and gastrointestinal bleeding (1 percent). With ticlopidine, diarrhea (20 percent), skin rash (14 percent), and severe but reversible neutropenia (less than 1 percent) were noted. The mean increase in total cholesterol level was 9 percent with ticlopidine and 2 percent with aspirin (P less than 0.01). The ratios of high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol were similar in both treatment groups. We conclude that ticlopidine was somewhat more effective than aspirin in preventing strokes in this population, although the risks of side effects were greater.
In patients with chronic heart failure, spironolactone added to conventional treatment may lead to serious and, occasionally, fatal hyperkalaemia. In some cases this seems to happen because spironolactone causes diarrhoea. Four cases involving men with New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure are presented. As these cases revealed, close monitoring of blood chemistry is mandatory after starting spironolactone, and patients should be advised to stop spironolactone immediately if diarrhoea develops.
Treatment with estradiol-17 beta and testosterone induces epithelial dysplasia and, subsequently, adenocarcinoma in the dorsolateral prostate of NBL rats. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this carcinogenic effect is mediated by genotoxicity. Analogous to adducts produced by estrogens in the male hamster kidney, a target of estrogen carcinogenicity, induction of DNA adducts detectable by 32P-postlabeling was investigated in the prostate target tissue. NBL rats were treated with separate Silastic tubing implants containing testosterone and estradiol-17 beta. Control animals received empty implants. Animals were killed at 8, 16 and 24 weeks after initiation of treatment, and accessory sex glands were sampled for adduct analysis. DNA of the dorsolateral and ventral prostate and the coagulating gland (= anterior prostate) was isolated and analyzed by nuclease P1-enhancement of the 32P-post-labeling assay. DNA adducts were quantitated by Cerenkov counting. An adduct occurred selectively in DNA of the dorsolateral prostate of rats treated with estradiol plus testosterone for 16 or 24 weeks with relative adduct level values of approximately 10 x 10(9), but not in DNA of the ventral or anterior prostate. The adduct was not present in DNA of prostate tissue of rats treated for 8 weeks or in DNA of control tissues. This adduct was unique with respect to chromatographic location and has not been observed before in any tissue of control or hormone-treated animals. Neither the structure of the treatment-induced adduct nor the mechanism of its formation is known. However, the selective occurrence of this adduct in the tissue of origin of the carcinomas and its appearance coinciding with putative preneoplastic lesions and preceding carcinoma development suggests a causal relation between adduct formation and prostate cancer development in testosterone plus estradiol-17 beta-treated rats.
Farmers commonly experience rhinitis but the risk factors are not well characterized. The aim of this study was to analyze cross-sectional data on rhinitis in the past year and pesticide use from 21,958 Iowa and North Carolina farmers in the Agricultural Health Study, enrolled 1993-1997, to evaluate pesticide predictors of rhinitis. Polytomous and logistic regression models were used to assess association between pesticide use and rhinitis while controlling for demographics and farm-related exposures. Sixty-seven percent of farmers reported current rhinitis and 39% reported 3 or more rhinitis episodes. The herbicides glyphosate [odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.05-1.13] and petroleum oil (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.05-1.19) were associated with current rhinitis and increased rhinitis episodes. Of the insecticides, four organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, and malathion), carbaryl, and use of permethrin on animals were predictors of current rhinitis. Diazinon was significant in the overall polytomous model and was associated with an elevated OR of 13+ rhinitis episodes (13+ episodes OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.09-1.38). The fungicide captan was also a significant predictor of rhinitis. Use of petroleum oil, use of malathion, use of permethrin, and use of the herbicide metolachlor were significant in exposure-response polytomous models. Specific pesticides may contribute to rhinitis in farmers; agricultural activities did not explain these findings.
Gentamicin, a widely used antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infection, can cause nephrotoxicity. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is a compound purified from the rhizome of Ligusticum wallichi (Chuanxiong) and has been found to protect against ischaemia-reperfusion injury, nephritis and alcohol-induced toxicity in rat kidneys.
We used rat renal tubular cells (RTCs), NRK-52E, in this study. The cytotoxicity of gentamicin was checked with transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, and the generation of reactive oxygen species was measured using the fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescein. We evaluated several apoptotic parameters: cleaved caspase levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) excretion and nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity. We also examined the TMP protective effect on gentamicin-induced apoptosis in rat kidneys.
The results of this study showed that gentamicin was found to markedly induce apoptosis in NRK-52E cells in a dose-dependent manner; that TMP expressed a dose-dependent protective effect against gentamicin-induced apoptosis; that pre-treatment of the cells with 50 or 100 microM of TMP effectively decreased the reactive oxygen species formation induced by gentamicin; that TMP was found to inactivate the gentamicin-stimulated activities of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9, to inhibit gentamicin-induced release of cytochrome c, as well as to raise the expression of Bcl-x(L); that TMP inhibited the gentamicin-induced TNF-alpha excretion, and inactivated the transcription factor NF-kappaB; and that the TMP treatment significantly reduced apoptotic injury in rat RTCs.
Based on the results of this study, we suggest that TMP can attenuate gentamicin-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic injury in rat RTCs, and that its character may have therapeutic potential for patients with renal diseases.
This report describes two patients who developed jaundice within two weeks of receiving an amoxycillin-clavulanate potassium combination. Causes of jaundice, other than drug administration, were excluded. The patients' jaundice and clinical symptoms did not respond to stopping the drug. Ursodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day) led to a prompt and sustained improvement in their hyperbilirubinaemia and symptoms such as pruritus and fatigue. These cases suggest that ursodeoxycholic acid may be an effective treatment for drug-associated cholestasis.
