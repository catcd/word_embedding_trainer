Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) reduce vascular tone in the systemic circulation. Their effects on the pulmonary circulation are unknown. The present study examined the effect of oral treatment with raloxifene (a second-generation SERM) on vasomotor reactivity in pulmonary arteries from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Pulmonary arterial rings were suspended in a multi-channel myograph, and changes in isometric tension were measured. WKY rings constricted less to U46619 than SHR rings, and the difference was eliminated after chronic treatment with raloxifene. More contraction to U46619 was obtained after inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by L-NAME (as an index of basal NO release) in raloxifene-treated than in control SHR rings. Less U46619-induced contraction after raloxifene treatment occurred only in SHR rings with endothelium, and this effect was abolished upon removal of the endothelium. Raloxifene treatment did not enhance the contribution of basal NO to U46619-induced constriction in WKY rings. Raloxifene treatment did not modify endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and endothelium-independent relaxation to nifedipine. The reduced relaxing sensitivity to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in SHR rings was normalized by raloxifene treatment. Raloxifene treatment reduced CaCl2-induced tone in SHR but not in WKY rings. The results show that chronic treatment with raloxifene could improve pulmonary vascular function in hypertensive animals by (1) increasing basal NO release, (2) reducing vascular smooth muscle tone, and (3) improving the effect of NO on vascular smooth muscle in SHR. In contrast, raloxifene has little effect on vascular reactivity in pulmonary arteries from normotensive WKY rats.
The clinical use of tacrolimus (FK506) is limited by nephrotoxicity. The pathogenesis of fibrosis in chronic FK506 nephrotoxicity remains unknown. Because transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta plays a key role in the fibrogenesis of many diseases, including cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, we studied a salt-depleted rat model of chronic FK506 nephropathy in which clinically relevant FK506 blood levels are obtained and which shows similarities to the lesions described in patients receiving FK506. Pair-fed rats were treated with either FK506 (1 mg/kg/day s.c.) or an equivalent dose of vehicle and were killed at 7 or 28 days. Characteristic histologic changes of tubular injury, interstitial fibrosis, and arteriolopathy developed in FK506-treated rats at 28 days and were accompanied by worsening kidney function, decreased concentrating ability, and enzymuria. FK506-treated kidneys had a progressive increase in the expression of TGF-beta1 and matrix proteins (biglycan, tenascin, fibronectin, and type I collagen). This effect seems to be specific because the expression of type IV collagen, a basement membrane collagen, was not affected. Matrix deposition was present mostly in the tubulointerstitium and vessels in accordance with the FK506 chronic lesion. The expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a protease inhibitor influenced by TGF-beta, followed TGF-beta1 and matrix proteins, suggesting that the fibrosis of chronic FK506 nephropathy likely involves the dual action of TGF-beta1 on matrix deposition and degradation. Since both peripheral and tissue renin expression were elevated with FK506, the renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the pathogenesis of this condition.
Toxic psychosis due to quinacrine treatment represents an infrequent, but serious psychiatric complication. Psychiatrists should be familiar with this side effect as quinacrine continues to be used as an antimalarial, as an antihelmintic and as an antineoplastic agent. A case of a young male is presented who developed an acute toxic psychosis which necessitated psychiatric hospitalization. The case is discussed in light of previously published clinical reports and experimental studies. It appears that quinacrine acts as a cortical stimulant, but the exact mechanism of its action on the CNS is not clear at this point.
High levels of both endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid receptors are present in the basal ganglia. Attention has recently focused on the role of endocannabinoids in the control of movement and in movement disorders of basal ganglia origin such as Parkinson's disease. We investigated CB1 cannabinoid receptor mRNA expression in the reserpine-treated rat model of Parkinson's disease using in situ hybridization. Reserpine treatment caused a topographically organized reduction in CB1 receptor mRNA expression in the striatum (ranging from 11.6% medially to 53.6% laterally and dorsally). No change in CB1 receptor mRNA expression was observed in the cerebral cortex or septum. This reduction in CB1 receptor mRNA expression may be secondary to increased endocannabinoid stimulation of the receptor as increased basal ganglia endocannabinoid levels have been shown to occur in this model of Parkinson's disease. The data support the idea that cannabinoid receptor antagonists may provide a useful treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Corticosteroid therapy has shown some benefit in severe acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH); however, this is limited by uncertainty in patient selection and variable clinical response. Theophylline has been shown to ameliorate impaired steroid sensitivity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by facilitating corticosteroid-induced silencing of proinflammatory genes. We aimed to explore the mechanistic basis of the variable response to corticosteroid therapy seen in patients with AAH and to address the extent to which theophylline can improve this response. The ability of dexamethasone to inhibit phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte proliferation was assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation in 12 severe AAH patients and age-matched and sex-matched controls. Steroid sensitivity was measured in terms of I(max), the maximum inhibition of proliferation. The effect of 10(-5) M theophylline and, in survivors, change in I(max) during recovery were observed. Lymphocyte steroid sensitivity was found to be significantly reduced in AAH compared with controls (I(max) 67[+/-4.5]% versus 95[+/-2.3]%, P = 0.0002) and correlated with clinical markers of steroid responsiveness. In survivors, I(max) increased in recovery. Theophylline 10(-5) M significantly increased lymphocyte steroid sensitivity (I(max) 86[+/-6.6]% versus 67[+/-5.0]%, P = 0.027).
Acute alcoholic hepatitis is associated with significant lymphocyte steroid insensitivity, which improves in recovery and can be ameliorated ex vivo by theophylline. This offers potential to rationalize corticosteroid prescribing in AAH and, furthermore, justifies investigation of this novel role for an existing pharmacological agent in this common and frequently fatal condition.
Patients with on-going HBV viral replication often present with clinical features of active chronic hepatitis. Until the recent introduction of nucleoside analogues, interferon-alpha was the only approved drug for these patients. One of the former drugs, lamivudine, has been shown in clinical trials in the US and Asia to effectively inhibit the viral polymerase of HBV. Our study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of lamivudine therapy in Polish patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Forty-five patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBeAg positive, anti-e negative, HBV-DNA positive by hybridization assay) were enrolled in the study. The patients received 100mg of lamivudine orally, once daily for 12 months. They returned for routine clinical and laboratory control every two weeks during the first months of treatment, and later at 3-month intervals while receiving lamivudine.
At the end of treatment, serum HBeAg was not detected in 21 patients (48.8%), and anti-HBe appeared in the serum of 19 patients. 37.2% of the patients in the study group showed sustained suppression of serum HBV DNA at the end of treatment. Lamivudine therapy was well tolerated, with the rate of occurrence of adverse events similar to that observed in other clinical studies.
12-month lamivudine therapy in this Polish population of patients with chronic hepatitis B induced a high rate of HBeAg seroconversion, accompanied by reduction of HBV-DNA and the normalization of alanine aminotransferase activities.
Sick building syndrome (SBS) is a set of several clinically recognizable symptoms reported by occupants of a building without a clear cause. Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) is a membrane bound serine esterase and its reaction with organophosphates (OPs) can lead to OP-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) and nerve axon degeneration. The aim of our study was to determine whether there was a difference in NTE activity in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of Japanese patients with SBS and healthy controls and whether PNPLA6 (alias NTE) gene polymorphisms were associated with SBS. We found that the enzymatic activity of NTE was significantly higher (P < 0.0005) in SBS patients compared with controls. Moreover, population with an AA genotype of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs480208, in intron 21 of the PNPLA6 gene strongly reduced the activity of NTE. Fifty-eight SNP markers within the PNPLA6 gene were tested for association in a case-control study of 188 affected individuals and 401 age-matched controls. Only one SNP, rs480208, was statistically different in genotype distribution (P = 0.005) and allele frequency (P = 0.006) between the cases and controls (uncorrected for testing multiple SNP sites), but these were not significant by multiple corrections. The findings of the association between the enzymatic activity of NTE and SBS in Japanese show for the first time that NTE activity might be involved with SBS.
Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) is a major poultry leg problem, the natural etiology of which is unknown. Certain dithiocarbamate pesticides such as tetramethyl thiuram disulfide (thiram) have been shown to induce the disease in chickens. Because many different carbamate and thiocarbamate chemicals are used in a number of agricultural, industrial, and household applications, the objective of this study was to determine whether all chemicals of these categories induce TD and whether there is a concentration-dependent relationship between the ingestion of these chemicals and the incidences and the severity of the disease. Week-old broiler chicks were fed diets containing thiram or other assorted carbamate and thiocarbamate pesticides mixed in feed for 24-48 hr between ages 8 and 10 days. The birds were killed on day 15 and the proximal tibial and tarsometatarsal growth plates were evaluated for the presence and severity of TD lesions. TD was distinguished by broadening of growth plates; upon histologic exam chondrocytes appeared to be shrunken and dead. When compared by including equimolar concentrations of these chemicals in the feed, the dithiocarbamates with more than two sulfide groups, such as disulfiram, ferbam, thiram, and ziram were potent inducers of TD, whereas those with two sulfides to no sulfide group appeared ineffective at inducing TD. Both thiram and ferbam also reduced the bird's body weights. Thiram increased the incidence and the severity of the disease, denoted by TD index, in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that inadvertent contamination of feed or litter with some of these or similar chemicals may cause leg problems in poultry.
The instillation of chemotherapeutic agents after transurethral resection of bladder tumor as an adjuvant treatment in bladder tumors is accepted as being safe if there is no associated bladder perforation. Mitomycin C (MMC) is a widely used agent for the adjuvant treatment of bladder tumors. A patient who developed MMC-induced bladder perforation and perivesical necrosis after an uneventful endoscopic tumor is presented. We suggest that the possible reason for such a complication could be deep resection at the anterior bladder wall. The treatment of the situation continued for an extended period, causing serious discomfort for the patient. Withholding immediate intravesical MMC instillation after resection of tumors on the anterior bladder wall ought to be considered in the early postoperative hours.
A patient is described with a galactorrhea-amenorrhea syndrome and an enlargement of the sella turcica. Pregnancy occurred after induction of ovulation with bromocriptine (and 2.5 years after pituitary irradiation). Periodic assessment of the visual fields showed an increase in size of the blind spots after 10 weeks and a moderate bitemporal hemianopsia after 22 weeks, which improved spontaneously after 30 weeks of pregnancy. One month after delivery the visual field of the left eye was almost normalized, while that of the right eye showed a definite improvement. Prior radiotherapy need not prevent visual complications from enlargement of pituitary adenomas during pregnancy.
Patients and physicians correctly identified medication assignments in 70% of the cases in a double-blind trial of an appetite suppressant. The breach of the double-blind design may have had therapeutic consequences; correct identification was associated with favorable outcome. These findings suggest that requirements for describing the side effects of medications to patients before they give informed consent may help them guess which medication they receive and thus may influence the integrity of double-blind studies and the results of controLled trials.
Alterations in arterial PaCO₂ can influence local anesthetic toxicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of stress-induced changes in PaCO₂ and PaO₂ on the seizure threshold of lidocaine and articaine. Lidocaine (2% with 1 : 100,000 epinephrine) or articaine (4% with 1 : 100,000 epinephrine) was administered intravenously under rest or stress conditions to 36 rats separated into 4 groups. Propranolol and prazosin were administered preoperatively to minimize cardiovascular effects of epinephrine. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial pH, PaCO₂, and PaO₂ were measured. Results showed no differences in MAP, HR, or pH. Stress significantly increased the latency period for the first tonic-clonic seizure induced by a toxic dose of both lidocaine and articaine (P < .05). Seizures were brought on more rapidly by articaine. No significant difference between toxic doses of lidocaine and articaine was noted. Stress raised the seizure threshold dose for both drugs and significantly (P < .01) increased arterial PaO₂ from 94.0 ± 1.90 mm Hg to 113.0 ± 2.20 mm Hg, and reduced PaCO₂ from 36.0 ± 0.77 mm Hg to 27.0 ± 0.98 mm Hg. In conclusion, reduction in PaCO₂ and/or increase in PaO₂ raised the seizure threshold of lidocaine and articaine. This study also confirmed that lidocaine and articaine have equipotent central nervous system toxicity.
Accumulative experimental evidence suggests feasibility of chemotherapeutic intervention targeting human cancer cells by pharmacological modulation of cellular oxidative stress. Current efforts aim at personalization of redox chemotherapy through identification of predictive tumour genotypes and redox biomarkers. Based on earlier research demonstrating that anti-melanoma activity of the pro-oxidant 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) is antagonized by cellular NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) expression, this study tested DCPIP as a genotype-directed redox chemotherapeutic targeting homozygous NQO1*2 breast carcinoma, a common missense genotype [rs1800566 polymorphism; NP_000894.1:p.Pro187Ser] encoding a functionally impaired NQO1 protein. In a panel of cultured breast carcinoma cell lines and NQO1-transfectants with differential NQO1 expression levels, homozygous NQO1*2 MDA-MB231 cells were hypersensitive to DCPIP-induced caspase-independent cell death that occurred after early onset of oxidative stress with glutathione depletion and loss of genomic integrity. Array analysis revealed upregulated expression of oxidative (GSTM3, HMOX1, EGR1), heat shock (HSPA6, HSPA1A, CRYAB) and genotoxic stress response (GADD45A, CDKN1A) genes confirmed by immunoblot detection of HO-1, Hsp70, Hsp70B', p21 and phospho-p53 (Ser15). In a murine xenograft model of human homozygous NQO1*2-breast carcinoma, systemic administration of DCPIP displayed significant anti-tumour activity, suggesting feasibility of redox chemotherapeutic intervention targeting the NQO1*2 genotype.
Adenosine A2A receptors are a new target for drug development in Parkinson's disease. Some experimental and clinical data suggest that A2A receptor antagonists can provide symptomatic improvement by potentiating the effects of L-DOPA as well as a decrease in secondary effects such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. L-DOPA-induced behavioral sensitization in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats is frequently used as an experimental model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. In the present work this model was used to evaluate the effect of the A2A receptor agonist CGS 21680 and the A2A receptor antagonist MSX-3 on L-DOPA-induced behavioral sensitization and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced striatal dopamine denervation. L-DOPA-induced behavioral sensitization was determined as an increase in L-DOPA-induced abnormal involuntary movements and enhancement of apomorphine-induced turning behavior. Striatal dopamine innervation was determined by measuring tyrosine-hydroxylase immunoreactivity. Chronic administration of MSX-3 was not found to be effective at counteracting L-DOPA-induced behavioral sensitization. On the other hand, CGS 21680 completely avoided the development of L-DOPA-induced behavioral sensitization. The analysis of the striatal dopamine innervation showed that L-DOPA-CGS 21680 co-treatment conferred neuroprotection to the toxic effects of 6-hydroxydopamine. This neuroprotective effect was dependent on A2A and D2 receptor stimulation, since it was counteracted by MSX-3 and by the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol. These results open new therapeutic avenues in early events in Parkinson's disease.
The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical for reinstatement of cocaine seeking and is the main source of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to striatal regions of the brain relapse circuitry. To test the hypothesis that BDNF in the mPFC regulates cocaine-seeking behavior, rats were trained to press a lever for cocaine infusions (0.2 mg/inf, 2 h/day) paired with light+tone conditioned stimulus (CS) presentations on 10 consecutive days. After the last self-administration session, rats received a single infusion of BDNF (0.75 microg/0.5 microL/side) into the mPFC; this manipulation produced protracted effects on cocaine-seeking behavior (non-reinforced lever pressing). BDNF pretreatment administered after the last session attenuated cocaine seeking 22 h later and, remarkably, it also blocked cocaine-induced suppression of phospho-extracellular-regulated kinase and elevated BDNF immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens. The same pretreatment also suppressed cocaine-seeking behavior elicited by response-contingent CS presentations after 6 days of forced abstinence or extinction training, as well as a cocaine challenge injection (10 mg/kg, i.p.) after extinction training. However, BDNF infused into the mPFC had no effect on food-seeking behavior. Furthermore, BDNF infused on the sixth day of abstinence failed to alter responding, suggesting that the regulatory influence of BDNF is time limited. The suppressive effects of BDNF infused into the mPFC on cocaine seeking indicate that BDNF regulates cortical pathways implicated in relapse to drug seeking and that corticostriatal BDNF adaptations during early abstinence diminish compulsive drug seeking.
The heterocyclic aromatic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4,5-f] quinoline (IQ) is one of three heterocyclic amine mutagens currently being evaluated for carcinogenic activity in nonhuman primates, primarily cynomolgus monkeys. IQ was administered by gavage five times a week at doses of 10 or 20 mg/kg. Thus far IQ induced tumors in 50 percent of the monkeys at the 10 mg/kg dose and in 85 percent of the monkeys at the 20 mg/kg dose. Because H and E sections of the myocardium from IQ-treated animals demonstrated inflammatory infiltrate and studies of IQ-DNA adducts in monkeys, by the 32P-postlabeling method, showed high levels of adducts in the heart a systematic study of cardiac pathologic changes associated with chronic administration of IQ was undertaken. Both light and electron microscopic abnormalities were seen. The possibility exists that heterocyclic aromatic amines may be etiologic factors for human cancer and myocardial disease.
We present the case of a woman with chronic migraine who unexpectedly reported full remission of headache after memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, was administered for treating concomitant mild cognitive impairment. An underlying dose-dependent effect of memantine on headache symptoms in chronic daily headache and chronic migraine could be assumed.
For the medical treatment of cholestasis plant alkaloids, phenobarbital and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) have been used. Although the mode of action of these substances is understood in part, the treatment of patients was unsuccessful. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic acid, a physiologically occurring bile acid in man, was successful. The daily dosage of ursodeoxycholic acid is 10-15 mg/kg bodyweight. Best results have been obtained in primary biliary cirrhosis where symptoms improved markedly, the cholestasis-indicating enzymes and immunoglobulin M decreased significantly. After long-term therapy even liver histology improved. Recently it has been shown that ursodeoxycholic acid prolongs the interval to liver transplantation. Ursodeoxycholic acid has to be taken lifelong, because interruption of therapy, even after long periods of continued treatment will induce a rebound of cholestasis. Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy is without side effects. In patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis ursodeoxycholic acid prolongs life expectancy only in combination with endoscopic bile duct dilatation.
We report a case of severe type IV hypersensitivity reaction to amoxicillin, which occurred in a person with a 12-year history of SLE. The present case illustrates the wide differential diagnosis in a SLE patient who presents with an allergic drug reaction. The attribution of the presenting symptoms to the underlying SLE and/or to the drugs used to treat SLE and coexisting conditions is a major challenge.
To determine whether the levels of serum myoglobin and the occurrence of fasciculations and postoperative symptoms following a single dose of succinylcholine are modified by the prior administration of midazolam.
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
Outpatient surgical service of a university hospital.
69 ASA physical status I and II healthy, adult female outpatients undergoing laparoscopy (for diagnosis or tubal ligation) with general anesthesia that included succinylcholine.
Patients received pretreatment of either a saline placebo (Group 1, n = 31) or intravenous midazolam 0.03 mg/kg (Group 2, n = 38) 5 minutes before succinylcholine.
Serum myoglobin prior to pretreatment and at 5 (t5) and 30 (t30) minutes after succinylcholine was determined by radioimmunoassay. Pain was assessed by telephone interview 24 to 36 hours postoperatively. Baseline myoglobin levels ranged from 14 to 69 ng/ml; the 5- and 30-minute samples varied widely (range, 16 to 900 ng/ml). The rise was 3 or more SDs above the baseline mean in 23% and 42% of Group 1 at t5 and t30, respectively, and in 21% and 35% of Group 2 at t5 and t30, respectively. The differences between groups were not significant. The frequency of fasciculations (77% in Group 1, 87% in Group 2), postoperative sore throat (64% in Group 1, 57% in Group 2), and myalgias (44% in Group 1, 51% in Group 2) also was not significantly different between groups.
Midazolam had no effect on myoglobin level or postoperative symptoms following succinylcholine.
The cognition-enhancing drug, nefiracetam, is in Phase III clinical trials to treat memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nefiracetam ameliorates acquisition of delay eyeblink classical conditioning in older rabbits, a form of associative learning with striking behavioral and neurobiological similarities in rabbits and humans. In both species, delay eyeblink conditioning engages the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system and is disrupted when the cholinergic system is antagonized. Delay eyeblink classical conditioning is impaired in normal aging and severely disrupted in AD.
To test further the efficacy of nefiracetam in an animal model that mimics some of the neurobiological and behavioral effects present in AD, we tested 56 older rabbits assigned to 7 treatment groups in the 750 ms delay eyeblink conditioning procedure. Older rabbits were injected with 1.5 mg/kg scopolamine to simulate disruption of the cholinergic system in AD. Three doses of nefiracetam (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg) were also injected in older rabbits receiving 1.5 mg/kg scopolamine. Control groups were treated with 1.5 mg/kg scopolamine + vehicle, vehicle alone, or explicitly unpaired presentations of conditioning stimuli and vehicle or 1.5 mg/kg scopolamine + 15 mg/kg nefiracetam.
Rabbits injected with 1.5 mg/kg scopolamine alone were impaired, but a dose of 15 mg/kg nefiracetam reversed significantly the behavioral impairment.
Nefiracetam had ameliorating effects on a task impaired in AD in an animal model of AD: older rabbits with cholinergic system antagonism.
The present study examines the effects of long-term electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve on cochlear histopathology and spiral ganglion cell survival in young sensorineural deafened cats. Eight kittens were deafened using kanamycin and ethacrynic acid, and implanted with bipolar or monopolar scala tympani electrodes. Following recovery from surgery the animals were unilaterally stimulated using charge balanced biphasic current pulses for 450-1730 hours over implant periods of up to four months. Charge densities varied from 0.6-0.9 microC.cm-2 geom. per phase for monopolar electrodes to 12-26 microC.cm-2 geom. per phase for the bipolar electrodes. Electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs) were periodically monitored during stimulation to confirm that the stimulus levels were above threshold, and to monitor any change in the response of the auditory nerve. Following completion of the stimulation program cochleae were prepared for histological examination. EABRs exhibited relatively stable thresholds for both stimulated and implanted, unstimulated control cochleae for the stimulus duration. While the growth in response amplitude as a function of stimulus current remained stable for the bipolar control and monopolar stimulated cochleae, the five cochleae chronically stimulated using bipolar electrodes exhibited a moderate to large increase in response amplitude. These increases were associated with a more widespread fibrous tissue response which may have altered the current distribution within these cochleae. Implanted control cochleae exhibited significantly less tissue response within the scala tympani. Importantly, we observed no statistically significant difference in the spiral ganglion cell density associated with chronic electrical stimulation when compared with unstimulated control cochleae. While the present study supports the safe application of cochlear implants in young profoundly deafened children, it does not corroborate previous studies that have reported electrical stimulation providing a trophic effect on degenerating auditory nerve fibres.
Herein, we describe the presenting symptoms, history, ophthalmic examination, visual fields and brain magnetic resonance imaging of a patient who developed left homonymous hemianopia due to right occipital lobe hemorrhage after ingestion of sildenafil citrate (Novagra Forte). To the best of our knowledge, association of homonymous hemianopia with sildenafil usage has not been reported before.
(1) Numerous follow-up studies of pregnancies in women with epilepsy show that valproic acid is more teratogenic than other antiepileptics. The risk of malformations increases with doses above 1000 mg/day; (2) Malformations associated with valproic acid include neural tube defects in 1-2% of exposed children, as well as urogenital, craniofacial and digital abnormalities. Cardiac disorders and limb defects have also been reported; (3) Convergent results of several cohort studies show that exposure to valproic acid in utero has detrimental effects on intelligence, language and behavior, which appear in school-age children; (4) In practice, the use of valproic acid should be avoided throughout pregnancy, as well as by women of childbearing age not using effective contraception. If a woman is planning pregnancy, the choice of valproic acid should be reassessed with the patient. If valproic acid therapy is maintained, the minimum effective daily dose should be determined and folic acid supplementation initiated.
To compare the biological activity of losartan as seen in several animal studies with results from similar clinical studies in hypertensive patients or normal volunteers.
With regard to oral bioavailability and estimates of oral angiotensin II blocking activity, the animal models were reasonably good predictors of the human response. Although formation of the major losartan metabolite E 3174 differs according to species, both animal and human studies suggest an association between plasma drug levels and angiotensin II blockade. The finding that losartan demonstrated increased sensitivity during salt depletion in animals was confirmed in humans. Possible beneficial effects on renal function await further detailed clinical trials.
Losartan has been shown to lower blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. However, cross-species comparisons are difficult because, unlike humans, animal models of hypertension follow clearly defined hypertensive mechanisms. Differing profiles of E 3174 metabolite formation also make cross-species comparisons difficult.
Low plasma adiponectin has been identified as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Our objective was to determine the extent to which low maternal plasma adiponectin is predictive of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a condition that is biochemically and epidemiologically similar to type 2 diabetes. We used a prospective, nested case-control study design to compare maternal plasma adiponectin concentrations in 41 cases with 70 controls. Subjects were selected from a population of 968 women who provided blood samples in early pregnancy. Plasma adiponectin was determined using an ELISA. Adiponectin concentrations were statistically significantly lower in women with GDM than controls (4.4 vs. 8.1 micro g/ml, P < 0.001). Approximately 73% of women with GDM, compared with 33% of controls, had adiponectin concentrations less than 6.4 micro g/ml. After adjusting for confounding, women with adiponectin concentrations less than 6.4 micro g/ml experienced a 4.6-fold increased risk of GDM, as compared with those with higher concentrations (95% confidence interval, 1.8-11.6). Our findings are consistent with other reports suggesting an association between hypoadiponectemia and risk of type 2 diabetes. Our findings extend the literature to include GDM. Studies designed to examine the effect of dietary and pharmacological mediators of adiponectin concentrations in pregnant and nonpregnant subjects are warranted.
