Individual differences exist in sensitivity to the psychotomimetic effect of cannabis; the molecular genetic basis underlying differential sensitivity remains elusive.
To investigate whether selected schizophrenia candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) moderate effects of cannabis use.
Interactions between recent cannabis use, determined by urinalysis results, and 152 SNPs in 42 candidate genes were examined in 740 unaffected siblings of 801 patients with psychosis to examine genetic moderation of the association between Structured Interview for Schizotypy-Revised positive schizotypy and recent cannabis use (at-risk paradigm). The SNPs showing Bonferroni-adjusted association in the at-risk paradigm were used in a case-only analysis in the 801 patients, as well as in a case-sibling and case-control analysis (using 419 controls) focusing on genetic moderation of developmental effects of cannabis on later psychotic disorder.
The Netherlands and Flanders, Belgium.
Eight hundred one patients with psychosis and their 740 unaffected siblings.
Significant interaction between any of the selected SNPs and cannabis in the at-risk paradigm, followed by selective case-only, case-sibling, and case-control analyses.
In the unaffected siblings, 16 SNPs in 12 genes showed significant interaction at P < .05, 3 of which survived correction for multiple testing (P < .0003), situated in AKT1 (rs2494732 and rs1130233) and LRRTM1 (rs673871). Follow-up analysis supported AKT1 rs2494732 × cannabis interaction in the case-only (β = 0.20; P = .007), case-sibling (interaction P = .040), and case-control (interaction P = .057) analyses, with individuals with C/C genotypes having an approximately 2-fold odds of being diagnosed with a psychotic disorder when having used cannabis. In the unaffected siblings, the AKT1 × cannabis interaction explained 2.2% additional variance in schizotypy in the whole sample and 19.0% additional variance in the exposed siblings with recent cannabis use.
Genetic variation in AKT1 may mediate both short-term as well as longer-term effects on psychosis expression associated with use of cannabis, possibly through a mechanism of cannabinoid-regulated AKT1/GSK-3 signaling downstream of the dopamine D(2) receptor.
Bilateral facial nerve palsy is an uncommon occurrence. We describe a case of bilateral facial nerve palsy secondary to a single cycle of high-dose paclitaxel therapy (825 mg/m2), in a woman with breast cancer. Prior to her high-dose therapy, she had a residual grade 2 peripheral neuropathy following treatment with ten cycles of standard-dose paclitaxel (total dose 3200 mg). The features of the peripheral neuropathy due to standard-dose paclitaxel, which can be both motor and sensory, are well described. Cumulative paclitaxel dose is considered a risk factor for development of the neuropathy. Although facial nerve palsy secondary to paclitaxel is not previously reported, other cranial nerve toxicity has been described. Consistent with reports of the reversibility of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy, the facial nerve palsies in our patient resolved over 23 months. Ongoing studies of high-dose paclitaxel warrant close attention to its cumulative neurotoxic effects, particularly in patients previously treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy.
We report the case of a 66-year-old male with ulcerative colitis diagnosed in 1987, who had been treated with azathioprine (AZA) for the past two years (average dose about 1.6 mg/kg/day). In May 1999 he presented with painless jaundice, fatigue and recent weight loss. Cholestatic enzymes were elevated, alpha-fetoprotein was normal and hepatitis B/C serology negative. After diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via biopsy, tumour resection was performed. The histology was typical for a well-differentiated HCC with trabecular and pseudoglandular structures. Neighbouring liver tissue was atrophic, with nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), peliosis-like sinusoidal ectasias and intra-sinusoidal accumulation of blood, associated with peri-sinusoidal fibrosis. Although none of the well-established risk factors for HCC such as cirrhosis, hepatitis B/C, metabolic liver disease or toxins were present, this patient developed HCC. This and previous reports suggest that NRH and/or VOD associated with AZA represent a risk factor for HCC. AZA should therefore not only be stopped in patients with NRH/VOD but patients should also be screened for HCC.
Neuropharmacological properties of tolperisone hydrochloride (2,4'-dimethyl-3-piperidinopropiophenone hydrochloride) were investigated in mice, rats and cats. Tolperisone inhibited the spontaneous movement and methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity in mice and the ED50 was approx. 50 mg/kg, s.c. At this dose, tolperisone did not prolong the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time. Tolperisone inhibited convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazol, nicotine and maximum electric shock, but did not affect convulsions induced by strychnine and picrotoxin. Tolperisone induced muscle relaxation in mice and rats in several pharmacological tests, but did not affect neuro-muscular transmission. Tolperisone did not affect conditioned avoidance response in rats and methamphetamine-induced rotational behaviour in nigro-lesioned rats. Tolperisone reduced decerebrated rigidity in cats with i.v. administration of 5 approximately 10 mg/kg and intraduodenal administration of 50 approximately 100 mg/kg. Tolperisone elicited a slight drowsy pattern in the spontaneous EEG of cats at 5 approximately 10 mg/kg, i.v., and inhibited the EEG arousal response and pressor response to stimulation of mesencephalic reticular formation or posterior hypothalamic area. These results suggest that inhibition of the activity in the gamma pathway descending from the mesencephalic reticular formation may be involved in the mechanism of muscle relaxant action of tolperisone.
The existence of a dose-response relation between nitrous oxide concentration and regional dysfunction in compromised myocardium, and whether or not halothane-induced myocardial depression alleviated this regional dysfunction was examined. Nitrous oxide was administered to eight dogs with experimentally induced left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) critical stenosis during fentanyl (100 micrograms/kg bolus plus 1.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) anesthesia. Two modes of nitrous oxide administration were employed: gradual (in steps of 20% inspired, i.e., 0%, 20%, 40%, and 60% inspired) and abrupt (0-60% inspired). Regional myocardial function was assessed by sonomicrometry. Regional dysfunction in the compromised myocardium, in the form of postsystolic shortening (PSS), increased above baseline levels during 40% (4.2 +/- 2.3% to 12.1 +/- 3.9%, P less than 0.05) and 60% (4.2 +/- 2.3% to 12.5 +/- 3.6%, P less than 0.05) inspired nitrous oxide (gradual administration) and also during abrupt 60% nitrous oxide administration (6.4 +/- 2.6% to 9.9 +/- 3.2%, P less than 0.05). After abrupt 60% inspired nitrous oxide administration, halothane (0.7% inspired) was introduced and caused decreases in mean arterial pressure (106.1 +/- 4.5 mm Hg to 76.2 +/- 5.5 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) and peak LV dP/dt (1700 +/- 150 mm Hg/sec to 1100 +/- 100 mm Hg/sec, P less than 0.05). Halothane caused a marked increase in PSS (9.9 +/- 3.2% to 30.8 +/- 12.6%, P less than 0.05). Thus nitrous oxide administration caused regional dysfunction in myocardium supplied by a critically narrowed LAD whether administered gradually or abruptly and at concentrations as low as 40% inspired.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The effect of diphenyl diselenide, (PhSe)2, administration on 2-nitropropane (2-NP)-induced hepatic damage was examined in male rats. Rats were pre-treated with a single dose of diphenyl diselenide (10, 50 or 100 micromol/kg). Afterward, they received only one dose of 2-NP (100 mg/kg body weight dissolved in olive oil). The parameters that indicate tissue damage such as plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), creatinine and urea were determined. Since toxicity induced by 2-NP is related to oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation was also evaluated. Diphenyl diselenide (100 micromol/kg) significantly reduced plasma ALT, gamma-GGT, AFP levels when compared to 2-NP group. Treatment with diphenyl diselenide, at all doses, effectively protects the increase of lipid peroxidation when compared to 2-NP group. Histological examination revealed that 2-NP treatment causes a moderate swelling and degenerative alterations on hepatocytes and diphenyl diselenide (100 micromol/kg) protects against these alterations. Diphenyl diselenide (50 and 100 micromol/kg) significantly decreased the urea level. This study evidences the protective effect of diphenyl diselenide by 2-NP-induced acute hepatic damage.
Long-term treatment with the dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA) induces dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We divided hemiparkinsonian rats treated chronically with L-DOPA into two groups: one showed motor improvement without dyskinesia, and the other developed debilitating dyskinesias in response to the treatment. We then compared the plasticity of corticostriatal synapses between the two groups. High-frequency stimulation of cortical afferents induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of corticostriatal synapses in both groups of animals. Control and non-dyskinetic rats showed synaptic depotentiation in response to subsequent low-frequency synaptic stimulation, but dyskinetic rats did not. The depotentiation seen in both L-DOPA-treated non-dyskinetic rats and intact controls was prevented by activation of the D1 subclass of dopamine receptors or inhibition of protein phosphatases. The striata of dyskinetic rats contained abnormally high levels of phospho[Thr34]-DARPP-32, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1. These results indicate that abnormal information storage in corticostriatal synapses is linked with the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.
We report the case of a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who, during chemotherapy according to the r-CHOP schedule (rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine and prednisone), showed a hepatic flare with jaundice. Given the patient's state of asymptomatic carrier of HBsAg, we began a treatment of telbivudine (600 mg/die), resulting in a regression of hepatitis flare and negativization of HBV viraemia.
mRNA and protein presence of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) 1 (NHE1) and 5 (NHE5) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and dorsal spinal cord as well as its possible role in three inflammatory nociception tests were determined. Local peripheral ipsilateral, but not contralateral, administration of NHE inhibitors 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride hydrochloride (DMA, 0.3-30 microM/paw), 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA, 0.3-30 microM/paw) and amiloride (0.1-10 microM/paw) significantly increased flinching but not licking behavior in the capsaicin and 5-HT tests. Moreover, DMA and EIPA (0.03-30 microM/paw) as well as amiloride (0.1-1 microM/paw) augmented, in a dose-dependent manner, 0.5% formalin-induced flinching behavior during phase II but not during phase I. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed the expression of NHE1 and NHE5 in DRG and dorsal spinal cord. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of NHE1 in DRG and spinal cord. Moreover, NHE5 was expressed in dorsal spinal cord, but not in DRG where a 45 kDa truncated isoform of NHE5 was identified. Collectively, these data suggest that NHE1, but not NHE5, plays an important role reducing inflammatory pain in rats.
We report a case of fosinopril-induced prolonged cholestatic jaundice and pruritus in a 61-year-old man, with no previous hepatobiliary disease, who presented with asthenia, jaundice and itching 3 weeks after starting fosinopril therapy. Other drugs taken by the patient were not considered probable causes. The diagnostic evaluation showed no biliary obstruction and other possible causes of intra-hepatic cholestasis were excluded. Liver biopsy showed cholestasis without bile duct damage. The disease ran a severe course during the 2 months of hospitalization, with prolonged itching for 6 months, eventually controlled with oral naltrexone. Jaundice subsided after 4 months, with anicteric cholestasis persisting for more than 18 months. Similar occurrences have been reported with other inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (mostly captopril), but this is the first case of an important adverse reaction to fosinopril.
Under short duration hypercalcemia induced by pharmacological doses of vitamin D3 significant ultrastructural changes were observed in the renomedullary interstitial cells of rats. The most striking alteration was the degranulation of these cells accompanied with the increase in volume of the rough and smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, enlargement of the Golgi apparatus and occurence of osmiophilic inclusions probably of lipid nature in mitochondria. The ultrastructural changes can be regarded as an expression of the increase of a synthetic and secretory activity of the renomedullary interstitial cells and they may be associated with an enhanced production of prostaglandins or other lipid hormonal substances than prostaglandins under condition of hypercalcemia.
Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) refers to the rapid development of severe acute liver injury with impaired synthetic function and encephalopathy in a person who previously had a normal liver or had wellcompensated liver disease. The potential causes of FHF are numerous, but viral or toxin-induced hepatitis are the most common. Clozapineinduced hepatotoxicity has rarely been reported in the literature, occurs via an unknown mechanism and results in liver biochemical abnormalities that are usually of no clinical significance. In approximately 30% to 50% of patients treated with clozapine, there is an asymptomatic rise in serum aminotransaminase levels; however, there are no current guidelines for routine monitoring of liver function tests and liver enzymes during its use. Fatal fulminant hepatitis has only been reported in three patients receiving clozapine. A case of fatal FHF that occurred in a schizophrenic woman who began clozapine therapy shortly before her illness developed is described.
Portal hypertension with varices developed in 18/675 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in a randomized trial comparing busulphan with busulphan and thioguanine. All 18 had received the drug combination and none busulphan alone (P less than 0.0001). Ascites was also seen significantly more often in the combination arm (P less than 0.05). These results strongly suggest that the addition of thioguanine was responsible for the development of portal hypertension. The histological features were predominantly those of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension--either idiopathic portal hypertension with minimal morphological abnormalities, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or in two cases leukaemic infiltration only was noted. Cirrhosis was present in 3/16 cases studied. Both treatment groups developed abnormal liver function tests during the chronic phase, but particularly with progression of the disease. During chronic phase abnormalities were significantly more frequent in those receiving busulphan and thioguanine-alkaline phosphatase (P less than 0.02), transaminases (P less than 0.04), bilirubin (P less than 0.05), multiple abnormalities (P less than 0.01). The development of portal hypertension was often associated with abnormalities of these tests; however, lack of specificity precludes their use as a predictor of subsequent clinical problems. Thioguanine confers no survival advantage in this disease. In view of its hepatotoxicity it should not be used routinely for maintenance of control in chronic phase CML.
Ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamates (EBDC) (maneb, mancozeb,...) are fungicides which rarely cause acute toxicity reactions, but may have a severe long-term toxic effect. Twelve cases reported to the Bordeaux Anti-Poison Center over a 10-year period generally exhibited short-term neurological symptoms of variable severity. Cases of acute intoxication reported in the literature have involved various neurological signs including headache, dizziness and confusion, and a few cases of seizures, all of which were rapidly reversible. Long-term exposure has been associated with parkinsonism and epidemiological studies have found an increased risk of neurocognitive impairment associated with long-term exposure to pesticides in general and to EBDC specifically. Experimentally, EBDC increases the neurotoxicity of MPTP and paraquat. Their metabolite, ethylene thiourea (ETU), is neurotoxic in utero. There are indications that EBDC and/or ETU may increase sensitivity to genetic and environmental risk factors for cell death and apoptosis. Occupational or accidental exposure to EBDC and its possible long-term consequences require adequate studies concerning their mechanism, surveillance and prevention.
Because only a small fraction of asbestos-exposed individuals develop malignant mesothelioma, and because mesothelioma clustering is observed in some families, we searched for genetic predisposing factors. We discovered germline mutations in the gene encoding BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) in two families with a high incidence of mesothelioma, and we observed somatic alterations affecting BAP1 in familial mesotheliomas, indicating biallelic inactivation. In addition to mesothelioma, some BAP1 mutation carriers developed uveal melanoma. We also found germline BAP1 mutations in 2 of 26 sporadic mesotheliomas; both individuals with mutant BAP1 were previously diagnosed with uveal melanoma. We also observed somatic truncating BAP1 mutations and aberrant BAP1 expression in sporadic mesotheliomas without germline mutations. These results identify a BAP1-related cancer syndrome that is characterized by mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. We hypothesize that other cancers may also be involved and that mesothelioma predominates upon asbestos exposure. These findings will help to identify individuals at high risk of mesothelioma who could be targeted for early intervention.
Phosphorylation of tyrosine residue in proteins is an important modulatory process for membrane transduction and cell signaling and for several cellular functions. The concentration and distribution of phosphotyrosine proteins were analyzed in the hippocampi of rats in the model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The concentration of several phosphotyrosine proteins increased during status epilepticus. During the seizure-free period and the chronic period of this epilepsy model, the hippocampi of rats did not exhibit changes in the expression of these proteins. Immunohistochemistry showed an increased immunoreactivity throughout the hippocampal formation of rats 1 h after status epilepticus that was acutely induced by pilocarpine. Animals killed after 3 h of status epilepticus showed an increased expression of phosphotyrosine in the hippocampal hilus and CA3 regions. After 5 h of status epilepticus, phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity persisted only in the CA3 region. After 12 h of status epilepticus, the hippocampal formation exhibited a normal phosphotyrosine immunostaining, showing that the increased expression of these proteins is related to the acute phase and that several intracellular events could undergo modifications during the status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine.
We carried out a genome-wide association study of type-2 diabetes (T2D) in individuals of South Asian ancestry. Our discovery set included 5,561 individuals with T2D (cases) and 14,458 controls drawn from studies in London, Pakistan and Singapore. We identified 20 independent SNPs associated with T2D at P < 10(-4) for testing in a replication sample of 13,170 cases and 25,398 controls, also all of South Asian ancestry. In the combined analysis, we identified common genetic variants at six loci (GRB14, ST6GAL1, VPS26A, HMG20A, AP3S2 and HNF4A) newly associated with T2D (P = 4.1 × 10(-8) to P = 1.9 × 10(-11)). SNPs at GRB14 were also associated with insulin sensitivity (P = 5.0 × 10(-4)), and SNPs at ST6GAL1 and HNF4A were also associated with pancreatic beta-cell function (P = 0.02 and P = 0.001, respectively). Our findings provide additional insight into mechanisms underlying T2D and show the potential for new discovery from genetic association studies in South Asians, a population with increased susceptibility to T2D.
In a review of the records of 81 patients with the discharge diagnosis of digitalis toxicity, I found a preponderance of very old patients, many of whom had anorexia, nausea, and prerenal azotemia. Arrhythmias were common (93%) and reflected enhanced automaticity, enhanced AV block, or both. Atrial fibrillation with complete heart block and a regular junctional rhythm should particularly elicit suspicion of digitalis toxicity. Atrial tachycardia with block is less specific and less frequent.
To investigate whether the lung injury induced by precordial compression without ventilation or not, in the cardiac-arrest animal model with central apnea. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with halothane. The cardiac arrest was induced by 100 mg/kg ketamine (IV) and accompanied with central apnea. They were allocated to four groups by means of resuscitation. Group A was treated with only precordial compression without the other treatments. In group B with tracheotomy and precordial compression. In group C was performed tracheotomy, oxygenation, and precordial compression. The animals in group D were treated with tracheotomy, oxygen administration, artificial ventilation, and precordial compression. Four minutes after cardiac arrest, the resuscitation was started and continued for 20 min. PaCO(2) in the group without mechanical ventilation increased significantly after the start of the resuscitation. All animals were sacrificed after resuscitation procedure. The wet/dry weight ratio of lung in group A (6.9+/-0.8) was significantly higher than that of the other groups B, C and D (5.9+/-0.6, 5.7+/-0.4 and 5.6+/-0.4, P<0.05 in each). The pathological findings also demonstrated the lung injuries, such as edema, migration, and destruction of structure in group A. The precordial compression alone did not improve CO(2) elimination in the gasping-less cardiac arrest model, as well as maybe inducing more severe lung injury than that with the protective management. This experimental model raises the possibility that chest compressions without airway management might result in lung injury.
Common acquired melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms that are composed of small, uniform melanocytes and are typically present as flat or slightly elevated pigmented lesions on the skin. We describe two families with a new autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple, skin-colored, elevated melanocytic tumors. In contrast to common acquired nevi, the melanocytic neoplasms in affected family members ranged histopathologically from epithelioid nevi to atypical melanocytic proliferations that showed overlapping features with melanoma. Some affected individuals developed uveal or cutaneous melanomas. Segregating with this phenotype, we found inactivating germline mutations of BAP1, which encodes a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase. The majority of melanocytic neoplasms lost the remaining wild-type allele of BAP1 by various somatic alterations. In addition, we found BAP1 mutations in a subset of sporadic melanocytic neoplasms showing histological similarities to the familial tumors. These findings suggest that loss of BAP1 is associated with a clinically and morphologically distinct type of melanocytic neoplasm.
The incidence of seizures after unintentional bupropion ingestion in children aged < 6 years has been reported as 0.2%. However, in many poison centers, > 80% of these patients are referred to the Emergency Department (ED) for evaluation.
To evaluate if all unintentional pediatric bupropion ingestions require referral to a health care facility (HCF), or what fraction of these could be managed safely at home.
A retrospective chart review was conducted of all bupropion ingestions in children aged < 6 years for 2000-2006 from four regional poison centers. Exclusion criteria were lack of follow-up or multiple drug ingestion.
Of 407 patients, 209 (51%) were male. Mean age was 2.2 years (SD +/- 1.0). There were 329 patients (81%) seen in a HCF, of which 143 (35%) were hospitalized; 77 patients (19%) were observed at home. Symptoms occurred in 73 patients (18%): sinus tachycardia (n = 50), nausea/vomiting (n = 32), hyperactivity (n = 17), seizure (n = 3), hallucinations (n = 2), and hypertension (n = 2). The mean heart rate of patients with sinus tachycardia (n = 50, 12.3%) was 137 beats/min (SD +/- 13), with a range of 112-172 beats/min. Mean dosage of those with tachycardia was 24 mg/kg. In the 2 patients with hypertension, the maximum recorded blood pressures were 145/80 mm Hg (2-year-old boy) and 137/90 mm Hg (2-year-old girl), with heart rates of 122 and 125 beats/min, respectively. Dose ingested and patient weight was known for 218 patients. Mean dosage ingested was 12.2 mg/kg, with a range of 2.6-64 mg/kg. Eighty-eight percent of patients with a known dosage ingested < 20 mg/kg.
A high percentage of children continue to be seen in a HCF. Concern from the higher incidence of severe effects seen with intentional adult exposures may be one of the reasons for this cautious approach.
Unintentional pediatric bupropion ingestions resulted in clinical effects that rarely required any HCF intervention. Isolated unintentional bupropion ingestion of <or= 10 mg/kg may not require referral to a health care facility.
To determine the role of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) in protecting the lung from aerosolized nickel injury, transgenic mouse lines expressing human TGF-alpha in the pulmonary epithelium, under control of the human surfactant protein-C gene promoter, were tested. Higher expressing TGF-alpha transgenic mouse lines, expressing distinct levels of TGF-alpha, survived longer than nontransgenic control mice. Increased survival correlated with levels of TGF-alpha expression in the lung. After 72 h of nickel exposure (70 microg Ni/m3), transgenic lines with intermediate levels of the TGF-alpha expression demonstrated attenuation of lung injury. The highest expressing line (line 28) demonstrated reduced lung inflammation and edema, reduced lung wet-to-dry weight ratios, decreased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein and neutrophils, reduced interleukin (IL)-1beta, interleukin-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and maintained surfactant protein-B (SP-B) levels compared with nontransgenic controls. In the TGF-alpha transgenic mouse model, TGF-alpha protects against nickel-induced acute lung injury, at least in part, by attenuating the inflammatory response, reducing pulmonary edema, and preserving levels of SP-B.
(1) Three cholinesterase inhibitors are marketed in France for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine. Tremor and dystonia are known adverse effects of cholinesterase inhibitors. (2) In patients with Parkinson's disease who have cognitive disorders, or in patients with Lewy body dementia, exacerbations of parkinsonism and tremor have been observed during treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors at normal doses. The disorders were reversible on withdrawal of the cholinesterase inhibitor. (3) Withdrawal of cholinesterase inhibitors should be considered if gait disorders, falls or parkinsonism occur or worsen during treatment.
