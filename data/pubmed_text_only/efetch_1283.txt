The basic pharmacology of the third-generation beta-blocking agent carvedilol differs considerably from second-generation compounds such as metoprolol. Moreover, carvedilol may produce different, ie, more favorable, clinical effects in chronic heart failure. For these reasons, we compared the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on adrenergic activity, receptor expression, degree of clinical beta-blockade, hemodynamics, and left ventricular function in patients with mild or moderate chronic heart failure.
The effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol were compared in two concurrent placebo-controlled trials with carvedilol or metoprolol that had common substudies focused on adrenergic, hemodynamic, and left ventricular functional measurements. All subjects in the substudies had chronic heart failure resulting from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Carvedilol at 50 to 100 mg/d produced reductions in exercise heart rate that were similar to metoprolol at 125 to 150 mg/d, indicating comparable degrees of beta-blockade. Compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was associated with greater improvement in New York Heart Association functional class. Although there were no significant differences in hemodynamic effects between the carvedilol and metoprolol active-treatment groups, carvedilol tended to produce relatively greater improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, and stroke work compared with changes in the respective placebo groups. Carvedilol selectively lowered coronary sinus norepinephrine levels, an index of cardiac adrenergic activity, whereas metoprolol did not lower coronary sinus norepinephrine and actually increased central venous norepinephrine levels. Finally, metoprolol was associated with an increase in cardiac beta-receptor density, whereas carvedilol did not change cardiac beta-receptor expression.
The third-generation beta-blocking agent carvedilol has substantially different effects on left ventricular function, hemodynamics, adrenergic activity, and beta-receptor expression than dose the second-generation compound metoprolol. Some or all of these differences may explain the apparent differences in clinical results between the two compounds.
Benzonaphthofurandione has been considered as an important class of naturally occurring and synthetic compounds having a variety of biological functions. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor effects of 3-[2-(dimethylamino)isopropoxy]-1-hydroxybenzo[b]naphtho[2,3-d]furan-6,11-dione (8e), a novel benzonaphthofurandione derivative, on the growth of colorectal cancer HCT 116 cells both in vitro culture and an in vivo animal model. Compound 8e exhibited the potential growth inhibition of the colon cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The anti-proliferative activity of 8e was also associated with the induction of cell cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. The 8e-induced cell cycle arrest was well correlated with the suppression of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4, cyclin D1, cyclin E, c-Myc, and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb). The tumor growth in xenograft nude mice bearing HCT 116 cells by compound 8e (10mg/kg) also significantly inhibited without any overt toxicity. In addition, the down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Akt, and mTOR signalings were associated with the anti-proliferative activity of compound 8e in colon cancer cells. Taken together, these findings suggested that cell cycle arrest and modulation of cell signal transduction pathways might be the plausible mechanisms of actions for the anti-proliferative activity of 8e, and thus 8e might be used as an effective chemotherapeutic agent in human colon cancer.
This study was conducted to investigate the beneficial role of naringin on nickel induced nephrotoxicity. Nickel (Ni) (20mg/kg body weight (b.w.) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 20 days. Naringin was administered orally (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg b.w.) with i.p. administration of Ni. Ni administration increased the levels of serum urea, uric acid and creatinine with a significant decrease in creatinine clearance and decreased levels of urea, uric acid and creatinine in urine. The levels of lipid peroxidation markers and nickel concentration in blood and kidney were also increased. While, the activities of enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants were decreased. Treatment with naringin attenuated the alterations in the renal and urine markers, decreasing lipid peroxidation markers, increasing the antioxidant cascade and decreasing the nickel concentration in blood and kidney. All these changes were supported by histopathological observations. These findings demonstrate that naringin exerts a protective effect against nickel toxicity.
To establish whether there is an association between the ingestion of synthetic food colorings and behavioral change in children referred for assessment of "hyperactivity."
From approximately 800 children referred to the Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne) for assessment of suspected hyperactivity, 200 were included in a 6-week open trial of a diet free of synthetic food coloring. The parents of 150 children reported behavioral improvement with the diet, and deterioration on the introduction of foods noted to contain synthetic coloring. A 30-item behavioral rating inventory was devised from an examination of the clinical histories of 50 suspected reactors. Thirty-four other children (23 suspected reactors, 11 uncertain reactors) and 20 control subjects, aged 2 to 14 years, were studied.
A 21-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeated-measures study used each child as his or her own control. Placebo, or one of six dose levels of tartrazine (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 mg), was administered randomly each morning, and behavioral ratings were recorded by parents at the end of each 24 hours.
The study identified 24 children as clear reactors (19 of 23 "suspected reactors," 3 of 11 "uncertain reactors," and 2 of 20 "control subjects"). They were irritable and restless and had sleep disturbance. Significant reactions were observed at all six dose levels. A dose response effect was obtained. With a dose increase greater than 10 mg, the duration of effect was prolonged.
Behavioral changes in irritability, restlessness, and sleep disturbance are associated with the ingestion of tartrazine in some children. A dose response effect was observed.
Copper serves as an essential cofactor for a variety of proteins in all living organisms. Previously, we described a human gene (CTR1;SLC31A1) that encodes a high-affinity copper-uptake protein and hypothesized that this protein is required for copper delivery to mammalian cells. Here, we test this hypothesis by inactivating the Ctr1 gene in mice by targeted mutagenesis. We observe early embryonic lethality in homozygous mutant embryos and a deficiency in copper uptake in the brains of heterozygous animals. Ctr1(-/-) embryos can be recovered at E8.5 but are severely developmentally retarded and morphologically abnormal. Histological analysis reveals discontinuities and variable thickness in the basement membrane of the embryonic region and an imperfect Reichert's membrane, features that are likely due to lack of activity in the collagen cross-linking cupro-enzyme lysyl oxidase. A collapsed embryonic cavity, the absence of an allantois, retarded mesodermal migration, and increased cell death are also apparent. In the brains of heterozygous adult mice, which at 16 months are phenotypically normal, copper is reduced to approximately half compared with control littermates, implicating CTR1 as the required port for copper entry into at least this organ. A study of the spatial and temporal expression pattern of Ctr1 during mouse development and adulthood further shows that CTR1 is ubiquitously transcribed with highest expression observed in the specialized epithelia of the choroid plexus and renal tubules and in connective tissues of the eye, ovary, and testes. We conclude that CTR1 is the primary avenue for copper uptake in mammalian cells.
Over a five-year period 100 cadaveric renal transplants were performed. In 91 of these recipients, a prophylactic parenteral antibiotic (cefoperazone) was administered and closed wound drainage was used. Of these 91 patients, 33 received azathioprine/prednisone immunosuppression, whereas cyclosporine/prednisone with or without azathioprine was used in the remaining 58. The incidence of wound infections was significantly reduced from 12 per cent (4/33) in the azathioprine group to 1.7 per cent (1/58) in the cyclosporine group (p less than 0.01). When conventional immunosuppression (azathioprine/prednisone) is employed in renal transplantation, triple antibiotic prophylaxis that includes an aminoglycoside is most effective in preventing wound infections. A single non-nephrotoxic antibiotic, cefoperazone, offers similar protection in the cyclosporine/prednisone-treated renal transplant recipient.
The carcinogenicities of 1-nitropyrene and 1,3-, 1,6- and 1,8-dinitropyrene were assessed in weanling female CD rats. The animals were administered one of the compounds at 10 mumol/kg body wt through intraperitoneal or intragastric administration three times a week for 4 weeks. The total cumulative dose averaged 16 mumol/animal. The experiment was ended 78 weeks following the first administration. The average survival period for the animals in the 1,6- and 1,8-dinitropyrene i.p. treated groups, due to the occurrence of life-threatening peritoneal malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs) in nearly all of the animals, were 19 and 38 weeks respectively. 1,3-Dinitropyrene induced only a few MFHs. 1,8-Dinitropyrene also induced a significant incidence of leukemia. A significant increase of the incidence of mammary tumors was observed in the groups of rats treated i.p. with 1-nitropyrene, or 1,3- or 1,8-dinitropyrene, and those treated i.g. with 1,8-dinitropyrene. These results demonstrate that nitropyrenes are capable of inducing MFH, mammary tumors and leukemia in the rat.
The present study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effect of thymoquinone (TQ), the main constituent of the volatile oil from Nigella sativa seeds, in rats after chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis with N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl esters (l-NAME). Rats were divided randomly into different treatment groups: control, l-NAME, TQ and l-NAME + TQ. Hypertension was induced by 4 weeks administration of l-NAME (50 mg/kg/day p.o.). TQ was administered alone or in combination with l-NAME and continued for 4 weeks. The animals were killed, and the serum and kidney tissues were isolated for the determination of creatinine and glutathione (GSH), respectively. Rats receiving l-NAME showed a progressive increase in systolic blood pressure compared with control rats. Concomitant treatment with TQ (0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day p.o.) reduced the increase in systolic blood pressure induced by l-NAME in a dose dependent manner. Kidney injury was demonstrated by a significant increase in serum creatinine and a decrease in GSH in kidney tissue from l-NAME treated rats. Treatment of rats with TQ decreased the elevated creatinine and increased GSH to normal levels. TQ inhibited the in vitro production of superoxide radical in enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems. In conclusion, TQ is effective in protecting rats against l-NAME-induced hypertension and renal damage possibly via antioxidant activity.
A haloperidol-treated patient with chronic schizophrenia had a near-arrhythmic circadian rest-activity cycle, whereas rhythms of 6-sulphatoxy-melatonin and core body temperature were of normal amplitude and phase-advanced. Sleep electroencephalography measured throughout a 31-h 'constant-bedrest' protocol revealed a phase-delayed sleep-wake propensity cycle, low sleep continuity (ultradian 'bouts'), and very little slow-wave sleep and slow-wave activity (0.75-4.5 Hz). Switching treatment to the atypical neuroleptic clozapine improved both the circadian organization of the rest-activity cycle and the patient's clinical state. This observation can be conceptualized in terms of the two-process model of sleep regulation. High-dose haloperidol treatment may have lowered the circadian alertness threshold, whereas clozapine augmented circadian amplitude (perhaps through its high affinity to dopamine D4 and serotonin 5HT7 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nuclei). Measurement of the circadian rest-activity cycle may be a useful non-invasive method to follow functional consequences of neuroleptic treatment.
In the high-dose benzylpenicillin treatment of subacute bacterial endocarditis leucopenia can develop in rare cases. Often it is paralleled by anemia, sometimes also by a decrease in the number of platelets. Myalgia, gastric discomfort, or a sore threat deserve interest as premonitory symptoms. In every case this treatment inevitably needs through hematologic control.
Retinoids are synthetic vitamin A derivatives, particularly used in dermatology. Their prescription in women of childbearing age can cause, if pregnancy occurs, a serious malformative embryopathy, mainly involving external ear, brain and heart. A neonatal case caused by isotretinoin (RoAccutane) emphasizes the clinical and epidemiological data concerning this embryopathy. The aetiopathological hypothesis of an interaction between isotretinoin and Hox genes is advanced. Prophylactic measures are difficult since neonatal reported cases are uncommon, but antenatal exposition to this strong teratogenic agent results in multiple spontaneous abortions or pregnancy interruptions.
The relationship between erectile dysfunction and sulpiride stimulatory effect on prolactin secretion was studied in 13 married male psychiatric outpatients. The patients population was comprised of 2 groups: patients with anxiety disorders resistant to minor tranquilizers who were treated with sulpiride up to 200 mg/day, and schizophrenic patients treated with sulpiride 600 mg/day. All the patients were maintained on maximal dose for a period of 3 weeks. Sexual function and blood prolactin levels were monitored once weekly. The patients who developed impotence were maintained on higher doses of sulpiride and exhibited higher prolactin levels in comparison to the potent patients. Restoration of potency was observed after reduction or discontinuation of sulpiride treatment. It is concluded that sulpiride induced impotence is associated with hyperprolactinemia.
The purpose of this study was to assess whether troglitazone (TRO) would induce cellular acidosis by inhibiting Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) 1 in breast carcinoma-derived cell lines and, if so, whether cellular acidosis would be associated with a reduction in proliferation.
Intracellular pH (pH(i)) and acid extrusion capacity after an exogenous acid load were assayed using (2, 7)-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with TRO. Radiolabeled thymidine incorporation was used to assess DNA synthesis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma involvement was assessed using an antagonist and PPARgamma(-/-) NIH3T3 cells.
TRO induced a prompt (<4 minute) and severe cellular acidosis in both MCF-7 (7.54 +/- 0.23 to 6.77 +/- 0.06; P < 0.001) and MDA-MB-231 cells (7.38 +/- 0.18 to 6.89 +/- 0.25; P < 0.05) after 12 minutes, without increasing acid production. Acid extrusion as assessed by the response to an exogenous acid load (NH(4)Cl pulse) was markedly blunted (MDA-MB-231, P < 0.01) or eliminated (MCF-7, P < 0.001). Chronic exposure to TRO resulted in NHE1 activity reduction (P < 0.05) and a dose-dependent decrease in DNA synthesis (<75% inhibition at 100 micromol/L; P < 0.001 and P < 0.01 for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, respectively) associated with a decreased number of viable cells. TRO-mediated inhibition of proliferation was not reversed by the presence of the PPARgamma inhibitor GW9662 and was demonstrable in PPARgamma(-/-) NIH3T3 cells, consistent with a PPARgamma-independent mechanism.
TRO induces marked cellular acidosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231 cells. Sustained acidosis is consonant with decreased proliferation and growth that is not reversed by a PPARgamma antagonist. Our results support a NHE-mediated action of TRO that exerts its effect independent of PPARgamma.
To explore the possible mechanisms of curcumin in rat colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic (TNBS) acid.
Rats with TNBS acid-induced colitis were treated with curcumin (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg per day ip). Changes of body weight and histological scores as well as survival rate were evaluated. Leukocyte infiltration was detected by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Inflammation cytokines were determined by RT-PCR. Local concentration of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in colon mucosa was determined by ELISA.
Curcumin improved survival rate and histological image, decreased the macroscopic scores and MPO activity. Also curcumin reduced the expression of COX-2 and inflammation cytokines. In addition, treatment with curcumin increased the PGE(2) level.
Curcumin has therapeutic effects on TNBS acid-induced colitis, the mechanisms seem to be related to COX-2 inhibition and PGE(2) improvement.
To assess the defensive nature of Sargassum polycystum (S. polycystum) (Brown alga) against acetaminophen (AAP)-induced changes in drug metabolizing microsomal enzyme system, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and fine structural features of the liver during toxic hepatitis in rats.
Male albino Wistar strain rats used for the study were randomly categorized into 4 groups. Group I consisted of normal control rats fed with standard diet. Group II rats were administered with acetaminophen (800 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally). Group III rats were pre-treated with S. polycystum extract alone. Group IV rats were orally pre-treated with S. polycystum extract (200 mg/kg body weight for 21 d) prior to acetaminophen induction (800 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally). Serum separated and liver was excised and microsomal fraction was isolated for assaying cytochrome P450, NADPH Cyt P450 reductase and b(5). Serum TNF-alpha was detected using ELISA. Fine structural features of liver were examined by transmission electron microscopy.
Rats intoxicated with acetaminophen showed considerable impairment in the activities of drug metabolizing microsomal enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, NADPH Cyt P450 reductase and b(5) when compared with the control rats. The rats intoxicated with acetaminophen also significantly triggered serum TNF-alpha when compared with the control rats. These severe alterations in the drug metabolizing enzymes were appreciably prevented in the rats pretreated with S. polycystum. The rats pretreated with S. polycystum showed considerable inhibition in the elevation of TNF-alpha compared to the rats intoxicated with acetaminophen. The electron microscopic observation showed considerable loss of structural integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid infiltration and ballooning of mitochondria in the acetaminophen-intoxicated rats, whereas the rats treated with S. polycystum showed considerable protection against acetaminophen-induced alterations in structural integrity.
These observations suggest that the animals treated with S. polycystum extract may have the ability to protect the drug metabolizing enzyme system and mitochondrial functional status from free radical attack, thereby showing its defense mechanism in protecting hepatic cells from acetaminophen toxic metabolite N-acetyl-para-benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI).
8-Methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide (capsaicin) was locally applied in the tail of rhesus monkeys to evoke a nociceptive response, thermal allodynia, which was manifested as reduced tail-withdrawal latencies in normally innocuous 46 degrees C water. Coadministration of three kappa opioid ligands, U50,488 (3.2-100 microgram), bremazocine (0.1-3.2 microgram), and dynorphin A(1-13) (3.2-100 microgram), with capsaicin in the tail dose-dependently inhibited capsaicin-induced allodynia. This local antinociception was antagonized by a small dose of an opioid antagonist, quadazocine; (0.32 mg), applied in the tail; however, this dose of quadazocine injected s.c. in the back did not antagonize local U50,488. Comparing the relative potency of either agonist or antagonist after local and systemic administration confirmed that the site of action of locally applied kappa opioid agonists is in the tail. In addition, local nor-binaltorphimine (0.32 mg) and oxilorphan (0.1-10 microgram) antagonist studies raised the possibility of kappa opioid receptor subtypes in the periphery, which indicated that U50,488 produced local antinociception by acting on kappa1 receptors, but bremazocine acted probably on non-kappa1 receptors. These results provide functional evidence that activation of peripheral kappa opioid receptors can diminish capsaicin-induced allodynia in primates. This experimental pain model is a useful tool for evaluating peripherally antinociceptive actions of kappa agonists without central side effects and suggests new approaches for opioid pain management.
Although ATP and P2X receptor activity have been lately associated with epilepsy, little is known regarding their exact roles in epileptogenesis. Temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) in rat was induced by pilocarpine in order to study changes of hippocampal P2X(2), P2X(4) and P2X(7) receptor expression during acute, latent or chronic phases of epilepsy. During acute and chronic phases increased P2X(7) receptor expression was principally observed in glial cells and glutamatergic nerve terminals, suggesting participation of this receptor in the activation of inflammatory and excitotoxic processes during epileptogenesis. No significant alterations of hippocampal P2X(2) and P2X(4) receptor expression was noted during the acute or latent phase when compared to the control group, indicating that these receptors are not directly involved with the initiation of epilepsy. However, the reduction of hippocampal P2X(4) receptor immunostaining in the chronic phase could reflect neuronal loss or decreased GABAergic signaling.
Tests were made for interactions between antipsychotic drugs and compounds that enhance synaptic currents mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid-type glutamate receptors ("ampakines"). Typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs decreased methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats; the effects of near or even subthreshold doses of the antipsychotics were greatly enhanced by the ampakines. Interactions between the ampakine CX516 and low doses of different antipsychotics were generally additive and often synergistic. The ampakine did not exacerbate neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, indicating that the interaction between the different pharmacological classes was selective. These results suggest that positive modulators of cortical glutamatergic systems may be useful adjuncts in treating schizophrenia.
To determine the inhibitory effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) on cell growth, cell cycle and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the human gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 in vitro.
Human gastric cancer BGC-823 cells were treated with various concentrations of ATRA and the cell growth was then determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide viability assay. The cell cycle distribution was analyzed using a flow cytometer. The VEGF mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.
ATRA at concentrations of 0.1-10 micromol/L inhibited the growth of BGC-823 cells grown in culture; a time- and dose-dependent inhibitory influence was found. ATRA arrested BGC-823 cells at the G0/G1 phase in a dose-dependent way. Both VEGF mRNA and protein were decreased by ATRA in a dose-dependent way.
The anti-tumor effects of ATRA on human gastric cancer cells are associated with G0/G1 phase arrest and decreased VEGF expression.
Neuronal degeneration was detected in the tenia tecta and other regions of the anterior limbic system of male weanling rats 3 days after four doses of 5 mg/kg d-amphetamine (4 x 5 mg/kg AMPH) when seizures occurred during AMPH exposure. Neurodegeneration in the parietal cortex, loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and decreases in CPu tissue dopamine levels in weanlings was much less than those previously observed in adults. The neurotoxicity seen in the parietal cortex and CPu of the weanlings was much less than previously seen in adults even though severe hyperthermia and the behavior of retrograde propulsion occurred during AMPH exposure. Neurodegeneration was not detected in any of the previously mentioned brain regions in controls and weanlings made hyperthermic by a warm environment. However, signs of spontaneous neurodegeneration were seen in the posterior piriform cortex (Pir), posteriolateral cortical amygdaloid nucleus (PLCo), and the amygdalopiriform transition area (APir) of control weanlings. The doses of AMPH and the degree of hyperthermia necessary to induce seizures were substantially lower in weanlings compared to those previously observed in adult rats. Further studies will be necessary to determine if the susceptibility of weanlings to AMPH-induced seizures is related to or dependent on the same processes involved in producing degeneration in the posterior limbic system of saline controls.
A 64-year-old woman with long-standing bipolar illness was treated with carbamazepine and clonazepam with minimal success. Discontinuation of carbamazepine and clonazepam was followed by episodic amnesia, purposeless behavior, déjà vu, and confusion. Although her EEG was normal, the episodes were compatible with complex partial seizures and ceased after carbamazepine and clonazepam were reinstituted. This case raises the question of whether discontinuing carbamazepine and clonazepam can induce complex partial seizures in bipolar patients.
A mouse mutant expressing a bilateral nuclear and radial cataract was found after paternal treatment with chlorambucil. The purpose of this study was to establish the linkage of the mutation to a particular chromosome to allow molecular characterization. Moreover, the mutants were examined morphologically.
Isolated lenses were photographed and histologic sections of the eye were analyzed according to standard procedures. The mutation was localized to chromosome 1 by allelism testing with the Cryge(nz) mutation. Candidate genes were amplified by PCR from cDNA or genomic DNA and sequenced.
A novel mouse cataract was characterized by a nuclear and radial opacification of the lens. The lenses of the mutants are smaller than those of the wild type. The histologic analysis demonstrated degeneration of lens fibers in the lens core. Abnormal remnants of cell nuclei are present throughout the entire lens. Genetic analysis revealed allelism to the Cat2 group of dominant cataracts on mouse chromosome 1; therefore, the cluster of the Cryg genes and the closely linked Cryba2 gene were tested as candidates. A 6-bp deletion in exon 3 of the gammaC-crystallin encoding gene (Crygc) is causative for the cataract phenotype; the mutation is therefore designated CrygcChl3. The deletion of the bases 420 to 425 leads to a loss of two amino acids, Gly and Arg, in the fourth Greek-key motif.
The CrygcChl3 is the first mutation in the mouse affecting the Crygc gene. Dominant mutations for five of the six Cryg genes on mouse chromosome 1 have now been characterized, demonstrating the importance of this gene cluster for lens transparency.
The aim of the study is to determine whether serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1and IL-6 correlate with indices of bone mineral metabolism in children with idiopathic osteoporosis and osteopenia.
The study comprised 62 patients aged 6-18 years (20 with idiopathic osteoporosis, 22 with idiopathic osteopenia, and 20 controls). In 10 children, investigations were repeated after one year of treatment. Serum concentrations of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), as well as IL-6 and its soluble receptor (IL-6sR) were determined by the ELISA method. In patients with decreased bone mass, selected calcium-phosphorus metabolism indices and bone turnover markers were assessed.
Higher values of IL-6 were recorded in those with idiopathic osteoporosis than in controls (2.79 vs. 1.43; p<0.05). In these patients there was also a tendency towards higher values of IL-6sR (p=0.05). IL-1alpha and IL-1beta were not markedly elevated in any of the patients. No significant differences between groups regarding IL-1ra were observed. Negative correlation between IL-6, IL-1alpha, cytokine/receptor indices, and spinal bone mineral density was determined. Positive correlation was found between IL-alpha, IL-1/IL-1ra, and parathormon as well as between IL-1alpha, IL-6sR, and bone formation markers.markers. Increase in bone mass after treatment was accompanied by a decrease in IL-6sR.
The higher serum levels of IL-6 in children with idiopathic osteoporosis/osteopenia and the decrease in IL-6sR after treatment reveal an involvement of IL-6 in the etiopathogenesis of these disturbances. The results suggest that IL-1 may also participate in the primary decrease of bone mass in children.
