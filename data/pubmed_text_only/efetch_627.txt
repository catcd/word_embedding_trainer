Treatment of schizophrenia with antipsychotics is often associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), a disorder involving involuntary muscle movement. Because EPS are often associated with the use of antipsychotics, anticholinergic agents are often indicated.
In this observational, retrospective study, we examined whether the initiation of olanzapine or risperidone, the two most widely prescribed atypical antipsychotics, is related to the adjunctive use of anticholinergic agents.
We identified patients with schizophrenia from outpatient clinics in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) and defined initiation of olanzapine or risperidone as patients who were not on any antipsychotics for 6 months and subsequently initiated on the target drug between 1/4/1999 and 31/3/2000. The data were analysed using tests of means or chi-square tests.
The study yielded two major findings. First, compared with risperidone initiators, there were significantly fewer olanzapine initiators who used at least one anticholinergic agent adjunctively. Secondly, among olanzapine or risperidone initiators, patients who used at least one anticholinergic agent adjunctively tended to stay on the target drug significantly longer than those who did not use any anticholinergic agent adjunctively with the target drug.
As the use of anticholinergics is a proxy for the presence of EPS, these findings suggest that risperidone may be more associated with EPS than olanzapine. However, to assess the benefits and side effects associated with olanzapine or risperidone, future research needs to examine various patient outcomes resulting from the initiation of each drug.
Enalapril either alone or with a diuretic was administered to 15 children with various renal diseases and hypertension. Five were transplant recipients on multiple immunosuppressive agents. No adverse clinical or laboratory experiences were encountered except for mild proteinuria in two children, one of whom has evidence of chronic rejection. Enalapril effectively controlled blood pressure in all 15 patients when given once daily with or without food. Renal function improved in seven children. Six children are under excellent blood pressure control despite a reduction in the dose of enalapril. Two are currently on no medication, five require a diuretic, while one child is on an increased dose of enalapril.
In the present study, protein lysates from microdissected glutathione S-transferase placental-form-positive (GST-P(+)) foci and hepatocellular carcinomas from livers of rats treated with N-diethylnitrosamine followed by phenobarbital at doses of 0 and 500 ppm in the diet for 10 and 33 weeks were analyzed using QSTAR Elite liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and iTRAQ technology. Among 75 proteins, a total of 27 and 50 proteins displaying significant quantitative changes comparing with adjacent normal-appearing liver tissue were identified in GST-P(+) foci of initiation control and promotion groups, respectively, which are related to transcription, protein folding, cytoskeleton filaments reorganization, cell cycle control, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress responses, lipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and signal transduction. Furthermore, Ingenuity Pathway and bioinformatic analyses revealed that expression changes of genes encoding proteins with altered expression detected in GST-P(+) foci are likely to be controlled by c-myc, NRF2, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, nuclear factor kappa B, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 transcriptional factors. Coordinated overexpression of mitochondrial chaperons prohibitin (PHB) and prohibitin 2 (PHB2), septin 9 (SEPT9), neurabin 1, and other cytoskeletal and functional proteins in areas of GST-P(+) foci during initiation and/or promotion stages of rat hepatocarcinogenesis was associated with induction of cell proliferation and might be responsible for the neoplastic transformation of rat liver preneoplastic lesions. Newly discovered elevation of PHB, PHB2, and SEPT9 in GST-P(+) foci and tumors, imply that they might play important role in the onset of liver cancer and be of potential values in the studies of hepatocarcinogenesis.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that dimerizes with ARNT to mediate responses to compounds such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD and other AHR agonists cause toxic responses in early life stages of fish, including the zebrafish, Danio rerio. The most well characterized target gene for the AHR/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) dimer is a cytochrome P450, CYP1A. Induction of CYP1A by TCDD has been correlated with certain toxic responses in developing zebrafish and has been postulated to mediate these responses. To determine whether CYP1A is the important downstream effector enzyme for the AHR/ARNT pathway, we used morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) to block induction of CYP1A in response to TCDD in zebrafish embryos. Although the zfcyp1a-MO effectively prevented CYP1A up-regulation, it did not prevent the signs of developmental toxicity, including pericardial edema, slowed blood flow, craniofacial malformation, and defects in erythropoiesis. We conclude that the important target for the AHR/ARNT pathway in developing zebrafish exposed to TCDD is not zfcyp1a. This suggests an alternative model in which TCDD-activated AHR/ARNT disrupts the normal process of growth and development by altering programs of gene expression or function.
Zinc deficiency (ZD) in rats increases esophageal cell proliferation and the incidence of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine-induced esophageal tumors. Conversely, zinc replenishment (ZR) rapidly induces apoptosis in esophageal epithelia and reverses cancer development. We investigated gene expression changes in ZR versus ZD esophageal epithelia to identify differentially expressed genes associated with the antitumor effect of ZR. Weanling rats were fed a ZD diet for 6 weeks to establish esophageal cell proliferation or a zinc-sufficient (ZS) diet. Then, 10 ZD rats were treated with zinc gluconate intragastrically and switched to ZS diet; the remaining 10 ZD and ZS animals were treated with saline. All animals were killed 26-28 h later. Using cDNA microarrays, real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification and RNA hybridization techniques, we identified novel differentially expressed genes, including a RNA-binding protein with two RNA recognition motifs and a zinc knuckle (ZD7), and a DNA/RNA helicase with a DEAD box (ZD10) with two splice variants, ZD10a and ZD10b. In situ hybridization detected increased mRNA expression of ZD7, ZD10a and ZD10b in ZR esophageal epithelia, which displayed markedly increased occurrence of apoptotic cells, relative to ZD epithelia. Overexpression of ZD7 in human esophageal cancer cells resulted in induction of apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 and -7, activities that were inhibited by caspase-specific inhibitors. In addition, ZD7 mRNA levels and zinc-induced apoptosis in rat squamous carcinoma cells were reduced by specific small interfering ribonucleic acids. Thus, ZR rapidly induces ZD7 and ZD10 expression, which in turn stimulates apoptosis. These results provide the beginnings of a molecular pathway for zinc-induced apoptosis under conditions that reverse esophageal tumor initiation.
Trastuzumab, an anti-HER2/neu monoclonal antibody, is thought to promote HER2/neu receptor internalization and/or turnover. This study was designed to investigate the kinetics of trastuzumab treatment on tumor cells with varying levels of HER2/neu expression and to determine the effect of trastuzumab on HER2/neu-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated lysis.
Three cell lines with varying levels of HER2/neu expression were incubated with varying doses of trastuzumab at multiple time points. Trastuzumab binding and HER2/neu expression were determined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three HLA-A2(+) healthy donors and four E75 peptide-vaccinated patients were stimulated with HER2/neu-derived peptides and tested in standard chromium release cytotoxicity assays with HER2/neu(+) tumor cells pretreated with trastuzumab.
Treatment of tumor cells with 10 microg/mL of trastuzumab in an overnight incubation resulted in saturation of cell-surface HER2/neu receptors. At higher doses, trastuzumab staining and HER2/neu expression decreased in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment of tumor cells with trastuzumab resulted in increases in specific cytotoxicity by peptide-stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes from HLA-A2(+) donors over untreated cells by an average of 5.6% and 15.3% (P = .0002) for doses of 10 and 50 microg/mL, respectively. In similar experiments involving peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from immunized patients, the average specific cytotoxicity for untreated cells was 34.2% +/- 1.3% vs. 40.6% +/- 2.5% (P = .035) and 40.7% +/- 1.6% (P = .0005) for those treated with 10 and 50 microg/mL, respectively.
Our data suggest that pretreatment of breast cancer cells with trastuzumab induces turnover of the HER2/neu protein and enhanced killing by HER2/neu peptide-stimulated CTLs. This increased lysis occurs regardless of the degree of HER2/neu expression and seems more pronounced in vaccinated patients. These findings support further investigation into the use of combination immunotherapy with trastuzumab and HER2/neu peptide-based vaccines.
A patient with compensated congestive heart failure suffered acute deterioration of her renal function and cardiac status, requiring peritoneal dialysis, in association with indomethacin therapy. Discontinuation of this inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis led to a prompt improvement in both her renal function and cardiac status. The patient was rechallenged with indomethacin and again developed acute reduction of her glomerular filtration rate and severe volume retention, which were again totally reversed when the drug was stopped. Urinary prostaglandin E was measured by radioimmunoassay in this patient and five additional patients with congestive heart failure and prerenal azotemia. All patients were found to have elevated levels of urinary prostaglandin E. The possible role for renal prostaglandin E as a compensatory mechanism to the vasoconstrictive stimuli present in congestive heart failure is discussed. The potential danger of inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis in patients with congestive heart failure and prerenal azotemia is emphasized.
The gastrointestinal tract and nervous system are the main targets for metronidazole toxicity. With the possible exception of certain neurotoxic effects in a few heavily treated patients, all the toxic effects of metronidazole are transient and reversible on withdrawal of the drug. Properly designed tests for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in rats, rabbits, and mice have produced convincingly negative results, and no adverse effects on the fetus have been observed in women given the drug for trichomoniasis during various stages of pregnancy. The antimicrobial activity of metronidazole is thought to depend on its nitroreduction to form short-lived cytotoxic metabolites capable of reacting with deoxyribonucleic acid. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that metronidazole has been reported to be mutagenic for certain strains of Salmonella typhimurium. Metronidazole gave negative results in the mouse micronucleus test and no increase in sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes. Prolonged exposure to metronidazole in the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease was not associated with any increase in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations. Prolonged high-dose exposure of mice to metronidazole led to an increased incidence of lung tumors in three separate studies and to a suggestive increase in lymphoreticular neoplasia in female animals in one of the studies. These effects are probably nonspecific, since major effects on the incidence of neoplasms of the same and other kinds have been produced by merely varying the amount of a standard diet that mice consume. A reported excess of liver tumors in rats exposed to metronidazole can be explained by the fact that the authors failed to age standardize their data despite a big and highly significant beneficial effect of the drug on survival. Two carcinogenicity studies in hamsters have given entirely negative results. The follow-up for 10 or more years of 771 women first treated with metronidazole between 1960 and 1969 for trichomoniasis revealed no excess of any form of cancer attributable to treatment, and no excess cancer risk has so far come to light in the Kaiser-Permanente follow-up of nearly 2500 patients given at least one prescription of metronidazole between 1969 and 1973. At the present time it is reasonable to conclude that this highly useful, and sometimes life-saving, drug is essentially free of cancer risk or other serious toxic side effects.
We report on a 6-month-old infant with asthma who developed spasms and hypsarrhythmia on the electroencephalogram (EEG) shortly after starting oral theophylline medication. Theophylline levels at that time were just above the upper normal range. The spasms stopped and the EEG normalized when theophylline was discontinued and nitrazepam therapy started. On follow-up over the next 3 years there was no recurrence of seizures and the child's neurodevelopment has been normal. Nitrazepam was stopped at 10 months and the waking and sleeping EEG were normal at 14 months. We believe that the infantile spasms were caused by theophylline.
It is now widely accepted that progesterone (PROG) brings neuroprotection in lesions of the peripheral and central nervous system. Spinal cord trauma leads to neuronal degeneration, astrogliosis, demyelination, and proliferation of oligodendrocyte-precursor cells (OPCs). In this work, we studied the effects of PROG on myelin-related parameters in rats with complete spinal cord transection (TRX). To this end, sham-operated controls and rats with TRX at thoracic level T10 received vehicle or PROG (4 mg/kg/day) during 3 days. Three variables were measured in the lumbar L4 region below the lesion: (1) expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) at the protein and mRNA levels; (2) density of NG2-immunopositive cells as markers for OPCs; and (3) number of cells immunopositive for RIP, an antibody staining mature oligodendrocytes. TRX decreased MBP immunostaining in the corticospinal tract (CST) and dorsal ascending tract (DAT) but not the ventral funiculus (VF). NG2+ cells, which were detected in low number in controls, increased after TRX in the gray and white matter. RIP-positive cell number, however, remained unchanged. PROG treatment of rats with TRX enhanced the expression of MBP protein and mRNA in CST and DAT, but not VF and highly stimulated the number of cells showing NG2 immunostaining over untreated lesioned rats. Instead, density of RIP positive cells was similar in the PROG-treated and untreated lesioned groups. We propose that PROG effects on expression of MBP and the number of NG2 immunopositive cells may contribute to neuroprotection, as they go in parallel with previous results showing enhanced biochemical and morphological parameters of motoneurons of animals with TRX receiving PROG treatment.
Previous studies from our own group and others have demonstrated that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors could reduce proteinuria in some experimental models of progressive renal disease. To investigate a possible role of COX-2 in podocytes during the course of self-limited glomerular injury, we administered puromycin nucleoside (PAN) on day 1 (15 mg/100 g BW) and day 3 (30 mg/100 g BW) to wild-type and transgenic mice with podocyte-specific COX-2 expression driven by a nephrin promoter. An additional group received both PAN and the COX-2-specific inhibitor, SC58236 (6 mg/l in drinking water). There was no significant difference in the albumin (microg)/creatinine (mg) ratio between wild-type (26.3 +/- 4.2, n = 8) and transgenic (28.9 +/- 2.3, n = 8) mice under baseline conditions. PAN induced significant albuminuria only in the transgenic mice with a peak at day 3: 72.1 +/- 8.9 microg/mg creatinine (n = 12, p < 0.05, compared with basal level), which remitted by day 10 (37.4 +/- 4.4 microg/mg, n = 7, p < 0.05, compared with day 3). Electron microscopy demonstrated that PAN caused 56.7 +/- 4.2% foot process effacement in transgenic mice compared with 38.8 +/- 4.1% in wild type at day 3. PAN increased immunoreactive COX-2 in glomeruli from transgenic mice (day 3: 1.47 +/- 0.08 fold; day 10: 1.25 +/- 0.16 fold, n = 5-9, p < 0.05 compared with basal level), which was restricted to podocytes. Real time PCR indicated that endogenous COX-2 mRNA increased (2.6 +/- 0.1 fold of wild-type control at day 3 and 2.2 +/- 0.2 at day 10, n = 4, p < 0.05), while the nephrin-driven COX-2 mRNA was unchanged. Nephrin mRNA and protein expression were decreased by PAN in the transgenic mice. The COX-2-specific inhibitor, SC58236, reduced foot process effacement in transgenic mice administered PAN to 21.7 +/- 5.2% and significantly reduced the albuminuria at day 3 (42.2 +/- 3.8, n = 13, p < 0.05 compared with untreated) without significantly altering COX-2 expression. In summary, in transgenic mice with podocyte COX-2 overexpression, PAN increased albuminuria and induced foot process fusion. Thus, increased COX-2 expression increased podocyte susceptibility to further injury.
We report a case of paraballism in a young female, which became apparent 4 months after initiating oral contraception. When the oral contraceptive was discontinued, the paraballism decreased and was replaced by choreic movements for a period of approximately 2 weeks. The abnormal movements disappeared gradually. Only 13 cases of paraballism have been reported in medical literature, and none has been attributed to the use of oral contraceptives.
Paraballism in a 28-year old woman, associated with her 4 month intake of oral contraceptives, is described here. This constitutes only the 14th such case in the literature, and the only one in a pill user. The woman had pain in the head and neck when she first took the pill, Ovostat (1 mg lynestrenol, and 50 mcg ethinyl estradiol. Later she developed abnormal movements in the arms, neck and face. She was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward for depression, in response to the movements, and treated briefly with propanolol for palpitations. Her neurological findings were ballet-like movements of both arms, torsion movements of the neck, grimacing of the face, choreiform movements of both hands, and involuntary kicking while walking. The only other findings were an ejection murmur, and hypertrophied interventricular septum on the echocardiogram. When the pill was discontinued, the ballistic movements disappeared within days and the chorea within 2 weeks. The woman was discharged in a month with no complaints. A year later she bore her first child, with no return of abnormal movements.
The aim of this study was to examine the effects of rosiglitazone on adiponectin and plasma glucose levels in relation with common adiponectin gene (ACDC) polymorphisms.
A total of 166 patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) for 12 weeks without changing any of their previous medications. In all, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)45 and SNP276 of ACDC were examined.
Regarding SNP45, there was a smaller reduction in the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level and the HbA(1c) value in the carriers of the GG genotype than in the carriers of the other genotypes (P = 0.031 and 0.013, respectively). There was a smaller increase in the serum adiponectin concentration for the GG genotype than for the other genotypes (P = 0.003). Regarding SNP276, there was less reduction in the FPG level for the GG genotype than for the other genotypes (P = 0.001). In the haplotype analysis, the reductions in the FPG and HbA(1c) levels were smaller for the GG homozygote haplotype than for the other haplotypes (P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). The increase in the plasma adiponectin concentration for the GG homozygote haplotype was smaller than that of the other haplotypes (P = 0.003).
These data suggest that genetic variations in the adiponectin gene can affect the rosiglitazone treatment response of the circulating adiponectin level and blood glucose control in type 2 diabetic patients.
Three thyroid carcinogens, 2,4-diaminoanisole sulfate (DAAS), N,N'-diethylthiourea (DETU) and 4,4'-thiodianiline (TDA), were simultaneously administered in the diet to male F344 rats at one-third the concentration of the reported TD50 levels (610, 200 and 46 p.p.m. respectively) for 52 weeks. The resultant incidence of thyroid adenocarcinomas in the combined treatment group (18/18: 100%) was significantly higher than those in each individual treatment group (DAAS, 0/21; DETU, 1/21; TDA, 2/20). Hepatocellular carcinomas (9/18, 50%) and lung adenomas (6/18, 33%) were also induced by the combined treatment, the incidences being higher than in the TDA group (3/20, 15% and 4/20, 20% respectively) to which these tumors were limited in the three groups treated with single chemicals. Thus, the results indicated that the three carcinogens exert apparent synergism in thyroid carcinogenesis when administered simultaneously.
Morphologic and enzymic changes in heart lysosomes were studied following a chronic treatment of animals with a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg of adriamycin. Myocardial cell damage due to adriamycin included lysosomal changes, sarcotubular swelling, vacuolization and myofibrillar drop-out. These structural changes were more pronounced in the 6-week treated group as opposed to the 3-week treated group. The number of lysosomes per unit area increased from a control value of 3.6 +/- 1.7 to 17.8 +/- 4.0 in the 3-week treated group and 35.9 +/- 9.2 in the 6-week treated groups, respectively. The scatter in the size distribution of lysosomes was much wider in treated animals. Lysosomal hydrolases in the 3-week and 6-week adriamycin-treated group changed as follows: N acetyl beta-glucosaminidase activity fell in the homogenate (H) and nonsedimentable (NS) and rose in the serum (Ser) fractions; a drop in alpha-mannosidase was seen in the sedimentable (S) and Ser fractions; an increase in beta-galactosidase was noted in the H, S and Ser fractions; acid phosphatase was increased in H, S, NS and Ser fractions. Lanthanum staining, used as a cytochemical probe for normal membrane permeability, revealed intracytoplasmic localization of the tracer only in the 6-week group. Malondialdehyde content was increased significantly in the 3-week and 6-weed treated groups. These results show lysosomal changes in adriamycin-treated hearts which precede as well as accompany nonspecific permeability changes in the sarcolemma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Renal calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity is a frequent side effect of immunosuppression with CNIs in solid organ transplantation, leading to acute and chronic renal failure. Acute CNI toxicity is due to vasoconstriction of the vasa afferens and efferens and vacuolization of smooth muscle cells with medial hyalinosis, leading to vessel lumen narrowing. Our case had an acute renal failure 8 months after deceased donor kidney transplantation under treatment with tacrolimus, sirolimus and prednisolone. In Doppler sonography, we observed reverse diastolic intrarenal blood flow, reflecting intense vessel narrowing. There were histological signs of acute CNI toxicity. Within days of reducing the tacrolimus trough level, renal function improved markedly and Doppler sonography showed orthograde intrarenal blood flow. This is the first case of functional, Doppler sonographic evidence for CNI-induced, rapidly reversible narrowing of intrarenal vessels. This case illustrates the potential role of tacrolimus and sirolimus dosing in combination therapy to produce severe intrarenal vasoconstriction.
Pulmonary hypoplasia is one of the main causes for the high mortality rate in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). The expression of surfactant protein A in the hypoplastic CDH lung is reduced, and its concentration is decreased in the amniotic fluid of pregnancies complicated by CDH. In a CDH experimental model, prenatal glucocorticoid treatment has proved its efficacy in correcting the parameters of pulmonary biochemical and morphologic immaturity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether maternal administration of dexamethasone has any effect on the expression of surfactant protein A and surfactant protein B in nitrofen-induced experimental CDH rat model.
CDH was induced in pregnant rats after administration of 100 mg of nitrofen on day 9.5 of gestation (term, 22 days). Dexamethasone (Dex, 0.25 mg/kg) was given by intraperitoneal injection on days 18.5 and 19.5 of gestation. Cesarean section was performed on day 21 of gestation. The fetuses were divided into 3 groups: group I, control (n = 16); group II, nitrofen-induced CDH (n = 16); group III, nitrofen-induced CDH with antenatal Dex treatment (n = 16). Indirect immunohistochemistry was performed using alkaline-phosphatase-coagulated streptavidin using anti-SP-A and anti-SP-B polyclonal antibodies. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to evaluate relative amount of SP-A and SP-B mRNA expression.
In the CDH lung (group II) we observed a markedly reduced number of type II pneumocytes positive for SP-A, and SP-B was increased to a level close to that of the control group. The relative amount of SP-A and SP-B was reduced significantly in group II compared with controls (P < .05) and significantly increased in group III compared with group II animals (P < .01).
These results suggest that antenatal glucocorticoid treatment increases the production of surfactant proteins in the CDH hypoplastic lung.
To evaluate the effect of controlled hypotension combined with acute hypervolemic or normovolemic hemodilution on the splanchnic perfusion in the clinical setting.
Randomized, prospective study.
Inpatient surgery at Nagasaki Rosai Hospital.
28 ASA physical status I and II patients scheduled for total hip arthroplasty.
Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group A (n = 14) received controlled hypotension with acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH). Group B (n = 14) received controlled hypotension with acute hypervolemic hemodilution (HHD). ANH was produced by drawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of 6% hydroxyethyl starch solution (HES). HHD was produced by preoperative infusion of 1000 mL of 6% HES without removing blood. The final hematocrit values were 24+/-2% (mean +/- SD) in Group A and 25+/-3% in Group B. Controlled hypotension was induced with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 80 minutes.
Measurements included the gastric pH (pHi), the arterial blood pH (pHa), and plasma lactate. These indices were measured before hemodilution, after hemodilution, 80 minutes after starting hypotension, 60 minutes after recovery from hypotension, and on the first postoperative day. The value of pHi was measured by tonometric method.
The pHa and lactate values showed no change in either group A or group B throughout the time course. Gastric pHi values in group A showed a significant decrease from 7.424+/-0.033 to 7.335+/-0.038 (p<0.05) after hemodilution, whereas it showed no further decrease at 80 minutes after starting hypotension and 60 minutes after recovery from hypotension. The pHi values in group B showed no significant decrease after hemodilution and no further change at 80 minutes after starting hypotension.
HHD does not impair splanchnic perfusion, whereas ANH might cause impairment. Controlled hypotension with prostaglandin E1 would not impair splanchnic perfusion in combination with either HHD or ANH.
To report a case of carbamazepine toxicity resulting from a drug interaction with fluconazole, and to review the possible mechanisms of this interaction.
Medical record review.
A 33-year-old white man with a history of mental retardation and seizures experienced stupor due to carbamazepine toxicity after fluconazole was initiated. The patient had been taking carbamazepine for several years and maintained stable therapeutic concentrations. He started fluconazole therapy after developing a rash presumably due to candidiasis. After admission to the hospital for carbamazepine toxicity, both fluconazole and carbamazepine were withheld and the patient returned to his normal baseline mental status once the carbamazepine concentration declined to a therapeutic range. Carbamazepine was restarted and the patient experienced no further adverse events. Carbamazepine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme. Fluconazole is renally excreted but has been noted to inhibit CYP3A4. Fluconazole has also been noted to increase phenytoin concentrations.
Fluconazole may cause carbamazepine toxicity presumably by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a common disease in Iran, particularly in Kerman province. It usually occurs via the bite of an infected sandfly.
One hundred and fifty patients suffering from cutaneous leishmaniasis were included in this study in Kerman. The patients were randomly divided into three groups. They were matched with regard to age, sex, duration of the disease, and type, number, and site of the lesions. For each group, one of the following therapeutic methods was applied: (i) oral allopurinol (15 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks; (ii) intramuscular injection of Glucantime (30 mg/kg/day), corresponding to 8 mg/kg/day of pentavalent antimony, for 2 weeks; (iii) combined therapy. The lesions were re-examined at the end of treatment and 2 and 4 weeks later. The response to treatment was graded as excellent (reduction in the size of the lesion by at least 80% or complete clearance), good (reduction in the size of the lesion by 50%), and poor (minimal or no change in the lesion).
The overall results indicated that 18% of patients showed excellent response, 6% good response, and 76% poor response in the first group. In the second group, 24% of patients showed excellent response, 6% good response, and 70% poor response. In the third group, 46% of patients showed excellent response, 8% good response, and 46% poor response.
The results obtained by the three therapeutic methods indicated that combined therapy with allopurinol plus Glucantime was much more effective than that obtained by each of the two drugs when used alone (P < 0.05).
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) plays a central role in the toxic responses to halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins ("dioxins"), in the metabolic adaptation to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and in the development of the mature vascular system. A number of lines of evidence support the idea that the regulation of adaptive metabolism requires an AHR partnership with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). Yet, for AHR-dependent vascular development and dioxin toxicity, the role of ARNT is less certain. In fact, numerous models have been proposed over the years to suggest that the AHR signals in important ways via ARNT-independent events. In an effort to clarify the role of ARNT in AHR-mediated dioxin hepatotoxicity, we generated a conditional Arnt mouse model. Such a model was essential because global inactivation of Arnt results in embryonic lethality presumably due to this protein's role as a heterodimeric partner for the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Using a hepatocyte-specific Arnt deletion, we were able to demonstrate that hepatocyte ARNT is required for major aspects of AHR-mediated dioxin toxicity in the liver. Results from this conditional Arnt allele are also consistent with a model where hepatocyte ARNT is unrelated to AHR-mediated hepatovascular development. In sum, these data suggest that AHR-ARNT dimers within the hepatocyte direct the toxic and adaptive and developmental functions associated with the AHR and that developmental vascular events arise due to signaling in a distinct cell type expressing this dimeric pair.
  Melasma is an irregular brown or grayish-brown symmetric facial hypermelanosis, often affecting women, especially those living in areas with intense ultraviolet radiation.
  Comparison of therapeutic effects of 20% azelaic acid and 4% hydroquinone cream in the treatment of melasma.
  Twenty-nine women with melasma were recruited. Fifteen patients were treated with 4% hydroquinone cream and 14 patients were treated with azelaic acid cream for 2 months. The cream was applied twice daily. A broad-spectrum sunscreen was used concomitantly by both groups. The Melasma Area Severity Index (MASI) scores were determined prior to treatment and at each follow-up.
  The mean MASI score before treatment was 7.2 ± 3.2 in the hydroquinone group and 7.6 ± 3.5 in the azelaic acid group, with no significant difference between them (t-test, CI 95% = -2.9 to 2.2). One month after treatment, the mean MASI score reached 6.7 ± 3.4 with hydroquinone and 6.3 ± 3.4 with azelaic acid with no significant difference between them (t-test, CI 95% = -2.2 to 3). After 2 months' treatment, the MASI score was 6.2 ± 3.6 with hydroquinone and 3.8 ± 2.8 with azelaic acid, a significant statistical difference (t-test, CI 95% = 0.03-4.9).
  In conclusion, this study suggests that 20% azelaic acid cream applied twice daily may be more effective than hydroquinone 4% in reducing mild melasma. However, because this was an open trial, it is suggested that further studies involving large groups of patients be conducted to achieve a more conclusive result.
Multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy (MIL) is a cerebral demyelinating syndrome that develops after chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and levamisole. The authors report a patient who developed MIL after 5-FU administration not in association with levamisole. She was subsequently diagnosed with partial deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, an enzyme necessary for 5-FU catabolism. The authors suggest that MIL is a direct result of 5-FU chemotherapy and that patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency are at increased risk for this and other toxic effects of 5-FU.
At a two years' interval, a patient with severe hypertension was treated with captopril and MK 521, two different angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Each time the blood pressure decreased to normal levels after addition of diuretic therapy but the patient developed acute renal failure. On both occasions the interruption of the inhibitors restored renal function very rapidly. In this woman, considered to suffer from essential hypertension on the basis of a normal intravenous pyelogram, arteriography showed bilateral renal-artery stenosis.
Hydrogen cyanamide is a plant growth regulator used in agriculture to induce bud break in fruit trees. Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and can induce acetaldehyde syndrome in case of alcohol use. The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a disulfiram-like syndrome following occupational exposure to hydrogen cyanamide. The first case involved a 59-year-old man who used Dormex, which contains hydrogen cyanamide, without protection after consuming a large amount of alcohol during a meal. In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of alcohol, he developed malaise with flushing of the face, tachycardia, and dyspnea. Manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospital. The second case occurred in a 55-year-old farmer following cutaneous contact with Dormex. Five hours after exposure, he developed disulfiram-like syndrome with flushing, tachycardia, and arterial hypotension after consuming three glasses of wine. The patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospital. These cases confirm the necessity of avoiding alcohol consumption as recommended in the instructions for use of Dormex and of preventing cutaneous contact during use.
To find a new compound with antiamnesic activity, we screened 29 natural products for their abilities to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia. Among the plants tested Evodia rutaecarpa Bentham showed a strong inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase in vitro and an anti-amnesic effect in vivo. By sequential fractionation of E. rutaecarpa, the active component was finally identified as dehydroevodiamine hydrochloride (DHED). DHED inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in a dose-dependent and non-competitive manner. The IC50 value of DHED is 37.8 microM. A single administration of DHED to rats (6.25 mg/kg) significantly reversed the scopolamine-induced memory impairment in a passive avoidance test. The antiamnesic effect of DHED was more potent than that of tacrine which is the only drug for Alzheimer's disease approved by FDA. This potent antiamnesic effect of DHED was thought to be due to the combined effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibition and the known cerebral blood flow enhancement. These results indicate that DHED has novel anti-cholinesterase and antiamnesic activities and might have therapeutic potential in various disorders including Alzheimer's disease.
