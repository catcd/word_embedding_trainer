Recently, there has been an increased recognition of the association of clozapine with myocarditis and myocardiopathy. Commonly used diagnostic tests have very limited sensitivity in diagnosing this potentially life-threatening complication. We present 3 case reports of clozapine-induced myocarditis/cardiomyopathy that illustrate the development of a combined approach involving a clinical questionnaire and diagnostic testing at our hospital. This combination approach helped in the early recognition and successful treatment of clozapine myocarditis in one of our patients. Given the increasing recognition of this adverse reaction, we felt it timely to report our experience in diagnosing and treating this clinical syndrome.
1 The efficacy of labetalol in lowering blood pressure has been assessed in a group of 16 patients with severe hypertension whose blood pressure was inadequately controlled (supine diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg on two consecutive occasions) on existing therapy or in whom severe side-effects necessitated a change in therapy. 2 All patients had an original pretreatment supine diastolic blood pressure of greater than 120 mmHg and most had evidence of target organ damage. Patients were hospitalized for the purposes of changeover of therapy, labetalol being added to the existing regime which was reduced stepwise and eventually withdrawn. 3 Treatment with labetalol resulted in satisfactory blood pressure control in 10 of 16 patients in this study but high doses were required, the mean daily dose being 3,091 mg (range 1,200-8,000). 4 Treatment with discontinued in 6 patients on account of postural hypotension (3), failure to control supine diastolic blood pressure (2) and retention of urine (1). Long-term treatment was relatively free from side-effects. 5 From preliminary studies in animals it is suggested that an action within the central nervous system may contribute to the hypotensive effect of labetalol.
Whether nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors increase the risk of myocardial infarction in HIV-infected individuals is unclear. Our aim was to explore whether exposure to such drugs was associated with an excess risk of myocardial infarction in a large, prospective observational cohort of HIV-infected patients.
We used Poisson regression models to quantify the relation between cumulative, recent (currently or within the preceding 6 months), and past use of zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine, and abacavir and development of myocardial infarction in 33 347 patients enrolled in the D:A:D study. We adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors that are unlikely to be affected by antiretroviral therapy, cohort, calendar year, and use of other antiretrovirals.
Over 157,912 person-years, 517 patients had a myocardial infarction. We found no associations between the rate of myocardial infarction and cumulative or recent use of zidovudine, stavudine, or lamivudine. By contrast, recent-but not cumulative-use of abacavir or didanosine was associated with an increased rate of myocardial infarction (compared with those with no recent use of the drugs, relative rate 1.90, 95% CI 1.47-2.45 [p=0.0001] with abacavir and 1.49, 1.14-1.95 [p=0.003] with didanosine); rates were not significantly increased in those who stopped these drugs more than 6 months previously compared with those who had never received these drugs. After adjustment for predicted 10-year risk of coronary heart disease, recent use of both didanosine and abacavir remained associated with increased rates of myocardial infarction (1.49, 1.14-1.95 [p=0.004] with didanosine; 1.89, 1.47-2.45 [p=0.0001] with abacavir).
There exists an increased risk of myocardial infarction in patients exposed to abacavir and didanosine within the preceding 6 months. The excess risk does not seem to be explained by underlying established cardiovascular risk factors and was not present beyond 6 months after drug cessation.
Abamectin (ABA), which belongs to the family of avermectins, is used as a parasiticide; however, ABA poisoning can impair liver function. In a previous study using isolated rat liver mitochondria, we observed that ABA inhibited the activity of adenine nucleotide translocator and FoF1-ATPase. The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of ABA toxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes and to evaluate whether this effect is dependent on its metabolism. The toxicity of ABA was assessed by monitoring oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular ATP concentration, cell viability, intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, release of cytochrome c, caspase 3 activity and necrotic cell death. ABA reduces cellular respiration in cells energized with glutamate and malate or succinate. The hepatocytes that were previously incubated with proadifen, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, are more sensitive to the compound as observed by a rapid decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by reductions in ATP concentration and cell viability and a disruption of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis followed by necrosis. Our results indicate that ABA biotransformation reduces its toxicity, and its toxic action is related to the inhibition of mitochondrial activity, which leads to decreased synthesis of ATP followed by cell death.
A correlation between increase in the integration of Human Immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) cDNA and cell death was previously established. Here we show that combination of peptides that stimulate integration together with the protease inhibitor Ro 31-8959 caused apoptotic cell death of HIV infected cells with total extermination of the virus. This combination did not have any effect on non-infected cells. Thus it appears that cell death is promoted only in the infected cells. It is our view that the results described in this work suggest a novel approach to specifically promote death of HIV-1 infected cells and thus may eventually be developed into a new and general anti-viral therapy.
Cocaine modulates serum levels of progesterone in intact female and male rats, as well as in pregnant dams, and progesterone decreases or attenuates cocaine-induced behavioral and reward responses. It has been postulated that cocaine's modulation of serum progesterone levels may in turn alter progesterone receptor activity, thereby contributing to cocaine-induced alterations of neuronal functions and genomic regulations. To test this hypothesis, intact male rats received acute injections of saline or cocaine (15 or 30 mg/kg, dissolved in 0.9% saline, intraperitoneal). Progesterone serum levels, progesterone receptor (PR) protein levels, and PR-DNA binding complexes were measured in the striatum by radioimmunoassay, Western blot, and gel shift analyses, respectively. After injection of 15 mg/kg of cocaine, induction of progesterone serum levels was closely followed by an increase in receptor protein levels and DNA binding complexes. After injection of 30 mg/kg of cocaine, similar effects were observed along with an attenuation of receptor protein levels and DNA binding complexes at 60 min. Our results suggest that activation of progesterone receptors may be a mechanism by which cocaine mediates behavior through molecular alterations in the central nervous system.
Hippocampal damage contributes to cognitive dysfunction after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We previously showed that Fluoro-Jade, a fluorescent stain that labels injured, degenerating brain neurons, quantifies the extent of hippocampal injury after experimental fluid percussion TBI in rats. Coincidentally, we observed that injured neurons in the rat hippocampus also stained with Newport Green, a fluorescent dye specific for free ionic zinc. Here, we show that, regardless of injury severity or therapeutic intervention, the post-TBI population of injured neurons in rat hippocampal subfields CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus is indistinguishable, both in numbers and anatomical distribution, from the population of neurons containing high levels of zinc. Treatment with lamotrigine, which inhibits presynaptic release of glutamate and presumably zinc that is co-localized with glutamate, reduced numbers of Fluoro-Jade-positive and Newport Green-positive neurons equally as did treatment with nicardipine, which blocks voltage-gated calcium channels through which zinc enters neurons. To confirm using molecular techniques that Fluoro-Jade and Newport Green-positive neurons are equivalent populations, we isolated total RNA from 25 Fluoro-Jade-positive and 25 Newport Green-positive pyramidal neurons obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from the CA3 subfield, linearly amplified the mRNA and used quantitative ribonuclease protection analysis to demonstrate similar expression of mRNA for selected TBI-induced genes. Our data suggest that therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing neurotoxic zinc levels after TBI may reduce hippocampal neuronal injury.
Hereditary chronic pancreatitis (HCP) is a very rare form of early-onset chronic pancreatitis. Apart from young age at diagnosis and a slower progression, the clinical course, morphological features and laboratory findings of HCP do not differ from those of patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Diagnostic criteria and treatment of HCP also resemble those of chronic pancreatitis of other causes. The clinical presentation is highly variable and includes chronic abdominal pain, impairment of endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function, nausea and vomiting, maldigestion, diabetes, pseudocysts, bile-duct and duodenal obstruction, and rarely pancreatic cancer. Fortunately, the disease is mild in most patients. Mutations in the PRSS1 gene, encoding cationic trypsinogen, play a causative role in chronic pancreatitis. It has been shown that the PRSS1 mutations increase autocatalytic conversion of trypsinogen to active trypsin, and thus probably cause premature, intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation, disturbing the intrapancreatic balance of proteases and their inhibitors. Other genes--such as the anionic trypsinogen (PRSS2), the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)--have also been found to be associated with chronic pancreatitis (idiopathic and hereditary). Genetic testing should only be performed in carefully selected patients by direct DNA sequencing, and antenatal diagnosis should not be encouraged. Treatment focuses on enzyme and nutritional supplementation, pain management, pancreatic diabetes, and local organ complications such as pseudocysts and bile-duct or duodenal obstruction. The disease course and prognosis of patients with HCP is unpredictable. The risk of pancreatic cancer is elevated. Therefore, HCP patients should strongly avoid environmental risk factors for pancreatic cancer.
A 76-year-old woman was scheduled to undergo distal gastrectomy and cholecystectomy. She had no history of illnesses including hypertension. During the induction of anesthesia, she developed hypertension just after intravenous administration of fentanyl 200 microg. The marked hypertension lasted for 30 min without any complaints and neurological symptoms, and gradually became normalized. We started the induction of anesthesia again without using fentanyl. For the maintenance of anesthesia, sevoflurane, nitrous oxide, and epidural anesthesia with intermittent administration of 0.75% ropivacaine were used. The operation was finished successfully without any complications. We consider intravenous small dose of fentanyl could be a cause of unexpected marked hypertension in this elderly patient.
Sixty-six patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with 4'-epi-doxorubicin at a dose of 90 mg/m2 by rapid IV injection every 21 days until the disease had progressed or to a maximum cumulative dose of 540 mg/m2. Myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, and alopecia were the almost frequent side effects, but their incidence seemed lower than that after a comparable dosage of doxorubicin. After a cumulative dose of 540 mg/m2 a significant decrease of QRS complex deflection on the electrocardiogram was detected, but no case of congestive heart failure was observed. Partial remission and minor remission were achieved, respectively, in nine (15%) and five (9%) out of 59 evaluable patients for a median duration of 6 months. Partial remission occurred in anthracycline-sensitive tumors like breast cancer (4 of 13), lung cancer (1 of 17), head and neck cancer (1 of 8), gastric cancer (2 of 4), and ovarian cancer (1 of 1).
We have proposed that glutamine serves in a facilitated diffusion process, mediated by the enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; gamma GT) and that it leaves the brain in exchange for entering amino acids. Glutamine is also a precursor of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Thus, providing an alternate substrate for gamma GT should spare brain glutamine, raise GABA, and cause an anticonvulsant effect. We have found that glycylglycine, the best-known substrate for gamma GT, and delta-aminovaleric acid (DAVA), a structural analog, have anticonvulsant activity in DBA/2J mice. Both compounds can decrease the incidence and severity of seizures induced by L-methionine-RS-sulfoximine or electroconvulsive shock. DAVA was also tested and found to be active against seizures caused by pentylenetetrazol or picrotoxin. [14C]DAVA entered the brain at the rate of 18.7 nmol/g/min. The activity of DAVA as a substrate of gamma GT was intermediate to that of glycylglycine and glutamine. Preliminary studies have shown that brain glutamine and perhaps GABA are elevated 3 h after administration of DAVA (7.5 mmol/kg). These findings support the theory that glutamine exchange plays a role in amino acid transport across the blood-brain barrier and suggests a new concept in anticonvulsant therapy.
Exercise-induced acute renal failure (ARF) developed in a 45-year-old man during antihypertensive therapy with losartan and trichlormethiazide. The antihypertensive therapy was stopped and marked hypouricemia became apparent during improvement of his renal function. The daily urinary excretion of uric acid was normal and an increased fractional excretion of uric acid was observed. Renal biopsy revealed that the kidney was recovering from acute tubular necrosis with interstitial fibrosis. Based on the results of pyrazinamide and benzbromarone tests, we classified this case as one of presecretory reabsorption defect of uric acid. Antihypertesive therapy with benidipine and candesartan was initiated, and the patient has not had any ARF episodes since. Because idiopathic renal hypouricemia can be associated with exercise-induced ARF and chronic renal dysfunction, careful antihypertensive therapy and follow-up evaluation of renal function might be necessary for hypertensive patients with idiopathic renal hypouricemia.
In this study the effects of a new calcium entry blocking agent, 2,6-dimethyl-3-methoxycarbonyl-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-5-(2-furoyl)-1, 4-dihydropyridine (MDL 72567), were compared with those of nifedipine on blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, and cardiac contractility indices in conscious sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated (SA-denervated) rats and their sham-operated controls. In sham-operated rats, the calcium-entry blocking agents (0.1-2 mg/kg i.v.) produced equivalent falls in blood pressure. However, nifedipine caused a much greater reflex tachycardia which was accompanied by a negative inotropic effect, and with the highest dose (2 mg/kg), a prolongation of the PQ interval. MDL 72567 induced an increase in myocardial contractility. In SA-denervated rats, both drugs produced an enhanced fall in blood pressure accompanied by a negative inotropic effect. Nifedipine did not change heart rate in SA-denervated rats, whereas MDL 72567 caused bradycardia. Thus, in these experiments, MDL 72567 caused less reflex tachycardia for a given fall in blood pressure than nifedipine and was less likely to cause myocardial depression. These effects of MDL 72567 may represent valuable, clinically relevant advantages over nifedipine.
To determine the utility of the serum concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a marker of disease activity and therapeutic efficacy in visceral leishmaniasis (VL), IL-6 levels were measured in 19 patients with active VL from Sudan before and after treatment. IL-6 levels were 30 +/- 6 pg/ml during the active phase of the disease, decreased to levels around the detection limit of the assay (2 pg/ml) directly after successful antimony therapy, and remained low or undetectable for up to 6 months in persistently cured patients (P < 0.005 versus baseline). In 2 patients who had a relapse of VL, IL-6 was elevated at the time the relapse was diagnosed. Two patients with post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis did not have detectable IL-6 in their circulation. Sequential measurements of serum IL-6 levels may be useful for monitoring therapeutic efficacy in patients with VL.
Interactions between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) and the novel proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (CFZ) were investigated in GC- and activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) cells. Coadministration of subtoxic or minimally toxic concentrations of CFZ) with marginally lethal concentrations of HDACIs (vorinostat, SNDX-275, or SBHA) synergistically increased mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis in both GC- and ABC-DLBCL cells. These events were associated with Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38MAPK activation, abrogation of HDACI-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB activation, AKT inactivation, Ku70 acetylation, and induction of gammaH2A.X. Genetic or pharmacologic JNK inhibition significantly diminished CFZ/vorinostat lethality. CFZ/vorinostat induced pronounced lethality in 3 primary DLBCL specimens but minimally affected normal CD34(+) hematopoietic cells. Bortezomib-resistant GC (SUDHL16) and ABC (OCI-LY10) cells exhibited partial cross-resistance to CFZ. However, CFZ/vorinostat dramatically induced resistant cell apoptosis, accompanied by increased JNK activation and gammaH2A.X expression. Finally, subeffective vorinostat doses markedly increased CFZ-mediated tumor growth suppression and apoptosis in a murine xenograft OCI-LY10 model. These findings indicate that HDACIs increase CFZ activity in GC- and ABC-DLBCL cells sensitive or resistant to bortezomib through a JNK-dependent mechanism in association with DNA damage and inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activation. Together, they support further investigation of strategies combining CFZ and HDACIs in DLBCL.
Thirty-one patients with advanced stage squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were treated with the four-drug combination fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine. Four patients achieved complete remission (13%) and 15 partial remission (45%). The only factor of adverse prognostic significance was poor initial patient performance. Median survival for the patients entering complete remission exceeded 54 weeks and was 43 weeks for patients achieving partial remission. Seven patients are still alive at 50 weeks. This represents a notable prolongation of survival compared with those patients who did not achieve remission. Toxicity for the combination was not excessive; myelosuppression and vincristine-induced neuropathy were the most prominent. These results are moderately encouraging and confirm the sensitivity of cervical carcinoma to systemic chemotherapy. Further studies to define the optimal use of chemotherapy in both advanced and earlier stages of disease are warranted.
Reactive oxygen species are involved in gentamicin (GM) nephrotoxicity, and garlic is effective in preventing or ameliorating oxidative stress. Therefore, the effect of garlic on GM nephrotoxicity was investigated in this work. Four groups of rats were studied: (i) fed normal diet (CT), (ii) treated with GM (GM), (iii) fed 2% garlic diet (GA), and (iv) treated with GM and 2% garlic diet (GM + GA). Rats were placed in metabolic cages and GM nephrotoxicity was induced by injections of GM (75 mg/kg every 12 h) for 6 d. Lipoperoxidation and enzyme determinations were made in renal cortex on day 7. GM nephrotoxicity was made evident on day 7 by (i) tubular histological damage, (ii) enhanced BUN and urinary excretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and (iii) decreased creatinine clearance. These alterations were prevented or ameliorated in GM + GA group. The rise in lipoperoxidation and the decrease in Mn-SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities observed in the GM group, were prevented in the GM + GA group. Cu, Zn-SOD activity and Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD content did not change. CAT activity and content decreased in the GM, GA, and GM + GA groups. CAT mRNA levels decreased in the GM group. The protective effect of garlic is associated with the prevention of the decrease of Mn-SOD and GPx activities and with the rise of lipoperoxidation in renal cortex.
Fanconi anemia (FA), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a progressive pancytopenia associated with congenital anomalies and high predisposition to malignancies, is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. At least eight complementation groups (FA-A to FA-H) have been identified. Previously, we studied mutations of the FANCA gene, responsible for FA-A, and found pathogenic mutations in 12 of 15 unclassified Japanese FA patients. Here, we further studied an additional 5 FA patients for sequence alterations of the FANCA gene and found pathogenic mutations in 2 of them. We further analyzed mutations of the FANCC and FANCG genes, responsible for FA-C and FA-G, respectively, in the remaining 6 FA patients. Although there was no alterations in the FANCC gene in these 6 patients, two novel mutations of the FANCG gene, causing aberrant RNA splicing, were detected in 2 FA patients. One was a base substitution from G to C of the invariant GT dinucleotides at the splice donor site of intron 3, resulting in the skipping of exon 3, as well as the skipping of exons 3 and 4. The other was a base substitution from C to T in exon 8, creating a nonsense codon (Q356X). This mutation resulted in the exclusion of a sequence of 18 nucleotides containing the mutation from the mRNA, without affecting the splicing potential of either the authentic or the cryptic splice donor site. Collectively, 14 of the 20 unclassified Japanese FA patients belong to the FA-A group, 2 belong to the FA-G group, and none belongs to the FA-C group.
Forty-six eligible women with advanced metastatic breast cancer were entered on a Phase II trial utilizing esorubicin (4'-deoxydoxorubicin) given in a dosage of 30 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. No patient had received anthracyclines or cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease. Twenty-three (50% of patients) had prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 21 (46%) had prior hormonal therapy, and 32 (70%) were postmenopausal. Dominant site of disease was visceral in 26 (57%), bone in 14 (30%), and soft tissue in 6 (13%). There were 3 complete and 13 partial responders observed, for a 35% response rate; 95% confidence interval for response was 21-49%. Median response duration was 4.0 months (range 2-21 months), and one partial responder remains on study at 6.3 months. Thirty-nine of 46 patients have died; median survival was 10.1 months. Toxicity was primarily hematologic, with 2 drug-related septic deaths. In addition, 2 patients developed severe congestive heart failure secondary to esorubicin cardiotoxicity (at 687 and 770 mg/m2, respectively), which resulted in one patient death. Nausea and vomiting were severe in 16% of patients, but total alopecia was only noted in 4 (9%). Esorubicin is an active agent in metastatic breast cancer; its role in treatment remains undefined.
We report severe hypotension after induction of general anesthesia in a patient receiving an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and an alpha-blocker. A 50-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who had been treated with candesartan cilexetil and doxazosin was scheduled for vitreous surgery. He was operated on for vitreous surgery three times. He developed severe hypotension after induction of anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl on two occasions, when he was taking candesartan cilexetil and doxazosin. Repeated injections of intravenous ephedrine could not raise the blood pressure. After discontinuation of both drugs, although he developed hypotension after induction of anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl, hypotension was mild and responded promptly to intravenous ephedrine.
Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system has been the focus of considerable research as the enzymatic pathway resulting in the production of angiotensin II is implicated in the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
Blocking the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is an effective blood pressure control measure, but is less than ideal due to incomplete blockade and the effects of concomitant blockade of kinase II.
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists block the renin-angiotensin system at the receptor level, and thus impede the system regardless of the pathway responsible for the formation of ACE. Irbesartan is a new, unique angiotensin II receptor antagonist with favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties that are close to ideal for an antihypertensive agent. Irbesartan is a specific AT1 receptor antagonist with rapid oral bioavailability (peak plasma concentrations occurring at 1.5-2 h after administration) and a long half-life (11-15 h) that provides 24-h blood pressure control with a single daily dose. The maximal blood pressure fall occurs between 3 and 6 h after the dose. Unlike other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, irbesartan is relatively unaffected by food or drugs.
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of irbesartan have been demonstrated to provide superior blood pressure control and tolerability in all classes of hypertension and patient populations.
The cation [Cr(3)O(propionate)(6)(H(2)O)(3)](+) has recently been found by oral or intravenous administration to increase insulin sensitivity and improve serum lipids in healthy and type 2 diabetic model rats. Serum insulin concentrations and, hence, insulin sensitivity are in part responsible for the relationship between diet and the incidence of colorectal cancer. This strongly suggested that the synthetic cation, which in vitro is able to stimulate insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in a fashion similar to the oligopeptide chromodulin, could influence the incidence of colorectal cancer. Consequently, the effects of the cation on the inhibition of colon tumorigenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in male Sprague Dawley rats were examined. Gavage administration of aqueous solutions of the complex (1000 microg Cr/kg body mass daily for 6 months) resulted in significantly decreased colon tumor incidence (P<0.003).
To compare the effect of ouabain on the blood pressure of rats with that of digoxin to find the evidences of the relationship between endogenous ouabain (EO) and development of hypertension.
Sprague-Dawley rats, which were divided into 3 groups, were infused with ouabain (23 x 75 micrograms.kg-1/day, i.p.), digoxin (36 x 84 micrograms.kg-1/day, i.p.) and normal saline (NS) once a day respectively. Systolic blood pressure and body weight were recorded weekly. Five weeks later, rats of ouabain group were randomly assigned to three infusion subgroups: Oc group, continued with ouabain infusion; Od group, added digoxin (73 x 68 micrograms.kg-1/day, i.p.) and Os group, stopped administration of ouabain. Another week later, direct blood pressure was recorded in aorta. Systolic and diastolic cardiac function, plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels of all the rats were measured.
After a latent period of one week, blood pressure of Ouabain group increased significantly [95.4 +/- 11.8 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) at the beginning of the experiment vs 122.5 +/- 16.9 mmHg at the end of week 6, P < 0.05] with normal plasma renin activity and higher aldosterone (1.28 +/- 0.45 ng/ml vs 0.69 +/- 0.27 ng/ml, P < 0.05). The blood pressure decreased after either withdrawal of ouabain or addition of digoxin (116.3 +/- 14.4 mmHg vs 100 +/- 10.7 mmHg, P < 0.05; 123.9 +/- 13.9 vs 103.3 +/- 10.5 mmHg, P < 0.05, respectively). No difference of blood pressure was found between the digoxin and NS group.
Our results suggested that EO might be one of the causes of the development of hypertension. Aldosterone might play some role in the mechanism of ouabain-induced hypertension. Digoxin can not induce hypertension. There is a great difference between the effect of ouabain and digoxin on the blood pressure. Moreover, digoxin can reverse the hypertension induced by ouabain.
Hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease is characterized by abnormal proliferation of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, leading to occlusion of pulmonary arterioles, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, and death. Compounds with antiproliferative effects on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, may prevent the development of experimental hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease. Pneumonectomized rats injected with monocrotaline at 7 days develop severe hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease with neointimal formation. Rats were randomized to receive either vehicle or treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin (2 mg/kg per day). By Day 35, rats that received vehicle had higher mean pulmonary arterial pressures (53 +/- 2 mm Hg) and right ventricular hypertrophy (right ventricle/[left ventricle plus septum] [RV/LV+S] = 0.78 +/- 0.09) than rats in Group PMS5-35 that received simvastatin from Day 5 to 35 (mean pulmonary arterial pressure = 27 +/- 3 mm Hg, RV/LV+S = 0.34 +/- 0.08; p < or = 0.001). Pulmonary vascular remodeling with neointimal formation consisting of vascular smooth muscle cells was more severe in vehicle-treated rats (vascular occlusion score, 1.98 +/- 0.02) than in Group PMS5-35 (vascular occlusion score, 0.59 +/- 0.46; p < 0.001). In addition, lung endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene expression was decreased in vehicle-treated animals but was restored toward normal levels in simvastatin-treated animals. Simvastatin attenuates monocrotaline-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling with neointimal formation, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and right ventricular hypertrophy in rats.
Sodium, potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity and the sensitivity of rat myocardium to ouabain was studied in isoproterenol (IPR)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. IPR in a dose of 5 mg/kg was administered to rats intraperitoneally, once daily, for seven days. Left ventricular trabeculae originating from IPR-treated rats were significantly less sensitive than controls to ouabain-induced positive inotropy. In crude homogenate and sarcolemmal fractions the ATP hydrolysing activity both in the presence of Mg++ (basic) and Mg++, Na+, K+ (total) was significantly reduced in the heart of IPR-treated rats. The difference between the total and basic ATPase, i.e. the Na+, K(+)-stimulated portion of the activity was slightly reduced, but the sensitivity of Na+, K(+)-ATPase to ouabain remained unchanged. The results indicate that the well-known relation of sodium pump inhibition to positive inotropy in the heart of IPR-treated rats may not be valid.
We examined the potential role of prostaglandins in the development of analgesic nephropathy in the Gunn strain of rat. The homozygous Gunn rats have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the absence of glucuronyl transferase, leading to marked bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla. These rats are also highly susceptible to develop papillary necrosis with analgesic administration. We used homozygous (jj) and phenotypically normal heterozygous (jJ) animals. Four groups of rats (n = 7) were studied: jj and jJ rats treated either with aspirin 300 mg/kg every other day or sham-treated. After one week, slices of cortex, outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and prostaglandin synthesis was determined by radioimmunoassay. The other kidney was examined histologically. A marked corticomedullary gradient of prostaglandin synthesis was observed in all groups. PGE2 synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla, but not cortex or inner medulla, of jj (38 +/- 6 ng/mg prot) than jJ rats (15 +/- 3) (p less than 0.01). Aspirin treatment reduced PGE2 synthesis in all regions, but outer medullary PGE2 remained higher in jj (18 +/- 3) than jJ rats (9 +/- 2) (p less than 0.05). PGF2 alpha was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of jj rats with and without aspirin administration (p less than 0.05). The changes in renal prostaglandin synthesis were accompanied by evidence of renal damage in aspirin-treated jj but not jJ rats as evidenced by: increased incidence and severity of hematuria (p less than 0.01); increased serum creatinine (p less than 0.05); and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions (p less than 0.005 compared to either sham-treated jj or aspirin-treated jJ). These results suggest that enhanced prostaglandin synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity, and that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may lead to pathological renal medullary lesions and deterioration of renal function.
