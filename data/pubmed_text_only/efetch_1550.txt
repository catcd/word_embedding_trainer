Cancer of the salivary gland is one of the common cancers in the head and the neck regions. This type of cancer develops in the minor and the major salivary glands, and it sometimes metastasizes to other organs, particularly the lung. Morphologic mimicry and similarity in the expression of steroid hormone receptors between salivary gland tumors (SGTs) and breast tumors are well-known phenomena and are occasionally debated in the field of surgical pathology. Progesterone (Pg), one of the female sex steroid hormone, is intimately involved in the development of the mammary gland. Further, it is believed that Pg plays a role in breast cancer progression. However, little is known regarding its role in SGTs. In this study, we used ACCM, a human adenoid cystic carcinoma cell line established from the salivary gland, in order to clarify the role of the Pg receptor (PR) on cell proliferation. No effect of Pg on cell proliferation was observed in the PR-deficient aggressive ACCM cells. However, after introducing PR into the ACCM cells, Pg markedly inhibited the proliferative activity of the cells. This inhibitory effect on cell proliferation was accompanied by p21 upregulation, and Id1 and c-myc downregulation. Moreover, Pg-treated PR transfectants showed significant morphological change; they appeared more flattened and spread out when compared with the ethanol-treated control cells. Our results provided significant insights into the mechanism of suppression of the proliferative property of the cells via the function of PR, and suggested that PR reintroduction therapy might be a viable method of inhibiting human SGT progression.
Fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in a dose dependent manner potentiated the action of amphetamine in the tests for locomotor activity (Knoll's motimeter) and stereotypy. They also antagonized the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. FDP increased the level of amphetamine 90 min after the drug administration, and depressed it 120 min after the treatment. FDP slightly depressed the level of dopamine, and increased that of homovanillic acid in the striatum. They also potentiated the accumulation of noradrenaline in the hippocampus, produced by amphetamine, but did not affect the concentrations of dopamine and serotonin. It is suggested that the change in action of amphetamine under the influence of FDP depends on the direct effect of the peptides on amphetamine level in the brain, and on the level of some neuromediators.
Prenatal exposure to low doses of lindane has been shown to affect the ontogeny of xenobiotic metabolizing cytochrome P450s (CYPs), involved in the metabolism and neurobehavioral toxicity of lindane. Attempts were made in the present study to investigate the responsiveness of CYPs in offspring prenatally exposed to lindane (0.25 mg/kg b. wt.; 1/350th of LD(50); p. o. to mother) when challenged with 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) or phenobarbital (PB), inducers of CYP1A and 2B families or a sub-convulsant dose of lindane (30 mg/kg b. wt., p. o.) later in life. Prenatal exposure to lindane was found to produce an increase in the mRNA and protein expression of CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B1, 2B2 isoforms in brain and liver of the offspring at postnatal day 50. The increased expression of the CYPs in the offspring suggests the sensitivity of the CYPs during postnatal development, possibly, to low levels of lindane, which may partition into mother's milk. A higher increase in expression of CYP1A and 2B isoenzymes and their catalytic activity was observed in animals pretreated prenatally with lindane and challenged with MC (30 mg/kg, i. p. x 5 days) or PB (80 mg/kg, i. p. x 5 days) when young at age (approx. 7 weeks) compared to animals exposed to MC or PB alone. Further, challenge of the control and prenatally exposed offspring with a single sub-convulsant dose of lindane resulted in an earlier onset and increased incidence of convulsions in the offspring prenatally exposed to lindane have demonstrated sensitivity of the CYPs in the prenatally exposed offspring. Our data assume significance as the subtle changes in the expression profiles of hepatic and cerebral CYPs in rat offspring during postnatal development could modify the adult response to a later exposure to xenobiotics.
Endocrine disruptive compounds (EDC) alter hormone-stimulated, nuclear receptor-dependent physiological and developmental processes by a variety of mechanisms. One recently identified mode of endocrine disruption is through hormone sensitization, where the EDC modulates intracellular signaling pathways that control nuclear receptor function, thereby regulating receptor transcriptional activity indirectly. Methoxyacetic acid (MAA), the primary, active metabolite of the industrial solvent ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and a testicular toxicant, belongs to this EDC class. Modulation of nuclear receptor activity by MAA could contribute to the testicular toxicity associated with MAA exposure. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of MAA on the transcriptional activity of several nuclear receptors including the androgen receptor (AR), which plays a pivotal role in the development and maturation of spermatocytes. AR transcriptional activity is shown to be increased by MAA through a tyrosine kinase signaling pathway that involves PI3-kinase. In a combinatorial setting with AR antagonists, MAA potentiated the AR response without significantly altering the EC(50) for androgen responsiveness, partially alleviating the antagonistic effect of the anti-androgens. Finally, MAA treatment of TM3 mouse testicular Leydig cells markedly increased the expression of Cyp17a1 and Shbg while suppressing Igfbp3 expression by ~90%. Deregulation of these genes may alter androgen synthesis and action in a manner that contributes to MAA-induced testicular toxicity.
A hypersensitivity reaction to orally administered phenoxymethyl penicillin is reported. The manifestations of the reaction included fever, arthralgia, urticaria and an irregular pulse. Serial ECG showed second-degree atrioventricular block with junctional escape beats, an atypical Wenckebach pattern and, finally, first-degree atrioventricular block with gradually decreasing PR intervals. A normal tracing was recorded on the sixth day despite the persistence of the rash and joint pains.
Over thirty million Americans are estimated to have tried cocaine at least once and 5 million use it on a regular basis. Recent media attention to the widespread use of cocaine has revealed the growing life-threatening complications that accompany its use. The effects of cocaine on the cardiovascular, pulmonary and central nervous system have been well-described in medical literature, but the complications of acute renal failure secondary to cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis only recently have been addressed. Presented in this article is a case involving cocaine-induced acute renal failure.
This study examines the clinical characteristics of patients with methamphetamine-induced organic mental disorders that were seen in a psychiatric emergency service. This was a highly dysfunctional group, requiring psychiatric hospitalization in 90% of cases. The most consistent clinical feature was the presence of an organic delusional syndrome, with paranoid ideation and hallucinations. Methamphetamine abusers were also unique in their propensity for violence; 43% of the group had clear histories of aggression towards others. The increasing use of methamphetamine together with its ability to produce severe dysfunction is a major concern of professionals and communities alike in terms of treatment [corrected].
We report a case of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) after the patient had received several anti-cancer drugs, including vincristine (VCR), in a patient with myeloid antigen positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (My(+)-ALL). A 53-year-old woman presented at the hospital complaining of high-grade fever and general lassitude. Further examination revealed that she had My(+)-ALL. On admission, she was treated with anti-cancer drugs, including VCR. On day 24, after the first administration of VCR, a conscious disturbance suddenly occurred and she was diagnosed with SIADH. A plain head CT scan showed a low density lesion through the gray matter to the white matter in the bilateral occipital lobe, as well as diffuse swelling of the cerebrum. This was not seen on the follow up CT scan, and we concluded that it had been a transient abnormal finding due to SIADH. She achieved complete remission after induction chemotherapy and 3 added courses of consolidation chemotherapy. VCR was also administered 4 times in the second consolidation chemotherapy, but hyponatremia did not occur. This case suggests that a head CT scan is a useful procedure for the diagnosis and monitoring of SIADH, and that VCR may still be used in a patient who has suffered from VCR-induced SIADH.
High levels of prostaglandins (PGs) are currently found in tumoral cells, due to expression of the inducible PGs synthesis enzyme, the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2). Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) possess an antitumoral effect related, in a large extend, to the inhibition of this enzyme. It was recently suggested that the decreased activity of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), the key enzyme catabolysing PGs, may be responsible too for experimentally induced colon tumor enhancement. We report here, for the first time, that indomethacin, an NSAID, decreased TT cell proliferation, derived from a human Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC). This effect is time and concentration-dependent. Moreover, indomethacin enhanced expression and activity of 15-PGDH. The 15-PGDH levels were negatively correlated with TT cell proliferation (r = -0.52, p < 0.001). Indomethacin, known to decrease COX levels and activity, could also act in modifying catabolism of PGs. This suggests that 15-PGDH is involved in tumoral development, and could therefore be considered as a target for NSAIDs.
Exposure to trichloroethene (TCE), a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, is known to induce autoimmunity both in humans and animal models. However, mechanisms underlying TCE-mediated autoimmunity remain largely unknown. Previous studies from our laboratory in MRL+/+ mice suggest that oxidative stress may contribute to TCE-induced autoimmune response. The current study was undertaken to further assess the role of oxidative stress in TCE-induced autoimmunity by supplementing with an antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Groups of female MRL+/+ mice were given TCE, NAC or TCE+NAC for 6 weeks (TCE, 10mmol/kg, i.p., every 4th day; NAC, 250mg/kg/day through drinking water). TCE exposure led to significant increases in serum levels of anti-nuclear, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies. TCE exposure also led to significant induction of anti-malondiadelhyde (MDA)- and anti-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-protein adduct antibodies which were associated with increased ANA in the sera along with increased MDA-/HNE-protein adducts in the livers and kidneys, and increases in protein oxidation (carbonylation) in the sera, livers and kidneys, suggesting an overall increase in oxidative stress. Moreover, TCE exposure also resulted in increased release of IL-17 from splenocytes and increases in IL-17 mRNA expression. Remarkably, NAC supplementation attenuated not only the TCE-induced oxidative stress, IL-17 release and mRNA expression, but also the markers of autoimmunity, as evident from decreased levels of ANA, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies in the sera. These results provide further support to a role of oxidative stress in TCE-induced autoimmune response. Attenuation of TCE-induced autoimmunity in mice by NAC provides an approach for preventive and/or therapeutic strategies.
Cataract was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) in 15-day-old Sprague-Dawley (Jcl: SD) rats. The threshold dose of MNU required for cataract induction in a 3-4 week time period was 70 mg/kg; 60 mg/kg was ineffective. Males and females were both equally affected. Mature cataract as confirmed histologically by degeneration, swelling, vacuolation, liquefaction of the lens fibers, and formation of Morgagni-like water vacuoles was seen in 80% (8/10), 70% (7/10) and 90% (9/10) of 100, 80 and 70 mg/kg MNU-treated rats, respectively, 4 weeks after dosing (43 days of age). At this time point, lens epithelial apoptosis was only rarely seen, but proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeled atypical nuclei with vacuolated lens fibers and macrophage migration were present within the injured lens. Cataracts were the only lesions induced by MNU and there were no other intra- or extraocular lesions seen. The dosing and timing schedule for the MNU administration in rats used in the present study is effective in rapidly causing cataract to occur.
Salvianolic acid A (SalA) is a phenolic carboxylic acid derivative extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza. It has many biological and pharmaceutical activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of SalA on concanavalin A (ConA)-induced acute hepatic injury in Kunming mice and to explore the role of SIRT1 in such an effect. The results showed that in vivo pretreatment with SalA significantly reduced ConA-induced elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities and decreased levels of the hepatotoxic cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Moreover, the SalA pretreatment ameliorated the increases in NF-κB and in cleaved caspase-3 caused by ConA exposure. Whereas, the pretreatment completely reversed expression of the B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). More importantly, the SalA pretreatment significantly increased the expression of SIRT1, a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, which was known to attenuate acute hypoxia damage and metabolic liver diseases. In our study, the increase in SIRT1 was closely associated with down-regulation of the p66 isoform (p66shc) of growth factor adapter Shc at both protein and mRNA levels. In HepG2 cell culture, SalA pretreatment increased SIRT1 expression in a time and dose-dependent manner and such an increase was abrogated by siRNA knockdown of SIRT1. Additionally, inhibition of SIRT1 significantly reversed the decreased expression of p66shc, and attenuated SalA-induced p66shc down-regulation. Collectively, the present study indicated that SalA may be a potent activator of SIRT and that SalA can alleviate ConA-induced hepatitis through SIRT1-mediated repression of the p66shc pathway.
Prolongation of the QT interval is associated with a high risk of serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias, usually torsade de pointes (TdP) polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, although monomorphic ventricular tachycardia may also develop. Both congenital and acquired forms have been reported, acquired forms being much more prevalent. An association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and a higher rate of dilated cardiomyopathy has also been recognized. The severity of immunodeficiency seems to influence both the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy. A higher prevalence of QT prolongation has been reported among hospitalized HIV-positive patients with HIV infection, possibly related to drugs prescribed for such patients or to an acquired form of long QT syndrome arising from HIV infection. We report a case of QT prolongation and development of ventricular arrhythmia in one HIV patient that started with intravenous clarithromycin and cotrimoxazole therapy.
Changes in intragastric pressure after the administration of suxamethonium 1.5 mg kg-1 i.v. were studied in 32 children (mean age 6.9 yr) pretreated with either physiological saline or alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1. The incidence and intensity of muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium were significantly greater in the control than in the alfentanil group. The intragastric pressure during muscle fasciculations was significantly higher in the control group (16 +/- 0.7 (SEM) cm H2O) than in the alfentanil group (7.7 +/- 1.5 (SEM) cm H2O). The increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of muscle fasciculations (regression line: y = 0.5 + 4.78x with r of 0.78). It is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium in healthy children. Alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1 effectively inhibits the incidence and intensity of suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations; moreover, intragastric pressure remains at its control value.
Environmental chemicals may be involved in the etiology of breast cancers. Many studies have addressed the association between cancer in humans and agricultural pesticide exposure. Organophosphorous pesticides have been used extensively to control mosquito plagues. Parathion and malathion are organophosphorous pesticides extensively used to control a wide range of sucking and chewing pests of field crops, fruits, and vegetables. They have many structural similarities with naturally occurring compounds, and their primary target of action in insects is the nervous system; they inhibit the release of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase at the synaptic junction. Eserine, parathion, and malathion are cholinesterase inhibitors responsible for the hydrolysis of body choline esters, including acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. Atropine, a parasympatholytic alkaloid, is used as an antidote to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to examine whether pesticides were able to induce malignant transformation of the rat mammary gland and to determine whether alterations induced by these substances increase the cholinergic activation influencing such transformation. These results showed that eserine, parathion, and malathion increased cell proliferation of terminal end buds of the 44-day-old mammary gland of rats, followed by formation of 8.6, 14.3, and 24.3% of mammary carcinomas, respectively, after about 28 months. At the same time, acetylcholinesterase activity decreased in the serum of these animals from 9.78 +/- 0.78 U/mL in the control animals to 3.05 +/- 0.06 U/mL; 2.57 +/- 0.15 U/mL; and 3.88 +/- 0.44 U/mL in the eserine-, parathion-, and malathion-treated groups, respectively. However, atropine alone induced a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the acetylcholinesterase activity from the control value of 9.78 +/- 0.78 to 4.38 +/- 0.10 for atropine alone, to 1.32 +/- 0.06 for atropine in combination with eserine, and 2.39 +/- 0.29 for atropine with malathion, and there was no mammary tumor formation. These results indicate that organophosphorous pesticides induce changes in the epithelium of mammary gland influencing the process of carcinogenesis, and such alterations occur at the level of nervous system by increasing the cholinergic stimulation.
Neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting side effect of vincristine sulfate. This study was designed to investigate neurotoxicity affecting the head and neck in a population of cancer patients receiving vincristine. Forty patients were given baseline interviews and oral examinations, and these were repeated weekly for the first 7 wk of treatment. Twenty-six patients (65%) developed symptoms of neurotoxicity: orofacial pain, 22/40 (55%); numbness 1/40 (2.5%); paresthesia 4/40 (10%); difficulty with mastication 1/40 (2.5%); involuntary movements 3/40 (7.5%); and voice changes, 4/40 (10%). Most symptoms occurred in the first week except voice changes (hoarseness and weakness) which did not occur until the third week of treatment. Using Fisher's exact test, neurotoxicity affecting the orofacial area was found to be significantly associated with younger age and single marital status indicating that psychosocial factors may affect susceptibility to the neurotoxic effects of vincristine. This prospective cohort study confirms previous anecdotal reports of vincristine neurotoxicity affecting the head and neck.
A number of microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-200 family, are aberrantly expressed in endometriosis and endometrial cancer. Here we assessed the expression and functional aspects of miR-200c in endometrial tissues (N = 52) from normal endometrial biopsies (N = 15), endometrial tissues including those exposed to hormonal therapies (N = 20), and grade I-III endometrial cancer (N = 17). miR-200c expression was elevated in normal endometrial biopsies from mid- and late-luteal phase, and in endometrial tumors as compared to endometrial tissues from peri- and postmenopausal period (P < .05) and its pattern of temporal expression displayed an inverse relationship with the expression of ZEBs. The expression of E-cadherin (CDH1) varied, but expressed at low levels, specifically in endometrial tissues and endometrial tumors. The endometrial expression of ZEBs and CDH1 in patients who were exposed to Depo-Provera and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist GnRHa displayed a trend toward lower expression as compared to proliferative phase; however, treatment of Ishikawa cells with 17β-estradiol, progesterone, and medroxy progesterone acetate had modest effects on the expression of miR-200c and ZEBs without affecting CDH1 expression. Gain of function of miR-200c in Ishikawa cells repressed ZEBs, as well as VEGFA, FLT1, IKKβ, and KLF9 expression at transcriptional and translational levels through direct interaction with their respective 3'untranslated regions and increased the rate of their proliferation. These results indicated that endometrial miR-200c expression undergoes dynamic changes during transition from normal into cancerous states; possibly influenced by hormonal milieu and by targeting the expression of specific genes with key regulatory functions in cellular transformation, inflammation, and angiogenesis may influence these events during normal and disease progression.
delta Subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors are located predominantly at nonsynaptic sites in the dentate gyrus where they may play important roles in controlling neuronal excitability through tonic inhibition and responses to GABA spillover. Immunohistochemical methods were used to determine whether delta subunit expression was altered after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in C57BL/6 mice in ways that could increase excitability of the dentate gyrus. In pilocarpine-treated animals, the normal diffuse labeling of the delta subunit in the dentate molecular layer was decreased by 4 d after status epilepticus (latent period) and remained low throughout the period of chronic seizures. In contrast, diffuse labeling of alpha4 and gamma2 subunits, potentially interrelated GABA(A) receptor subunits, was increased during the chronic period. Interestingly, delta subunit labeling of many interneurons progressively increased after pilocarpine treatment. Consistent with the observed changes in delta subunit labeling, physiological studies revealed increased excitability in the dentate gyrus of slices obtained from the pilocarpine-treated mice and demonstrated that physiological concentrations of the neurosteroid tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone were less effective in reducing excitability in the pilocarpine-treated animals than in controls. The findings support the idea that alterations in nonsynaptic delta subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors in both principal cells and interneurons could contribute to increased seizure susceptibility in the hippocampal formation in a temporal lobe epilepsy model.
Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have historically been documented as relatively rare complications of vancomycin monotherapy. Recent reports have linked aggressive vancomycin dosing strategies to significant risks of nephrotoxicity. We evaluated the rate of high-frequency hearing loss detected by audiometry for patients on vancomycin therapy. For this purpose, we used retrospective case-control analysis of audiometry results for patients on vancomycin therapy for whom baseline and follow-up exams were available. Analysis of 89 patients for whom audiograms were performed after an average of 27 days of vancomycin therapy showed a 12% rate of high-frequency hearing loss, with a trend in univariate analysis toward a higher rate with advanced age. The mean of the highest vancomycin trough levels for both patients with worsening audiograms and those without worsening audiograms was 19 mg/liter. Regression tree modeling demonstrated that for patients <53 years old, the rate of high-frequency hearing loss detected by audiogram was 0%, while for patients >53 years old, the incidence was 19% (P = 0.008). We conclude that a significant rate of high-frequency hearing loss in older patients receiving vancomycin monotherapy was detected by audiometry. While these data urge caution against continued indiscriminate vancomycin dose escalation to treat infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus strains for which vancomycin MICs are 2 mg/liter, further prospective studies are needed to determine the clinical significance and reversibility of these effects.
Although chronic administration of procymidone (a widely used dicarboximide fungicide) leads to an increased incidence of liver tumors in mice, short-term genotoxicity studies proved negative. As cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction has been linked to non-genotoxic carcinogenesis, we investigated whether procymidone administration causes induction of CYP-dependent monooxygenases in liver, kidney and lung microsomes of male Swiss Albino CD1 mice after single or repeated (daily for three consecutive days) i.p. treatment with either 400 or 800 (1/10 or 1/20 of the DL(50)) mgkg(-1) b.w. procymidone. CYP content and CYP3A1/2, 1A1, 1A2, 2B1/2, 2E1, 2A, 2D9 and 2C11 supported oxidations were studied using either the regio- and stereo-selective hydroxylation of testosterone as multibiomarker or highly specific substrates as probes of various CYPs. While a single dose was uneffective, multiple procymidone administration lead to marked inductions of various monooxygenases: CYP3A1/2 in liver and lung (as measured by N-demethylation of aminopyrine and testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase); CYP2E1 in liver (p-nitrophenol hydroxylation); CYP1A1 in liver and kidney (deethylation of ethoxyresorufin). Several hydroxylations were induced in the liver, including the CYP2A-linked 7 alpha (14-fold) as well as 6 alpha (22-fold), 6 beta, 16 beta and 2 beta hydroxylases. The pattern of inductions/suppressions recorded in the three different tissues suggests that procymidone exerts complex effects on the CYP profile. Tissue-specific trends included a large number of inductions in the liver and suppressions in the lung. The main inductions were corroborated by immunoblotting analyses and Northern blotting showed that inductions of CYP3A1/2, CYP2E1 and CYP1A1/2 were paralleled by increased mRNA levels. It was also found that CYP over-expression generates large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially in liver. These data may explain why in vitro short-term genotoxicity studies on procymidone were negative, whereas in vivo long-term carcinogenesis studies turned out positive: long-term CYP induction (e.g. oxygen centered free radicals over-production) can have a co-carcinogenic and/or promoting potential.
Excessive exposure to solar UVA and UVB radiation is widely considered to cause skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma and basalioma. Direct UVB damage to skin cell DNA as well as UV-induced chronic skin inflammation, accelerated keratinocyte proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and immunosuppression seem to underlie the UV-induced carcinogenesis. Also, UVB induces cytochrome P450 subfamilies (CYP1A1 and CYP1B1) involved in metabolic activation of organic pro-carcinogens and their conversion to ultimate carcinogens. Here, the effects of several glycosylated and non-glycosylated plant polyphenols (verbascoside, resveratrol, polydatin, rutin, and quercetin) on the inflammatory, apoptotic, metabolic, and proliferative responses of cultured human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) to non-cytotoxic doses of solar-simulated UVA+UVB and chemical mediators of UV signalling in HEK, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole and squalene isolated from photo-oxidized skin surface lipids (SSL), were evaluated. We showed that the stilbenes and quercetin being exposed to UV were photo-destroyed within a short period of time, while verbascoside and rutin were photo-stable. When SSL were exposed to UV, the stilbenes and quercetin remarkably accelerated photo-oxidation of alpha-tocopherol, squalene, and cholesterol fractions, whilst verbascoside protected them. Verbascoside invariably inhibited molecular pathways in HEK leading to inflammatory cytokine expression (NFkappaB and EGFR/ERK phosphorylation), and cell proliferation (EGFR nuclear translocation), and displayed a stimulus-specific effect on the metabolic axis aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-CYP1A1/CYP1B1. By contrast, the stilbenes inhibited UV-connected inflammatory cytokines excluding IL-8, but they prevalently stimulated NFkappaB, EGFR nuclear translocation and the AhR-CYP pathway. We conclude that, among the PPs investigated, verbascoside does interfere with multiple UV-sensitive signalling in HEK in a way that it could have a major impact on skin cancer chemoprevention.
The weight of evidence indicates that chloroform induces cancer in the female B6C3F1 mouse liver via a nongenotoxic-cytotoxic mode of action. However, it is probable that DNA damage occurs secondary to events associated with cytolethality and regenerative cell proliferation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential mutagenic activity of chloroform in the B6C3F1 lacI transgenic mouse liver mutagenesis assay including mutagenic events that might occur secondary to cytolethality. The positive control, dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) is a DNA-reactive mutagen and carcinogen. DMN-induced mutations were anticipated to require only a brief exposure and without further treatment were predicted to remain unchanged over time at those frequencies. Chloroform-induced mutations secondary to toxicity were anticipated to require longer exposure periods and to occur only under conditions that produced sustained cytolethality and regenerative cell proliferation. Female B6C3F1 lacI transgenic mice were treated with daily doses of 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg of DMN by gavage for 4 days and then held until analysis 10, 30, 90, and 180 days postexposure. Livers from DMN-treated mice exhibited a dose-related 2- to 5-fold increase over control mutant frequencies and remained at those levels for 10 through 180 days postexposure. Thus, following the initial induction by DMN no selective mutation amplification or loss was seen for this extended period of time. Female B6C3F1 lacI mice were exposed daily for 6 hr/day 7 days/week to 0, 10, 30, or 90 ppm chloroform by inhalation, representing nonhepatotoxic, borderline, or overtly hepatotoxic chloroform exposures. Timepoints for determination of lacI mutant frequency were 10, 30, 90, and 180 days of exposure. No increase in lacI mutant frequency in the liver was observed at any dose or timepoint with chloroform, indicating a lack of DNA reactivity. DNA alterations secondary to toxicity either did not occur or were of a type not detectable by lacI mutant frequency analysis, such as large deletions.
