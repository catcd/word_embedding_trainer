Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is the constitutive form of the COX enzyme family, which produces bioactive lipids called prostanoids. Although the role of COX-2 in liver diseases has been studied, little is known about the function of COX-1 in liver injury. We aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of COX-1 in acute liver injury. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) was administered to induce acute liver injury in wild-type or COX-1-deficient mice. Both genetic (partially or completely) deletion of COX-1 expression and pharmacological inhibition of COX-1 activity in mice exacerbated acute liver injury induced by CCl(4), revealing the (1) histopathological changes and increased serum levels of aminotransferases; (2) oxidative stress in the liver partly through the action of cytochrome P450 2E1-dependent pathway; (3) enhanced inflammatory and chemoattractive responses with increased number of activated macrophages; and (4) increased apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. These pathological changes were partly through the modulation of transcription factor-dependent pathways (eg, NF-κB and C/EBP-α). Pre-treatment with prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) or 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitor in homozygous COX-1 knockout mice significantly ameliorated CCl(4)-induced hepatic injury. In addition, level of hepato-protective molecules (eg, OSM and OSMR) and associated liver regeneration pathway were significantly inhibited by the deficiency of COX-1 but restored by the addition of PGE(2) or the inhibition of 5-LO. Furthermore, the alternative arachidonic acid metabolism pathway of 5-LO, which induced additional inflammation in the liver, was activated in response to the deficiency of COX-1. In conclusion, basal expression of COX-1 is essential for the protection of liver against chemical-induced hepatotoxicity and required for hepatic homeostatic maintenance.
Suxamethonium chloride (Sch) was administered i.v. to 36 adult males at six rates: 0.25 mg s-1 to 20 mg s-1. The infusion was discontinued either when there was no muscular response to tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve or when Sch 120 mg was exceeded. Six additional patients received a 30-mg i.v. bolus dose. Fasciculations in six areas of the body were scored from 0 to 3 and summated as a total fasciculation score. The times to first fasciculation, twitch suppression and tetanus suppression were inversely related to the infusion rates. Fasciculations in the six areas and the total fasciculation score were related directly to the rate of infusion. Total fasciculation scores in the 30-mg bolus group and the 5-mg s-1 and 20-mg s-1 infusion groups were not significantly different.
Acute organophosphate pesticide poisoning is a common medical emergency with high fatality in agricultural communities of Asia. Organophosphate compounds inhibit acetylcholinesterase and prolonged neuromuscular weakness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of poisoning. Organophosphate pesticide induced muscle weakness may not only arise from inhibition of acetylcholinesterase but also from non-cholinergic pathomechanisms, particularly mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting the production of sufficient ATP for muscle function. This study examined whether muscle weakness in rats subject to monocrotophos toxicity (0.8LD₅₀) was caused by inhibition of ATP synthesis, by oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, in addition to inhibition of muscle acetylcholinesterase. Severe muscle weakness in rats following monocrotophos administration was associated with inhibition of muscle acetylcholinesterase (30-60%) but not with reduced ATP production. The rats rapidly recovered muscle strength with no treatment. The ability of rats to spontaneously reactivate dimethoxy phosphorylated acetylcholinesterase and efficiently detoxify organophosphates may prevent severe inhibition of muscle acetylcholinesterase following acute severe monocrotophos poisoning. This may protect rodents against the development of prolonged muscle weakness induced by organophosphates.
The anticonvulsants diazepam (1-10 mg/kg) and phenobarbital (30-100 mg/kg) protected against lethality without altering clonic convulsions induced by 75 mg/kg cocaine (CD100) in male Swiss Webster mice. In contrast, the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, MK-801 (dizocilpine) and phencyclidine, produced dose-dependent protection against cocaine convulsions. The competitive NMDA antagonists, CPP and NPC 12626, were also anti-convulsant, without producing the behavioral disturbances associated with non-competitive antagonists. Diazepam and phenobarbital protected against convulsions induced by 60 mg/kg cocaine (90% convulsions alone). Compounds that act at the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor of the NMDA receptor complex, ACPC and 7-chlorokynurinic acid, also protected against convulsions induced by 60 mg/kg cocaine. In contrast, the non-opioid antitussive anticonvulsants (dextromethorphan, caramiphen, and carbetapentane) were not active against either dose of cocaine. The efficacy of compounds as antagonists of the convulsant effects of cocaine and NMDA appear related. These results suggest a potential role for the NMDA receptor complex in the convulsant actions of cocaine and new molecular targets for drug discovery in treating cocaine toxicity.
The initial results of partial ablation of vestibular function are evident to control vertigo attacks and stabilize hearing as well as to reduce the severity of ataxia. The purpose of this study is to observe the long-term results of low dose intramuscular streptomycin in the treatment of bilateral Menière's disease. Eleven patients with disabling bilateral Menière's disease were treated with low doses of intramuscular streptomycin (20-40 g, mean = 25 g). Follow-up was 5-12 years (mean = 8 yr). All 11 patients achieved relief of their disabling vertigo. One patient had recurrent vertigo 1 year after treatment and streptomycin perfusion of the labyrinth was performed subsequently. Four patients reported feeling slightly off balance during follow-up. None experienced oscillopsia in this series. In the entire group of 11 patients (22 ears), hearing was unchanged in 17 ears, improved in two and worse in three. A hearing threshold of < 30 dB was found in two ears before and two after treatment; 30-60 dB was found in seven ears before and six after treatment; and > 60 dB was found in 13 ears before and 14 after treatment. The mean PTA of the 22 ears was 58 dB before and 65.5 dB after treatment. The mean speech discrimination scores were 61.4 percent before and 51.3 percent after treatment. The long-term results suggest that partial ablation of vestibular function by streptomycin has long-lasting effects of controlling vertigo attacks, stabilizing hearing, and reducing the severity of ataxia. Administration of low doses of intramuscular streptomycin is the treatment of choice for bilateral Menière's disease.
The aim of the study was to describe a new and effective method for reconstructing small- and medium-sized oronasal communications in cases of deficient blood supply of oronasal mucosa.A male patient, aged 45, was presented with a hard palate defect due to chronic cocaine inhalation. The defect was corrected using bilateral Bichat bulla adipose flap and a Le Fort I osteotomy. The surgical technique was described, together with its advantages. Surgery lasted 2 hours. The reconstructive technique had been easy to execute. Six months after the surgery, the defect has been corrected without complications.Le Fort I osteotomy and the use of a bilateral Bichat bulla adipose flap is an effective technique to correct small- and medium-sized palatal defects not solvable with simple oral mucosa flaps. The technique is easy to execute and it showed a high efficacy with minimal impact on the patient's esthetic appearance.
Here we report the discovery of oncogenic mutations in the Hedgehog and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in over 80% of ameloblastomas, locally destructive odontogenic tumors of the jaw, by genomic analysis of archival material. Mutations in SMO (encoding Smoothened, SMO) are common in ameloblastomas of the maxilla, whereas BRAF mutations are predominant in tumors of the mandible. We show that a frequently occurring SMO alteration encoding p.Leu412Phe is an activating mutation and that its effect on Hedgehog-pathway activity can be inhibited by arsenic trioxide (ATO), an anti-leukemia drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that is currently in clinical trials for its Hedgehog-inhibitory activity. In a similar manner, ameloblastoma cells harboring an activating BRAF mutation encoding p.Val600Glu are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Our findings establish a new paradigm for the diagnostic classification and treatment of ameloblastomas.
Effective and well-tolerated anti-fibrotic drugs are currently lacking. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the potential anti-fibrotic effects of imatinib, nilotinib and silymarin on established hepatic fibrosis in the carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) rat model. Male Wistar rats received intraperitoneal injections of CCl(4) twice weekly for 8weeks, as well as daily intraperitoneal treatments of imatinib (10 and 20mg/kg), nilotinib (10 and 20mg/kg) and silymarin (100mg/kg) during the last 4weeks of CCl(4)-intoxication. At the end of the study, hepatic damage was evaluated by analysis of liver function tests and hepatic oxidative stress parameters. Hepatic fibrosis was evaluated by histopathology and morphometry, as well as collagen and 4-hydroxyproline contents. Nilotinib (20mg/kg) was the most effective treatment to counteract CCl(4)-induced hepatic injury as indicated by liver function tests and histopathology. Nilotinib (10mg/kg), nilotinib (20mg/kg) and silymarin (100mg/kg) treatments reduced the mean score of hepatic fibrosis by 31%, 68% and 47%, respectively, and hepatic collagen content by 47%, 49% and 18%, respectively in CCl(4)-treated rats. Hepatic morphometric evaluation and 4-hydroxyproline content revealed that CCl(4)-induced fibrosis was ameliorated significantly by nilotinib (20mg/kg) and imatinib (20mg/kg). Unlike nilotinib, imatinib (20mg/kg) showed some sort of hepatic injury evidenced by elevation of serum aminotransferases and total bilirubin levels, and hepatic total nitrate/nitrite content, as well as characteristic anisonucleosis visualized with the hematoxylin-eosin staining. In conclusion, this study provides the evidence that nilotinib exerts anti-fibrotic activity and suggests that it may be valuable in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis in humans.
To determine the genetic risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), this study examined 14 genetic variants from 10 hemostatic genes in 186 Taiwanese VTE patients and the same number of matched controls, which demonstrated FGA (encoding alpha fibrinogen) Thr312Ala polymorphism was the only variant significantly associated with VTE. Nine genetic polymorphisms on the fibrinogen cluster region of chromosome 4q28 were further studied, in which four FGA polymorphisms were found in strong linkage disequilibrium and were significantly associated with VTE by genotype and allele frequency analyses. Haplotype analysis showed significantly different FGA haplotype frequencies between VTE patients and controls with the haplotype F1, containing -1051G, -3A, 312Ala and TaqI duplication alleles, significantly associated with susceptibility to VTE (P = 0.001). Haplotype-pair analysis results also indicated a strong association of the haplotype-pair F1F1 with VTE in various VTE patient subgroups. In vitro functional analysis indicated that FGA -1051G, -3A and TaqI duplication alleles enhanced significantly the transcription level of FGA; however, control subjects with FGA genotypes containing these alleles had no elevated plasma fibrinogen levels. In conclusion, our experimental data indicated that functional genetic variants in FGA are risk factors for VTE in Taiwanese populations. Determination of FGA genotypes will likely contribute to primary prevention of this condition.
Hypoxia is defined as a deficiency of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body, and it plays a critical role in development and pathological conditions, such as cancer. Once tumors outgrow their blood supply, their central portion becomes hypoxic and the tumor stimulates angiogenesis through the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs are transcription factors that are regulated in an oxygen-dependent manner by a group of prolyl hydroxylases (known as PHDs or HPHs). Our understanding of hypoxia signaling is limited by our incomplete knowledge of HIF target genes. cDNA microarrays and a cell line lacking a principal HIF protein, HIF1alpha, were used to identify a more complete set of hypoxia-regulated genes. The microarrays identified a group of 286 clones that were significantly influenced by hypoxia and 54 of these were coordinately regulated by cobalt chloride. The expression profile of HIF1alpha -/- cells also identified a group of downregulated genes encoding enzymes involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress, offering an explanation for the increased sensitivity of HIF1alpha -/- cells to agents that promote this type of response. The microarray studies confirmed the hypoxia-induced expression of the HIF regulating prolyl hydroxylase, PHD2. An analysis of the members of the PHD family revealed that they are differentially regulated by cobalt chloride and hypoxia. These results suggest that HIF1alpha is the predominant isoform in fibroblasts and that it regulates a wide battery of genes critical for normal cellular function and survival under various stresses.
Ciprofloxacin-associated seizures (CAS) occur most commonly in patients with special risk factors that may cause accumulation of drug (high doses of the drug, old age, renal insufficiency, drug interactions) or that may decrease the threshold of epileptogenic activity (electrolyte abnormalities, history of seizures, electroconvulsive therapy).
To report thyrotoxicosis as a risk factor previously not heralded for the development of CAS.
A 24-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of convulsions, severe myopathy, and acute renal failure after taking ciprofloxacin for sinusitis, and urinary tract infections. Prior to ciprofloxacin ingestion, she had no seizure history, was not receiving any other medication, and her routine laboratory results including creatinine and electrolytes were within normal ranges. Electroencephalogram suggested epileptiform waves. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Further laboratory examinations documented thyrotoxicosis in association with postpartum thyroiditis.
In the reviewed literature, all cases of CAS occurred in the presence of at least one risk factor for CAS.
CAS appear to be restricted to individuals with predisposing risk factors, therefore it is always necessary to search such fact. When a physician encounters the possibility of CAS, in addition to previously described risk factors, thyrotoxicosis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Further, in patients with untreated thyrotoxicosis, antibiotics other than ciprofloxacin might be preferable for therapy.
Gastric cancer is the second most common fatal malignancy in the world. Proteomics studies of clinical tumor samples have led to the identification of specific protein markers of gastric cancer detection and better understanding the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer. Gastric cancer tissue of epithelial origin and adjacent normal mucosa were examined in pair by fluorescence 2-D differential in-gel electrophoresis proteomics analysis utilizing 2-D PAGE protein separation. Intensity changes of 33 spots were detected with statistical significance. Twenty-two out of the 33 spots were identified by MALDI-TOF MS or MS/MS. Of the 9 up-regulated proteins, 7 were identified, including heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), mutant desmin, effector cell proteinase receptor 1 splice form 1b, hypothetical protein, unnamed protein product, and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a protein similar to alpha-actin. Of the 20 down-regulated proteins, 16 were identified, including selenium binding protein 1, fibrinogen gamma, HSP27, tubulin alpha 6, zinc finger protein 160, prostaglandin F synthase, and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1. Our results suggest that MnSOD may be a potential serum marker for molecular diagnosis of gastric carcinoma, and DIGE is a useful technique for screening differentially expressed proteins in cancer tissues.
Skin cancer is increasing at an alarming rate and becoming resistant to conventional chemotherapy necessitating improved drug delivery system. We loaded apigenin (Ap), a dietary flavonoid having anti-cancer property, with poly (lactic-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NAp) to explore if nano-encapsulation could enhance anti-carcinogenic effect against ultra-violet B (UVB) and Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) induced skin tumor and mitochondrial dysfunction in mice. Particle size, morphology and zeta potential of NAp were determined using dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Tumor incidence and multiplicity in UVB-BaP induced mice with/without NAp treatment were ascertained and their histolopathological sections and chromosomal aberrations were studied. ROS accumulation and mitochondrial functioning through relevant markers like mitochondrial transmembrane potential were analyzed. Mitochondrial volume changes/swelling, cytochrome c (cyt c) release, mRNA and protein expressions of Apaf-1, bax, bcl-2, cyt c, cleaved caspase-9 and 3 were studied. Results showed that NAp produced better effects than Ap, due to their smaller size, and faster mobility. NAp reduced tissue damage and frequency of chromosomal aberrations, increased ROS accumulation to mediate mitochondrial-apoptosis through modulation of several apoptotic markers and mitochondrial matrix swelling. NAp showed ameliorative potentials in combating skin cancer and therefore has greater prospect of use in therapeutic management of skin cancer.
Current treatment strategies for percutaneous coronary revascularization and acute coronary syndromes incorporate thrombin inhibition with either unfractionated or fractionated heparin. The peptide bivalirudin (Hirulog) is a direct thrombin inhibitor whose pharmacological properties differ from those of heparin. We conducted a systematic overview (meta-analysis) to assess the effect of bivalirudin on 4 end points: death, myocardial infarction, major hemorrhage, and the composite of death or infarction.
Six trials (5674 patients) represent the randomized, controlled bivalirudin experience, including 4603 patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary revascularization and 1071 patients with acute coronary syndromes. ORs for the 4 clinical end points were calculated for each trial. Four trials (4973 patients) that compared bivalirudin with heparin were combined with the use of a random-effects model. In these trials, bivalirudin was associated with a significant reduction in the composite of death or infarction (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.95; P=0.02) at 30 to 50 days, or 14 fewer events per 1000 patients so treated. There also was a significant reduction in major hemorrhage for the same trials (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0. 32 to 0.52; P<0.001, or 58 fewer events per 1000 patients so treated). A similar analysis combined 2 dose-ranging trials (701 patients) that compared therapeutic (activated partial thromboplastin time more than twice the control time) with subtherapeutic bivalirudin anticoagulation (activated partial thromboplastin time less than twice the control time).
Bivalirudin is at least as effective as heparin, with clearly superior safety. Thus, it provides an unprecedented net clinical benefit over heparin in patients with ischemic heart disease.
Lead (Pb) was one of the first poisons identified, and the developing nervous system is particularly vulnerable to its toxic effects. Relatively low, subclinical doses, of Pb that produce no overt signs of encephalopathy can affect cognitive, emotional, and motor functions. In the present study, the effects of developmental Pb-exposure on behavioral performance and gene expression in BALB/cAnNTac mice were evaluated. Pups were exposed to Pb from gestational-day (gd) 8 to postnatal-day (pnd) 21 and later evaluated in exploratory behavior, rotarod, Morris water maze, and resident-intruder assays as adults. Pb-exposure caused significant alterations in exploratory behavior and water maze performance during the probe trial, but rotarod performance was not affected. Pb-exposed males displayed violent behavior towards their cage mates, but not to a stranger in the resident-intruder assay. Gene expression analysis at pnd21 by microarray and qRT-PCR was performed to provide a molecular link to the behavior changes that were observed. Pb strongly up-regulated gene expression within the signaling pathways of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extra-cellular matrix (ECM) receptor, focal adhesion, and vascular endothelial growth-factor (VEGF), but Pb down-regulated gene expression within the pathways for glycan structures-biosynthesis 1, purine metabolism, and N-glycan biosynthesis. Pb increased transcription of genes for major histocompatibility (MHC) proteins, the chemokine Ccl28, chemokine receptors, IL-7, IL7R, and proteases. The qRT-PCR analysis indicated an increase of gene expression in the whole brain for caspase 1 and NOS2. Analysis of IL-1β, caspase 1, NOS2, Trail, IL-18 and IL-33 gene expression of brain regions indicated that Pb perturbed the inter-regional expression pattern of pro-inflammatory genes. Brain region protein concentrations for IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, showed a significant decrease only within the cortex region. Results indicate that Pb differentially affects the behavior of male and female mice in that females did less exploration and the males were selectively more aggressive. Gene expression data pointed to evidence of neuroinflammation in the brain of both female and male mice. Pb had more of an effect in the males on expression of vomeronasal receptor genes associated with odor detection and social behavior.
Overactive AMPA receptor-mediated transmission may be involved in the pathogenesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The mechanism of action of the anticonvulsant drug topiramate involves attenuation of AMPA receptor-mediated transmission. In this study, the potential antidyskinetic action of topiramate was examined in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset model of Parkinson's disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Topiramate significantly reduced levodopa-induced dyskinesia, without affecting the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa. Topiramate represents an exciting potential novel therapeutic approach to levodopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease.
In this double-blind, parallel, single-dose study, bitolterol mesylate aerosol (three sprays, 1.11 mg) and albuterol aerosol (two sprays, 180 mcg) were compared for efficacy of bronchodilation in 120 adolescent and young adult patients with moderate to severe asthma. All patients required regular medications for asthma control. None was steroid dependent. Both medications gave effective bronchodilation within 5 min with maximum effect at 30 to 60 min. Mean percent increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) over baseline was higher for bitolterol than for albuterol at all test times up to 8 hr after a dose at which time 20% mean percent increase of FEV1 over baseline was still present in the bitolterol-treated patients. With albuterol mean percent increase in FEV1 fell to 15% over baseline at 5 hr after a dose. Differences in FEV1 increase between the two treatment groups were statistically significant at 4 to 8 hr after a dose. Patients with baseline FEV1 less than 50% of predicted normal had a response to bitolterol that was higher than that observed with albuterol treatment (p less than 0.1). Mean maximum percent increase in FEV1 and median duration of bronchodilation were greater with bitolterol than with albuterol, but the differences were not statistically significant. Both bitolterol aerosol and albuterol aerosol were demonstrated to be safe, effective, and long-acting bronchodilating agents. Both bitolterol and albuterol administered by aerosol had a rapid onset, and the maximum degree of bronchodilation was comparable. However, at the doses studied, bitolterol produced significantly higher increase in FEV1 over baseline at longer times after medication than did albuterol.
Currently, complete surgical resection is the only curative option for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Previous work has shown the Notch pathway is a potent tumor suppressor in MTC and that resveratrol activates the Notch pathway in carcinoid cancer, a related neuroedocrine malignancy. In this study, we hypothesized that the effects observed on carcinoid cells could be extended to MTC.
MTC cells treated with varying doses of resveratrol were assayed for viability by the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. Western blot analysis for achaete-scute complex-like 1 (ASCL1), chromogranin A (CgA), full-length and cleaved caspase 3, and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) was performed. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to measure relative mRNA expression.
Treatment with resveratrol resulted in growth suppression and an increase in the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. A dose-dependent inhibition of ASCL1, a neuroedocrine transcription factor, was observed at the protein and mRNA levels. Protein levels of CgA, a marker of hormone secretion, were also reduced after treatment with resveratrol. A dose-dependent induction of Notch2 mRNA was observed by qPCR.
Resveratrol suppresses in vitro growth, likely through apoptosis, as demonstrated by cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. Furthermore, resveratrol decreased neuroedocrine markers ASCL1 and chromogranin A. Induction of Notch2 mRNA suggests that this pathway may be central in the anti-MTC effects observed.
Clinical and pulmonary function changes induced by intravenous dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorvinyldimethyl phosphate) (DDVP) toxicosis, and reversibility of these changes after atropine treatment were investigated in six Friesian calves one to three months old. From one minute after dosage, all animals showed severe respiratory distress, excitation, weakness, muscle fasciculation and cholinesterase inhibition. Decrease in dynamic lung compliance and arterial oxygen tension and increase in total pulmonary resistance, viscous work of breathing and alveolar arterial oxygen gradient were highly significant (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, body secretions, heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume and arterial carbon dioxide tension were not significantly affected by DDVP injection. Atropine promptly and completely reversed these changes, except for muscle fasciculations, central depression and cholinesterase inhibition which disappeared progressively within 24 hours.
The primary objective of this study was to determine whether concurrent treatments with a low dose of the dopamine D(3)-preferring receptor agonist 7-OH-DPAT would attenuate the development of behavioral sensitization to the indirect dopamine receptor agonist, cocaine, or the direct dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine. In two experiments, male Wistar rats (250-350 g) were given seven daily injections of 7-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg sc) or vehicle in combination with either cocaine (15 mg/kg ip), apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg sc), or vehicle. After the injections, the rats were tested for activity in photocell arenas for 40 min, and three measures of motor behavior (distance traveled, rearing, and stereotypy) were recorded at 10-min intervals. A total of 24 h after the last preexposure session, all rats were given a challenge injection of either cocaine (10.0 mg/kg ip, Experiment 1) or apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg sc, Experiment 2) and tested for activity. Major findings were as follows: (a) 7-OH-DPAT treatments alone suppressed all measures of locomotor activity and did not affect subsequent behavioral sensitivity to either cocaine or apomorphine; (b) cocaine treatments acutely increased all measures of activity, and repeated treatments produced behavioral sensitization to the horizontal locomotor-activating effects of cocaine; (c) apomorphine treatments alone increased horizontal activity and stereotypy but completely abolished rearing behavior; (d) like cocaine, repeated treatments with apomorphine induced behavioral sensitization; (e) concurrent treatments of 7-OH-DPAT with cocaine acutely attenuated cocaine-induced increases in motor behavior but enhanced the development of behavioral sensitization to cocaine; and (f) concurrent 7-OH-DPAT treatments did not significantly affect either the acute or chronic effects of apomorphine. It is evident from these results that concurrent treatment with 7-OH-DPAT does not block the development of behavioral sensitization to either cocaine or apomorphine. Moreover, the differential acute and chronic effects of 7-OH-DPAT on cocaine- and apomorphine-induced hyperactivity appear to be mediated by dopamine autoreceptor stimulation.
A number of effective topical therapies are available for the treatment of tinea versicolor (TV). However, topical antifungals are difficult to apply to a large body surface area and for this reason TV is perhaps more easily treated with systemic agents.
A total of 128 patients with TV, aged 15-55 years, were entered into a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing the efficacy and tolerance of two regimens of oral treatment for TV. The patients were randomly divided in two groups: group 1 received two 150 mg capsules of fluconazole in a single dose repeated weekly for 2 weeks; and group 2 received two 200 mg tablets of ketoconazole in a single dose repeated weekly for 2 weeks. Diagnosis of TV was made clinically by direct KOH preparation and Wood's lamp examination.
Of 128 patients, 100 completed the study and no major side-effects were noted between the two treatment regimens. Results of the study showed no significant differences in efficacy, safety and tolerability between the two treatment regimens. The maximal cure rate was achieved at 8 weeks from the start of treatment and decreased slightly afterwards.
Fluconazole and ketoconazole demonstrated similar efficacy in the treatment of TV. We also demonstrated a lack of correlation between mycological cure and hypopigmentation at the end of treatment (2 weeks) and the usefulness of Wood's lamp examination in detecting cure of TV.
Systemic side effects caused by parenteral pentamidine are frequent. They can be severe and life-threatening. Intravenous pentamidine may cause a variety of abnormalities in the cardiac conduction system as tachyarrhythmias, hypotension and/or non-specific ECG changes (a long corrected QT interval). There is only one case of previously reported bradyarrhythmias in an HIV-infected patient. We present a new adverse effect associated with intravenous pentamidine therapy, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of sinus bradycardia in a patient who is not HIV-infected.
Only a small proportion of subjects exposed to isocyanates develop occupational asthma, suggesting individual predisposition. The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules may play a crucial role in the development of the immune response to isocyanates.
To investigate the role of HLA class II molecules in the development of toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced asthma.
Sixty-seven asthmatic subjects and 27 asymptomatic exposed subjects (controls) were typed at the HLA class II DQA1, DQB1 and DRB1 loci by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques.
The frequencies of DQA1*0104 and DQB1*0503 were significantly increased in asthmatics compared with asymptomatic exposed subjects, while DQA1*0101 and DQB1*0501 were significantly increased in asymptomatic exposed subjects. No significant difference was found in the distribution of DRB1 alleles between asthmatics and controls.
The results of this study indicate that HLA-regulated immune mechanisms are involved in TDI-induced asthma and that, in exposed subjects, specific factors may increase or decrease the risk of developing disease.
Neither intrathecal methotrexate nor posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome has previously been reported to result in mesial temporal sclerosis. Described here is the case of a boy with no risk factors for mesial temporal sclerosis who presented with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and partial complex seizures 8 days after initiation of intrathecal methotrexate for treatment of Burkitt lymphoma, and who ultimately progressed to intractable temporal lobe epilepsy due to left mesial temporal sclerosis.
Enantiomer-specific high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection using 4-(4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-benzoyl chloride as a fluorescence labeling reagent was applied to determine methamphetamine and its metabolites in abusers' hair and urine. Hair samples were segmentally analyzed based on 1 cm long segments. In four hair samples, only the S(+)-enantiomers of methamphetamine and its N-demethylated metabolite, S(+)-amphetamine were detected. Satisfactory correlation (r = 0.901) between the results of high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence and those of gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorous detection was obtained (n = 19). In an abuser's urine sample, the S(+)- and R(-)-enantiomers of methamphetamine, amphetamine and para-hydroxymethamphetamine were detected. The degree of N-demethylation of S(+)-methamphetamine into the corresponding metabolite of amphetamine was significantly higher than that of the R(-)-enantiomer.
