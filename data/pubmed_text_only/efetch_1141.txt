The myopathy caused by zidovudine (AZT) appears to be common but is incompletely characterized, particularly regarding prognosis. Twenty patients with HIV infection developed a necrotizing myopathy while taking AZT for 9 to 30 months. Ten presented with myalgia and 17 with proximal muscle weakness. Serum CK was elevated in all (two to 11 times normal), and EMG suggested active myopathy in all but two. There were scattered granular degenerating fibers, with scant or no inflammation, in a pattern consistent with a toxic myopathy in all 18 patients biopsied. Three patients with an HIV-related inflammatory myopathy were distinguished by histologic differences. After stopping AZT (n = 15), myalgia promptly resolved (10 of 10). Strength improved more slowly with 12 of 15 regaining normal or nearly normal strength, but three have persistent weakness. CK returned to normal in 12 of 15, and follow-up EMG (n = 11) documented reduced fibrillation density in all 11 patients. These findings underscore the need for early diagnosis of this reversible myopathy.
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is the leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the US and the most common adverse event causing drug non-approval and drug withdrawal by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Three different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been withdrawn in the UK and/or the US due to hepatotoxicity (bromfenac, ibufenac, and benoxaprofen). A systematic review of clinical trials data for these drugs was performed in an effort to identify possible early signals that could have predicted post-marketing serious hepatoxicity. There were very limited published data on benoxaprofen and none on ibufenac or bromfenac. The publicly accessible archives of the FDA provided information on bromfenac. Flu-like symptoms associated with hepatic enzyme elevation and a case of possible drug-related hepatocellular jaundice may in retrospect have been signals for serious hepatotoxicity in the database of 1195 subjects reviewed by the FDA. Following approval, rates of acute liver failure for bromfenac were estimated to be in the range of 1:10 000. In addition, the safety databases of several drugs also accessed through FDA archives have been reviewed (simvastatin, tacrine, troglitazone, and ximelagatran). These data suggest that while ALT elevations alone do not reliably signal serious hepatotoxicity, elevated transaminases in association with symptomatic hepatitis or jaundice may be predictors of an increased risk of ALF. At present, however, pre-approval databases are generally not large enough to rule out low rates of serious hepatotoxicity. Therefore, it remains critical that clinicians report such cases to the FDA through the MEDWATCH system and that active post-marketing monitoring studies be used to identify potential rare cases of hepatotoxicity.
The effects of administration of 1-amyl-1-nitrosourea (ANU) at doses of 400, 200, 100 and 0 ppm in the drinking water to Donryu rats of both sexes were studied. Tumors developed in 166/205 (81%) rats that received ANU, as compared with 9/34 (27%) control rats. The incidence of digestive tract tumors was highest (76%), followed by hematopoietic tissue (11%) and liver (9%) tumors. In females, mammary tumors were also found. There appeared to be a dose-response relationship among the 3 treated groups as regards the incidence of tumors of the hematopoietic tissues and the average survival time.
A ventricular tachycardia (VT) with right bundle branch block (RBBB) QRS morphology and left axis originating from the inferoapical segment of the left ventricle is described in a 49-year-old man without structural heart disease. This VT could be initiated during isoproterenol infusion and was terminated with intravenous administration of adenosine and verapamil. Radiofrequency ablation eliminated the tachycardia. Previous reports have suggested reentry as the mechanism for a verapamil-sensitive VT with this ECG morphology, while cAMP-mediated triggered activity has been proposed as a mechanism for VTs sensitive to adenosine. The latter more typically arise in the right ventricular outflow tract. The electrophysiological and electropharmacological characteristics of the tachycardia in this patient suggest that this VT morphology is not specific for a mechanism but rather for the location of the site of origin.
Two depressive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cerebral infarction, while being treated with corticosteroid, are described. In both cases, lithium was remarkably effective and no severe side-effects occurred. These findings suggest that lithium can be a useful antidepressant agent in the treatment of depressive SLE patients.
Acetaminophen, a monocyclic phenolic compound and analgesic, when fed at 8900 p.p.m. in the diet, was reported to inhibit the hepatocarcinogenicity in rats of the aromatic amine proximate carcinogen N-hydroxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene. To elucidate the mechanism(s) of this anticarcinogenicity, the present study examined whether acetaminophen at lower doses has the ability to inhibit the initiating effects in the rat liver of the precursor hepatocarcinogen N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene. Male F344 rats were allocated to six groups, which were maintained under reverse light cycle conditions to assure acetaminophen ingestion at the time of N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene administration during the dark phase, which was imposed from 07.00 to 19.00 h. Group 1 served as vehicle control (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose) for N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene, which was administered intragastrically 3 days per week at 2.6 mg/kg for 8 weeks (group 4) to achieve initiation. Acetaminophen was given in the diet either alone at 2400 or 4800 p.p.m. for 9 weeks (groups 2 and 3), or with N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (groups 5 and 6), starting 1 week before N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene administration. Acetaminophen blood levels were about 1 and 4 microg/ml at the two dietary concentrations. N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene induced hepatocellular preneoplastic lesions measured as hepatocellular altered foci expressing glutathione S-transferase-P, reflecting initiation. Induced foci were reduced with administration of both concentrations of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen by itself produced no DNA adducts nor did it alter the high formation of N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene-DNA adducts, about 200 in 10 nucleotides, measured by nucleotide postlabeling. Acetaminophen did not affect background liver cell proliferation, but significantly reduced N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene-induced increased proliferation measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunostaining. Thus, acetaminophen effectively protected hepatocytes from the initiating effects of N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene, possibly through a cytoprotective effect resulting from slowing the rate of induced cell turnover.
Leptin, a circulating hormone secreted mainly from adipose tissues, is involved in the control of body weight. The plasma concentrations are correlated with body mass index, and are reported to be high in patients with insulin resistance, which is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, the direct effect of leptin on vascular wall cells is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of leptin on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). We found that leptin increases ROS generation in BAEC in a dose-dependent manner and that its effects are additive with those of glucose. Rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), Mn(III)tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP), uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) HVJ-liposomes, or manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) HVJ-liposomes completely prevented the effect of leptin, suggesting that ROS arise from mitochondrial electron transport. Leptin increased fatty acid oxidation by stimulating the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) and inhibiting that of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), pace-setting enzymes for fatty acid oxidation and synthesis, respectively. Leptin-induced ROS generation, CPT-1 activation, ACC inhibition, and MCP-1 overproduction were found to be completely prevented by either genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, H-89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, or tetradecylglycidate, a CPT-1 inhibitor. Leptin activated PKA, and the effects of leptin were inhibited by the cAMP antagonist Rp-cAMPS. These results suggest that leptin induces ROS generation by increasing fatty acid oxidation via PKA activation, which may play an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis in insulin-resistant obese diabetic patients.
The mechanism of beta-blocker induced cardiotoxicity is poorly understood. One possible explanation is that beta-blockers induce ion dyshomeostasis, resulting in cardiac hyperpolarization. The intent of this study was to determine if modifying extracellular ions would reverse cardiotoxicity from two beta-blockers: propranolol (PROP) and atenolol (ATEN). Two treatments were studied: low extracellular K+ and high extracellular Na+. Isolated rat hearts were perfused on a Langendorff apparatus with Krebs-Henseleit- Bicarbonate buffer (KHB) solution. Toxicity (Tox) was induced by perfusing hearts for 30 min with KHB + PROP [5 microgram/ml] or KHB + ATEN [2.5 mg/ml]. Subsequently, hearts were perfused with KHB containing either PROP or ATEN, but modified by lowering K+ [2.3 mM] or raising Na+ [160 mM] for a 30-min treatment (Tx) period. Hearts were paced near the end of treatment. Cardiodynamics were monitored via a balloon-tipped catheter in the left ventricle. The first derivative of LV pressure (dP/dt) with respect to time served as our index of myocardial performance. Tx groups were as follows: (1) KHB only, (2) PROP only, (3) PROP + K, (4) PROP + Na, (5) ATEN only, (6) ATEN 4 K, and (7) ATEN + Na. PROP induced negative chronotropic effects and rendered the hearts refractory to pacing. ATEN demonstrated similar chronotropic toxicity plus decreased myocardial contractility. Tx with low extracellular K+ and high extracellular Na+ increased HR and restored the ability to pace, thereby reversing toxicity. These data suggest that beta-blocker toxicity is mediated via hyperpolarization.
Second- and third-generation cephalosporins, notably cefotetan, are increasingly implicated in severe, sometimes fatal immunemediated hemolytic anemia. We describe a 26-year-old woman who developed severe hemolytic anemia 2 weeks after receiving a single prophylactic dose of cefotetan during cesarean delivery. The patient's DAT was weakly reactive for IgG and her serum reacted with cefotetan-coated RBCs. The antibody had a titer of 4,096 by antiglobulin testing. The patient required treatment with two units of PRBCs and experienced gradual resolution of hemolysis. Our case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of delayed onset hemolytic anemia following prophylactic use of cefotetan.
Pararenal angiosarcomas appear in CBA male mice treated with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). No such tumours appeared in the intact females treated with DMH alone. Testosterone propionate (TP) given in combination with DMH (28%) was efficient in the incidence of DMH-induced pararenal tumours in females. Pararenal angiosarcomas appeared in 92% of castrated CBA female mice under combined treatment with DMH and TP. No such tumours appeared in C57B1 males treated under the same experimental conditions.
Severe side effects of chemotherapy in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are rare, but well-known. We present two pediatric patients who developed ascending motoric paraplegia (AMP) following intrathecal chemotherapy. Both patients suffered from progressive weakness of their lower extremities, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, autonomous neural dysregulation and minor sensory deficits. Despite an initially similar clinical picture, progression and outcome were fairly different. There is convincing evidence that AMP is caused by spinal cord toxicity of intrathecally applied toxic agents such as cytarabin and/or methotrexate leading to spinal demyelinisation as demonstrated by elevated myelin basic protein in cerebrospinal fluid.
Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina occurred in a diethylstilbestrol (DES)-exposed patient in the fourth year of continuous observation for adenosis. Diagnosis was suspected by digital and colposcopic examination and confirmed by target biopsy. Cytology was negative. The development of malignancy in a patient who has been known to have adenosis has been previously described but is very rare. The necessity for careful regular follow-up using cytology, digital palpation, and colposcopy at 6-month intervals is emphasized.
An antibiotic once used to treat traveler's diarrhea might battle Alzheimer's disease as well, researchers announced here last week at the Society for Neuroscience's annual meeting. The drug dissolves Alzheimer's-like plaques in mouse brains, apparently by trapping the copper and zinc that stud these deposits. A clinical trial to test whether the drug helps people with Alzheimer's is already under way.
The ocular complications of long-term amiodarone therapy have been recognized for many years, but systematic data on the prognostic significance and the precise incidence of such effects have not been evaluated until recently. One hundred seventy-five patients receiving long-term amiodarone treatment have thus been followed for periods ranging from 3 months to nearly 10 years. Of 103 of these patients studied in greater depth, 98% have shown the characteristic patterns of corneal microdeposits, which progressed over several months and ultimately formed a stable appearance that changed only with an alteration of dose. The abnormalities, the nature of which is not clearly understood, disappeared within 7 months in the 16 patients whose drug was withdrawn for unrelated reasons, and no permanent ocular damage has been detected. Visual symptoms associated with the corneal deposits developed in 6% of patients: 3% had photophobia, 2% halos, and 1% blurring of vision but without impairment of visual acuity. It is concluded that ocular complications of amiodarone therapy are insignificant; they do not pose a threat to vision, and routine ophthalmologic surveillance does not appear mandatory in the majority of patients during long-term drug therapy.
The production of oxygen-free radicals has been proposed as a determinant of the delayed toxicity of doxorubicin. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the potential cardioprotective effect of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) against the delayed cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (DXR) in a rat model. Female Sprague Dawley rats received 3 mg/kg of DXR intravenously weekly for 4 weeks. SOD or CAT were administered intravenously at the dose of 10000 U/kg 2 min before and 30 min after each DXR administration. Cardiac toxicity was monitored by means of electrocardiography (QaT interval) and by light and electron microscopy evaluation of left ventricle fragments. DXR treated rats showed, in comparison with control animals, a decrease of body weight gain, a progressive and irreversible prolongation of QaT and significant morphologic lesions consisting in myocyte vacuolization and myofibrillar loss. SOD significantly prevented the impairment of body weight gain and QaT prolongation. Moreover, morphologic lesions were significantly reduced in rats receiving DXR + SOD. On the contrary, CAT seems to be completely devoid of protective effect.
With the increasing use of amiodarone, several unwanted effects have been recognized. We reviewed 140 patients treated with amiodarone over a 5-year period in an attempt to identify patients at risk, to assess the incidence of these effects and their possible relation to dose, and to determine their outcome. The most common effect was photosensitivity (57% of patients responding to a questionnaire), whereas asymptomatic corneal microdeposits were found in all patients undergoing ophthalmologic examination. In contrast, symptomatic eye changes (colored halos) and slate-gray skin pigmentation were rare. Of the metabolic alterations, the rise in hepatic enzymes correlated with dose and plasma drug and metabolite concentrations (r = 0.59, p less than 0.001; r = 0.62, p less than 0.001, respectively) but was not associated with clinical disease. This relation to dose was not evident in patients developing clinical thyroid abnormalities (two hypothyroidism, two hyperthyroidism), all of whom had normal thyroid function prior to therapy. Four of the five hypothyroid patients were over 70 years of age. No patients developed peripheral neuropathy, but tremor and sleeplessness were common complaints (30% and 28% of patients, respectively) that responded to a decrease in dose. One patient with an abnormal chest x-ray film prior to therapy developed pulmonary fibrosis. We suggest the restricted use of high doses of amiodarone for protracted periods. Patients at particular risk are the older age group (hypothyroidism) and those with abnormal lung function prior to therapy who may be predisposed to pulmonary alveolitis. Most of the observed unwanted effects resolve when amiodarone is decreased in dose or discontinued.
Optic neuritis, a well known adverse effect of ethambutol, is related to the dose and duration of the therapy. The patient described here developed rapidly progressive deterioration of vision after only 3 days of treatment with ethambutol. Such a case has not been reported before and it is suspected that this was an idiosyncratic reaction.
A young patient without history of epilepsy developed a pronounced motor reaction simulating an epileptic attack in response to diprivan. Possible causes of motor excitation in response to diprivan and probability of their prediction are discussed.
We assessed the feasibility and pharmacokinetics of high-dose infusional paclitaxel in combination with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and peripheral blood progenitor cell rescue. Between October 1995 and June 1998, 63 patients with high-risk primary [stage II with >or= 10 axillary nodes involved, stage IIIA or stage IIIB inflammatory carcinoma (n = 53)] or with stage IV responsive breast cancer (n = 10) received paclitaxel 150-775 mg/m(2)infused over 24 hours, doxorubicin 165 mg/m(2)as a continuous infusion over 96 hours, and cyclophosphamide 100 mg kg(-1). There were no treatment-related deaths. Dose-limiting toxicity was reversible, predominantly sensory neuropathy following administration of paclitaxel at the 775 mg/m(2) dose level. Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics were non-linear at higher dose levels; higher paclitaxel dose level, AUC, and peak concentrations were associated with increased incidence of paraesthesias. No correlation between stomatitis, haematopoietic toxicities, and paclitaxel dose or pharmacokinetics was found. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 30-month event-free and overall survival for patients with primary breast carcinoma are 65% (95% CI; 51-83%) and 77% (95% CI; 64-93%). Paclitaxel up to 725 mg/m(2) infused over 24 hours in combination with with doxorubicin 165 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 100 mg kg(-1) is tolerable. A randomized study testing this regimen against high-dose carboplatin, thiotepa and cyclophosphamide (STAMP V) is currently ongoing.
From 1979 to 1986, 500 women were enrolled in a New York State regional diethylstilbestrol (DES) clinic for the early detection of DES-associated adenocarcinoma of the cervix or vagina. Only 66 DES-exposed females were seen at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in the 6-year period prior to the establishment of the DES screening clinic. Most (40%) learned of the DES screening clinic through television public service announcements. Documentation by physician, pharmacy, or hospital records of intrauterine DES exposure was possible in only 15.2% of the cases. Because of a mean age of 24 years of the DES-exposed patients, most physician, pharmacy, and hospital records were not readily available from that time period. In 5.2% of the patients enrolled in the DES clinic, review documented that the mother had not taken DES or other synthetic estrogen analogs. Among the 474 evaluable DES patients, gross vaginal or cervical abnormalities were present in 13.5% and DES-associated adenosis was seen in 16.0%. Sixteen (3.4%) developed squamous dysplasia, one developed squamous in situ carcinoma of the cervix, and one developed invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. During the 6-year period of the DES screening clinic, no patient developed DES-associated adenocarcinoma of the cervix or vagina. The utility of such specialized clinics is discussed.
The present study characterizes the biochemical, morphological, and histological sites of CCNU-induced hepatotoxicity and investigates the effect of modifiers of drug metabolism on this toxicity. A single oral dose (100 mg/kg) of CCNU caused four- and ninefold increases in serum GOT and GPT respectively 48 h after administration in rats. A 25-fold rise in serum bilirubin, a total loss of bile flow, and a decrease in BSP clearance were also observed. Cytochrome P-450 content and EM-N-demethylase activity were significantly decreased to 88% and 66% of control values respectively. A histopathological time course study of CCNU-induced injury showed a progression of acute inflammation, edema, and fibrin deposition in portal areas over 24 h with necrosis and sloughing of bile duct epithelium at 24 and 36 h. Treatment of rats with PB (40 mg/kg/day for 4 days, i.p.) 24 h prior to CCNU administration protected against CCNU-induced hepatotoxicity. Thus, the levels of serum GOT, GPT, and bilirubin were only 2.5 and 4 times higher than in untreated or PB-treated controls. Histopathological examination also showed reduced severity of bile duct lesions in PB-pretreated animals. In rats receiving both PB and CCNU, bile flow was restored and BSP clearance was increased compared to the CCNU-treated rats. The mixed-function oxidase activity in PB + CCNU-treated rats was not significantly different from that in PB-treated controls. It is concluded that pretreatment of rats with PB can markedly suppress the hepatotoxic manifestations, including histopathological changes, the rise in serum bilirubin, and the cholestasis observed in CCNU-treated rats.
Recent immunologic and microbiologic evidence suggests that urothelial tumors may be caused by "C" type oncogenic viruses. Such viruses may exert their oncogenic potential in responce to stimulation by known chemical carcinogens. By means of a unique enzyme, reverse transcriptase, these viruses are able to incorporate genetic information into that of the host, and can thereby be transmitted vertically from generation to generation. An evaluation of the specific antiviral agents dimethylbenzyldemethl-rifampicin and streptovaricin-comples, which inhibit the enzyme reverse transcriptase, revealed no depay in the induction of bladder tumors by the chemical carcinogen, 2-formylamino-4-(5-nitro-2-furyl) thiazole (FANFT) in C3H mice. This observation suggests that the reproduction and release of virus may not be essential in the malignant transformation of bladder epithelial cells, but does not preclude the possiblity that inherited viral genetic information may be involved in the oncogenesis of bladder tumors.
Case report of a iatrogenic benign intracranial hypertension in a 7 months old infant. Unlike in the child and the adult, this syndrome has a peculiar non specific clinical pattern in the infant. Having ruled out other specific acute diseases of the central nervous system, it seems reasonable not to start any treatment since the outcome of this condition is always benign.
Prostanoids are used in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and acral perfusion disorders secondary to collagenosis. In subjective terms, intravenous administration of these agents produces success in more than 50% of patients. The therapeutic outcome of clinical administration of alprostadil or iloprost may vary from individual to individual.
The following variables were analysed in a cross-over study in 27 patients with collagenosis and Raynaud's phenomenon: plasma viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation (rheological variables), partial pressure of oxygen and laser Doppler flowmetry in the finger region, and lymphocyte phenotyping and interleukin (IL) determinations (immunological variables).
Laser Doppler flowmetry revealed significant differences between patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and a control group of 25 healthy subjects. Laser Doppler readings did not change significantly as a result of the treatments. Therapy with iloprost produced a reduction in IL-1beta, L-selectin (CD 62 L) and IL-6.
The change in immunological variables due to iloprost may explain the long-term effects of prostaglandins in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon. From our results it is not possible to infer any preference for iloprost or alprostadil.
Transmission of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs raises public health concerns. Through surveillance of drug-resistant HIV-1 in 603 treatment-naive, recently diagnosed HIV-1-infected persons, we identified a distinct group of viruses that have mutations at codon 215 of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene that are different from either the wild-type (WT) T or the zidovudine (AZT)-selected T215Y/F. These mutations included 215D/C/S and were found in 20 patients (3.3%). The 215D, 215C, and 215S mutations differ from 215Y by a 1-nt change compared with 2 nt for the WT T215 and likely represent revertants of 215Y. These viruses all were found to have WT susceptibility to AZT, and all replicated efficiently as WT HIV-1(T215). However, differences in fitness among HIV-1(215D), HIV-1(215C), and HIV-1(215S) were seen when RT backgrounds were changed, demonstrating a role of the RT background in the selection of these revertants. In vitro selection with AZT showed that HIV-1(215D) and HIV-1(215C) acquired 215Y more rapidly than did WT HIV-1(T215), likely reflecting the need for only 1-nt change to evolve to 215Y. Our study demonstrates that HIV-1 with unusual mutations at codon 215 replicate efficiently, have WT susceptibility, and are commonly found in treatment-naive persons. The increased ability for selecting resistance mutations defines this class of WT HIV-1 and highlights the higher potential of these viruses to compromise the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy.
Acute liver failure (ALF) remains a disease with poor patient outcome. Improved prognosis is associated with spontaneous liver regeneration, which supports the relevance of exploring 'regenerative' therapies. Therefore, the role of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in liver regeneration following ALF was investigated. ALF was induced in mice by acetaminophen overdose, which is also a leading cause of liver failure in patients. beta-catenin distribution was also studied in liver sections from acetaminophen-induced ALF patients. A nonlethal dose of acetaminophen, which induces liver regeneration, led to stabilization and activation of beta-catenin for 1 to 12 hours. These data were also verified by increased expression of the beta-catenin surrogate target glutamine synthetase. Beta-catenin activation occurred secondary to the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and an increase in levels of casein kinase 2alpha, and led to increased cyclin-D1, another known beta-catenin target. These observations were next substantiated in beta-catenin conditional-null mice (beta-catenin-null), which show dampened regeneration after acetaminophen injury following induction of CYP2e1/1a2 expression. In light of decreased acetaminophen injury in beta-catenin-null mice despite CYP induction, equitoxic studies in control mice were performed. Significant differences in regeneration persisted following comparable injury in beta-catenin-null and control animals. Retrospective analysis of liver samples from acetaminophen-overdose patients demonstrated a positive correlation between nuclear beta-catenin, proliferation, and spontaneous liver regeneration. Thus, our studies demonstrate early activation of beta-catenin signaling during acetaminophen-induced injury, which contributes to hepatic regeneration.
