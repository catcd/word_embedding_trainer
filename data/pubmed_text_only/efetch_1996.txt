The use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for congestive heart failure. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. However, the expression of HIF-1alpha in chronic heart failure resulting from volume overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known.
To test the hypothesis that HIF-1alpha plays a role in the failing myocardium because of volume overload, an aorta-caval shunt was created for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce volume-overload heart failure. Carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. The heart weight and body weight ratio increased from 2.6 +/- 0.3 in the sham group to 3.9 +/- 0.7 (P < .001) in the shunt group. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased from 6.5 +/- 0.5 mm to 8.7 +/- 0.6 mm (P < .001). Treatment with carvedilol in the shunt group reversed the heart weight and ventricular dimension to the baseline values. Western blot showed that HIF-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) proteins were upregulated and nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta) downregulated in the shunt group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP increased and mRNA of NGF-beta decreased in the shunt group. Treatment with carvedilol reversed both protein and mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta to the baseline values. Increased immunohistochemical labeling of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the shunt group and carvedilol again normalized the labeling.
HIF-1alpha and VEGF mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in the rat model of volume-overload heart failure. Treatment with carvedilol is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of HIF-1alpha and VEGF in the failing ventricular myocardium.
We describe the cases of 7 patients with hydroxyurea-induced melanonychia. In two of the patients, a dermatomyositis-like eruption was also present.
Olaquindox is used in China as feed additive for growth promotion in pigs. Recently, we have demonstrated that olaquindox induced genome DNA damage and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by olaquindox in HepG2 cells. In the present study olaquindox induced cell cycle arrest to the S phase and dose-dependent apoptotic cell death in HepG2 cells, indicated by accumulation of sub-G1 cell population, nuclear condenstion, DNA fragmentation, caspases activation and PARP cleavage. Meanwhile, the data showed that olaquindox triggered ROS-mediated apoptosis in HepG2 cells correlated with both the mitochondrial DNA damage and nuclear DNA damage, collapse of Δψ(m), opening of mPTP, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax. Furthermore, we also found that olaquindox increased the expression of p53 protein and induced the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to cytosol. In conclusion, olaquindox induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells through a caspase-9 and -3 dependent mitochondrial pathway, involving p53, Bcl-2 family protein expression, Δψ(m) disruption and mPTP opening.
It has long been recognised that neural factors are of considerable importance in lower urinary tract function. Whilst reduction in the bulk of the human prostate is feasible, experience on this therapeutic approach proved to be disappointing. Existing trial data with the agent finasteride are reviewed. A number of formulations derived from plant extracts have been advocated but their mechanism of action remain largely obscure and there is a dearth of placebo controlled information to support their efficacy. Experience over the last 10 years has demonstrated efficacy with the use of alpha adrenoceptor blockade in the management of BPH. Alpha adrenoceptor antagonists relax the prostatic smooth muscle by interrupting the sympathetic pathway at the receptor level. Recent developments in this field include the recognition that there are alpha I adrenoceptor subtypes. The functional adrenoceptor in the human prostate is predominantly the alpha IA - subtype. Of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists only tamsulosin discriminates between the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes. Alpha 1-blockers should be used in first-line medical therapy for BPH and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors reserved for those patients in whom alpha-blocker therapy fails. Alpha I-blockers such as doxazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, alfuzosin are effective in the treatment of BPH both in younger and in older men. The drugs are well tolerated. The majority of side effects were classified as minor and mild. The most common complaints, as with other alpha-blockers, are dizziness, fatigue and headache, and these are often transient. In contrast, finasteride can lead to impotence, reduced libido. gynaecomastia or ejaculatory disorders. Men with small prostates may not be suitable candidates for finasteride therapy.
1. A possible cerebroprotective effect of a chemically stable prostacyclin analogue, beraprost sodium, was investigated in a canine model of cerebral ischaemia. Cerebral ischaemia was produced by the combined occlusions of the left subclavian and the brachiocephalic arteries with preceding ligations of the intercostal arteries. 2. The decrease in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (BRS), measured by phenylephrine-induced reflex bradycardia, following 5 min ischaemia was used to assess the cerebroprotective effect. 3. Beraprost (1 microgram kg-1 min-1 i.v., infused for 15 min just before ischaemia) completely prevented the decrease in BRS. Although the lower dose of beraprost (0.1 microgram kg-1 min-1 i.v.) failed to show such a protective effect, its inhibitory effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation was as potent as that of the higher dose. 4. The extent of decrease in BRS was inversely correlated with the extent of the residual blood flow in the medulla oblongata during ischaemia. Since beraprost did not affect the extent of the residual blood flow during ischaemia, its cerebroprotective effect could not be ascribed to the reduction of the degree of ischaemia by increasing collateral blood flow to the brain. 5. Post-ischaemic reduction of the regional blood flow in the medulla and the cerebral cortex was completely prevented by the higher dose of beraprost. 6. The present study suggests that the cerebroprotective effect of beraprost may be independent of its anti-aggregatory and vasodilator effects. It is possible that the protection may be due to a prostacyclin-like cytoprotective effect through membrane stabilization.
Pathways of drug-specific T-cell stimulation have not been fully defined. The aim of this study was to use T-cell clones from a patient hypersensitive to the drug trimethoprim to characterize the involvement of drug metabolism and processing in antigen presentation and cross-reactivity patterns. The MHC-restricted CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response was dependent on the presence of antigen-presenting cells, and both processing-dependent and -independent pathways of antigen presentation were detected. Stimulation of certain clones was blocked through inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzyme activity. Trimethoprim clones were additionally stimulated with diaveridine and pyrimethamine but not other closely related structures.
IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10/CXCL10) is a non-ELR-CXC chemokine that is present during various forms of acute and chronic liver injury. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of IP-10 during acute liver injury induced by acetaminophen (APAP). After a 400 mg/kg APAP challenge in fasted CD-1 mice, immunoreactive levels of IP-10 were dramatically elevated in the serum within 8 h. CXCR3, the receptor for IP-10, was up-regulated in the liver. Mice that received an i.v. injection of rIP-10 10 h after APAP challenge exhibited a dramatic reduction in alanine aminotransferase 8 h later. Histologic analysis confirmed that the delayed IP-10 therapy dramatically improved the appearance of the liver when examined 48 h after APAP. The therapeutic effect of IP-10 was associated with a marked increase in CXCR2 expression on hepatocytes. Neutralization of CXCR2 during IP-10 therapy resulted in an abrogation of the hepatoprotective effect of IP-10. Furthermore, IP-10 treatment of cultured hepatocytes stimulated a CXCR2-dependent proliferative response. In conclusion, IP-10 has a hepatoregenerative effect in a murine model of acute liver injury that is dependent on its up-regulation of CXCR2 on hepatocytes.
Since diabetes induces testicular oxidative damage and cell death, and zinc (Zn) plays an important role in the spermatogenesis, the objective of the present study was to define the effects of Zn deficiency on diabetes-induced testicular apoptosis and associated mechanisms. Zn deficiency was induced by chronic treatment of normal and diabetic mice with N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylemethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) chelation. After diabetes onset, mice were given intraperitoneally TPEN at 5mg/kg daily for four months, which, like diabetes, induced a significant decrease in testicular Zn level. TUNEL staining revealed that testicular apoptosis was significantly increased along with an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, in diabetic mice and TPEN-treated normal mice. Zn deficiency significantly exacerbated diabetes-induced testicular apoptosis, along with significantly increased oxidative and nitrosative damage and down-regulation of antioxidant Nrf2 expression. Increased oxidative stress was associated with an increase in activation of p38 MAPK and p53 protein in diabetic testis, which was worsened in the testes of diabetic mice with Zn deficiency. Diabetes also induced a significant increase in endoplasmic reticulum stress and associated cell death, which was not affected by Zn deficiency. These results suggest that like diabetes, chronic depletion of Zn with TPEN induces testicular oxidative stress and damage, along with the activation of p38 MAPK and p53 signaling and mitochondria-related apoptotic cell death. Therefore, prevention of Zn deficiency for diabetic patients is important in order to avoid the exacerbation of diabetic effects on testicular cells death.
It was demonstrated that fenofibrate and telmisartan exerted renoprotective effects in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Because the combination of fenofibrate and telmisartan synergistically enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activation, we hypothesized that the combination of both drugs may exert prolonged beneficial effects in renal I/R injury than fenofibrate alone. Forty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into eight groups. Hyperlipidemia was induced by cholesterol feeding for 4 weeks. At the end of the fourth week, renal I/R injury was performed by occlusion of both renal vascular pedicles for 60 minutes, followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. In the treatment group, fenofibrate alone and in combination with telmisartan was administered 2 weeks prior to renal ischemia. At the end of the experiment, blood and kidneys were isolated for biochemical and histological analysis. I/R in hyperlipidemic rat shows significantly increased lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and myeloperoxidase activity, and depletion of antioxidant enzyme compared with control rats, and that was significantly restored after fenofibrate and telmisartan treatment. Also, significant increases in serum homocysteine level were detected following I/R. Fenofibrate treatment further elevated homocysteine level, which was reduced by telmisartan in combination with fenofibrate. The most significant histological damage was found in the hyperlipidemic rat subjected to renal I/R, which was reduced significantly with combination therapy. The results of this study concluded that fenofibrate alone and in combination with telmisartan significantly ameliorated renal I/R injury. The additive beneficial effect of telmisartan is predicted to reduce homocysteine-induced oxidative stress through reduced nitric oxide production during I/R.
The D2/AKT1/GSK-3β signaling pathway has been involved in the downstream intracellular effects of dopamine, in the pathophysiology of cognitive deficits and related brain activity in schizophrenia, as well as in response to treatment with antipsychotics. Polymorphisms in the D2 (DRD2 rs1076560) and AKT1 (AKT1 rs1130233) genes have been associated with their respective protein expression and with higher-order cognition and brain function, including attention. Given the strong potential for their relationship, we investigated the interaction of these polymorphisms on multiple molecular and in vivo phenotypes associated with this signaling pathway. We measured AKT1 and GSK-3β proteins and phosphorylation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, functional MRI cingulate response during attentional control, behavioral accuracy during sustained attention, and response to 8 wk of treatment with olanzapine in a total of 190 healthy subjects and 66 patients with schizophrenia. In healthy subjects, we found that the interaction between the T allele of DRD2 rs1076560 and the A allele of AKT1 rs1130233 was associated with reduced AKT1 protein levels and reduced phosphorylation of GSK-3β, as well as with altered cingulate response and reduced behavioral accuracy during attentional processing. On the other hand, interaction of these two alleles was associated with greater improvement of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores in patients with schizophrenia after treatment with olanzapine. The present results indicate that these functional polymorphisms are epistatically associated with multiple phenotypes of relevance to schizophrenia. Our results also lend support to further investigation of this downstream molecular pathway in the etiology and treatment of this disorder.
Treatment of Wistar rats with aluminum chloride causes astroglial and neuronal cell damage in the selective brain regions of association cortex and hippocampus, seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Adult Wistar rats were treated with unilateral intrahippocampal injection of AlCl3 in one single dose of 3.7 g/kg b.w. Control group of animals was treated with 0.9% saline solution likewise. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation seven days after the treatment. Activity of cytochrome C oxidase (COX) and total glutathione content were measured in the ipsi- and contralateral hippocampus and forebrain cortex. Activity of COX was mutually decreased in the hippocampus (ipsi- 30%, contra- 34%), as well as in the forebrain cortex (ipsi- 44%, contra- 47%), compared to controls. These decrease could indicate a deficiency in reducing equivalents with concomitant altered proton gradient and function of electron transport chain, as well as decreased ATP synthesis. Content of glutathione, a clue antioxidative factor, was decreased for about 50% in all examined structures, primary suggesting an impaired regeneration of reduced glutathione. Such distribution of diminished antioxidative defense could be the consequence of the specific brain distribution of transferrin receptors, which was also a main protein carrier for Al. Furthermore, at the cellular level Al could impede glycolysis with consequent decreased production of reducing equivalents which were necessary for glutathione synthesis/reduction, as well as for proton gradient and functionality of electron-transport chain.
An episode of transient encephalopathy after the first course of intravenous high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX; 1000 mg/m2) was observed in a 4-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The neurological abnormalities took place 5 days after HD-MTX therapy. She experienced complex partial seizure and left hemiparesis, which resolved spontaneously in 5 days. Cranial computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple low-density lesions in bilateral hemispheres. It is well appreciated that neurotoxicity from MTX follows prolonged exposures, often accompanying or following radiation therapy. To our knowledge, however, there have been no reports that such neurological complications developed following a single exposure of HD-MTX in patients with ALL. Follow-up electroencephalograms showed that she had periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS), suggesting functional deafferentation of cortical neurons following HD-MTX. Moreover, the serum and CSF MTX levels following a second low-dose course and her clinical course suggested that she had presumably central nervous system leukemia at the time of HD-MTX therapy, which might have been related to neurological complications. The pathogenesis of MTX-induced neurotoxicity is discussed.
Pure red cell aplasia developed in a patient with small-cell lung cancer who was also taking sustained-release procainamide. Shortly after discontinuation of the procainamide preparation, a reticulocytosis and increasing hemoglobin level were observed.
A case of acute poisoning in a 32 months old child, with generalised and uncontrollable seizures is reported. Pyridoxine IV is efficacely used in such poisoning.
To determine whether recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (rhuLIF, AM424, emfilermin) can prevent or ameliorate the development of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) after treatment with carboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) over 3 hours).
Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial. Eligible patients had solid tumors for which treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel was appropriate. The primary end point was a standardized composite peripheral nerve electrophysiology (CPNE) score, based on nerve velocities and amplitudes, measured at baseline and after four cycles of chemotherapy. Secondary efficacy end points included CPNE score at last cycle and at exit evaluation, vibration perception threshold, H-reflex latency, symptom scores, and quantitative assessment of neurologic signs. Study drug was given s.c. daily for 7 days starting the day before chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive low-dose rhuLIF (2 microg/kg), high-dose rhuLIF (4 microg/kg), or placebo.
Patients (n = 117) were randomized across seven neurology test centers. Thirty-six patients received low dose rhuLIF (2 microg/kg), 39 received high dose rhuLIF (4 microg/kg) and 42 received placebo. rhuLIF was well tolerated with 95% compliance and no adverse effects on quality of life. No differences between groups in CPNE or any of the individual neurologic testing variables were observed between baseline and cycle 4 or by the secondary efficacy variables.
rhuLIF is not effective in preventing CIPN caused by carboplatin and paclitaxel. CPNE is a reliable and valid tool that was sensitive to the onset and progression of CIPN.
Nephrocalcinosis has been reported in patients treated with acetazolamide and other agents, such as furosemide or bicarbonate. We present a case of nephrocalcinosis induced solely by acetazolamide and diagnosed radiographically. Possible mechanisms of pathogenesis are reviewed.
In this prospective study, 28 (52 percent) of 54 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had ischemic necrosis of bone in 93 sites. All but two of the patients had multiple sites of involvement, with hips, knees, and shoulders affected in decreasing order of frequency. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were comparable in patients with and without ischemic necrosis of bone except for cushingoid changes in 24 (86 percent) of the 28 patients with ischemic necrosis of bone versus four (15 percent) of the 26 patients without ischemic necrosis of bone (p less than 0.0001). The duration of steroid therapy, total cumulative steroid dose, and the mean daily prednisone dose for the first one, three, six, and 12 months of therapy were not significantly different between the two groups. Mean daily prednisone dose for the highest single month as well as the highest consecutive three, six, and 12 months of therapy was significantly higher in patients with ischemic necrosis of bone. The mean daily dose of prednisone for the highest month of therapy was greater than 40 mg per day in 93 percent and greater than 20 mg per day in all patients with ischemic necrosis of bone. In patients with ischemic necrosis of bone, there was a statistically significant correlation between higher mean prednisone dose at all time intervals and increased number of bony sites involved. A lower mean dose of prednisone was required to produce ischemic necrosis of bone in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon.
Amineptine is a new tricyclic compound with a grafted long aliphatic chain active on Dopamine synaptic release and as such more desinhibitor, safer and short acting. The study was coordinated by a national and 13 local counsellors. It was an open study. Inclusions criteria and results are examined, making obvious that patients responded well according to the Hamilton rating scale for depression (17 item version--16.4 points dropped at day 7th in 43%) and that it is an efficaceous antidepressant.
Sibutramine is an amphetamine-like drug used for its weight reducing effect. Sibutramine-induced acute coronary syndrome has rarely been reported. We report a case of myocardial infarction associated with the use of sibutramine.
A 37-year-old woman presented to an Emergency Department (ED) with intermittent retrosternal chest pain, nausea, and sweating for 3 days. She reported taking one sibutramine tablet each day for 3 days. Blood pressure was 128/89 mm Hg and pulse 66 beats/min. An electrocardiogram revealed ST elevation over the inferior leads and ST depression over leads AVR and V1, the other leads were normal. Serum troponin T was 0.65 microg/L, and sibutramine was identified in her urine. Echocardiography revealed mild hypokinesia over the inferior wall without evidence of acute aortic dissection. The ST segment changes resolved spontaneously within 24 h of cardiac care unit (CCU) admission, a coronary angiogram performed 1 week later was unremarkable, and echocardiography performed 4 weeks after the event showed normal resting regional wall motion.
Seventeen medications containing sibutramine as an active ingredient were registered in Hong Kong in 2007. Sibutramine was introduced in the United States in 1997 and in Australia, United Kingdom, and Italy in 2001. Hypertension, tachycardia, dry mouth, and headache are the most commonly reported adverse reactions. Cardiovascular toxicities include tachycardia, palpitation, hypertension, and tachyarrhythmia.
We postulate that the myocardial infarction was the result of coronary vasospasm associated with the therapeutic use of sibutramine-containing slimming pills.
Vanishing bile duct syndrome is a severe cholestatic disease associated with toxic effects of medications. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a hypersensitivity disorder that may also be caused by medications. We present a case of a 62-year-old male patient who developed vanishing bile duct syndrome a month after Stevens-Johnson syndrome. These adverse drug reactions were associated with the use of azithromycin (500 mg daily for 3 days). The patient was initially treated for Stevens-Johnson syndrome with steroids, antihistamines and proton pump inhibitors and fully recovered. However, a month after the beginning of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, he developed vanishing bile duct syndrome and was treated with steroids, ursodeoxycholic acid, antihistamines and tacrolimus. Unfortunately, the treatment was unsuccessful and he was listed for liver transplantation which was performed 7 months after the beginning of jaundice. This is the first case of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with the use of azithromycin and one of few that reports vanishing bile duct syndrome and Stevens-Johnson syndrome co-occurrence.
Expression levels of miR-146b-5p and -3p microRNAs in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are associated with recurrence of the disease after surgery. To understand this, the effect of miR-146b overexpression was studied in A549 human lung cancer cells.
A549 cells, engineered with lentiviruses to overexpress the human pre-miR-146b precursor microRNA, were examined for proliferation, colony formation on plastic surface and in soft agar, migration and invasiveness in cell culture and in vivo in mice, chemosensitivity to cisplatin and doxorubicin, and global gene expression. miR-146b expressions were assessed in microdissected stroma and epithelia of human NSCLC tumors. Association of miR-146b-5p and -3p expression in early stage NSCLC with recurrence was analyzed.
A549 pre-miR-146b-overexpressors had 3-8-fold higher levels of both miR-146b microRNAs than control cells. Overexpression did not alter cellular proliferation, chemosensitivity, migration, or invasiveness; affected only 0.3% of the mRNA transcriptome; and, reduced the ability to form colonies in vitro by 25%. In human NSCLC tumors, expression of both miR-146b microRNAs was 7-10-fold higher in stroma than in cancerous epithelia, and higher miR-146b-5p but lower -3p levels were predictive of recurrence.
Only a minimal effect of pre-miR-146b overexpression on the malignant phenotype was seen in A549 cells. This could be because of opposing effects of miR-146b-5p and -3p overexpression as suggested by the conflicting recurrence-predictive values of the two microRNAs, or because miR-146b expression changes in non-cancerous stroma and not cancerous epithelia of tumors are responsible for the prognostic value of miR-146b.
Ten narcoleptic patients were treated daily with Mazindol 2-6 mg for 42.2 months (31-63 months). The response was excellent on narcoleptic attacks in 6 and on cataplexy in 7 cases. However, the nocturnal sleep disturbance persisted unchanged. The improvement was poor in 1 case and inexistant in 1 subject. Minor side effects (dry mouth) occurred in 3 cases, and urinary retention obliged to stop the medication in 2 cases.
Loop diuretics are known to affect renal hemodynamics and possibly gene transcription, but the specific effect of furosemide on renal angiogenesis gene expression after acute ischemia is not known. We utilized an acute renal failure model in rats to test the hypothesis that furosemide improves renal hemodynamics and alters the transcriptional signature of acute ischemic nephropathy. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized by the intraperitoneal administration of 50 mg/kg urethane. Animals were divided into four groups (n = 6 each): (1) sham-operated group infused with saline; (2) sham-operated group infused with 30 microg/kg/hr furosemide (equivalent to a human dosage of 2 mg/hr); (3) unilateral renal ischemia (1 hr, left renal artery cross-clamping) followed by 6 hr of reperfusion; and (4) renal ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) with furosemide. Renal artery blood flow (RBF), renal cortical perfusion (RCP), and renal corticomedullary tissue oxygen tension (PO2) were recorded throughout. Following 6 hr of reperfusion, left kidney RNA was used to probe microarrays. Gene expression was measured as percent positive control and confirmed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Physiologic data were analyzed by calculating area under the curve, and gene expression data were compared by using multiple analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc tests. Furosemide significantly increased RBF (P < 0.05) and PO2 (P < 0.05) in postischemic kidneys. Furosemide attenuated nine of the 13 ischemia-induced and 41 of 78 ischemia-suppressed angiogenesis-related genes. This attenuation was statistically significant (P < 0.05) for 17 I/R injury-suppressed genes. Data from this rat model of ischemic nephropathy suggest that furosemide improves renal hemodynamics and attenuates ischemia-related changes in gene expression.
Anti-inflammation strategies are one of the proposed therapeutic approaches to hepatic fibrosis. Tetrandrine (C(38)H(42)O(8)N(2), molecular weight: 622; Tet), an alkaloid isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Stephania tetrandra, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory activity in pulmonary diseases. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of Tet on hepatic fibrosis.
A cell line of rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC-T6) was stimulated with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The inhibitory effects of Tet on the nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) signaling cascade and molecular markers including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) secretion were assessed. Fibrosis was induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) administration in rats for 4 weeks. Fibrotic rats were randomly assigned to one of the four groups: vehicle (0.7% carboxyl methyl cellulose, CMC), Tet (1 mg/kg), Tet (5 mg/kg), or silymarin (50 mg/kg), each given by gavage twice daily for 3 weeks starting after 1 week of DMN administration. At the end of the study, liver tissues were scored for fibrosis and analyzed for molecular markers of fibrosis.
Tetrandrine (0.5-5.0 micromol/L) concentration-dependently inhibited NFkappaB transcriptional activity induced by TNF-alpha, including IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and mRNA expressions of ICAM-1 in HSC-T6 cells. In addition, Tet also inhibited TGF-beta1-induced alpha-SMA secretion and collagen deposition in HSC-T6 cells. Fibrosis scores of livers from DMN-treated rats with high-dose Tet (1.3 +/- 0.3) were significantly reduced in comparison with DMN-treated rats receiving saline (2.0 +/- 0.2). Hepatic collagen content of DMN rats was significantly reduced by either Tet or silymarin treatment. Double-staining results showed that alpha-SMA- and NFkappaB-positive cells were decreased in the fibrotic livers by Tet and silymarin treatment. In addition, mRNA expression of ICAM-1, alpha-SMA, and TGF-beta1 was attenuated by Tet treatment. Moreover, levels of plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities were reduced by Tet and silymarin treatment.
Tetrandrine exerts antifibrotic effects in both HSC-T6 cells and in rats with DMN-induced fibrosis.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2) inhibitors are structurally heterogeneous drugs that share similar therapeutic actions and adverse effects. Hepatotoxicity, although a relatively rare adverse effect of this class of drugs, can be severe. This has led to the withdrawal of some NSAIDs from the market. Nimesulide is an NSAID, with cox-2 preference, which has been reported to cause death from hepatic failure. However, most reports have been from European countries. Asian reports include that from Israel and India. We report three patients who presented with acute hepatitis after being prescribed nimesulide, one of whom died from fulminant hepatic failure.
