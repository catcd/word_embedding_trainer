U46619 is a potent thromboxane A(2) mimetic with emesis-inducing actions that are mediated via prostanoid TP receptors. We investigated its emetic mechanism of action in more detail using the ferret as model animal. The emesis induced by U46619 (30 microg/kg, intraperitoneal) was antagonized significantly by (+)-(2S,3S)-3-(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine hydrochloride (CP-99,994; 1 and 10 mg/kg; P < 0.05) and metoclopramide (0.3 and 3 mg/kg), but not by domperidone (3 mg/kg), sulpiride (0.1 mg/kg), ondansetron (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) alone or combined with droperidol (3 mg/kg), GR125487 (1 mg/kg), promethazine (3 mg/kg), or scopolamine (3 mg/kg); GR 125487 (1 mg/kg) prevented the anti-emetic action of metoclopramide (3 mg/kg). U46619 0.3 microg administered into the fourth ventricle rapidly induced emesis. However, bilateral abdominal vagotomy was ineffective in reducing the emetic response (P > 0.05). Our data suggests that U46619 induces emesis via an extra-abdominal mechanism, probably within the brain. Metoclopramide probably has a mechanism of action to prevent U46619-induced emesis via 5-HT(4) receptor activation and NK(1) tachykinin receptor antagonists could be useful to prevent emesis induced by TP receptor activation in man.
Chronic pleural effusion occurred in three patients, one of whom also developed acute pericarditis. A fourth patient developed both pleural and pericardial effusions. All patients had been receiving dantrolene sodium for at least two months. The pleural fluid was a sterile exudate with pleural and peripheral blood eosinophilia in all patients. No pulmonary parenchymal involvement was apparent. Pleural biopsy specimens showed nonspecific inflammation. Resolution of the pleural process was prolonged after dantrolene therapy was discontinued. Although a causal relationship between dantrolene and serosal inflammation remains unproved, this association in four patients warrants careful observation of others receiving long-term dantrolene therapy.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon but sometimes fatal complication of neuroleptics and other medications that involve the central dopaminergic system. Many diagnostic criteria have been proposed for NMS but because of its variable presentation, universal criteria have not been established yet. Hyperthermia, disturbances of consciousness, extrapyramidal and autonomic symptoms are common features of NMS. We report the case of a 36 years old woman suffering from chronic schizophrenia and treated with flufenazine and olanzapine, who presented with series of generalised tonic-clonic seizures as the acute onset of recurrent malignant neuroleptic syndrome. Although atypical neuroleptics were previously thought to have less risk for MNS, combination of conventional and atypical neuroleptics in therapy increases the risk of NMS development and olanzapine might be responsible for the epileptic manifestations at the onset of fulminant NMS.
The dose-cumulative cardiotoxicities and the emerging cancerous apoptotic/drug resistance are two major obstacles limiting the efficacy of anthracycline antibiotics, notably doxorubicin. We attempted to prove if schisandrin B (Sch B), a dual inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, could protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, on the premise that Sch B is an enhancer of glutathione redox cycling that may attenuate doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress in the cardiomyocytes.
Mice or rat were dosed with a single injection of doxorubicin (25 mg/kg, i.p.) with or without pretreatment of Sch B. The protective roles of Sch B against doxorubicin-induced cardiac damage were evaluated on the aspects of the release of cardiac enzymes into serum, the formation of malondialdehyde, the activation of matrix metalloproteinase, the structural damage in the left ventricles, the mortality rates, and the cardiac functions.
Pretreatment of Sch B significantly attenuated doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicities on all the aspects listed above. The underlying mechanism was associated with the effect of Sch B on maintaining the cardiomyocytic glutathione and the activities of superoxide dismutase, and the key enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione transferase) responsible for glutathione redox cycling, which neutralized doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress.
To the best of our knowledge, Sch B is the only molecule ever proved to function as a cardioprotective agent as well as a dual inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, which is potentially applicable to treat cancers, especially the multidrug-resistant cancers involving doxorubicin or its kin.
A case of a child with growth retardation and prolonged osteomalacia, as a result of chronic renal tubulopathy, following successful therapy for a sacral-coccygeal germinal tumour, is described. The male patient was enrolled into the research programme for the evaluation of the association between deletion of the genes encoding a number of classes of glutathione S-transferases (GST) and adverse reactions to alkylating agents. His genotype revealed the genes encoding glutathione transferase classes GSTM1 and GSTT1, but these enzymes did not provide adequate protection for the tubular cells, from the toxic effects of ifosfamide metabolites. Intense chemotherapy resulted in an increased risk of chronic side effects. Further studies are necessary for increased understanding of the inter-individual variability in the extent and nature of ifosfamide nephrotoxicity.
The cochleae from 3 lines of mice, selectively bred for differential susceptibility to priming-induced audiogenic seizures, were examined following acoustic priming and retest or kanamycin treatment, and the degree of cochlear damage was assessed. After 60 sec of acoustic priming, animals from the high and unselected lines which had subsequently developed audiogenic seizure susceptibility exhibited severe cochlear damage limited to the outer hair cells. Low line mice, which had been selected for resistance to acoustic priming-induced audiogenic seizures and were not seizure susceptible, exhibited no cochlear pathology following acoustic priming. Following kanamycin treatment, all 3 lines developed subsequent audiogenic seizure susceptibility. Histological examination of cochleae from mice so treated revealed a pattern of damage similar to that caused by acoustic priming, except that the cochleae of priming-induced audiogenic seizure resistant low line mice revealed a significant amount of outer hair cell damage. The results are discussed with respect to the physiological mechanism underlying a selectively bred behavioral phenotype in terms of a possible instance of damage/disuse-supersensitivity in the central nervous system.
Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR/NIH strain) harbor a deletion variant in the Cd36 fatty acid transporter and display defective fatty acid metabolism, insulin resistance and hypertension. Transgenic rescue of Cd36 in SHR ameliorates insulin resistance and improves dyslipidemia. However, the role of Cd36 in blood pressure regulation remains controversial due to inconsistent blood pressure effects that were observed with transgenic expression of Cd36 on the SHR background. In the current studies, we developed two new SHR transgenic lines, which express wild type Cd36 under the control of the universal Ef-1 alpha promoter, and examined the effects of transgenic expression of wild type Cd36 on selected metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes. Transgenic expression of Cd36 in the new lines was associated with significantly decreased serum fatty acids, amelioration of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance but failed to induce any consistent changes in blood pressure as measured by radiotelemetry. The current findings confirm the genetic association of defective Cd36 with disordered insulin action and fatty acid metabolism in the SHR/NIH strain and suggest that Cd36 is linked to other gene(s) on rat chromosome 4 that regulate blood pressure.
Acute lithium intoxication may occur in circumstances causing kidney failure, when using lithium chronically. This situation may lead to neurological symptoms with coma, gastrointestinal disorders with diarrhea, cardiovascular symptoms with hypotension and metabolic symptoms with hypercalcemia. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may also develop. We report the case of a 69-year-old woman suffering from unipolar manic-depressive psychosis and treated by lithium for 10 years. This case highlights the need to monitor serum lithium levels in patients on long-term lithium regimens, especially in circumstances involving dehydration.
A 74-year-old man with parkinsonism developed progressive cognitive and behavioral dysfunction suggesting coexistent Alzheimer's disease. The intellectual and behavioral disturbances were reversed following withdrawal of his anticholinergic antiparkinsonian medication. This case demonstrates that anticholinergic drugs used to treat parkinsonism may mimic or exacerbate the clinical signs of Alzheimer's disease and suggests that these medications should be withdrawn for all parkinsonian patients who develop significant impairments of cognition or behavior.
Retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide target the protein stability and transcriptional repression activity of the fusion oncoprotein PML-RARA, resulting in regression of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Phenotypically, retinoic acid induces differentiation of APL cells. Here we show that retinoic acid also triggers growth arrest of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) ex vivo and their clearance in PML-RARA mouse APL in vivo. Retinoic acid treatment of mouse APLs expressing the fusion protein PLZF-RARA triggers full differentiation, but not LIC loss or disease remission, establishing that differentiation and LIC loss can be uncoupled. Although retinoic acid and arsenic synergize to clear LICs through cooperative PML-RARA degradation, this combination does not enhance differentiation. A cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent phosphorylation site in PML-RARA is crucial for retinoic acid-induced PML-RARA degradation and LIC clearance. Moreover, activation of cAMP signaling enhances LIC loss by retinoic acid, identifying cAMP as another potential APL therapy. Thus, whereas transcriptional activation of PML-RARA is likely to control differentiation, its catabolism triggers LIC eradication and long-term remission of mouse APL. Therapy-triggered degradation of oncoproteins could be a general strategy to eradicate cancer stem cells.
Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that GABAB receptor agonists selectively decrease cocaine use. The behavioral mechanism for the interaction between baclofen and cocaine in humans is not known, nor have its effects been characterized in individuals dependent on both cocaine and methadone. The objective of this study is to determine how maintenance on baclofen influences smoked cocaine's reinforcing and subjective effects, mood and cocaine craving prior to and after the initiation of cocaine use in cocaine-dependent volunteers with and without concurrent opioid dependence. Nontreatment-seeking volunteers (10 nonopioid dependent; seven methadone maintained), residing on an in-patient research unit for 21 days, were maintained on each baclofen dose (0, 30, 60 mg po) for 7 days. A smoked cocaine dose-response curve (0, 12, 25, 50 mg) was determined twice: on days 3-4 and days 6-7 of each baclofen maintenance condition. Cocaine sessions began with a sample trial, when participants smoked the cocaine dose available that session, and five choice trials, when participants chose between smoking the available cocaine dose or receiving one 5 dollars merchandise voucher. The results show that in the nonmethadone group, baclofen (60 mg) decreased self-administration of a low cocaine dose (12 mg). In the methadone group, baclofen decreased craving for cocaine. In both groups, baclofen decreased cocaine's effects on heart rate. Baclofen did not alter cocaine's robust subjective effects (eg 'High,' 'Stimulated') for either group. The results from this laboratory study appear consistent with clinical evidence showing that baclofen decreases cocaine use in nonopioid-dependent patients seeking treatment for cocaine dependence. The distinct pattern of effects in methadone-maintained participants suggests baclofen may not be effective in opioid-dependent cocaine users.
Following acute chemical injury, hepatocytes are generally more resistant to toxicant re-exposure. Alterations in expression of hepatobiliary transport systems may contribute to this resistance by preventing accumulation of potentially toxic chemicals. Previous data demonstrate the concomitant reduction of uptake transporter and induction of efflux transporter mRNA during chemical liver injury. The present study further characterizes the expression of multidrug resistance-associated proteins 1-4 (Mrp1-4), breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) and sodium-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (Ntcp) in mouse liver following administration of the hepatotoxicants acetaminophen (APAP) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Mice received hepatotoxic doses of APAP (400 mg/kg), CCl4 (10 or 25 microl/kg), or vehicle, ip. Livers were collected at 6, 24, and 48 h for Western blot quantification and immunofluorescence analysis. Protein expression of Bcrp was unchanged with treatment. Ntcp levels were preserved in APAP-exposed livers and reduced to 30-50% of control after CCl4. Conversely, Mrp1-4 expression was differentially up-regulated. CCl4 increased Mrp1 (3.5-fold), Mrp2 (1.4-fold), and Mrp4 (26-fold) while reducing Mrp3 levels to 20% of control. Administration of APAP enhanced expression of Mrp2 (1.6-fold), Mrp3 (3.5-fold), and Mrp4 (16-fold). Immunostaining of liver sections obtained 48 h after hepatotoxicant treatment confirmed expression patterns of a subset of transporters (Bcrp, Ntcp, Mrp3, and Mrp4). Double immunofluorescence imaging demonstrated the simultaneous down-regulation of Ntcp and up-regulation of Mrp4 in hepatocytes adjacent to the central vein after CCl4. Altered expression of transporters may reduce the overall chemical burden of an injured liver during recovery and contribute to the resistance of hepatocytes to subsequent toxicant exposure.
In one hospital over a 15-month period, four out of nine patients ventilated for acute severe asthma developed acute hydrocortisone myopathy. All patients had received less than 1.0 g day-1 hydrocortisone. Affected patients had severe generalized weakness which recovered over 1-6 weeks. When myopathic and unaffected subjects were compared, there was no clearcut difference with respect to age, sex, types of drug used, serum potassium levels, duration of ventilation and muscle paralysis, total dose of vecuronium bromide, or mean daily doses of hydrocortisone. The main difference between the two groups was in the total doses of hydrocortisone. The myopathic patients all received greater than 5.0 g hydrocortisone (range 5.4-10.2 g) and the others less than 4.0 g (range 0.9-3.5 g). The possibility that neuromuscular blockade might predispose to the development of myopathy is discussed. Hydrocortisone myopathy can occur when less than 1.0 g day-1 is used, and even with as little as 5.4 g given over 6 days.
We studied 50 patients with Parkinson's disease to determine any relation of epidemiologic factors (such as the duration of illness), the duration of levodopa therapy, the total amount of administered levodopa to degree of autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic dysfunction was evaluated using the composite autonomic scoring scale (CASS). The CASS scores were significantly higher among patients with greater administration amount of levodopa regardless of the duration of illness (p < 0.05). There was a definite positive correlation between cardiovascular heart rate index, which was one of the parameters of CASS and reflected parasympathetic neuron system function of cardiac origin, and the duration of levodopa therapy (r = 0.44, p < 0.01) or the total administered amount of levodopa (r = 0.43, p < 0.01). We conclude that long-term levodopa therapy negatively affects autonomic nervous function.
Reye syndrome (RS) is an acute encephalopathy in childhood, and is very rare in adulthood. Here we report a 21-year-old woman with RS. Because of her dysmenorrhea, she took 3 tablets of diclofenac sodium (25 mg) per day in 3 divided doses for two days. Two days after the last intake of the medicine, she developed high fever, nausea, vomiting, and disturbance of consciousness with delirium, i.e., acute encephalopathy. She did not have seizure, hemiplegia, or other focal neurological manifestations. The serum GOT level was normal at onset, but in 12 hours dramatically increased up to 8,632 IU/L. The serum bilirubin level was normal. The cerebrospinal fluid revealed normal cell count, and protein. Although the liver biopsy was not performed because of thrombocytopenia, we diagnosed her as an adult case of RS according to the clinical criteria of the Center for Disease Control. In addition to treatment for the brain edema, plasma exchange was performed once treat the encephalopathy at the onset. The next day, her consciousness level and serum GOT level markedly improved. She completely recovered from acute encephalopathy in a week after her admission. In conclusion, diclofenac sodium, as well as aspirin, should be considered as a possible causal agent for RS, and early plasma exchange may be beneficial.
In this study we report a case of valproate-induced delirium in a patient affected with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A 75-year-old woman with AD presented moderate cognitive impairment associated to behavioral disorders, characterized by aggression, agitation, severe insomnia. She was treated with galantamine, promazine, acetylsalicylic acid and pantoprazole. Since behavioral disorders worsened more and more, home neurological consultation was asked. The neurologist prescribed a mood stabilizer, sodium valproate 500 mg daily for the first week and then, twice a day and stopped promazine. After an apparent initial benefit, about 16 days later, patient suddenly developed hyperactive delirium. It was characterized by worsening of insomnia and agitation, severe confusion, delusions, visual hallucinations alternated to sedation. She became progressively unable to walk and completely dependent in daily living activities. An urgent geriatric consultation was performed at patient's home; physical examination showed mild dehydration, normal blood pressure. Oxygen saturation and electrocardiogram were normal. Sodium valproate was immediately stopped and rehydration was performed. The patient was admitted to a Geriatric Unit, where organic and metabolic damages were excluded. During the hospital stay the patient was agitated, aggressive, confused; intramuscular haloperidol 5mg and saline intravenous infusion 1500 cc daily were performed, they were partly successful. Three days after she was discharged and continued treatment with oral haloperidol 5mg daily. One week later the patient recovered and she is at present healthy. This is a case report of valproate-induced delirium. The Naranjo scale scored 7, classifying this drug-related event as probable. The present case report suggests the need for minimizing the use of psychoactive drugs in elderly demented patients, whether possible; age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suggest the opportunity of a careful evaluation and a slow titration of treatments in these patients.
Anthelmintic resistance in parasitic nematodes of small ruminants is widespread and, in some parts of the world, threatens the sustainability of sheep production. The genetic changes underlying resistance to anthelmintics, particularly ivermectin (IVM), remain to be determined. The majority of studies to date have investigated target site mutations; relatively little attention has been paid to the role of changes in gene expression. In this study, we investigated the expression of putative drug transporter molecules, P-glycoproteins (Pgps), in Teladorsagia circumcincta, the predominant parasitic nematode species of sheep in the UK and the major anthelmintic resistant species. Utilising a degenerate PCR approach, 11 partial Pgp sequences were identified. Constitutive differences in gene expression between an IVM-susceptible (MTci2) and a multidrug-resistant (MTci5) isolate were determined for 10 of the Pgps using the ΔΔCt TaqMan® real-time PCR method. Gene expression differences were particularly marked in one of these genes, namely Tci-pgp-9. In the MTci5 isolate, statistically significant increases in Tci-pgp-9 expression, at the mRNA level, were observed across all life-cycle stages and most notably in eggs (55-fold increase). Comparison of the partial Tci-pgp-9 nucleotide sequences from MTci2 and MTci5 also identified high levels of polymorphism. This work has shown that constitutively increased expression in Tci-pgp-9, coupled with increased sequence polymorphism, could play a role in allowing multidrug-resistant T. circumcincta to survive IVM exposure. The genetic changes underpinning these gene expression changes remain to be elucidated and need to be investigated in other isolates. These changes could form the basis of an IVM resistance marker to monitor the spread of resistance and to evaluate management practices aimed at delaying its spread.
Despite the fact that the side effects of prolonged treatment with dexamethasone are well known, information about its effects on the central nervous system is very limited. Experimental study of long-term effects of dexamethasone administration in the neonatal period on behavioral activity of rats in the open field was conducted. Four groups of newborn males were selected from the offspring of pregnant rats. The first group was left intact, the animals of second group were injected saline solution, the third group - with the dexamethasone and the fourth group - along with dexamethasone received L-arginine. Tests in an open field for all groups of animals were carried out on the 45th (first test) and 60th (second test) days after birth. The results showed that the decrease in motor activity of animals and in the number of sectors crossed in the open field with a high statistical significance was observed only in the group of animals, which for four days in the neonatal period underwent dexamethasone treatment. At the same time, another group of animals, which was also injected dexamethasone in the same doses, but additionally was injected L-arginine, the behavior in the open field did not differ from the intact animals or animals which were injected (as a control) saline solution. It was concluded that it is the lack of nitric oxide in the early neonatal period, which occurs as a result of dexamethasone treatment that causes observed changes in animals' behavior.
This study compares the efficacy of telmisartan with that of valsartan and ramipril in reducing blood pressure (BP) over 24 hrs in the elderly patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). This prospective and open label study analyzed a sample of 60 patients over 65 years of age with hypertension and with MS. At the beginning the BP was monitored by a 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (AMBP). Following this, the 60 patients were divided into 3 groups of 20, to each of which was prescribed, respectively, telmisartan, valsartan and ramipril to take for 12 weeks. The drugs were to be taken at 9.00 a.m. Later on the doses were increased. After 12 weeks of therapy, BP was monitored by a 24-hr AMBP. The use of telmisartan caused a greater reduction of the BP in the final 4-6 hours of the period between the 1st administration of the drug and the next one, these last 4-6 hours being those when cardiovascular and cerebrovascular accidents are more frequent (between 6.00 and 10.00 a.m.). Comparing to valsartan and ramipril, telmisartan results in excellent pressure control during the last 4-6 hours between the 1st administration of the drug and the next one.
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by large fluid-filled cysts and progressive deterioration of renal function necessitating renal replacement therapy. Previously, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible, kidney epithelium-specific Pkd1-deletion mouse model and showed that inactivation of the Pkd1 gene induces rapid cyst formation in developing kidneys and a slow onset of disease in adult mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that injury-induced tubular epithelial cell proliferation may accelerate cyst formation in the kidneys of adult Pkd1-deletion mice. Mice were treated with the nephrotoxicant 1,2-dichlorovinyl-cysteine (DCVC) after Pkd1-gene inactivation, which indeed accelerated cyst formation significantly. After the increased proliferation during tissue regeneration, proliferation decreased to basal levels in Pkd1-deletion mice just as in DCVC-treated controls. However, in severe cystic kidneys, 10-14 weeks after injury, proliferation increased again. This biphasic response suggests that unrestricted cell proliferation after injury is not the underlying mechanism for cyst formation. Aberrant planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling and increased canonical Wnt signaling are suggested to be involved in cyst formation. Indeed, we show here that in Pkd1 conditional deletion mice expression of the PCP component Four-jointed (Fjx1) is decreased while its expression is required during tissue regeneration. In addition, we show that altered centrosome position and the activation of canonical Wnt signaling are early effects of Pkd1-gene disruption. This suggests that additional stimuli or events are required to trigger the process of cyst formation. We propose that during tissue repair, the integrity of the newly formed Pkd1-deficient cells is modified rendering them susceptible to subsequent cyst formation.
Rate-dependent bifurcations and aperiodic changes in action potential duration and amplitude were observed in periodically stimulated cardiac Purkinje and ventricular muscle cells isolated from dogs with quinidine-induced ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. The slope of the action potential duration restitution curve was higher in the quinidine intoxicated fibers than in normal untreated fibers. Aperiodicity and bifurcations in action potential duration (APD) could not be observed in normal untreated cardiac fibers. The data suggest that induction of reentrant ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia could be brought about not by fixed but rather by changing alterations in cellular electrical activity. Theory based on nonlinear dynamics seems to provide a quantitative basis for such an analysis. This could have important implications in the issue of sudden cardiac death, a major problem in cardiology.
Enprofylline, a recently developed xanthine derivative, is a more potent bronchodilator than theophylline. This study compares the efficacy and safety of enprofylline with theophylline for chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) in elderly subjects. The study was of a randomized double-blind parallel design and commenced with a 1-week reference period when oral bronchodilators were withdrawn. Patients were then treated with either enprofylline or theophylline 150 mg bd for 2 weeks (period 1) followed by 300 mg bd for a further 3 weeks (period 2). Patients recorded peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and adverse experiences, if any, in a diary, daily. Of 111 patients recruited for the study, 85 entered active treatment (theophylline, n = 44; enprofylline, n = 41). Mean age was 72 years and mean bronchodilator reversibility was 22%. Enprofylline increased mean morning PEFR by 11% (period 1) and 19% (period 2) whereas theophylline increased PEFR by 13% and 19%, respectively. From the enprofylline group 29% were withdrawn from the study due mainly to headache and nausea/vomiting and from the theophylline group 7% were withdrawn due mainly to nausea/vomiting. Mean plasma concentrations of enprofylline were 2.0 mg l-1 and 3.4 mg l-1, and with theophylline 5.4 mg l-1 and 10.0 mg l-1 at the end of periods 1 and 2, respectively. Enprofylline and theophylline produced similar improvements in lung functions and symptoms of chronic obstructive airways disease, but enprofylline was less well tolerated than theophylline.
Contact hypersensitivity (CHS) is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction which is mediated by hapten-specific T cells. Strong haptens, such as 2, 4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) can induce it. Grape seed proanthocyanidins extract (GSPs), which is an antioxidant derived from grape seeds, has been reported to possess a variety of potent properties. However, few reports demonstrated the effects of GSPs on contact hypersensitivity. Therefore, the present study was devised to describe the role of GSPs on a mouse model of experimental CHS induced by DNFB and try to explore the possible underlying mechanisms. We observed that, GSPs when orally administrated into the CHS mice, inhibited the aggravation of inflammation. After administration of GSPs, there was obvious fewer inflammatory cell infiltration in the inflamed ears. Ear swelling after challenge was significantly reduced. In addition, we investigated the effects of GSPs on T cells in vitro, which play critical role during the progress of CHS. It was found that GSPs inhibited proliferative activity of T cells by blocking the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and NF-кB signaling pathways. Collectively, these results showed that GSPs has protective effect on CHS induced by DNFB and it also could inhibit the proliferation ability of T cells in vitro, suggesting the potential of GSPs as new and effective compound for the treatment of T-cell mediated inflammatory diseases.
Consistent but indirect evidence has implicated genetic factors in smoking behavior. We report meta-analyses of several smoking phenotypes within cohorts of the Tobacco and Genetics Consortium (n = 74,053). We also partnered with the European Network of Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology (ENGAGE) and Oxford-GlaxoSmithKline (Ox-GSK) consortia to follow up the 15 most significant regions (n > 140,000). We identified three loci associated with number of cigarettes smoked per day. The strongest association was a synonymous 15q25 SNP in the nicotinic receptor gene CHRNA3 (rs1051730[A], beta = 1.03, standard error (s.e.) = 0.053, P = 2.8 x 10(-73)). Two 10q25 SNPs (rs1329650[G], beta = 0.367, s.e. = 0.059, P = 5.7 x 10(-10); and rs1028936[A], beta = 0.446, s.e. = 0.074, P = 1.3 x 10(-9)) and one 9q13 SNP in EGLN2 (rs3733829[G], beta = 0.333, s.e. = 0.058, P = 1.0 x 10(-8)) also exceeded genome-wide significance for cigarettes per day. For smoking initiation, eight SNPs exceeded genome-wide significance, with the strongest association at a nonsynonymous SNP in BDNF on chromosome 11 (rs6265[C], odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.04-1.08, P = 1.8 x 10(-8)). One SNP located near DBH on chromosome 9 (rs3025343[G], OR = 1.12, 95% Cl 1.08-1.18, P = 3.6 x 10(-8)) was significantly associated with smoking cessation.
