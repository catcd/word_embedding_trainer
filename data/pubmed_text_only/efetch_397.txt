'Double-blind' studies were carried out to assess the incidence of immediate adverse reactions to different doses of a slow-release preparation of isoniazid (matrix isoniazid). Individual doses of 30 mg/kg matrix isoniazid were well-tolerated but higher doses resulted in giddiness, the incidence being dose-related. The giddiness was characterized by a late onset and was usually present even at 24 hours. A few patients complained of gastro-intestinal symptoms. It is concluded that matrix isoniazid can be given to Madras patients in doses of 30-40 mg/kg without risk of an undue incidence of immediate adverse reactions.
Osteoporosis is a chronic disorder that warrants long-term therapy. If benefits are to outweigh risks, the long-term safety profiles of these therapies must be favorable. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of raloxifene over 8 years in 4011 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in a clinical trial setting through adverse event reporting.
Data analyzed comprised all reported adverse events collected at each visit of both the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) trial, and the subsequent Continuing Outcomes Relevant to Evista (CORE) trial. MORE was an international, 4-year double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, designed to assess the effect of raloxifene on bone mineral density and vertebral fracture incidence in 7705 (placebo, 2576; raloxifene, 5129) postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Breast cancer was a secondary endpoint. Based on the breast cancer findings of MORE, the CORE trial, a 4-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a subset of MORE participants, was subsequently conducted. CORE enrolled 4011 (placebo, 1286; raloxifene, 2725) participants and was designed to examine raloxifene's effect on breast cancer incidence. Safety analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat principle, and comparison between therapies was analyzed using a two-sided Fisher's exact test.
Over the 8 years of follow-up of 4011 women, there was no difference in all-cause mortality or hospitalization incidence between raloxifene and placebo groups (p > 0.1). Excluding breast cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer, cancer incidence was 4.6% and 6.3% in the raloxifene and placebo group, respectively (p = 0.027). Raloxifene was associated with a 1.7-fold increase in venous thromboembolism incidence (95% confidence interval 0.93-3.14), with an absolute risk difference of 0.9 per 1000 woman-years. There was no difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, uterine cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, ovarian cancer or postmenopausal bleeding between the raloxifene and placebo treatment groups (p > 0.5). Uterine polyps, hot flushes and muscle cramps were more common in those receiving raloxifene versus placebo (p = 0.028, p < 0.001, and p = 0.008, respectively).
These 8-year data support the known clinical safety profile of raloxifene, established in the MORE trial.
HIV-disease as well as chronic cocaine abuse may both produce neuropsychological deficits that could potentially interfere with psychoeducational treatments for drug abuse. In this study, the Neuropsychological Impairment Scale (NIS), a 95-item self-report assessment instrument, was administered to 120 cocaine-dependent methadone-maintained patients (59 HIV-seropositive; 61 seronegative) to assess self-awareness of cognitive deficits in this patient population. HIV-seropositive cocaine users reported significantly more impairment than did HIV-seronegative cocaine users on all summary scores and six of seven clinical subscales. Controlling for the influence of sociodemographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity, and education), acute and chronic cocaine use, and effective distress, there was still a significant relationship between HIV status and self-report of neuropsychological impairment. Relative to patients with known neuropsychological deficits, 41% of HIV-seropositive cocaine users and 31% of HIV-seronegative cocaine users scored in the impaired range on the Global Impairment Index. Implications for treatment are discussed.
Ovarian cancer cells are usually initially sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, such as cisplatin (CDDP), but typically become resistant over time. Such drug resistance is a serious impediment to successful disease treatment, and the molecular mechanisms responsible for resistance are not fully understood. In search of novel mechanisms that may lead to the development of CDDP chemoresistance, we used subtractive hybridization to identify differentially expressed genes in CDDP resistant CP70 and C200 cells vs. CDDP sensitive A2780 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells. We analyzed 256 randomly selected clones. Subtraction efficiency was determined by dot blot and DNA sequencing. Confirmation of differentially expressed cDNAs was done by virtual northern blot analysis, and 17 genes that were differentially expressed in CDDP resistant cell lines vs. CDDP sensitive A2780 cells were identified. The expression of 10 of these genes was low or undetectable in sensitive A2780 cells in comparison to resistant cells and an additional seven genes were more highly expressed in resistant CP70 and C200 vs. A2780 cells. Our identified genes are involved in numerous and diverse cellular processes, such as inhibition of apoptosis (ARHGDIB), stress response (HSPCA, TRA1), chromatin condensation (CNAP1, RanBP2), invasiveness of cells (MMP10), alteration of Ca(2+) homeostasis (ASPH, ATP2B1) and others. Further characterization of these genes and gene products should yield important insights into the biology of CDDP resistance in ovarian carcinoma.
Numerous case reports in the literature describe adverse drug events associated with immediate-release nifedipine (IRN). In addition, several publications alerted health care professionals regarding the agent. However, it is still administered, and adverse reactions are still reported. Our patient suffered IRN-induced hypotension, myocardial ischemia, and mental status changes. We recommend that the use of IRN in treatment of hypertension should be either totally prohibited or severely restricted. The product should not be readily available for indiscriminate administration. Also, continuing education and training are required to alert all health care professionals to the serious dangers associated with this drug.
The role of the renin--angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure during halothane anesthesia and sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced hypotension was evaluated. Control rats received halothane anesthesia (1 MAC) for one hour, followed by SNP infusion, 40 microgram/kg/min, for 30 min, followed by a 30-min recovery period. A second group of rats was treated identically and, in addition, received an infusion of saralasin (a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II) throughout the experimental period. In each group, SNP infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 torr and 83 torr, respectively, to 48 torr. During the SNP infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive increase in blood pressure to 61 torr, whereas the saralasin-treated animals showed no change. Following discontinuation of SNP, blood pressure in the control animals rebounded to 94 torr, as compared with 78 torr in the saralasin-treated rats. This study indicates that with stable halothane anesthesia, the partial recovery of blood pressure during SNP infusion and the post-SNP rebound of blood pressure can be completely blocked by saralasin. This demonstrates the participation of the renin--angiotensin system in antagonizing the combined hypotensive effects of halothane and SNP.
Research has revealed associative learning deficits among users of ecstasy; the present study explored the component processes underlying these deficits.
Thirty-five ecstasy users and 62 non-ecstasy users completed a computer-based, verbal paired-associates learning task. Participants attempted to learn eight sequentially presented word pairs. After all eight had been presented, the first member of each pair was displayed and participants attempted to recall the second. Eight trials were administered. Correct responses on each trial, forgetting at various levels of learning, perseveration errors and the rate at which the associations were learned (trials to completion) were all recorded.
MANOVA revealed that ecstasy users performed worse overall and subsequent ANOVAs showed that users performed significantly worse on virtually all measures. Regression analysis revealed that over half of the ecstasy-group related variance in trials to completion was attributable to group differences in initial learning and forgetting. In relation to forgetting, it appears that cannabis use may be an important determinant. In relation to rate of learning (trials to completion) and initial learning, both ecstasy and cannabis may be implicated.
There appears to be abundant evidence of associative learning deficits among ecstasy users. However, it appears that a range of illicit drugs including cannabis and ecstasy may contribute to these deficits.
Function in society can be severely affected by disruptive behaviors in adults.
To examine the efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of disruptive behavior disorders in intellectually disabled adults.
Intellectually disabled patients with disruptive behavior disorder were randomly assigned to receive risperidone (n = 39) in a flexible dosage ranging from 1 to 4 mg/day (mean dosage, 1.45+/-0.08 mg/day) or placebo (n = 38) for 4 weeks of double-blind treatment. Efficacy at endpoint was measured primarily by using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC); secondary efficacy measures included the Behavior Problems Inventory and Clinical Global Impressions scales. After this 4-week period, patients could enter open-label treatment with risperidone for 48 weeks.
Risperidone was well tolerated, and patients treated with risperidone demonstrated significantly greater improvement at endpoint on the ABC than those who received placebo [-27.3 points (52.8% improvement) versus -14.9 points (31.3% improvement); P = 0.036] and also improved on Behavior Problems Inventory and Clinical Global Impressions ratings. Over the 48-week, open-label follow-up period, there was a further decrease of 6.3 points (P < or = 0.05) on the ABC for patients who initially received risperidone and a decrease of 11.3 points (P < or = 0.05) for patients who initially received placebo and were switched to open-label risperidone. These results were achieved with a mean modal dosage of 1.8 mg/day.
Risperidone is efficacious and well tolerated in managing disruptive behavior disorders in adults with intellectual disability.
The current study evaluates the efficacy of Balsamodendron mukul Hook ex. Stocks, an indigenous plant, in the modulation of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) treated and ultraviolet (UV) light irradiated tumor promotional events. BPO is a well-known tumor promoter while UV radiations are capable of acting as complete carcinogens. Treatment of the dorsal portions of the mice skins with BPO (20 mg/0.2 ml/animal) and subsequent UV irradiation (0.420 J/m(2)/s) caused a significant depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), it's metabolizing and phase II enzymes (p < 0.01). Also, down regulation of the activities of antioxidant enzymes and up regulation of ornithine decarboxylase activity and enhancement in the synthesis of DNA, malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was observed. However, topical pretreatment with the extract of B. mukul not only restored the content of GSH, MDA and H(2)O(2) but it also recovered the activities of above-mentioned enzymes (p < 0.05) and prevented synthesis of DNA (p < 0.05) significantly. Although the lower dose was not very effective, the higher dose showed promising results against oxidative stress and hyperproliferative response of BPO and UVB radiations. From the present data we conclude that B. mukul is potentially strong enough to modulate the events of skin tumor promotion.
To investigate the effect of edaravone on expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and neuron apoptosis in the juvenile rat hippocampus after status convulsion (SC).
One hundred and ninety-five juvenile male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into normal saline (NS) control group, status convulsive group and edaravone treatment group. Each group was further divided into five subgroups for different time points. The rats in status convulsive group were kindled into epilepsy by lithium-pilocarpine chemical method. Expressions of IL-1beta and NF-kappaB proteins were detected with immunohistochemistry methods. Expression of NF-kappaB mRNA was detected with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The neuron apoptosis was observed by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL).
(1) Measured by immunohistochemistry the value of IOD of IL-1beta (30.83 +/- 3.81, 41.00 +/- 5.61, 36.32 +/- 6.78 and 28.48 +/- 4.61, respectively, 12-72 h points) and NF-kappaB (67.60 +/- 5.81, 74.61 +/- 7.94, 82.43 +/- 10.67, 70.70 +/- 5.85 and 68.22 +/- 9.67, respectively, 4-72 h points) positive cells in the SC group increased,there was significant difference compared with NS group (IL-1beta: 11.74 +/- 2.32, 12.93 +/- 2.49, 13.02 +/- 2.83 and 12.98 +/- 5.29, respectively, 12-72 h points. NF-kappaB: 48.67 +/- 16.14, 44.62 +/- 7.82, 53.16 +/- 114.45, 54.27 +/- 5.25 and 55.56 +/- 7.56, respectively, 4-72 h points) (P < 0.01, or P < 0.05). By ED intervention in IL-1beta (22.01 +/- 4.45, 28.28 +/- 4.50 and 26.00 +/- 5.34, respectively, 12-48 h points) and NF-kappaB (58.56 +/- 6.37, 59. 86 +/- 6.73, 70.00 +/- 10.09, 64.78 +/- 7.56 and 64.45 +/- 6.51, respectively, 4-72 h points) positive cells value of the IOD decreased as compared with SC group (P < 0.01, or P < 0.05). (2) Measured by RT-PCR, the expression of NF-KB mRNA and protein trend was similar. (3)The TUNEL positive cells in hippocampus, CA1 of SC group (11.41 +/- 2.37) were more than that of NS group 12 h after the SC (P < 0.01), reached its highest level at48 h (28.78 +/- 5.11), after the intervention with edaravone (8.98 +/- 2.22, 13.09 +/- 2.54 and 20. 57 +/- 4.89, respectively, 12-48 h points) ,TUNEL positive cells showed a significant drop in SC group at 12-48 h time points (P < 0.01, or P < 0.05), but still significantly higher than that of the NS group (6.22 +/- 1.50, 6.57 +/- 1.61 and 6.72 +/- 1.14, respectively) (P < 0.01, or P < 0.05), at the 4 h time point(NS group 6.29 +/- 1.49, SC group 6.61 +/- 1.71, ED group 5.75 +/- 1.41) among the three groups, no significant difference in TUNEL positive cells was found (P = 0.759).
Edaravone inhibited expression of IL-1beta and NF-kappaB in pilocarpine-induced seizures in rat hippocampus, reduced the number of neuronal apoptosis. These results suggest that edaravone may have protective effect against the damage caused by status convulsion.
QT prolongation, a risk factor for arrhythmias, can result from genetic variants in one (or more) of the genes governing cardiac repolarization as well as intake of drugs known to affect a cardiac K(+) channel encoded by human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG). In this paper, we will report a case of drug-induced long QT syndrome associated with an H(1)-receptor antagonist, hydroxyzine, in which a mutation was identified in the HERG gene. After taking 75 mg of hydroxyzine for several days, a 34-year-old female began to experience repetitive syncope. The deleterious effect of hydroxyzine was suspected because QTc interval shortened from 630 to 464 ms after cessation of the drug. Later on, the patient was found to harbor an A614V-HERG mutation. By using the patch-clamp technique in the heterologous expression system, we examined the functional outcome of the A614V mutation and confirmed a dominant-negative effect on HERG expression. Hydroxyzine concentration-dependently inhibited both wild-type (WT) and WT/A614V-HERG K(+) currents. Half-maximum block concentrations of WT and WT/A614V-HERG K(+) currents were 0.62 and 0.52 microM, respectively. Thus, accidental combination of genetic mutation and intake of hydroxyzine appeared to have led to a severe phenotype, probably, syncope due to torsade de pointes.
Pentamidine isethionate, an important agent used to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, has been shown to be associated with the development of torsades de pointes in patients with AIDS. We have described a case of pentamidine-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia in a renal transplant recipient whose renal insufficiency may have prolonged the duration of arrhythmias. Careful ECG monitoring should be done during pentamidine administration, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. Physicians should be aware that this variety of polymorphous ventricular tachycardia can occur well within the recommended dose of pentamidine. More data are needed to define the relationship between renal dysfunction, plasma levels, and pentamidine cardiotoxicity.
To clarify the involvement of cytochromeP450 (CYP) 3A4 in the metabolism of haloperidol and bromperidol in humans, the effects of itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, on steady-state plasma concentrations of both drugs and their reduced metabolites were investigated using 21 schizophrenic patients. Patients treated with haloperidol 12 or 24 mg/day (n = 13) or bromperidol 12 or 24 mg/day (n = 8) for at least 2 weeks were then given itraconazole 200 mg/day for 7 days. Blood samplings were performed before administration, 1 week during itraconazole coadministration and 1 week after its discontinuation together with clinical assessments. Plasma concentrations of haloperidol and bromperidol and their reduced metabolites were significantly higher during itraconazole treatment (P < 0.01). Deterioration in the neurological side effects of haloperidol was observed during itraconazole coadministration. Thus, this study suggests that itraconazole inhibits the metabolism of haloperidol and bromperidol, and that CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of both drugs.
Five and half years male child with one day history of pain abdomen and vomiting who was on aspirin for suspected rheumatoid arthritis presented initially with acute gastritis. Next day, however he developed the signs of encephalopathy with altered liver function.
A double-blind, crossover trial was conducted to examine the effect of albuterol aerosol on the fine-motor performance of children with chronic asthma. Twenty subjects, 4 1/2 to 14 1/2 years of age, were each tested after both the administration of albuterol aerosol and a placebo. The fine-motor composite of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency was used to evaluate abilities in response speed, visual-motor control, and speed and dexterity. The degree of tremor was tested with a "steadiness" tester, and postural adjustment was recorded on a clinical rating scale. No significant differences were found in fine-motor skills after albuterol or placebo administration, but a significant increase in tremor as well as in postural adjustment occurred after albuterol. The effect of test order and several other patient characteristics on test scores may be related to these findings. Major educational adjustments to compensate for the increase in tremor are unnecessary.
Cadmium (Cd) is both an environmental pollutant and a component of cigarette smoke. Although evidence demonstrates that adult exposure to Cd causes changes in the immune system, there are limited reports in the literature of immunomodulatory effects of prenatal exposure to Cd. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways are required for thymocyte maturation. Several studies have demonstrated that Cd exposure affects these pathways in different organ systems. This study was designed to investigate the effect of prenatal Cd exposure on thymocyte development, and to determine if these effects were linked to dysregulation of Shh and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. Pregnant C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to an environmentally relevant dose (10 ppm) of Cd throughout pregnancy and effects on the thymus were assessed on the day of birth. Thymocyte phenotype was determined by flow cytometry. A Gli:luciferase reporter cell line was used to measure Shh signaling. Transcription of target genes and translation of key components of both signaling pathways were assessed using real-time RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Prenatal Cd exposure increased the number of CD4(+) cells and a subpopulation of double-negative cells (DN; CD4(-)CD8(-)), DN4 (CD44(-)CD25(-)). Shh and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling were both decreased in the thymus. Target genes of Shh (Patched1 and Gli1) and Wnt/beta-catenin (c-fos, and c-myc) were affected differentially among thymocyte subpopulations. These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to Cd dysregulates two signaling pathways in the thymus, resulting in altered thymocyte development.
Linezolid is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Some reports have shown that linezolid treatment for more than 2 weeks has been associated with reversible bone marrow suppression, especially thrombocytopenia and anemia. We encountered a case of sideroblastic anemia following prolonged linezolid therapy in a laryngeal cancer patient. He received linezolid therapy for multiple abscesses due to MRSA. Before treatment, the Hb level was 12.5 g/dl and then slowly decreased to 5.9 g/dl for 2 months during treatment. Ringed sideroblasts were detected in the bone marrow. Linezolid was discontinued and the Hb level was slowly increased. This case was considered to reflect a rare complication of linezolid therapy.
High doses of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine are a useful model for investigation of the essential mechanisms for seizure generation and spread in rodents. Pilocarpine (400 mg/kg; subcutaneously) was administered in 2-month-old female rats, and the content of striatum monoamines and (M(1)+M(2)) muscarinic and D(2) dopaminergic receptors was measured in the acute period. All treated animals showed peripheral cholinergic signs, stereotyped and clonic movements, tremors, seizures and the percentage mortality was approximately 63%. High performance liquid chromatography determinations, performed 24 h later, showed a decrease of striatal levels of dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Pilocarpine treatment induced downregulation of (M(1)+M(2)) muscarinic receptors and reduced the dissociation constants of (M(1)+M(2)) muscarinic and D(2) dopaminergic receptors, suggesting that these systems exert opposite effects on the regulation of convulsive activity. These and other important neurochemical changes found in the course of establishment of an epileptic focus can be observed after status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine.
In order to evaluate tumor enhancing effects of the heterocyclic carcinogen, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), doses of 100 and 300 p.p.m. PhIP were given for 40 weeks to male F344 rats, which initially received 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB). DMAB shows a similar carcinogenic organ spectrum to that of PhIP, including the prostate and colon. PhIP alone at a dose of 300 p.p.m. resulted in the development of prostate and intestine cancers. Furthermore, among the DMAB-treated group, enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by 300 p.p.m. PhIP was observed. However, no prostate enhancement was demonstrated in the DMAB + PhIP group. Since PhIP-DNA adduct formation in the prostate epithelial cells in a satellite experiment was not affected by pre-treatment with DMAB, it is speculated that the contradictory findings between the intestine and prostate may be due to the specific biological effects of PhIP. Taking into account previous data, that PhIP clearly enhanced rat 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-initiated colon tumorigenesis, the potential of PhIP to enhance colon carcinogenesis may be initiator dependent.
Hypertension is often associated with impaired glucose tolerance and high insulin levels, factors that contribute to insulin resistance. The present study evaluates the effect of acarbose, a hypoglycemic drug that inhibits carbohydrate digestion in sucrose-induced hypertension in rats. The effects of diets fed to 3 groups of rats for a 16-week period were studied: sucrose + NaCl (1% wet volume [w/v]) with acarbose (0.04% wet weight [w/w]), sucrose + NaCl (1% w/v) without acarbose, and a third diet of complex carbohydrates. There was no statistical difference in the body weight between rats fed with or without acarbose. Fasting glucose levels were significantly lowered when treated with acarbose. Postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels were attenuated in rats fed sucrose + acarbose. Systolic blood pressure increased significantly (p < 0.001) in rats fed sucrose + NaCl for 3 months, whereas systolic blood pressure of acarbose-fed rats remained at the initial level. Blood pressure changes in the complex carbohydrate-fed group were lower than in rats fed sucrose. The urinary volume, Na+, and K+ of rats fed acarbose tended to increase compared to the acarbose-free diet (p < 0.05). We conclude that high insulin levels, impaired glucose tolerance and Na+ retention may contribute to the development of sucrose-induced hypertension. Acarbose prevents sucrose-induced increases in plasma glucose and insulin levels. Increases in urinary Na + may contribute indirectly to this effect with resultant normal systolic blood pressures.
Present studies demonstrate that treatment with arsenic trioxide (AT) lowered ectopically expressed or endogenous levels of Bcr-Abl protein, as well as induced apoptosis of Bcr-Abl-expressing cultured and primary chronic myeloid leukemia cells, including those refractory to imatinib mesylate. Treatment with AT neither affected bcr-abl mRNA transcript levels nor promoted the proteasomal degradation of Bcr-Abl. Importantly, in [(35)S]methionine-labeled leukemia cells, exposure to AT rapidly lowered the levels of the newly synthesized Bcr-Abl, indicating inhibition of bcr-abl mRNA translation. Treatment with AT rapidly inhibited the activity of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, as well as of p70 S6 kinase-1. p70 S6 kinase-1 is known to be a positive regulator of the translation of a group of mRNAs that possesses a long and highly structured 5'-untranslated region (UTR) containing a tract of oligopyrimidines (TOP). Because bcr-abl mRNA was discovered to possess a long and highly structured 5'-UTR containing a 12-pyrimidine TOP sequence in its 5'-UTR, we determined the effect of AT in Jurkat cells with ectopic expression of a 5'-UTR-deleted mutant of the bcr-abl gene, i.e., Jurkat/Bcr-Abl (5'UTR-) cells. Treatment with AT neither lowered the levels of the 5'-UTR-deleted mutant of Bcr-Abl nor induced apoptosis of Jurkat/Bcr-Abl (5'UTR-) cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which AT down-regulates Bcr-Abl levels and induces apoptosis of Bcr-Abl-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.
Nevirapine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used as part of combination antiretroviral therapy, can cause mild elevations in transaminase levels. Severe elevations in transaminase levels related to the use of nevirapine developed in 4 patients. Data on these patients were extracted via chart review, and a review of the literature was also completed. Nevirapine-induced hepatitis occurred shortly after drug initiation in patients with and without preexisting liver disease. Significant elevations in liver enzyme levels occurred but resolved promptly in most with discontinuation of the nevirapine. Close monitoring of liver enzyme levels in the early period after starting nevirapine is essential.
In light of evidence that some complications of diabetes mellitus may be caused or exacerbated by an oxidative stress, the putative protective effect of Eucalyptus globulus, a medicinal plant, was investigated in alloxan-diabetic rats. E. globulus extract was given in drinking water for 15 days at a daily dose equivalent to 130 mg dry leaves/kg of body weight. Lipids peroxidation level and activities of catalase, superoxide-dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were then measured in liver and kidney. Under our experimental conditions, eucalyptus extract was found to significantly reduce the blood glucose level in diabetic animals but failed to restore the liver glycogen level, whereas insulin lowered blood glucose and restored liver glycogen to high concentration. Our results suggest that the antihyperglycemic action of eucalyptus extract is not exerted via the stimulation of insulin secretion but rather unveil a proper effect of the extract involving the enhancement of peripheral glucose uptake. In addition, eucalyptus extract appears to exert an antioxidative activity demonstrated (1) by the increase of catalase, superoxide-dismutase and gluthatione-peroxidase activities in liver and kidney, and (2) a lowering of lipids peroxidation level in these organs. In conclusion, the present study indicates that extract of E. globulus, administered per os, could be used with some profit in diabetic patients.
Elucidating the molecular drivers of human breast cancers requires a strategy that is capable of integrating multiple forms of data and an ability to interpret the functional consequences of a given genetic aberration. Here we present an integrated genomic strategy based on the use of gene expression signatures of oncogenic pathway activity (n = 52) as a framework to analyze DNA copy number alterations in combination with data from a genome-wide RNA-mediated interference screen. We identify specific DNA amplifications and essential genes within these amplicons representing key genetic drivers, including known and new regulators of oncogenesis. The genes identified include eight that are essential for cell proliferation (FGD5, METTL6, CPT1A, DTX3, MRPS23, EIF2S2, EIF6 and SLC2A10) and are uniquely amplified in patients with highly proliferative luminal breast tumors, a clinical subset of patients for which few therapeutic options are effective. This general strategy has the potential to identify therapeutic targets within amplicons through an integrated use of genomic data sets.
