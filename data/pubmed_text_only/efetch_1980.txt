To investigate the source of the apparent increased susceptibility of women to develop QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes after the administration of drugs that delay cardiac repolarization.
Plasma quinidine concentrations and electrocardiographic changes (QRS and QT intervals) were measured over 24 h following the administration of single oral doses of the QT prolonging drug quinidine (3 mg kg(-1)) and compared between 27 male and 21 female healthy volunteers.
There were no significant differences between males and females in plasma quinidine concentrations or in calculated pharmacokinetic variables. Maximum quinidine concentrations in males and females were 997 +/- 56 and 871 +/- 57 ng ml(-1), respectively (mean difference (-125, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -239, 11 ng ml(-1), P = NS). Quinidine lengthened actual (QTa) and corrected (QTc) QT intervals and the QRS interval to a greater extent in females than males (P < 0.001 for each), but there were no significant sex differences detected in the effects of quinidine on the heart rate corrected JT interval. Maximum prolongation of QTc interval was observed 2 h after quinidine and was significantly greater in women (33 +/- 16 vs 24 +/- 17 ms, mean difference 9 +/- 20 ms, 95% CI 3, 15, P = 0.037). At this time mean differences (95% CI) were 1.0 min(-1) (-2.5, 4.4, P = NS) for heart rate, 5.5 ms (3.5, 7.6, P = 0.05) for the QRS and 3.4 ms (-2.5, 9.3, P = NS) for the JTc intervals.
Quinidine-induced increases in QTc were larger in females, but no sex differences in quinidine pharmacokinetics were found. The disparity in prolongation of cardiac repolarization is thus due to a pharmacodynamic difference which appears more complex than simply an increase in repolarization delay in females.
The biochemical and behavioral effects of the putative dopamine autoreceptor antagonists cis-(+)-5-methoxy-1-methyl-2-(n-propylamino)tetralin, (+)-AJ 76 and cis-(+)-5-methoxy-1-methyl-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, (+)-UH 232, were evaluated in various in vivo models in rats. Both compounds produced a marked elevation in brain dopamine synthesis and turnover with only slight effects on the synthesis and turnover of serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline being noted. (+)-AJ 76 and (+)-UH 232 also failed to antagonize the decrease in cortical noradrenaline synthesis rate caused by the alpha 2 agonist clonidine. The apomorphine-induced decrease in dopamine synthesis rate in gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) treated animals was completely blocked by (+)-AJ 76 and (+)-UH 232 but not by d-amphetamine or methylphenidate. In activity experiments using habituated animals, (+)-AJ 76 and (+)-UH 232 produced locomotor stimulation and weak stereotypies and antagonized the sedative effects of low doses of apomorphine. Locomotor hyperactivity induced by apomorphine or the dopamine agonist DiPr-5,6-ADTN was antagonized by (+)-UH 232 and to a lesser degree by (+)-AJ 76. The locomotor hyperactivity produced by (+)-AJ 76, (+)-UH 232 and methylphenidate was completely prevented by reserpine pretreatment and partially blocked by the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (alpha-MT), whereas d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was only antagonized by alpha-MT pretreatment. It is concluded that (+)-AJ 76 and (+)-UH 232 produce behavioral stimulation via a preferential antagonism on central dopamine autoreceptors, an action different from that of all known stimulants including apomorphine, d-amphetamine and methylphenidate. (+)-AJ 76 and (+)-UH 232 possess but weak antagonistic effects on postsynaptic dopamine receptors and only the latter compound is able to induce sedation in rats.
Transforming growth factor (TGF)- beta1, metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP)-1 are considered predictive biomarkers of chronic hepatitis activity and fibrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of lamivudine treatment on the plasma levels of these peptides in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
TGF-beta1, MMP-1 and TIMP-1 plasma concentrations were measured with an enzyme immunoassay in 40 patients treated with lamivudine for 48 wk. Elimination of HBV-DNA and HBV antigens was evaluated 24 wk after treatment completion.
Baseline TGF-beta1 (29.6+/-2.2 ng/mL) and TIMP-1 (1 578+/-93 ng/mL) significantly exceeded normal values (18.3+/-1.6 ng/mL and 1 102+/-67 ng/mL respectively). Lamivudine treatment resulted in a significant decrease of TGF-beta1 and TIMP-1 during treatment with an increase after 24 wk of treatment. Pretreatment MMP-1 levels (6.7+/-0.7 ng/mL) were significantly lower than normal values (11.9+/-0.9 ng/mL) and increased during treatment and follow-up. A significant correlation was noted between TGF-beta1 or TIMP-1 and aminotransferases as well as fibrosis scored in liver biopsy specimens. There were no statistically significant differences of TGF-beta1, TIMP-1 and MMP-1 between four groups at baseline, 24 and 48 wk of treatment. TGF-beta1 and TIMP-1 levels increased significantly in non-responders and normalized in responders at wk 72. MMP-1 also normalized in responders and decreased to values significantly lower than normal in non-responders.
These findings support the role of TGF-beta1, TIMP-1 and MMP-1 in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B. Because of their association with hepatic injury and antiviral treatment efficacy, determination of these peptides may be useful in disease management.
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive or X-linked disorder characterized by aplastic anemia, cancer susceptibility and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Eight FA proteins (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL and FANCM) and three non-FA proteins (FAAP100, FAAP24 and HES1) form an FA nuclear core complex, which is required for monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI dimer upon DNA damage. FANCL possesses a PHD/RING-finger domain and is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit of the core complex. In this study, we report an FA patient with an unusual presentation belonging to the FA-L complementation group. The patient lacks an obvious FA phenotype except for the presence of a cafÃ©-au-lait spot, mild hypocellularity and a family history of leukemia. The molecular diagnosis and identification of the FA subgroup was achieved by FA complementation assay. We identified bi-allelic novel mutations in the FANCL gene and functionally characterized them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported case belonging to the FA-L complementation group.
Lipoprotein-lipase activity was determined in tissue from the skeletal muscle of the leg and the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the abdomen in fourteen patients before and after 1 month of clofibrate administration. The concentrations of serum triglycerides decreased by, on the average, 37% in a group of thirteen patients which mainly consisted of subjects with type-IV hyperlipoproteinaemia. Clofibrate administration was associated with an average increase of the skeletal muscle-tissue lipoprotein-lipase activity of 50% (P less than 0.005). There was a significant correlation between the percentage changes in skeletal muscle-tissue lipoprotein-lipase activity and those of the triglycerides concentrations and the K2-values in an intravenous fat tolerance test during clofibrate treatment. Adipose-tissue lipoprotein-lipase activity did not change significantly. One patient with type-I hyperlipoproteinaemia had very low values of skeletal muscle-tissue lipoprotein-lipase activity and moderately low adipose-tissue lipoprotein-lipase activity. In this patient, neither the tissue lipoprotein-lipase activity nor the triglycerides concentration changed during clofibrate therapy. Fasting serum insulin concentrations decreased significantly during clofibrate administration and the percentage decrease was significantly correlated to the percentage increase of skeletal-muscle lipoprotein-lipase activity. It is suggested that the lowering of insulin levels is a possible mechanism through which glucagon activity is enhanced and this may increase skeletal muscle-tissue lipoprotein-lipase activity.
A 5-year-old girl with no underlying immune deficiency or hematologic disease was treated with a combination of ceftriaxone and ampicilline-sulbactam for pneumonia. On the ninth day of the therapy, she developed oliguria, paleness, malaise, immune hemolytic anemia (IHA) and acute renal failure (ARF). Laboratory studies showed the presence of antibodies against ceftriaxone. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) was diagnosed by renal biopsy. The patient's renal insufficiency was successfully treated with peritoneal dialysis without any complications. The patient recovered without any treatment using steroids or other immunosuppressive agents.
ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel's function is a key determinant of both excitability and viability of neurons. In the present report, in situ hybridization histochemistry and Western blot were used to examine whether picrotoxin (PTX)-kindling convulsions involved the changes in distribution of K(ATP) channels. The data demonstrated that the formation of kindling state was associated with a decreased amount of Kir6.2 mRNAs and proteins both in cerebral cortex and dentate gyrus (DG) as well as with a decreased amount of (regulatory subunit) SUR 1 mRNAs in DG. In contrast, resulting from a PTX re-induced seizure insult, both subunits were transiently up-modulated but not exactly paralleled between them and among different regions. In DG, Kir6.2 mRNAs increased toward normal levels at 12 h, followed a gradual decrease from 1 day to 3 days, being distinct from that detected in CA1-3 regions in which no significant change was shown. Further, SUR1 mRNAs markedly increased at 12 h, decreased significantly at 1 day, and even went down to a faint level at 3 days which was similar to that of CA1-3 regions, and there was no significant change in CA1-3 regions of SUR1 mRNAs. Also, at 7 days after a PTX re-treatment, Kir6.2 proteins increased significantly in the cortex, CA1, CA3 and DG (increasing 49.52%, 39.36%, 33.41%, and 54.79%, respectively) as well, SUR1 proteins increased significantly in DG (increasing 3.42 times), as compared with kindling rats without PTX retreatments (P < 0.05). These results indicated that K(ATP) channels in brain particularly in DG are likely related to enhanced seizure susceptibility and dynamic controls of seizure propagation of chronic epilepsy induced by PTX in rats.
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated systemic vasculitis is reported mainly in adults. Studies in children are limited. The current study retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and pathology of ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis in children in our hospital during the past 7 years. Twenty-four pediatric patients were diagnosed as having ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis, including 19 patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), one with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), three with propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced ANCA-positive vasculitis and one with anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease. Of patients with primary ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis (MPA and WG), with an average age of 10.8+/-2.8 (6-14) years, 18 patients (90%) were female and two (10%) were male. Nineteen patients (95%) were p-ANCA/MPO-ANCA positive and one (5%) was c-ANCA/PR3-ANCA positive. The interval between onset and diagnosis was 8.5+/-24.3 (0.2-108) months. The majority of the patients (85%) had multi-organ involvement. All patients had clinical evidence of renal involvement and presented with hematuria and proteinuria. Of 20 patients, 16 (80%) also had acute renal failure, and five patients were dialysis dependent. Nine patients underwent renal biopsy and were diagnosed with necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. However, six biopsies showed immune complex deposition. All patients received immunosuppressive therapy including prednisone and cyclophosphamide, and ten patients also received intravenous administration of methylprednisone pulse therapy according to their clinical situation and renal pathology. Sixteen patients achieved clinical remission, and four patients presented as treatment failure. Patients were followed up for 12.3+/-5.1 months (median 12 months; range 1 to 91 months). Ten patients maintained their clinical remission, and ten progressed to renal failure requiring dialysis. Our study showed that the clinical features and pathology of primary ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis in children were similar to those of adults, but there were a predominance of female patients and late diagnoses. We suggest that early recognition and prompt aggressive treatment might improve outcome.
Drug-eluting stents have emerged as a predominant percutaneous strategy in patients with coronary artery disease. However, hypersensitivity reactions caused by their nonerodable polymer coatings and bare-metal stents may result in serious clinical sequelae. In this report, a new biodegradable sirolimus-eluting stent, made from chitosan-based strips fixed by an epoxy compound, coated with a hydrophobic heparin was developed. Due to the covalent crosslinks formed in the stent matrix, the fabricated stent had a shape-memory property to memorize its permanent shape. The shape-memory ability and mechanical strength of the stent could be enhanced by increasing its degree of crosslinking. The cytocompatibility of the stent was demonstrated in vitro. The heparin coating on the stent effectively reduced platelet adhesion; additionally, it acted as a diffusion barrier and led to a nearly linear sustained-release profile of sirolimus. Cell-cycle analysis demonstrated that the released sirolimus could inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation by inducing cell-cycle arrest in G(1) phase. When compared to the unloaded stent, neointimal formation was significantly suppressed after implantation of the sirolimus-eluting stent in rabbit infrarenal abdominal aortas. These findings suggested that the developed sirolimus-eluting polymeric stent can be a potential alternative for treatment of atherosclerosis.
Brain cell-free protein synthesis is inhibited by methyl mercury chloride (MeHg) following in vivo or in vitro administration. In this report, we have identified the locus of mercurial inhibition of translation. Intraperitoneal injection of MeHg (40 nmol/g body wt) induced variable inhibition of amino acid incorporation into the post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) harvested from the brain of young (10-20-day-old) rats. No mercurial-induced disaggregation of brain polyribosomes nor change in the proportion of 80S monoribosomes was detected on sucrose density gradients. No difference in total RNA was found in the PMS. Initiation complex formation was stimulated by MeHg, as detected by radiolabelled methionine binding to 80S monoribosomes following continuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. After micrococcal nuclease digestion of endogenous mRNA, both in vivo and in vitro MeHg inhibited polyuridylic acid-directed incorporation of [3H]phenylalanine. However, the in vivo inhibition was no longer observed when [3H]phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe replaced free [3H]phenylalanine in the incorporation assay. The formation of peptidyl[3H]puromycin revealed no difference from controls. There was significant mercurial inhibition of phenylalanyl-tRNA Phe synthetase activity in pH 5 enzyme fractions derived from brain PMS of MeHg-poisoned rats. These experiments revealed that the apparent MeHg inhibition of brain translation in vivo and in vitro is due primarily to perturbation in the aminoacylation of tRNA and is not associated with defective initiation, elongation, or ribosomal function.
Deprenyl is a selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitor, widely used for treatment of Parkinson's disease. The present study shows that deprenyl treatment was able to improve mitochondrial function. Fourteen month old mice were injected i.p. with deprenyl (20 mg/kg) and killed 1.5 h after the administration. Different brain subcellular fractions were isolated from control and deprenyl-treated animals to evaluate the effect of deprenyl on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Oxygen consumption, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production, mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium-induced permeability transition (MPT) were studied in intact mitochondria. In addition, the effect of deprenyl on respiratory complexes and MAO activities were evaluated in submitochondrial particles (SMP). Monoamine oxidase activity was found to be decreased by 55% in mitochondria from deprenyl-treated animals and as a consequence, H(2)O(2) production was significantly decreased. Deprenyl inhibited NOS activity in cytosolic fractions and SMP by 40% and 55%, respectively. In similar conditions, SMP from deprenyl-treated animals showed increased cytochrome oxidase activity. A 51% increase in the oxygen uptake in state 3 (active respiration state) was found after deprenyl treatment, but no significant changes were observed in state 4 (resting respiration state). Deprenyl treatment protected against calcium-induced depolarization and was able to inhibit calcium-induced MPT. This work provides evidence that deprenyl treatment exerts an improvement of brain mitochondrial function, through a reduction of free radical production, prevention of calcium-induced MPT and maintaining a mitochondrial transmembrane potential.
Gene amplifications and deletions are common changes in human cancer cells. Previous studies indicate that the regions, where the ACHE (7q22) and BCHE (3q26.1-q26.2) genes are localized, are suffering such structural modifications in breast cancer. Therefore, the products of these genes, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, respectively, are related to the process of cell differentiation and proliferation, as well as apoptosis. This study also included two other genes involved in tumorigenesis, the EPHB4 (7q22.1) and MME (3q21-27). The aim of this study was to verify amplification and/or deletion in the ACHE, BCHE, EPHB4 and MME genes in 32 samples of sporadic breast cancer. The gene alterations were detected using real-time PCR and determined by relative quantification with the standard curve method. All samples presented genetic alterations, showing a higher tendency for amplification of the ACHE (62.5% vs. 37.5%; p>0.1) and EPHB4 (53.13% vs. 46.88%; p>0.5) genes, and for deletions of the BCHE and MME genes (56.25% vs. 43.75% for both; p>0.5). A positive correlation was found between alterations in ACHE-EPHB4 and BCHE-MME pairs (r(s) = 0.5948; p = 0.0004; r(s) = 0.3581; p = 0.0478, respectively) indicating that these changes comprise a wide region. In conclusion, the results suggest that these genomic regions may contain important genes for this pathology, such as the oncogenes MET (7q31) and PIK3CA (3q26), and thus being interesting targets for future studies in breast cancer research.
A third case of acquired phosphate diabetes associated with a syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), related to a pulmonary tuberculosis, is reported. Renal hypophosphatemia in this patient was caused by the erroneous intake of 1 g doxycycline. It is likely that the selective nephrotoxicity in these 3 patients with SIADH was induced by tetracycline.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Although miRNAs are highly expressed in the heart, their roles in heart diseases are currently unclear. Using microarray analysis designed to detect the majority of mammalian miRNAs identified thus far, we demonstrated that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in hypertrophic mouse hearts. The time course of the aberrant miRNA expression was further identified in mouse hearts at 7, 14, and 21 days after aortic banding. Nineteen of the most significantly dysregulated miRNAs were further confirmed by Northern blot and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction, in which miR-21 was striking because of its more than fourfold increase when compared with the sham surgical group. Similar aberrant expression of the most up-regulated miRNA, miR-21, was also found in cultured neonatal hypertrophic cardiomyocytes stimulated by angiotensin II or phenylephrine. Modulating miR-21 expression via antisense-mediated depletion (knockdown) had a significant negative effect on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The results suggest that miRNAs are involved in cardiac hypertrophy formation. miRNAs might be a new therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases involving cardiac hypertrophy such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, valvular diseases, and endocrine disorders.
A 59-year-old man was diagnosed with IgA-kappa multiple myeloma in October 2005. He was treated with 4 courses of VAD and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) after 200 mg/m(2) melphalan in September 2006, followed by a second auto-PBSCT after 200 mg/m(2) melphalan in February 2007. However, he did not achieve a very good partial response (VGPR). Laboratory examinations showed increased serum IgA level and renal dysfunction gradually progressed. Bortezomib was then started at a dose of 1.3 mg/m(2) in November 2008. After three cycles of bortezomib, the patient developed numbness, pain and weakness of his upper and lower extremities. The sensation of position and vibration was diminished in the fingers and toes. He developed left foot drop and gait disturbance due to left peroneal nerve palsy. Autonomic dysfunction such as orthostatic hypotension and urinary retention also occurred. Nerve conduction studies showed severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy particularly in the lower extremities. He developed grade 4 motor neuropathy and severe painful neuralgia. Six months after the cessation of bortezomib, these symptoms gradually improved and he was able to walk with support and discharged. Close monitoring of neurological symptoms and prompt dose-reduction or cessation of bortezomib are important to prevent the progression of irreversible peripheral neuropathy.
Clozapine is a newly released antipsychotic that is associated with a higher prevalence of seizures than traditional neuroleptics. The authors describe four patients who developed seizure activity during clozapine treatment and provide recommendations for clinical management of this problem.
Candida albicans frequently inhabits the gastrointestinal tract of humans leading to gastrointestinal candidiasis, especially following suppression of gastric acidity, but studies on the relation between this fungal infection and gastric pathology are limited due to lack of convenient animal models resembling Candida infection in humans. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We compared the effects of C. albicans and vehicle inoculation on gastric secretion and healing of gastric ulcers induced by acetic acid in rats treated with 1) ranitidine (30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) s.c.) and 2) aspirin (ASA) (60 mg kg(-1) day(-1) i.g.) with or without probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophillus. At day 0 and at 4, 15 and 25 days after ulcer induction, the ulcer area, the gastric blood flow (GBF), the quantitative gastric cultures of Candida and the expression of mRNAs for pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and growth factors EGF and TGFalpha were assessed in the gastric mucosa.
Gastric acid output was reduced by over 40% soon after Candida inoculation and this effect persisted during all time intervals tested. The area of ulcers in control rats significantly decreased at day 15 and the ulcers disappeared almost completely after 25 days of their induction. In contrast, the ulcers were present until day 25 in Candida-inoculated rats followed by a fall in GBF and a rise in plasma gastrin levels, these effects being significantly attenuated by the co-treatment with Lactobacillus. Candidiasis was accompanied by up-regulation of mRNA for IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, EGF and TGFalpha and a significant increment in plasma IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels.
1) Persistent colonization with Candida could be achieved in rats treated with antisecretory agents or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ASA; 2) candidiasis reduces gastric acid secretion, while delaying ulcer healing possibly due to the impairment in GBF in the ulcer area and enhanced expression and release of IL-1beta and TNFalpha and 3) probiotic therapy could be useful in the treatment against the deleterious action of fungal infection on the healing of pre-existing gastric ulcers.
Histological, behavioral and electrophysiological studies have suggested that 5-HT may regulate motor function by affecting globus pallidus neurons activity. In this study, the effects of 5-HT in globus pallidus on haloperidol-induced catalepsy and its possible receptor mechanisms were examined in rats using bar tests. Bilateral microinjection of 5-HT (10microM) into globus pallidus significantly attenuated haloperidol-induced catalepsy. This anticataleptic effect was completely counteracted by selective 5-HT(1B) receptors antagonist SB-224289 (10microM), while partly reversed by selective 5-HT(4) receptors antagonist GR-113808 (1microM). In addition, the selective 5-HT(7) receptors antagonist SB-269970 (1microM) partly reversed the anticataleptic effect of 5-HT only at the incipient period after the intrapallidal injection. In conclusion, 5-HT in globus pallidus could attenuate haloperidol-induced catalepsy via multiple receptor mechanisms.
Chronic exposure to elemental metallic mercury may induce an immunological glomerular disease. Since humans are exposed to mercury vapor (Hg0) from dental amalgam restorations and kidney is an important target organ of mercury vapor and mercury deposition in kidney increases proportionally with the dose, our aim was to test the occurrence of specific antibodies to antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM-IgG) among individuals with adverse effects to mercury from dental amalgam fillings. We selected a group of patients (n=24) with a history of long-term exposure to mercury vapor from mercury-containing amalgam fillings and showing adverse effects that were laboratory confirmed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to evaluate serum levels of antibodies to anti-GBM-IgG. None of the patients showed evidence of anti-GBM autoimmunity, either in subgroups with strong allergy to mercury or its compounds (i.e., organic mercury) or in those patients who had past thimerosal-containing vaccines coverage (7 of 24). There was no evidence of the presence of circulating anti-GBM antibodies in subjects suffering from adverse events due to long-term exposure to mercury from dental amalgams, even in individuals who presented allergy to mercury.
Both types of diabetes are associated with higher incidence of some types of cancer. Treating cancer in diabetic patients without aggravating diabetes-related complications is a challenge for clinicians. Additionally, little is known about how diabetes affects the treatment of cancer. One of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs is cisplatin, which is nephrotoxic. Studies suggest that diabetes acts as a protective factor against the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated yet. This renal protection has been attributed to decreased accumulation of cisplatin in the kidneys, which could be associated with deficient active transport of proximal tubular cells or to pharmacokinetic alterations caused by diabetes. However, it is uncertain if diabetes also compromises the antitumor activity of cisplatin. To address this issue, we developed a mouse model bearing cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, Sarcoma 180 and streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Four groups of treatment were defined: (i) control, (ii) diabetic, (iii) cisplatin and (iv) diabetic treated with cisplatin. The following parameters were evaluated: renal function, oxidative stress, apoptosis, renal histopathology, tumor remission, survival rate, genotoxicity and platinum concentration in tumor and several organs. Results indicate that diabetes protects against the renal damage induced by cisplatin, while also compromises its antitumor effectiveness. This is the first study to demonstrate this effect.
Haploinsufficiency for the transcription factor SOX10 is associated with the pigmentary deficiencies of Waardenburg syndrome (WS) and is modeled in Sox10 haploinsufficient mice (Sox10(LacZ/+)). As genetic background affects WS severity in both humans and mice, we established an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen to identify modifiers that increase the phenotypic severity of Sox10(LacZ/+) mice. Analysis of 230 pedigrees identified three modifiers, named modifier of Sox10 neurocristopathies (Mos1, Mos2 and Mos3). Linkage analysis confirmed their locations on mouse chromosomes 13, 4 and 3, respectively, within regions distinct from previously identified WS loci. Positional candidate analysis of Mos1 identified a truncation mutation in a hedgehog(HH)-signaling mediator, GLI-Kruppel family member 3 (Gli3). Complementation tests using a second allele of Gli3 (Gli3(Xt-J)) confirmed that a null mutation of Gli3 causes the increased hypopigmentation in Sox10(LacZ/+);Gli3(Mos1/)(+) double heterozygotes. Early melanoblast markers (Mitf, Sox10, Dct, and Si) are reduced in Gli3(Mos1/)(Mos1) embryos, indicating that loss of GLI3 signaling disrupts melanoblast specification. In contrast, mice expressing only the GLI3 repressor have normal melanoblast specification, indicating that the full-length GLI3 activator is not required for specification of neural crest to the melanocyte lineage. This study demonstrates the feasibility of sensitized screens to identify disease modifier loci and implicates GLI3 and other HH signaling components as modifiers of human neurocristopathies.
One hundred cases of methohexitone activation of the EEG are reported. The technique seems to be especially valuable in the investigation of petit mal and temporal lobe epilepsy and adds valuable negative evidence in cases of suspected behaviour disorders.
