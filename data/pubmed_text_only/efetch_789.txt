Adriblastin was shown to activate considerably lipid peroxidation processes in the heart muscle, mostly through the suppression of antioxidant enzyme (superoxidedysmutase and catalase) activity, with myocardial contractility declining essentially as a result. Pretreatment with the synthetic antioxidant ionol prevented the adriblastin-induced depression of myocardial contractility.
Naringin has been reported to possess diverse pharmacological properties, including anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of the present study was to determine the potential anti-inflammatory effect of naringin in a mouse model of carrageenan-induced pleurisy. A single dose of naringin (40 and 80 mg/kg) was administered per oral (p.o.) 1 h before carrageenan (Cg) administration. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were analysed in pleural fluid. We also assessed the effects of naringin on the expression levels of iNOS, inducible cyclooxygenase isoform (COX-2), ICAM-1, MIP-2, PGE2, STAT3, TGF-β1, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and inhibitor of kappa B (IκBα) in lung tissue. The histological examinations revealed anti-inflammatory effect of naringin while Cg group deteriorated. Naringin downregulated Th1 and upregulated Th2 cytokines. Western blot analyses revealed increased protein expression of NF-κB, STAT3 and COX-2 and decreased IκBα in response to Cg treatment, which were reversed by the treatment with naringin. In the Cg group, mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory mediators upregulated and anti-inflammatory mediators downregulated. Naringin reversed these actions.
The effect of increased brain GABA levels on fully kindled amygdala seizures was investigated in Long-Evans rats. The newly synthesized GABA-transaminase inhibitor, gamma-acetylenic GABA (GAG) administered on four consecutive days (100 mg/kg, followed by 50 mg/kg, i.p.) was found to either significantly reduce, or eliminate entirely, the behavioral seizures normally produced by amygdala stimulation. The effect is seen after the first injection of GAG although its magnitude was greater on subsequent days. Behavioral seizures reappeared 2 to 3 days after termination of GAG treatment. The duration of electrographic seizures (self-sustained amygdala after discharge) was either unchanged or greater on the first day of GAG treatment, but was briefer on subsequent days. The duration of afterdischarges returned to normal levels 1 to 2 days earlier than the behavioral seizures after the termination of GAG. Picrotoxin (1.5-2 mg/kg, i.p.) did not antagonize either electrographic or behavioral effects of inhibition produced with GAG. Electrical stimulation of amygdala delivered during the initial sedation stage induced by picrotoxin resulted in further regression of kindled seizures in the majority of animals. Although in doses employed, GAG alleviates amygdaloid-kindled seizures its use requires caution in view of its ability to reduce arousal level.
Ceftriaxone has potent activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. While it is eliminated mainly by the kidney, 10-20% of the drug is eliminated in the bile and ceftriaxone salt precipitates have been described in the gallbladder of animals dosed with ceftriaxone. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the incidence of biliary lithiasis 6 and 12 months after treatment with ceftriaxone and to compare it with that in patients treated with amoxycillin/clavulanate. Biliary ultrasonography was performed at the start of treatment, at 6 months and at 12 months after the beginning of the study. One hundred patients were randomized and 74 were evaluable: 34 were given amoxycillin/clavulanate, 40 ceftriaxone. Gallbladder lithiasis developed in one patient 12 months after the amoxycillin/clavulanate treatment and in none in the ceftriaxone treatment arm. Biliary precipitate during ceftriaxone treatment was not looked for because this phenomenon was not known at the beginning of the study, but gallbladder precipitation that was seen in two patients given ceftriaxone during and at the end of treatment, respectively, resolved spontaneously. In conclusion, ceftriaxone treatment does not appear to lead to gallstone formation more often than an antibiotic that is not eliminated through the bile.
A 37-year-old man presented with new onset jamais vu episodes. Jamais vu is a mental state characterized by a sense of unfamiliarity in a familiar situation. The patient's episodes of jamais vu were unrelated to any known factor other than his use of baclofen. The episodes, which occurred as each baclofen dose wore off, resolved after the baclofen dose that triggered it was discontinued. The patient has had no recurrence of jamais vu states after discontinuation of his baclofen. This is the first known case report of jamais vu episodes caused by baclofen. Although jamais vu episodes can occur in healthy persons, they are known to occur more frequently in persons with epilepsy, fatigue, psychologic states, or intoxications. This case suggests that medications should be considered as a possible cause of jamais vu episodes.
Improved prevention and treatment of drug addiction will require deeper understanding of genetic factors contributing to susceptibility to excessive drug use. Intravenous operant self-administration methods have greatly advanced understanding of behavioral traits related to addiction. However, these methods are not suitable for large-scale genetic experiments in mice. Selective breeding of mice can aggregate 'addiction alleles' in a model that has the potential to identify coordinated effects of multiple genes. We produced mouse lines that orally self-administer high (MAHDR) or low (MALDR) amounts of methamphetamine, representing the first demonstration of selective breeding for self-administration of any psychostimulant drug. Conditioned place preference and taste aversion results indicate that MAHDR mice are relatively more sensitive to the rewarding effects and less sensitive to the aversive effects of methamphetamine, compared to MALDR mice. These results validate the oral route of self-administration for investigation of the motivational effects of methamphetamine and provide a viable alternative to intravenous self-administration procedures. Gene expression results for a subset of genes relevant to addiction-related processes suggest differential regulation by methamphetamine of apoptosis and immune pathways in the nucleus accumbens of MAHDR and MALDR mice. In each line, methamphetamine reduced an allostatic state by bringing gene expression back toward 'normal' levels. Genes differentially expressed in the drug-naï ve state, including Slc6a4 (serotonin transporter), Htr3a (serotonin receptor 3A), Rela [nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB)] and Fos (cFos), represent candidates whose expression levels may predict methamphetamine consumption and susceptibility to methamphetamine reward and aversion.
The purpose of the present work was to study the pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin, a poorly metabolised drug, in experimental hepatic fibrosis. The possible roles of small intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) in the bioavailability of ofloxacin were also evaluated. Rat hepatic fibrosis model was successfully induced using complex factors including carbon tetrachloride, ethanol and high fat. After rats received a single oral or intravenous dose of ofloxacin (40 mg kg(-1)), the plasma concentrations of ofloxacin were monitored at the scheduled time using spectrofluorimetric assay. Plasma concentration-time profiles were comodeled using compartmental method. Meanwhile, microsomal CYP isoenzymatic levels and P-gp expression in small intestines were compared between normal and hepatic fibrosis rats. When ofloxacin was administered intravenously, C(max) and the distribution half-life increased significantly in comparison with normal group, whereas the distribution rate constants, the apparent volume of distribution decreased. Oral ofloxacin bioavailability was significantly altered in hepatic fibrosis rats. AUC and C(max) were reduced, while the absorption half-life, peak time and elimination half-life significantly were prolonged, suggesting that both the extent and the rate of ofloxacin absorption were decreased. Furthermore, the increases in the levels of microsomal ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and erythromycin N-demethylase were accompanied with up-regulation of mdr 1a mRNA in the small intestines of hepatic fibrosis rats when compared to those of the normal rats. The Results showed that pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin could be altered in hepatic fibrosis. Up-regulated P-gp expression and increased CYP isoenzymatic activities of small intestines in hepatic fibrosis rats may contribute to the decreased bioavailability and increased elimination of ofloxacin after oral administration.
We describe five patients with complications following amphetamine overdose. Two of the patients died: one with disseminated intravascular coagulation and circulatory collapse, one with severe rhabdomyolysis and ischemic colitis. Among the other three cases, one developed acute psychosis, hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis, one developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and one pericarditis. The effects of amphetamine are discussed along with the diagnosis and treatment of patients with such poisoning.
Although the chance of cure for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is high, their outlook with subsequent relapse is poor. Bone marrow transplantation may be an option for some, but the need for intensive reinduction chemotherapy regimens remains the best hope for effecting cure in the majority of relapsed children. The authors report the experience of using an intensive chemotherapy protocol (Memorial Sloan-Kettering-New York II Protocol, MSK-NY-II) in a series of relapsed children with ALL. Thirty children presenting to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney, in their first relapse of ALL were treated according to a modification of the original MSK-NY-II protocol. Three children (10%) died during induction therapy, two from overwhelming Gram-negative sepsis, and one from intracerebral haemorrhage. Of 27 children completing induction, two children failed to enter remission; however, both had planned deviations from the protocol. Infectious complications were prominent with a total of 55 admissions for febrile neutropenic episodes. Eight children required the support of the intensive care unit for infectious complications. A total of 36 microbiological isolates were obtained from the patients during induction therapy. Ten bone marrow transplant procedures have been subsequently performed in these children, of whom five are alive and disease free at the time of writing. The MSK-NY-II protocol is an intensive regimen but with encouraging early remission rates in relapsed childhood ALL. Early sepsis in previously immunosuppressed children is an important cause of induction death.
Misoprostol has been associated with adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal symptoms, gynecologic problems, and headache. Changes in mental status, however, have not been reported. We present a case in which an 89-year-old woman in a long-term care facility became confused after the initiation of misoprostol therapy. The patient's change in mental status was first reported nine days after the initiation of therapy. Her delirium significantly improved after misoprostol was discontinued and her mental status returned to normal within a week. Because no other factors related to this patient changed significantly, the delirium experienced by this patient possibly resulted from misoprostol therapy.
Mild-to-moderate AD patients were randomized to placebo or rosiglitazone (RSG) 2, 4 or 8 mg. Primary end points at Week 24 were mean change from baseline in AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) and Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input global scores in the intention-to-treat population (N=511), and results were also stratified by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (n=323). No statistically significant differences on primary end points were detected between placebo and any RSG dose. There was a significant interaction between APOE epsilon4 allele status and ADAS-Cog (P=0.014). Exploratory analyses demonstrated significant improvement in ADAS-Cog in APOE epsilon4-negative patients on 8 mg RSG (P=0.024; not corrected for multiplicity). APOE epsilon4-positive patients did not show improvement and showed a decline at the lowest RSG dose (P=0.012; not corrected for multiplicity). Exploratory analyses suggested that APOE epsilon4 non-carriers exhibited cognitive and functional improvement in response to RSG, whereas APOE epsilon4 allele carriers showed no improvement and some decline was noted. These preliminary findings require confirmation in appropriate clinical studies.
The spinal cord is a target of progesterone (PROG), as demonstrated by the expression of intracellular and membrane PROG receptors and by its myelinating and neuroprotective effects in trauma and neurodegeneration. Here we studied PROG effects in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis characterized by demyelination and immune cell infiltration in the spinal cord. Female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG(40-54)). One week before EAE induction, mice received single pellets of PROG weighing either 20 or 100 mg or remained free of steroid treatment. On average, mice developed clinical signs of EAE 9-10 days following MOG administration. The spinal cord white matter of EAE mice showed inflammatory cell infiltration and circumscribed demyelinating areas, demonstrated by reductions of luxol fast blue (LFB) staining, myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) immunoreactivity (IR) and PLP mRNA expression. In motoneurons, EAE reduced the expression of the alpha 3 subunit of Na,K-ATPase mRNA. In contrast, EAE mice receiving PROG showed less inflammatory cell infiltration, recovery of myelin proteins and normal grain density of neuronal Na,K-ATPase mRNA. Clinically, PROG produced a moderate delay of disease onset and reduced the clinical scores. Thus, PROG attenuated disease severity, and reduced the inflammatory response and the occurrence of demyelination in the spinal cord during the acute phase of EAE.
Malachite green is a commercially available dye used to treat parasitic and fungal disease in fish. No previous reports of human injury could be located from acute ingestion of malachite green. We report a case of methemoglobinemia of 51% in a 3 year old girl after acute ingestion of malachite green from a commercially available aquarium product.
Disulfiram may cause a peripheral neuropathy that is considered dose- and duration-of-exposure-related. Axonal degeneration has been described as a pathological hallmark of disulfiram toxicity, but experiments have reported a primary toxic effect of the molecule on Schwann cells and myelin.
Case 1: At the end of two months of treatment with disulfiram 250 mg/day, a 31-year-old woman complained of weakness in distal segments of the lower limbs associated with burning dysesthesias, numbness and pain in the soles of the feet and the legs below the knees; bilateral walking steppage, reduction in foot strength, absence of ankle jerk and knee tendon reflexes, and tactile stocking pin-pick and vibratory sensory impairment in the lower limbs below the knee. Disulfiram was discontinued and she recovered partially over three months. Case 2: After one month of treatment with disulfiram 1600 mg/day, a 27-year-old man reported walking impairment, distal lower limb weakness and paresthesias. He had unsteady gait with bilateral steppage and foot drop, absence of ankle jerks and overall sensation impairment below the knee. Disulfiram was discontinued and nine months later there was almost complete recovery of motor deficits, only minor motor weakness in distal leg muscles, and no dysesthesia, sensation deficits or areflexia. In both of them clinical and neurophysiological patterns were indicative of a distal axonopathy. DISCUSSION The mechanisms by which disulfiram cause injury in human nerves are unclear, though may involve carbon disulfide. The discrepancy between experimental and clinical observations is still unexplained.
We report two cases of disulfiram axonal toxicity and the partial response following discontinuation of the drug.
Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels were measured in patients who came to an emergency department complaining of acute chest pain. For subjects not receiving prior oxygen therapy, those with cocaine-related chest pain (n = 10) had a higher mean COHb level than a comparison group (n = 28) with nonischemic chest pain (4.50 +/- 2.40 vs 2.73 +/- 0.66; p < 0.05). Four of the seven (57 percent) who smoked crack had COHb levels greater than 4.5 percent, while only one of six (17 percent) smokers of only tobacco had such a level. These findings suggest an additional mechanism, the formation of COHb, which could aggravate cocaine-induced cardiotoxicity.
Rats were exposed to phosgene at a concentration of 1.0 ppm for 4 hours in a Rochester-type chamber. At intervals thereafter over a 4 day period, lungs were obtained for histological and biochemical assessments. Edema was estimated by histological examination and by measurement of lung wet and dry weights. In parallel studies, pulmonary mitochondrial respiratory activity was measured using Clark oxygen electrodes. The significant reduction in respiratory control index (State 3 respiration/State 4 respiration) found immediately following phosgene exposure coincided with the highest level of % lung water. There was a concomitant decrease of ATP concentration that persisted on the third day after exposure. Na-K-ATPase activity was reduced 1 day after exposure, thus a lowered ATP level preceded a reduction in Na-K-ATPase or sodium pump activity. The reduction in ATP level and Na-K-ATPase activity may play a major role in damage to lung tissue following exposure to phosgene.
17,187 patients entering 417 hospitals up to 24 hours (median 5 hours) after the onset of suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomised, with placebo control, between: (i) a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 1.5 MU of streptokinase; (ii) one month of 160 mg/day enteric-coated aspirin; (iii) both active treatments; or (iv) neither. Streptokinase alone and aspirin alone each produced a highly significant reduction in 5-week vascular mortality: 791/8592 (9.2%) among patients allocated streptokinase infusion vs 1029/8595 (12.0%) among those allocated placebo infusion (odds reduction: 25% SD 4; 2p less than 0.00001); 804/8587 (9.4%) vascular deaths among patients allocated aspirin tablets vs 1016/8600 (11.8%) among those allocated placebo tablets (odds reduction: 23% SD 4; 2p less than 0.00001). The combination of streptokinase and aspirin was significantly (2p less than 0.0001) better than either agent alone. Their separate effects on vascular deaths appeared to be additive: 343/4292 (8.0%) among patients allocated both active agents vs 568/4300 (13.2%) among those allocated neither (odds reduction: 42% SD 5; 95% confidence limits 34-50%). There was evidence of benefit from each agent even for patients treated late after pain onset (odds reductions at 0-4, 5-12, and 13-24 hours: 35% SD 6, 16% SD 7, and 21% SD 12 for streptokinase alone; 25% SD 7, 21% SD 7, and 21% SD 12 for aspirin alone; and 53% SD 8, 32% SD 9, and 38% SD 15 for the combination of streptokinase and aspirin). Streptokinase was associated with an excess of bleeds requiring transfusion (0.5% vs 0.2%) and of confirmed cerebral haemorrhage (0.1% vs 0.0%), but with fewer other strokes (0.6% vs 0.8%). These "other" strokes may have included a few undiagnosed cerebral haemorrhages, but still there was no increase in total strokes (0.7% streptokinase vs 0.8% placebo infusion). Aspirin significantly reduced non-fatal reinfarction (1.0% vs 2.0%) and non-fatal stroke (0.3% vs 0.6%), and was not associated with any significant increase in cerebral haemorrhage or in bleeds requiring transfusion. An excess of non-fatal reinfarction was reported when streptokinase was used alone, but this appeared to be entirely avoided by the addition of aspirin. Those allocated the combination of streptokinase and aspirin had significantly fewer reinfarctions (1.8% vs 2.9%), strokes (0.6% vs 1.1%), and deaths (8.0% vs 13.2%) than those allocated neither. The differences in vascular and in all-cause mortality produced by streptokinase and by aspirin remain highly significant (2p less than 0.001 for each) after the median of 15 months of follow-up thus far available.
We have previously shown that a single i.p. injection of nitrosomethylurea (NMU) in 3-day-old rats orally treated with the pesticide mancozeb (MZ), the flavonoid quercetin (Q) or in combination (MZ-Q) induces hyperplasia, atypical acinar cell proliferation and carcinoma in situ (CIS) in the pancreas. This work studies the effect of oral administration of phenobarbital (PB) on this model of pancreatic carcinogenesis. The animals were fed on a diet supplemented by MZ or/and Q from the 10th day of pregnancy, thorough lactation and as pups after weaning until being sacrificed at week 24. Saline injection with non-supplemented diet was used for the control group (SAL). The experimental groups were (1) SAL (control), (2) SAL-PB, (3) NMU, (4) NMU-PB, (5) MZ-NMU, (6) MZ-NMU-PB, (7) Q-NMU, (8) Q-NMU-PB, (9) MZ-Q-NMU and (10) MZ-Q-NMU-PB. Acinar cell hyperplasia was found in all groups of NMU-treated rats. Dysplastic foci (DYS) were seen in groups 3-10 at the following percentages: 19, 48, 71, 27, 71, 35, 100 and 30, respectively. CIS were recorded in groups 4 to 10 at percentages: 4, 36, 13, 11, 0, 16, 5, respectively.
Although PB, Q or MZ given alone enhance DYS lesions in NMU-treated rats, the MZ/Q/PB combined treatments may increase (mainly in males) or decrease (mainly in female) the DYS and CIS proportion. Because PB, MZ and Q influence P450 enzymes, we suggest that these enzymes play a role in the carcinogenesis process.
The biliary bile acid composition was determined for patients with cystic fibrosis and associated liver disease before and after the administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (10 to 15 mg/kg body wt/day). Bile acids were analyzed by fast atom bombardment ionization-mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after individual bile acids were separated according to their mode of conjugation using the lipophilic anion exchanger, diethylaminohydroxypropyl Sephadex LH-20. More than 50 individual bile acids were identified in the bile of cystic fibrosis patients and these acids were predominantly secreted as glycine and taurine conjugates. Small proportions (less than 8% of the total) of unconjugated and sulfate conjugates were present. Of interest was the identification of two side-chain-elongated (C25) bile acids, homocholic and homochenodeoxycholic acids. After ursodeoxycholic acid was administered, duodenal bile became enriched with the conjugated species of ursodeoxycholic acid (accounting for 11.9% to 32.5% of the total biliary bile acids), but to a lesser extent than reported previously for patients with other liver diseases or gallstones who received comparable doses of ursodeoxycholic acid, and this presumably occurs because of bile acid malabsorption that is a feature of cystic fibrosis. The mean glycine/taurine ratio increased from 2.4 before ursodeoxycholic acid administration to 5 after ursodeoxycholic acid administration even though these patients also received taurine. Despite the relatively low enrichment of the bile by ursodeoxycholic acid, biochemical indices of liver function all improved in these patients after ursodeoxycholic acid administration.
We investigated the effects of propofol on markers of oxidative stress, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in liver of rats treated with halothane under hypoxic conditions. Male Wistar rats received halothane 1%/oxygen 14%, oxygen 14%/propofol 60 mg kg(-1) i.p., or halothane 1%/oxygen 14%/propofol 60 mg kg(-1) i.p. Morphological examination showed complete loss of architecture with massive necrosis of parenchyma in the halothane group, while only minor histological abnormalities were observed in rats receiving halothane plus propofol. The cytosolic concentration of TBARS and the hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence increased significantly in the liver of animals from the halothane group (+62% and +40% versus controls, respectively), and this increase was abolished by propofol administration. Halothane induced a marked activation of NF-kappaB (+180%), and resulted in a significant decrease of the nonphosphorylated form of the inhibitor IkappaBalpha (-53%), while phosphorylated IkappaBalpha protein level was markedly increased (+146%). Propofol administration lowered these effects to +30% (NF-kappaB), -26% (nonphosphorylated IkappaBalpha), and +56% (phosphorylated IkappaBalpha). The increase of iNOS protein level (+59%) induced by halothane was significantly reduced to +22% by additional administration of propofol. Results obtained show that administration of propofol inhibits oxidative stress, NF-kappaB nuclear traslocation and iNOS overexpression in liver of rats receiving halothane. Propofol treatment, by inhibiting the NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway, might block the production of noxious mediators involved in the development of halothane-induced injury.
Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is thought to be associated with immunosuppressive treatments, but insufficient information is available on the effect of corticosteroids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of HBV reactivation in hepatitis B surface antigen-seropositive patients with asthma or COPD, who were treated with systemic corticosteroids (SCS) in addition to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).
Patients with asthma or COPD (n = 198), who were hepatitis B surface antigen-seropositive and had been treated with ICS, were identified retrospectively. To evaluate the additional effects of SCS, the SCS group was divided into those who received intermittent or continuous SCS (≥3 months of continuous SCS treatment), and into those who received low-dose (≤20 mg/day of prednisolone) or medium-to-high-dose SCS. The study outcome was HBV reactivation.
HBV reactivation occurred in 11.1% of patients in the SCS group, which was significantly higher than the reactivation rate in the ICS group. HBV reactivation was more frequent in the SCS group compared with the ICS group (OR 3.813, 95% CI: 1.106-13.145, P = 0.032), and in the continuous and medium-to-high-dose SCS subgroups compared with the ICS group (OR 5.719, 95% CI: 1.172-27.905, P = 0.048 and OR 4.884, 95% CI: 1.362-17.511, P = 0.014, respectively).
These results suggest that addition of SCS to ICS increases the risk of HBV reactivation, especially when SCS are administered chronically or at high doses.
Among 50 patients with phenytoin intoxication, 14 had seizures during the episode. Seizures in 9 of these 14 patients probably resulted from poor seizure control despite high phenytoin levels, but in 5 cases, attacks were attributed to phenytoin toxicity. The only factor that seemed to correlate with seizures was a serum phenytoin level over 30 micrograms/ml. No demographic, metabolic, neuropsychiatric, or therapeutic variables were predictive; nor were any other symptoms of toxicity particularly likely to be found in association with seizures. Seizures are an occasional manifestation of phenytoin toxicity, particularly when levels are high.
This study demonstrates that combined treatment with subtoxic doses of quercetin (3',3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone), a flavonoid found in many fruits and vegetables, plus tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces rapid apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Effective induction of apoptosis by the combined treatment with quercetin and TRAIL was not blocked by overexpression of Bcl-xL, which is known to confer resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents. These results suggest that this combined treatment may provide an attractive strategy for treating resistant HCCs. While the proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 by TRAIL was partially blocked in various HCC cells treated with TRAIL alone, co-treatment with quercetin efficiently recovered TRAIL-induced caspase activation. We found that quercetin treatment of HCC cells significantly up-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of DR5, a death receptor of TRAIL, in a transcription factor Sp1-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with quercetin significantly decreased the protein levels of c-FLIP, an inhibitor of caspase-8, through proteasome-mediated degradation. Finally, administration of small interfering RNA against DR5 or overexpression of c-FLIPS, but not c-FLIPL, significantly attenuated quercetin-stimulated TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these findings show that quercetin recovers TRAIL sensitivity in various HCC cells via up-regulation of DR5 and down-regulation of c-FLIPS.
Oto-spondylo-megaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED) is a very rare disorder due to mutation of type XI collagen. Less than 30 patients have been reported in the literature so far. It could be either of autosomal dominant (OMIM 154780) or recessive (OMIM 215150) etiology. Two sibs with OSMED are presented. They had disproportionate short stature and short limbs, distinct face with midface hypoplasia, short nose, depressed nasal bridge, long philtrum, and non-progressive sensorineural deafness. Radiological findings showed short long bones and large epiphyses with metaphyseal flaring and mild platyspondyly and coronal clefting. Homozygosity of a single nucleotide deletion in exon 55 causing a premature stop codon in exon 56 of COL11A2 was detected in the affected sibs. Parents were heterozygotes for the same mutation and interestingly, the father had mild unilateral non-progressive sensorineural deafness. This finding adds more weight that the type of mutation and location in COL11A2 are crucial in determining the phenotype. The purpose of this study is to report clinical and radiological findings in two molecularly proven Egyptian sibs with autosomal recessive OSMED.
High-dose propofol infusion for sedation of patients in the intensive care unit can result in rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, ventricular arrhythmia, hyperthermia, and death. The death of a patient with such complications after lung biopsy is reported. Until a safer dosage range has been determined, propofol infusion at rates higher than 5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) should be discouraged for long-term sedation (> 48 h).
We describe 2 patients with systemic lupus erythematous whose widespread discoid lupus erythematosus was unresponsive to systemic steroids and antimalarial agents. They showed dramatic improvement to thalidomide at a dose of 300 mg/d, with maximum benefit achieved within 15 weeks of therapy. Dosages of 50 to 100 mg/d were effective in maintaining remission for 1 year. However, thalidomide-induced neuropathy was observed in both cases.
