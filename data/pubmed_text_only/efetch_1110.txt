It has recently been shown that extrahepatic cells can eliminate intracellular cholesterol by enzymatic conversion into 27-hydroxy-cholesterol and 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid. Using immunohistochemical methods, we studied the presence of the enzyme responsible for these conversions, sterol 27-hydroxylase, in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. All plaques examined were found to contain sterol 27-hydroxylase immuno-reactive cells. While some endothelial cells stained for sterol 27-hydroxylase, the majority of the immunoreactive cells co-localized with macrophages. Accumulation of sterol 27-hydroxylase-positive cells were often observed in macrophage-rich core regions of complicated lesions. High concentrations of 27-hydroxycholesterol were found in plaques, while the concentration in non-atherosclerotic human vessels was lower by two orders of magnitude. The rabbit, which is particularly sensitive to dietary cholesterol and easily develops fatty streaks, had low plasma levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol, 3 ng/ml compared to 150 ng/ml in humans. The concentration of 27-hydroxycholesterol in the atherosclerotic rabbit vessels was also lower compared to human atherosclerotic plaques. The results are consistent with our hypothesis that sterol 27-hydroxylase may be utilized by human macrophages as a defence towards a high cholesterol load. This mechanism may be less important in some other species.
Involvement of the kappa opioid receptor in regulation of the pilocarpine-induced seizures and neurodegeneration was studied in mice. Administration of pilocarpine (400 mg/kg i.p.) resulted in a sequence of behavioral alterations including motor limbic seizures. Pretreatment of mice with the selective kappa opioid receptor agonist U69,593 (2 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) or PD117,302 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg i.p.) increased the latency of motor seizures and decreased the seizure severity and mortality. Those effects were abolished in animals pretreated with the specific kappa opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (Nor-BNI, 10 mg/kg i.p.). Examination of frontal forebrain sections by light microscopy revealed widespread damage, especially within the hippocampal formation, in pilocarpine-treated mice. Both U69,593 and PD117,503 protected the integrity of hippocampal neurons, especially in the CA1 region, that effect being reversed by Nor-BNI. The above data indicate that activation of the kappa opioid receptor exerts an inhibitory effect on the pilocarpine-induced limbic seizures and neurotoxicity.
Loss-of-function mutations in the FLG (filaggrin) gene cause the semidominant keratinizing disorder ichthyosis vulgaris and convey major genetic risk for atopic dermatitis (eczema), eczema-associated asthma and other allergic phenotypes. Several low-frequency FLG null alleles occur in Europeans and Asians, with a cumulative frequency of approximately 9% in Europe. Here we report a 1-bp deletion mutation, 5303delA, analogous to common human FLG mutations, within the murine Flg gene in the spontaneous mouse mutant flaky tail (ft). We demonstrate that topical application of allergen to mice homozygous for this mutation results in cutaneous inflammatory infiltrates and enhanced cutaneous allergen priming with development of allergen-specific antibody responses. These data validate flaky tail as a useful model of filaggrin deficiency and provide experimental evidence for the hypothesis that antigen transfer through a defective epidermal barrier is a key mechanism underlying elevated IgE sensitization and initiation of cutaneous inflammation in humans with filaggrin-related atopic disease.
Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) are two enzymes that regulate homocysteine metabolism. Elevated homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and vascular disease. We assessed whether polymorphisms in MTRR (66A-->G; I22M) and BHMT (742G-->A; R239Q) were associated with abruption. We further evaluated whether homocysteine levels differed between cases and controls for MTRR and BHMT genotypes.
Data were derived from the New Jersey Placental Abruption Study (NJ-PAS)-an ongoing, multicenter, case-control study since August 2002. Women with a clinical diagnosis of abruption were recruited as incident cases (n=196), and controls (n=191) were matched to cases based on maternal race/ethnicity and parity. Total plasma homocysteine concentrations were evaluated in a subset of 136 cases and 136 controls. DNA was genotyped for the MTRR and BHMT polymorphisms.
Frequencies of the minor allele of MTRR were 40.8% and 42.2% in cases and controls, respectively (adjusted OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.45, 1.40). The corresponding rates for BHMT were 33.9% and 31.7%, respectively (adjusted OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.99, 4.09). Distributions for the homozygous mutant form of MTRR were similar between cases and controls (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.62, 2.24). The rate of homozygous mutant BHMT genotype was 2.8-fold (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.84, 4.97) higher in cases than controls. Stratification of analyses based on maternal race did not reveal any patterns in association.
In this population, there was an association between the homozygous mutant form of BHMT (742G-->A) polymorphism and increased risk for placental abruption.
There is a tendency for the incidence of diabetes in a population to increase with an improvement in living standards. This would imply the involvement of nutritional factors in the development of diabetes, and so nutritional considerations could be a key aspect in the research and development of an effective remedy for diabetes. In this study, combined micronutrients (selenium, vitamin E, vanadium, and chromium) were orally supplemented to streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Results showed that combined micronutrients could decrease the high blood glucose levels (p<0.05 or p<0.01) of diabetic mice. The protective effects of combined micronutrients on structures of beta-cells in pancreatic islets of diabetic mice were observed histopathologically and ultrastructurally. In addition, the supplementation of combined micronutrients increased insulin expression by beta-cells in pancreatic islets of diabetic mice at both translational and transcriptional levels. The immune molecular mechanisms involved were preliminarily regarded as downregulation of the expression of pathogenic T-helper 1 lymphocyte (Th1) cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (p<0.01) along with upregulation of the expression of protective T-helper 2 lymphocyte Th2 cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) (p<0.01) which ameliorates the Th1/Th2 imbalance in diabetes. In conclusion, supplementation of combined micronutrients to diabetic mice could effectively improve disordered glucose metabolism, protect islet structures, and improve the function of beta-cells in pancreatic islets, which are affected by differential regulation of the expression of Th1/Th2 cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes.
Spinal epidural lipomatosis associated with Cushing's syndrome is an uncommon complication (11 reported cases). Two additional symptomatic cases with neurologic deficit are described. Steroid treatment was systemic in the first case and local with epidural injections in the second. The second case is unique because no similar observations have yet been reported. In most cases, a preoperative computed tomographic scan establishes the diagnosis by demonstrating dural compression by an adipose mass. Myelography is far less specific. In some cases, the exact diagnosis is made at the time of surgery. The treatment is primarily surgical, with laminectomy over the length of the compression and the removal of the compressing fat. Neurologic recovery is dependent on two factors: the level of the compression and the adequacy of decompression.
We evaluated the effectiveness of the cocaine test for diagnosing Horner's syndrome. The test was administered to 119 patients with a diagnosis of Horner's syndrome and to 50 normal subjects. We compared the cocaine-induced anisocoria in the two groups by measuring photographs of the pupils. We found the cocaine test to be highly effective in separating normal subjects from patients with Horner's syndrome. The chances of having Horner's syndrome increased with the amount of cocaine-induced anisocoria. Through the use of logistic regression analysis, we determined the odds ratio of having Horner's syndrome compared with not having it for each 0.1-mm increment of anisocoria measured after cocaine administration. A postcocaine anisocoria value of 0.8 mm gave a mean odds ratio of approximately 1050:1 that Horner's syndrome was present (lower 95% confidence limit = 37:1). We found that simply measuring the postcocaine anisocoria provided a better prediction of Horner's syndrome than taking the trouble to calculate the net change in anisocoria. Odds ratios should help the clinician decide if the result of a cocaine test is indicative of Horner's syndrome.
Chronic hepatitis B is a serious infectious liver disease that often progresses to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, clinical outcomes after viral exposure vary enormously among individuals. Through a two-stage genome-wide association study using 786 Japanese chronic hepatitis B cases and 2,201 controls, we identified a significant association of chronic hepatitis B with 11 SNPs in a region including HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1. We validated these associations by genotyping two SNPs from the region in three additional Japanese and Thai cohorts consisting of 1,300 cases and 2,100 controls (combined P = 6.34 x 10(-39) and 2.31 x 10(-38), OR = 0.57 and 0.56, respectively). Subsequent analyses revealed risk haplotypes (HLA-DPA1(*)0202-DPB1(*)0501 and HLA-DPA1(*)0202-DPB1(*)0301, OR = 1.45 and 2.31, respectively) and protective haplotypes (HLA-DPA1(*)0103-DPB1(*)0402 and HLA-DPA1(*)0103-DPB1(*)0401, OR = 0.52 and 0.57, respectively). Our findings show that genetic variants in the HLA-DP locus are strongly associated with risk of persistent infection with hepatitis B virus.
Opioid receptor-binding autoradiography was used as a way to map sites of altered opioid transmission in a rat model of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathways sustained a 3-week treatment with l-DOPA (6 mg/kg/day, combined with 12 mg/kg/day benserazide), causing about half of them to develop dyskinetic-like movements on the side of the body contralateral to the lesion. Autoradiographic analysis of mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid binding sites was carried out in the caudate-putamen (CPu), the globus pallidus (GP), the substantia nigra (SN), the primary motor area, and the premotor-cingulate cortex. The dopamine-denervating lesion alone caused an ipsilateral reduction in opioid radioligand binding in the CPu, GP, and SN, but not in the cerebral cortex. Chronic l-DOPA treatment affected opioid receptor binding in both the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex, producing changes that were both structure- and receptor-type specific, and closely related to the motor response elicited by the treatment. In the basal ganglia, the most clear-cut differences between dyskinetic and nondyskinetic rats pertained to kappa opioid sites. On the lesioned side, both striatal and nigral levels of kappa binding densities were significantly lower in the dyskinetic group, showing a negative correlation with the rats' dyskinesia scores on one hand and with the striatal expression of opioid precursor mRNAs on the other hand. In the cerebral cortex, levels of mu and delta binding site densities were bilaterally elevated in the dyskinetic group, whereas kappa radioligand binding was specifically increased in the nondyskinetic cases and showed a negative correlation with the rats' dyskinesia scores. These data demonstrate that bilateral changes in cortical opioid transmission are closely associated with l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the rat. Moreover, the fact that dyskinetic and nondyskinetic animals often show opposite changes in opioid radioligand binding suggests that the motor response to l-DOPA is determined, at least in part, by compensatory adjustments of brain opioid receptors.
Garlic and garlic extracts are used as seasonings and are generally considered beneficial to human health, which include antioxidant and neuroprotective properties in neurological disorders. In the present study, we examined the effects of garlic sulfur components on the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and hippocampal neurogenesis. Of the sulfur compounds extracted, diallyl disulfide (DADS) significantly suppressed the proliferation of NPCs, whereas other sulfur containing components had no effect. In order to investigate the effect of DADS on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, DADS was administered orally to young (6 week-old) male C57BL/6 mice for 2 weeks. It was found that 10 mg/kg of DADS significantly decreased the proliferation of NPCs in the dentate gyrus without affecting the survival of newly generated cells. Furthermore, DADS decreased levels of hippocampal BDNF, phosphorylated CREB signaling, and phosphorylated ERKs, which are known to be related to hippocampal neurogenesis and NPCs proliferation. In addition, DADS induced significant memory defects as compared with controls. We report that DADS may have adverse effects on hippocampal neurogenesis and neurocognitive functions by modulating ERK and BDNF-CREB signaling, and suggest that the advisability of consuming large amounts of garlic products should be considered, particularly during the period of neural growth.
A patient with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy developed generalized fasciculations under verapamil which ceased after discontinuation of the drug. It is suggested that the increase in acetylcholine (ACh) release at the neuromuscular junction by verapamil may trigger fasciculation in the state of regeneration at ACh-sensitive sites of axon terminals and immature axon sprouts.
We review the efficacy, tolerability and safety of low-dose thalidomide in the treatment of refractory disfiguring rash in 16 patients with cutaneous manifestations of lupus. Rashes, which included discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE), photosensitive malar rash and non-specific chronic erythema, were diagnosed on clinical grounds, supported by skin biopsy in 11/16 patients. Using starting doses of 50-100 mg/day, 7/16 (44%) patients gained complete or near-complete remission of skin disease and 6/16 (37%) partial remission. Three out of 16 patients failed to respond. Maximum benefit was achieved within 16 weeks in all patients. Doses of 25-50 mg/day were effective in maintaining response. Rapid relapse occurred in 6/8 (75%) patients following drug withdrawal, but the response to thalidomide in those requiring repeat courses appeared to be maintained. There was no detectable improvement in systemic disease. One patient developed symptoms of mild peripheral neuropathy which resolved on drug withdrawal. Our experience suggests that thalidomide is effective in the treatment of severe skin manifestations of lupus refractory to other treatment and can be used safely in specialist rheumatological practice.
We have looked for disease-causing mutations in the PKD1 gene in 20 unrelated ADPKD probands from northern Italy, all members of families in which our previous studies had indicated linkage to PKD1. Using PCR with primer pairs located in the 3' unique region of the gene and heteroduplex DNA analysis, we have detected novel aberrant bands in five affected individuals from the same family, which were absent in 13 other unaffected family members. Cloning and automated DNA sequencing revealed a C to T transition at nucleotide position 3817 of the published cDNA sequence, which created a premature stop codon. The mutation destroyed a MspA1I restriction site, and the abnormal restriction pattern was observed on genomic DNA from all the affected family members. RT-PCR and restriction analysis performed on peripheral white blood cell mRNA showed that in the affected members, both the mutant and the normal transcript are represented. This mutation was not found in the probands of the other families studied. To our knowledge, this is the first nonsense mutation described in the PKD1 gene.
Activating mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene were recently discovered in neuroblastoma, a cancer of the developing autonomic nervous system that is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the first year of life. The most frequent ALK mutations in neuroblastoma cause amino acid substitutions (F1174L and R1275Q) in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the intact ALK receptor. Identification of ALK as an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a dual-specific inhibitor of the ALK and Met tyrosine kinases, will be useful in treating this malignancy. Here, we assessed the ability of crizotinib to inhibit proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts expressing mutated or wild-type ALK. Crizotinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines expressing either R1275Q-mutated ALK or amplified wild-type ALK. In contrast, cell lines harboring F1174L-mutated ALK were relatively resistant to crizotinib. Biochemical analyses revealed that this reduced susceptibility of F1174L-mutated ALK to crizotinib inhibition resulted from an increased adenosine triphosphate-binding affinity (as also seen in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Thus, this effect should be surmountable with higher doses of crizotinib and/or with higher-affinity inhibitors.
We compared the cytotoxicity of the bioreductive antitumor agents mitomycin C (MMC) and streptonigrin (SN) with or without the DT-diaphorase (DTD) inducer dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in four human glioblastoma cell lines with the conventional chemotherapeutic agent, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). We also examined four other types of cancer cells to compare with glioblastoma cells. Cytotoxicity was measured with the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and was represented by 50% inhibition concentration (IC50). Enzymatic activities of DTD, cytochrome b5 reductase and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in cells were measured spectrophotometrically. IC50 for BCNU was in a range of 28-300 microM in the glioblastoma cell lines. Glioblastoma cells were more sensitive to MMC or SN than to BCNU. Pretreatment with DMF significantly increased cytotoxicity of MMC and SN in glioblastoma cell lines and the NCI-H1299 lung cancer cell line, but had no effect on BCNU cytotoxicity. DMF significantly increased DTD and cytochrome b5 reductase activity, and decreased GST in three of four glioblastoma cell lines. Addition of the DTD inhibitor, dicumarol, significantly inhibited cytotoxicity of MMC and SN, and reversed the increased cytotoxicity seen when DMF was combined with either MMC or SN in all glioblastoma cell lines. Combining inducers of DTD and cytochrome b5 reductase with bioreductive agents may be a potential therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma.
The clinical utility of anthracycline anticancer agents, especially doxorubicin, is limited by a progressive toxic cardiomyopathy linked to mitochondrial damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that the post-doxorubicin mouse heart fails to upregulate the nuclear program for mitochondrial biogenesis and its associated intrinsic antiapoptosis proteins, leading to severe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, sarcomere destruction, apoptosis, necrosis, and excessive wall stress and fibrosis. Furthermore, we exploited recent evidence that mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated by the CO/heme oxygenase (CO/HO) system to ameliorate doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in mice. We found that the myocardial pathology was averted by periodic CO inhalation, which restored mitochondrial biogenesis and circumvented intrinsic apoptosis through caspase-3 and apoptosis-inducing factor. Moreover, CO simultaneously reversed doxorubicin-induced loss of DNA binding by GATA-4 and restored critical sarcomeric proteins. In isolated rat cardiac cells, HO-1 enzyme overexpression prevented doxorubicin-induced mtDNA depletion and apoptosis via activation of Akt1/PKB and guanylate cyclase, while HO-1 gene silencing exacerbated doxorubicin-induced mtDNA depletion and apoptosis. Thus doxorubicin disrupts cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis, which promotes intrinsic apoptosis, while CO/HO promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and opposes apoptosis, forestalling fibrosis and cardiomyopathy. These findings imply that the therapeutic index of anthracycline cancer chemotherapeutics can be improved by the protection of cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis.
A 79-year-old man developed a renal insufficiency while on thiazide. Extrarenal symptoms were absent. Screening for antibodies revealed high titre for anti-myeloperoxidase and anti-cardiolipin antibodies, but no other antibodies were present. After withdrawal of the drug the progression of renal insufficiency ceased. Four months later the both antibodies had disappeared. We conclude, that antibodies against granulocytes will become a valuable diagnostic tool in diagnosing drug-induced vasculitis.
Formoterol is approved as asthma rescue medication in many countries. The exact duration of the airway vs. systemic effects of formoterol compared with another rescue medication, salbutamol, has not been evaluated.
To assess the duration of airway bronchodilatory effects vs. systemic effects of inhaled formoterol and salbutamol in asthmatic patients.
Twenty-six patients with stable and reversible asthma were given single doses of formoterol dry-powder inhaler (OxisTurbuhaler) 2x9 microg (lower dose; LD) and 6x9 microg (higher dose; HD), salbutamol (VentolinDiskhaler) 3x400 microg (LD) and 9x400 microg (HD), and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Airway and systemic effects were assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), serum potassium, blood pressure, corrected QT-interval (QTc), and palpitation and tremor scores. Time with clinically relevant bronchodilation (FEV1 increase 12%) without clinically relevant markers of systemic effects (serum potassium suppression 0.2 mmol/L, QTc-prolongation 20 ms, or heart rate increase 8 beats per minute) was evaluated.
Bronchodilation was maintained for 24h with both formoterol doses and for 7-11h with salbutamol. Maximum bronchodilation and systemic effects were similar after formoterol and salbutamol, except for statistically significantly larger maximum heart rate and palpitation and tremor scores after salbutamol. Systemic responses were similarly brief for formoterol and salbutamol (7 h).
The airway effects of inhaled formoterol are of long duration, whereas the systemic effects are of a similarly short duration as salbutamol. Thus, the time with clinically relevant bronchodilation without systemic effects is substantially longer after formoterol than after salbutamol.
Prior research has reliably found high blood (hyperserotonemia) - but low brain - serotonin levels in autistic individuals. At early stages of development, high levels of serotonin in the blood may enter the brain of a developing fetus, causing a loss of serotonin terminals through negative feedback and thus disrupting subsequent serotonergic function. The current study extends earlier findings in a developmental hyperserotonemia (DHS) model of autism in Sprague-Dawley rats by treating 8 dams of developing rat pups with a serotonergic agonist, 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT; 1 mg/kg) during development (from gestational day 12 to post-natal day 20; PND 20). DHS pups exhibited post-injection seizures, which were non-existent in saline-treated pups (p<0.05). Behavioral results in infancy indicated that DHS pups spent less time with the dam during the active phase on PNDs 15-17 (p<0.05) and experienced decreased maternal bonding in a return to dam task on PND 17 (p<0.05). On subsequent tests, DHS animals exhibited greater gnawing reactions to a novel stimulus (p<0.05), less behavioral inhibition (p<0.05), and had fewer olfactory-based social interactions (p<0.05) and greater non-olfactory mounting (p<0.05). However, there were no changes in anxiogenic behavior using the elevated plus maze (p>0.05). Post mortem analyses revealed that DHS animals had a loss of oxytocin (OT)-containing cells in the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus (PVN; p<0.05) as well as an increase in calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP; p<0.05, one tailed) processes in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) on PND 198. These results may correspond to hypothalamic and amygdalar changes in the human condition and suggest that the hyperserotonemia model of autism may be a valid model which produces many of the social, behavioral, and peptide changes inherent to autism.
Blood pressure, forearm arterial haemodynamics and echocardiographic parameters were studied in patients with sustained essential hypertension before and after administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril for 1 year. Perindopril significantly reduced blood pressure and at the same time increased brachial artery blood flow, diameter and compliance. As part of the haemodynamic investigation, a 5-min period of wrist occlusion was performed. Blood flow velocity decreased significantly to the same extent with perindopril and with placebo, but the corresponding reductions in arterial diameter were smaller with perindopril than with placebo, indicating that the increase in diameter following perindopril could not be explained solely on the basis of a flow-dependent dilation. After 3 months, treatment was stopped for 4 weeks. Blood pressure and forearm arterial haemodynamics returned towards baseline values. However, cardiac mass, which was significantly decreased after perindopril administration, remained decreased 4 weeks after cessation of treatment. In seven responder patients, perindopril was continued as sole therapy for 8 months. Arterial compliance remained elevated and cardiac mass diminished. The study showed that the arterial changes caused by perindopril involved a drug-related relaxation of arterial smooth muscle and that there was a differential response in cardiac and arterial changes following long-term treatment.
A case of bilateral cleft lip and palate associated with increased fetal nuchal translucency detected at 14 weeks of gestation in a cocaine abusing pregnant woman is presented. There were no other associated structural or chromosomal abnormalities. We propose that systematic examination in both the sagittal and parasagittal plane of the fetal profile and recognition of the characteristic ultrasound appearance of a premaxillary protruding echogenic mass should make detection of this type of cleft relatively easy at the moment of the first trimester scan. First trimester diagnosis of cleft lip and palate can facilitate the parental decision-making process on continuing or terminating the pregnancy and should open the perspective of fetal surgery.
