Interstitial cystitis causes disabling bladder pain and is usually diagnosed in the absence of infection. We describe a patient with interstitial cystitis who had high urinary levels of polyomavirus that decreased dramatically after initiation of intravesical cidofovir treatment; the patient also showed substantial improvement in symptoms. Another patient had milder symptoms of cystitis and intermittent polyomavirus shedding. Polyomaviruses, particularly BK virus, may cause some cases of interstitial cystitis.
Genetic variation in the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3, mGluR3) has been associated with schizophrenia, but the mechanism by which it confers risk is unknown. Previously, we reported the existence of a splice variant, GRM3Delta4, which has an exon 4 deletion and encodes a truncated form of the receptor that is expressed in brain. The aim of the present study was to determine whether expression of this splice variant is altered in individuals with schizophrenia and is affected by a risk genotype. We measured GRM3 and GRM3Delta4 transcripts in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus of the CBDB/NIMH collection ( approximately 70 controls, approximately 30 schizophrenia patients) and in the DLPFC of the Stanley Array Collection. Expression data of GRM3 mRNA in the DLPFC were inconsistent: GRM3 was increased in schizophrenia patients in the CBDB/NIMH collection, but not in the Stanley Array Collection. GRM3 expression did not change in the frontal cortex of rats treated chronically with haloperidol or clozapine. An exon 3 SNP previously associated with schizophrenia (rs2228595) predicted increased expression of the GRM3Delta4 splice variant. Our results suggest that rs2228595, or a neighboring SNP in linkage disequilibrium with it, may contribute to risk for schizophrenia by modulating GRM3 splicing.
Central neurotoxicity is reported in 5 of 16 patients with recently diagnosed anaplastic gliomas, who received intra-arterial BCNU (200 mg/M2/course) and also 2 in a series of 26 patients with recurrent gliomas similarly treated. Neurotoxicity was usually delayed, commencing several weeks following the second or third course. CT scans during central neurotoxicity represented 1 or more of 3 patterns: no change; increased low density area(s); and/or ipsilateral gyral enhancement and punctate calcification in the middle cerebral artery territory. In one clinicopathological correlation, coagulative necrosis of the white matter was observed, identical histologically to those changes recognized as delayed vascular events following radiotherapy. Cautious exploration of the various clinical factors that may contribute to this toxicity seems appropriate, as exploration of the potential benefits of regional chemotherapeutic infusions is undertaken.
Didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) is a representative dialkyl-quaternary ammonium compound that is used as a disinfectant against several pathogens and is also used in commercial, industrial, and residential settings. We previously investigated toxicity on air way system following single instillation of DDAC to the lungs in mice, and found that DDAC causes pulmonary injury, which is associated with altered antioxidant antimicrobial responses; the inflammatory phase is accompanied or followed by fibrotic response. The present study was conducted to monitor transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling in pulmonary fibrosis induced by DDAC. Mice were intratracheally instilled with DDAC and sacrificed 1, 3, or 7 days after treatment to measure TGF-β signaling. In order to further evaluate TGF-β signaling, we treated isolated mouse lung fibroblasts with DDAC. Fibrotic foci were observed in the lungs on day 3, and were widely extended on day 7, with evidence of increased α-smooth muscle actin-positive mesenchymal cells and upregulation of Type I procollagen mRNA. Developing fibrotic foci were likely associated with increased expression of Tgf-β1 mRNA, in addition to decreased expression of Bone morphogenetic protein-7 mRNA. In fibrotic lung samples, the expression of phosphorylated SMAD2/3 was considerably higher than that of phosphorylated SMAD1/5. In isolated lung fibroblasts, the mRNA levels of Tgf-β1 were specifically increased by DDAC treatment, which prolonged phosphorylation of SMAD2/3. These effects were abolished by treatment with SD208 - a TGF-βRI kinase inhibitor. The results suggest that DDAC induces pulmonary fibrosis in association with TGF-β signaling.
Nephrotoxicity is one of the adverse side effects of cyclophosphamide (CP) chemotherapy. In a recent study, we have demonstrated that oxidative stress and glutathione depletion play important roles in CP-induced renal damage. The aim of the study was to verify whether glutamine, the precursor for glutathione synthesis, prevents CP-induced oxidative stress and renal damage using a rat model. Adult male rats were administered a single dose of 150 mg/ kg body weight of CP intraperitoneally. The glutamine-pretreated rats were administered 1 gm/kg body weight of glutamine orally 2 h before the administration of CP. Vehicle/glutamine-treated rats served as controls. All the rats were killed 16 h after the dose of CP/vehicle. The kidneys were removed and used for light microscopic and biochemical studies. The markers of oxidative stress including malondialdehyde content, protein carbonyl content, protein thiol, reduced glutathione and myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration, were measured in kidney homogenates. CP treatment-induced damage to kidney involved the glomeruli and the tubules. Pretreatment with glutamine reduced CP-induced glutathione depletion and increased myeloperoxidase activity. However, it did not prevent CP-induced lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation and renal damage. The results of the present study suggest that glutamine pretreatment does not prevent CP-induced lipid peroxidation and renal damage, although it prevents CP-induced glutathione depletion and neutrophil infiltration significantly. It is suggested that mechanisms other than oxidative stress may also be involved and/or oxidative stress may be consequence and not the cause of CP induced renal damage.
Treatment of F344 rats with diethylstilbestrol (DES) for 1-2 months induces a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. After 8 weeks of DES treatment, we have shown that the ratio of regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (RI/RII) increased in the tumors. Presently we report the variations in RI/RII ratio, pituitary weight, DNA content, serum PRL, nuclear estrogen receptor (E2R) and of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity from the time of DES pellet implantation until 8 weeks. Pituitary weight, DNA content and serum PRL rose significantly at 4 weeks with a maximum at 6-8 weeks, and significantly correlated with each other. E2R and ODC activity increased from week 1 onwards, with a maximum at 2 weeks and decreased at 8 weeks. Both variables showed a positive correlation but neither E2R nor ODC activity correlated with pituitary weight, DNA or serum PRL. Values for RI remained stable with time, but RII decreased progressively. The RI/RII ratio was maintained around unity between 1-4 weeks, increasing to 1.6-2 thereafter. This ratio positively correlated with pituitary weight and DNA. It is suggested that during tumor induction by estrogen in a sensitive strain of rats, growth signals with different time-courses become activated. Increases in pituitary weight and DNA content, indicators of mammotroph hypertrophy and hyperplasia, were preceded by early rises in E2R and ODC activity. Increases in the RI/RII ratio accompanied the adenomatous change, suggesting their role in cell transformation after 6 weeks of estrogen exposure.
Five cases of amiodarone-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) are presented. All patients had recurrent syncope or dizziness due to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia and in all cases the QT interval was prolonged. In two cases hypokalemia was present at the time the arrhythmia was first recorded, but in both cases polymorphous ventricular tachycardia persisted despite correction of the electrolyte imbalance. Standard treatment for polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (isoproterenol, ventricular pacing, or both) was successful in all patients, however, therapy had to be continued for 5 to 10 days, most probably because of the long elimination half-life of amiodarone.
Methotrexate (MTX) is a folate antagonist widely used both as an anticancer drug and as an immunosupressant. Administration of an 8-day methotrexate and folinic acid regime may be associated with pleuritic chest pain and pneumonitis. We have reviewed the toxicity seen in 168 consecutive patients treated with low-dose MTX for persistent trophoblastic disease. Twenty-five per cent of patients developed serosal symptoms, pleurisy was the commonest complaint. The majority of patients had mild to moderate symptoms which were controlled with simple analgesia and did not necessitate a change in treatment; 11.9% had severe symptoms which necessitated a change in treatment. One patient developed a pericardial effusion and a second patient developed severe reversible peritoneal irritation. The possible aetiology and pathophysiology of methotrexate-induced serosal toxicity is discussed.
Ibuprofen-incurred nephrotoxicity in renal insufficiency was assessed by examining renal functional and pathological changes in rabbits with pre-existing renal failure after receiving consecutive doses of ibuprofen. The pharmacokinetic behavior of ibuprofen enantiomers in rabbits with renal dysfunction appeared to qualitatively parallel that of their human counterparts. Modifications of the pharmacokinetic profile occurred in a stereoselective fashion: (R)-ibuprofen disposition was independent of renal conditions, whereas (S)-ibuprofen clearance was significantly hampered. Pathological damage associated with ibuprofen use in renal dysfunction was evident from the renal necropsy specimens, which was characterized by tubular necrosis and interstitial nephritis. This animal model study indicates clearly that renal insufficiency is a causative factor for ibuprofen-induced interstitial nephritis. Moreover, based on the evidence of interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, this nephrotoxic syndrome is assumed to be a manifestation of a disordered cellular immunity.
To determine risk factors for methotrexate (MTX)-induced hepatic and hematologic laboratory abnormalities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Measurements of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), white blood cell counts, and platelet counts were collected in a database of patients with RA receiving MTX from 1991 through 2002. Potential risk factors for toxicity were recorded on each patient.
Four hundred and eighty-one patients were followed for 2,323 person-years of MTX exposure. MTX was discontinued permanently because of abnormal laboratory test results in 22 patients (4.6%), the majority of whom (17/22, 77%) had elevated AST values. The body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in those patients where MTX was permanently discontinued than in those in whom it was not (p < 0.03). Independent predictors of a significantly higher percentage of abnormal AST values were lack of folate supplementation (p < 0.001) and untreated hyperlipidemia (p < 0.02). Of the 17 patients in whom MTX was discontinued permanently because of an elevated AST value, 11/17 (65%) had either lack of folate supplementation or untreated hyperlipidemia. Hypoalbuminemia correlated independently with an increased percentage of abnormal platelet counts (p < 0.03).
Lack of folate supplementation, untreated hyperlipidemia, and elevated BMI identified patients receiving MTX at risk for transaminase elevation, and low serum albumin was a risk factor for thrombocytopenia. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease could be the underlying risk factor for transaminase elevation in patients with hyperlipidemia and obesity.
We describe a sero-negative ocular myasthenic patient who showed exaggerated responses to both vecuronium and neostigmine. These hypersensitive responses were not anticipated because preoperative clinical and laboratory evaluations suggested a negligible impairment of somatic muscles by myasthenic processes. This case report re-emphasizes that, if neuromuscular blocking agents and their antagonists are administered to myasthenic patients, regardless of the degree of impairment, the dose should be titrated carefully with the aid of a neuromuscular transmission monitor.
Hereditary atransferrinemia is a rare but instructive disorder that has previously been reported in only 8 patients in 6 families. It is characterized by microcytic anemia and by iron loading, and can be treated effectively by plasma infusions. We now report the first case known in the United States. We determined the sequences flanking the exons of the human transferrin gene and sequenced all of the exons and some of the flanking regions of the patient's DNA and that of her parents. The patient's DNA revealed a 10-base pair (bp) deletion, followed by a 9-bp insertion of a duplicated sequence. There was also a G-->C transversion at complementary DNA (cDNA) nt 1429, predicting that a proline was substituted for the alanine in amino acid position 477 (Ala 477 Pro). The latter mutation occurs at an evolutionarily highly conserved site; 704 control alleles were screened and this point mutation was not found. Each of the patient's transferrin genes contains one mutation, ie, the patient is a compound heterozygote for these mutations, because one was found in each of her parents. In addition to these mutations, which we regard to be causative in the patient's atransferrinemia, a silent polymorphism at cDNA 1572 G-->C was found in exon 13 as well as 2 previously unreported polymorphisms at IVS8 + 62 c-->t and IVS14-4 c-->a. The mutation in nt 1572 and that in intron 8 were common in the general population; the intron 14 mutation is rare.
SRY-box containing gene 17 (Sox17) is a member of the high mobility group (HMG) transcription factor superfamily, which plays critical roles in the regulation of development and stem/precursor cell function, at least partly through repression of Wnt pathway activity. Modulators controlling aberrant Wnt signaling activation are frequently disrupted in human cancers through complementary effects of epigenetic and genetic changes. Our recent global analysis of CpG island hypermethylation and gene expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines revealed that SOX17 gene silencing is associated with DNA hypermethylation of a CpG island in the promoter region. Here, we report that CpG island methylation-dependent silencing of SOX17 occurs in 100% of CRC cell lines, 86% of colorectal adenomas, 100% of stage I and II CRC, 89% of stage III CRC, 89% of primary esophageal cancer, and 50% of non-small cell lung cancer. Overexpression of SOX17 in HCT116 CRC cells inhibits colony growth and beta-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent transcription. Structure-based deletion analysis further shows the presence of a Wnt signaling repression domain in the SOX17 HMG box. Together, our studies suggest that SOX17 is a negative modulator of canonical Wnt signaling, and that SOX17 silencing due to promoter hypermethylation is an early event during tumorigenesis and may contribute to aberrant activation of Wnt signaling in CRC.
Treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis remains limited to a few available options. Recent studies showed in vitro antileishmanial activity of (-) mammea A/BB, a coumarin isolated from leaves of Calophyllum brasiliense. Moreover, the dichloromethane crude extract and hexane fraction from this plant demonstrated in vivo activity in mice infected with Leishmania amazonensis. We evaluated the antileishmanial activity of (-) mammea A/BB in the L. amazonensis BALB/c mice model. The animals were given intramuscular and topical treatment with (-) mammea A/BB for 30 consecutive days. The results demonstrated that 18mg/kg/d intramuscularly or 0.2% topically of (-) mammea A/BB significantly reduced the size of skin lesions in footpads of mice compared with those in the control group (p<0.05). The activity of Glucantime(®) (corresponding to 27mg/kg/d of pentavalent antimony) administered intramuscularly was similar to that of (-) mammea A/BB (p<0.05) by both routes of administration. The histopathological evaluation showed no changes in the organs analyzed. These results indicate that the coumarin obtained from C. brasiliense is the antileishmanially active compound and can be used to control the development of cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions caused by L. amazonensis.
Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene leads to Sotos syndrome (Sos), which is characterised by excessive growth, especially during childhood, distinct craniofacial features and variable degree of mental impairment. A wide spectrum of NSD1 mutations have been described in Sos patients, ranging from more than 100 different single nucleotide changes, to partial gene deletions, and to microdeletions of various sizes comprising the entire NSD1 locus.
To investigate the NSD1 cDNA sequence in genetically confirmed Sos patients harbouring truncating and missense mutations.
Total RNA was isolated from a 250 mul standard EDTA blood sample from nine genetically verified Sos patients, and subsequent reverse-transcribed into cDNA followed by PCR and direct sequencing of specific NSD1 cDNA sequences.
All nine mutations, including missense, nonsense and whole exon deletions, previously identified in genomic DNA, could confidently be detected in cDNA. Several NSD1 transcript splice variants were detected.
Despite the fact that Sos is caused by haploinsufficiency, NSD1 transcripts containing nonsense and frame shift mutations can be detected in leukocyte-derived cDNA. The possibility therefore exists that certain NSD1 mutations are expressed and contribute to the phenotypic variability of Sos. NSD1 cDNA analysis is likely to enhance mutation detection in Sos patients.
It is well known that reduced blood flow in the scalp is a cause of alopecia. We have shown previously that the extract of Illicium anisatum increases subcutaneous blood flow in mice. In the present study, we used an organ culture system to examine whether this extract promoted hair follicle elongation. B6C3HF1 mouse vibrissae follicles were cultured in serum-free medium for 7 days at 31 degrees C. Follicles treated with water-soluble (WS) extracts of the leaves, fruits and roots of Illicium anisatum or shikimic acid grew significantly longer than controls. In contrast, ethyl acetate-soluble (AS) extracts and n-hexane-soluble (HS) extracts of the leaves, fruits and roots of the plant inhibited hair follicles and shaft growth. Fractionation of the WS fruit extract showed that the number 1 and number 2 fractions possessed hair follicle elongation activity. GC/MS analysis revealed that the number 1 fraction contained shikimic acid, and that the number 2 fraction was a mixture of many components including glycosides and polysaccharides. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that shikimic acid also induced mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-1, keratinocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor in the hair follicles. These results suggest that the WS extract of Illicium anisatum promotes hair growth and may be a useful additive in hair growth products.
A generalized cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction to a porcine heparin preparation was observed in a patient during the course of acute renal failure. Immunological studies, including gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis, suggested that the reaction was to a contaminant of the heparin and involved both IgG and IgE antibodies.
The predictive role of the quantification of thymidylate synthase (TS) in tumors treated with antifolate drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), has been extensively reported in a variety of human tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) represent potential targets of antifolate agents, but no data on TS expression level in these tumors are currently available.
A series of 116 NETs were collected, including 58 gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) and 58 lung NETs. In 24 well-differentiated GEP neuroendocrine carcinomas (WD-NEC), a 5-FU-based treatment was given. Total RNA was extracted from microdissected paraffin blocks. TS mRNA quantification was done by real-time PCR, whereas protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
By means of both quantification by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, a higher TS expression in pulmonary small cell lung cancer and large cell NEC compared with typical and atypical carcinoids was observed (P < 0.01). Similarly, in GEP tumors, a higher TS expression in poorly differentiated carcinomas than both WD-NEC and benign tumors (P < 0.01) was found. In patients with WD-NEC treated with 5-FU, high TS mRNA levels were associated with shorter time to progression (P = 0.002) and overall survival (P = 0.04). This negative prognostic role was confirmed in multivariate analysis adjusting for major prognostic variables (P = 0.01). No association between TS mRNA and survival was observed in WD-NEC patients not receiving 5-FU.
This study, for the first time, (a) reports the differential TS expression in the spectrum of NETs and (b) indicates TS as a possible predictive marker of treatment efficacy in WD-NEC patients treated with 5-FU.
Human immunodeficiency virus-1 antiretroviral treatment is associated with an increased incidence of atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that antiretrovirals directly impair endothelial function after short-term exposure and that with chronic exposure, this dysfunction promotes a proliferative response, inducing neointimal hyperplasia, thus contributing to vascular lesion formation. To test this hypothesis, we treated mice with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT), the protease inhibitor indinavir, or AZT + indinavir. Treatment with AZT or AZT + indinavir for 5 days impaired endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation. Though indinavir treatment alone did not alter vessel relaxation, it potentiated the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by AZT. Coadministration of the antioxidant Mn (III) tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin attenuated antiretroviral-induced endothelial dysfunction, suggesting that oxidant production may have a causal role in the observed endothelial dysfunction. To test whether the antiretrovirals promote a proliferative response following endothelial dysfunction, we treated mice with antiretrovirals for 14 days and then induced a carotid endothelial injury. Two weeks later, we observed a dramatic increase in neointimal formation in all antiretroviral-treated animals, and the newly formed neointima was comprised mainly of proliferated smooth muscle cells. Although a functional endothelium surrounding the lesioned area and re-endothelialization across the area of injury is important in reducing proliferation in this model, we tested whether the neointimal hyperplasia was associated with endothelial dysfunction. Plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine, a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, increased after treatment with indinavir or AZT + indinavir. On the other hand, treatment with AZT or AZT + indinavir increased endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule staining. We conclude that short-term treatment with antiretrovirals elicited a direct impairment in endothelial function, in part via an oxidant-dependent pathway. These antiretrovirals also exacerbated injury-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia, likely because of their inhibition of endothelial function.
The antiproliferative activity of the chemotherapeutic agent taxol was evaluated on 2 normal and 2 carcinoma human breast-cell lines and compared with its effects on newborn rat cardiac cells growing in vitro. Relatively little difference in ID50 response (ranging from 0.6 to 2.0 ng/ml) to taxol was found between normal and tumorous breast epithelial cells. Arrhythmias and slowing of beat frequencies of cardiac cells were induced by taxol but at doses approximately 10 times higher than those necessary to inhibit proliferation in dividing cells. Microtubules assayed by immunostaining appeared to be similarly retracted around the nucleus in both breast and heart cells. Overall, our results suggest that taxol does not selectively inhibit the growth of tumor vs. normal human breast cells. They also support the hypothesis that effects on microtubule integrity are associated with effects on cardiac function and that the clinical cardiac activity of taxol already reported may be due, at least in part, to a direct effect of taxol on cardiac cells as demonstrated in these in vitro studies. Thus, caution is needed, in view of possible cardiac effects, when using taxol in future clinical protocols, especially when combined with other cardioactive agents such as Adriamycin.
Psoriasis is a common immune-mediated disorder that affects the skin, nails and joints. To identify psoriasis susceptibility loci, we genotyped 438,670 SNPs in 1,409 psoriasis cases and 1,436 controls of European ancestry. We followed up 21 promising SNPs in 5,048 psoriasis cases and 5,041 controls. Our results provide strong support for the association of at least seven genetic loci and psoriasis (each with combined P < 5 x 10(-8)). Loci with confirmed association include HLA-C, three genes involved in IL-23 signaling (IL23A, IL23R, IL12B), two genes that act downstream of TNF-alpha and regulate NF-kappaB signaling (TNIP1, TNFAIP3) and two genes involved in the modulation of Th2 immune responses (IL4, IL13). Although the proteins encoded in these loci are known to interact biologically, we found no evidence for epistasis between associated SNPs. Our results expand the catalog of genetic loci implicated in psoriasis susceptibility and suggest priority targets for study in other auto-immune disorders.
Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease with a prevalence of 2-3% in individuals of European ancestry. In a genome-wide search for copy number variants (CNV) using a sample pooling approach, we have identified a deletion comprising LCE3B and LCE3C, members of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster. The absence of LCE3B and LCE3C (LCE3C_LCE3B-del) is significantly associated (P = 1.38E-08) with risk of psoriasis in 2,831 samples from Spain, The Netherlands, Italy and the United States, and in a family-based study (P = 5.4E-04). LCE3C_LCE3B-del is tagged by rs4112788 (r(2) = 0.93), which is also strongly associated with psoriasis (P < 6.6E-09). LCE3C_LCE3B-del shows epistatic effects with the HLA-Cw6 allele on the development of psoriasis in Dutch samples and multiplicative effects in the other samples. LCE expression can be induced in normal epidermis by skin barrier disruption and is strongly expressed in psoriatic lesions, suggesting that compromised skin barrier function has a role in psoriasis susceptibility.
Almotriptan is a new 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist effective for treating acute migraine attacks with or without aura. As 3-5% of patients treated with sumatriptan experience chest symptoms thought to be of cardiac origin, we investigated the cardiovascular safety profile of almotriptan in comparison with that of sumatriptan in six animal models. Almotriptan did not modify blood pressure or heart rate in conscious telemetered normotensive Wistar rats (p.o.), in anaesthetised beagle dogs (i.v.), or in conscious beagle dogs (i.v.), and only produced transient increases when administered (s.c.) to telemetered cynomolgus monkeys. Almotriptan did not consistently affect the duration of the electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals in anaesthetised beagle dogs even when the drug was administered into the coronary artery, nor was ECG morphology altered in telemetered cynomolgus monkeys. In contrast, sumatriptan i.v. consistently increased mean blood pressure and heart rate in conscious beagle dogs. Finally, almotriptan did not modify coronary blood flow at a dose of up to 0.3 mg/kg i.v. in conscious beagle dogs. Thus, almotriptan has a favourable cardiovascular safety profile.
We report the first large genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Chinese population to identify susceptibility variants for psoriasis using a two-stage case-control design. In the first stage, we carried out a genome-wide association analysis in 1,139 cases and 1,132 controls of Chinese Han ancestry using Illumina Human 610-Quad BeadChips. In the second stage, we took top SNPs forward for replication in two independent samples of 5,182 cases and 6,516 controls of Chinese Han ancestry, and 539 cases and 824 controls of Chinese Uygur ancestry. In addition to the strong replication for two known susceptibility loci MHC (rs1265181, P = 1.93 x 10(-208), OR = 22.62) and IL12B (rs3213094, P(combined) = 2.58 x 10(-26), OR = 0.78), we identified a new susceptibility locus within the LCE gene cluster on 1q21 (rs4085613, P(combined) = 6.69 x 10(-30), OR = 0.76).
