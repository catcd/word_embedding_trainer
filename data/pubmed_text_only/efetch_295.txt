Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is an inherited disorder of lymphocyte apoptosis leading to childhood onset of marked lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, autoimmune cytopenias, and increased risk of lymphoma. Most cases are associated with heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding Fas protein. Prolonged use of immunosuppressive drugs that do ameliorate its autoimmune complications fail to consistently lessen lymphoproliferation in ALPS. A case series had described children with ALPS, whose spleens (SPL) and lymph nodes decreased in size when treated weekly with pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine; parallel in vitro studies showed only pyrimethamine to promote apoptosis. On the basis of that experience, we undertook additional in vitro lymphocyte apoptosis assays, and measured SPL weights, lymphocyte numbers, and immunophenotypes in Fas-deficient MRL/lpr-/- mice to gain further insights into the utility of combined pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine or pyrimethamine alone. Moreover, seven children with ALPS enrolled in a study of escalating dose of pyrimethamine alone given twice weekly for 12 weeks to determine if their lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly would diminish, as assessed by standardized computerized tomography. Neither pyrimethamine alone or with sulfadoxine in the MRL/lpr-/- mice, nor pyrimethamine alone in ALPS patients proved efficacious. We conclude that these drugs do not warrant further use empirically or as part of clinical trials in ALPS Type Ia as a lympholytic agent.
The possible maternal hepatic and reproductive effects of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) were assessed in rats given 0, 36, 120, 360, and 1200 mg/kg/day of TCB on Days 9-13 of gestation. The animals were sacrificed on Day 14 of pregnancy. Maternal deaths (2/9 rats, 6/6 rats) were recorded in the 360 and 1200 mg/kg/day treatment groups and body weight gain was significantly decreased in the 360 mg/kg/day TCB group. Maternal liver weight, liver/body weight ratio, and hepatic microsomal protein content were unaffected by TCB treatment. Although Day 14 NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity was affected only at 360 mg/kg/day TCB, the maternal hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 content was significantly increased by administration of both 120 and 360 mg/kg/day of TCB. Hepatic microsomal aminopyrine N-demethylase, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, and UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity towards p-nitrophenol were also increased at 120 and 360 mg/kg TCB. Glutathione S-transferase activity to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1,2 dichloro-4-nitrobenzene were both increased by pretreatment with TCB. Although pretreatment with 360 mg/kg/day TCB did not increase resorptions, embryolethality, or teratogenicity, embryonic development was significantly retarded by all four growth criteria used (head length, crown-rump length, somite number, and protein content).
The use of gemeprost vaginal pessaries is generally thought to be a method with little complications used for cervical softening within the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Though in our hospital two cases presented with severe cardiovascular reactions, to be attributed to the effect of prostaglandins. The first patient experienced a severe cardiogenic shock due to vasospasm several hours after primary administration of gemeprost vaginal pessaries and a cerebral stroke some hours later. The second patient suffered of a myocardial infarction ensuing from coronary spasm.
The phosphodiesterase inhibitor oxpentifylline (OXP) has a number of potentially important immunomodulatory actions which include a selective inhibition of the Th1 subset of CD4+ cells in vitro and inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA transcription. In vivo, it has a dramatic protective effect against experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. In this animal model, tissue injury is associated with both a Th1 response and with TNF-alpha production, either of which could be targets for the protective action of OXP. In an attempt to clarify the relative importance of the Th cell subsets and TNF-alpha in pathogenesis, we investigated the effect of OXP on a Th2 model of T cell-dependent disease, mercuric chloride (HgCl2)-induced autoimmunity in the Brown Norway rat. The effects of OXP on the Th1:Th2 response, TNF-alpha mRNA transcription in spleen and ankle joints, and on the incidence and severity of arthritis and cecal vasculitis have been examined and the effects in vivo have been compared with those of a soluble TNF receptor-IgG1 fusion protein (sTNFR) that neutralizes rat TNF-alpha. In two separate experiments, OXP significantly enhanced unstimulated levels of splenic interleukin-4 (IL-4) mRNA (median 62%, of an artificial IL-4 mRNA construct, vs. 36.5% in controls) and in one experiment, exaggerated the total IgE response to HgCl2. OXP inhibited HgCl2-induced TNF-alpha mRNA transcription in spleen and ankle joints. In three separate experiments, OXP had a significant protective effect against arthritis, with the mean incidence reduced from 100% to 30% and mean peak score reduced from 7.2 to 2.59 (experiments 1 and 2). The protection against arthritis was indistinguishable from that produced by sTNFR. There was no such protection against cecal vasculitis with either OXP or sTNFR. These results demonstrate that OXP induces a shift towards a Th2 response, inhibits TNF-alpha mRNA transcription locally in joint and systemically in spleen, and has a protective effect against arthritis similar to that produced by sTNFR in the HgCl2-treated BN rat. We conclude that TNF-alpha is a critical cytokine in the pathogenesis of arthritis but not cecal vasculitis in this model, and that inhibition of TNF-alpha transcription is the most important mode of action of OXP in this situation. OXP may be a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of other arthritides, such as human rheumatoid arthritis, in which TNF-alpha has been implicated in pathogenesis.
Gallic acid is a polyphenolic compound and is reported to be renoprotective because of its antioxidant activity in various preclinical studies. Gallic acid has been reported to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) in vitro. However, the relevance of the interplay between gallic acid and PPAR-γ in various pathologic conditions is yet to be established in vivo. The present study investigated the protective role of gallic acid against ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and the possible involvement of PPAR-γ in gallic acid-mediated renoprotection.
The AKI was induced in rats through bilateral clamping of renal arteries for 40 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h. The AKI was assessed by the quantification of creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, potassium level, fractional excretion of sodium, and urinary microproteins. The oxidative stress in renal tissues was quantified in terms of myeloperoxidase activity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, superoxide anion generation, and reduced glutathione level. The histopathologic changes in renal tissues were assessed by hemotoxylin and eosin staining. The rats were administered gallic acid (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) orally for 7 d before subjecting them to AKI.
The renal ischemia-reperfusion induced significant changes in plasma, urinary, and tissue parameters. The administration of gallic acid at three dose levels offered a significant protection against renal ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI. The prior treatment with PPAR-γ antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, significantly abolished the renoprotective effect of gallic acid that confirms the involvement of PPAR-γ in gallic acid-mediated renoprotection.
It is concluded that the activation of PPAR-γ significantly contributes toward gallic acid-mediated protection against ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI.
Alkyl-phenanthrenes are a class of compounds present in crude oil and toxic to developing fish. Most research on alkyl-phenanthrenes has focused on retene (7-isopropyl-1-methyl-phenanthrene), but little is known about the chronic toxicity of related congeners to the early life stages of fish. This project is the first to describe the chronic toxicity of a series of alkyl-phenanthrenes to the embryos of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) using the partition-controlled delivery (PCD) method of exposure and is the first to establish a relationship between toxicity of alkyl-phenanthrenes and log P. With PCD, test concentrations were maintained by equilibrium partitioning of test chemicals from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films containing various concentrations of C1 to C4 phenanthrenes. Log film:solution partition constants (log K(fs)) and aqueous solubility limits were determined for each alkyl-phenanthrene. The prevalence of abnormalities in fish embryos increased in an exposure-dependent manner, with median effective concentration (EC50) values lower than experimental solubility limits of the compounds, and typical of environmental concentrations. Alkyl-phenanthrenes were more toxic to medaka embryos than unsubstituted phenanthrene, with effects resembling those of dioxin and indicating a specific receptor-based mechanism of toxicity. These results extend conclusions for the Exxon Valdez oil spill, suggest a specific mechanism of toxicity for alkyl-phenanthrenes, and provide a model for assessing the risks of mixture toxicity.
The human nephrotic syndrome (NS) is accompanied by important alterations of mineral and bone metabolism. The purpose of the present study was to examine bone metabolism in rats with experimental NS and normal creatinine clearance, and to evaluate the reversibility of this alteration. NS was induced by three injections of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) on days 0, 21, and 35 (10, 5, and 5 mg/100 g body weight, respectively). The biochemical markers of bone formation (osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase) and bone resorption (hydroxyproline and pyridinoline), bone mineral content (BMC), and bone mineral density (BMD), determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), were studied on days 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 84, and 112. Proteinuria was present throughout the study. Hypoproteinemia was seen on days 7, 28, 42, and 56, returning to control values on days 84 and 112. In serum, osteocalcin (OC) concentration increased (p < 0.001), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) decreased (p = 0.002). In urine, hydroxyproline increased (p < 0.001), but urinary pyridinoline was not different from the control group throughout the study. Increased serum parathyroid hormone concentration and decreased levels of 25-hydroxy and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were found from day 7. During the intense proteinuria, bone resorption predominates and decreased BMC and BMD ensues in PAN-nephrotic rats. PAN-nephrotic rats showed low BMC and BMD compared to control group (p < 0.001). At the end of the study, when proteinuria persisted but total serum protein returned to control values, the biochemical bone markers, BMC, and BMD returned to normal. In conclusion, PAN-nephrotic rats had reversible bone alterations that were related to the magnitude of proteinuria and the concentration of total serum protein.
Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin-angiotensin system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic syndrome (NS). In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of angiotensinogen (Ao) were analyzed with the slot-blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues: kidney, heart, brain, and adrenal gland from control, nephrotic, and pair-fed (PF) rats. NS was induced by a single injection of puromycin amino-nucleoside (PAN). Although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after PAN injection, when NS was clearly established, hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change. Furthermore, the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6, nor did its hepatic levels at days 1, 3, 5, or 7 after PAN injection. These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute NS induced by PAN.
Psychopharmacological treatments for methamphetamine (MA) dependence have questionable efficacy. Open-label risperidone was evaluated in veterans seeking MA dependence treatment. Participants (N = 11) received four weeks of risperidone. They provided weekly self-reports of substance use, urine drug screens, and adverse effects. Neuropsychological assessments and psychiatric symptomatology (Brief Symptom Inventory; BSI) were measured at baseline and follow-up. The eight completers had an average risperidone dose of 3.6 mg/day and decreased days of MA use during the trial from a mean of 13.0 (SD = 6.5) in the 30 days prior to starting risperidone to a mean of 0.125 (SD = 0.4; t = 5.7, p = .001), When measured over time, fine motor function (Grooved Peg Board Dominant Hand) was the only neuropsychological domain to improve significantly. No other domain changed significantly from baseline to follow-up among study completers. BSI data were converted to demographically corrected T-scores utilizing appropriate normative data (mean = 50, SD = 10). BSI somatization T-scores declined from a mean of 59.0 (SD = 8.4) to 51.8 (SD = 8.3; t = 2.7, p <.05), and positive symptom distress declined from a mean of 52.8 (SD =8.0) to 41.7 (SD = 8.6; t= 3.0, p <.05). Risperidone was well tolerated and associated with decreased MA use.
A patient is described who suffered hypersenitivity reactions (anorexia, nausea and vomiting) as well as cholestatic jaundice from therapy with azathioprine. Evidence is given that the 2 reactions were mediated by different portions of the azathioprine molecule.
To investigate the protective effect of resvertrol on the intestinal mucosal cells in rats with severe acute pancreatitis and explore the possible mechanism.
Twenty-four SD rats were randomly divided into the sham-operation (SO) group, severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) group and resveratrol-treated (RES) group. In the SO group, the pancreases were slightly flipped only. In the SAP and RES groups, SAP model was established by retrograde injection of 40 g/L sodium chrolate (1 ml/kg) through the pancreatic duct, and in the latter group, resveratrol (10 mg/kg) was given intravenously. Specimens were obtained 6 h after SAP model establishment and the endotoxin levels in the portal vein was determined with turbidimetry to evaluate the effect of resversatrol on the intestinal endotoxin translocation in SAP rats. Apoptosis of the mucosal cells was detected by TUNEL methods, and the expression of bax and bcl-2 mRNA were determined by RT-PCR. The mitochondrial membrane potential of the intestinal mucosal cells was measured by confocal microscopy.
The endotoxin levels in the portal vein were significantly lower in RES group than in SAP group (P<0.01). TUNEL assay demonstrated significantly higher apoptotic index of the mucosal cells in SAP group than that in RES group (P<0.01). The expression of Bax mRNA in the intestinal mucosal cell was significantly higher in SAP group than in RES group (P<0.01), whereas the expression of bcl-2 mRNA was significantly lower in SAP group (P<0.01). The mitochondrial membrane potential of the intestinal mucosal cell was significantly lower in SAP group than in RES group (P<0.01).
Resvertrol can inhibit the apoptosis of the intestinal mucosa cells and maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier to prevent the bacterial and endotoxin translocation in SAP.
Vitamin D3 reduces human rectal crypt cell production rate (CCPR) and may thereby protect against colorectal cancer. Cell turnover is increased in ulcerative proctocolitis, which might therefore respond to vitamin D3 metabolites. This study investigated the effect of calcipotriol, a synthetic vitamin D3 analogue that avoids hypercalcaemia, on human rectal CCPR in ulcerative proctocolitis. Paired rectal biopsy specimens from seven patients with severe disease were established in organ culture with or without calcipotriol (1 x 10(-6) M). After 15 hours, vincristine (0.6 microgram/ml) was added to induce metaphase arrest, and CCPR was determined by linear regression analysis of accumulated metaphases. Compared with values in 17 controls with incidental anal conditions, median rectal CCPR was 28% higher in ulcerative proctocolitis: 5.90 (5.00-9.50) v 4.80 (2.85-7.07) cells/crypt/hour (p < 0.01). Calcipotriol reduced CCPR by 62% in patients with ulcerative proctocolitis, from 5.90 (5.00-9.50) to 2.21 (0.81-3.22) cells/crypt/hour (median with range) p < 0.01. Thus calcipotriol can dampen the hyperproliferative state in ulcerative proctocolitis and could have a therapeutic role in the control of this inflammatory condition.
Creatine transporter deficiency is an X-linked mental retardation disorder caused by mutations in the creatine transporter gene, SLC6A8. In a European Mental Retardation Consortium panel of 66 patients, we identified a male with mental retardation, caused by a c.1059_1061delCTT; p.Phe354del mutation in the SLC6A8 gene. With the use of direct DNA sequencing, the mutation was also found in the brother of the proband, but not in their mother. However, by analyzing EDTA blood of the mother with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), we could show that the mother displays low-level somatic mosaicism for the three base-pair deletion. This study indicates DHPLC as an important tool in the detection of low-level mosaicism, as does it illustrate the importance of considering somatic and germline mosaicism in the case of apparent de novo mutation.
To report a case of probable famotidine-induced mixed hepatocellular jaundice.
A 55-year-old man presented with a one-month history of mid-epigastric pain. Initial physical examination and laboratory studies, including liver enzyme concentration tests, were unrevealing. A diagnosis of gastritis was made and ranitidine was prescribed. Following one week of therapy, the patient's symptoms had not improved and therapy was changed to famotidine and sucralfate. Approximately one week later the patient presented with jaundice. Liver enzyme concentrations were elevated and the patient was hospitalized for further evaluation. Five days following discontinuation of famotidine, liver enzyme concentrations were normal and jaundice had resolved. Further tests did not reveal any pathologic etiology.
Hepatic changes have occurred in patients receiving histamine2-antagonists; ranitidine and cimetidine have been cited most frequently. In general, the elevations are mild, transient, and return to baseline with continued therapy. This is one of the first case reports of probable famotidine-induced mixed hepatocellular jaundice.
There was a temporal relationship between the patient's signs and symptoms and initiation of famotidine. No identifiable factors contributed to the elevated liver enzyme concentrations and jaundice.
To report a case of hepatitis induced by two histamine (H2)-receptor blockers, famotidine and cimetidine.
A 51-year-old obese woman with a duodenal ulcer developed symptomatic, famotidine-induced hepatitis. Other causes for hepatitis were ruled out. Famotidine was discontinued and the patient took omeprazole for a month without incident. Cimetidine therapy was then initiated and shortly thereafter, the patient developed another episode of symptomatic hepatitis that resolved upon drug discontinuation. Two abdominal ultrasound examinations six months apart and an abdominal computed tomography scan obtained later showed what appeared to be a stable, fatty liver.
This appears to be the first reported case of clinical hepatitis related to famotidine and the first reported case where clinical hepatitis followed the administration of two different H2-receptor blockers. The fatty liver probably was secondary to obesity and incidental to the hepatitis episodes.
Famotidine can cause clinical hepatitis, and drug-induced hepatitis can occur after the administration of two different H2-receptor blockers.
To examine the mechanisms by which licochalcone B (LCB) inhibits the proliferation of human malignant bladder cancer cell lines (T24 and EJ) in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo in MB49 (murine bladder cancer cell line) tumor model. Exposure of T24 or EJ cells to LCB significantly inhibited cell lines proliferation in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner, and resulted in S phase arrest in T24 or EJ cells, respectively. LCB treatment decreased the expression of cyclin A, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1 and CDK2) mRNA, cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25A and Cdc25B) protein. In addition, LCB treatment down-regulated Bcl-2 and survivin expression, enhanced Bax expression, activated caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein. Consistently, the tumorigenicity of LCB-treated MB49 cells was limited significantly by using the colony formation assay in vitro and the MB49 tumor model performed in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. These findings provide support for the use of LCB in chemoprevention and bladder cancer therapy.
The preservative methyldibromo glutaronitrilc (MDBGN) is used non-occupationally and occupationally. High contact allergy rates have been reported when tested in consecutive dermatitis patients as well as clinical cases with allergic contact dermatitis. Up till now there has been no agreement on which patch test preparation to use to trace contact allergy to MDBGN. From the year 2005 on, MDBGN at 0.5% w/w in petrolatum is recommended for the European standard patch test series. The choice of 0.5% is based on consideration of rates of contact allergy, doubtful and irritant reactions, as well as on information on clinical relevance represented by results of a repeated open application test, and patch test concentrations to diagnose allergic contact dermatitis from MDBGN in individual cases.
We previously reported that cocaine may induce activation of cortical (cEEG) and hippocampal (hEEG) electroencephalographic signals, concurrent with inhibition of penile erection, via an action on the hippocampal formation. The present study further evaluates the role of noradrenergic neurotransmission at the hippocampal formation in this process, using adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats anaesthetized and maintained by chloral hydrate. Unilateral microinjection of cocaine (100 nmoles) into the hippocampal CA1 or CA3 subfield or dentate gyrus elicited significant activation of both cEEG and hEEG activity. At the same time, the intracavernous pressure (ICP), our experimental index for penile erection, underwent a discernible reduction. Co-administration of equimolar doses (250 pmoles) of prazosin, naftopidil, yohimbine or rauwolscine significantly reversed those effects elicited by cocaine on cEEG, hEEG and ICP. Microinjection unilaterally of equimolar doses (5 nmoles) of norepinephrine, phenylephrine or BHT 933 into the hippocampal formation, similar to cocaine, also induced appreciable cEEG and hEEG excitation, with a simultaneous decrease in ICP. We conclude that cocaine may activate cEEG and hEEG and decrease ICP via noradrenergic neurotransmission, possibly engaging at least alpha(1A/D)-, alpha(2B)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors at the hippocampal formation.
Contact allergy to and allergic contact dermatitis from methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDBGN) have frequently been reported. This study was initiated to help determine the optimal patch test preparation for MDBGN. In 51 patients with a doubtful or a positive patch test reaction to at least 1 of 4 test preparations with MDBGN in petrolatum at 1.0% w/w, 0.5%, 0.3% and 0.1%, a repeated open application test (ROAT) with moisturizers with and without MDBGN at 0.03% w/w was performed on the upper arms for 2 weeks. 18 of the 51 (35.3%) patients developed a positive ROAT. In all patients, there was a positive ROAT only to the moisturizer with MDBGN (P < 0.001). A statistically significant association was also found between the patch test reactivity (PTRL) and the outcome of the ROAT (P < 0.001). If only considering those with a PTRL above 0.3%, thus with negative or doubtful test reactions to 0.1% and 0.3%, there were still statistically significantly more patients with a positive ROAT to the moisturizer with MDBGN than to the moisturizer without MDBGN. The study demonstrates that patch testing with MDBGN at 0.3% and 0.1% will miss clinically relevant patch test reactions to MDBGN.
The graded and quantal responses of metoclopramide (MCL, Paspertin) were studied in patients (17-71 years) treated with cisplatin in combination with other cytostatics. The lowest dose of MCL was 0.125 mg/kg b.w./h i.v. over 2 h as loading infusion, then 0.0625 mg/kg/h over 24 h as the maintenance infusion, the total dose being 1.75 mg/kg per treatment cycle (n = 25). At the same schedule three different higher doses of MCL were run with total doses of 3.5 (n = 44), 7.0 (n = 120), and 14.0 (n = 161) mg/kg per cycle of cisplatin. The mean number of emetic episodes in historical control patients without MCL (n = 41) at the four different doses of cisplatin was 4.2 episodes at 25 mg/m2 of cisplatin, 6.9 episodes at 60 mg/m2, 14.9 at 90, and 21.6 episodes at 120 mg/m2 of cisplatin. The quantitative dose-response curves of the four doses of the emetic agonist cisplatin were shifted to the right by increasing doses of MCL. The following doses of cisplatin for greater than or equal to 95% antiemetic protection (i.e. only 0-2 emetic episodes as clinically sufficient protection) were obtained (at the respective mg/kg of MCL given in brackets): 13 (at 1.75 MCL), 25 (at 3.5 MCL), 42 (at 7 MCL), and 80 (at 14 MCL) mg/m2 of cisplatin, respectively. The MCL dose in order to provide greater than or equal to 95% of the patients against every mg/m2 of cisplatin was about 0.15 (range 0.13-0.18) mg/kg MCL per cycle (i.e. 6.5 mg/m2 of cisplatin are antagonized by 1 mg/kg of MCL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The anion gap in myeloma patients had been well studied. IgG myeloma usually has decreased anion gap, whereas IgA myeloma always presents with normal anion gap. We report an unusual presentation of IgA myeloma with decreased anion gap and renal failure due to superimposing of acetazolamide-related bicarbonate loss.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates a variety of biological effects by binding to environmental pollutants, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin). Although numerous animal studies have demonstrated the harmful effects of dioxins, it remains controversial whether dioxins pose a risk to human health. Enhanced lytic replication of EBV is a risk factor for the development of autoimmune diseases and cancers. This study evaluated the possibility that ligand-activated AhR reactivates EBV. EBV reactivation and AhR transactivation were evaluated with luciferase assays. Saliva samples were collected from 19 patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Control saliva samples were obtained from 10 healthy individuals and nine patients with severe dry mouth. TCDD enhanced BZLF1 transcription, which mediates the switch from the latent to the lytic form of EBV infection in EBV-positive B cell lines and in a salivary gland epithelial cell line. Moreover, TCDD-induced increases in BZLF1 mRNA and EBV genomic DNA levels were confirmed in the B cell lines. Saliva from SS patients activated the transcription of both CYP1A1 and BZLF1. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between CYP1A1 and BZLF1 promoter activities. AhR ligands elicited the reactivation of EBV in activated B cells and salivary epithelial cells, and these ligands are involved in SS. Our findings reveal novel aspects of the biological effects of dioxin and the AhR-dependent pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.
We report a case of the heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome presenting with acute ischemia of a lower limb. The patient was successfully treated by withdrawal of heparin products, intraarterial urokinase, and platelet anti-aggregation therapy consisting of Dextran and aspirin.
Alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes and serum levels are presented for a family in which two brothers have Weber Christian disease and alpha 1 antitrypsin (PI) Z phenotypes. Clinical histories are described for these two men. A younger brother has the PI Z phenotype but does not have the disease, indicating that additional genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of Weber Christian disease. However, the two cases described provide additional evidence for a relationship between alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and the development of symptoms.
