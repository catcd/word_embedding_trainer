The authors report a new case of extra-dural hematoma of the spinal cord due to anticoagulants causing a clinical Brown-Sequard syndrome. Spontaneous recovery, which was almost complete, appears quite exceptional.
Myositis was diagnosed twenty months after starting treatment with d-penicillamine in a patient suffering from uncomplicated rheumatoid arthritis for nearly three years. The diagnosis was established by electromyographic investigation and by biopsy. In this patient d-penicillamine had been intermittently increased to a dose over 1 g per day and then reduced because of mild proteinuria. The appearance of myositis during d-penicillamine therapy, its immediate regression on discontinuing the drug, and the absence of signs of vasculitis or other extraarticular manifestations in this patient suggest that this complication may be drug-induced. The clinical course is compared with isolated cases reported in the literature. The significance of this rare side effect is discussed.
A case of cardiorespiratory arrest in a 28 year old man after cocaine and heroin ingestion is described. The arrest is attributed primarily to hyperkalaemia/rhabdomyolysis-a recognised consequence of each of these drugs. The administration of naloxone may have been contributory. He developed acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with consequent lower limb compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. Ventricular fibrillation was identified at thoracotomy.
Prostaglandins of the E series inhibit the development of Th1 responses. When infected with Leishmania major, BALB/c mice fail to develop a Th1 response, but instead mount a Th2 response and die of the disease. Therefore, we treated L. major-infected BALB/c mice with indomethacin, which inhibits prostaglandin production. Indomethacin lessened disease severity (parasite burden and pathology), and promoted a Th1 response, but the mice still succumbed to infection. The explanation for these observations may be two-fold: (1) the beneficial effects of indomethacin were predominantly observed later in infection (beyond two weeks), a time at which indomethacin was unable to sufficiently block the development of a Th2 response; (2) indomethacin was unable to induce a Th1 response in BALB/c mice that was of the same magnitude as the Th1 response observed in C57BL/6 mice infected with L. major.
The effects of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), a neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, on spontaneous locomotor activity, morphine-induced hyperactivity, acquisition of place conditioning and morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) were evaluated in male mice. In experiment 1, animals treated with 7-NI (25, 50 and 100mg/kg), morphine (40 mg/kg) or morphine (40 mg/kg) plus 7-NI (25, 50 or 100mg/kg) were placed in an actimeter for 3h. In experiment 2, animals treated with the same drugs and doses were conditioned following an unbiased procedure. 7-NI did not affect the spontaneous locomotor activity or hyperactivity induced by morphine. However, the moderate and high doses of 7-NI produced conditioned place aversion (CPA) and the lowest dose blocked morphine-induced CPP. Our results suggest that nitric oxide is involved in the rewarding properties of morphine but not in its motor effects.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors, which belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Some PPARgamma agonists, such as pioglitazone, and dual PPARgamma/PPARalpha agonists, such as muraglitazar, induced urothelial bladder tumors in rats but not in mice. In this study, we investigated the early effects in the urine and bladder of rats treated with pioglitazone to evaluate the possible relation between urinary solids formation and urothelial cytotoxicity and regenerative proliferation. In a 4-week experiment, treatment of rats with 16 mg/kg pioglitazone induced cytotoxicity and necrosis of the urothelial superficial layer, with increased cell proliferation measured by bromodeoxyuridine labeling index and hyperplasia by histology. It also produced alterations in urinary solid formation, especially calcium-containing crystals and calculi. PPARgamma agonists (pioglitazone and troglitazone) in vitro reduced rat urothelial cell proliferation and induced uroplakin synthesis, a specific differentiation marker in urothelial cells. Our data support the hypothesis that the bladder tumors produced in rats by pioglitazone are related to the formation of urinary solids. This strongly supports the previous conclusion in studies with muraglitazar that this is a rat-specific phenomenon and does not pose a urinary bladder cancer risk to humans treated with these agents.
Intraductal administration of a c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor enhances islet viability. However, its role in reducing the inflammatory response in islets is unknown. It is also unknown whether a JNK inhibitor could act in synergy with statins. We examined if the sequential combination of a JNK inhibitor and simvastatin would reduce islet inflammation and improve islet viability. We performed porcine islet isolation with or without intraductal administration of SP600125, a JNK inhibitor. This was followed by culture medium supplementation with either nicotinamide alone or nicotinamide plus simvastatin. We assessed the viability of islets by flow cytometry, islet loss during overnight culture, graft function in NOD/SCID mice, and expression of inflammation-related genes in islets. The sequential combination of a JNK inhibitor and simvastatin increased the β-cell viability index of porcine islets cultured overnight (p = 0.015) as well as islet viability as assessed by a DNA binding dye staining (p = 0.011). The combination of a JNK inhibitor and simvastatin significantly increased the islet survival rate (p = 0.027) when the histomorphometry of donor pancreas indicated a large islet proportion of greater than 50.55%. When we transplanted the same islet mass per recipient for each group, there was no difference in overall islet graft function. Intraductal administration of JNK inhibitor significantly suppressed mRNA expression levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, IL-8, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1. It also decreased the concentration of IL-1β (p = 0.040) and IL-8 (p = 0.023) in the culture supernatant. In conclusion, the sequential combination of a JNK inhibitor and simvastatin protected porcine islets from peritransplant apoptosis. Inhibition of JNK reduced the inflammatory response and could be considered an alternative target for suppression of porcine islet inflammation.
To describe a case of a patient experiencing testicular pain on 3 occasions after taking 3 different statins.
A 54-year-old man with hyperlipidemia was started on lovastatin therapy. His other medications included aspirin, levothyroxine, buspirone, and atenolol. Seven months after starting lovastatin, the patient experienced testicular discomfort that resolved upon discontinuation of the drug. Afterward, he started simvastatin and again experienced testicular discomfort. The simvastatin was changed to atorvastatin, and the pain resolved. However, 3 months after starting atorvastatin, the patient developed testicular pain, which resolved after the drug was stopped. During each of the episodes, the patient's pain increased when he was sitting, driving, or wearing tight clothing. The Naranjo probability scale indicates that statins probably caused the patient's pain.
Testicular pain is rarely caused by medications. Product labeling for statins does not list urinary adverse events as common. However, labeling for atorvastatin and pravastatin lists rare urologic adverse effects. A literature search did not reveal any previously reported cases of testicular adverse effects from statins. However, statins have been shown to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the testis. Some data indicate that statins reduce serum testosterone concentrations, but other data indicate that statins have no effect on sex hormones or spermatogenesis. Data are also available indicating that aspirin might affect testosterone concentrations and testicular function. It is difficult to know whether either of the above hormonal mechanisms was associated with our patient's testicular discomfort, but the time course and challenge/rechallenge aspects of the case suggest that the statins were the cause.
Urologic adverse effects of statins rarely occur but should not be overlooked by medical providers.
Turner's syndrome, a sex-chromosome abnormality, is often accompanied by cardiovascular disorders, such as coarctation of the aorta. We encountered a case of Turner's syndrome with meningioma and pituitary hyperplasia which resulted in death from dissection of the aorta. The patient was 36-year-old female who was diagnosed as having Turner's syndrome of mosaic-type at the age of 15. She had accepted sex-hormone replacement with estrogen and progesterone over 20 years. She lost consciousness and was transferred to our institute on June 20th, 1992. She was in shock but her condition began to improve after intensive treatment. CT scan revealed a calcified mass lesion at the left frontal convexity and a markedly enhanced round mass lesion at the suprasellar region. Angiography showed tumor stain of the suprasellar region fed by the posterior ethmoidal artery. These tumors were diagnosed as multiple meningiomas. She developed dyspnea on June 24th and chest X-ray showed right pleural fluid collection and cardiomegaly. This condition was diagnosed as congestive heart failure. Her condition was getting worse and she suffered abrupt cardiac arrest on June 28th. Autopsy revealed dissection of the aorta as the cause of death. The tumor of the convexity was meningioma, and the suprasellar lesion was diagnosed as pituitary hyperplasia. It is well known that frequent excess dose injection of estrogen can induce pituitary adenoma or hyperplasia in rats. In this case, the presence of pituitary hyperplasia was thought to be the result of long-term injection of estrogen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Ochratoxin A (OTA) can induce renal tumors that originate from the S3 segment of the proximal tubules in rodents, but the results of conventional mutagenicity tests have caused controversy regarding the role of genotoxic mechanisms in the carcinogenesis. Human exposure to OTA from various foods is unavoidable. Therefore, an understanding of OTA-induced renal carcinogenesis is necessary for accurate estimates of the human risk hazard. In the present study, a 13-week exposure of gpt delta rats to OTA at a carcinogenic dose induced karyomegaly and apoptosis at the outer stripe of the outer medulla (OM) of the kidney but failed to affect the reporter gene mutations in DNA extracted from whole kidneys. This site specificity resulting from the kinetics of specific transporters might be responsible for the negative outcome of in vivo mutagenicity. The kidney was then macroscopically divided, based on anatomical characteristics, into the cortex, the OM, and the inner medulla, each of which was histopathologically confirmed. Spi⁻ mutant frequencies (MFs) but not gpt MFs in the OM after a 4-week exposure to OTA were significantly higher than in controls despite the absence of cortical changes. There were also no changes in 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels in kidney DNA. These results strongly suggest the involvement of a genotoxic mechanism, with the exception of oxidative DNA damage in OTA-induced renal carcinogenesis. In addition, the reporter gene mutation assay using DNA from target sites could be a more powerful tool to investigate in vivo genotoxicities.
The authors report ten cases of acute recurrent pericarditis observed over a period of 5 years and emphasize the frequency of these relapses involving 15 to 20% of cases of acute pericarditis. Usually, no cause is found and, althrough an immunological mechanism has been suggested, there is no common test which may confirm or disprove this theory. The risk of ultimate constrictive pericarditis is minimal and this risk is thus not taken into consideration in deciding on treatment. On the other hand, the undesirable effects of corticosteroids which favour relapses, seem to be demonstrated. The use of corticosteroids in cases of acute pericarditis should thus be exceptional and one should prefer non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Immunosuppressors and pericardectomy should be reserved for the rare forms where the disease progresses and relapses continue after cortisone has been stopped.
Treatment with arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) by inducing apoptosis and partial differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells results in clinical remission in APL patients resistant to chemotherapy and all-trans-retinoic acid. As(2)O(3) (iAs(III)) is methylated in the liver to mono- and dimethylated metabolites, including methylarsonic acid, methylarsonous acid, dimethylarsinic acid, and dimethylarsinous acid. Methylated trivalent metabolites that are potent cytotoxins, genotoxins, and enzyme inhibitors may contribute to the in vivo therapeutic effect of iAs(III). Therefore, we compared the potency of iAs(III) and trivalent metabolites using chemical precursors of methylarsonous acid and dimethylarsinous acid to induce differentiation, growth inhibition, and apoptosis. Methylarsine oxide (MAs(III)O) and to a lesser extent iododimethylarsine were more potent growth inhibitors and apoptotic inducers than iAs(III) in NB4 cells, an APL cell line. This was also observed in K562 human leukemia, lymphoma cell lines, and in primary culture of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, but not human bone marrow progenitor cells. Apoptosis was associated with greater hydrogen peroxide accumulation and inhibition of glutathione peroxidase activity. MAs(III)O, in contrast to iAs(III), did not induce PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha degradation, or restore PML nuclear bodies or differentiation in NB4 cells. In a cocultivation experiment, hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells, but not NB4 cells, methylate radiolabeled iAs(III). Methylated metabolites released from HepG2 cells are preferentially accumulated by NB4 cells. This experimental model suggests that in vivo hepatic methylation of iAs(III) may contribute to As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis but not differentiation of APL cells. MAs(III)O as an apoptotic inducer should be considered in the treatment of other hematologic malignancies like lymphoma.
Imidazole (IMID) inhibited (+/-) N-n-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) and BHT-920 induced penile erections (PE) and stretching and yawning (SY) in rats as well as apomorphine (APO) induced hypothermia in mice, enhanced shock-elicited aggressiveness in rats and antagonized sleep induced by clonidine in chicks. IMID moreover displayed activity in behavioural tests used in specific screening for antidepressants, potentiating yohimbine toxicity in mice and antagonizing immobility time in the despair test, with a potency in some cases equal to imipramine. IMID per se, depressed motor activity in both mice and rats. The possible mechanism of action and receptors involved are briefly discussed as well as IMID's profile as an antidepressant drug.
The efficacy and safety of oral nifedipine and diltiazem were compared in 20 patients with stable angina pectoris with use of a placebo run-in, randomized, double-blind titration to maximal effect crossover protocol. The effects of treatment withdrawal were also analyzed. All patients received placebo for 2 weeks and were then randomly assigned to receive either diltiazem or nifedipine. A 2 week drug titration phase in which patients received either diltiazem (180 to 360 mg/day) or nifedipine (30 to 120 mg/day) in three divided doses was followed by a 1 week maintenance phase. Patients then received placebo for 1 to 2 weeks, followed by crossover to the other treatment regimen and a second placebo washout period of 1 week. Patients (n = 13) who remained symptomatic on both diltiazem and nifedipine during the monotherapy periods entered a 3 week combination treatment phase, followed by a final 1 week placebo washout period. Frequency of angina, nitroglycerin consumption, exercise tolerance (Naughton protocol), and frequency of daily episodes of ST segment deviations on the electrocardiogram (1 mm of ST segment depression persisting for at least 1 min with and without chest pain) on an ambulatory electrocardiographic monitor were assessed during the baseline placebo, active monotherapy, placebo withdrawal, and combination treatment phases. Plasma drug levels were also measured. Compared with initial placebo values, the frequency of angina and the amount of nitroglycerin treatment were reduced by both diltiazem (p less than .001) and nifedipine (p less than .02). Diltiazem was more effective than nifedipine in reducing angina (p less than .02). Exercise duration increased with both drugs (p less than .0001). Diltiazem was significantly better than nifedipine in reducing the episodes of ST segment depression on the ambulatory monitor (p less than .01). Diltiazem reduced the resting heart rate (p less than .01); both drugs reduced the resting blood pressure and rate-pressure product. Overall, combination therapy was more effective in patients who did not maximally respond to diltiazem or nifedipine alone with respect to anginal and exercise variables and in reducing blood pressure at rest and during exercise. Plasma drug levels could not predict an individual patient's treatment response. Diltiazem may increase nifedipine drug levels when the drugs are combined. Fewer side effects were observed with diltiazem than nifedipine; the most side effects were seen with combination treatment. There were no apparent withdrawal effects observed with either treatment regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
To distinguish adverse events related to ribavirin therapy from those attributable to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and to determine the rate of potential ribavirin-related adverse events.
Retrospective cohort study.
Hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
A cohort of 306 patients with confirmed or probable SARS, 183 of whom received ribavirin and 123 of whom did not, between February 23, 2003, and July 1, 2003. Of the 183 treated patients, 155 (85%) received very high-dose ribavirin; the other 28 treated patients received lower-dose regimens.
Data on all patients with SARS admitted to hospitals in Toronto were abstracted from charts and electronic databases onto a standardized form by trained research nurses. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between ribavirin use and each adverse event (progressive anemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, bradycardia, transaminitis, and hyperamylasemia) after adjusting for SARS-related prognostic factors and corticosteroid use. In the primary logistic regression analysis, ribavirin use was strongly associated with anemia (odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 99% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-6.1, p<0.0001), hypomagnesemia (OR 21, 99% CI 5.8-73, p<0.0001), and bradycardia (OR 2.3, 99% CI 1.0-5.1, p=0.007). Hypocalcemia, transaminitis, and hyperamylasemia were not associated with ribavirin use. The risk of anemia, hypomagnesemia, and bradycardia attributable to ribavirin use was 27%, 45%, and 17%, respectively.
High-dose ribavirin is associated with a high rate of adverse events. The use of high-dose ribavirin is appropriate only for the treatment of infectious diseases for which ribavirin has proven clinical efficacy, or in the context of a clinical trial. Ribavirin should not be used empirically for the treatment of viral syndromes of unknown origin.
Flumazenil is frequently administered to the poisoned patient. Seizures may be precipitated and resedation may occur in patients who awakened following flumazenil administration. Seizures may increase morbidity and mortality of the overdose. Benefit:Risk ratio of administering flumazenil should be determined in each overdose patient. Indications for flumazenil are limited.
Inhaled particulate matter is associated with increased cerebro- and cardiovascular events. However, the systemic mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the relationship between airway and systemic inflammation and pial cerebral venular thrombosis, 24h after intratracheal (i.t.) instillation of diesel exhaust particles (DEP; 15 or 30 microg/mouse) or saline (control). Doses of 15 and 30 microg/mouse induced a dose-dependent macrophage and neutrophil influx into the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid with elevation of total proteins and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), but without IL-6 release. Similarly, in plasma, IL-6 concentrations did not increase but the TEAC was significantly and dose-dependently decreased. The number of platelets and the tail bleeding time were both significantly reduced after exposure to DEP (30 microg). Interestingly, the same dose showed platelet proaggregatory effect in mouse pial cerebral venules. Pretreatment with the cysteine prodrug l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTC, 80 mg/kg) 24 and 1h before i.t. DEP (30 microg), abolished the DEP-induced macrophage and neutrophil influx, and the increase of TEAC in BAL. Lung histopathology confirmed the protective effect of OTC on DEP-induced lung inflammation. OTC also reversed the decrease of TEAC concentrations in plasma, the shortening of the bleeding time, and the thrombotic effect of DEP in pial cerebral venules. We conclude that pulmonary exposure to DEP cause oxidative stress responsible, at least partially, for the pulmonary and systemic inflammation and thrombotic events in the pial cerebral microvessels of mice. OTC pretreatment abrogated these effects through its ability to balance oxidant-antioxidant status.
Pregnancies complicated by asthma are associated with an increased risk of low birth weight. Currently, the mechanisms causing this outcome are unknown. To investigate whether impaired placental function may be a determinant, we measured placental 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11beta-HSD2) activity, protein and mRNA, placental CRH mRNA, fetal cortisol, and fetal estriol concentrations at delivery. Asthmatic subjects were classified according to inhaled glucocorticoid intake during pregnancy and compared with a control nonasthmatic group. There was a 25% reduction in neonatal birth weight centile in asthmatic women who did not use inhaled glucocorticoid treatment. This was accompanied by significantly reduced placental 11beta-HSD2 activity, significantly increased fetal cortisol, and a trend toward increased placental CRH mRNA and reduced fetal estriol concentrations. The use of inhaled glucocorticoids for treatment was associated with birth weight centile, 11beta-HSD2 activity, CRH mRNA, fetal cortisol, and estriol concentrations similar to control levels. There was a significant inverse correlation between fetal cortisol and fetal estriol concentrations across all groups. These studies demonstrate that inhaled glucocorticoid intake for the treatment of asthma is associated with improved placental function and fetal outcome, suggesting that inflammatory factors associated with asthma may be detrimental to fetal growth and development in these pregnancies.
Development of a comprehensive test battery is necesary for the evaluation and detection of aneugenic chemicals. The chromosome couting method was used in the present study. The aneugenic ability of cadmium choride (1.0, 2.0 and 4.0x10(-3) mM), cadmium sulfate (3. 3, 6.7x10(-5) and 1.3x10(-4) mM), potassium dichromate (2.5, 5. 0x10(-4) and 1.0x10(-3) mM) and cacodilic acid (1.25, 2.5 and 5. 0x10(-2) mM) were analysed using MRC-5 cells which have a modal diploid number of 2 n=46 with a spontaneous aneuploid or polyploid cells not higher than 13% and 8%, respectively.All compounds induced significant increments of aneuploid cells in relation to negative controls. The frequency of aneuploid cells increased in all treatments with cadmium chloride. Cadmium sulfate induced significant increments of aneuploid cells with the two higher doses. All the doses of potassium dichromate increased the frequency of aneuploid cells although to a lesser degree than the other compounds. In these cases, differences were in the borderline of statistical significance (p<0.05). Moreover, a low number of cells could be analysed in treatments with the highest dose due to the decrease in the mitotic index. Results obtained are coincident with previous reports using the same methodology in the sense that induced aneuploidy was mainly evidenced by the increase of hypodiploid but not hyperdiploid cells. In addition, anaphase-telophase analysis of the effects of the same doses of these metal compounds in CHO cells showed significant increments of lagging chromosomes and increased frequencies of kinetochore positive micronuclei in MRC-5 cells. These findings could be considered as an indication that the main cause of unequal chromosome separation is the failure of kinetochores to attach the spindle apparatus either by alteration of its protein components or by the altered chromatid separation in anaphase.
Melanoma patients with BRAF mutations respond to treatment with vemurafenib, thus creating a need for accurate testing of BRAF mutation status. We carried out a blinded study to evaluate various BRAF mutation testing methodologies in the clinical setting. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanoma samples were macrodissected before screening for mutations using Sanger sequencing, single-strand conformation analysis (SSCA), high resolution melting analysis (HRM) and competitive allele-specific TaqMan® PCR (CAST-PCR). Concordance of 100% was observed between the Sanger sequencing, SSCA and HRM techniques. CAST-PCR gave rapid and accurate results for the common V600E and V600K mutations, however additional assays are required to detect rarer BRAF mutation types found in 3-4% of melanomas. HRM and SSCA followed by Sanger sequencing are effective two-step strategies for the detection of BRAF mutations in the clinical setting. CAST-PCR was useful for samples with low tumour purity and may also be a cost-effective and robust method for routine diagnostics.
Resuscitation-induced intestinal edema is associated with early and profound mechanical changes in intestinal tissue. We hypothesize that the sodium hydrogen exchanger (NHE), a mechanoresponsive ion channel, is a mediator of edema-induced intestinal contractile dysfunction.
An animal model of hydrostatic intestinal edema was used for all experiments. NHE isoforms 1-3 mRNA and protein were evaluated. Subsequently, the effects of NHE inhibition (with 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride [EIPA]) on wet-to-dry ratios, signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, intestinal smooth muscle myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, intestinal contractile activity, and intestinal transit were measured.
NHE1-3 mRNA and protein levels were increased significantly in the small intestinal mucosa with the induction of intestinal edema. The administration of EIPA, an NHE inhibitor, attenuated validated markers of intestinal contractile dysfunction induced by edema as measured by decreased STAT-3 activation, increased MLC phosphorylation, improved intestinal contractile activity, and enhanced intestinal transit.
The mechanoresponsive ion channel NHE may mediate edema-induced intestinal contractile dysfunction, possibly via a STAT-3 related mechanism.
We report the case of a child with clinical and haematological features indicative of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML). The patient showed dysmorphic features: high forehead, bilateral epicanthal folds, long eyebrows, low nasal bridge and slightly low-set ears. A 38G>A (G13D) mutation in exon 1 of the NRAS gene was first demonstrated on peripheral blood cells, and then confirmed on granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units. The same mutation was also found in buccal swab, hair bulbs, endothelial cells, skin fibroblasts. This case suggests for the first time that constitutional mutations of NRAS may be responsible for development of a myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder in children.
The effects of indomethacin administration on hemodynamics were investigated in canine acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis (AHP). Thirteen mongrel dogs were randomly divided into a fluid treatment group, an indomethacin prophylaxis group (IMP), and an indomethacin therapy (IM) group. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg) was administered as a bolus dosage 30 min before the induction of AHP in the IMP group. In the IM group, indomethacin was also given as a bolus (5 mg/kg) in 5 min starting 30 min after the induction of AHP. AHP was induced with a mixture of trypsin and sodium taurocholate infused into the pancreatic duct. Hemodynamics were monitored during the 4.5 h of surveillance time. Heart rate did not change significantly between the groups. Indomethacin prophylaxis maintained mean arterial pressure at a significantly higher level (P less than 0.05) and prevented the initial fall in blood pressure when compared to the fluid treatment or IM group. Indomethacin increased cardiac output (P less than 0.05) in the IM group, but did not differ significantly in the IMP group in comparison with the fluid treatment group. In conclusion, the inhibition of the initial fall in blood pressure by indomethacin in AHP suggests prostaglandins to play a role in hemodynamic changes and pancreatic shock to be "septic" as evaluated by hemodynamic changes.
Women undergoing postoperative postpartum tubal ligation (PPTL) often experience considerable pain. We hypothesized that epidural morphine, as part of a multi-modal analgesic regimen, would decrease postoperative pain and the need for systemic analgesia after PPTL. In a double-blinded study, patients were randomized to receive epidural saline or morphine 2 mg, 3 mg, or 4 mg after epidural anesthesia for PPTL. Postoperatively, ibuprofen 600 mg was administered every 6 h and patients could request acetaminophen 325 mg/hydrocodone 10 mg. The primary outcome variable was time to first request for supplemental analgesia. Verbal rating scores for pain and the incidence and severity of side effects were recorded for 24 h. Morphine group subjects requested supplemental analgesia later and received fewer doses compared with the saline group subjects. Peak cramping and incisional verbal rating scores for pain and the area under the verbal rating scores for pain x time curve for cramping pain were less after epidural morphine compared with saline, but there were no differences among morphine groups. Nausea, vomiting, and pruritus occurred more often in all morphine groups and subjects who received morphine 4 mg required treatment for these side effects more frequently than the saline or morphine 2 mg groups. In conclusion, epidural morphine 2 mg as part of a multi-modal analgesic regimen improved analgesia and decreased the need for supplemental analgesics after PPTL. The need to treat side effects with morphine 2 mg was not increased compared to a regimen of oral acetaminophen/opioid/nonsteroidal antiinflammatory analgesics.
Nocturnal electrobioimpedance volumetric assessment (NEVA) is a procedure that can measure penile volume changes together with the number and duration of nocturnal erectile events. This study was conducted to evaluate the different NEVA patterns in diabetic patients with erectile dysfunction (ED), and demonstrate the extent to which tadalafil may affect the characteristics of nocturnal penile erections in these patients. Therefore, 38 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes and ED participated in this study. They were assessed with history intake including evaluation by the abridged five-item version of International Index of Erectile Function, clinical and psychiatric assessment and NEVA for three consecutive nights where placebo was given on the second night and tadalafil on the third night. In all, 14 potent males were taken as a control group. Data were analyzed using t-test. Results showed normal patterns in only six (16%) patients (central organic group), while abnormal patterns were observed in the remaining 32 (84%) patients (peripheral organic group). These abnormal patterns showed significant decrease in both the number (P=0.0001) and duration (P=0.03) of erectile events compared to those of controls. The percentage of penile blood volume change over baseline also decreased significantly (P=0.0002) relative to controls. Veno-occlusive dysfunction was the main pathology (23 patients, 72%) as suggested by NEVA. Tadalafil did not significantly change basal nocturnal penile tumescence results in either the central organic or control groups, but it did so significantly in the peripheral organic group (P=0.02 for duration change and P=0.01 for % blood volume change). In conclusion, NEVA may suggest some evidence about the pathophysiology of an underlying vasculogenic cause, thus directing towards the next specific step needed for a precise diagnosis. Tadalafil improves nocturnal erections in diabetic patients with peripheral but not central organic impotence.
Two patients who developed proteinuria while taking sulphasalazine are described. It is argued that the prevalence of this side-effect is such that tests for proteinuria should be included in the monitoring protocol for sulphasalazine.
