Veno-occlusive disease of the liver (VOD) is a potentially severe complication of high-dose cytoreductive therapy (HDT) used for stem cell transplantation (SCT). This complication is uncommon after HDT for autologous SCT (ASCT) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). The Spanish Myeloma Group/PETHEMA conducted a study (MM2000) for patients with newly diagnosed MM consisting of induction with alternating VBMCP/VBAD chemotherapy followed by intensification with busulfan/melphalan (Bu/MEL) with a second high-dose therapy procedure in patients not achieving at least near-complete remission with the first procedure. After 2 years of the trial, a number of episodes resembling classical VOD but with a late onset were recognized. Consequently, the protocol was modified, and Bu/MEL was replaced by melphalan 200 mg/m(2) (MEL-200). Three years later, after a total of 734 patients had undergone first autologous SCT, the incidence and characteristics of VOD episodes were analyzed in the whole series. Nineteen cases of VOD (8%) were observed among the first 240 patients receiving Bu/MEL, whereas only 2 (0.4%) were observed among the 494 patients treated with MEL-200 (P < .0001). VOD manifestations in the Bu/MEL group appeared at a median of 29 days (range, 3-57 days) after ASCT. Mortality directly attributable to VOD was 2% in the Bu/MEL group and 0.2% in the MEL-200 group (P = .026). This high incidence of severe VOD probably had a multifactorial origin (busulfan followed by melphalan and previous use of BCNU). This observation should be kept in mind when designing future trials for the treatment of MM.
The association between prenatal cocaine exposure and congenital anomalies is not definitive.
To determine whether prenatal cocaine exposure results in an increased number or identifiable pattern of abnormalities.
A prospective, longitudinal cohort enrolled between 1991 and 1993.
Rural public health population delivering at a regional tertiary medical center.
Two hundred seventy-two offspring of 154 prenatally identified crack/cocaine users and 154 nonusing controls were matched on race, parity, location of prenatal care (that related to level of pregnancy risk), and socioeconomic status. Drug use was determined through repeated in-depth histories and urine screens. Infants not examined within 7 days of birth were excluded.
Assessments were made by experienced examiners masked to maternal drug history. Included were 16 anthropometric measurements and a checklist of 180 physical features defined and agreed upon in advance.
There were no differences on major risk variables between the included and excluded infants. There were significantly more premature infants in the cocaine-exposed group. Cocaine-exposed infants were significantly smaller in birth weight, length, and head circumference but did not differ on remaining anthropometric measurements. There was no difference in type or number of abnormalities identified between the exposed and nonexposed groups. There was no relationship between amount or timing of exposure and any of the outcomes.
This prospective, large-scale, blinded, systematic evaluation for congenital anomalies in prenatally cocaine-exposed children did not identify an increased number or consistent pattern of abnormalities.
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) displays apoptogenic properties against various types of hematopoietic malignancies. We investigated the effects of As2O3 on the viability of the cutaneous T cell lymphoma cell lines HuT-78, SeAx, and Myla, and of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with Sézary syndrome, by using propidium iodide and annexin-V staining, terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL), cell cycle analysis, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi(m)) alterations, cytochrome c release, and detection of processed caspase-3. We also report in vivo effects of As2O3 in two patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The results show that As2O3 induces apoptosis of cutaneous T cell lymphoma lines and of Sézary cells from patients in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in vitro, as demonstrated by annexin-V staining, mitochondrial depolarization, and DNA fragmentation. Ascorbic acid 100 microM potentiated As2O3-induced Sézary cell death, whereas interferon-alpha had no synergistic effect. As2O3-induced Sézary cell death involves activation of caspase-3, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, and cytochrome c release, but was only partially inhibited by the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fluoromethylketone. Finally, As2O3 was administered to two patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, allowing us to obtain a partial response in one case, whereas stability was observed in the second patient. These results demonstrate that As2O3 synergizes with ascorbic acid to induce Sézary cell death at clinically achievable concentrations, through a caspase-partially independent pathway, and provide a rationale for further in vivo studies addressing the therapeutic efficacy of As2O3 in cutaneous T cell lymphoma patients.
It has been suggested that the altered iron metabolism in liver tumors, characterized by the iron-deficient phenotype, is of importance for tumor growth.
This study was performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying iron deficiency in liver tumors by examining how the liver tumor development affects the expression of iron metabolism-related genes.
Iron metabolism reference values were analyzed in the sera of diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular adenoma-bearing mice. Expression of iron metabolism-related genes was analyzed in adenomas and surrounding non-tumor tissues, and a subgroup of adenoma-bearing mice loaded with iron 72h before sacrifice.
Iron content of the adenoma tissues was 2.0-2.5-fold lower compared to surrounding and age-matched control tissues. There was no significant difference in serum iron levels between the adenoma-bearing and control mice, while the adenoma-bearing mice exhibited a 2.4-fold lower level of serum transferrin saturation. Expression of iron metabolism-related genes was dysregulated in the adenomas. Iron loading affected protein expression similarly in the adenomas and surrounding tissues suggesting that iron-responsive regulation of the proteins was not impaired. However, the mRNA expression for ceruloplasmin and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) IRE(+) in the adenomas was altered independently of iron status, and the dysregulation may contribute to diminished iron content.
These findings suggest that diethylnitrosamine-induced liver adenoma-bearing mice have abnormal iron metabolism and that dysregulation of iron metabolism-related genes contributes to iron deficiency in the adenomas.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a stress-inducible gas generated by heme oxygenase (HO) eliciting adaptive responses against toxicants; however, mechanisms for its reception remain unknown. Serendipitous observation in metabolome analysis in CO-overproducing livers suggested roles of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) that rate-limits transsulfuration pathway and H(2)S generation, for the gas-responsive receptor. Studies using recombinant CBS indicated that CO binds to the prosthetic heme, stabilizing 6-coordinated CO-Fe(II)-histidine complex to block the activity, whereas nitric oxide (NO) forms 5-coordinated structure without inhibiting it. The CO-overproducing livers down-regulated H(2)S to stimulate HCO(3) (-)-dependent choleresis: these responses were attenuated by blocking HO or by donating H(2)S. Livers of heterozygous CBS knockout mice neither down-regulated H(2)S nor exhibited the choleresis while overproducing CO. In the mouse model of estradiol-induced cholestasis, CO overproduction by inducing HO-1 significantly improved the bile output through stimulating HCO(3) (-) excretion; such a choleretic response did not occur in the knockout mice.
Results collected from metabolome analyses suggested that CBS serves as a CO-sensitive modulator of H(2)S to support biliary excretion, shedding light on a putative role of the enzyme for stress-elicited adaptive response against bile-dependent detoxification processes.
Effect of organoselenium compound (selol), on antinociceptive action of opioid agonists in vincristine neuropathic pain model was investigated.
The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli--the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall-Selitto.
Daily administration of VIN (70 microg/kg, iv) resulted in progressive decrease of pain threshold. Neither morphine, fentanyl nor buprenorphine administered alone in 5 consecutive days modified the vincristine-induced hyperalgesia, whereas selol slightly increased the nociceptive threshold. Co-administration of selol with opioids markedly enhanced the analgesic activity of all three investigated compounds.
Therefore, concomitant administration of selenium and opioids may be beneficial in terminal neoplastic states.
Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) exhibit endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance. Reciprocal relationships between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance may contribute to hypertension by causing imbalanced regulation of endothelial-derived vasodilators (e.g., nitric oxide) and vasoconstrictors (e.g., endothelin-1 [ET-1]). Treatment of SHRs with rosiglitazone (insulin sensitizer) and/or enalapril (ACE inhibitor) may simultaneously improve hypertension, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction by rebalancing insulin-stimulated production of vasoactive mediators. When compared with WKY control rats, 12-week-old vehicle-treated SHRs were hypertensive, overweight, and insulin resistant, with elevated fasting levels of insulin and ET-1 and reduced serum adiponectin levels. In mesenteric vascular beds (MVBs) isolated from vehicle-treated SHRs and preconstricted with norepinephrine (NE) ex vivo, vasodilator responses to insulin were significantly impaired, whereas the ability of insulin to oppose vasoconstrictor actions of NE was absent (versus WKY controls). Three-week treatment of SHRs with rosiglitazone and/or enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure, insulin resistance, fasting insulin, and ET-1 levels and increased adiponectin levels to values comparable with those observed in vehicle-treated WKY controls. By restoring phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent effects, rosiglitazone and/or enalapril therapy of SHRs also significantly improved vasodilator responses to insulin in MVB preconstricted with NE ex vivo. Taken together, our data provide strong support for the existence of reciprocal relationships between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance that may be relevant for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the metabolic syndrome.
Clearance experiments were conducted with metabolic cages to determine the effect of dietary magnesium on gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Three groups of male Wistar rats were given low, medium- or high-magnesium diets. Following baseline clearances, gentamicin was administered by intramuscular injection (20 mg/kg). Additional clearances were performed 6 and 11 days after gentamicin administration. 24-hour clearances were also taken 8 days after gentamicin withdrawal. The present experiments demonstrated that high magnesium intake protected the kidney against injury induced by gentamicin. This reduction in nephrotoxicity was probably due to competition of binding between magnesium and gentamicin to the renal membrane. Histological examinations were also done in these animals. The results showed that the most severe changes were seen in rats receiving a low-magnesium diet. Rats given a high-magnesium diet showed the least toxic changes while rats receiving a medium-magnesium diet showed changes of intermediate severity. These observations complemented the results obtained from 24-hour clearances and indicate the protective effect of dietary magnesium on the development of acute renal failure following administration of gentamicin.
One case of Phenindione (PID) adverse reaction is reported. The patient showed a typical picture of immunological reaction to the drug. In spite of severe bacteremia, she recovered. Only 33 cases of PID intolerance are reported in the literature. In all these patients, renal failure occurred. Superinfection is the most frequent cause of death. PID adverse reaction should be evoqued in the presence of signs such a fever, asthenia, anorexia and cutaneous reaction. The PID should be stopped immediatly but renal failure yet develops. During a PID treatment, frequent evaluation of blood azotemia, creatinine and proteinuria should be performed.
Down-regulation of RECK, an important metastasis suppressor gene, has been found in human colon cancer. However, the molecular mechanism for this down- regulation and its biological significance are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether down-regulation of RECK is caused by epigenetic inactivation via promoter methylation and tested the effect of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor on RECK expression and cell invasion. The mRNA and protein levels of RECK in colon tumor tissues and their normal counterparts were compared. We found that down-regulation of RECK was found in 48% of the twenty five tumors analyzed. MSP analysis demonstrated that methylation of RECK promoter was detected in 44% (11/25) of the tumor tissues and a strong correlation between down-regulation and promoter methylation was found (P = 0.028). Promoter methylation was also found in SW480 and SW620 human colon cancer cell lines. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5'-azacytidine reversed promoter methylation, restored RECK expression and suppressed invasion by these two cell lines. Restoration of RECK is critical for 5'-azacytidine-mediated suppression of cell invasion because inhibition of RECK by a specific antibody significantly attenuated the anti-invasive ability of 5'-azacytidine. Taken together, our results suggest that down-regulation of the metastasis suppressor RECK in colon cancer is associated with promoter methylation and that a DNMT inhibitor may restore RECK expression to inhibit cell invasion.
Left ventricular (LV) remodeling, including cardiomyocyte necrosis, scar formation, LV geometric changes, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, contributes to cardiac dysfunction and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). Although precise cellular signaling mechanisms for LV remodeling are not fully elucidated, G(q) protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, including diacylglycerol (DAG) and PKC, are involved in this process. DAG kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DAG and controls cellular DAG levels, thus acting as a negative regulator of PKC and subsequent cellular signaling. We previously reported that DGK inhibited angiotensin II and phenylephrine-induced activation of the DAG-PKC signaling and subsequent cardiac hypertrophy. The purpose of this study was to examine whether DGK modifies LV remodeling after MI. Left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated in transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of DGKzeta (DGKzeta-TG) and wild-type (WT) mice. LV chamber dilatation (4.12 +/- 0.10 vs. 4.53 +/- 0.32 mm, P < 0.01), reduction of LV systolic function (34.8 +/- 8.3% vs. 28.3 +/- 4.8%, P < 0.01), and increases in LV weight (95 +/- 3.6 vs. 111 +/- 4.1 mg, P < 0.05) and lung weight (160 +/- 15 vs. 221 +/- 25 mg, P < 0.05) at 4 wk after MI were attenuated in DGKzeta-TG mice compared with WT mice. In the noninfarct area, fibrosis fraction (0.51 +/- 0.04, P < 0.01) and upregulation of profibrotic genes, such as transforming growth factor-beta1 (P < 0.01), collagen type I (P < 0.05), and collagen type III (P < 0.01), were blocked in DGKzeta-TG mice. The survival rate at 4 wk after MI was higher in DGKzeta-TG mice than in WT mice (61% vs. 37%, P < 0.01). In conclusion, these results demonstrate the first evidence that DGKzeta suppresses LV structural remodeling and fibrosis and improves survival after MI. DGKzeta may be a potential novel therapeutic target to prevent LV remodeling after MI.
Female acute uncomplicated cystitis responds relatively well to antimicrobial chemotherapy, but this is also a disease which shows a high frequency of recurrence. However, there have been no published reports regarding long-term monitoring of the course of this disease after therapy has been administered. Accordingly, using primarily a questionnaire, the authors carried out long-term monitoring (for a mean of 242 days) of the natural course of cases of female acute uncomplicated cystitis after single-dose therapy with lomefloxacin (LFLX), a new quinolone antimicrobial agent. The subjects of this study were female patients diagnosed as having acute uncomplicated cystitis with pain upon urination, pyuria (> or = 10 WBCs/hpf) and bacteriuria (> or = 10(4) cfu/ml). LFLX was orally administered as a single dose of 100 mg or 300 mg, and the therapeutic efficacy was evaluated on the 3rd and 7th days thereafter. In principle, the evaluation of cure was performed on the 7th day after LFLX administration, and monitoring was conducted to detect early recurrence during the next 7 days (i.e., through the 14th day after treatment). Then the subjects were monitored for late recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 242 days by means of a questionnaire. Confirmation of recurrence was carried out to the greatest extent possible. It was possible to carry out long-term monitoring of the natural course of 101 cases of female acute uncomplicated cystitis in which the clinical efficacy on the 3rd day after LFLX treatment had been evaluated as good or excellent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Adrenal androgens activate the androgen receptor and stimulate prostate cancer growth. Ketoconazole is used as an inhibitor of adrenal androgen synthesis in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer. This study analyzes the relationship between pretreatment androgen levels and outcome following ketoconazole treatment.
Baseline levels of three adrenal androgens (androstenedione, dehydroepiandrostenedione, and dehydroepiandrostenedione-sulfate) and testosterone were measured. Regression models (logistic and proportional hazard) were used to assess the prognostic significance of these levels in predicting overall survival and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response defined by Consensus Criteria.
In 103 patients with available levels, PSA response rate was 28% and median response duration was 4.8 months. The median baseline androstenedione level was 0.64 ng/mL and was 0.88 ng/mL versus 0.53 ng/mL for those with and without a PSA response, respectively (P = 0.034). In univariate analysis, elevation of baseline androstenedione levels was predictive of PSA response [odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.03-4.96; P = 0.043]. In multivariate analysis, both the uppermost and the middle tertile of baseline androstenedione level were associated with an improved overall survival compared with those in the lower tertile (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.98; P = 0.40; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.90; P = 0.018, respectively). A linear correlation was observed among all androgen levels.
Higher androstenedione levels predict likelihood of response to ketoconazole and improved survival compared with patients with lower levels. These data suggest that therapy with ketoconazole is less effective in patients with low levels of androgen at baseline.
Organoselenides have been documented as promising pharmacological agents against a number of diseases associated with oxidative stress. Here we have investigated, for the first time, the potential antioxidant activity of binaphthyl diselenide ((NapSe)(2); 50 mg kg(-1), p.o.) against the 2-nitropropane (2-NP)-induced hepatoxicity in rats, using different end points of toxicity (liver histopathology, plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine). In addition, in view of the association of oxidative stress with 2-NP exposure, hepatic lipid peroxidation, ascorbic acid levels, delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (delta-ALA-D) and catalase (CAT) activities were evaluated. 2-NP caused an increase of AST, ALT and hepatic lipid peroxidation. 2-NP also caused hepatic histopathological alterations and delta-ALA-D inhibition. (NapSe)(2) (50 mg kg(-1)) prevented 2-NP-induced changes in plasmatic ALT and AST activities and also prevented changes in hepatic histology, delta-ALA-D and lipid peroxidation. Results presented here indicate that the protective mechanism of (NapSe)(2) against 2-NP hepatotoxicity is possibly linked to its antioxidant activity.
To observe the symptoms similar to schizophrenia in mice after ketamine single or continuous injection and to evaluate the feasibility of schizophrenia model injected with different dose of ketamine.
A total of 40 male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups, which were injected intraperitoneally with physiological saline (control group), 25 mg/kg ketamine (low dose group), 50 mg/kg ketamine (middle dose group), and 100 mg/kg ketamine (high dose group) qd for 7 days continuously. The behavior changes of mice were observed.
Hyperactivity, stereotyped behavior and ataxia (P < 0.01) were observed in high dose group after single injection. After continuous injection of ketamine for 7 days, the middle dose group showed hyperactivity, stereotyped behavior and ataxia (P < 0.05), stereotyped behavior and ataxia were more significant in high dose group (P < 0.01).
Ketamine can induce the symptoms similar to schizophrenia in mice after single or continuous injection. The symptoms induced by high dose ketamine will be more prominent and stable after continuous injection.
Aspiration of acid to the airway causes airway inflammation, and acid stress to the airway caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been known as a potential mechanism of deteriorated asthma symptoms. However, the efficacy of the acid suppressive drugs, H(2)-receptor blockers (H(2) blocker) and proton pump inhibitors, on asthma symptoms and pulmonary functions remains controversial. We therefore designed the randomized prospective study to determine the efficacy of an H(2) blocker (roxatidine, 150 mg/day) and a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole, 30 mg/day) on asthma symptoms of 30 asthmatic patients with GERD. These patients were divided in the two groups (15 patients for each group) and treated with either roxatidine or lansoprazole. The diagnosis of GERD was established by the method of Los Angeles classification including mucosal minimum change of Grade M and questionnaire for the diagnosis of reflux disease (QUEST) score. The efficacy of acid suppressive drugs was evaluated by peak expiratory flow (PEF), asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) that evaluates the improvement of asthma symptoms, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1.0)). Lansoprazole, but not roxatidine, significantly improved PEF and ACQ scores (p < 0.05) with the improved QUEST scores. However, these acid suppressive drugs did not change the pulmonary function of FEV(1.0) in asthmatic patients. In conclusion, treatment with a proton pump inhibitor, lansoprazole, appears to be useful in improvement of asthma symptoms in asthmatic patients with GERD.
The occurrence of muscular pathologies in AZT treated subjects has been evaluated in 67 HIV seropositive outpatients (56 AZT-treated and 11 untreated controls) in a neurological clinical and paraclinical follow-up study. Standard electromyographic and electrodiagnostic examinations, together with muscle enzyme determination, were performed in every subject, and periodically repeated at fixed intervals; in 11 patients a muscle biopsy sample was also obtained. An AZT-related myopathy was diagnosed in 8 biopsied cases; 9 more patients were considered to have AZT myopathy on clinical, EMG and ex juvantibus criteria. Statistical analysis showed that treatment duration was more relevant to the development of the myopathy than AZT dosage, though an individual predisposition could not be excluded, at least in a small number of cases. The risk of developing a toxic myopathy will therefore have to be considered when evaluating long-term effects of AZT therapy.
A combination of tobramycin sulfate and cefamandole nafate was used as initial empiric therapy for the treatment of 71 evaluable febrile (temperature greater than 38.5 degrees C) episodes in 64 (neutrophils, less than 1,000/microL) adult patients with cancer and granulocytopenia. Carbenicillin sodium or ticarcillin disodium was substituted for cefamandole in patients with Pseudomonas infections and in patients in whom the initial regimen was unsuccessful. Twenty-nine episodes were randomized to receive tobramycin by continuous infusion, while 42 were randomized to receive tobramycin by interrupted infusion. Twenty-seven (79%) of the 34 documented infections responded to the initial empiric antibiotic combination, ten (83%) of 12 being given continuous infusion and 17 (77%) of 22 being given interrupted infusion of tobramycin. Nephrotoxic reaction occurred in 7% of patients treated with continuous infusion and 15% treated with interrupted infusion, mostly patients older than 60 years. Tobramycin, by either continuous or interrupted infusion, plus cefamandole is safe and efficacious empiric therapy for infections in patients with cancer and granulocytopenia.
Isoproterenol (ISPH) induced myocardial infarction was confirmed by disturbances in serum and heart tissue marker enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phospho kinase (CPK), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), increased level of lipid peroxidation and histopathological changes in the heart of ISPH administered rats. Pretreatment with mangiferin (10 mg/100 g body weight) for 28 days was found to ameliorate the effect of ISPH-induced pathological changes, reduced the lipid peroxide formation and retained the myocardial marker enzyme activities at near normal level. The above results indicate the cardioprotective effect of mangiferin against ISPH-induced myocardial infarction in rats.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used in adult stem cell-based gene therapy for vascular diseases. To test the hypothesis that MSCs alone or endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-modified MSCs can be used for treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), syngeneic rat MSCs (rMSCs) were isolated, ex vivo expanded, transduced with adenovirus containing eNOS, and injected into the penis of aged rats. Histological analysis demonstrated that rMSCs survived for at least 21 days in corporal tissue after intracavernous injection, and an inflammatory response was not induced. Intracavernous administration of eNOS-modified rMSCs improved the erectile response in aged rats at 7 and 21 days after injection. The increase in erectile function was associated with increased eNOS protein, NOS activity, and cGMP levels. rMSCs alone increased erectile function of aged rats at day 21, but not at day 7, with the transplanted cells exhibiting positive immunostaining for several endothelial and smooth muscle cell markers. This change in rMSC phenotype was accompanied by upregulation of penile eNOS protein expression/activity and elevated cGMP levels. These findings demonstrate that an adenovirus can be used to transduce ex vivo expanded rMSCs to express eNOS and that eNOS-modified rMSCs improve erectile function in the aged rat. Intracavernous injection of unmodified wildtype rMSCs improved erectile function 21 days after injection through mechanisms involving improved endothelium-derived NO/cGMP signaling and rMSC differentiation into penile cells expressing endothelial and smooth muscle markers. These data highlight the potential clinical use of adult stem cell-based therapy for the treatment of ED.
Withdrawal from repeated cocaine is associated with increased synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression in nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons and enhanced behavioral sensitivity to AMPAR stimulation. Recent studies found that increased membrane expression of AMPARs is reversed or normalized on cocaine reexposure in withdrawal, but the mechanism for this AMPAR plasticity and the behavioral implications are unknown. Here, we examine the effects of renewed cocaine exposure during withdrawal on enhanced NAc AMPAR sensitivity and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Cocaine reexposure transiently reversed enhanced NAc AMPAR-mediated locomotion 1 d later, while enhancing cocaine-induced locomotion. Reversal in AMPAR sensitivity was prohibited by NAc AMPAR blockade with CNQX during cocaine reexposure and mimicked by intra-NAc infusions of AMPA, suggesting that cocaine-induced glutamate stimulation of NAc AMPARs is necessary for reversing AMPAR responsiveness. Similarly, systemic treatment with the dopamine D(1)-like agonist SKF 81297 [(+/-)-6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-l-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrobromide] reversed AMPAR responsiveness in cocaine withdrawal, but the effect was prevented by local NAc AMPAR blockade in the NAc, and not local D(1)-like receptor blockade, suggesting a role for glutamate afferents in the reversal of enhanced AMPAR sensitivity. Together, these findings suggest that cocaine-induced glutamate release in sensitized animals is responsible for dynamic alterations in AMPAR function that contribute to enhanced cocaine sensitivity.
Often fatal, acute lung injury has a complicated etiology. Previous studies from our laboratory in mice have demonstrated that survival during acute lung injury is a complex trait governed by multiple loci. We also found that the increase in metallothionein (MT) is one of the greatest noted in transcriptome-wide analyses of gene expression. To assess the role of MT in nickel-induced acute lung injury, the survival of Mt-transgenic, Mt1/2(+/+), and Mt1/2(-/-) mice was compared. Pulmonary inflammation and global gene expression were compared in Mt1/2(+/+) and Mt1/2(-/-) mice. Gene-targeted Mt1/2(-/-) mice were more susceptible than Mt1/2(+/+) mice to nickel-induced inflammation, surfactant-associated protein B transcript loss, and lethality. Similarly, Mt-transgenic mice exhibited increased survival. MAPPFinder analyses also noted significant decreases in genes involved in protein processing (e.g., ubiquitination, folding), which were greater in Mt1/2(-/-) mice as compared with Mt1/2(+/+) mice early in the progression of acute lung injury, possibly due to a zinc-mediated transcript destabilization. In contrast, transcript levels of genes associated with the inflammatory response, extracellular matrix regulation, and coagulation/fibrinolysis were increased more in Mt1/2(-/-) mice as compared with Mt1/2(+/+) mice late in the development of acute lung injury. Thus, MT ultimately improves survival in the progression of acute lung injury in mice. Transcriptome-wide analysis suggests that this survival may be mediated through changes in the destabilization of transcripts associated with protein processing, the subsequent augmentation of transcripts controlling inflammation, extracellular matrix regulation, coagulation/fibrinolysis, and disruption of surfactant homeostasis.
