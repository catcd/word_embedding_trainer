The main constraints on the administration of aminoglycosides are the risks of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, which can lead to acute, renal, vestibular, and auditory toxicities. In the present study we focused on nephrotoxicity. No reliable predictor of nephrotoxicity has been found to date. We have developed a deterministic model which describes the pharmacokinetic behavior of aminoglycosides (with a two-compartment model), the kinetics of aminoglycoside accumulation in the renal cortex, the effects of aminoglycosides on renal cells, the resulting effects on renal function by tubuloglomerular feedback, and the resulting effects on serum creatinine concentrations. The pharmacokinetic parameter values were estimated by use of the NPEM program. The estimated pharmacodynamic parameter values were obtained after minimization of the least-squares objective function between the measured and the calculated serum creatinine concentrations. A simulation program assessed the influences of the dosage regimens on the occurrence of nephrotoxicity. We have also demonstrated the relevancy of modeling of the circadian rhythm of the renal function. We have shown the ability of the model to fit with 49 observed serum creatinine concentrations for a group of eight patients treated for endocarditis by comparison with 49 calculated serum creatinine concentrations (r(2) = 0.988; P < 0.001). We have found that for the same daily dose, the nephrotoxicity observed with a thrice-daily administration schedule appears more rapidly, induces a greater decrease in renal function, and is more prolonged than those that occur with less frequent administration schedules (for example, once-daily administration). Moreover, for once-daily administration, we have demonstrated that the time of day of administration can influence the incidence of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. The lowest level of nephrotoxicity was observed when aminoglycosides were administered at 1:30 p.m. Clinical application of this model might make it possible to adjust aminoglycoside dosage regimens by taking into account both the efficacies and toxicities of the drugs.
The administration of methylergonovine maleate to a patient at term is rare. A patient received the drug at 36 weeks' gestation, with subsequent development of fetal distress secondary to uterine tetany. Treatment with terbutaline and magnesium sulfate was unsuccessful in alleviating the uterine hypertonus, necessitating cesarean section.
A recent clinical advance has been the discovery that many drug-induced hepatic diseases result from the metabolic activation of chemically stable drugs to potent alkylating agents by the liver. In addition to the liver, however, the kidney also contains active enzyme systems capable of metabolically activating drugs and other chemicals. For this reason a systematic investigation of the possible role of metabolic activation in the pathogenesis of several drug-induced renal diseases has been undertaken. These laboratory results are reviewed in the light of the clinical spectrum of the renal injuries, and possible therapeutic implications of these new findings are briefly discussed. The potential use of these models of nephrotoxicity to probe a variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms of renal function are noted.
The effects of prolonged treatment with the antagonistic analog of LH-RH (N-Ac-D-p-Cl-Phe1,2, D-Trp3,D-Arg6,D-Ala10) LH-RH (ORG 30276) on the hyperprolactinemia induced by haloperidol were investigated in intact or ovariectomized female rats. Treatment with ORG 30276 for 20 days significantly reduced prolactin levels elevated by daily injections of haloperidol in intact as well as in ovariectomized rats. Administration of ORG 30276 also significantly decreased serum LH levels in both types of rats. It is concluded that the LH-RH antagonist ORG 30276 is able to counteract the hyperprolactinemic effect of haloperidol. This effect might be due to a blockade of the action of endogenous LH-RH on the gonadotrophs, which results in a suppressing of the paracrine action of these cells on the lactotroph.
Four hundred and thirty six pupils in two primary schools in Kibwezi, Kenya aged between seven and sixteen years and positive for S. mansoni were treated as follows: 320 pupils with a single dose of praziquantel at 40 mg/kg body weight and 116 controls with a placebo. Immediate and delayed side effects of praziquantel were observed. The main side-effects were abdominal pain (36.3%), headache (35.3%) and nausea (13.1%). There was correlation between frequencies of these side-effects and intensity of infection measured as eggs per gram of faeces. Other side-effects included dizziness (9.7%), fever (7.8%), urticaria and bloody diarrhoea. Overall, the side-effects of praziquantel were mild and transient, and did not require any intervention. For ethical reasons, all pupils who served as controls were treated with praziquantel after the study.
Genetic factors may play a role in susceptibility to stroke. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is a candidate gene for two phenotypically different types of stroke affecting small perforating arteries: spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SIH) and ischemic stroke due to small vessel disease (SVD). The authors report evidence that ACE gene DD homozygosity of the I/D polymorphism in intron 16 is an independent risk factor for SIH, and not for SVD stroke, in a Polish population.
Propofol, a popular intravenous (iv) anaesthetic induction agent for brief cases or day surgery, is associated with smooth induction, pleasant sleep, rapid recovery and little postoperative nausea. A major disadvantage is pain at the site of injection. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of simultaneous iv infusion of carrier fluid on propofol-induced local pain.
Thirty patients, scheduled for ear-nose-throat or plastic surgery under general anaesthesia, were randomly allocated into two groups. Each patient had two 2 ml iv bolus injections of propofol given at two minutes' interval. In group I (n=15) the first bolus injection was given with no iv carrier fluid and the second one given with a 10 ml iv carrier fluid infused over 10 s. Correspondingly, the patients in group II (n=15) had their first injection with and their second one without the iv carrier fluid. Following each injection of propofol the patients were asked by a blinded investigator to score their pain on a 10-point visual analogue scale, and to report the appearance, maximum and disappearance of pain. After the second assessment of pain, general anaesthesia was induced with more propofol.
Pain intensity at the site of propofol injection was found not to be influenced by simultaneous iv infusion of carrier fluid.
It seems, from the results obtained here, that simultaneous iv infusion of carrier fluid has no particular effect on local pain following iv administration of propofol.
Acyclovir nephrotoxicity has been described since the inception of the drug's use more than a decade ago. Acute renal failure mediated by this compound is characterized by abrupt elevations in serum creatinine and a gradual return to baseline renal function on discontinuation of the drug. Drug crystal formation in collecting tubules resulting in an intraparenchymal form of obstructive nephropathy has been suggested as the mechanism for acyclovir nephrotoxicity. The patient we present developed rapidly progressive acute renal failure with concomitant mental status changes in the setting of treatment with high-dose parenteral acyclovir. Acyclovir therapy was discontinued and an open renal biopsy was obtained to further evaluate our patient's diminishing renal function. Pathologic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed loss of proximal tubule brush border and dilated proximal and distal tubules with flattening of lining cells and focal nuclear loss. No crystals were noted. These changes were consistent with acute tubular necrosis with regeneration. Over the next 4 days our patient's renal and neurologic levels recovered to their prehospitalization statuses. It appears that our patient was affected by acyclovir-mediated nephrotoxicity that manifested on biopsy by acute tubular necrosis and the absence of crystalluria or crystal deposition. Intravenous acyclovir treatment can therefore produce rapidly progressive acute neurologic and renal toxicity that is usually reversible. The pathologic changes of acute tubular necrosis must now be included as part of the spectrum of renal damage associated with acyclovir therapy.
Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is an essential coenzyme for glutathione reductase (GR) which catalyzes the reduction of oxidized glutathione to regenerate the reduced form involved in protection against oxidative stress. Riboflavin kinase (RFK) also known as flavokinase is involved in the first step of bioactivation of riboflavin (RF) to form flavin mononucleotide (FMN) which can be subsequently converted to FAD in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by FAD synthetase (FADS). We investigated the involvement of RFK in cisplatin resistance using human prostate cancer PC3 cells. RFK overexpression renders cells resistant not only to cisplatin but also to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and diamide. Furthermore, knockdown of RFK expression induced apoptosis. We demonstrated that overexpression of RFK increased the levels of FAD, FMN and total glutathione and the expression of GR and glutathione S-transferase-π (GSTπ). RFK expression is up-regulated in cisplatin-resistant P/CDP6 cells in addition to FAD, total glutathione level, GR and GSTπ. Knockdown of RFK expression also sensitized both PC3 and P/CDP6 cells to cisplatin. Moreover, cellular levels of RFK expression correlate well with Gleason score, known as a good indicator of patient prognosis. The present study suggests that RFK expression is involved not only in cellular protection from oxidative stress but also in malignant progression of prostate cancer.
A relatively simple and rapid method has been developed to induce tolerance to and dependence on alcohol in mice. Alternating intraperitoneal injections of metabolically stable tert-butanol and ethanol for 4 consecutive days resulted in a physical dependence on alcohol, which was quantified by the latency and ED50 of picrotoxin-induced CNS hyperexcitability--myoclonic and tonic seizures and mortality--during the withdrawal period. The data indicate that alcohol-dependent animals in the withdrawal period are more susceptible than alcohol-naive controls to picrotoxin. Withdrawal hyperexcitability can be quantified by the ED50 of picrotoxin.
To investigate the effects of topical beta-blocker eyedrops on nocturnal arterial hypotension and heart rate and on visual field deterioration.
We prospectively investigated 275 white patients, 161 with glaucomatous optic neuropathy and 114 with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and diurnal curve of intraocular pressure, in addition to detailed ophthalmic evaluation. Of the patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy, 131 had normal-tension glaucoma and 30 had primary open-angle glaucoma. Of the 275 patients, 114 were using topical beta-blocker eyedrops twice daily (76 with normal-tension glaucoma, 26 with primary open-angle glaucoma, and 12 with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy).
Hourly average blood pressure data analyses showed overall a drop in blood pressure as well as heart rate during sleep, and a significantly greater drop in mean diastolic blood pressure (P = .009) at night in normal-tension glaucoma than in anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Also, patients using beta-blocker eyedrops experienced a significantly greater percentage drop in diastolic blood pressure at night (P = .028), lower minimum nighttime diastolic blood pressure (P = .072), and lower minimum nighttime heart rate (P = .002) than did those not using them. In normal-tension glaucoma, eyes receiving beta-blocker eyedrops showed visual field progression significantly (P = .0003) more often than those not receiving beta-blockers.
The findings of our studies, as well as those of others, suggest that any factor that increases nocturnal arterial hypotension is a potential risk factor in vulnerable individuals with glaucomatous optic neuropathy or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The present study suggests that the use of beta-blocker eyedrops, by aggravating nocturnal arterial hypotension and reducing the heart rate, may be a potential risk factor in susceptible individuals.
Cadmium is categorized as a human carcinogen especially involved in lung cancers. Angiogenesis is considered a fundamental requirement for tumorigenesis, but the mechanisms underlying the tumor angiogenesis induced by cadmium are poorly understood. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we investigated the angiogenic mechanisms of cadmium in human bronchial epithelial cells and tumor formation. Our results demonstrated that cadmium (CdCl(2)) activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and AKT signaling and elevated the expression of a key downstream proangiogenic molecule hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in immortalized human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Cadmium also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which could be inhibited by ROS scavengers, catalase and diphenyleneiodonium chloride. Inhibition of ROS generation also attenuated ERK, AKT, p70S6K1 activation, and HIF-1α expression. Similar results were obtained in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, showing that cadmium induced HIF-1 expression via ROS/ERK/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, cadmium induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression and transcriptional activation through ROS, ERK, and AKT pathways. Finally, cadmium transformed human bronchial epithelial cells in culture; the transformed cells induced tube formation in vitro, angiogenesis on chicken chorioallantoic membrane, and formed tumors in nude mice. Taken together, the results of this study provide explanation for the role and molecular mechanisms of cadmium in promoting angiogenesis in lung epithelial cells and malignant transformation and will be helpful for improved occupational protection, prevention, as well as chemotherapy of human lung cancers caused by heavy metal cadmium.
Amiodarone [2-butyl-3-(3',5'-diiodo-4'α-diethylaminoethoxybenzoyl)-benzofuran] (AMD), a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is known to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxic reactions in human patients. One hypothesis for the etiology of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions is that a concurrent inflammatory stress results in decreased threshold for drug toxicity. To explore this hypothesis in an animal model, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with nonhepatotoxic doses of AMD or its vehicle and with saline vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce low-level inflammation. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities as well as increased total bile acid concentrations in serum and midzonal hepatocellular necrosis were observed only in AMD/LPS-cotreated rats. The time interval between AMD and LPS administration was critical: AMD injected 16 h before LPS led to liver injury, whereas AMD injected 2-12 h before LPS failed to cause this response. The increase in ALT activity in AMD/LPS cotreatment showed a clear dose-response relationship with AMD as well as LPS. The metabolism and hepatic accumulation of AMD were not affected by LPS coexposure. Serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) was significantly increased by LPS and was slightly prolonged by AMD. In Hepac1c7 cells, addition of TNF potentiated the cytotoxicity of both AMD and its primary metabolite, mono-N-desethylamiodarone. In vivo inhibition of TNF signaling by etanercept attenuated the AMD/LPS-induced liver injury in rats. In summary, AMD treatment during modest inflammation induced severe hepatotoxicity in rats, and TNF contributed to the induction of liver injury in this animal model of idiosyncratic AMD-induced liver injury.
In this study we analyzed some aspects of the assessment of developmental delay in the zebrafish embryotoxicity/teratogenicity test and explored the suitability of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as a biochemical marker and as a higher throughput alternative to morphological endpoints such as head-trunk angle, tail length and morphological score. Embryos were exposed from 4 to 52 h post-fertilization (hpf) to a selection of known embryotoxic/teratogen compounds (valproic acid, retinoic acid, caffeine, sodium salicylate, glucose, hydroxyurea, methoxyacetic acid, boric acid and paraoxon-methyl) over a concentration range. They were evaluated for AChE activity, head-trunk angle, tail length and several qualitative parameters integrated in a morphological score. In general, the different patterns of the concentration-response curves allowed distinguishing between chemicals that produced growth retardation (valproic and methoxyacetic acid) and chemicals that produced non-growth-delay related malformations. An acceptable correlation between the morphological score, AChE activity and head-trunk angle as markers of developmental delay was observed, being AChE activity particularly sensitive to detect delay in the absence of malformations.
Previous studies have demonstrated that benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) may disrupt the development of key biological systems, thus leaving children more vulnerable to functional impairments in adulthood. The current study was conducted to determine whether neurotoxic effects of postnatal BaP exposure on behavioral performance persist in juvenile and young adult stages. Therefore, neonate Sprague-Dawley pups were given oral doses of BaP (0.02, 0.2, and 2 mg/kg/day) continuing through a period of rapid brain development (on postnatal days [PNDs] 5-11). Further, developmental milestones and behavioral endpoints assessing sensory and motor maturation were examined. Also, in this study, Morris water maze and elevated plus maze were used for evaluating the cognitive function and anxiety-like behavior. Our results showed that there was altered ontogeny in a few measures of neuromotor development; however, other developmental milestones and sensory responses were not altered significantly. Moreover, the locomotor activity deficit in BaP-treated pups was evident at PND 36 and was most pronounced in the PND 69. Also, exposure to BaP during early postnatal development had an adverse effect on adult rats (PND 70) in the elevated plus maze, and the swim maze suggests that low doses of BaP impair spatial learning functions at adult test period. In contrast, BaP exposure had no evident effect on behaviors in these two mazes for adolescent animals. These data clearly indicate that behavioral impairments resulting from postnatal BaP exposure are potentially long-lasting and may not be apparent in juveniles, but are present in young adulthood.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of adding sufentanil 10 micrograms, fentanyl 10 micrograms or a control of 1 mL saline to 2.5 mg bupivacaine given intrathecally via combined spinal epidural (CSE) for labour pain relief in the first stage.
Sixty ASA I or II patients who requested for epidural analgesia were randomised to three groups. CSE was performed with a 16G Touhy needle and 27G Whitacre needle.
Patients in the sufentanil/bupivacaine group had a significantly longer duration of analgesia (162.9 min +/- 63.4) compared with fentanyl/bupivacaine (110.0 min +/- 44.6) compared with plain bupivacaine (70.0 min +/- 32.1). Pruritus was significant in patients with sufentanil (80%) and fentanyl (47.4%) but did not occur with plain bupivacaine. There was no significant difference in the incidence of nausea or vomiting, hypotension and motor blockade although blood pressures in the sufentanil group were consistently lower than the other two groups. Pain scores were lowest in the sufentanil group. Fetal heart rate changes and Apgar scores were not significantly different between the groups.
In combined spinal epidural for labour analgesia, adding sufentanil 10 micrograms to intrathecal bupivacaine 2.5 mg provided fast onset and good analgesia for a longer duration compared with adding fentanyl 10 micrograms and with plain bupivacaine. The main side effect was pruritus. Neonatal outcome was similar.
Ciprofloxacin is known to cause acute interstitial nephritis. We report the first case of ciprofloxacin-induced granulomatous interstitial nephritis and localized elastolysis. The patient presented with acute renal failure and skin lesions following a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin administered for cellulitis. The patient had symmetric, palm-sized, tender violaceous plaques on both axillae. The renal biopsy revealed granulomatous interstitial disease. A skin biopsy revealed an elastolytic process with histocytic infiltration and calcification. After discontinuing ciprofloxacin and starting a short course of steroid therapy, the skin lesion and renal function improved promptly. The nephritis relapsed after prednisone was discontinued and responded to a second course of steroid therapy. Ciprofloxacin, like penicillin, can cause granulomatous interstitial nephritis and elastolysis. A prolonged course of steroid therapy may be indicated in patients with ciprofloxacin-induced granulomatous interstitial nephritis to avoid early relapse.
G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) unrelated to nuclear estrogen receptors but strongly activated by 17β-estradiol in both mammals and fish. To date, the distribution and functional characterization of GPER within reproductive and nonreproductive vertebrate organs have been restricted to juvenile and adult animals. In contrast, virtually nothing is known about the spatiotemporal distribution and function of GPER during vertebrate embryogenesis. Using zebrafish as an animal model, we investigated the potential functional role and expression of GPER during embryogenesis. Based on real-time PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization, gper was expressed as early as 1 h postfertilization (hpf) and exhibited strong stage-dependent expression patterns during embryogenesis. At 26 and 38 hpf, gper mRNA was broadly distributed throughout the body, whereas from 50 to 98 hpf, gper expression was increasingly localized to the heart, brain, neuromasts, craniofacial region, and somite boundaries of developing zebrafish. Continuous exposure to a selective GPER agonist (G-1)-but not continuous exposure to a selective GPER antagonist (G-15)-from 5 to 96 hpf, or within three developmental windows ranging from 10 to 72 hpf, resulted in adverse concentration-dependent effects on survival, gross morphology, and somite formation within the trunk of developing zebrafish embryos. Importantly, based on co-exposure studies, G-15 blocked severe G-1-induced developmental toxicity, suggesting that G-1 toxicity is mediated via aberrant activation of GPER. Overall, our findings suggest that xenobiotic-induced GPER activation represents a potentially novel and understudied mechanism of toxicity for environmentally relevant chemicals that affect vertebrate embryogenesis.
The objective of the European Myocardial Infarct Amiodarone Trial (EMIAT) is to assess the efficacy of amiodarone on mortality of patients with depressed left ventricular (LV) function following myocardial infarction (MI). The rationale for the trial is as follows: patients with poor LV function after acute MI have a high sudden cardiac death (SCD) mortality; amiodarone is a successful prophylactic therapy against SCD in patients with ventricular arrhythmias; a number of small studies (Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial [CAMIAT] pilot study, Basel Antiarrhythmic Study & Infarct Survival [BASIS], and the Polish Amiodarone Trial [PAT]) of prophylactic amiodarone post AMI have shown a beneficial response attributable to amiodarone. Patients are enrolled between 5 and 21 days after acute MI if LV ejection fraction (assessed by multiple-gated image acquisition nuclear angiography) is < or = 40%. The study group is stratified according to ejection fraction (stratum 1, 31-40%; stratum 2, < 31%). Amiodarone or placebo treatment (blind, randomized) is initiated prior to the discharge of the patient from the hospital and each patient is followed up for the duration of the study, at least 1 year. Recruitment began on November 30, 1990, and will continue for 4 years; > 700 patients are enrolled from > 60 centers (13 countries). The total study mortality (10% at 500 days) and the differential mortality of both strata are as anticipated. Side effects have been infrequent and very few patients have been withdrawn from the study. Trial conclusion is forecast for October 1995.
Isoproterenol (IPR) administered to rats in a dose of 5 mg/kg for 4 days induces cardiac hypertrophy. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of prophylactic + simultaneous digitoxin treatment on the development of IPR-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Digitoxin (1 mg/kg body weight) was given per os, once daily for 6 days prior to IPR administration and continued simultaneously with IPR treatment. To determine myocardial enlargement, wet heart weight, myocardial nucleic acid and protein were measured. Digitoxin treatment induced slight but significant increase in wet ventricle weight and myocardial RNA content (mg/ventricle). At the same time the degree of IPR-induced cardiac hypertrophy in digitoxin-treated and untreated animals was nearly the same. On the basis of these results it can be stated that--unlike the cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload or hypoxia,--the IPR-induced cardiac hypertrophy is not altered by digitoxin administration.
As part of a Phase I clinical trial, 5 patients received 5-fluorouracil (FU) both singly and in combination with misonidazole (MISO) for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer. Concentrations of total FU and F-containing metabolites in urine specimens, taken during 48 h after therapy, were determined. The clearance of FU following administration of 1.0 or 1.5 g FU m2 was significantly reduced by treatment with MISO (1.75-2.0 gm-2) given 2 h prior to FU therapy. Reduced clearance of FU by MISO was associated with an earlier onset of the period of nonlinearity of FU pharmacokinetics and an increased half-life of elimination. Furthermore, the clearance of FU correlated inversely with the severity of gastrointestinal toxicity. The mechanism of MISO enhancement of FU action is unlikely to be competition for microsomal enzymes, as proposed for the interaction of MISO and alkylating agents, since FU is catabolized at mitochondrial and cytosolic sites.
Mercury is a widespread environmental contaminant with neurotoxic impacts that have been observed over a range of exposures. In addition, there is increasing evidence that inorganic mercury (iHg) and organic mercury (including methyl mercury) have a range of immunotoxic effects, including immune suppression and induction of autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated the effect of iHg on a model of autoimmune heart disease in mice induced by infection with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). We examined the role of timing of iHg exposure on disease; in some experiments, mice were pretreated with iHg (200 μg/kg, every other day for 15 days) before disease induction with virus inoculation, and in others, they were treated with iHg after the acute (viral) phase of disease but before the development of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). iHg alone had no effect on heart pathology. Pretreatment with iHg before CVB3 infection significantly increased the severity of chronic myocarditis and DCM compared with control animals receiving vehicle alone. In contrast, treatment with iHg after acute myocarditis did not affect the severity of chronic disease. The increased chronic myocarditis, fibrosis, and DCM induced by iHg pretreatment were not due to increased viral replication in the heart, which was unaltered by iHg treatment. iHg pretreatment induced a macrophage infiltrate and mixed cytokine response in the heart during acute myocarditis, including significantly increased interleukin (IL)-12, IL-17, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α levels. IL-17 levels were also significantly increased in the spleen during chronic disease. Thus, we show for the first time that low-dose Hg exposure increases chronic myocarditis and DCM in a murine model.
Oct4 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. Down-regulation of Oct4 is associated with the differentiation of trophectoderm cell lineage, from which the normal placenta derives. We investigated the methylation and expression status of Oct4 in normal placenta and gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) as attempts to investigate the role of Oct4 in the pathogenesis of GTD. By methylation-specific PCR, we observed both methylated and unmethylated Oct4 alleles in all 25 first trimester and 10 term placentas while 33% (18/54) of hydatidiform moles, and two choriocarcinoma cell line (JEG3 and JAR), only displayed methylated Oct4 allele. By quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR, Oct4 mRNA was significantly reduced in hydatidiform moles (P=0.04), JEG3 and JAR (P=0.024) when compared with normal placentas. Oct4 methylation was significantly correlated with Oct4 mRNA expression in placenta and GTD (P=0.012). Hypermethylation in minimal promoter and exon 1 region of Oct4 were confirmed in JEG3 and JAR by bisulfite genomic sequencing. The Oct4 mRNA expression in JEG3 and JAR increased after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A. Our findings suggest that Oct4 is down-regulated by hypermethylation in normal placenta and GTD and such process is important in pathogenesis of GTD.
Several studies suggest that a dopamine transporter uptake inhibitor that has a slower onset and longer duration of action than cocaine in animal behavioral measures and decreases cocaine self-administration would be useful as an indirect dopamine agonist pharmacotherapy to treat cocaine addiction. In the present study, we compared five 3-phenyltropane analogs administered orally in locomotor activity in mice and drug discrimination in rats to gain information concerning relative potency, onset, and duration of action. The compounds were also evaluated for reduction of cocaine self-administration in rats after oral administration. In general, the compounds had a slower onset of action than cocaine and reduced cocaine self-administration. 3beta-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2beta-(3-(4'-methylphenyl)-isoxazol-5-yl)tropane (RTI-336) was the most potent in locomotor activity and drug discrimination; it was less stimulatory than cocaine in the first hour and had the slowest onset and longest duration of action. It also reduced self-administration of two infusion doses of cocaine in the rat.
Left ventricular systolic time intervals were assessed in 16 preterm infants with symptomatic left-to-right ductal shunts, before, during and after digoxin therapy. An intravenous loading dose of digoxin, 20 micrograms/kg, resulted in a serum digoxin concentration of 1.94 +/- 0.44 nmol/l (mean +/- 1 SD) but in no significant change in heart rate or systolic time intervals. Digoxin maintenance, 2.5 micrograms/kg/12 h, led 3-7 days later to serum concentrations of 2.57 +/- 1.06 nmol/l with an associated shortening of left ventricular ejection time (p less than 0.05) which probably reflected a reduced ductal shunt. Digoxin therapy was withdrawn after ductal closure. The terminal serum half-life was 87 +/- 17 h. Decreasing digoxin concentrations were associated with prolongation of left ventricular ejection time (p less than 0.01). Digoxin therapy did not seem to influence left ventricular systolic time intervals while ductal patency persisted. This may be attributed to limitations of the method or the left ventricle already working at its maximum.
The hippocampus has been a subject of numerous studies of behavior and memory in patients who demonstrate atrophy, sclerosis, or injury by autopsy or imaging. It has also been studied in patients who undergo surgical treatment for intractable epilepsy. The effects of hypoxia and ischemia on the hippocampus have been studied in animals; however, human cases of hippocampal stroke are rarely reported. The authors report a case of bilateral hippocampal stroke in a patient with severe ischemia secondary to cardiac arrest and cocaine exposure. These findings likely resulted from the combination of hypoxia and cocaine-related excitotoxicity.
