Prolongation of the corrected Q-T (Q-Tc) interval is associated with a risk of severe and even life-threatening arrythmias. It may occur as an adverse effect of various pharmacological agents including macrolides. We opted to study the influence of the azalide antibiotic azithromycin on the duration of Q-Tc interval as data on this subject are limited.
A prospective study was performed on 47 patients, 31 females and 16 males, aged 19-77 (median 52) years, treated with azithromycin (total dosage 3 g, divided over 5 days) for typical solitary erythema migrans. The patients were previously healthy and were not receiving any other medication. In all of them ECGs were performed before as well as 7 and 14 days after initiation of the azithromycin therapy. Thus, a total of 141 ECG tracings were analyzed. Q-T intervals were measured manually in a blinded manner and corrected for heart rate according to Bazzet's formula: Q-Tc = measured Q-T (ms)/square root of R-R (s).
Comparison of the Q-Tc intervals before, 7 days, and 14 days after the initiation of azithromycin treatment revealed a mild, but not significant prolongation (median values 406, 412.5 and 419 ms with ranges of 339-488, 352-510, and 346-505 ms, respectively). Q-Tc intervals exceeding the upper normal value of 440 ms were found in the same proportion of patients prior to as after institution of treatment. None of the ECG tracings showed significant arrhythmias.
In previously healthy persons, a modest statistically insignificant prolongation of the Q-Tc interval without clinical consequences was observed after completion of a course of 3 g of azithromycin administered over a period of 5 days for solitary erythema migrans.
Tolcapone, a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, can interfere with the metabolism of levodopa and dopamine and could prolong the motor effect induced by levodopa in parkinsonian patients. To test this hypothesis, we studied the motor effect induced by three acute administrations of a dose of levodopa-benserazide (Madopar) with either 200 mg or 400 mg of tolcapone or placebo, in a double-blind latin-square design. The duration of the on-phase could be compared in 10 parkinsonian patients suffering from square-shaped motor effect. In comparison to placebo, 200 mg and 400 mg of tolcapone significantly increased the mean duration of the on-phase by 61.7 min ( +/- 19.4 SEM) and by 72.2 min ( +/- 18.5), respectively. This clinical effect is suggested to be related mainly to the increase in levodopa area under the curve and half-life induced by tolcapone. The intensity in dyskinesias was increased by 400 mg of tolcapone. Tolcapone appears to be well tolerated and could be helpful as an adjuvant treatment to levodopa in parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations.
The present paper reports 2 cases of methamphetamine abuse. Following consecutive methamphetamine administration, the patients developed acute intoxication, during which time they showed a unique type of disturbance of consciousness: delirium and twilight state. In both cases, mental status changed, passing through three distinct stages: restlessness and insomnia, hallucinatory paranoid state, and disturbance of consciousness. A review of the literature suggests that disturbance of consciousness may occur occasionally during the course of amphetamine and methamphetamine intoxication, although these symptoms can be overlooked easily due to confounding symptomatology.
p53 inactivation sensitizes U87MG astrocytic glioma cells to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and temozolomide (TMZ), drugs used clinically to treat high-grade astrocytomas. In this report, we examined the effect of p53 inactivation on the chemosensitivity of two additional human astrocytic glioma cell lines, D54 and A172, in order to assess whether sensitization is a general property of astrocytic tumor cells. Compared to control cells with intact p53 function, derived lines in which p53 was inactivated displayed significantly reduced clonogenic survival after exposure to BCNU and TMZ. Sensitization to both BCNU and TMZ was associated with failure of p21(WAF1) induction, lack of a sustained G2 cell cycle arrest and significant tumor cell death. These findings suggest that enhanced sensitivity to BCNU and TMZ is a general property of human astrocytic glioma cells in which p53 was disrupted. In contrast, p53 inactivation rendered D54 and U87MG cells significantly more resistant to cis-dichlorodiamminoplatinum (CDDP), another chemotherapeutic to which high-grade astrocytomas sometimes respond. These results indicate that p53 status influences the chemosensitivity of astrocytic glioma cells in a drug-type specific manner, a finding that may have implications for the selection of drug treatments for patients with astrocytic gliomas.
Fatal hemolytic anemia occurred in a 71-year-old man after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was given for presumed cystitis. Administration of this combination has previously caused multiple hematologic reactions by affecting folic acid metabolism. Megaloblastic anemia and neutropenia have been produced by both of these agents, while sulfamethoxazole alone has induced acute hemolytic anemia in patients with hereditary deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Although hematologic complications of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment usually follow long-term or high-dose therapy, acute reactions apparently may occur at lower doses as well.
The molecules underlying neuron loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) are essentially unknown, and current therapies focus on diminishing symptoms rather than preventing neuron death. We identified RTP801 as a gene whose transcripts were highly induced in a cellular model of PD in which death of neuronal catecholaminergic PC12 cells was triggered by the PD mimetic 6-OHDA. Here, we find that RTP801 protein is also induced in this and additional cellular and animal PD models. To assess the relevance of these observations to PD, we used immunohistochemistry to compare RTP801 expression in postmortem brains from PD and control patients. For all PD brains examined, expression was highly elevated within neuromelanin-containing neurons of the substantia nigra but not in cerebellar neurons. Evaluation of the potential role of RTP801 induction in our cellular model revealed that RTP801 overexpression is sufficient to promote death but does not further elevate death caused by 6-OHDA. Furthermore, RTP801 induction is requisite for death in our cellular PD models and in 6-OHDA-treated cultured sympathetic neurons in that its knockdown by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) is protective. The mechanism by which 6-OHDA and RTP801 induce neuron death appears to involve repression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase activity, and such death is inhibited by shRNAs targeting TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex), a protein with which RTP801 interacts to block mTOR activation. Our findings thus suggest that the elevation of RTP801 we detect in PD substantia nigral neurons may mediate their degeneration and death and that RTP801 and its signaling cascade may be novel potential therapeutic targets for the disease.
A sublingual soluble-film formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone (B/N) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of opioid dependency. This preparation provides unit-dose, child-resistant packaging amenable to tracking and accountability, offers more rapid dissolution, and has a potentially preferred taste vs. tablets. This study compared the ability of buprenorphine (B) and B/N films to suppress spontaneous withdrawal in opioid-dependent volunteers. Participants were maintained on morphine and underwent challenge sessions to confirm sensitivity to naloxone-induced opioid withdrawal. Subjects were randomized to receive either B (16 mg, n = 18) or B/N (16/4 mg, n = 16) soluble films for 5 days. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score. Thirty-four subjects completed induction onto soluble films. There was a significant decrease in COWS scores but no significant differences between the groups. The results support the use of B and B/N soluble films as safe and effective delivery methods for opioid induction.
The effects of a sustained-release formulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH-SR) on learning impairments induced by scopolamine and a cholinergic neurotoxin, ethylcholine aziridinium ion (AF64A), were examined in rodents. Subcutaneous injection of TRH-SR (2.8 mg/kg as free TRH) produced a sustained increase in immunoreactive plasma TRH levels up to about 2 weeks after dosing in rats. TRH-SR (0.56 and 2.8 mg/kg) given subcutaneously 7 days before the acquisition trial markedly ameliorated scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice, as evaluated with a passive avoidance task. Repeated administration of TRH for 7 days at doses of 0.2-5 mg/kg s.c. elicited a dose-dependent recovery from amnesia induced by scopolamine, whereas only the group treated with 5 mg/kg/day showed a significant improvement. The rats with bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of AF64A (3.75 nmol/brain) showed a significant impairment in the water maze task 2 weeks after surgery. TRH-SR (0.56 and 2.8 mg/kg) also exhibited a dose-dependent ameliorating action on the deficit. These findings indicate that TRH-SR ameliorates learning impairments produced by scopolamine and AF64A, and suggest that continuous infusion of TRH may have a potent learning and memory improving action at low doses.
Experiments on open-chest anaesthetized cats were made to test derivatives of crown ethers, such as benzylase-15-crown-5 and dibenzylase-15-crown-5 for their effects on myocardial ischemia and the functional status of a myocardial ischemic focus in temporary coronary occlusion during coronary spasm induced by dihydroergotamine and during coronary microthrombosis caused by ADP. When intravenously administered in doses of 0.5-15 mg/kg, the tested agents were found to enhance myocardial tolerance to ischemia, depressed ST segment in ischemia induced by coronary occlusion and administration of ATP, and prevented ST-segment depression during coronary spasm.
The efficacy and tolerability of a once-daily, fixed combination of 50 mg atenolol and 20 mg nifedipine slow release were evaluated in a 12-month open study of 27 elderly hypertensives who were either newly presenting patients or were those who were inadequately controlled on previous monotherapy or had unacceptable side-effects with their current therapy. After 1-month's therapy with the combination, the mean sitting blood pressure 1 to 4 hours post-dose decreased from 176/103 mmHg to 146/83 mmHg and was maintained at this level for the remainder of the study. Eight patients complained of side-effects on study entry. Sixteen had complaints at some time during the 12 months of fixed combination treatment and 4 were withdrawn because of side-effects. Dizziness occurred in 6 patients on the combination but, as with side-effects overall, tended to resolve with time; its occurrence did not appear to correlate with the on-treatment blood pressure. In this group of elderly hypertension patients, therefore, the combination therapy with atenolol plus nifedipine slow release appeared to exert a greater antihypertensive effect compared with previous therapy, which included atenolol alone, with no evidence of tachyphylaxis and was reasonably well-tolerated over a 12-month period.
Acromegaly is a unique condition characterized by chronic growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) hypersecretion usually due to a pituitary adenoma. Rarely, acromegaly can result from a GH-releasing hormone carcinoid or pancreatic neoplasm which stimulates the normal pituitary to secrete GH. This review describes the interactions between acromegaly and the gastrointestinal system. In contrast to the soft tissue and skeletal changes, clinical organomegaly of the liver, kidney, and spleen is unusual in patients with acromegaly and should warrant further investigations. The prevalence of cholelithiasis is notably increased by the use of the otherwise effective GH-lowering somatostatin analog, octreotide. Patients on long-term therapy with this agent may require anticholelithogenic treatment. The frequency of malignant and premalignant polyps of the colon justify the routine screening for these lesions in newly diagnosed patients with acromegaly.
The RENAAL (Reduction of Endpoints in Non-insulin dependent diabetes with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan) study demonstrated that, in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy, treatment with losartan plus conventional antihypertensive therapy (CT) reduced the relative risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by 29% versus placebo over the time span of the study (mean patient follow-up of 3.4 years). The objective of this study was to project the effect of losartan compared with placebo on the lifetime incidence of ESRD and associated costs (from a US healthcare system perspective).
To estimate lifetime incidence of ESRD, we used a competing risks method to account for the risk of death without ESRD. We estimated the cost (US dollars, year 2002 values) associated with ESRD by combining the cumulative incidence of ESRD with the lifetime cost associated with ESRD. Total cost was estimated as the sum of the cost associated with ESRD, the cost of losartan study therapy and other costs (non-ESRD/non-losartan) expected for patients with type 2 diabetes. Survival was estimated by weighting the life expectancies with and without ESRD by the cumulative risk of ESRD. Costs and outcomes were discounted by 3% per annum.
We projected a lower lifetime incidence of ESRD for losartan patients (66%) compared with placebo patients (83%). This reduction in ESRD resulted in a decrease in cost associated with ESRD of US dollars 31,803 per patient and a gain of 0.99 life-years per patient (0.70 discounted). After accounting for the cost of losartan and the additional cost associated with greater survival, we projected that treatment with losartan would result in a lifetime net saving of US dollars 24,632 per patient.
Treatment with losartan plus CT in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy reduced the within-trial incidence of ESRD and is projected to result in lifetime reductions in ESRD and associated costs, and increased survival, versus placebo.
Prenatal administration of synthetic estrogens in humans as well as lower mammals was reported to alter behavior in adulthood. The alterations remain to be characterized according to specific pathophysiological hypotheses. In this study, three common behavioral models of schizophrenia were tested, i.e., latent inhibition (LI), prepulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI) and hyperlocomotion under amphetamine. Female Long-Evans rats were injected i.p. with a solution of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (15 microg kg(-1)) everyday from day 9 to 14 of pregnancy, and behavioral characteristics of their offspring, raised by Wistar foster mothers, were compared to those of rats born from dams injected with the vehicle only, over the same gestation period. LI was tested in a conditioned taste aversion and a conditioned passive avoidance paradigm followed by a parametric study of PPI and an evaluation of locomotion in an open field under saline or amphetamine (1.5 mg kg(-1)). Histological brain measurements were also carried out in a subset of the same rats. Neither LI nor PPI was altered using methods that had proven sensitive in previous pharmacological studies. Treated rats' locomotion was impaired, but amphetamine did not elicit a differential enhancement. A thinner Amon's horn layer was observed in their hippocampus. This indicates that standard models of schizophrenia did not fit to the behavioral abnormalities found by others and confirmed in this study. They were not due to the abnormal maternal care to pups elicited by the treatment.
Estimation of free polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in blood and evaluation of behavior of autistic children before and after taking fish oil (Efalex) were performed.
30 autistic children (18 males and 12 females) aged 3-11 years and 30 healthy children as control group were included in this study. Tandem mass spectrometry and CARS were used to estimate the free PUFAs from dried blood spot and to evaluate the autistic behavior respectively.
Before taking Efalex, linolenic acid showed a significant reduction (71%), followed by docosahexaenoic acid (65%) and arachidonic acid (45%), while linoleic acid was the least affected PUFA (32%). After taking Efalex, 66% of autistic children showed clinical and biochemical improvement, linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid showed the highest levels after Efalex supplementation.
PUFA supplementation may play an important role in ameliorating the autistic behavior.
The long arm of chromosome 8 is one of the most common regions of amplification in cancers of several organs, especially carcinomas of the breast and prostate. TRPS1, MYC and EIF3S3 genes are located in one of the minimal regions of amplification, 8q23-q24, and have been suggested to be the target genes of the amplification. Here, our goal was to study copy number and expression of the three genes in order to investigate the significance of the genes in breast and prostate cancer. By using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), we first found that TRPS1 and EIF3S3 were amplified together in about one-third of hormone-refractory prostate carcinomas. Next, we analysed the mRNA expression of the three genes by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and the gene copy number by FISH in six breast and five prostate cancer cell lines. Breast cancer cell line, SK-Br-3, which contained the highest copy number of all three genes, showed overexpression of only EIF3S3. Finally, the expression levels of TRPS1, EIF3S3 and MYC were measured in freshly frozen clinical samples of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), as well as untreated and hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma. The TRPS1 and MYC expression levels were similar in all prostate tumour groups, whereas EIF3S3 expression was higher (P=0.029) in prostate carcinomas compared to BPH. The data suggest that the expression of EIF3S3 is increased in prostate cancer, and that one of the mechanisms underlying the overexpression is the amplification of the gene.
Maintenance antisecretory therapy is often used to prevent duodenal ulcer recurrence and control symptoms. This study compared the efficacy and safety of lansoprazole 15 mg and 30 mg daily with placebo in preventing ulcer recurrence in patients with a recent history of duodenal ulcer disease.
Fifty-six patients were treated with either lansoprazole 15 mg, 30 mg or placebo o.m.
Within 1 month of study initiation, 27% (four out of 15) of placebo-treated patients experienced ulcer recurrence as compared to 13% (two out of 15) and 6% (one out of 18) of lansoprazole 15 mg and 30 mg treated patients, respectively. Median time to first ulcer recurrence was > 12 months in lansoprazole patients. At Month 12, significantly (P < 0.001) more lansoprazole 15 mg patients (70%) and lansoprazole 30 mg patients (85%) remained healed. Eighty-two per cent of lansoprazole 15 mg and 76% of lansoprazole 30 mg patients remained asymptomatic during the entire study period. All placebo patients became symptomatic, experienced ulcer recurrence, or withdrew from the study by month six. The incidence of adverse events was comparable among the three treatment groups.
Lansoprazole safely and effectively reduces duodenal ulcer recurrence and ulcer-related symptoms.
Accumulating evidence suggests that neurodegeneration induced by pathogenic proteins depends on contributions from surrounding glia. Here we demonstrate that NF-kappaB signaling in microglia is critically involved in neuronal death induced by amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, which are widely presumed to cause Alzheimer disease. Constitutive inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling in microglia by expression of the nondegradable IkappaBalpha superrepressor blocked neurotoxicity, indicating a pivotal role for microglial NF-kappaB signaling in mediating Abeta toxicity. Stimulation of microglia with Abeta increased acetylation of RelA/p65 at lysine 310, which regulates the NF-kappaB pathway. Overexpression of SIRT1 deacetylase and the addition of the SIRT1 agonist resveratrol markedly reduced NF-kappaB signaling stimulated by Abeta and had strong neuroprotective effects. Our results support a glial loop hypothesis by demonstrating a critical role for microglial NF-kappaB signaling in Abeta-dependent neurodegeneration. They also implicate SIRT1 in this pathway and highlight the therapeutic potential of resveratrol and other sirtuin-activating compounds in Alzheimer disease.
We and others reported time-dependent increases in cue-induced cocaine seeking after withdrawal, suggesting that craving incubates over time. Recently, we found that central amygdala extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and glutamate are involved in this incubation. Here, we further explored the role of central amygdala glutamate in the incubation of cocaine craving by determining the effect of systemic or central amygdala injections of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 (which decreases glutamate release) on cue-induced cocaine seeking during early and late withdrawal.
Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 10 days (6 hours/day); infusions were paired with a tone-light cue. Cocaine seeking and craving after systemic or central amygdala injections of LY379268 were then assessed in extinction tests in the presence of the cocaine-associated cues during early (day 3) or late (day 21) withdrawal.
Systemic (1.5 or 3 mg/kg) or central amygdala (.5 or 1.0 microg/side) injections of LY379268 attenuated enhanced extinction responding on day 21 but had no effect on lower extinction responding on day 3.
Results confirm our previous findings on the role of central amygdala glutamate in the incubation of cocaine craving and together with previous reports suggest that mGluR(2/3) agonists should be considered in the treatment of drug relapse.
This study examined effects of S-allyl cysteine (SAC) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced interstitial pulmonary fibrosis in Wistar rats. CCl4 (0.5 ml/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into rats twice a week for 8 weeks, and SAC (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg), N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 200 or 600 mg/kg), or L-cysteine (CYS, 600 mg/kg) were orally administrated to rats everyday for 8 weeks. SAC significantly reduced the increases of transforming growth factor beta, lipid peroxides, AST, and ALT in plasma, induced by CCl4. Although CCl4 is mainly metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450, CCl4 induced systemic inflammation and some organ fibrosis. SAC dose-dependently and significantly attenuated CCl4-induced systemic inflammation and fibrosis of lung. SAC also inhibited the decrease of thiol levels, the increase of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, the infiltration of leukocytes, and the generation of reactive oxygen species in lungs. Although NAC and CYS attenuated CCl4-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, the order of preventive potency was SAC > NAC > CYS according to their applied doses. These results indicate that SAC is more effective than other cysteine compounds in reducing CCl4-induced lung injury, and might be useful in prevention of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
The effects of long-term administration of doxorubicin in adult rabbits and in a rhesus monkey were studied. Eleven rabbits were given cumulative doses of 2--24 mg/kg over a period of 5--28 weeks. The monkey received a total of 20 mg/kg during a 10-month period. One rabbit exhibited hind leg paresis, but all of the other animals in the study remained clinically free of neurologic signs. Rabbits given less than 12 mg/kg of doxorubicin had only mild degenerative changes in dorsal roots and a few necrotic neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, but these lesions were much more severe in all rabbits when a cumulative dose greater than 16 mg/kg was given. The monkey also had severe ganglioneuropathy, suggesting that primates may also be susceptible to this toxic effect of doxorubicin. Although neurotoxicity has not been observed with the dose schedules of doxorubicin used in clinical practice, the tendency of this drug to damage both postmitotic neural and cardiac cells may provide added understanding of the clinically important doxorubicin cardiomyopathy.
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) regulates the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in thyroid carcinoma cells. Both pathways are associated with aggressive phenotype in thyroid carcinomas.
Our objective was to assess the effects of the clinical PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 and genetic inhibition of PI3K and HIF on metastatic behavior of thyroid carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.
Vascular endothelial growth factor ELISA, HIF activity assays, proliferation studies, and scratch-wound migration and cell spreading assays were performed under various O(2) tensions [normoxia, hypoxia (1 and 0.1% O(2)), and anoxia] with or without GDC-0941 in a panel of four thyroid carcinoma cell lines (BcPAP, WRO, FTC133, and 8505c). Genetic inhibition was achieved by overexpressing phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) into PTEN-null cells and by using a dominant-negative variant of HIF-1α (dnHIF). In vivo, human enhanced green fluorescence protein-expressing follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC) were treated with GDC-0941 (orally). Spontaneous lung metastasis was confirmed by viewing enhanced green fluorescence protein-positive colonies cultured from lung tissue.
GDC-0941 inhibited hypoxia/anoxia-induced HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression and HIF activity in thyroid carcinoma cells. Basal (three of four cell lines) and/or hypoxia-induced (four of four) secreted vascular endothelial growth factor was inhibited by GDC-0941, whereas selective HIF targeting predominantly affected hypoxia/anoxia-mediated secretion (P < 0.05-0.0001). Antiproliferative effects of GDC-0941 were more pronounced in PTEN mutant compared with PTEN-restored cells (P < 0.05). Hypoxia increased migration in papillary cells and cell spreading/migration in FTC cells (P < 0.01). GDC-0941 reduced spreading and migration in all O(2) conditions, whereas dnHIF had an impact only on hypoxia-induced migration (P < 0.001). In vivo, GDC-0941 reduced expression of HIF-1α, phospho-AKT, GLUT-1, and lactate dehydrogenase A in FTC xenografts. DnHIF expression and GDC-0941 reduced FTC tumor growth and metastatic lung colonization (P < 0.05).
PI3K plays a prominent role in the metastatic behavior of thyroid carcinoma cells irrespective of O(2) tension and appears upstream of HIF activation. GDC-0941 significantly inhibited the metastatic phenotype, supporting the clinical development of PI3K inhibition in thyroid carcinomas.
Authors report on a case of a 46-year-old woman, as a rare complication of anticoagulant therapy. Rupture of giant haemangioma of the liver developed after Syncumar treatment. They describe the successful resection of the ruptured tumor, which caused haemorrhagic shock. Based on the review of the literature the authors are the first in Hungary to report on an urgent resection of haemangioma in adult.
Eleven patients with essential hypertension were given hydralazine (25 mg b.i.d.) for 2 weeks, hydralazine and propranolol (80 mg b.i.d.) for the next 2 weeks, and propranolol alone for the last 2 weeks. The changes in the renal and systemic circulation elicited by the drugs were studied before start of medication and bi-weekly during the treatment, using non-invasive radioisotope techniques. Hydralazine alone did not alter mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), peripheral renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (Aldo) but when propranolol was added MAP fell 15.2%, HR 22.5% and CI 18.4%, while ERPF was unchanged. When hydralazine was withdrawn and propranolol was given alone, ERPF decreased 13.2%. Plasma aldosterone was unchanged, whereas PRA decreased during propranolol treatment. The reduction in ERPF elicited by propranolol, was highly significant (P less than 0.01). From the test sequence it appears that dihydralazine prevents this effect of propranolol on kidney function. These findings might have a direct bearing on the choice of antihypertensive treatment.
Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is a protein involved in repair of DNA platinum adducts and stalled DNA replication forks. We and others have previously shown the influence of ERCC1 expression upon survival rates and benefit of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, little is known about the molecular characteristics of ERCC1-positive and ERCC1-negative tumors.
We took advantage of a cohort of 91 patients with resected NSCLC, for which we had matched frozen and paraffin-embedded samples to explore the comparative molecular portraits of ERCC1-positive and ERCC1-negative tumors of NSCLC. We carried out a global molecular analysis including assessment of ERCC1 expression levels by using both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), genomic instability, global gene and miRNA expression, and sequencing of selected key genes involved in lung carcinogenesis.
ERCC1 protein and mRNA expression were significantly correlated. However, we observed several cases with clear discrepancies. We noted that ERCC1-negative tumors had a higher rate of genomic abnormalities versus ERCC1-positive tumors. ERCC1-positive tumors seemed to share a common DNA damage response (DDR) phenotype with the overexpression of seven genes linked to DDR. The miRNA expression analysis identified miR-375 as significantly underexpressed in ERCC1-positive tumors.
Our data show inconsistencies in ERCC1 expression between IHC and qRT-PCR readouts. Furthermore, ERCC1 status is not linked to specific mutational patterns or frequencies. Finally, ERCC1-negative tumors have a high rate of genomic aberrations that could consequently influence prognosis in patients with resected NSCLC.
Cold ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a prominent cause of delayed graft function after kidney transplantation. Reactive oxygen species play a crucial role in I/R injury. Edaravone is a synthetic radical scavenger that has been used in acute stroke. Some animal experiments have revealed its beneficial effects against I/R injury, but its effects after cold preservation and transplantation of canine kidneys are unknown.
Female hybrid dogs weighing 11 to 13 kg were used. Under anesthesia, the left kidney was harvested. After 72 hr of preservation in cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution, autotransplantation was performed in the right iliac fossa, with contralateral nephrectomy. Animals were divided into control and treatment groups (n=6 per group). In the treatment group, edaravone was administered intravenously at harvest and at reperfusion (3 mg/kg) and in addition was added to the preservation solution (50 microM).
Animal survival at 2 weeks was four of six in the control group and six of six in the treatment group. Compared with controls, treated animals had higher mean urine output, higher mean glomerular filtration rate, improved tubular cell function, lower mean serum creatinine, and lower renal vascular resistance. Biopsy specimens from treated animals showed less tubular cell damage and decreased P-selectin expression in endothelial cells. Lipid peroxidation of renal tissue and urinary excretion of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine were suppressed by the treatment.
Edaravone reduced cold I/R injury in canine renal transplantation. The agent has the potential to ameliorate preservation injury in clinical transplantation.
A 45-year-old man, with a 10-year history of manic depression treated with lithium, was admitted with hyperosmolar, nonketotic coma. He gave a five-year history of polyuria and polydipsia, during which time urinalysis had been negative for glucose. After recovery from hyperglycaemia, he remained polyuric despite normal blood glucose concentrations; water deprivation testing indicated nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, likely to be lithium-induced. We hypothesize that when this man developed type 2 diabetes, chronic polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus was sufficient to precipitate hyperosmolar dehydration.
