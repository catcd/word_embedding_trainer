The clinical, neurophysiologic, and genetic findings in two Japanese patients with the Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy are described. The cystatin B gene of Patient 1 exhibited expansion of the dodecamer (12-mer) repeat located in the 5' region and a point mutation (G-->A mutation) in exon 2. The cystatin B gene of Patient 2 exhibited homozygous expansion of the dodecamer repeat. Both parents of Patient 2 were heterozygous carriers. The two patients had a similar clinical course, and their symptoms were similar to those of previously reported patients in Finland. They both had a good response to zonisamide and low-dose primidone. We recommend that zonisamide and low-dose primidone should be introduced as the first drugs of choice for the treatment of patients with the Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy.
The changes in the activities of certain lysosomal hydrolases, viz., beta-glucuronidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-glucosidase, alpha-galactosidase, alpha-mannosidase, cathepsin B, cathepsin D, and collagenolytic cathepsin, in serum and heart of rats subject to myocardial infarction with isoproterenol, were studied during the periods of peak infarction and recovery. The activities of all the enzymes assayed exhibited a significant increase both in serum and in heart at peak infarction stage and these levels returned to normal during the stage of recovery and repair. The infiltration of inflammatory cells at the infarct regions and the altered lysosomal fragility are probably responsible for the increased activity of the enzymes studied. This may also bring about the catabolism of connective tissue constituents as reported in literature.
After administration methylergometrine 30 minutes after delivery for peripartal vaginal bleeding a 31-year-old female patient developed an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography 7 hours after beginning of the chest pain demonstrated a dissection with a large thrombus in the proximal left anterior descending artery, followed by a complete occlusion in the periphery of the vessel (Figure 1). After applying rtPA intravenously, coronary angiography showed 24 hours later an open vessel without thrombotic material (Figure 2).
Coronary artery spasm induced by methylergometrine must be regarded as the main reason for the dissection and thrombus formation followed by a myocardial infarction.
Aldose reductase (AR) is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic eye diseases, including cataract and retinopathy. However, not all diabetics develop ocular complications. Paradoxically, some diabetics with poor metabolic control appear to be protected against retinopathy, while others with a history of excellent metabolic control develop severe complications. These observations indicate that one or more risk factors may influence the likelihood that an individual with diabetes will develop cataracts and/or retinopathy. We hypothesize that an elevated level of AR gene expression could confer higher risk for development of diabetic eye disease. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the onset and severity of diabetes-induced cataract in transgenic mice, designated AR-TG, that were either heterozygous or homozygous for the human AR (AKR1B1) transgene construct. AR-TG mice homozygous for the transgene demonstrated a conditional cataract phenotype, whereby they developed lens vacuoles and cataract-associated structural changes only after induction of experimental diabetes; no such changes were observed in AR-TG heterozygotes or nontransgenic mice with or without experimental diabetes induction. We observed that nondiabetic AR-TG mice did not show lens structural changes even though they had lenticular sorbitol levels almost as high as the diabetic AR-TG lenses that showed early signs of cataract. Over-expression of AR led to increases in the ratio of activated to total levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal (JNK1/2), which are known to be involved in cell growth and apoptosis, respectively. After diabetes induction, AR-TG but not WT controls had decreased levels of phosphorylated as well as total ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 compared to their nondiabetic counterparts. These results indicate that high AR expression in the context of hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency may constitute a risk factor that could predispose the lens to disturbances in signaling through the ERK and JNK pathways and thereby alter the balance of cell growth and apoptosis that is critical to lens transparency and homeostasis.
The diagnostic accuracy of the physical and pharmacological stress echocardiography tests is higher than routine exercise electrocardiography. They have an acceptable safety profile and have been rarely associated with severe adverse effects.
We present a case of acute anterior myocardial reinfarction immediately after exercise and pharmacological (dipyridamole-atropine) stress echocardiography testing 1 month after successful stent implantation in LAD. Our patient was a 43-year-old man with a history of heavy smoking and hypertension. Remarkably, the stress echocardiogram was non-diagnostic few hours before the infarction occurred. Angiography performed 4 months after the reinfarction revealed neither a culprit lesion nor stent thrombosis.
Aggressive "last generation" pharmacological stress testing may provide optimal diagnostic accuracy, but as in our case, complications may occur, even after negative stress testing. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an acute myocardial infarction as a severe complication of stress testing, which developed in a patient after stent implantation.
Curcumin is a major component of the plant Curcuma longa L. It is traditionally used as a spice and coloring in foods and is an important ingredient in curry. Curcuminoids have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and gained increasing attention as potential neuroprotective and cancer preventive compounds. In the present study, we report that curcumin is a potent tight-binding inhibitor of human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1, Ki=223nM). Curcumin acts as a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate 2,3-hexandione as revealed by plotting IC50-values against various substrate concentrations and most likely as a competitive inhibitor with respect to NADPH. Molecular modeling supports the finding that curcumin occupies the cofactor binding site of CBR1. Interestingly, CBR1 is one of the most effective human reductases in converting the anthracycline anti-tumor drug daunorubicin to daunorubicinol. The secondary alcohol metabolite daunorubicinol has significantly reduced anti-tumor activity and shows increased cardiotoxicity, thereby limiting the clinical use of daunorubicin. Thus, inhibition of CBR1 may increase the efficacy of daunorubicin in cancer tissue and simultaneously decrease its cardiotoxicity. Western-blots demonstrated basal expression of CBR1 in several cell lines. Significantly less daunorubicin reduction was detected after incubating A549 cell lysates with increasing concentrations of curcumin (up to 60% less with 50Î¼M curcumin), suggesting a beneficial effect in the co-treatment of anthracycline anti-tumor drugs together with curcumin.
Free radicals are known to cause secondary neuronal damage in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). We investigated here the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol, a potent antioxidant present in grape seed, against cerebral I/R-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions in hippocampus. Transient rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of brain ischemia was used to induce brain infarction. Resveratrol (10(-7) g/kg) was given twice intravenously: 15 min pre-occlusion and at the time of reperfusion (2 h post-occlusion). Resveratrol significantly restored ATP content and the activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes in resveratrol treated group which were severely altered in MCAO group. Western blot analysis showed a marked decrease in cytochrome c release as a result of resveratrol treatment. Electrophoretic migration of hippocampal genomic DNA showed a marked decrease in DNA fragmentation after resveratrol treatment. Notably, expression of Hsp70 and metallothionein (MT) was significantly higher in MCAO group but their expression was more significant in resveratrol treated group. The status of mitochondrial glutathione (GSH), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6-PD) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was restored by resveratrol treatment with a significant decrease in mitochondrial lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl and intracellular H(2)O(2) content. Resveratrol significantly improved neurological deficits assessed by different scoring methods. Also, the brain infarct volume and brain edema were significantly reduced. Histological analysis of CA1 hippocampal region revealed that resveratrol treatment diminished intercellular and pericellular edema and glial cell infiltration. The findings of this study highlight the ability of resveratrol in anatomical and functional preservation of ischemic neurovascular units and its relevance in the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Cysticercosis, the infestation with the encysted larval stage of Taenia solium, is increasingly recognized as a major problem in most countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, involving mainly the central nervous system. Muscle involvement is also common, although it usually remains asymptomatic. We describe a case of disseminated muscular cysticercosis followed by myositis (fever, diffuse myalgia, weakness of the lower limbs, and inflammatory reaction around dying cysticerci) induced by praziquantel therapy, an event not described previously.
Spontaneous allograft rupture after kidney transplantation is a rare complication usually due to an acute rejection of the interstitial type. In a 32-year-old man kidney transplantation was performed under immunosuppression with prednisolone and ciclosporin (CS). The dose of CS was 5 mg/kg body weight intravenously for the first 24 h, on the 2nd day 10 mg/kg/day orally, with gradually decreasing doses thereafter. The patient remained oliguric in the postoperative period and received additionally 600 ml mannitol solution intravenously for osmodiuresis within a period of 6 days. On the 8th postoperative day, 48 h after the last intravenous infusion of mannitol, spontaneous renal rupture occurred. The CS concentrations in the blood during the days before the rupture were within the upper normal range for effective immunosuppression (300-600 ng/ml). Intraoperatively the kidney appeared enlarged due to edematous swelling of the graft, but it showed no signs of rejection. The histological finding was a toxic tubulopathy with extensive isometric vacuolization and peritubular congestion, a known side effect of both of CS and of mannitol. The rupture was successfully repaired. Thirty-four days after the transplantation diuresis increased and hemodialysis therapy could be discontinued. In a second biopsy of the kidney the signs of toxic tubulopathy with isometric vacuolization were reduced. On the following days the serum creatinine dropped below 160 mumol/l. It can be assumed that the combination of CS therapy and administration of massive and continued doses of mannitol in an oliguric patient with allograft kidney may potentiate severe tubulopathy with concomitant edematous swelling of the graft. This can result in an increasing danger of spontaneous renal rupture.
Metabolic balance and morphologic studies were performed on rats receiving gentamicin 100 mg/kg/day for a period of 8--10 days and during the recovery period. Daily urine flow rate increased with the administration of gentamiccin and remained elevated up to 20 days following the discontinuation of gentamicin, although BUN and plasma creatinine were virtually normal 10 days after the discontinuation of gentamicin. During the development of renal failure means daily electrolyte excretion remained normal. During the recovery period, however, sodium and potassium excretion exceeded control values while chloride and net acid excretion remained normal. Proteinuria developed during the administration of gentamicin and returned to normal 6--10 days after the discontinuation of gentamicin. Ten days of netilmicin administration (150 mg/kg/day) resulted in only mild tubular degeneration and no azotemia.
Intraspinal hemorrhage is a rare but dangerous complication of anticoagulant therapy. It must be suspected in any patient taking anticoagulant agents who complains of local or referred spinal pain associated with limb weakness, sensory deficits, or urinary retention. We describe a patient with hematomyelia, review the literature on hematomyelia and other intraspinal hemorrhage syndromes, and summarize intraspinal hemorrhage associated with oral anticoagulant therapy. The patient (a 62-year-old man) resembled previously described patients with hematomyelia in age and sex. However, he was unusual in having cervical rather than thoracic localization. As with intracranial bleeding, the incidence of intraspinal hemorrhage associated with anticoagulant therapy might be minimized by close monitoring and tight control of the intensity of anticoagulation. However, it is noteworthy that many of the reported cases were anticoagulated in the therapeutic range. If intraspinal hemorrhage is suspected, anticoagulation must be reversed immediately. Emergency laminectomy and decompression of the spinal cord appear mandatory if permanent neurologic sequelae are to be minimized. A high index of suspicion, prompt recognition, and immediate intervention are essential to prevent major morbidity and mortality from intraspinal hemorrhage.
The influence of some neuroleptic, adreno, sympatho- and cholinolytic substances on the development of experimental brain edema induced with nicotine was studied in tests conducted on rats. It was ascertained that marked antiedemic properties display drugs blocking the alpha-adrenoreceptors (phentolamine, dopegit), the neuroleptic chlorpromazine and central M-cholinolytics (benactizine). Weak action exert central H-cholinolytics (difacil trasentin) and the neuroleptic galoperidol. Sympatho- and beta-adrenolytics (guanethidine, alpha-methyltyrosine, obsidan), and also the neuroleptic triphthazine fail to prevent the development of an experimental brain edema. It is presumed that a brain edema induced with nicotine comes as a result of the catecholamines liberation and is also due to stimulation of alpha-adrenoreactive systems.
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of cadmium on some protein digestive and absorption enzymes in rats. Thirty-six rats were grouped into three groups of 12 animals each; one group received deionised water and acted as control. One group received 445 microM Cd and the last group received 890 microM Cd in their drinking water for a period of one month. The results obtained indicate that increasing the level of cadmium from 445 microM to 890 microM in the drinking water of the rats led to 29% and 23% increase in accumulated cadmium in the proximal and distal small intestine respectively. The body weight gain of rats exposed to 445 microM and 890 microM Cd was decreased by about 24% and 43% respectively when compared with the control. The activities of carboxypeptidase A, dipeptidase and Na+/K+ ATPase were reduced in the mucosa of the proximal end of the small intestine of cadmium exposed rats. The reduction was dose dependent; with the 890 microM Cd exposed rats displaying the least activities. In the distal small intestine, the activities of these enzymes were restored in the 445 microM Cd exposed rats to levels that were not statistically different (P > 0.05) from those observed in the controls. In the 890 microM Cd exposed rats, dipeptidase activity improved by about 80% compared with the activity of the enzyme in the proximal small intestine. Likewise, Na+/K+ ATPase activity increased by about 125% compared with the observed level in the proximal small intestine. The study suggests that cadmium given to rats in drinking water compromise protein digestion and absorption of nutrients particularly in the proximal region of small intestine and could account for weight reduction associated with cadmium toxicity.
Eleven cases of hepatic injury attributed to the intake of flucloxacillin were reported to the Netherlands Center for Monitoring of Adverse Reactions to Drugs between 1982 and 1992. They concerned four men and seven women, with a mean age of 57 years, treated for 2-28 days with an oral dose varying from 1500-4000 mg per day. Symptoms mostly appeared 10 to 30 days after starting treatment with flucloxacillin. Biochemically, the pattern was compatible with cholestatic hepatitis in seven cases, with a mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular type of injury in one case, a hepatocellular pattern in two cases, and mild liver enzyme elevations in one patient. Two patients died, one due to fatal bleeding from the liver after biopsy, and the second patient to a combination of hepatic and cardiac failure. The other patients recovered, on average 72 days after peaking of serum aminotransferase values. Histology in seven cases showed cholestatic hepatitis in five, with cholangitis or cholangiolitis in four of these patients. In the other two patients, there was centrilobular cholestasis with extensive bridging fibrosis and portal-central bridging necrosis, respectively.
Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a group of commonly inherited defects of dental enamel formation, which exhibits marked genetic and clinical heterogeneity. The genetic basis of this heterogeneity is still poorly understood. Enamelin, the affected gene product in one form of AI (AIH2), is an extracellular matrix protein that is one of the components of enamel. We isolated three ENU-induced dominant mouse mutations, M100395, M100514 and M100521, which caused AI-like phenotypes in the incisors and molars of the affected individuals. Linkage analyses mapped each of the three mutations to a region of chromosome 5 that contained the genes encoding enamelin (Enam) and ameloblastin (Ambn). Sequence analysis revealed that each mutation was a single-base substitution in Enam. M100395 (Enam(Rgsc395)) and M100514 (Enam(Rgsc514)) were putative missense mutations that caused S to I and E to G substitutions at positions 55 and 57 of the translated protein, respectively. Enam(Rgsc395) and Enam(Rgsc514) heterozygotes showed severe breakage of the enamel surface, a phenotype that resembled local hypoplastic AI. The M100521 mutation (Enam(Rgsc521)) was a T to A substitution at the splicing donor site in intron 4. This mutation resulted in a frameshift that gave rise to a premature stop codon. The transcript of the Enam(Rgsc521) mutant allele was degraded, indicating that Enam(Rgsc521) is a loss-of-function mutation. Enam(Rgsc521) heterozygotes showed a hypomaturation-type AI phenotype in the incisors, possibly due to haploinsufficiency of Enam. Enam(Rgsc521) homozygotes showed complete loss of enamel on the incisors and the molars. Thus, we report here that the Enam gene is essential for amelogenesis, and that mice with different point mutations at Enam may provide good animal models to study the different clinical subtypes of AI.
We previously reported that the sustained exposure of human urothelial cells (HUCs) to low-dose sodium arsenite induces changes in the gene expression profile and neoplastic transformation. In this study, we used the HumanMethylation27 BeadChip to analyze genome-wide methylation profiles and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to examine the involvement of promoter methylation in gene expression. Because the expression of lipocalin-2 (LCN2) was highly enhanced by promoter hypomethylation in inorganic arsenic (iAs)-HUCs cells as well as bladder cancer tissues, we further showed that mutations at the binding sequences for NF-ÎºB and C/EBP-Î± significantly reduced LCN2 promoter activity. By chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated the significantly increased binding of RelA (p65) and NF-ÎºB1 (p50) to the hypomethylated promoter of LCN2 in the iAs-HUCs. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that LCN2 overexpression was crucial for the neoplastic characteristics of the iAs-HUCs, such as enhanced anchorage-independent growth, resistance to serum deprivation and activation of NF-ÎºB signaling. In addition, our results indicated that enhanced NF-ÎºB activity in iAs-HUCs was via LCN2-mediated increase in intracellular iron and reactive oxygen species levels. Taken together, our results show that sustained low-dose arsenic exposure results in epigenetic changes and enhanced oncogenic potential via LCN2 overexpression.
Tea polyphenols have been shown to protect against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury, liver fibrosis, hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this study, we examined the effect of tea polyphenols on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury, and explored its mechanisms.
Sprague-Dawley rats received tea polyphenols (100 mg.kg-1.d-1) or vehicle (water) intragastrically by gavage for 14 days, followed by LPS (5 mg/kg) or saline injection intraperitoneally. Liver injury was assessed by biochemical assay and pathological analysis. Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were determined. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein and TNF-alpha, iNOS and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA expressions in the liver were detected by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively.
Administration of LPS resulted in liver injury in rats, evidenced by elevated activities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hepatocellular necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration in the liver. These responses were associated with increased serum TNF-alpha levels, induced iNOS protein, expressions of TNF-alpha, iNOS mRNA in the liver and elevated lipid peroxidation at 90 minutes or 6 hours after LPS injection. Pretreatment with tea polyphenols attenuated LPS-induced liver injury, and blunted the rises of serum TNF-alpha levels and lipid peroxidation and the induction of expressions of TNF-alpha, iNOS in the liver.
Tea polyphenols prevent LPS-induced liver injury, and the mechanisms may involve the reduction of serum TNF-alpha levels and lipid peroxidation and the suppression of TNF-alpha, iNOS expressions in the liver.
OCI-5, the rat homologene of human glypican 3 (GPC3), is confirmed upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study was undertaken to detect gene expression change of OCI-5 during occurrence and progression of rat HCC.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given diethylnitrosamine (DENA) to induce HCC. Three DENA-induced rats and one control rat were sacrificed every week for 18 weeks during the development of HCC. Tissues specimens were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was isolated. Sk-Hep1 cells were treated with DENA at different concentrations. The gene expression levels of OCI-5 and GPC3 were detected with the RT-PCR method.
OCI-5 was not expressed in normal rat liver tissues. When HCC occurred and aggravated, OCI-5 expression was gradually elevated to a very high level. GPC3 was not expressed in the DENA-treated Sk-Hep1 cells.
OCI-5 was not expressed in normal rat liver tissues but in rat HCC tissues. High-expression of OCI-5 in DENA-induced rat HCC model was the gene expression change of HCC not the DENA-induced gene expression. The expression level of OCI-5 was not only elevated in rat HCC but also gradually along the occurrence and progression of HCC, indicating that GPC3 might serve as a sensitive marker of early stage HCC.
A 75-year-old woman presenting with recent onset hirsutism and severely elevated serum androgen levels was evaluated to assess the source of excessive androgen production. Commonly recommended hormonal stimulation and suppression tests, and the usually employed imaging techniques were non-diagnostic. In this report, we describe a new suppression test based on the use of the GnRH receptor antagonist, cetrorelix, to determine whether androgen production was LH-dependent. Cetrorelix, administered in a daily dose of 250 microg subcutaneously, suppressed serum LH within 24 h and reduced serum androgen levels to normal within 48-72 h, indicating that androgen overproduction was of ovarian origin. This diagnosis was confirmed by laparoscopic ovariectomy.
The cetrorelix suppression test is a simple procedure that provides valuable information regarding the source of androgen excess in postmenopausal hirsutism.
To investigate the changes of inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) and phosphodiesterase 3A in rats after myocardial infarction and to evaluate the beneficial effects of valsartan on cardiac function and ventricular remodeling. Rats were split into four groups: sham-operation group, pre-myocardial infarction group (valsartan administration 2 weeks before myocardial infarction), post-myocardial infarction group (valsartan administration after myocardial infarction) and myocardial infarction group (vehicle after myocardial infarction). Echocardiograph and hemodynamic data were measured and cardiocyte apoptosis was estimated by TUNEL staining. ICER, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), phosphodiesterase 3A and Bcl-2 mRNA expression levels were assayed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and protein expression was measured using immunoblot analysis. ICER and CREB mRNA expression in the myocardial infarction group were higher and phosphodiesterase 3A and Bcl-2 mRNA expression were lower than the sham-operation group (Ps<0.01). Following the improvement of cardiac function and ventricular remodeling, ICER and CREB mRNA in pre- and post- myocardial-infarction groups were down-regulated, and phosphodiesterase 3A and Bcl-2 mRNA were up-regulated (P<0.05). The changes brought on by valsartan pre-myocardial infarction were stronger than post-myocardial infarction (P<0.05). These data suggest that there is a phosphodiesterase 3A-ICER positive-feedback loop leading to myocyte apoptosis and ongoing development of heart failure after myocardial infarction. Maintaining the function of phosphodiesterase 3A or reducing ICER may be an effective way to prevent myocardium apoptosis and heart dysfunction. Valsartan can ameliorate ventricular remodeling and heart failure by inhibiting the expression of ICER and increasing the expression of phosphodiesterase 3A.
A phase II trial of idarubicin was performed in 24 patients with advanced lymphoma. The drug was administered in a dose of 10-15 mg/m2 i.v. or 15-70 mg/m2 p.o. (single dose) every 3 weeks. There were four partial responses and four minor responses. All but one of the responders had received prior doxorubicin therapy. The toxicities were myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, and alopecia. Two patients with compromised cardiac function were observed to have further deterioration in the ejection fraction as measured by gated cardiac scan after idarubicin therapy. Further assessment of the activity of idarubicin against lymphoma is recommended in less heavily pretreated patients. The cardiac toxicity should be carefully monitored in future studies.
The proton-pump inhibitor, lansoprazole, a more potent gastric acid inhibitor with a longer action than H2-receptor antagonists, should heal refractory gastric ulcers more effectively.
Lansoprazole's efficacy in healing refractory gastric ulcer(s) (i.e. after 6 weeks of treatment with H2-receptor antagonists, antacids or sucralfate at recommended dosages, and/or a relapse within 1 year of documented gastric ulcer), was compared by a two-dose regimen in a four-centre, randomized, parallel group study. One hundred and eighteen patients (59 per group) with an endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcer > or = 3 mm, received lansoprazole 30 or 60 mg daily. We assessed efficacy endoscopically at 4 and 8 weeks, and again after documented healing during a maintenance phase of lansoprazole 30 mg/day at 2 and 4 months.
Demographic and anthropometric data were comparable. Healing rates at 4 weeks were 63% (30 mg) vs. 66% (60 mg) (95% CI, -14 to 21%) and cumulatively at 8 weeks, 83% (30 mg) vs. 81% (60 mg) (95% CI, -12 to 16%). Two and 4 months after documented healing, 86% and 78% of intention-to-treat patients remained in remission.
Lansoprazole 30 or 60 mg/day appear equally effective in healing refractory gastric ulcers, while maintenance therapy of 30 mg/day effectively prevented an ulcer relapse.
