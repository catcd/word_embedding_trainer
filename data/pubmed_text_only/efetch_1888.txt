Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is well known to be associated with chronic gastritis and also development of gastric cancer. Raphanobrassica (RB) is an intergeneric hybrid of the genera Raphanus (radish) and Brassica (cabbages) containing appreciable amounts of glucoraphanin (GR) and glucoraphenin (GRe), which are actively hydrolyzed by the enzyme myrosinase to sulforaphane and sulforaphene, respectively. Both of these metabolites exert antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of two freeze-dried products of RB (RB1 and RB2) on H. pylori-induced gastritis in Mongolian gerbils. Six-week-old male Mongolian gerbils were inoculated orally with H. pylori (ATCC 43504), and 2weeks later were fed diets containing no additives or diets supplemented with 2% RB1 (containing both GR and GRe) or 2% RB2 (containing GR only) for 10weeks. In the RB1, but not the RB2 group, mononuclear cell infiltration, mRNA expression of IL-6, and cell proliferation in the gastric mucosa were significantly suppressed. These results indicate that RB1 containing both GR and GRe exerted significant inhibitory effects on H. pylori-induced gastritis in Mongolian gerbils apparently mediated via suppression of IL-6 expression and chronic inflammation.
Side effects of two lithium salts of the sustained-release type were compared in a cross-over double-blind study. Eighteen patients with uni- or bipolar type of manic-depressive diseases were included in the trial. The drugs compared were lithium citrate (Litarex, Dumex Ltd.) and lithium sulphate (Lithionit Durettes, HÃ¤ssle Ltd.). After the patients had been adjusted to a serum concentration of 0.8-1.2 mmol/l, self-assessment of the frequency and intensity of 16 side-effect variables was performed during a period of 4 weeks. The most common side effects were tremor, fatigue, polyuria, polydipsia, and reduced power of concentration. There was no difference in the frequency or intensity of the side effects between the two drugs. The side effects are, accordingly, considered an effect of the lithium ion, rather than of the lithium salt. The difference in the size and appearance of the tablets was of very little practical significance.
Contrast media can lead to renal impairment that results in longer hospitalization and increased mortality. Adenosine is a crucial mediator of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN; an increase in serum creatinine of >or=0.5 mg/dl within 48 hours). Therefore, it was the purpose of our study to investigate whether the adenosine antagonist theophylline reduces the incidence of CIN after coronary angiography. We also characterized risk factors for CIN after coronary angiography. One hundred patients with serum creatinine concentrations of >or=1.3 mg/dl randomly received 200 mg IV theophylline or placebo 30 minutes before coronary angiography (amount of contrast medium >or=100 ml). Patients who received theophylline and the controls were comparable with regard to baseline creatinine levels (means +/- SD) (1.65 +/- 0.41 vs 1.72 +/- 0.69 mg/dl) and the amount of contrast medium received (235 +/- 89 vs 261 +/- 139 ml). Theophylline significantly reduced the incidence of CIN (4% vs 20%, p = 0.0138). With placebo, creatinine significantly increased at 12 (1.82 +/- 0.79 mg/dl, p = 0.0057), 24 (1.90 +/- 0.86 mg/dl, p = 0.0001), and 48 hours (1.90 +/- 0.89 mg/dl, p = 0.0007) after administration of contrast medium. With pretreatment with theophylline, mean creatinine only increased 24 hours after contrast medium administration (1.70 +/- 0.40 mg/dl, p = 0.029), but was stable 12 hours (1.65 +/- 0.43 mg/dl, p = 0.99) and 48 hours after contrast medium administration (1.65 +/- 0.41 mg/dl, p = 0.99). The following parameters were significantly associated with contrast-induced renal impairment: Cigarroa quotient >5 (contrast medium [milliters] x serum creatinine/body weight [kg]), elevated troponin T, >300 ml of contrast medium, and emergency angiography. In conclusion, theophylline reduces the incidence of CIN in patients with chronic renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography. It should be used especially in patients receiving large amounts of contrast medium, and in patients with a Cigarroa quotient of >5 and/or elevated troponin T levels.
Mitoxantrone, an anthracenedione derivative structurally similar to anthracycline, was tested in 25 Phase II patients with advanced breast cancer, previously treated with different cycles of 5-fluorouracil. Cardiac toxicity was evaluated by means of electrocardiography, echocardiography and radionuclide left-ventricular ejection fraction. Ten patients received a cumulative dose less than 70 mg/m2 (median 33.6, range 28-63) and 15 a dose equal to or more than 70 mg/m2 (median 81, range 70-84). ECG abnormalities in the form of dysrhythmias and ST-T changes were observed in 41% of the patients. Echocardiographic myocardial function parameters recorded in 10 of the 15 patients who received more than 70 mg/m2 demonstrated a trend to deterioration, whereas the nuclear angiographic ejection fraction recorded in all 15 patients who had more than 70 mg/m2 had significantly decreased. No patients developed congestive heart failure but almost one-quarter of them had a fall in myocardial function parameters of more than 15% compared to pretreatment values. These data indicate that mitoxantrone has a significant toxic effect on myocardial cells also at cumulative doses of less than 85 mg/m2 which is generally considered beyond the limit of safety for patients without risk factors.
Omeprazole pellets containing mucoadhesive tablets were developed by direct punch method. Three mucoadhesive polymers namely hydroxypropylemethylcellulose K4M, sodium carboxy methylcellulose, carbopol-934P and ethyl cellulose were used for preparation of tablets which intended for prolong action may be due to the attachment with intestinal mucosa for relief from active duodenal ulcer. Mucoadhesive tablets were coated with respective polymer and coated with Eudragit L100 to fabricate enteric coated tablets. The prepared tablets were evaluated for different physical parameters and dissolution study were performed in three dissolution mediums like 0.1N hydrochloric acid for 2h, pH 6.5 and pH 7.8 phosphate buffer solution for 12hr. Sodium carboxymethylcellulose showed above 95% release within 10 h where as carbopol-934P showed slow release about 88% to 92% over a period of 12 h. having excellent mucoadhesive strength but ethyl cellulose containing tablets showed less than 65% release. The release mechanism of all formulation was diffusion controlled confirmed from Higuchi's plot. Thus, the present study concluded that, carbopol-934P containing mucoadhesive tablets of omeprazole pellets can be used for local action in the ulcer disease as well as for oral controlled release drug delivery.
Manic behavior during randomly assigned treatment with clomipramine (chlorimipramine) or amitriptyline hydrochloride developed in seven of 50 hospitalized unipolar depressed patients. Six of the 25 clomipramine-treated patients became manic. Only one patient in the amitriptyline-treated group developed manic behavior. The switch into mania occurred at the mean age of 63, much later than the reported age of risk for mania. Significant correlations were observed between the age at onset of mania, the number of days of clomipramine treatment, and the duration of the manic episode. We hypothesize that such a switch into mania in unipolar patients is triggered by the psychopharmacological effect of clomipramine through an alleged change in activity of the central dopamine and serotonin systems.
Maintenance tricyclic antidepressants induced rapid cycling between mania and depression in five female bipolar (manic-depressive) patients. Lithium carbonate did not prevent the tricyclic-induced rapid cycling, although two patients subsequently responded well to lithium carbonate alone. In these patients, the action of tricyclics can be conceptualized as accelerating rather than counteracting the natural, cyclic course of the illness in all of its phases. In this respect, tricyclics are analogous to several other drugs that are capable of modulating the frequency of oscillatory biological processes.
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGFbeta(1)) are potent peptide growth factors that are likely to play important roles in the development of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Previously we showed that TNFalpha and TGFbeta(1) are up-regulated in macrophages, epithelial and mesenchymal cells early after exposure to chrysotile asbestos, particularly at sites of fiber deposition in vivo. We also showed that TNFalpha receptor knockout mice are resistant to asbestos-induced fibrosis. Importantly, vectors that over-express TNFalpha cause inflammation and fibrogenesis along with increased TGFbeta(1) production in C57Bl/6 mice. Recently we reported that TNFalpha activates the extracellular regulated kinase pathway in fibroblasts leading to a 200-400% increase in TGFbeta(1) mRNA and protein. The mechanism of TNFalpha induction of TGFbeta(1) expression appears to be complex, involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In asbestos-exposed animals, this TGFbeta(1) is produced on alveolar surfaces in a latent form (controlled by binding of a latent associated peptide [LAP]) that must be activated for the TGFbeta(1) to bind to its receptors and induce its multiple biological effects. Thus, we recently reported that, in vitro, reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from chrysotile and crocidolite asbestos activate TGFbeta(1) by oxidation of the LAP. Now, in preliminary findings, we have shown that over-expression of latent TGFbeta(1) prior to asbestos exposure of fibrogenic-resistant TNFalpha receptor knockout mice produces asbestos lesions with the same severity as seen in normal C57/Bl6 mice. This finding plus the demonstration of increased amounts of TGFbeta(1), increased Smad activation and amelioration of the developing disease by treating the mice with an anti-oxidant all support the concept that, in vivo, latent TGFbeta(1) is activated by asbestos-generated oxygen radicals and consequently mediates at least a component of the consequent fibrogenesis. Taken together, these findings support the postulate that TNFalpha controls fibrogenesis by regulating TGFbeta(1) expression and that one mechanism through which ROS induce lung fibrosis is by activating latent TGFbeta(1).
Lithium pretreatment of rats has previously been shown to potentiate the convulsant effects of cholinomimetic drugs, such as pilocarpine. The first objective of this project was to determine if lithium also potentiates seizures induced by other classes of drugs. Lithium pretreatment of rats did not affect seizure activity induced by administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate, kainic acid, bicuculline, or pentylenetetrazole. This suggests that the proconvulsant effect of lithium is largely selective for cholinomimetics. A second series of experiments investigated possible mechanisms of the lithium potentiation of pilocarpine-induced seizures. The alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine suppressed seizure development, and the antagonist idazoxan enhanced the onset of seizures, suggesting that endogenous norepinephrine provides anticonvulsant properties. Administration of the norepinephrine depleter DSP-4 potentiated pilocarpine-induced seizures. These results suggest that the previously reported impairment of noradrenergic function by lithium may play a role in its potentiation of cholinomimetic-induced seizures.
Diclofenac (DCF) is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug implicated as a cause of immune hemolytic anemia. Drug derivatives have been suggested to be an important-or probably the primary-immunizing agent in drug-induced immune reactions. A systematic evaluation of 12 patients with DCF-induced immune hemolysis is reported.
All sera samples were evaluated with standard serologic tests for the detection of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelet (PLT) antibodies in the presence of DCF, DCF-urine (DCF-U), and five chemically defined metabolites.
Twelve patients' sera samples reacted with DCF-U, but only 9 reacted with DCF. When derivatives were tested, no metabolite was recognized by all sera samples (although 4'-OH-DCF was recognized by 11/12), and no metabolite remained unrecognized. As demonstrated with Rh(null) cells, the Rh complex may represent an important, but not the only, target protein for which drug-dependent antibodies are specific. PLT-reactive antibodies were not detectable.
There is evidence that patients with DCF-induced immune hemolysis produce a broad spectrum of anti-DCF/RBC antibodies. 4'-OH-DCF seems to represent the most immunogenic metabolite. Nevertheless, all patients' sera samples contain a mixture of antibodies that recognize several and distinguishable epitopes. These epitopes consist of different drug metabolites and a target protein on the RBC surface, which appears to be the Rh complex in many, but not in all, cases. Additional target proteins remain to be identified.
Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) is uniquely characterized by macroscopic bone marrow stromal changes that are believed to be both reactive and cytokine mediated. Furthermore, a prognostically detrimental increase in bone marrow angiogenesis has recently been demonstrated. These observations suggest a potential therapeutic role for agents that are inhibitory to angiogenesis as well as cytokines that are pathogenetically implicated in MMM. In a prospective study of 15 patients with MMM, thalidomide treatment, starting at a dose of 200 mg/d, resulted in increased platelet counts (12 of 15 patients), increased haemoglobin level (3 of 15), a modest decrease in spleen size (3 of 12), increased bone marrow megakaryopoiesis (5 of 9) and decreased bone marrow angiogenesis (2 of 9). Undesirable haematological effects included pericardial extramedullary haematopoiesis in one patient, marked leucocytosis in two patients and extreme thrombocytosis in three patients. The thrombocytosis occurred in both patients with post-thrombocythaemic myeloid metaplasia (PTMM) and was also associated with higher baseline levels of circulating CD34+ cells. Previously described toxicities of thalidomide were seen in the majority of patients and dose escalation to 400 mg/d was permitted in only two patients. In contrast, toxicity-related dose reductions to 50 mg/d did not appear to lessen drug efficacy. We conclude that thalidomide has both beneficial and potentially adverse biological activity in MMM. A lower dose of the drug might be more tolerable without compromising therapeutic value. Patients with PTMM and/or markedly increased circulating CD34+ cell counts might be susceptible to thalidomide-induced thrombocytosis.
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) affects monoamine neurotransmitters that play a critical role in sleep and daytime alertness. However, the acute effects of MDMA on sleep and daytime sleepiness have not been studied under placebo-controlled conditions. This study was designed to establish the effects of acute MDMA or placebo administration and sleep restriction on sleep and daytime sleepiness.
Participants with a history of MDMA use were studied on 3 sessions of 3 nights (baseline, treatment, and recovery) and 2 days (following night 2 and 3) per session. On treatment nights (night 2), participants received placebo or 2 mg/kg of MDMA or underwent a restricted bed schedule with placebo. Sleep restriction was a positive control to compare sleep loss and consequent sleepiness associated with MDMA use. The scheduled sleep period was 8 hours long on nonrestricted nights, and standard sleep recordings and daytime sleepiness tests were conducted. Age-matched controls received 1 night and day of standard sleep and daytime sleepiness testing.
Sleep laboratory.
Seven recreational MDMA-users and 13 matched control subjects.
Acute MDMA shortened sleep primarily by increasing sleep latency, and it reduced stage 3/4 sleep and suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The MDMA-reduced sleep time was not associated with increased daytime sleepiness the following day, as was seen in the sleep-restriction condition. Compared with control subjects, the MDMA users on the first night in the laboratory had shorter total sleep times and less stage 3/4 sleep. Average daily sleep latency on daytime sleepiness tests the day after nighttime placebo administration was increased in MDMA users compared with the control subjects, and MDMA users had an elevated number of sleep-onset REM periods on these tests, compared with control subjects.
Acute MDMA administration disrupts sleep and REM sleep, specifically, without producing daytime sleepiness such as sleep restriction does. Compared with control subjects, recreational MDMA users showed evidence of hyperarousal and impaired REM function. The mechanism behind these effects is likely due to the deleterious effects of MDMA on catecholamines.
The emergence of tics in children treated with stimulant medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was investigated. A retrospective chart review of the medical records of 555 subjects was performed to examine the emergence of tics in relation to treatment with a stimulant medication, dosage, duration of treatment, and age of subjects. A total of 7.8% of the subjects treated with stimulants developed tics: 8.3% of subjects treated with methylphenidate, 6.3% with dextroamphetamine, and 7.7% with pemoline. The subjects who developed tics were significantly younger than those who did not. Subjects treated with higher doses of stimulant medication were not more likely to develop tics. While the emergence of tics was common, these subjects may have developed tics irrespective of stimulant medication. Controversy remains as to the long-term risk of tics in relation to stimulant medication and to appropriate practice should tics emerge during the course of stimulant medication treatment.
Liver diseases associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have become the major cause of mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection since the introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy. HCV-related liver disease is more severe in HIV-infected patients than in non-HIV-infected patients, but the standard therapies used to treat chronic hepatitis C in HCV/HIV coinfected patients are the same as those for patients infected with HCV alone. HIV protease inhibitors might have potential to down-regulate HCV load of HCV/HIV coinfected patients. In this study, we evaluated the effects of nelfinavir on intracellular HCV replication using the HCV replicon system. We constructed an HCV replicon expressing a neomycin-selectable chimeric firefly luciferase reporter protein. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by nelfinavir were assessed and synergism between nelfinavir and interferon (IFN) was calculated using CalcuSyn analysis. Nelfinavir dose-dependently repressed HCV replication at low concentrations (IC(50), 9.88 micromol/L). Nelfinavir failed to induce cytotoxicity or apoptosis at concentrations that inhibited HCV replication. Clinical concentrations of nelfinavir (5 micromol/L) combined with IFN showed synergistic inhibition of HCV replication in our replicon model. Our results suggest that the direct effects of nelfinavir on the HCV subgenome and its synergism with IFN could improve clinical responses to IFN therapy in HCV/HIV coinfected patients.
Bimoclomol (BIM), is a stress proteins coinducer, that acts synergistically with a mild stressor to activate cytoprotective stress proteins. BIM has been successfully utilized in animal models for the treatment of various nervous, cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases. Mercuric chloride (HgCl(2)) induces acute renal failure in rats by a single dosage. The present in vivo study was conducted to assess the efficacy of BIM against acute HgCl(2) nephrotoxicity. At different times after BIM and/or HgCl(2) exposure we evaluated renal morphology and the localization/abundance of three stress proteins (HSP72, GRP75, HSP60) by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. BIM delivery to rats 6h before mercury, ameliorated damage to renal ultrastructure, with recovery of tubular and mitochondrial membranes 24h after mercury treatment. In rats pretreated with BIM prior to HgCl(2) exposure, HSP72 was significantly overexpressed in proximal tubules in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, the amounts of GRP75 and HSP60 after BIM pretreatment were comparable to the group treated with mercury alone, but these stress proteins had translocated to the nuclei at 14 and 24h, respectively. These novel findings suggest that BIM mitigates HgCl(2) nephrotoxicity in rats through the early recruitment of stress proteins in midcortical proximal tubules that are the main renal mercury-targets.
Descending facilitation, from the brainstem, promotes spinal neuronal hyperexcitability and behavioural hypersensitivity in many chronic pain states. We have previously demonstrated enhanced descending facilitation onto dorsal horn neurones in a neuropathic pain model, and shown this to enable the analgesic effectiveness of gabapentin. Here we have tested if this hypothesis applies to other pain states by using a combination of approaches in a rat model of osteoarthritis (OA) to ascertain if 1) a role for descending 5HT mediated facilitation exists, and 2) if pregabalin (a newer analogue of gabapentin) is an effective antinociceptive agent in this model. Further, quantitative-PCR experiments were undertaken to analyse the alpha 2 delta-1 and 5-HT3A subunit mRNA levels in L3-6 DRG in order to assess whether changes in these molecular substrates have a bearing on the pharmacological effects of ondansetron and pregabalin in OA.
Osteoarthritis was induced via intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into the knee joint. Control animals were injected with 0.9% saline. Two weeks later in vivo electrophysiology was performed, comparing the effects of spinal ondansetron (10-100 microg/50 microl) or systemic pregabalin (0.3 - 10 mg/kg) on evoked responses of dorsal horn neurones to electrical, mechanical and thermal stimuli in MIA or control rats. In MIA rats, ondansetron significantly inhibited the evoked responses to both innocuous and noxious natural evoked neuronal responses, whereas only inhibition of noxious evoked responses was seen in controls. Pregabalin significantly inhibited neuronal responses in the MIA rats only; this effect was blocked by a pre-administration of spinal ondansetron. Analysis of alpha 2 delta-1 and 5-HT3A subunit mRNA levels in L3-6 DRG revealed a significant increase in alpha 2 delta-1 levels in ipsilateral L3&4 DRG in MIA rats. 5-HT3A subunit mRNA levels were unchanged.
These data suggest descending serotonergic facilitation plays a role in mediating the brush and innocuous mechanical punctate evoked neuronal responses in MIA rats, suggesting an adaptive change in the excitatory serotonergic drive modulating low threshold evoked neuronal responses in MIA-induced OA pain. This alteration in excitatory serotonergic drive, alongside an increase in alpha 2 delta-1 mRNA levels, may underlie pregabalin's state dependent effects in this model of chronic pain.
A 64-year-old man developed progressive dementia and altered consciousness with myoclonus over 2 months. Neurological examination revealed mild dysphagia and negative myoclonus of both hands. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed continuous periodic synchronous discharge (PSD) of 1 Hz, although his EEG abnormality was not similar to that usually observed in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed only few lacunes. Laboratory data were also normal. Since his consciousness level fluctuated and the PSD were spiky, we came to a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). After administering the valproic acid, his symptoms and EEG finding improved. Nine months after the onset, despite his continued valproic acid, the patient had recurrent NCSE and PSD of 1 Hz. Diffusion-weighted MRI showed a T2-hyperintense lesion in the right parietal lobe, where SPECT scans showed hyperperfusion. After adding zonisamide, he improved slowly. The follow-up MRI and SPECT showed a disappearance of the previous lesion. Now CT scans of the abdomen showed enlarged periaortic lymph node and endoscopic ultrasonography disclosed a submucosal tumor of the stomach. Biopsy of the periaortic lymph node by laparotomy revealed undifferentiated adenocarcinoma with its origin being unclear. Chemotherapy didn't work well for the tumor and the patient underwent a downhill course, although his mental and neurological manifestation were mostly unremarkable. Two years and four months after the onset, he died in emaciation. Autopsy confirmed small cell carcinoma originating in the stomach and metastases in the liver and lungs. Neuropathological examination revealed only mild scattered gliosis. This case was unique in the prolonged CJD-like manifestations, which turned out to be due to NCSE. Despite anti-neuronal antibodies were not detected, we suspect yet another paraneoplastic brain syndrome in this patient.
Psychosis characterized by hallucination or delusion, which occurs during drug therapy of parkinsonian patients, is one of the limiting factors for the control of motor symptoms or complications. In the present study, we encountered three patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) at advanced stages; all three patients had severe psychosis and severe wearing-off phenomenon and one had severe orthostatic hypotension. Their psychotic symptoms were successfully treated by administration of quetiapine, resulting in the favorable control of motor fluctuations and elevation of therapeutic levels unless any aggravation of parkinsonism occurs. Although the measure against drug-induced psychosis is principally a reduction of the doses or withdrawal of causative drugs, the effective use of antipsychotic drugs, such as quetiapine, is helpful to suppress psychosis and allow the patient to adjust to antiparkinsonian drugs for the control of symptoms other than psychosis.
Unenhanced helical computed tomography has played an increasingly important role in the management of urinary tract stones, guiding diagnosis and control of calculus disease. We report computed tomographic and radiographic appearances of a renal calculus composed of pseudoephedrine and guaifenesin in a patient who abused over-the-counter allergy medication.
A 27 year old man with Hodgkin's disease experienced three separate episodes of chest pain, each occurring on the sixth day of a cycle of mustargen, oncovin, procarbazine, prednisone (MOPP) combination chermotherapy. The first episode appeared to represent a myocardial infarction, whereas the next two were less serious. Numerous studies were performed including coronary angiography, cardiac catheterization and open pericardial biopsy. It is suggested that the patient represents an example of a previously undescribed syndrome due to chemotherapy administered after cardiac irradiation.
In an attempt to test the possibility that sino-aortic baroreceptors may mediate the previously reported stress response in hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory cell activity in rats, effects of deafferentation of sino-aortic baroreceptors on plasma levels of vasopressin and oxytocin after fear-related emotional stress were studied in male rats 28-33 days after the surgery. An alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine (1 mg/kg) injected i.p. under anesthesia increased arterial blood pressure in the rats that had received surgical operation of sino-aortic denervation (SAD) and in the rats of sham-operation control (SHAM). Reflex bradycardia after phenylephrine occurred in the SHAM but not in the SAD group. These results indicate that afferent signals originating from sino-aortic baroreceptors were effectively blocked by the SAD surgery. In the similarly prepared SAD group, plasma level of vasopressin was decreased and plasma level of oxytocin was increased significantly to the same extent as in the SHAM group after low-frequency shocks (0.05 Hz, 5 min) or environmental cue signals previously paired with shocks. It is therefore suggested that afferent neural signals originating from sino-aortic baroreceptors are not primarily involved in the suppressive vasopressin or the facilitatory oxytocin response to fear-related emotional stress in rats.
Tetrindole (a tetracyclic antidepressant, reversible MAO inhibitor of the A type) and desipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant, nonselective inhibitor of the reverse catecholamine trapping) produce opposite hemodynamic effects in stroke-prone hypertensive rats (SHR-SP): tetrindole reduced, whereas desipramine increased, the heart rate and arterial pressure. Under the acute immobilization stress conditions in SHR-SP, tetrindole inhibited development of the post-stressor tachycardia, while desipramine did not change the heart rate and increased the arterial pressure.
