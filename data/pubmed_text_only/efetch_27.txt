Fenfluramine is a recently introduced anorexigenic drug for the treatment of obesity. 5 cases of hypertension induced or aggravated by fenfluramine are described. They include 4 females and one male seen and followed in the Hypertension Clinic of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. Even though there was loss of weight while they were on fenfluramine there was a rise in blood pressure in 4 of them despite concurrent therapy with antihypertensive agents. In one female patient the rise in blood pressure occurred while on self-medication with the drug alone. In all of them the blood pressure fell when fenfluramine was stopped. Although there have been many reports of the effectiveness in the treatment of obesity, reports of its adverse reactions have been few and there has been no mention of hypertension. The drug brochure warns that hypotension may even occur. In view of the present case reports it is advisable that those who are on fenfluramine should have their blood pressure checked regularly particularly if they are also known to be hypertensive.
The production of lung adenomas in strain A mice following multiple injections of 17 alkyl halides and of 3 base analogs was investigated. A slight but significant increase in the average number of lung tumors per mouse was noted following the administration of methyl iodide, n- and i-propyl iodide, sec- and tert-butyl chloride, i-, sec-, and tert-butyl bromide, and n- and sec-butyl iodide. The administration of comparable doses of ethyl bromide, ethyl iodide, n-butyl chloride, benzyl chloride, and 1-chloromethylnaphthalene to mice resulted in no significant increase in the frequency of lung tumors over that seen in vehicle-treated control mice. n-Butyl bromide and tert-butyl iodide similarly appeared to have no significant effect on the lung tumor frequency, but these compounds were too toxic to be tested at the high dosages used with the other alkyl halides. 5-Iodo-, 5-bromo-, and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine also appeared to have no significant effect on the lung tumor frequency. These results indicate that a high proportion of low-molecular-weight alkyl halides may be weakly carcinogenic and provide evidence supporting an electrophilic hypothesis of carcinogenesis.
Achromatopsia is an autosomal recessively inherited visual disorder that is present from birth and that features the absence of color discrimination. We here report the identification of five independent families with achromatopsia that segregate protein-truncation mutations in the GNAT2 gene, located on chromosome 1p13. GNAT2 encodes the cone photoreceptor-specific alpha-subunit of transducin, a G-protein of the phototransduction cascade, which couples to the visual pigment(s). Our results demonstrate that GNAT2 is the third gene implicated in achromatopsia.
A single exposure to cocaine rapidly induces the brief activation of several immediate early genes, but the role of such short-term regulation in the enduring consequences of cocaine use is poorly understood. We found that 4 h of intravenous cocaine self-administration in rats induced a transient increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of TrkB-mediated signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Augmenting this dynamic regulation with five daily NAc BDNF infusions caused enduring increases in cocaine self-administration, and facilitated relapse to cocaine seeking in withdrawal. In contrast, neutralizing endogenous BDNF regulation with intra-NAc infusions of antibody to BDNF subsequently reduced cocaine self-administration and attenuated relapse. Using localized inducible BDNF knockout in mice, we found that BDNF originating from NAc neurons was necessary for maintaining increased cocaine self-administration. These findings suggest that dynamic induction and release of BDNF from NAc neurons during cocaine use promotes the development and persistence of addictive behavior.
Flavopiridol, a synthetic flavone that inhibits cell cycle progression, has demonstrated activity in colon cancer in xenografts and in a phase I trial. We evaluated flavopiridol in a phase II trial in patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer (ACRC).
Twenty chemotherapy-naïve patients with ACRC received flavopiridol at a dose of 50 mg/m(2)/day via a 72-h continuous infusion every 14 days. Response was assessed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging every 8 weeks.
Twenty patients were enrolled; 19 were evaluable for toxicity and 18 for response. There were no objective responses. Five patients had stable disease lasting a median of 7 weeks. The median time to progression was 8 weeks. Median survival was 65 weeks. The principal grade 3/4 toxicities were diarrhea, fatigue and hyperglycemia, occurring in 21%, 11% and 11% of patients, respectively. Other common toxicities included anemia, anorexia and nausea/vomiting.
Flavopiridol in this dose and schedule does not have single-agent activity in patients with ACRC. Recent preclinical data suggest that flavopiridol enhances apoptosis when combined with chemotherapy. Trials that evaluate flavopiridol in combination with active cytotoxic drugs should help to define the role of this novel agent in ACRC.
Electrocorticographic (ECoG) and depth recordings have previously demonstrated the epileptogenic nature of surgical concentrations of the volatile anesthetic enflurane. We contrasted ECoG activity with local cerebral glucose uptake [( 14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography) in 23 brain structures in order to identify the epileptogenic foci. Autoradiograms were obtained from sectioned rat brain following a 30 min period of steady-state anesthesia at 1, 1.5, or 2 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) enflurane. Pseudo-epileptiform ECoGs were obtained at 1 MAC where bursts of slow waves and sharp waves were evoked by peripheral sensory stimulation. At 1.5 MAC, the ECoG displayed frank, spontaneous epileptiform activity with large amplitude spike-wave complexes; repetitive auditory stimulation occasionally precipitated grand-mal seizures. At 2 MAC, spike complexes were less frequent and could not be repetitively driven. At 1 MAC enflurane, regional cerebral metabolism was generally depressed approximately 14% from the awake controls. However, metabolism in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and other subcortical structures in the limbic brain was increased. At 1.5 MAC this dichotomy in local cerebral metabolic rate was maximal; we observed increased metabolism in the hippocampus, habenula, habenulo-interpeduncular tract and interpeduncular nucleus and pineal. Metabolism in all other structures was significantly depressed (P less than 0.05) compared to awake values. At 2 MAC, metabolism was decreased in all structures. We conclude that the low seizure threshold hippocampus and related structures associated with the limbic system and its pathways are the epileptogenic foci for seizures induced with enflurane in the rat. At 1.5 MAC, epileptiform activity spreads throughout the visceral brain when seizure threshold is at a minimum.
Nephronophthisis (NPHP), an autosomal recessive kidney disease, is the most frequent genetic cause of end-stage renal failure in the first three decades of life. Positional cloning of the six known NPHP genes has linked its pathogenesis to primary cilia function. Here we identify mutation of GLIS2 as causing an NPHP-like phenotype in humans and mice, using positional cloning and mouse transgenics, respectively. Kidneys of Glis2 mutant mice show severe renal atrophy and fibrosis starting at 8 weeks of age. Differential gene expression studies on Glis2 mutant kidneys demonstrate that genes promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis are upregulated in the absence of Glis2. Thus, we identify Glis2 as a transcription factor mutated in NPHP and demonstrate its essential role for the maintenance of renal tissue architecture through prevention of apoptosis and fibrosis.
The present study demonstrates changes in rat brain glial metabolism during the acute phase of epilepsy. Status epilepticus (SE) was induced using the lithium-pilocarpine model. Glial metabolism was measured with (14)C-acetate. Local cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism were also measured using (14)C-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) and (14)C-2-deoxyglucose (2DG), respectively. At the initiation of the seizure, (14)C-acetate uptake did not change significantly. However, a marked increase was observed 2 h after the pilocarpine injection in all brain regions studied. The increase of brain uptake was transient, and the maximum enhancement was seen at 2 h after the pilocarpine injection. The increase of (14)C-acetate uptake was almost to the same degree in all regions, whereas (14)C-IMP and (14)C-2DG uptakes showed a heterogeneous increase. In the case of (14)C-IMP, the highest increase was observed in the thalamus (280%), and a moderate increase (120 to 150%) was seen in the orbital cortex, cingulate cortex and pyriform cortex. (14)C-2DG uptake increased by 130 to 240% in most regions of the brain, however, an increase of only 40 and 20% was observed in the cerebellum and pons-medulla, respectively. These results demonstrated that glial energy metabolism was markedly enhanced during a prolonged seizure. To our knowledge, this study is the first observation showing large and widespread glial metabolic increases in the rat brain during status epilepticus.
Renal proximal tubular damage and repair are hallmarks of acute kidney injury. As glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) is an important cellular regulator of survival and proliferation, we determined its role during injury and recovery of proximal tubules in a mercuric chloride-induced nephrotoxic model of acute kidney injury. Renal proximal tubule-specific GSK3β knockout mice exposed to mercuric chloride had improved survival and renal function compared to wild-type mice. Apoptosis, measured by TUNEL staining, Bax activation, and caspase 3 cleavage, was reduced in the knockout mice. The restoration of renal structure, function, and cell proliferation was also accelerated in the GSK3β knockout mice. This enhanced repair, evidenced by increased Ki-67 and BRDU staining, along with increased cyclin D1 and c-myc levels, was recapitulated by treatment of wild-type mice with the small-molecule GSK3 inhibitor TDZD-8 following injury. This confirmed that hastened repair in the knockout mice was not merely due to lower initial injury levels. Thus, inhibition of GSK3β prior to nephrotoxic insult protects from renal injury. Such treatment after acute kidney injury may accelerate repair and regeneration.
An 11-month-old boy with multiple congenital anomalies developed West syndrome and ACTH therapy was started. Marked bradycardia during sleep was observed after the 16th day of ACTH therapy. Echocardiography revealed both intraventricular septum and left ventricular free wall thickening with preservation of biventricular function. Both the patient's marked sinus dysfunction and his cardiac hypertrophy were suspected to be related to the ACTH therapy. Sinus function gradually improved after ACTH therapy was withdrawn and treatment with oral beta-agonist was started. We believe that the patient's sinus dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy were caused by ACTH treatment because of the subacute nature of the onset and the absence of other potentially contributory factors such as infection or respiratory failure. Pediatricians should be aware that cardiac dysfunction could be associated with ACTH therapy for West syndrome.
Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is a widely used industrial plasticizer to which humans are widely exposed. We investigated the consequences of maternal exposure to DEHP on nephron formation, examined the programming of renal function and blood pressure and explored the mechanism in offspring. Maternal rats were treated with vehicle, 0.25 and 6.25mg/kg body weight/day DEHP respectively from gestation day 0 to postnatal day 21. Maternal DEHP exposure resulted in lower number of nephrons, higher glomerular volume and smaller Bowman's capsule in the DEHP-treated offspring at weaning, as well as glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and effacement of podocyte foot processes in adulthood. In the DEHP-treated offspring, the renal function was lower and the blood pressure was higher. The renal protein expression of renin and angiotensin II was reduced at birth day and increased at weaning. Maternal DEHP exposure also led to reduced mRNA expression of some renal development involved genes at birth day, including Foxd1, Gdnf, Pax2 and Wnt11. While, the mRNA expression of some genes was raised, including Bmp4, Cdh11, Calm1 and Ywhab. These data show that maternal DEHP exposure impairs the offspring renal development, resulting in a nephron deficit, and subsequently elevated blood pressure later in life. Our findings suggest that DEHP exposure in developmental periods may affect the development of nephrons and adult renal disease through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.
The ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, a highly selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, was compared with that of timolol 0.5%, a nonselective beta-blocker in two multicenter, randomized, double-masked studies. Combined data from a 12-month completed study and 6-month interim data from an ongoing study are reported. Efficacy and safety were evaluated at baseline, weeks 1 and 2, and months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at peak (2 hours after the morning dose) and trough (12 hours after the evening dose). Patients (n = 926) instilled either brimonidine tartrate 0.2% or timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily. At peak, the mean decreases from baseline IOP ranged from 5.9 +/- 3.2 mm Hg to 7.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg for brimonidine and 6.0 +/- 3.4 mm Hg to 6.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg for timolol (p < 0.001 within groups compared with baseline). No significant between-group differences were seen at peak except for weeks 1 and 2 and month 3 (p < or = 0.04), when brimonidine had lower mean IOP. At trough the mean decreases from baseline ranged from 3.7 +/- 4.0 mm Hg to 5.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg for brimonidine and 5.9 +/- 3.4 to 6.6 +/- 3.0 for timolol. A significant between-group difference was seen at trough at all visits (< 0.001), when timolol had a lower mean IOP. Brimonidine and timolol showed sustained efficacy. Both drugs were well-tolerated. The brimonidine group had more ocular allergy, oral dryness and conjunctival follicles. The timolol group had more burning and stinging. In the brimonidine group, 38/513 (7.4%) discontinued treatment due to ocular allergy. The timolol group had significantly lower mean heart rate compared to baseline. The effect on blood pressure was minimal for both drugs. Brimonidine showed efficacy similar to timolol and a relatively low rate of ocular allergy. Brimonidine 0.2% administered twice daily is an effective and safe ocular hypotensive agent that maintains IOP-lowering in chronic use.
To elucidate the effect of the polyphenols contained in alcoholic beverages on the metabolic stress induced by ethanol consumption, four groups of mice were fed for five weeks on Lieber's diet with or without ethanol, with ethanol plus ellagic acid, and with ethanol plus trans-resveratrol. Alcoholic fatty liver was observed in the group fed the ethanol diet but not in those fed the ethanol plus polyphenol diets. Liver transcriptome analysis revealed that the addition of the polyphenols suppressed the expression of the genes related to cell stress that were up-regulated by ethanol alone. Conversely, the polyphenols up-regulated the genes involved in bile acid synthesis, unsaturated fatty acid elongation, and tetrahydrofolate synthesis that were down-regulated by ethanol alone. Because parts of these genes were known to be regulated by the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), we performed the same experiment in the CAR-deficient mice. As a result, fatty liver was observed not only in the ethanol group but also with the ethanol plus polyphenol groups. In addition, there was no segregation of the gene expression profiles among these groups. These results provide a molecular basis for the prevention of alcohol-induced stress by the polyphenols in alcoholic beverages.
This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization (EAD) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes (TdP) with QT prolongation induced by dl-sotalol and azimilide. The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated.
Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium, midmyocardium, and endocardium were recorded simultaneously, together with a transmural ECG, in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations. dl-Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration (APD) in M cells dose-dependently (1 to 100 micromol/L), leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR. Azimilide, however, significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 micromol/L but shortened them at 30 micromol/L. Unlike dl-sotalol, azimilide (>3 micromol/L) increased epicardial APD markedly, causing a diminished TDR. Although both dl-sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles, they produced frequent EADs in rabbits, in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen. An increase in TDR by dl-sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles. Of note, although azimilide (3 to 10 micromol/L) increased APD more than dl-sotalol, its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally, probably because of a diminished TDR.
This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation.
Poor control of glucose homeostasis accounts for diabetes-related bone loss. Incretins - GLP-1 and GIP - have been proposed to affect bone turnover. GLP-1, apart from its anti-diabetic and other actions, has shown to exert a bone anabolic effect in streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic (T2D) and fructose-induced insulin-resistant (IR) rats. Exendin-4 (Ex-4), a peptide of non-mammalian nature, is sharing with GLP-1 part of its structural sequence, and also several glucoregulatory effects in mammals in an even more efficient manner. We have explored the effect of continuous administration (3 days by osmotic pump) of Ex-4 or saline (control) on bone turnover factors and bone structure in T2D and IR rats, compared to N, and the possible interaction of Ex-4 with the Wnt signalling pathway. Blood was taken before and after treatment for plasma measurements; tibiae and femurs were collected for gene expression of bone markers (RT-PCR) and structure (microCT) analysis; we also measured the mRNA levels of LRP5 - an activator of the Wnt pathway - and those of DKK1 and sclerostin (SOST) - both blockers of LRP5 activity. Compared to N-control, plasma glucose and insulin were respectively higher and lower in T2D; osteocalcin (OC) and tartrate-resistant alkaline phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b) were lower; after Ex-4, these turnover markers were further reduced in T2D and IR, while TRAP5b increased in N. Bone OC, osteoprogeterin (OPG) and receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) mRNA were lower in T2D and IR; Ex-4 increased OC in all groups and OPG in N and IR, reduced RANKL in N and T2D but increased it in IR; the LRP5/DKK1 and LRP5/SOST mRNA ratios were similarly decreased in T2D, but in IR, the latter ratio was reduced while the former was increased; after Ex-4, both ratios augmented in N, and that of LRP5/DKK1 tended to normalize in T2D and IR. In conclusion, Ex-4 exerts osteogenic effects in T2D and IR models, and interacts with the Wnt pathway to promote bone formation.
Ferric nitrilotriacetate induces oxidative renal tubular damage via Fenton-reaction, which subsequently leads to renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in rodents. Here, we used gene expression microarray and array-based comparative genomic hybridization analyses to find target oncogenes in this model. At the common chromosomal region of amplification (4q22) in rat RCCs, we found ptprz1, a tyrosine phosphatase (also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta or receptor tyrosine phosphatase beta) highly expressed in the RCCs. Analyses revealed genomic amplification up to eightfold. Despite scarcity in the control kidney, the amounts of PTPRZ1 were increased in the kidney after 3 weeks of oxidative stress, and mRNA levels were increased 16 approximately 552-fold in the RCCs. Network analysis of the expression revealed the involvement of the beta-catenin pathway in the RCCs. In the RCCs, dephosphorylated beta-catenin was translocated to nuclei, resulting in the expression of its target genes cyclin D1, c-myc, c-jun, fra-1, and CD44. Furthermore, knockdown of ptprz1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA), in FRCC-001 and FRCC-562 cell lines established from the induced RCCs, decreased the amounts of nuclear beta-catenin and suppressed cellular proliferation concomitant with a decrease in the expression of target genes. These results demonstrate that chronic oxidative stress can induce genomic amplification of ptprz1, activating beta-catenin pathways without the involvement of Wnt signaling for carcinogenesis. Thus, iron-mediated persistent oxidative stress confers an environment for gene amplification.
Peritonitis has a significant impact upon morbidity and mortality of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Gram-positive organisms account for the majority of infections and vancomycin is a cost effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment for PD peritonitis, but this may lead to the emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant organisms. The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate the efficacy of a non-vancomycin-based protocol comprising cephazolin and gentamicin, which was introduced in the present PD population as empirical treatment for peritonitis.
The study involved 82 peritonitis episodes over a 4-year period in 58 patients, excluding those with previous methicillin-resistant staphylococcal peritonitis.
With cephazolin and gentamicin there was no apparent difference in response or relapse rates in comparison to reported studies using vancomycin-based first-line therapy protocols.
We advocate initial treatment of PD peritonitis with non-vancomycin-based therapy given similar efficacy and the potential for reduction of resistant organisms.
A successful replacement pharmacotherapy for treating cocaine dependency would likely reduce cocaine's abuse, support a low abuse liability, overlap cocaine's subjective effects, and have a long duration of action. Inhibitors with varying selectivity at the dopamine transporter (DAT) have approximated these properties. The objective of the present study was to characterize the behavioural effects of an extremely selective DAT inhibitor, (+) trans-4-(2-Benzhydryloxyethyl)-1-(4-fluorobenzyl) piperadin-3-ol (D-84), a 3-hydroxy substituted piperidine derivative of GBR-12935, for its cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects, its effects on cocaine self-administration, and for its own self-administration. During cocaine discrimination tests, cocaine occasioned the 10 mg/kg cocaine training stimulus with an ED(50) value of 3.13 (1.54-6.34) mg/kg, and reduced response rates with an ED(50) value of 20.39 (7.24-57.44) mg/kg. D-84 incompletely generalized to the cocaine stimulus occasioning a maximal 76% cocaine-lever responding, while reducing response rates with lower potency than cocaine (ED(50)=30.94 (12.34-77.60) mg/kg). Pretreatment with D-84 (9.6-30.4 mg/kg) significantly (P<0.05) reduced cocaine intake at 17.1 mg/kg D-84 when cocaine was self-administered at 0.5 mg/kg/infusion, and at 30.4 mg/kg D-84 when cocaine was self-administered at 0.1, 0.5 .and 1.0 mg/kg/infusion. During self-administration tests with D-84 (0.1-1 mg/kg/infusion), numbers of infusions significantly exceeded vehicle levels at 0.3 mg/kg/infusion. These results show that D-84 pretreatment can decrease cocaine intake especially when high doses of cocaine are being self-administered. This observation, combined with its incomplete generalization to the cocaine discriminative stimulus and its reported long duration of action, provides a profile consistent with a potential replacement therapy for treating cocaine-abusing patients.
The short-term use of indomethacin has been shown to be relatively safe and effective in halting premature labor. Its use has been associated with adverse renal effects in both the fetal and newborn periods that are generally transient and resolve on discontinuation of the drug. However, limited data suggest that prolonged prenatal exposure to indomethacin may be harmful to the fetus. We report a case of prolonged severe renal dysfunction characterized by oligohydramnios and postnatal anuria, azotemia, and ultrasonographic kidney abnormalities associated with the long-term prenatal use of indomethacin. Although partial resolution was observed, a moderate decrease in renal function persists. Prenatal maternal indomethacin use represents a potential cause of renal dysfunction in the newborn infant that may be only partially reversible.
Induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is thought to play a protective role in ischaemic acute renal failure (ARF). However the role of HSPs in nephrotoxic ARF is not well explored. The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of the induction of HSP70s on cisplatin (CDDP) (6 mg/kg i.v.)-induced ARF in rats. Uranyl acetate (UA) or sodium arsenite (SA) were administered i.v. 14 days or 1 day respectively before CDDP injection to induce HSPs. Serum creatinine (SCr), tubular damage score and the numbers of apoptotic (TUNEL-positive) cells were examined 5 days after CDDP injection. The expression of HSP72, B-cell lymphoma gene product-2 (Bcl-2) and Bax were evaluated by Western blot analysis. We also investigated the effect of co-administration of chelerythrine chloride (Chel), which inhibits the induction of HSPs, with SA on the expression of HSP72 and nephrotoxicity. Pretreatment with UA or SA significantly induced renal HSP72 expression. Both UA and SA attenuated the CDDP-induced increase in SCr and tubular damage scores. Co-administration of Chel with SA abolished the SA-induced increment of HSP72 and the beneficial effects of SA. The protective effects of the induction of HSP72 were associated with an increased renal Bcl-2/Bax ratio and the reduction of TUNEL-positive cells in the outer stripe of outer medulla. Our findings suggest that HSP72 attenuates CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. The protective effects of HSP72 are associated with an increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio and less apoptosis.
Indomethacin is widely used to treat both preterm labor and polyhydramnios. Although adverse fetal and neonatal reactions have been described, the use of indomethacin is not thought to pose a risk to the mother. A case of maternal renal function impairment caused by indomethacin therapy for preterm labor at 27 weeks in a twin pregnancy is presented. The patient was given a 17-day course of indomethacin at standard tocolytic doses of 25 mg orally, every 6 hours. She was delivered after a diagnosis of chorioamnionitis was made and antibiotics, including gentamicin, were instituted. Three days post partum the patient was found to have a blood urea nitrogen value of 27 mg/dl and a serum creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dl. Maternal renal function rapidly improved after the discontinuation of gentamicin. This case represents a potentially serious interaction between an aminoglycoside and indomethacin in an otherwise healthy woman at no risk of renal disease. Monitoring of renal function is advisable when potentially nephrotoxic drugs are given with or soon after indomethacin.
A 70 year old hypertensive patient who had undergone a gastrectomy experienced withdrawal symptoms 10 h after a second epidural injection of morphine (150 micrograms X kg-1) for postoperative analgesia. A clonidine treatment had been stopped 129 h earlier. These symptoms disappeared shortly after a third epidural injection of morphine. Clonidine was then reintroduced. The later progressive interruption of epidural morphine analgesia did not introduce any further symptoms of withdrawal. Since physical dependence on a drug is related to repeated and prolonged administration of that drug, opiate withdrawal symptoms were highly unlikely after epidural morphine used to relieve immediate postoperative pain. Abrupt discontinuation of a long-term treatment by clonidine may produce a withdrawal syndrome, but clinical and biological signs usually occur earlier than noted in this case. Recent experimental and clinical data has provided support for the existence of a complex presynaptic regulation of noradrenergic transmission in the central nervous system, both alpha 2 and opiate receptors being implicated. The activation of such presynaptic receptors inhibits further transmitter release. Suddenly stopping the chronic administration of alpha 2 or opiate agonists was responsible for a rebound excitation of these noradrenergic neurons, inducing a withdrawal syndrome. The related withdrawal symptoms may have resulted from an interaction between the discontinuation of clonidine and the decrease in morphine activity. Practitioners should be warned of this possible side-effects.
Twenty men with moderate infection of Onchocerca volvulus were studied in a double-masked, controlled clinical trial to compare the safety and efficacy of oral diethylcarbamazine (DEC) with topical DEC lotion. Visual acuity and colour vision did not alter during the 6 months of observation, although 2 patients receiving DEC lotion and 3 patients receiving oral DEC developed either visual field constriction or optic atrophy. Fluffy corneal opacities were common in both groups. Intraocular microfilariae also appeared in both groups but to a greater extent in those receiving DEC lotion. New chorioretinal changes developed in 4 men receiving lotion and in only 1 receiving tablets. It is concluded that DEC lotion offers no advantage over tablets in the treatment of ocular onchocerciasis and in fact may be associated with more ocular complications than the conventional oral treatment.
Perfluorobutyrate (PFBA) is a perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) found in the environment. Previous studies have indicated developmental toxicity of PFAAs (perfluorooctane sulfonate [PFOS] and perfluorooctanoate [PFOA]); the current study examines that of PFBA. PFBA/NH4(+) was given to timed-pregnant CD-1 mice by oral gavage daily from gestational day (GD) 1 to 17 at 35, 175, or 350 mg/kg (chosen to approximate the developmentally toxic doses of PFOA); controls received water. At GD 18, serum levels of PFBA were 3.8, 4.4, and 2.5 microg/ml, respectively, in the three treated groups. PFBA did not significantly affect maternal weight gain, number of implantations, fetal viability, fetus weight, or incidence of fetal malformations. Incidence of full-litter loss was significantly greater in the 350 mg/kg group, and maternal liver weights were significantly increased in the 175 and 350 mg/kg groups. In contrast to PFOA and PFOS, PFBA exposure during pregnancy did not adversely affect neonatal survival or postnatal growth. Liver enlargement was detected in the PFBA-exposed pups on postnatal day (PD) 1, but not by PD 10. Expression of selected hepatic genes in PFBA-exposed pups at PD 1 did not reveal any significant changes from controls. A significant delay in eye-opening in offspring was detected in all three PFBA groups, and slight delays in the onset of puberty were noted in the 175 and 350 mg/kg groups. These data suggest that exposure to PFBA during pregnancy in the mouse did not produce developmental toxicity comparable to that observed with PFOA, in part, due to rapid elimination of the chemical.
Glycogen storage disease type VI (GSD6) defines a group of disorders that cause hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia with reduced liver phosphorylase activity. The course of these disorders is generally mild, but definitive diagnosis requires invasive procedures. We analyzed a Mennonite kindred with an autosomal recessive form of GSD6 to determine the molecular defect and develop a non-invasive diagnostic test. Linkage analysis was performed using genetic markers flanking the liver glycogen phosphorylase gene ( PYGL ), which was suspected to be the cause of the disorder on biochemical grounds. Mennonite GSD6 was linked to the PYGL locus with a multipoint LOD score of 4.7. The PYGL gene was analyzed for mutations by sequencing genomic DNA. Sequencing of genomic DNA revealed a splice site abnormality of the intron 13 splice donor. Confirmation of the genomic mutation was performed by sequencing RT-PCR products, which showed heterogeneous PYGL mRNA lacking all or part of exon 13 in affected persons. This study is the first to demonstrate that a mutation in the PYGL gene can cause GSD6. This mutation is estimated to be present on 3% of Mennonite chromosomes and the disease affects 0.1% of that population. Determination of this mutation provides a basis for the development of a simple and non-invasive diagnostic test for the disease and the carrier state in this population and confirms biochemical data showing the importance of this gene in glucose homeostasis.
A case of mesalazine-induced acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in a 41-year-old patient with ulcerative colitis (UC) is reported here. Clinical symptoms such as fever and arthralgia, and laboratory findings such as eosinophilia and renal failure suggested AIN, which was confirmed by biopsy. With withdrawal of mesalazine and intravenous methylprednisolone the patient's renal function was recovered. It is observed that early discontinuation of mesalazine is associated with amelioration of interstitial nephritis in most patients, so the recommendation is that patients receiving mesalazine should undergo routine monitoring of renal function. Delayed diagnosis may lead to permanent renal function impairment.
A family of co-chaperone proteins that share the Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) domain are involved in a number of cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis. Among these proteins, BAG3 has received increased attention due to its high levels in several disease models and ability to associate with Hsp70 and a number of other molecular partners. BAG3 expression is stimulated during cell response to stressful conditions, such as exposure to high temperature, heavy metals, and certain drugs. Here, we demonstrate that BAG3 expression is elevated upon HIV-1 infection of human lymphocytes and fetal microglial cells. Furthermore, BAG3 protein was detectable in the cytoplasm of reactive astrocytes in HIV-1-associated encephalopathy biopsies, suggesting that induction of BAG3 is part of the host cell response to viral infection. To assess the impact of BAG3 upregulation on HIV-1 gene expression, we performed transcription assays and demonstrated that BAG3 can suppress transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) in microglial cells. This activity was mapped to the kappaB motif of the HIV-1 LTR. Results from in vitro and in vivo binding assays revealed that BAG3 suppresses interaction of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB with the kappaB DNA motif of the LTR. Results from binding and transcriptional assay identified the C-terminus of BAG3 as a potential domain involved in the observed inhibitory effect of BAG3 on p65 activity. These observations reveal a previously unrecognized cell response, that is, an increase in BAG3, elicited by HIV-1 infection, and may provide a new avenue for the suppression of HIV-1 gene expression.
