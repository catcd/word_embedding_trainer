A study was undertaken to assess the receptor binding characteristics of [3H]4-benzylpempidine to an allosteric site on calf brain membranes associated with nicotinic cholinergic receptors and to compare the binding affinity of novel arylpempidine analogs with their ability to antagonize the behavioral effects of nicotine in mice. Scatchard analysis of the binding yielded a K(d) of 20 nM and a B(max) of 330 fmols/mg membrane protein. [3H]4-benzylpempidine appears to be a more satisfactory ligand than [3H]mecamylamine, since it possessed a 50-fold greater affinity and its binding was far less sensitive to inorganic ions and Tris. Among the arylpempidine analogs 4-m-chlorobenzylidenepempidine and 4-benzylidenepempidine had the lowest K(i) values (1.4 nM and 5.0 nM, respectively) and were the most potent in antagonizing nicotine-induced seizures in mice. Although the K(i) values for pempidine and mecamylamine were 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than any of the arylpempidines, the dose required to antagonize nicotine-induced seizures in mice was comparable to the arylpempidines. One explanation for this apparent discrepancy in the correlation of binding affinity and nicotine antagonism is the lower brain penetration of arylpempidines compared to mecamylamine, following their systemic administration to mice.
We studied the efficacy and side effects of the H1-antihistamine astemizole in perennial rhinitis. We also defined subgroups of responders and examined the added effect of a steroid spray. Fifty-five adults completed a 10- to 14-week controlled trial. Astemizole reduced the number of sneezes to 41% (p less than 0.001) and the number of nose blowings to 55% (p less than 0.001) of the placebo values. The added use of beclomethasone dipropionate caused a further reduction to 14% (p less than 0.001) and 37% (p less than 0.05), respectively. Nasal blockage was only marginally affected by the antihistamine, but it was reduced to 64% by the steroid spray (p less than 0.001). "Sneezers" responded better to the antihistamine than "blockers," with "nose blowers" in an intermediate position. The effect was equal in allergic and nonallergic patients. Astemizole was completely nonsedative but increased appetite and body weight. An open 1-year study of 17 patients demonstrated that astemizole maintained its efficacy and that further weight gain did not occur. It is concluded that astemizole is a highly effective nonsedative H1-antihistamine suitable for continuous therapy of perennial rhinitis.
The role of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) in determining the severity and outcome of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by methicillin (meticillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is controversial. We evaluated potential associations between clinical outcome and PVL status by using MRSA isolates from patients enrolled in two large, multinational phase three clinical trials assessing telavancin for the treatment of cSSSI (the ATLAS program). MRSA isolates from microbiologically evaluable patients were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and PCR for pvl and 31 other putative virulence determinants. A single baseline pathogen of MRSA was isolated from 522 microbiologically evaluable patients (25.1%) among 2,079 randomized patients. Of these MRSA isolates, 83.2% (432/519) exhibited the USA300 PFGE genotype and 89.1% (465/522) were pvl positive. Patients with pvl-positive MRSA were more likely than those with pvl-negative MRSA to be young, to be North American, and to present with major abscesses (P < 0.001 for each). Patients were significantly more likely to be cured if they were infected with pvl-positive MRSA than if they were infected with pvl-negative MRSA (91.6% versus 80.7%; P = 0.015). This observation remained statistically significant after adjustment for presence of abscess, fever, or leukocytosis; infection size; diabetes; patient age; and study medication received. The fnbA, cna, sdrC, map-eap, sed, seg, sei, sej, SCCmec type IV, and agr group II genes were also associated with clinical response (P < 0.05). This contemporary, international study demonstrates that pvl was not the primary determinant of outcome in patients with MRSA cSSSI.
ICRF-187 was tested for cardioprotective activity in doxorubicin-treated mice and guinea pigs. Pretreatment with i.p. ICRF-187 caused a significant decrease in the indicence of i.v. doxorubicin-induced myocardial histological damage in the mouse. I.p. ICRF-187 did not, however, reduce the effect of i.p. doxorubicin on a functional myocardial effect of this antitumour drug, a reduced histamine responsiveness of right atria in vitro. These data suggest that ICRF-187 may not be specific for all the cardiac effects of doxorubicin.
The effects of acute haemodilution, during prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-induced hypotension, on the blood coagulation-fibrinolysis system were studied in 40 patients undergoing hip surgery. The patients were randomly divided into four groups of 10 patients each; Group A (control) received no induced hypotension or haemodilution, group B received hypotension alone, group C received haemodilution alone and group D received the combination of induced hypotension and haemodilution. Haemodilution in groups C and D was produced by drawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of 6% hydroxyethyl starch. Induced hypotension in groups B and D was conducted with PGE1 and mean blood pressure was maintained at 55 mmHg. The mean dosage of PGE1 was 648 micrograms in group B and 661 micrograms in group D. In the control and PGE1-induced hypotension groups there was no significant change in platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromoplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen (FIB), antithrombin-III (AT-III) or plasminogen (PLG). Haemodilution alone caused significant decreases in PLT (-43%), PT (+21%), FIB (-33%), AT-III (-21%) and PLG (-27%), and a significant increase in aPTT (+26%), whereas the combination of PGE1-induced hypotension did not cause any further change in these parameters. Serum-fibrin degradation products (FDP) significantly increased (+300%) and PLG significantly decreased (-30%) after surgery in all groups. It can be concluded that acute haemodilution to a haematocrit value of 22 +/- 2% causes a slight coagulopathy, which is not enhanced when combined with PGE1-induced hypotension.
Octreotide is increasingly being used in the treatment of acromegaly. It effectively suppresses growth hormone secretion but also has inhibitory effects on gastrointestinal regulatory peptides and induces gallbladder paresis, which may predispose to gallstone formation. In nine acromegalic patients receiving long-term octreotide treatment gallbladder emptying, assessed by 99Tc-EHIDA scintigraphy after a standard fatty meal, was significantly impaired (p less than 0.005) when compared with normal healthy control subjects. Asymptomatic gallstone formation occurred in one patient who had the most severely impaired gallbladder emptying. Between 24 and 96 h after cessation of octreotide, in six of seven patients studied, gallbladder emptying had not only recovered but demonstrated significant rebound hypermotility (p less than 0.005). This finding has important implications for the administration of long-term octreotide therapy and suggests that a drug-free period each week may enable evacuation of gallbladder contents and reduce the risk of gallstone formation.
In preclinical models, there is synergism between chemotherapy and recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on apoptosis induction in tumor cells. Therefore, the prognostic relevance was analyzed of the expression of TRAIL and its death receptors DR4 and DR5 on disease-free survival and overall survival in stage III colon cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.
Tissue microarrays were constructed of primary tumor tissue from 376 stage III colon cancer patients treated in a randomized adjuvant chemotherapy study (fluorouracil/levamisole v fluorouracil/levamisole/leucovorin) and stained immunohistochemically for TRAIL, DR4, and DR5. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazard analysis, with adjustment for treatment arm, sex, age, N stage, microsatellite instability status, and p53 mutation status, were performed.
The majority of tumors showed high expression of TRAIL (83%), DR4 (92%), and DR5 (87%). Median follow-up was 43 months. High DR4 expression was associated with worse disease-free survival (odds ratio [OR] = 2.19; 95% CI, 1.06 to 4.53; P = .03), worse overall survival (OR = 2.22; 95% CI,1.03 to 4.81; P = .04) and shorter time to recurrence (P = .02) compared with those with low DR4 expression. TRAIL or DR5 expression had no prognostic value.
High DR4 expression is associated with worse disease-free and overall survival in stage III adjuvant-treated colon cancer patients. Evaluation of DR4 expression in stage III colon cancer patients may identify a subset requiring more aggressive adjuvant treatment.
The aim of this study was to examine the participation of nitrergic neurotransmission in the initiation of micturition hyperreflexia associated to cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced cystitis in rats. Micturition threshold volume was significantly reduced 4 h after CP administration (100 mg/kg, i.p.); this reduction was attenuated by intra-arterially injected N(G)-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (l-NAME), a non selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, but not by intravesical infusion of S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (l-SMTC), another structurally different NOS inhibitor. Interestingly, l-NAME failed to affect micturition threshold volume in normal rats. The magnitude of isolated detrusor strips contractions elicited by either carbachol or nerve activation was significantly reduced in CP-treated rats but was unaffected by the addition of N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NOARG), a nonselective NOS inhibitor. In contrast, intrathecal l-NAME and l-SMTC but not N(G)-nitro-d-arginine-methyl ester (d-NAME) administration augmented the micturition threshold volume in CP-treated rats in an l-arginine preventable manner. As with the systemic injection, intrathecal l-NAME also did not affect the micturition threshold volume in normal rats. Four hours after CP injection, the number of neuronal NOS immunoreactive or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) positive neurons in spinal lumbosacral segments (L6-S2) was not altered whereas the number of c-Fos immunoreactive neurons increased significantly in the dorsal gray commissural nucleus (DGC), the parasympathetic sacral nucleus (PSN) and lamina X of these segments. Ca(2+)-dependent, but not Ca(2+)-independent NOS activity increased significantly in spinal L6-S2 segments but not in thoracic segments of CP-treated rats. These data indicate that the micturition hyperreflexia observed in the initial hours of CP-induced cystitis is associated with an increase in Ca(2+)-dependent NOS activity in spinal L6-S2 segments suggesting an increased production of nitric oxide (NO). The increased production of NO in these spinal segments appears to be necessary for the initiation of the micturition hyperreflexia.
We have observed a severe atypical neuropathy (SAN) in patients with small non-cleaved-cell (SNCL) and large-cell lymphoma (LCL) treated with intensive chemotherapy and hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). The present analysis was undertaken in an attempt to identify factors associated with the development of this syndrome.
Fifty-four adult and pediatric patients consecutively treated according to the same chemotherapy protocol were included in the analysis. Low-risk patients received three cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate (CODOX-M) while in high-risk patients this drug combination was alternated with high-dose cytarabine (ara-C), etoposide, and ifosfamide (IVAC) for a total of four cycles. Twenty-eight patients received a CSF (granulocyte [G]- or granulocyte-macrophage [GM]-CSF), and 26 patients received no CSF. A statistical analysis, which included a logistic regression model, was undertaken to examine the importance of potential contributing factors to the development of SAN.
SAN, which consisted of excruciating foot pain, usually associated with marked motor weakness, was observed in 12 patients. There was a highly significant association between the occurrence of this syndrome and the administration of CSFs, and an independent association with the cumulative dose of vincristine given in the first cycle of chemotherapy. Furthermore, the analysis suggested a synergistic effect between administration of the CSFs and vincristine in the genesis of this neuropathy.
Our results indicate that CSFs can precipitate SAN when given in conjunction with vincristine. The development of SAN was associated most strongly with the cumulative dose of vincristine -- the size of individual doses and the number of doses given in cycle 1 were important to the extent that they influenced the cumulative dose.
We reviewed the use of physostigmine in the diagnosis and management of acute toxic psychosis due to drugs with anticholinergic properties. The syndrome of agitation and toxic confusional psychosis associated with peripheral signs of cholinergic blockade is produced by several plant toxins, antispasmodics, ophthalmic preparations, and certain proprietary sedatives, as well as antiparkinson medications, antidepressants, and some antipsychotic drugs. Physostigmine, uniquely among the available reversible anticholinesterase agents, can pass the blood-brain barrier to exert central as well as peripheral cholinomimetic actions to reverse this syndrome. Psychiatrists should make more use of this safe, specific, rapid, and effective treatment for anticholinergic drug toxicity, and should particularly be alert to reversible anticholinergic brain syndromes associated with antidepressants and antiparkinson medications, and even with antipsychotic medications.
Following lung instillation in adult male rats of 3.4 mumol hexavalent chromium (K2Cr2O7) dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl, increased levels of lung surfactant could be detected after 48 h. The blood serum concentration of corticosterone was elevated in these animals. Blood serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine showed an initial increase after lung instillation of hexavalent chromium followed by a decline. Metabolism of testosterone by the alveolar macrophages to 17 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstane-3-one and 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol was reduced 6 and 12 h after the K2Cr2O7 instillation, which was also associated with damage of lung cell function and decreased uptake by the alveolar macrophages of Candida albicans particles. As early as 12 h after s.c. administration of 400 micrograms dexamethasone/100 g body wt, increased levels of lung surfactant could be measured. At this time the lungs showed no signs of cellular damage, and metabolism of testosterone as well as uptake of Candida albicans particles by the alveolar macrophages were normal. Lower s.c. doses of dexamethasone did not result in raising the levels of lung surfactant in 12 h. Within 12 h after s.c. administration of large doses of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone no measurable effects on the levels of lung surfactant could be measured. Since animals treated with dexamethasone (200 micrograms/100 g body wt) or long-acting synthetic ACTH (100 micrograms i.m. Synacthen Depot/100 g body wt) for 5 days after lung instillation of K2Cr2O7 had extremely high levels of lung surfactant, it is concluded that the corticosteroids in adult rats may help to create augmented surfactant levels following lung intoxication. This could proceed via stimulation of surfactant production and reduction of surfactant removal. Different aspects of lung surfactant metabolism are discussed.
Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic agent. Although clinical and experimental studies have shown that an antiarrhythmic dose of lidocaine can protect the brain from ischemic damage, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, we examined whether lidocaine inhibits neuronal apoptosis in the penumbra in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. Male Wistar rats underwent a 90-min temporary occlusion of middle cerebral artery. Lidocaine was given as an i.v. bolus (1.5 mg/kg) followed by an i.v. infusion (2 mg/kg/h) for 180 min, starting 30 min before ischemia. Rats were killed and brain samples were collected at 4 and 24 h after ischemia. Apoptotic changes were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) for DNA fragmentation. Cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation were detected at 4 and 24 h after ischemia and DNA fragmentation was detected at 24 h. Double-labeling with NeuN, a neuronal marker, demonstrated that cytochrome c, caspase-3, and TUNEL were confined to neurons. Lidocaine reduced cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in the penumbra at 4 h and diminished DNA fragmentation in the penumbra at 24 h. Lidocaine treatment improved early electrophysiological recovery and reduced the size of the cortical infarct at 24 h, but had no significant effect on cerebral blood flow in either the penumbra or core during ischemia. These findings suggest that lidocaine attenuates apoptosis in the penumbra after transient focal cerebral ischemia. The infarct-reducing effects of lidocaine may be due, in part, to the inhibition of apoptotic cell death in the penumbra.
Nephrotoxicity limits the use of cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of various malignancies. Overall, CD4+ T cells mediate cisplatin-induced renal injury; however, the CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cell subset (CD4+CD25+ Treg) has broad suppressive effects on many different cell types. In this study, we determined whether CD4+CD25+ Treg cells had protective effects against cisplatin-induced acute renal injury in nu/nu mice that lack mature T cells. In these mice, there was marked attenuation of the decreased survival, renal dysfunction and tubular injury, renal tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β cytokine levels. Furthermore, renal macrophage accumulation was reduced in CD4+CD25+ Treg cell-adoptive transferred nu/nu mice compared with control mice. Infusion of CD4+CD25+Treg cells into wild-type Balb/c mice reduced serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels equivalent to those in nu/nu mice and extended their survival time after cisplatin injection. In contrast, depletion of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in wild-type mice exacerbated kidney injury after cisplatin administration. Transcription factor Foxp3-positive cells (Treg cells) were detected in the kidneys of nu/nu mice after cisplatin injection. Our results suggest that CD4+CD25+ Treg cells directly affect cisplatin nephrotoxicity and their modulation represents an additional treatment strategy.
Wide pulse pressure is considered to be a sign of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). We tested the hypothesis that, following indomethacin therapy, PDA closure is associated with a significant decrease in pulse pressure. Thirty-two ventilated preterm infants were echocardiographically diagnosed within the first 24 hours of life with PDA. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures were measured prior to indomethacin treatment and after echocardiographically confirmed PDA closure. Following PDA closure, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and mean arterial pressure increased significantly without a significant change of pulse pressure (17 +/- 7 to 20 +/- 12 torr). We conclude that in preterm infants with PDA, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures increase significantly within first few days of life. Pulse pressure does not appear to be affected by early PDA closure. We speculate that high pulmonary resistance in the first days of life prevents significant diastolic aortic runoff and leaves pulse pressure unaffected by PDA, as well as by its closure.
Some reports indicate that fibrates can induce renal dysfunction. However, the clinical characteristics of these episodes, and the respective nephrotoxicity of the four main fibrates used-namely, fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and gemfibrozil-remain ill defined.
To better characterize this side-effect, we first reviewed the charts of 27 patients from our institution who developed an impairment of renal function during fibrate therapy. We next analysed the articles (n=24) that contained data on renal function in patients taking fibrates (n=2676).
Among our 27 patients, 25 were on fenofibrate therapy, one was taking bezafibrate, and one ciprofibrate. Nineteen were recipients of solid-organ transplants (kidney recipients, n=15; heart or heart-lung recipients, n=4), and eight were non-transplanted patients with some impairment of renal function. Baseline plasma creatinine ranged from 0.9 to 2.9 mg/dl. It increased by a mean of 40% after the start of fibrate therapy. There was a concomitant increase of blood urea values (mean 36%) in most of the patients. Renal function returned to baseline in 18/24 patients after fibrate discontinuation. However, six patients, all transplant recipients, experienced a permanent increase in plasma creatinine. The incidence of fibrate-induced renal dysfunction among our series of kidney transplant recipients was 60%, as it occurred in 15 of the 25 patients who had ever taken fibrates. An increase of mean creatinine values during therapy was described in all papers on fenofibrate (n=7) and bezafibrate (n=8) (range 8-18% and 8-40% respectively), and in three of four papers dealing with ciprofibrate (range 6-16%). No significant renal impairment was described in any of the eight articles reporting data on gemfibrozil therapy.
Therapy with fenofibrate, bezafibrate, and ciprofibrate may induce renal dysfunction. Gemfibrozil appears to be devoid of this side-effect.
The role of intracellular pH and Ca2+ and their association with mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are explored in the chemoprevention of colon cancer. 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH), a potent procarcinogen with selectivity for the colon, at a dose of 30 mg/kg body weight was used to induce initial stages of colon cancer when administered for 6 weeks in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Diclofenac, a preferential cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, was used at the anti-inflammatory dose (8 mg/kg body weight) for chemoprevention. The control group was administered vehicles for both DMH and diclofenac. A diclofenac-alone group with the same dose was also run simultaneously. Intracellular pH values as determined by biscarboxyethyl carboxyfluorescein fluorescence assay showed an alkaline pH in colonocytes from the DMH-treated group as compared with the control group. Moreover, the level of intracellular Ca2+ was also found to be decreased with DMH treatment, as shown by the fura-2 acetoxymethyl study and chlortetracycline assay. Apoptosis was studied by comet assay and Apaf-1 immunofluorescent expression and was found to be markedly decreased in this group, indicating that disturbances in pH and Ca2+ homeostasis promoted proliferation in colon and inhibited apoptosis. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS levels were analyzed in isolated colonocytes by rhodamine 123 and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate labeling, respectively. DMH treatment promoted a higher mitochondrial membrane potential while reducing ROS levels. These parameters are known to be associated with pH and Ca2+ changes intracellularly and hence can be suggested to be linked with them in this study also. Diclofenac promoted apoptosis in colonocytes when coadministered with DMH and also ameliorated the changes observed in the above parameters, confirming these mechanisms as early events for the onset of apoptosis in cancer cells.
The effect of 1.4% polyvinyl alcohol and castor oil vehicles on pilocarpine-induced hypotension was studied in 50 patients with open-angle glaucoma. Diurnal tension curves showed that the mean intraocular pressure was lower and the maximum diurnal variation smaller during the treatment with oily drops of 2% and 4% pilocarpine instilled 2-3 times daily than when 2% and 4% pilocarpine in polyvinyl alcohol was instilled 3-4 times daily. The differences were statistically significant. In long-term treatment no marked pilocarpine tolerance developed in cases treated with oily drops of pilocarpine. It is concluded that in the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, the hypotensive effect of pilocarpine in an oily vehicle instilled 2-3 times daily is greater and more even than that of pilocarpine of corresponding strength in polyvinyl alcohol administered 3-4 times daily.
In pentobarbital sodium-anaesthetized dogs, pinacidil was infused for approximately 5 min into the carotid, coronary, femoral or renal artery at a rate of 10 micrograms/kg per min. The infusion, which did not affect systemic blood pressure, rapidly and markedly increased blood flow to any of the regions studied. When given i.v., 0.2 mg/kg pinacidil caused a moderate reduction in mean arterial blood pressure (15-20 mmHg) associated with an increase in coronary and renal blood flow while femoral and carotid blood flow remained unchanged; 0.5 mg/kg led to a marked (40-60 mmHg) reduction in blood pressure associated with an increase in coronary blood flow whereas renal, carotid and femoral blood flow stabilized at control levels. Indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) failed to reverse the hypotension induced by pinacidil. The results are in accord with the concept that the vascular effect of pinacidil is due to direct smooth muscle relaxation which does not depend on prostaglandin synthesis.
A previously healthy 2 1/2-year-old girl developed status epilepticus followed by cortical blindness during intravenous N-acetylcysteine therapy for paracetamol ingestion. The child's vision was almost completely recovered during the 18 months follow-up period. We assume that the cortical blindness was a postictal sequela after prolonged seizure episode, most probably due to respiratory depression induced by N-acetylcysteine.
Trends in cocaine use over the past 2 decades were compared across levels of education in a population-based US sample of adults. Significant inverse associations between educational achievement and cocaine use after 1990 were driven by dramatic decreases in persistent cocaine use among more highly educated adults, whereas persistent cocaine use remained relatively unchanged among those who did not finish high school. This emerging health disparity highlights the need for improved interventions that target persistent cocaine users with low educational achievement.
To determine the effect of 1.4% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and castor oil vehicles on the pilocarpine-induced miosis, we studied the miotic effect of 2% pilocarpine-PVA and oily drops on 4 young and 10 elderly people and the miotic effect of 4% pilocarpine-PVA and oily drops on 13 elderly people. The miosis developed fast within 15 min, and maximum miosis was rached within 1 h. Oily drops of pilocarpine induced stronger maximum miosis than corresponding PVA-drops. The pupil remained contracted to less than 50% of its starting diameter after pilocarpine-PVA drops for 3-4 h and after oily drops for 9 h and returned to its starting diameter after pilocarpine-PVA drops 9-10 h and after oily drops 20-24 h following administration. The difference in the effect between pilocarpine-PVA and oily drops was independent of the subjects' age.
Pharmacologic testing with dobutamine or dipyridamole in conjunction with echocardiography has become an accepted method for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The sensitivity of dobutamine echo ranges from 68 to 86%, and of dipyridamole from 53 to 69% for diagnosis of CAD. Our purpose was to investigate whether the addition of dipyridamole to dobutamine, which may improve the test sensitivity, is safe. Ten patients with low probability of CAD underwent dobutamine echo; 5 were control patients and 5 patients had low dose dipyridamole added at the maximal dose of dobutamine. Four of the latter patients had severe hypotension, while no hypotension was observed in control patients. Our findings suggest that this combination of dobutamine and dipyridamole can be hazardous and should not be used in patients with suspected CAD.
The effects of deoxycholic acid (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the rat colon were examined. The effect of these bile acids on DNA adduct formation by PhIP in the colon was then analyzed, since the main action of PhIP is the formation of DNA adducts and subsequent gene mutations. For the ACF study, male F344 rats were administered PhIP-HCl (75 mg/kg, 10 doses) by gavage, and a diet containing bile acid (0.4% DCA or UDCA) was provided from 3 days before the first dose of PhIP for 8 weeks. The mean number of ACF per colon of DCA, UDCA and controls were 9.9, 2.4 and 5.5, respectively. The ACF number was significantly increased by DCA and decreased by UDCA (P<0.001). To examine the effect of bile acids on DNA adduct formation, male F344 rats were fed a diet supplemented with bile acids (0.1 or 0.4% of DCA and UDCA) 7 days prior to the PhIP administration. All rats were administered a single dose of PhIP-HCl (50 mg/kg) by gavage and sacrificed 48 hours later. DNA adduct levels of the 0.1% UDCA, 0.1% DCA and controls were 2.93 (adducts/10(7) nucleotides), 2.65 and 1.10, respectively. Those of 0.4% UDCA, 0.4% DCA and controls were 1.64, 1.30 and 1.00, respectively. The PhIP-DNA adduct level was significantly increased by administration of 0.1% UDCA, 0.1% DCA (P<0.05) and 0.4% UDCA (P<0.01). The increasing effect of both DCA and UDCA on PhIP-induced DNA adduct formation was unexpected, and was not directly associated with ACF formation.
Ninety-two patients with intractable rheumatoid arthritis (RA) participated in an open prospective study of the longterm efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate (MTX), administered orally at a constant dosage of 7.5 mg/week. Twenty-four patients (25%) had to be withdrawn from the study within the first 12 months because of inefficacy or adverse reactions with a fatal outcome in 2 patients. In the remaining 68 patients, the mean duration of therapy was 19 months. Sixty-three of 92 patients (68%) experienced significant clinical improvement after one year, 23 (25%) were in clinical remission. Twenty-three of these patients initially responded well but relapsed after a median of 15 months of therapy. In 5 patients (5%) the disease activity remained status quo. Toxicity was noted at some time in 51 patients (54%), consisting of clinical side effects in 37 patients (40%) and biological abnormalities in 36 patients (39%), including 9 patients (10%) with blood and bone marrow toxicity, in whom renal function at start was normal. Two of these latter 9 patients had a fatal outcome because of an unexpected renal deterioration due to intercurrent disease. Thus, MTX at this constant low dose appears to be a temporarily valuable therapy for intractable RA. Careful monitoring is necessary in view of the potentially dangerous side effects.
We report a case of reversible sensorineural hearing loss due to hydroxychloroquine (HQ) treatment. The patient was a 34-year-old woman with 1 year of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). She developed reversible hearing loss after 5 months of HQ treatment. Sensorineural deafness has previously been reported with chloroquine treatment, but this is the first report of ototoxicity associated with HQ in RA.
A regeneration process intended to restore organ function follows liver hepatotoxicity induced by a necrogenic dose of thioacetamide (TAM).
The expression of genes related to inflammation such as nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been analyzed in the course of the regenerative response, using NOS-2 KO mice or animals treated with selective inhibitors of COX-2.
All animals lacking both activities survived to the hepatotoxic administration. However, animals deficient for NOS-2 exhibited more severe organ damage in view of the levels of hepatic serum markers of function, as well as an attenuated activation of NF-kappaB. The levels of C/EBPs were determined as markers of hepatocyte de-differentiation and regeneration, and the expression of COX-2 in TAM treated animals was concomitant with a decrease in C/EBP-alpha level. Analysis of cyclin D1, E and PCNA correlated with hepatocytes entering into the S phase of cell cycle by the effect of TAM.
These data indicate that hepatocytes from TAM-treated mice express NOS-2 and COX-2 proteins and initiate the regeneration process that follows acute liver injury. However, the absence of NO delays hepatocyte regeneration, whereas COX-2-inhibition appears to decrease liver damage.
A 65-year-old female patient with major depressive disorder suffered from clonus, shivering and impaired visual acuity after 20 mg/day of paroxetine administration. The symptoms were initially regarded as further manifestations of her somatic symptoms of depression, and paroxetine was increased to 30 mg/day resulting in frequent clonus, increased shivering, serious dysarthria, ongoing impairment in visual acuity and agitation. These symptoms subsided upon paroxetine discontinuation. Ten mg/day of paroxetine rechallenge provoked dysarthria, tremor and headache, but these symptoms improved again upon paroxetine discontinuation. These findings indicate that the patient's symptoms were not somatic in origin but were in fact the symptoms of serotonin syndrome. In conclusion, the present case suggests the difficulty in diagnosing serotonin syndrome in a patient with somatic symptoms.
We tested the pharmacological action of sulfur-containing amino acids on the development of liver fibrosis in rats and on the function of cultured stellate cells.
Liver fibrosis was induced in rats by thioacetamide administration or by ligating the common bile duct. DNA synthesis of cultured stellate cells was evaluated by BrdU incorporation. The expression of proteins and phospho-proteins was determined by western blot analysis. mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR.
Oral administration of l-cysteine or l-methionine attenuated the deposition of collagen in liver tissues in the two fibrotic models, accompanying a reduction in the expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta and mRNAs of collagens, transforming growth factor-betas and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase. In cultured stellate cells, l-cysteine and l-methionine suppressed the DNA synthesis and the expression of growth factor receptors, smooth muscle alpha-actin and type I collagen. They hampered the phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK and Akt under platelet-derived growth factor-BB stimulation. Stellate cells were found to express methionine adenosyltransferase 2A.
l-Cysteine and l-methionine regulate the activation of stellate cells. Their oral supply aids the suppression of the progression of liver fibrosis.
