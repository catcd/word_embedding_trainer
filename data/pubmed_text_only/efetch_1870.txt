This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of crocin, main component of Crocus sativus L. (Saffron) against subchronic diazinon (DZN) induced cardiotoxicity in rats.
Rats were divided into 7 groups; control (corn oil, gavage), DZN (15 mg/kg/day, gavage,), crocin (12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg/day, i.p) plus DZN, vitamin E (200 IU/kg, i.p, three times per week) plus DZN and crocin (50 mg/kg/day, i.p) groups. Treatments were continued for 4 weeks. Creatine phosphokinase MB (CK-MB), malondealdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were evaluated in heart tissue at the end of treatments. Levels of apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl2, caspase 3) and cytosolic cytochrome c were analyzed by Western blotting. Transcript levels of Bax and Bcl2 were also determined using qRT PCR.
DZN induced histophatological damages and elevated the level of cardiac marker CK-MB. These effects were associated with increased MDA level, lower level of reduced GSH and induction of apoptosis through elevation of Bax/Bcl2 ratio (both protein and mRNA levels), cytochrome c release to the cytosol and activation caspase 3 in cardiac tissue. Crocin (25 and 50 mg/kg) or vitamin E improved histopathological damages, decreased MDA and CK-MB, increased GSH content and attenuated the increase of Bax/Bcl2 ratio, activation of caspase 3 and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol induced by DZN. In summary, DZN induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in heart tissue of rat following subchronic exposure. Crocin, as an antioxidant, showed protective effects against DZN cardiotoxicity by reducing lipid peroxidation and alleviating apoptosis.
Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) is an HTLV-1-associated lymphoproliferative malignancy that is frequently fatal. We compared gene expression profiles (GEPs) of leukemic specimens from nine patients with ATLL at the time of diagnosis and immediately after combination therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and interferon alpha (IFNalpha). GEPs were also related to genetic aberrations determined by comparative genomic hybridization. We identified several genes anomalously over-expressed in the ATLL leukemic cells at the mRNA level, including LYN, CSPG2, and LMO2, and confirmed LMO2 expression in ATLL cells at the protein level. In vivo AZT-IFNalpha therapy evoked a marked induction of interferon-induced genes accompanied by repression of cell-cycle regulated genes, including those encoding ribosomal proteins. Remarkably, patients not responding to AZT-IFNalpha differed most from responding patients in lower expression of these same IFN-responsive genes, as well as components of the antigen processing and presentation apparatus. Demonstration of specific gene expression signatures associated with response to AZT-IFNalpha therapy may provide novel insights into the mechanisms of action in ATLL.
Asparagus racemosus Linn. (AR) is an Ayurvedic rasayana used as an adaptogen. Adaptogenic drugs are those which are useful as anti-stress agents by promoting non-specific resistance of the body. Although, the adaptogenic effect of AR is well documented, its use in psychological disorders like depression is not scientifically evaluated. Hence, the present investigation evaluates the antidepressant effect of methanolic extract of roots of AR (MAR) standardized to saponins (62.2% w/w). Rats were given MAR in the doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg daily for 7 days and then subjected to forced swim test (FST) and learned helplessness test (LH). The results show that MAR decreases immobility in FST and increases avoidance response in LH indicating antidepressant activity. In behavioral experiments, MAR increased the number of head twitches produced by 5-HTP and increased clonidine-induced aggressive behavior indicating facilitatory effect on both serotonergic and adrenergic systems respectively. However, MAR had insignificant effect on l-DOPA-induced aggressive behavior indicating absence of activity on dopaminergic system. MAR also reversed changes to the endogenous antioxidant system induced by FST. Thus, MAR has significant antidepressant activity and this effect is probably mediated through the serotonergic and the noradrenergic systems and augmentation of antioxidant defenses.
The effects of antidepressant drugs on clonidine-induced aggressive behavior were determined in mice. Imipramine, mianserin and iprindole used in a single dose attenuated clonidine-induced aggression. Their chronic administration enhanced it.
Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is an irreversible lung disease characterized by progressive fibrosis in the small airways with eventual occlusion of the airway lumens. OB is most commonly associated with lung transplant rejection; however, OB has also been diagnosed in workers exposed to artificial butter flavoring (ABF) vapors. Research has been limited by the lack of an adequate animal model of OB, and as a result the mechanism(s) is unclear and there are no effective treatments for this condition. Exposure of rats to the ABF component, 2,3-pentanedione (PD) results in airway lesions that are histopathologically similar to those in human OB. We used this animal model to evaluate changes in gene expression in the distal bronchi of rats with PD-induced OB. Male Wistar Han rats were exposed to 200 ppm PD or air 6 h/d, 5 d/wk for 2-wks. Bronchial tissues were laser microdissected from serial sections of frozen lung. In exposed lungs, both fibrotic and non-fibrotic airways were collected. Following RNA extraction and microarray analysis, differential gene expression was evaluated. In non-fibrotic bronchi of exposed rats, 4683 genes were significantly altered relative to air-exposed controls with notable down-regulation of many inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In contrast, in fibrotic bronchi, 3807 genes were significantly altered with a majority of genes being up-regulated in affected pathways. Tgf-Î²2 and downstream genes implicated in fibrosis were significantly up-regulated in fibrotic lesions. Genes for collagens and extracellular matrix proteins were highly up-regulated. In addition, expression of genes for peptidases and peptidase inhibitors were significantly altered, indicative of the tissue remodeling that occurs during airway fibrosis. Our data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of OB. This new information is of potential significance with regard to future therapeutic targets for treatment.
4,4'-Methylenedianiline (4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane; DAPM) is an aromatic diamine used in the production of numerous polyurethane foams and epoxy resins. Previous studies in rats revealed that DAPM initially injures biliary epithelial cells of the liver, that the toxicity is greater in female than in male rats, and that the toxic metabolites of DAPM are excreted into bile. Since male and female rats exhibit differences in the expression of both phase I and phase II enzymes, our hypothesis was that female rats either metabolize DAPM to more toxic metabolites or have a decreased capacity to conjugate metabolites to less toxic intermediates. Our objective was thus to isolate, characterize, and quantify DAPM metabolites excreted into bile in both male and female bile duct-cannulated Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were gavaged with [(14)C]-DAPM, and the collected bile was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC with radioisotope detection. Peaks eluting from HPLC were collected and analyzed using electrospray MS and NMR spectroscopy. HPLC analysis indicated numerous metabolites in both sexes, but male rats excreted greater amounts of glutathione and glucuronide conjugates than females. Electrospray MS and NMR spectra of HPLC fractions revealed that the most prominent metabolite found in bile of both sexes was a glutathione conjugate of an imine metabolite of a 4'-nitroso-DAPM. Seven other metabolites were identified, including acetylated, cysteinyl-glycine, glutamyl-cysteine, glycine, and glucuronide conjugates. While our prior studies demonstrated increased covalent binding of DAPM in the liver and bile of female compared to male rats, in these studies, SDS-PAGE with autoradiography revealed 4-5 radiolabeled protein bands in the bile of rats treated with [(14)C]-DAPM. In addition, these bands were much more prominent in female than in male rats. These studies thus suggest that a plausible mechanism for the increased sensitivity of female rats to DAPM toxicity may be decreased conjugation of reactive DAPM metabolites, leading to greater levels of protein adduct formation.
During five years of self-medication with Prednisone, a forty-one-year old asthmatic businessman experienced periods of euphoria, psychomotor hyperactivity, and poor judgement; a period of depression and anxiety during temporary steroid withdrawal; and finally, with resumption of Prednisone, episodes of grandiosity and bizarre fugue-like behavior, with adoption of a second identity and culminating in an irrational crime. Steroids were then withdrawn, and the patient resumed his premorbid personality, but had amnesia for much of his previous behavior. The literature on hysterical fugues and corticosteroid-induced mental disturbance is reviewed. The patient's reactions are analyzed in terms of his premorbid neurotic conflicts, the psychological stresses acting upon him, and the effects of Prednisone on his central nervous system.
The reversal of heparin by protamine may cause severe hemodynamic deterioration, characterized by systemic hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, and bronchoconstriction. A case report is presented concerning the administration of ketanserin in the treatment of pulmonary vasoconstriction and right ventricular failure following the infusion of protamine in a patient undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery and mitral valve replacement. The potential role of serotonin in the development of this serious complication is discussed.
When reinterpreted, data from Ahmed and Koob [Ahmed, S.H., Koob, G.F., Transition from moderate to excessive drug intake: Change in hedonic set point. Science 1998; 282:298-301.] show that the reinforcing strength of cocaine, an inessential good, increases with experience. However, no such effect obtains with a homeostatically regulated good such as food. The present study evaluated whether this difference could serve to distinguish abused drugs from biologically necessary goods. In Experiment 1, five rats from Christensen, Silberberg, Hursh, Huntsberry and Riley [Christensen, C.J., Silberberg, A., Hursh, S.R., Huntsberry, M.E., Riley, A.L., Essential value of cocaine and food in rats: tests of the exponential model of demand. Psychopharmacology 2008;198(2):221-229.] earned cocaine under a Fixed-Ratio 3 schedule for 7 sessions. Thereafter, in a demand procedure identical to that in Christensen et al., demand was re-assessed by measuring consumption at Fixed Ratios between 3 and 560. In Experiment 2, five different rats from Christensen et al. had their food demand curves re-determined using an identical procedure as the first. When fit with the exponential model, the second determination of cocaine demand in Experiment 1 showed greater essential value than the first, indicating that strength increased with cocaine exposure. In Experiment 2, the re-determined food demand curves showed no change from their initial determination. These results show that the strength of cocaine, but not food, increases with increased experience. Measures of time-based changes in essential value may serve as a basis for distinguishing addictive from non-addictive reinforcers.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and frequently fatal form of interstitial lung disease for which there are no proven drug therapies. The pathogenesis of IPF is complex and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/plasminogen system participates in the repair process. The balance between the activating enzyme uPA, and its inhibitor PAI-1, is a critical determinant of the amount of scar development that follows.
To address the role of urokinase in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and its implications for therapy.
We reviewed a spectrum of therapeutic strategies and focused on fibrinolytic and anticoagulant drugs for IPF patients.
There is currently a search for new pharmacotherapeutic agents that may modulate the fibrogenic pathways in IPF. Either blocking PAI-1 or using uPA itself may be a promising new therapeutic strategy.
Primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. So far, genetic studies of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome have relied mostly on candidate gene approaches. To identify new genetic susceptibility loci for primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, we performed a three-stage genome-wide association study in Han Chinese. In the discovery stage, we analyzed 556,134 autosomal SNPs in 542 cases and 1,050 controls. We then validated promising associations in 2 replication stages comprising 1,303 cases and 2,727 controls. The combined analysis identified GTF2I at 7q11.23 (rs117026326: Pcombined = 1.31 Ã 10(-53), combined odds ratio (ORcombined) = 2.20) as a new susceptibility locus for primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. Our analysis also confirmed previously reported associations in Europeans in the regions of STAT4, TNFAIP3 and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Fine mapping of the region around GTF2I showed that rs117026326 in GTF2I had the most significant association, with associated SNPs extending from GTF2I to GTF2IRD1-GTF2I.
SjÃ¶gren's syndrome is a common autoimmune disease (affecting â¼0.7% of European Americans) that typically presents as keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. Here we report results of a large-scale association study of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. In addition to strong association within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region at 6p21 (Pmeta = 7.65 Ã 10(-114)), we establish associations with IRF5-TNPO3 (Pmeta = 2.73 Ã 10(-19)), STAT4 (Pmeta = 6.80 Ã 10(-15)), IL12A (Pmeta = 1.17 Ã 10(-10)), FAM167A-BLK (Pmeta = 4.97 Ã 10(-10)), DDX6-CXCR5 (Pmeta = 1.10 Ã 10(-8)) and TNIP1 (Pmeta = 3.30 Ã 10(-8)). We also observed suggestive associations (Pmeta < 5 Ã 10(-5)) with variants in 29 other regions, including TNFAIP3, PTTG1, PRDM1, DGKQ, FCGR2A, IRAK1BP1, ITSN2 and PHIP, among others. These results highlight the importance of genes that are involved in both innate and adaptive immunity in SjÃ¶gren's syndrome.
This study was performed, in a multi-institutional setting, to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the Stanford V chemotherapy regimen plus radiotherapy to bulky Hodgkin's disease sites.
A two-stage design was implemented in a phase II study involving 47 patients with bulky mediastinal stage I/II or stage III/IV Hodgkin's disease. Twelve weeks of the Stanford V chemotherapy regimen were given with consolidative radiotherapy (36 Gy) to lymph nodes >/= 5 cm and/or macroscopic splenic disease. Treatment was administered in one of five institutions participating in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.
With a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 45 patients are alive and 40 have been continuously disease-free. The estimated freedom from progression was 87% at 2 years and 85% at 5 years. Overall survival was 96% at 2 and 5 years. There was one death from Hodgkin's disease and one death from an M5 acute leukemia. Six of seven relapsed patients received high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation. The freedom from second progression for the seven relapsed patients was estimated at 98% at 3 years.
Stanford V chemotherapy and consolidative radiotherapy to bulky disease is effective in bulky and advanced Hodgkin's disease in a multi-institutional setting. On this basis, an Intergroup study comparing doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine with the Stanford V regimen has been initiated.
To report a case of cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, discuss prevention, and review treatment options, particularly the use of intravesicular prostaglandins.
Literature obtained through a computerized search, with subsequent bibliography scanning. Information on the individual case was obtained from the patient's medical record and the Pharmacy Clinical Research Specialist.
A 29-year-old woman who had a postallogeneic bone marrow transplantation was hospitalized because of graft-versus-host disease. During hospitalization, she developed a cyclophosphamide-induced hematuria that, despite hydration and transfusions of blood products, progressed to refractory hemorrhagic cystitis. A response was prompted ultimately by a regimen consisting of continuous bladder irrigation and intermittent intravesical instillation of carboprost.
The best treatment for hemorrhagic cystitis remains prevention. Therapies for established cystitis are varied; the choice depends on the degree of hematuria present. Therapies are often temporary or ineffective, and themselves cause significant morbidity. One promising treatment option involves the intravesicular administration of prostaglandins. Reports in the literature discuss a variety of products, dosages, and treatment schedules that have been used with some success. The available data on this technique are presented.
Prostaglandins appear to be effective in resolving established hemorrhagic cystitis; however, their place in therapy remains unclear. Before this class can be employed routinely, several basic issues remain. These include optimal dosage, dosing schedule, duration of treatment, and comparative efficacy with other agents.
The aim of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective activity of vitamin E against doxorubicin alone and doxorubicin in combination with cyclophosphamide in mice. Female BalbC/NIH mice were treated with vitamin E (100 IU/kg, orally) 24 hr before single bolus doses of doxorubicin (10 mg/kg, intravenously), or doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Non-treated animals served as negative controls, while positive control groups received doxorubicin or doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. For evaluation, serum enzyme activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehidrogenase (LDH), alpha-hydroxybutirate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH), and creatine kinase (CK) at 48 hr and histopathology examination of the heart tissue (Billigham rules) at 1.5 and 3 months followed to treatments were used. In sera of mice treated with vitamin E prior to doxorubicin, the creatine kinase and % alpha-HBDH activity were significantly reduced, compared to positive control. Histopathology changes (scored as 1.5 at 1.5 and 3 months respectively) were not significant compared to negative control at both time points of examination. In animals which received vitamin E before doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, none of the serum enzymes was significantly reduced compared to positive control, but non-significant increase in AST and creatine kinase activity was detected (3% and 16.57% respectively). The degree of myocardial damage was significantly higher compared to non-treated group (2.0 and 2.5 at 1.5 and 3 months respectively). Current results show that vitamin E in single oral dose failed to inhibit acute cardiotoxic activity of doxorubicin, but suspended further progression of the heart muscle damage over the time. On the contrary, vitamin E did not attain any cardioprotection against doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in combination.
Triglycerides are transported in plasma by specific triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; in epidemiological studies, increased triglyceride levels correlate with higher risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, it is unclear whether this association reflects causal processes. We used 185 common variants recently mapped for plasma lipids (P < 5 Ã 10(-8) for each) to examine the role of triglycerides in risk for CAD. First, we highlight loci associated with both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, and we show that the direction and magnitude of the associations with both traits are factors in determining CAD risk. Second, we consider loci with only a strong association with triglycerides and show that these loci are also associated with CAD. Finally, in a model accounting for effects on LDL-C and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, the strength of a polymorphism's effect on triglyceride levels is correlated with the magnitude of its effect on CAD risk. These results suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins causally influence risk for CAD.
We have studied the effects of three antioxidants and amrinone, an inotropic agent, against vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats by investigating renal function and morphology. Thirty adult female Sprague Dawley rats (168-234 g) were divided into six groups. A saline-treated group served as control. The other five groups were treated for 7 days with vancomycin alone or in combination with alpha-lipoic acid, Ginkgo biloba extract 761, melatonin or amrinone. On day 8, all the rats were sacrificed by decapitation, kidney tissues were excised immediately and blood and kidney samples were collected. Blood urea and creatinine, kidney tissue malondialdehyde levels, and kidney superoxide dismutase and glutathione (GSH) peroxidase activities were measured. The kidneys were also examined for histological changes. Vancomycin administration led to increased urea, creatinine and malondialdehyde levels and decreased superoxide dismutase and GSH peroxidase activities. Co-administration of alpha-lipoic acid, Ginkgo biloba extract, melatonin or amrinone with vancomycin prevented the increases in the urea, creatinine and melondialdehyde levels and also resulted in higher superoxide dismutase and GSH peroxidase activities. The antioxidants and AMR improved the renal pathology compared to rats treated with vancomycin alone (P<0.05). These results indicate that the three antioxidants and amrinone have potential protective effects against vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity, which might in part be due to inhibition of free oxygen radical production. Amrinone was the most effective drug as judged on the basis of the pathological findings.
A prospective randomized trial of 62 patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck was conducted to compare the effectiveness of our standard chemotherapy program with that of our test regimen. The standard chemotherapy regimen consisted of cisplatin 80 mg/M2 on day 1 followed by 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/M2 days 2 through 6. Our test regimen consisted of the same two drugs plus 15 U bleomycin on day 1 and methotrexate 100 mg/M2 on day 16 followed in 24 hours with 15 mg leucovorin every 6 hours for six doses. One patient in each arm of the study was not evaluated. Among 29 patients receiving the two-drug regimen, there was 1 complete response and 10 partial responses (38% response rate). Among 31 patients receiving the four-drug regimen, there were 3 complete responses and 16 partial responses (61% response rate; two vs. four-drug regimen, P = .06). The failure-free survival in the four-drug group was better than the two-drug group, median 4.5 vs. 2.3 months (P = .02). The overall survival for both groups was the same (median of 7.8 months). A detailed analysis of toxicity did not reveal any important differences between the two regimens. The addition of bleomycin and methotrexate to our cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil regimen resulted in an increase in effectiveness without adding toxicity.
This study evaluated the effect of nicardipine, calcium channel blocker, monotherapy on blood pressure and metabolic changes. Various aspect of carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism were studied before and after 12 weeks of nicardipine treatment in 23 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Nicardipine was well tolerated and induced a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without any changes in heart rate. Plasma levels of fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide and hemoglobin A1c, hepatic extraction of insulin were similar following nicardipine treatment. Plasma glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge did not change in association with nicardipine therapy. Although high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration increased slightly, it did not reach statistical significance. Total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels also increased insignificantly. LDL triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride concentrations were higher marginally, which resulted in slightly but insignificantly increase in total triglyceride concentration in association with nicardipine monotherapy for 12 weeks. In conclusion, treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension with nicardipine led to lower blood pressure effectively while had no significant influence on carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism.
Chloroform causes hepatic and renal toxicity in a number of species. In vitro studies have indicated that chloroform can be metabolized by P450 enzymes in the kidney to nephrotoxic intermediate, although direct in vivo evidence for the role of renal P450 in the nephrotoxicity has not been reported. This study was to determine whether chloroform renal toxicity persists in a mouse model with a liver-specific deletion of the P450 reductase (Cpr) gene (liver-Cpr-null). Chloroform-induced renal toxicity and chloroform tissue levels were compared between the liver-Cpr-null and wild-type mice at 24 h following differing doses of chloroform. At a chloroform dose of 150 mg/kg, the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were five times higher in the exposed group than in the vehicle-treated one for the liver-Cpr-null mice, but they were only slightly higher in the exposed group than in the vehicle-treated group for the wild-type mice. Severe lesions were found in the kidney of the liver-Cpr-null mice, while only mild lesions were found in the wild-type mice. At a chloroform dose of 300 mg/kg, severe kidney lesions were observed in both strains, yet the BUN levels were still higher in the liver-Cpr-null than in the wild-type mice. Higher chloroform levels were found in the tissues of the liver-Cpr-null mice. These findings indicated that loss of hepatic P450-dependent chloroform metabolism does not protect against chloroform-induced renal toxicity, suggesting that renal P450 enzymes play an essential role in chloroform renal toxicity.
We report a patient in whom hypersensitivity to carbamazepine presented with generalized erythroderma, a severe leukemoid reaction, eosinophilia, hyponatremia, and renal failure. This is the first report of such an unusual reaction to carbamazepine.
Bioscavengers are molecules able to neutralize neurotoxic organophosphorus compounds (OP) before they can reach their biological target. Human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) is a natural bioscavenger each molecule of enzyme neutralizing one molecule of OP. The amount of natural enzyme is insufficient to achieve good protection. Thus, different strategies have been envisioned. The most straightforward consists in injecting a large dose of highly purified natural hBChE to increase the amount of bioscavenger in the bloodstream. This proved to be successful for protection against lethal doses of soman and VX but remains expensive. An improved strategy is to regenerate prophylactic cholinesterases (ChE) by administration of reactivators after exposure. But broad-spectrum efficient reactivators are still lacking, especially for inhibited hBChE. Cholinesterase mutants capable of reactivating spontaneously are another option. The G117H hBChE mutant has been a prototype. We present here the Y124H/Y72D mutant of human acetylcholinesterase; its spontaneous reactivation rate after V-agent inhibition is increased up to 110 fold. Catalytic bioscavengers, enzymes capable of hydrolyzing OP, present the best alternative. Mesophilic bacterial phosphotriesterase (PTE) is a candidate with good catalytic efficiency. Its enantioselectivity has been enhanced against the most potent OP isomers by rational design. We show that PEGylation of this enzyme improves its mean residence time in the rat blood stream 24-fold and its bioavailability 120-fold. Immunogenic issues remain to be solved. Human paraoxonase 1 (hPON1) is another promising candidate. However, its main drawback is that its phosphotriesterase activity is highly dependent on its environment. Recent progress has been made using a mammalian chimera of PON1, but we provide here additional data showing that this chimera is biochemically different from hPON1. Besides, the chimera is expected to suffer from immunogenic issues. Thus, we stress that interest for hPON1 must not fade away, and in particular, the 3D structure of the hPON1 eventually in complex with OP has to be solved.
All natural cardiac glycosides (CG) have a hydroxyl (OH) group attached to carbon 14 (C 14) of the steroid nucleus which has been considered important for their pharmacological action. To investigate the relation between chemical structure and biological activity of CG, we studied the cardiac effects of a semisynthetic derivative if gluco-digitoxigenin that lacks the C 14 hydroxyl group; the compound was named Dig-3 and corresponds to the number of a series of semisynthetic glycosides being studied. On the failing heart of the Starling's heart-lung preparation Dig-3 reverts experimental cardiac failure. Electrophysiological experiments in anesthetized dogs (morphine chloralose) have shown that Dig-3 shortens the functional refractory period of the ordinary atrial myocardium (OAM), and lengthens that of the specialized atrial tissue (SAT). The basal excitability is reduced in both tissues, however OAM is more susceptible to Dig-3 action. The conduction velocity of impulses in SAT diminishes 50% with one tenth of the lethal dose (LD) of Dig-3 whereas in the OAM, an equivalent decrease is achieved with 60% of LD. A-V dissociation induced by the infusion of toxic doses of Dig-3 reverted to sinus rhythm in about 6 min after the administration was stopped. We conclude that the presence of the OH group attached to C 14 of digitalis molecule does not constitute a structural requirement for the preservation of its inotropic and electrophysiological actions on the heart, although its potency is greatly diminished.
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between aspirin resistance, ischaemic stroke subtype, stroke severity, and inflammatory cytokines. Aspirin resistance was assessed by thrombelastography in 45 people with ischaemic stroke and 25 controls. Plasma interleukin (IL)-6 was measured. Stroke severity was assessed using the modified Rankin scale and National Institute of Health Stroke Score within 72 h of stroke. Aspirin resistance was more common in the stroke than the control group (67% versus 40%, P=0.028), and within the stroke group the aspirin-resistant group had a higher Rankin score (4.0 versus 2.0, P=0.013). Aspirin resistance was greater in lacunar than embolic strokes (platelet activation 79% versus 59%, P=0.020). The stroke aspirin-resistant group had higher levels of IL-6 than the stroke aspirin-sensitive group (2.4+/-1 versus 1.8+/-0.9 ng/mL, P=0.037). Using multivariate analysis, we examined the interrelationships between aspirin resistance, IL-6, and stroke severity. These analyses showed that IL-6 was independently associated with stroke severity as the outcome (B=3.738, P=0.036), and aspirin resistance was independently associated with IL-6 (B=0.765, P=0.005) as the outcome. In conclusion, aspirin resistance is related to stroke severity and aspirin resistance is more common in lacunar strokes than embolic strokes.
A 17-year-old adolescent female presented to a psychiatric emergency room with excitement, confusion, and psychotic symptoms. After brief exposure to haloperidol and olanzapine, she developed fever, rigidity, waxy flexibility, autonomic instability, and elevated creatinine phosphokinase enzyme. Approximately 6 weeks after the onset of the illness, multiple laboratory tests, and evaluation at three different hospitals, the condition was effectively treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This case is a lesson in delayed recognition and the delayed use of ECT for the malignant catatonia/neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
