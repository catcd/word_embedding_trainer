In five multicentre field trials, the efficacy and safety of a combination of oxantel/pyrantel/praziquantel (Dolpac), Vetoquinol SA) in the treatment of naturally acquired gastrointestinal nematode and/or cestode infestation in dogs was evaluated in northern and southern Europe. Forty-eight investigators from France, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Spain enrolled 329 dogs to be treated with the tested combination; 235 of these dogs complied with the inclusion criteria of the protocol and had a tested helminth identified on Day 0. A pooled analysis was performed on each of the following helminth species: Toxocara canis, Ancylostoma caninum, Toxascaris leonina, Trichuris vulpis, Uncinaria stenocephala, Taenia spp. and Dipylidium caninum, which were isolated on Day 0. The main efficacy criterion was the egg per gram (epg) percent reduction of the nematodes and the absence of proglottids and or eggs for the cestodes. After treatment, dogs were examined on Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21. The efficacy of the combination against Toxocara canis was 99.1%, 98.8% and 98.9% on Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21, respectively. At the same occasions the efficacy was, respectively, 99.2%, 99.2% and 99.3% against Ancylostoma caninum, 97.3%, 97.2% and 98.4% against Trichuris vulpis, 98.4%, 98.8% and 98.8% against Uncinaria stenocephala, 98.9%, 99.5% and 99.9% against Toxascaris leonina, 97.1%, 100% and 100% against Dipylidium caninum and 100% against Taenia spp.
Moderate consumption of wine is associated with a reduced risk of cancer. Grape plant cell cultures were used to purify 12 phenols: the stilbenoids trans-astringin, trans-piceid (2), trans-resveratroloside, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceatannol, cis-resveratroloside, cis-piceid, and cis-resveratrol; the flavans (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and epicatechin 3-O-gallate; and the flavan dimer procyanidin B2 3'-O-gallate. These compounds were evaluated for potential to inhibit cyclooxygenases and preneoplastic lesion formation in carcinogen-treated mouse mammary glands in organ culture. At 10 micrograms/ml, trans-astringin and trans-piceatannol inhibited development of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced preneoplastic lesions in mouse mammary glands with 68.8% and 76.9% inhibition, respectively, compared with untreated glands. The latter compound was the most potent of the 12 compounds tested in this assay, with the exception of trans-resveratrol (87.5% inhibition). In the cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 assay, trans isomers of the stilbenoids appear to be more active than cis isomers: trans-resveratrol [50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 14.9 microM, 96%] vs. cis-resveratrol (IC50 = 55.4 microM). In the COX-2 assay, among the compounds tested, only trans- and cis-resveratrol exhibited significant inhibitory activity (IC50 = 32.2 and 50.2 microM, respectively). This is the first report showing the potential cancer-chemopreventive activity of trans-astringin, a plant stilbenoid recently found in wine. trans-Astringin and its aglycone trans-piceatannol were active in the mouse mammary gland organ culture assay but did not exhibit activity in COX-1 and COX-2 assays. trans-Resveratrol was active in all three of the bioassays used in this investigation. These findings suggest that trans-astringin and trans-piceatannol may function as potential cancer-chemopreventive agents by a mechanism different from that of trans-resveratrol.
Large clinical studies assessing long-term adefovir dipivoxil salvage monotherapy in patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are lacking, particularly in patients positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). We assessed the efficacy and resistance profile of adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy for up to 5 years in a large cohort of Korean patients with lamivudine-resistant CHB.
A total of 320 patients (81.3% HBeAg-positive; 100% genotype C) with confirmed genotypic lamivudine-resistant CHB were switched to adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily. Liver function tests and HBV DNA were monitored every 3 months. Genotypic resistance to adefovir dipivoxil was performed in patients with detectable HBV DNA.
The overall cumulative virological response rate at 5 years of adefovir dipivoxil therapy was 48.8%. The virological response rate was significantly higher in HBeAg-negative patients (62.0% versus 45.9%; P=0.010). Most cases of virological response (131/134, 97.8%) occurred within the first 36 months of therapy. The 5-year cumulative probability of genotypic resistance and virological breakthrough was 65.6% and 61.8%, respectively. Predictive factors for a virological response included baseline HBeAg seronegativity, HBV DNA< or =8 log(10) copies/ml and achievement of an on-treatment initial virological response.
Adefovir dipivoxil salvage monotherapy for lamivudine-resistant CHB resulted in a modest cumulative virological response rate at 5 years, which was associated with progressive antiviral resistance. Consequently, adefovir monotherapy is not preferable as a first-line strategy for lamivudine resistance where combination lamivudine plus adefovir dipivoxil therapy is available.
Allergic rhinitis is an inflammatory disorder associated with local leukotriene release during periods of symptoms. Therefore, it has been suggested that antileukotrienes may be beneficial in the treatment of this disease. Leukotriene receptor antagonists have recently become available for asthma treatment, but little is known of their effects on allergic rhinitis. We have evaluated the effects of the leukotriene receptor antagonist zafirlukast versus placebo in patients with allergic rhinitis during the grass pollen season, using the nasal glucocorticoid beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) as a positive treatment control. Thirty-three patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion randomized to treatments with oral zafirlukast (20 mg twice a day), intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate (200 microg twice a day), or placebo. The treatment was initiated 3 wk prior to the expected beginning of the grass pollen season. Patients completed a daily symptom-score list for sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itch, and nasal blockage during the 50-d treatment period. Nasal biopsies for quantification of local tissue eosinophilia (immunohistochemistry; EG2) were taken 1 mo before initiation of treatment and immediately after the peak of grass pollen season. Patients receiving treatment with zafirlukast had degrees of nasal symptoms similar to those in the placebo group, whereas the BDP group had significantly less symptoms compared with both treatments (p = 0.01 and p = 0.005, respectively). The numbers of activated eosinophils in the nasal tissue increased significantly during the pollen season in both the zafirlukast and the placebo groups, but not in the BDP group. These results obtained with a limited number of patients do not support any clinical efficacy of regular treatment with an oral antileukotriene in seasonal allergic rhinitis but rather favor the use of a nasal glucocorticoid.
We report a patient with reversible acute oligoanuric renal failure. Intravenous mannitol 25% was infused to treat intracranial edema, during chronic administration of ACE inhibitors for arterial hypertension. Serum creatinine level rose to 5.6 mg/dl from a previous value of 1.2 mg/dl. Measured and calculated serum osmolalities were 310 and 280 mosm/kg respectively. We postulate that the association of afferent arteriolar constriction due to mannitol induced tubulo-glomerular imbalance and efferent dilatation due to ACE inhibitors provoked a sharp reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Alternatively, mannitol infusion may have caused tubular cell swelling with luminal obstruction.
The records of 314 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were reviewed to determine the frequency, clinical and laboratory features; contributing factors; and prognosis of cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Twenty-five well-documented cases of hemorrhagic cystitis were identified. While most of the affected children suffered a mild transient illness, 1 patient died as a result of bladder hemorrhage. The doses of cyclophosphamide received by these children ranged widely and did not correlate with the severity of the cystitis. The frequency of this complication did not differ significantly with sex, age or route of administration. However, cystitis was over twice as frequent in black children as in white. Nineteen of 25 cases occurred in the spring and summer months. The group of affected children did not differ significantly from a matched control group in terms of total drug dosage received, incidence of systemic toxicity, mean urine specific gravity, or overall survival.
The present study has examined the glycine/N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, L-701-324 [7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-(3-phenoxy)-phenyl-2 (H)quinolone] in rodent behavioral tests commonly used to predict antipsychotic potential and side effect liability in humans. Pretreatment with L-701,324 dose-dependently antagonized amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in the mouse (ED50 = 1.12 +/- 0.45 mg/kg p.o.), an effect which was similar to that of the classical neuroleptic, haloperidol, and the atypical neuroleptic, clozapine. In addition, p.o. administration of L-701,324 (2.5 or 5 mg/kg) attenuated the hyperactivity response induced by amphetamine infusion into the rat nucleus accumbens. In contrast to haloperidol, however, stereotyped sniffing and licking/biting, induced by either the systemic administration of apomorphine or infusion of amphetamine into the striatum, was not altered in rats pretreated with L-701,324 (30 or 100 mg/kg p.o.). Furthermore, L-701,324 failed to impair spontaneous locomotor activity or induce catalepsy in the mouse at doses > or = 100 mg/kg. Although a significant reduction in spontaneous activity was observed in rats pretreated with L-701,324, the minimum effective dose (10 mg/kg p.o.) was 2-fold greater than that which abolished amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in this species. Thus, L-701,324 selectively blocks behaviors associated with the activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system suggesting that glycine/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists may offer a novel approach to the treatment of schizophrenia in humans.
The activities of both sarcolemmal (SL) Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, which maintain the intracellular cation homeostasis, have been shown to be depressed in heart failure due to myocardial infarction (MI). Because the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is activated in heart failure, this study tested the hypothesis that attenuation of cardiac SL changes in congestive heart failure (CHF) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with prevention of alterations in gene expression for SL Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. CHF in rats due to MI was induced by occluding the coronary artery, and 3 wk later the animals were treated with an ACE inhibitor, imidapril (1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), for 4 wk. Heart dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy in the infarcted animals were associated with depressed SL Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange activities. Protein content and mRNA levels for Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger as well as Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta(1)-isoforms were depressed, whereas those for alpha(3)-isoform were increased in the failing heart. These changes in SL activities, protein content, and gene expression were attenuated by treating the infarcted animals with imidapril. The beneficial effects of imidapril treatment on heart function and cardiac hypertrophy as well as SL Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange activities in the infarcted animals were simulated by enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, and losartan, an angiotensin receptor antagonist. These results suggest that blockade of RAS in CHF improves SL Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange activities in the failing heart by preventing changes in gene expression for SL proteins.
The plasma potassium responses to 1 week's treatment with metolazone 0.625 mg, 1.25 mg and 2.5 mg in combination with spironolactone 50 mg, and metolazone 2.5 alone were examined in a double-blind, crossover study in twelve healthy subjects. Spironolactone attenuated the hypokalaemia induced by metolazone--addition of spironolactone 50 mg to metolazone 2.5 mg raised plasma potassium by 0.18 mmol/l (P less than 0.025). In the presence of spironolactone, a linear log metolazone dose-plasma potassium response relationship (P less than 0.01) was demonstrated. Spironolactone was unable to compensate fully for metolazone's hypokalaemic effect although in combination with metolazone 0.625 mg and 1.25 mg, plasma potassium concentration was maintained close to pretreatment levels. The human bioassay employed provided conveniently quantitative information which allows the rational development of a fixed dose diuretic-spironolactone combination tablet.
The pharmacokinetics of metoclopramide have been studied in nine children receiving the drug as prophylaxis for cytotoxic induced vomiting. Plasma concentrations of metoclopramide have also been studied in three children with dystonic reactions to the drug. The pharmacokinetics in children were similar to those reported in healthy adults. There was no difference in the plasma concentration of metoclopramide of children with dystonia when compared to those without this adverse effect. Kinetic differences in childhood do not explain the occurrence of dystonia, which in the individual appears to be related to factors other than plasma drug concentrations.
Relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior depends on increased glutamate transmission in key regions of the mesocorticolimbic motive circuit, including prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Because GLT1 is responsible for the uptake of >or=90% of extracellular glutamate, we tested the hypothesis that increased GLT1 expression attenuates cocaine relapse. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.125 mg per intravenous infusion) in a lever-pressing task in a daily 2 h session for 10-14 d followed by 5 d of extinction training. Immediately after each extinction session, rats received ceftriaxone (intraperitoneally), a beta-lactam antibiotic believed to increase GLT1 expression, or vehicle. On the following day, presentation of the cue (light and tone) previously associated with cocaine self-administration reinstated lever pressing in rats treated with vehicle, whereas 100 or 200, but not 50 mg/kg ceftriaxone blocked this response. Immunoblotting confirmed that the ceftriaxone-induced blockade of cocaine relapse was associated with an increase in GLT1 expression in both PFC and NAcc. In separate groups of rats, 200 mg/kg ceftriaxone failed to block cue-induced food seeking, arguing against a ceftriaxone-induced effect unique to extinction training or lever pressing. Our results suggest that glutamate plays a key role in cue-induced relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior, implicating GLT1 as a potential therapeutic target for cocaine addiction.
Cocaine use has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Patients may present having ingested cocaine for elective or emergent operative procedures. We report a case of acute myocardial ischemia in a young healthy male patient.
We report a patient who presented with the classical features of fenoprofen-induced nephropathy. Initial response to a cessation of the drug and prednisone therapy was recovery of renal function, but proteinuria persisted. One year later, he experienced recurrence of the nephrotic syndrome with sustained renal failure. A clear progression from minimal-change lesions to focal glomerulosclerosis was shown in sequential renal biopsies. Not previously reported, this evolution is suggestive of the possibility that fenoprofen nephropathy may lead to chronic renal failure.
A case of halothane induced hepatitis is reported in a middle aged woman who underwent gastric surgery for morbid obesity. The abnormalities in her liver function tests included a progressive rise in bilirubin level over five weeks. Prompt resolution of her jaundice followed the initiation of methionine therapy.
Reports of fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction have described orgasmic and erectile difficulties but have neglected possible changes in sexual desire. This prospective study was undertaken to determine the percentages of patients experiencing different types of sexual dysfunction after successful antidepressant treatment with standard doses of fluoxetine. Additionally, an open trial of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocker yohimbine as a potential treatment for fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction was conducted in nine patients.
Over a 2-year period, outpatients who had fulfilled DSM-III-R criteria for major depression and subsequently responded to treatment with fluoxetine 20-40 mg were asked to report and describe changes in sexual function. A small number of consecutive nongeriatric patients complaining of new onset sexual dysfunction were invited to participate in an open trial of yohimbine 5.4 mg t.i.d.
Fifty-four (34%) of 160 outpatients reported the onset of sexual dysfunction after successful treatment with fluoxetine: 16 (10%) of the 160 patients reported decreased libido, 21 (13%) patients reported decreased sexual response, and 17 (11%) patients reported declines in both areas. Eight of nine patients reported improvement in sexual function with yohimbine, although five patients reported side effects that led to discontinuation in two cases.
These findings suggest that (1) fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction may include decreased sexual desire as well as decreased physical functioning and may occur more frequently than previously appreciated and (2) fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction may be treatable with yohimbine.
Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) metabolizes the paralytic succinylcholine. Extended paralysis occurs in people with inherited BChE variants that may be identified by measuring BChE activity with and without the inhibitor dibucaine to calculate a dibucaine number (DN). Accurate phenotyping requires phenotype-specific BChE and DN reference intervals. We investigated the concordance between the biochemical BChE phenotype and the BCHE genotype to establish interpretive criteria for biochemical results. DNA was extracted from 45 serum specimens for which BChE activity and DN had been determined. The BCHE gene coding region was amplified and sequenced. Phenotype-genotype concordance and discordance occurred in 16 (36%) and 15 (33%) of specimens, respectively. A phenotype could not be assigned for 14 specimens (31%). An incorrectly assigned phenotype did not change the risk of prolonged paralysis or implied a slightly increased risk when there was none. Accurate BChE phenotyping is difficult using only enzyme activity and DN. The combination of biochemistry and BCHE genotype could improve the assessment of patient risk.
The effect of testosterone on brain excitability is unclear. The excitatory aspect of testosterone's action in the brain may be due to its conversion to estrogen via aromatase. We report herein a 61-year-old man with temporal lobe epilepsy and sexual dysfunction due to low testosterone levels. Use of an aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, normalized his testosterone level and improved his sexual functioning. Letrozole, in addition to standard antiseizure medication, was also associated with improved seizure control. This was sustained and, further, was associated with seizure exacerbation after withdrawing letrozole, and subsequent seizure improvement after restarting it. During the course of treatment, his serum testosterone level increased, sex hormone-binding globulin decreased (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels increased, while serum estradiol levels remained undetectable. Letrozole may, therefore, have produced a central alteration in the testosterone/estrogen ratio, thereby impairing estrogen-mediated feedback control of the pituitary, resulting in the observed increase in circulating LH and FSH levels. This experience suggests that aromatase inhibitors should be further investigated as a beneficial treatment modality for male patients with epilepsy.
Overexposure to manganese (Mn) has been known to induce neuronal damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of Mn are still incompletely understood but seem to involve endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The current study investigated whether ER stress signaling was involved in Mn-induced neurotoxicity in organotypic brain slices. After the brain slices were respectively exposed to 400μM Mn for 0, 6, 12, 18, 24h, there was a time-dependent increase in apoptotic cell death in slices and levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture medium. Moreover, Mn was found to upregulate GRP78/94, CHOP and caspase-12 expression. Furthermore, PERK phosphorylation, PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2a and ATF4 mRNA expression increased. IRE1 activation and Xbp1 mRNA splicing also increased. However, ATF6 p90 levels did not change. The findings clearly demonstrated that Mn induced the ER stress via activation of PERK and IRE1 signaling pathway, which contributed to the occurrence of apoptosis in cultured slices.
The centrally acting antihypertensive drug clonidine has been found to stimulate the synthesis of PGF2 alpha in the brain. Centrally administered PGF2 alpha, in turn, induces rises of blood pressure and heart rate. We therefore studied the influence of inhibitors of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis on the cardiovascular effects of clonidine in urethane-anaesthetised rats. Pretreatment with indomethacin or paracetamol (100 micrograms/rat into the fourth cerebral ventricle) antagonised the central hypotensive effect of clonidine (0.125-16.0 micrograms/rat into the fourth cerebral ventricle). The bradycardic effect of centrally administered clonidine was, however, enhanced by pretreatment with paracetamol but not influenced by indomethacin pretreatment. Sodium meclofenamate (100 micrograms/rat into the fourth cerebral ventricle) did not significantly affect the clonidine-induced changes in blood pressure and heart rate. These results suggest that the clonidine-induced hypotension on one hand and bradycardia on the other hand may be mediated by partly different mechanisms. An interference of the formation of PGF2 alpha with the cardiovascular effects of clonidine cannot be completely excluded since paracetamol pretreatment potentiated the bradycardic effect of clonidine. However, inhibitors of PG synthesis did not enhance but antagonised the hypotensive effect of clonidine. Therefore it is likely that the synthesis of PGF2 alpha does not interfere with the hypotensive effect of clonidine. Moreover, the antagonism of the hypotensive effect by inhibitors of PG synthesis suggests that some hypotensive metabolite of arachidonic acid in the brain could be involved in the central hypotensive effect of clonidine.
Bilateral electrolytic lesions into the red nucleus (RN) of rat elicit an increase in susceptibility to seizures induced by pilocarpine, kainic acid, isoniazid, pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline and maximal electric shock (MES). It was also observed that carbachol-induced wet-dog shakes were increased in the RN-lesioned rats. The brain acetylcholine (ACh) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations were significantly decreased in the striatum and substantia nigra, respectively. There were no changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in the RN-lesioned group compared with sham-operated rats. Based on the results it is proposed that the RN is involved in the generalization and acceleration of seizure activity through the cholinergic and GABA-ergic system.
Usher syndrome type IIa (OMIM 276901), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss and progressive retinitis pigmentosa, maps to the long arm of human chromosome 1q41 between markers AFM268ZD1 and AFM144XF2. Three biologically important mutations in Usher syndrome type IIa patients were identified in a gene (USH2A) isolated from this critical region. The USH2A gene encodes a protein with a predicted size of 171.5 kilodaltons that has laminin epidermal growth factor and fibronectin type III motifs; these motifs are most commonly observed in proteins comprising components of the basal lamina and extracellular matrixes and in cell adhesion molecules.
Although the recently-developed Gemcitabine (GEM) has renewed interest in clinical research in pancreatic carcinoma, it offers modest improvement of tumor-related symptoms and marginal survival advantage, even when combined with other currently-available chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). We hypothesized that this disappointing result could be due to an interaction between the two drugs affecting cytotoxic activity. We measured in-vitro growth inhibition, cell cycle distribution, gene and protein expression of apoptosis regulators bcl-2, bcl-x and survivin, NFkappaB and telomerase activities of human pancreatic carcinoma cell line Capan-2 following exposure to GEM and 5-FU singly or combined, by MTT assay and median effect analysis, flow cytometry, real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay, respectively. We found cell growth to be inhibited by both drugs, decreasing the percentage of cells in S and G2/M phases and inducing apoptosis, dependent on the levels of bcl-2, bcl-xL and survivin expression in the case of 5-FU, but not for GEM. Moreover, while telomerase activity was reduced equally by both drugs, 5-FU but not GEM effectively downregulated NFkappaB binding activity. Intriguingly, a substantial antagonistic effect was noticed when GEM was combined with 5-FU in the concentration range tested, with the exception of the TRAP assay. These indications of an antagonistic interaction between GEM and 5-FU in some pancreatic cancer context urge further investigation of both genetic and non-genetic differences to identify the variables most relevant for optimal selection and dosing of treatment for the individual patient.
1,3-Butanediol and phlorhizin were used to induce ketonemia and hypoglycemia in steers. Oral administration of butanediol increased blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and decreased serum glucose. Subcutaneous injections of phlorhizin, given in addition to butanediol orally, further increased NEFA and BHB concentrations and decreased glucose. Dietary niacin supplementation of steers given phlorhizin and butanediol caused serum glucose concentration to increase and blood BHB and plasma NEFA concentrations to decrease.
One-hundred-and-forty-three patients with haematological malignancy or severe aplastic anaemia received HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants. In 111 of these patients who had haematological malignancy and who were prepared for transplant with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and fractionated total body irradiation 12-14 Gy, the incidence of haemorrhagic cystitis and hepatic veno-occlusive disease was 13% and 3%, respectively. In contrast, the incidence in 15 leukaemic patients prepared for transplant with chemotherapy regimens containing high-dose busulphan was 47% and 20%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Two patients in this latter group who developed fatal veno-occlusive disease had chronic myeloid leukaemia and had received long-term low-dose busulphan pre-transplant. Neither complication occurred in 26 patients prepared by cyclophosphamide alone (20 patients with severe aplastic anaemia) or with cyclophosphamide and melphalan (six patients with leukaemia). The regimen of busulphan 16 mg/kg in combination with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg was associated with a short duration of total leucopenia with a significantly higher leucocyte count on the day of marrow transplant compared to other regimens. Furthermore, oro-pharyngeal mucositis was not severe even when methotrexate was utilised as post-transplant prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease. Thus, while the busulphan-cyclophosphamide regimen appeared useful, we suggest that (1) high-dose busulphan should not be used as a preparative regimen for patients previously exposed to busulphan, and (2) bladder irrigation (as well as intravenous hydration) is necessary to minimise haemorrhagic cystitis in patients given regimens that incorporate high-dose busulphan.
Estrogen receptors (ERs) are known to mediate important physiologic responses as well as the growth of some tumors in response to estradiol stimulation. In a previous study the selective ER modulator raloxifene was shown to induce apoptosis in an ERbeta-positive bladder cancer cell line. However, the expression of ERbeta in human bladder cancer has not been thoroughly investigated.
ERalpha and ERbeta expression in 224 bladder tumor samples was evaluated using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. Levels of ERalpha and ERbeta protein and mRNA expression were determined in several bladder cancer cell lines using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. The effect of estradiol and antiestrogen treatments on RT4 bladder cancer cell growth was determined by cell proliferation assays.
Analyses revealed that only 2 human bladder cancers weakly expressed ERalpha. In contrast, the expression of ERbeta was detected in 141 tumors (63%). ERbeta was expressed in 58% of WHO Grade 1 and 2 tumors, whereas 70% of Grade 3 tumors demonstrated expression (P = .085). Importantly, although only 53% and 55% of Ta and T1 tumors demonstrated ERbeta expression, 80% of T2, 81% of T3, and 75% of T4 tumors showed ERbeta expression. The differences in ERbeta expression between Ta/T1 and T2/T3/T4 tumors were found to be highly significant (P < .001). Metastatic transitional cell carcinomas had ERbeta expression (80%) comparable to that of muscle invasive bladder cancers. Western blot analysis detected ERbeta protein expression in each of the 5 bladder cancer cell lines tested, whereas no or very low levels of ERalpha were found. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that higher levels of ERbeta than ERalpha mRNA were present in 5637, T-24, TSU-Pr1, and TCC-Sup bladder cancer cells, whereas ER-alpha mRNA levels were greater than ERbeta in RT4 cells. Treatment with 17beta-estradiol modestly increased RT4 cell growth, whereas the antiestrogens, 4-hydroxtamoxifen, raloxifene, or ICI 182,780 inhibited the growth of RT4 cells.
ERbeta is the dominant receptor expressed in bladder cancer cell lines and in the majority of human bladder tumors. Moreover, the degree of ERbeta expression increases with increasing stage and grade of differentiation. Antiestrogens have an inhibitory effect on the growth of bladder cancer cells in vitro.
Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder affecting more males than females. Heritability estimates for autism can rise above 90%, and genes influencing the serotonin system are strong candidates for autism susceptibility genes, as drugs selectively acting on the serotonin system are some of the most effective treatments for maladaptive behaviors seen in autism. ITGB3 was recently identified as a male quantitative trait locus (QTL) for whole-blood serotonin levels in the Hutterites (P = 0.0003). Here, we demonstrate associations between variation in ITGB3 and serotonin levels in two outbred samples (P = 0.010 and 0.015). Lastly, we show that a coding variant of ITGB3 is associated with autism susceptibility in a large multiplex sample (P = 0.00082), and that this variation has different effects in males and females (P = 0.0018).
Research with dopamine D(1) receptor antagonists or neuronal inactivating agents suggests that there is dissociable regulation of cocaine-seeking behavior by the rostral and caudal basolateral amygdala. In the present study, discrete infusions of the D(1) receptor agonist SKF 81297 (0.0-0.8 microg per side) were compared with those of the D(1) receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.0-2.0 microg per side) to demonstrate directly the importance of D(1) receptor mechanisms within the rostral and caudal basolateral amygdala for their functional heterogeneity in regulating cocaine-seeking behavior. Under a second-order schedule, cocaine-seeking behavior was studied during maintenance (cocaine and cocaine cues present) and reinstatement (only cocaine cues present). Food-maintained responding was used to examine the specificity of maximal behaviorally effective doses of SKF 81297 and SCH 23390. The results demonstrated that the D(1) agonist (0.4 or 0.8 microg) increased and the D(1) antagonist (1.0 microg) decreased cocaine-seeking behavior during maintenance when infused into the caudal but not the rostral basolateral amygdala. Cocaine intake was not affected by the agonist, and was decreased by the antagonist. During reinstatement, the D(1) agonist (0.4 microg) increased and the D(1) antagonist (1.0 microg) decreased cocaine-seeking behavior when infused into the rostral but not the caudal basolateral amygdala. In tests for behavioral specificity, the above effective doses of SKF 81297 and SCH 23390 used in self-administration experiments did not alter food-maintained responding. However, the 2.0-microg dose of SCH 23390 suppressed drug-maintained and food-maintained responding after infusion into both subregions. Collectively, these findings indicate dissociable sensitivity to D(1) receptor ligands within the caudal and rostral basolateral amygdala for altering cocaine-seeking behavior under different conditions that model phases of addiction.
