A 28-year-old male was diagnosed as aplastic anemia in 1983. He maintained on corticosterone with a large transfusion requirement for being resistant to other therapies, and combined with hemochromatosis at 20-year-old. In February 1994, he was admitted to the hospital for consideration of BMT. Echocardiogram was normal on admission. He was transplanted with bone marrow from his HLA-matched MLC negative sister following contained of TLI (7.5 Gy) and CY 50 mg/kg for four days on March 10 1994. Disturbance of consciousness appeared, an echocardiogram showed severe pericardial effusion on day 1 after BMT. He was diagnosed cardiac tamponade, pericardiocentesis was done immediately and 100 ml pericardial effusion was removed. Transiently he became alert, however, irreversible cardiac arrest occurred on day 2. Postmortem examination revealed thickened left ventricles with intramyocardial hemorrhage. It seems necessary to reduce CY, or substitute it with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or TBI etc. for BMT in aplastic anemia accompanied by hemochromatosis.
Plaque-type psoriasis has been successfully treated with oral calcitriol, but there has been no long-term follow-up on the safety and efficacy of this calciotropic hormone for psoriasis. In a single centre study, patients were enrolled in an open trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral calcitriol for psoriasis. Of the 85 patients who received oral calcitriol, 88.0% had some improvement in their disease; 26.5, 36.2 and 25.3%, had complete, moderate and slight improvement in their disease, respectively. The mean baseline psoriasis area severity index score (PASI) of 18.4 +/- 1.0 was reduced to 9.7 +/- 0.8 and 7.8 +/- 1.3 after 6 and 24 months on oral calcitriol therapy. Serum calcium concentrations and 24 h urinary calcium excretion increased by 3.9% and 148.2%, respectively, but were not outside the normal range. Bone mineral density remained unchanged. The clearance of creatinine decreased by 13.4% from baseline during the first 6 months of treatment, and thereafter, remained unchanged after 3 years of follow up. An evaluation of creatinine, inulin and paraaminohypurate (PAH) clearance was performed in eight patients. After 6 months on oral calcitriol, there was a 22.5% decline in creatinine clearance but no significant changes were observed in either inulin or PAH clearance, suggesting that calcitriol alters creatinine metabolism or secretion but does not affect renal function. Oral calcitriol is effective and safe for the treatment of psoriasis.
In a retrospective study of 82 patients with biliary carcinoma a higher than expected prevalence of methyldopa therapy was found. Carcinogenesis by electrophile reactive metabolites of methyldopa is discussed.
Within the scope of the Rat Liver Foci Bioassay the model carcinogens N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM), 2-acetylaminoflouren (2-AAF), phenobarbital (PB), and clofibrate (CF) were analyzed concerning their potency and dose-response relationship to induce foci of altered hepatocytes (FAHs), which are known to be precursor lesions of liver adenoma and carcinoma. The medium-term experiment follows an initiation-promotion protocol using diethylnitrosamine (DEN) as initiator. The present report deals with the application of two biologically based models for hepatocarcinogenesis, the two-stage clonal expansion model (TSCEM), and a color-shift model with beta distributed growth rates (CSMbeta). Both models yield similar conclusions concerning the mode of action of the carcinogens. However, the fit of CSMbeta appears closer to the observations than the fit of TSCEM. The analysis shows that application of a single dose of DEN has a persistent effect on the rate of FAH induction, especially in female rats. Overall, striking differences in the effect of the carcinogens were observed between male and female animals. 2-AAF shows a strong promoting effect in males, whereas in females the initiating effect dominates. NNM has both initiating and promoting effect, but in females, the rate of FAH formation seems to reach saturation at high dose. In the doses applied in the present experiment, PB has the weakest carcinogenic effect. Although PB alone does not induce FAH during the observation period, it increases the rate of FAH formation when applied following initiation with DEN. CF reduces the number and area fraction of GSTP-stained FAH, probably because it suppresses the placental form of glutathione S-transferase-positive phenotype.
A multi-age rat model was used to identify potential age-related differences in renal injury following exposure to gentamicin (GM). In this study, 10-, 25-, 40-, and 80-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed with GM at 0, 50, or 100 mg kg(-1) body weight per day (mkd) sc for 6 or 14 days. Urine samples were collected up to 72 h after initial dosing. The maximum tolerated dose was lower in 10-day-old rats than for other ages (none survived 11 days of treatment). Eighty-day-old rats given the highest dose showed a diminished rate of growth and an increase in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1), and renal pathology. Ten- and 40-day-old rats given 100 mkd of GM for 6- or 14 days also had increased levels of serum BUN and Cr and renal pathology, whereas only mild renal alterations were found in 25-day-old rats. After 6 days of treatment with 100 mkd GM, significant increases in Havcr-1 (Kim-1) gene expression were detected only in 10- and 80-day-old rats. In urine samples, nuclear magnetic resonance and ultra performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis detected changes related to GM efficacy (e.g., hippurate) and increases in metabolites related to antioxidant activity, which was greatest in the 80-day-old rats. The magnitude of the genomic, metabonomic, and serum chemistry changes appeared to correlate with the degree of nephropathy. These findings indicate that an experimental animal model that includes several developmental stages can detect age-related differences in drug-induced organ toxicities and may be a useful predictor of pediatric drug safety in preclinical studies.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) reportedly exerts beneficial effects on the heart following myocardial infarction and during nonischemic cardiomyopathy, but the precise mechanisms underlying the latter have not been well elucidated. We generated nonischemic cardiomyopathy in mice by injecting them with doxorubicin (15 mg/kg ip). Two weeks later, when cardiac dysfunction was apparent, an adenoviral vector encoding human HGF gene (Ad.CAG-HGF, 1x10(11) particles/mouse) was injected into the hindlimb muscles; LacZ gene served as the control. Left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction normally seen 4 wk after doxorubicin administration were significantly mitigated in HGF-treated mice, as were the associated cardiomyocyte atrophy/degeneration and myocardial fibrosis. Myocardial expression of GATA-4 and a sarcomeric protein, myosin heavy chain, was downregulated by doxorubicin, but the expression of both was restored by HGF treatment. The protective effect of HGF against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte atrophy was confirmed in an in vitro experiment, which also showed that neither cardiomyocyte apoptosis nor proliferation plays significant roles in the present model. Upregulation of c-Met/HGF receptor was noted in HGF-treated hearts. Among the mediators downstream of c-Met, the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was reduced by doxorubicin, but the activity was restored by HGF. Levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 and cyclooxygenase-2 did not differ between the groups. Our findings suggest the HGF gene delivery exerts therapeutic antiatrophic/degenerative and antifibrotic effects on myocardium in cases of established cardiac dysfunction caused by doxorubicin. These beneficial effects appear to be related to HGF-induced ERK activation and upregulation of c-Met, GATA-4, and sarcomeric proteins.
Diet and endocrine disrupting persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been associated with gynecologic conditions including uterine leiomyomata (UL), endometriosis, and ovarian cysts. Great Lakes sport fish consumption is a source of exposure to POPs such as p,p'-diphenyldichloroethene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This study was designed to examine retrospectively the effects Great Lakes sport fish consumption on the incidence of UL and to examine the effects of DDE and PCB serum levels on prevalent UL in women participating in the Great Lakes Fish Consumption Study. We hypothesized that associations of exposures with UL would be modified by breastfeeding status. Years of sport fish consumption, demographic, health, and reproductive data were assessed by survey. In a subgroup, serum was collected and tested for DDE and PCB levels. Effects of years of Great Lakes sport fish and sport fish consumption were modeled using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression and effects of POP exposures on UL were modeled using multiple logistic regression. Years of sport fish consumption were associated with UL, with an incidence rate ratio of 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.3) for each 10-year increment of fish consumption. Summary measures of POP exposures in the overall group were not associated with UL. In the subgroup of women who never breastfed and in whom PCB measurements were available, however, UL was significantly associated with PCBs and groupings of estrogenic, antiestrogenic, and dioxin-like PCBs. These findings support the possibility that PCB exposures from fish consumption may increase the risk of UL and highlight the importance of additional studies exploring biologic pathways by which they could be acting.
Little is known about the efficacy of H(2)-receptor antagonists in preventing recurrence of aspirin-related peptic ulcers. We compared the efficacy of high-dose famotidine with that of pantoprazole in preventing recurrent symptomatic ulcers/erosions.
We performed a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of 160 patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers/erosions, with or without a history of bleeding. Patients were given either famotidine (40 mg, morning and evening) or pantoprazole (20 mg in the morning and placebo in the evening). All patients continued to receive aspirin (80 mg daily). The primary end point was recurrent dyspeptic or bleeding ulcers/erosions within 48 weeks.
A total of 130 patients (81.1%) completed the study; 13 of 65 patients in the famotidine group reached the primary end point (20.0%; 95% one-sided confidence interval [CI] for the risk difference, 0.1184-1.0) compared with 0 of 65 patients in the pantoprazole group (P < .0001, 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.1184-1.0). Gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly more common in the famotidine group than the pantoprazole group (7.7% [5/65] vs 0% [0/65]; 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.0226-1.0; P = .0289), as was recurrent dyspepsia caused by ulcers/erosions (12.3% [8/65] vs 0% [0/65]; 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.0560-1.0; P = .0031). No patients had ulcer perforation or obstruction.
In patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers/erosions, high-dose famotidine therapy is inferior to pantoprazole in preventing recurrent dyspeptic or bleeding ulcers/erosions.
Indomethacin was given for the treatment of preterm labor in a twin pregnancy at a dosage of 200 mg/day for 7 days beginning at 34 weeks and 5 days' gestation. During treatment, one twin developed closure of the ductus arteriosus, tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, and pericardial effusion. Severe oligohydramnios in both amniotic sacs appeared as well. All findings resolved within 7 days of discontinuation of the medication. The infants, delivered vaginally at 37 weeks' gestation, were alive and well at a 2-month follow-up visit. We believe that all fetuses of mothers treated with indomethacin should be closely monitored for early evidence of decreased amniotic fluid volume and constriction of the ductus arteriosus.
The aim of this study was to specify the mechanism of hepatic encephalopathy which may occur in some cirrhotics treated by Spironolactone. In 31 cirrhotics with ascite, this diuretic induced a significant increase in arterial ammonemia; 8 patients developed an impending hepatic coma which was associated with ammonemia levels significantly higher than those observed in the patients without encephalopathy at the end of the treatment. Hyperammonemia induced by Spironolactone does not result from a muscular, renal or hepatic ammonia production but seems related to an increased intestinal ammoniagenesis which which is secondary to the bacterial hydrolysis of urea in the colon; indeed, there is a significant correlation between the ammonemia increase and the simultaneous rise in blood urea during treatment.
Percutaneous efficacy and tolerability of a new topical indomethacin spray compared with a corresponding placebo product were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study in 30 patients with tendinitis, i.e. 28 patients with peri-arthritis of the shoulder and two with epicondylitis. Each patient was treated with 4% indomethacin spray or the corresponding placebo product three to five times daily for a period of 14 days and then received the other treatment for the same period of time. The indomethacin spray demonstrated a clear efficacy compared with the placebo based on both objective criteria (elevation, abduction and internal rotation) and subjective criteria (spontaneous pain, pain on movement, pressure-induced pain, functional disturbances and sleep disturbances). Tolerability was excellent: only two patients had minor local cutaneous irritation with the indomethacin spray, which did not require interruption of treatment. Treatment with indomethacin spray appeared to be effective in 80% and well-tolerated in 93% of the patients studied.
Ethylene oxide (EO) is a genotoxicant and a mouse lung carcinogen, but whether EO is carcinogenic through a mutagenic mode of action remains unclear. To investigate this question, 8-week-old male Big Blue B6C3F₁ mice (10 mice/group) were exposed to EO by inhalation-6 h/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks (0, 10, 50, 100, or 200 ppm EO) and 8 or 12 weeks (0, 100, or 200 ppm EO). Lung DNA samples were analyzed for levels of 3 K-ras codon 12 mutations (GGT→GAT, GGT→GTT, and GGT→TGT) using ACB-PCR. No measureable level of K-ras codon 12 TGT mutation was detected (ie, all lung mutant fractions [MFs] ≤ 10⁻⁵). Four weeks of inhalation of 100 ppm EO caused a significant increase in K-ras codon 12 GGT→GTT MF relative to controls, whereas 50, 100, and 200 ppm EO caused significant increases in K-ras codon 12 GGT→GAT MF. In addition, significant inverse correlations were observed between K-ras codon 12 GGT→GTT MF and cII mutant frequency in the lungs of the same mice exposed to 50, 100, or 200 ppm EO for 4 weeks. Surprisingly, 8 weeks of exposure to 100 and 200 ppm EO caused significant decreases in K-ras MFs relative to controls. Thus, the changes in K-ras MF as a function of cumulative EO dose were nonmonotonic and were consistent with EO causing early amplification of preexisting K-ras mutations, rather than induction of K-ras mutation through genotoxicity at codon 12. The possibility that these changes reflect K-ras mutant cell selection under varying degrees of oxidative stress is discussed.
To evaluate the effects of prolonged treatment with losartan on endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent relaxations of aortic rings from adult and senescent spontaneously hypertensive rats, and to clarify whether these effects were due to specific mechanisms of the drug or a consequence of its blood-pressure-lowering action.
Adult (aged 5 months) and senescent (aged 20 months) male spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated for 12 consecutive weeks with 10 mg/kg per day losartan. Systolic blood pressure and plasma concentration of nitrates were evaluated. We studied endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent relaxations and response to angiotensin II of aortic rings from rats of each group. The direct effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonism on vascular reactivity of aortic rings from untreated adult and senescent rats that had been incubated beforehand with losartan were also studied.
Losartan treatment comparably reduced blood pressure and increased plasma concentration of nitrates in rats of both age groups. Responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were lower for rings from senescent than they were for rings from adult rats. Constrictor responses to angiotensin II were higher for rings from senescent than they were for rings from adult rats. Treatment with losartan increased the magnitude of relaxations in response to acetylcholine for rings from rats in both groups, but increased the magnitude of relaxations in response to nitroprusside only for rings from senescent spontaneously hypertensive rats. Incubation beforehand of aortic rings from untreated rats with losartan enhanced magnitude of relaxations in response both to acetylcholine and to nitroprusside only for rings from senescent spontaneously hypertensive rats.
The consequences of aging for endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent relaxations of rings from spontaneously hypertensive rats are ameliorated by losartan treatment, suggesting that angiotensin II plays a role via type 1 receptors. The effects of losartan on senescent spontaneously hypertensive rats were due not only to its blood-pressure-lowering action but also to the blockade of specific mechanisms derived from angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonism, which might involve an increase in availability of NO.
Appetite suppressants, including aminorex and fenfluramine, have been associated with pulmonary hypertension ever since the well-known outbreak of primary pulmonary hypertension in Europe after treatment with aminorex. The usage of a new anorectic agent, dexfenfluramine, has recently increased dramatically in developed countries. We report 2 new cases of lethal pulmonary hypertension associated with the use of dexfenfluramine.
The nucleus accumbens (Nac) is an important structure for cocaine-induced hyperactivity and receives a dense serotonergic (5-HT) innervation. Previous studies showed that a systemic activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors potentiates cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion, but attenuates the cocaine-induced 5-HT increase in the Nac. In order to address the role of Nac 5-HT(1A) receptors in the control of cocaine-induced and spontaneous behavioural activity and local 5-HT release, we used in vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats. The 5-HT(1A)-receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0, 1 and 10 microM), was applied locally into the Nac by reverse dialysis followed by a cocaine (10 mg/kg) or saline i.p. injection. The Nac 5-HT(1A)-receptor activation potentiated cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion, but attenuated rearing behaviour dose-dependently. Parallel to that, the cocaine-induced increase in Nac 5-HT dialysate level was unaffected, as were the decreases in 5-HIAA and DOPAC dialysate levels after cocaine. In saline treated rats, the local application of 8-OH-DPAT into the Nac affected neither spontaneous behavioural activity nor 5-HT, 5-HIAA or DOPAC dialysate levels in the Nac. These data suggest that Nac 5-HT(1A) receptors exert a bi-directional control of cocaine-induced hyperactivity, while not affecting spontaneous behaviour. Furthermore, accumbal 5-HT(1A) receptors do not appear to be directly involved in the acute effects of cocaine on 5-HT, 5-HIAA or DOPAC levels in the Nac.
Based on the concern of organochlorides in the environment and in human tissue, this study was designed to determine whether various noncytotoxic levels of heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide could inhibit, reversibly, gap junctional intercellular communication in human breast epithelial cells (HBEC). Cytotoxicity and gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) were evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase assay and fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching analysis, respectively. Both heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide were noncytotoxic up to 10 microg/ml. At this concentration, heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide inhibited GJIC of normal human breast epithelial cells after 1 h treatment. Within a 24 h treatment with heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide at 10 microg/ml, recovery of GJIC had not returned. GJIC completely recovered after a 12 h treatment of 1 microg/ml heptachlor epoxide, but it did not recover after a 24 h treatment of 1 microg/ml heptachlor. RT-PCR and Western blots were analyzed to determine whether the heptachlor or heptachlor epoxide might have altered the steady-state levels of gap junction mRNA and/or connexin protein levels or phosphorylation state. No significant difference in the level of connexin 43 (Cx43) message between control and heptachlor-treated cells was observed. Western blot analyses showed hypophosphorylation patterns in cells treated with 10 microg/ml heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide for 1 h with no recovery within 24 h. Immunostaining of Cx43 protein in normal HBEC indicated that heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide caused a loss of Cx43 from the cell membranes at noncytotoxic dose levels. Taken together, these results suggest that heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide can alter GJIC at the post-translational level, and that, under the conditions of exceeding a threshold concentration in the breast tissue containing 'initiated' cells for a long time and not being counteracted by anti-tumor-promoting chemicals, they could act as breast tumor promoters.
The protective effect of telmisartan, the angiotensin II-receptor antagonist, against liver toxicity induced by sodium arsenite (5 mg/kg/day, p.o., for 30 days) was investigated in mice. Telmisartan treatment (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) was applied for 30 days, starting on the same day of arsenic administration. Telmisartan significantly reduced serum alanine aminotransferase level which was increased by sodium arsenite. Telmisartan significantly suppressed lipid peroxidation, and prevented the reduced glutathione depletion and nitric oxide elevation in the liver tissue resulted from arsenic administration. Also, the increase of arsenic ion, and the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in liver tissue were attenuated by telmisartan. Histopathological examination showed that liver tissue injury mediated by arsenic was ameliorated by telmisartan treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that telmisartan significantly decreased the arsenic-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α, cyclooxygenase-2, nuclear factor-κB and caspase-3 in liver tissue. It was concluded that telmisartan may represent a potential option to protect the liver tissue from the detrimental effects of arsenic toxicity.
A prospective, randomized, and double-blind study comparing teicoplanin with vancomycin in the initial management of febrile neutropenic patients was conducted. Teicoplanin was administered at 6 mg per kg of body weight every 24 h (q24h) intravenously (i.v.) after initial loading at 6 mg/kg q12h for three doses. Vancomycin was administered at 15 mg/kg q12h i.v. Patients also received piperacillin (3 g q4h i.v.) and tobramycin (1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg q8h i.v.). Of 53 patients enrolled, 50 were judged to be evaluable. Among these, 25 received teicoplanin and 25 received vancomycin. At enrollment, both groups were comparable in age, sex, renal function, underlying hematologic condition, and concurrent therapy. Both groups had similar sites of infection and microbial pathogens. Empirical antimicrobial therapy resulted in the cure of or improvement in 23 (92%) teicoplanin patients and 21 (84%) vancomycin patients (P = 0.67). Failures occurred with two vancomycin patients but no teicoplanin patients. Clinical response was indeterminate for two patients in each group. Adverse reactions occurred significantly more often in the vancomycin group than in the teicoplanin group (P = 0.01), and these reactions required the termination of the study regimens of 6 vancomycin versus 0 teicoplanin patients (P = 0.02). Nephrotoxicity was observed more frequently in the vancomycin group (10 versus 2 patients; P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant deterioration of renal function when vancomycin and cyclosporin A, but not teicoplanin and cyclosporin A, were used concurrently (P = 0.02). Among patients who received vancomycin and amphotericin B or teicoplanin and amphotericin B concurrently, deterioration in renal function was equivalent in both groups. Teicoplanin in the dosage employed was tolerated better than vancomycin in the empirical treatment of fever and neutropenia in our patient population.
Capsaicin, a spicy component of hot peppers, has been shown to improve inflammatory disease and obesity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory activity of capsaicin can be used to improve free fatty acid (FFA)-induced inflammation by reducing gene expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) in THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell) macrophages. To investigate whether capsaicin ameliorates palmitate-induced MIP-1 and IL-8 gene expressions, we treated THP-1 cells with palmitate in the presence or absence of capsaicin and measured MIP-1 and IL-8 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. To elucidate the mechanism by which capsaicin effects on palmitate-induced MIP-1 and IL-8 gene expressions, we performed immunoblotting with stress kinase-related antibodies and measured palmitate oxidation and palmitate oxidation-related gene expression. Palmitate and stearate but not the unsaturated FFA oleate significantly increased MIP-1 and IL-8 expressions in THP-1 macrophages. Treatment with capsaicin or FFA oxidation stimulators inhibited palmitate-induced MIP-1 and IL-8 expressions in THP-1 macrophages. Capsaicin increased the gene expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and the β-oxidation of palmitate. Furthermore, capsaicin significantly reduced palmitate-stimulated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, c-Jun, and p38. Our data suggest that the attenuation of palmitate-induced MIP-1 and IL-8 gene expressions by capsaicin is associated with reduced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, c-Jun, and p38 and preserved β-oxidation activity.
A 59-year-old man treated with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin for advanced oesophageal cancer presented abnormal behaviour and subsequently developed impairment of cognitive function, dysphagia and dysarthria on the fifth day of the treatment. Although brain computed tomography revealed no abnormal findings, brain magnetic resonance imaging using diffusion-weighted imaging clearly revealed the presence of a high signal intensity in the deep white matter of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, including the corpus callosum symmetrically. A diagnosis of acute leukoencephalopathy was reached based on these findings. His clinical symptoms normalized four days after the discontinuation of the chemotherapy. Improvement in magnetic resonance imaging findings was delayed compared with that of clinical symptoms; however, the high signal intensity detected in the deep white matter had disappeared completely five months after the onset of symptoms. Early detection of drug-induced leukoencephalopathy is important as the clinical symptoms can be reversed by early discontinuation of the causative drug. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is a useful modality for the early detection and definitive diagnosis of this characteristic encephalopathy.
Administration of stobadine, a cardioprotective substance in investigation prevents a decrease in the content of protein SH groups and glutathione in hearts of rats treated with high doses of isoproterenol (ISO) (30 mg/kg). Moreover, stobadine also attenuated the increase in the content of malondialdehyde and activities of catalase and glutathione reductase as well as a diminution in the GSH/GSSG ratio observed in heart mitochondria isolated from ISO-treated animals. Since stobadine may be considered as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the above effects of the latter substance support the assumption about a possible involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in some processes initiated by administration of ISO in doses inducing cardiac hypertrophy. However our results also indicate that ROS-mediated processes are not necessarily involved in the mechanism of induction of cardiac hypertrophy itself.
A combination of an oral beta-adrenergic blocking agent and verapamil has been advocated as a safe treatment for angina. A case of Wenckebach type atrioventricular block occurring in a patient on metoprolol and verapamil is reported. It is suggested that this combination is used with caution.
Effect of latamoxef (LMOX) against tobramycin (TOB)-induced nephrotoxicity was studied in rats. Treatment with TOB (90 mg/kg/day, s.c.) alone resulted in marked increases in the activities of urinary enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and lysozyme, urinary protein content and blood urea nitrogen, which peaked on the 7th or 10th day. The combination with LMOX (500, 1000 or 2000 mg/kg/day, s.c.) significantly suppressed increases in the parameters with TOB alone. The extent of this suppression roughly depended on the LMOX dosage. Although TOB alone caused pronounced histological changes such as extensive cortical proximal tubular cell necrosis, residual tubular basement membrane and cast formations in the renal cortex and medulla on the 7th day, these changes were apparently suppressed by combination with LMOX. In addition, intrarenal TOB concentrations in the rat given TOB alone were about 350, 500 and 1000 micrograms/g tissue wet weight at 3 hr, on day 3 and on day 5, respectively. On the other hand, there was a significant reduction (30-60%) in intrarenal TOB concentration by combination with LMOX. These results indicate that combination with LMOX obviously protects the rat kidney from TOB nephrotoxicity, and the protective effect may be partially due to suppression of intrarenal accumulation of TOB by LMOX.
Maternal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been shown to be associated with an elevated risk for neural tube defects (NTDs). In the human body, PAHs are bioactivated and the resultant reactive epoxides can covalently bind to DNA to form PAH-DNA adducts, which may, in turn, cause transcription errors, changes in gene expression or altered patterns of apoptosis. During critical developmental phases, these changes can result in abnormal morphogenesis.
We aimed to examine the relationship between the levels of PAH-DNA adducts in cord blood and cord tissue and the risk of NTDs.
From 2010 to 2012, 60 NTD cases and 60 healthy controls were recruited from a population-based birth defects surveillance system in five counties of Shanxi Province in Northern China, where the emission of PAHs remains one of the highest in the country and PAHs exposure is highly prevalent. PAH-DNA adducts in cord blood of 15 NTD cases and 15 control infants, and in cord tissue of 60 NTD cases and 60 control infants were measured using the (32)P-postlabeling method.
PAH-DNA adduct levels in cord blood tend to be higher in the NTD group (28.5 per 10(8) nucleotides) compared with controls (19.7 per 10(8) nucleotides), although the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.377). PAH-DNA adducts in cord tissue were significantly higher in the NTD group (24.6 per 10(6) nucleotides) than in the control group (15.3 per 10(6) nucleotides), P=0.010. A positive dose-response relationship was found between levels of PAH-DNA adducts in cord tissue and the risk of NTDs (P=0.009). When the lowest tertile was used as the referent and potential confounding factors were adjusted for, a 1.03-fold (95% CI, 0.37-2.89) and 2.96-fold (95% CI, 1.16-7.58) increase in the risk of NTDs was observed for fetuses whose cord tissue PAH-DNA adduct levels were in the second and highest tertile, respectively.
High levels of PAH-DNA adducts in fetal tissues were associated with increased risks of NTDs.
The authors give an account of a 57-year-old male patient who was regularly dialyzed for two years and treated because of suspect TB of the spine with antituberculotics, incl. ethambutol. In the course of 8-9 months he was given 17.9 mg/kg ethambutol per day. Because of the practically zero excretion by the damaged kidney the drug cumulated in the serum and reached toxic levels before dialysis. Gradual deterioration of eyesight developed (central acuity and colour sense) which resulted in bilateral atrophy of the optic nerves with concentric narrowing of the visual field.
