TXN2 encodes human thioredoxin 2, a small redox protein important in cellular antioxidant defenses, as well as in the regulation of apoptosis. Txn2 knockout mice fail to complete neural tube closure by E10.5 and die in utero. We hypothesized that genetic variation in human TXN2 gene may alter the function of the encoded protein in a manner associated with an increased risk for neural tube defects (NTDs). A DNA re-sequencing effort of the human TXN2 gene was taken. After a variation in the promoter was identified, the transcriptional activity of different alleles was investigated. The possible association between these variations and the risk of spina bifida was further evaluated in a subset of samples obtained from a large population-based case-control study in California in two different ethnicity groups, non-Hispanic white and Hispanic white. We identified a novel promoter insertion polymorphism located 9 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site of exon 1(-9 insertion). The GA, G and GGGA insertions were associated with a marked decrease of transcriptional activity when overexpressed in both U2-OS (an osteosarcoma cell line) and 293 cells (derived from human embryonic kidney). Further analysis revealed that the GA insertion was associated with increased spina bifida risk for Hispanic whites. Our study revealed a novel Ins/Del polymorphism in the human TXN2 gene proximal promoter region that altered the transcriptional activity and is associated with spina bifida risk. This polymorphism may be a genetic modifier of spina bifida risk in this California population.
Sulfatases catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfate ester bonds from a wide variety of substrates and are implicated in several human inherited diseases. Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the simultaneous deficiency of all known sulfatases. MSD is caused by mutations in the Sulfatase Modifying Factor 1 (SUMF1) gene encoding the alpha-formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE), which is responsible for the post-translational modification of sulfatases. In all MSD patients, residual sulfatase activities are detectable, at variable levels. To correlate the nature of the residual sulfatase activities detected in MSD patients with residual FGE activity, four FGE mutants (i.e. p.S155P, p.R224W, p.R345C, p.R349W) found in homozygosis in MSD patients were analyzed. Using viral-mediated gene delivery, these mutants were over-expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from a recently developed Sumf1 KO mouse line which is completely devoid of all sulfatase activities. The results obtained indicate that mutant SUMF1 cDNAs encode stable SUMF1 proteins which are of the appropriate molecular weight and are properly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of these cDNAs in Sumf1-/- MEFs results in partial rescue of sulfatase activities. These data indicate that MSD is due to hypomorphic SUMF1 mutations and suggest that complete loss of SUMF1 function is likely to be lethal in humans.
Although it is known that prenatal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) can cause developmental adverse effects in mammals, the disruptive effects of this compound on hormonal systems are still controversial. Information concerning the effects of PFOS on hypothalamus adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress and corticosterone levels is not currently available. On the other hand, it is well established that stress can enhance the developmental toxicity of some chemicals. In the present study, we assessed the combined effects of maternal restraint stress and PFOS on HPA axis function in the offspring of mice. Twenty plug-positive female mice were divided in two groups. Animals were given by gavage 0 and 6 mg PFOS/kg/day on gestation days 12-18. One half of the animals in each group were also subjected to restraint stress (30 min/session, 3 sessions/day) during the same period. Five plug-positive females were also included as non-manipulated controls. At 3 months of age, activity in an open-field and the stress response were evaluated in male and female mice by exposing them to 30 min of restraint stress. Male and female offspring were subsequently sacrificed and blood samples were collected to measure changes in corticosterone levels at four different moments related to stress exposure conditions: before stress exposure, immediately after 30 min of stress exposure, and recuperation levels at 60 and 90 min after stress exposure. Results indicate corticosterone levels were lower in mice prenatally exposed to restraint. In general terms, PFOS exposure decreased corticosterone levels, although this effect was only significant in females. The recuperation pattern of corticosterone was mainly affected by prenatal stress. Interactive effects between PFOS and maternal stress were sex dependent. The current results suggest that prenatal PFOS exposure induced long-lasting effects in mice.
Hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1) is a rare disease caused by a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in the tyrosine catabolic pathway, resulting mainly in hepatic alterations due to accumulation of the toxic metabolites fumarylacetoacetate, maleylacetoacetate and succinylacetone. We have characterized using minigenes four splicing mutations affecting exonic or intronic nucleotides of the FAH gene identified in two HT1 patients. Two of the mutations are novel, c.82-1G>A and c.913G>C and the other two have been previously associated with a splicing defect (c.836A>G and c.1062+5G>A). All mutations were confirmed to affect splicing in minigenes, resulting in exon skipping or activation of a cryptic splice site. We have analyzed the effect of different compounds known to modulate splicing (valproic acid, phenyl butyrate, M344, EIPA, and resveratrol) and the overexpression of splice factors of the SR protein family on the transcriptional profile of the mutant minigenes. For the c.836A>G mutation, a partial recovery of the correctly spliced transcript was observed. These results confirm the relevance of performing functional studies for mutations potentially affecting the splicing process and open the possibility of supplementary therapeutic approaches to diseases caused by splicing defects.
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plays an important role in suppressing the growth of cancer. In this paper, the synergetic anticancer effect of combination DHA with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was investigated in gastric carcinoma cells. We found that DHA inhibited the growth of cultured SGC7901 cells at different concentrations in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the growth-inhibition activities of increasing concentration of 5-FU were markedly enhanced when different doses of 5-FU were administered in the combination with dose as low as 40 microg/ml of DHA. The early phase of apoptosis was increased in DHA- and 5-FU-treated cells. In the case of apoptotic genes expression in the combination-treated cells, BAX mRNA expression increased, whereas FAS, BCL-2, BCL2L12, and CASPASE-9 mRNA expression decreased. These results suggest that DHA strongly enhances the anticancer effect of 5-FU. Moreover, the application of both compounds on gastric cancer cells provides a new potential approach for cancer therapy.
Organochlorine insecticides such as DDT and chlordecone produce tremor in exposed individuals. Using a spectral analysis technique, chlordecone-induced tremor in rats was found to be dose- and time-related and could be distinguished from pharmacological agents (i.e., harmine, oxotremorine, and apomorphine) that produce tremor or stereotypic behavior. Drugs with known pharmacological effects were used to study the possible mechanism of chlordecone-induced tremor. Although no one neurotransmitter system appears necessary for tremor, the serotonergic, gabaergic, and cholinergic systems appear to contribute to chlordecone-induced tremor. The role of the catecholaminergic system is uncertain. Subsequent experiments indicated that supraspinal processes, possibly located in the brain stem, are important contributors to chlordecone-induced tremor. Activation of the cerebellum via the olivocerebellar tract to produce tremor cannot explain chlordecone's tremorgenic effects.
These experiments sought to establish a dose-effect relationship between the concentration of perchloroethylene (PCE) in brain tissue and concurrent changes in visual function. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was implemented to predict concentrations of PCE in the brains of adult Long-Evans rats following inhalation exposure. The model was evaluated for performance against tissue concentrations from exposed rats (n = 40) and data from the published scientific literature. Visual function was assessed using steady-state pattern-elicited visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded from rats during exposure to air or PCE in two experiments (total n = 84) with concentrations of PCE ranging from 250 to 4000 ppm. VEP waveforms were submitted to a spectral analysis in which the major response component, F2, occurring at twice the visual stimulation rate, was reduced in amplitude by PCE exposure. The F2 amplitudes were transformed to an effect-magnitude scale ranging from 0 (no effect) to 1 (maximum possible effect), and a logistical function was fit to the transformed values as a function of estimated concurrent brain PCE concentrations. The resultant function described a dose-response relationship between brain PCE concentration and changes in visual function with an ED(10) value of approximately 0.684 mg/l and an ED(50) value of approximately 46.5 mg/l. The results confirmed that visual function was disrupted by acute exposure to PCE, and the PBPK model and logistic model together could be used to make quantitative estimates of the magnitude of deficit to be expected for any given inhalation exposure scenario.
A 14-year-old boy presented with ongoing constipation as a manifestation of newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD) and a concomitant decline in renal function with biopsy-proven interstitial nephritis. Initiation of steroid therapy and mesalazine was associated with an improvement in symptoms and renal function. We describe a rare case of a 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)-naïve patient who developed interstitial nephritis in association with CD with no evidence of other primary glomerulopathy. A unique feature of the case being a profound systemic inflammatory response at the time of diagnosis and a relapse in nephritis 2 months after cessation of mesalazine in the absence of any macroscopic colitis.
The des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) level was found to be increased in the majority of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). This increase has to be distinguished from an increased DCP level linked to a vitamin K deficiency. We studied the evolution of increased DCP level in 6 patients with histologically proven HCC and in 10 without HCC after slow injection of 20 mg of vitamin K1. The DCP assays performed subsequent to the vitamin K1 injection showed: first, a durable normalisation of the DCP level in the patients without HCC, suggesting that the increased DCP was linked, in them, to an underlying vitamin K deficiency; second, a transitory decrease followed by a return to the abnormal level in the patients with HCC. We can conclude that an increased DCP level which persists following vitamin K1 injection is specific for HCC. The minimal delay for the DCP assay after vitamin K1 injection seems to be 15 days.
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a disorder of apoptosis associated most often with heritable FAS mutations leading to lymphadenopathy, hypersplenism and chronic refractory autoimmune cytopenias. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was used to treat cytopenias in 13 ALPS patients aged 9 months to 17 years from a cohort of 118 children (aged < 18 years) and 82 adults. Twelve responded for a median follow-up of 49 weeks (range 38-240 weeks), defined by maintenance of adequate blood counts and reduction in dosage or cessation of other immunosuppressive agents. This preliminary experience suggests that MMF may spare steroid usage in patients with ALPS-associated cytopenias.
In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II pilot and clinical trial, 908 patients [326 (35.9%) in the pilot study and 582 (64.0%) in the randomized study] were treated with 150 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen (rt-PA) activator in combination with heparin and aspirin, and 3,016 patients [64 (2.1%) in the pilot study and 2,952 (97.9%) in the randomized study] were treated with 100 mg rt-PA in combination with heparin and aspirin. Adverse neurological events occurred in 23 patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (2.5%) [nine cerebral infarctions (1.0%), 12 intracerebral hemorrhages (1.3%), and two subdural hematomas (0.2%)] and in 33 patients treated with 100 mg rt-PA (1.1%) [20 cerebral infarctions (0.7%), 11 intracerebral hemorrhages (0.4%), and two subdural hematomas (0.1%)]. The difference in adverse neurological events observed comparing the two rt-PA regimens was primarily due to a higher frequency of intracerebral bleeding among patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (1.3% versus 0.4%, p less than 0.01). Patients with recent (within 6 months) histories of stroke were not eligible for the study, and patients with any history of cerebrovascular disease were declared ineligible early in the study. The small number of patients (89, or 2.3%) with any history of neurological disease, intermittent cerebral ischemic attacks, or stroke who were enrolled before the stricter eligibility criteria were imposed or on the basis of incomplete baseline information experienced an increased frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage compared with patients without such histories (3.4% versus 0.5%). Mortality at 6 weeks after presentation among 23 patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage was 47.8%. Intracerebral hemorrhage is a severe but infrequent complication of rt-PA therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The combined frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and cerebral infarction after treatment with 100 mg rt-PA is comparable to that observed in other trials with thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial infarction.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors. We carried out a genome-wide association scan and replication study and found an association between SLE and a variant in TNFAIP3 (rs5029939, meta-analysis P = 2.89 x 10(-12), OR = 2.29). We also found evidence of two independent signals near TNFAIP3 associated with SLE, including one previously associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These results establish that variants near TNFAIP3 contribute to differential risk of SLE and RA.
The TNFAIP3 (tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3) gene encodes a ubiquitin editing enzyme, A20, that restricts NF-kappaB-dependent signaling and prevents inflammation. We show that three independent SNPs in the TNFAIP3 region (rs13192841, rs2230926 and rs6922466) are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) among individuals of European ancestry. These findings provide critical links between A20 and the etiology of SLE.
Gastric outlet obstruction is a common late result after acid ingestion; early complications, such as gastric necrosis or perforations are unusual. This is a report of a patient with the history of strong acid ingestion who underwent total gastrectomy due to perforation and extensive necrosis of the stomach.
To test the hypothesis that pain would be reduced after botulinum toxin type A (Btx/A) treatment for children with cerebral palsy (CP).
Thirty-four pediatric patients with CP (mean age 9 y; 56% male) and their parents were recruited through a regional specialty healthcare center medical clinic and pain research program. A 1-group pretest, posttest treatment design was used on the basis of a standardized parent-proxy report of their child's pain.
Overall parent ratings of their child's pain were significantly reduced after Btx/A injection with 62% of parents reporting the absence of pain 1 month after injection (proportion=0.38; 95% confidence interval=0.23-0.55). There were no significant differences for males or females.
Although there is considerable evidence that Btx/A is efficacious for the treatment of spasticity associated with CP, there is little direct evidence specific to associated analgesic effects after Btx/A treatment. These preliminary findings indicate that Btx/A treatment for spasticity resulted in significant pain reduction for this patient sample. This was the first study to directly ask parents about their child's pain pre-Btx/A and post-Btx/A treatment. These findings have implications for the management of pain associated with spasticity and CP and suggest further research is warranted.
Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and maintenance of sinus rhythm. We briefly describe two patients suffering from recent-onset atrial fibrillation, who experienced an acute devastating low back pain a few minutes after initiation of intravenous amiodarone loading. Notably, this side effect has not been ever reported in the medical literature. Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since prompt termination of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution.
To assess the efficacy of cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs) in osteoarthritis (OA) and their gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renovascular, and hepatic side effects compared with traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen.
Bibliographic database searches for randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and literature reviews.
Coxibs are comparable to traditional NSAIDs, providing moderate benefit for OA patients in pain and function versus placebo. NSAIDs, including coxibs, are superior to acetaminophen for OA, particularly in patients with moderate to severe pain. Coxibs decrease gastroduodenal ulcers (74% relative risk reduction) and ulcer complications (61% reduction) versus traditional NSAIDs. Meta-analysis of randomized trials indicates that coxibs increase the risk of myocardial infarctions approximately twofold versus placebo and versus naproxen, but do not increase the risk versus nonnaproxen NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including coxibs, commonly cause fluid retention and increase blood pressure and uncommonly induce congestive heart failure or significant renal dysfunction; risk factors include advanced age, hypertension, and heart or kidney disease. NSAIDs are a rare cause of clinical hepatotoxicity (<1 liver-related death per 100,000 NSAID users in clinical studies). Increased rates of aminotransferase elevations occur with rofecoxib (2%) and high-dose lumiracoxib (3%), and postmarketing cases of clinical liver injury with lumiracoxib have been reported recently.
Coxibs are as effective as traditional NSAIDs and superior to acetaminophen for the treatment of OA. Coxibs cause fewer gastrointestinal complications than traditional NSAIDs. Coxibs increase cardiovascular risk versus placebo and naproxen-but probably not versus nonnaproxen NSAIDs. Blood pressure commonly increases after initiation of selective or nonselective NSAIDs, especially in hypertensive patients.
The anti-HIV-1 activity of mangiferin was evaluated. Mangiferin can inhibit HIV-1(Ⅲ)(B) induced syncytium formation at non-cytotoxic concentrations, with a 50% effective concentration (EC₅₀) at 16.90 μM and a therapeutic index (TI) above 140. Mangiferin also showed good activities in other laboratory-derived strains, clinically isolated strains and resistant HIV-1 strains. Mechanism studies revealed that mangiferin might inhibit the HIV-1 protease, but is still effective against HIV peptidic protease inhibitor resistant strains. A combination of docking and pharmacophore methods clarified possible binding modes of mangiferin in the HIV-1 protease. The pharmacophore model of mangiferin consists of two hydrogen bond donors and two hydrogen bond acceptors. Compared to pharmacophore features found in commercially available drugs, three pharmacophoric elements matched well and one novel pharmacophore element was observed. Moreover, molecular docking analysis demonstrated that the pharmacophoric elements play important roles in binding HIV-1 protease. Mangiferin is a novel nonpeptidic protease inhibitor with an original structure that represents an effective drug development strategy for combating drug resistance.
We evaluated the radiographic characteristics as well as the clinical management of urolithiasis induced by systemic therapy with indinavir sulfate, a protease inhibitor utilized in the treatment of HIV infection.
Fifteen consecutive HIV-positive male patients (average age 41.3 years) who presented with urolithiasis while being treated with indinavir sulfate (average time 11.1 months) were studied.
All patients presented with flank pain, and eight had gross hematuria. All but one patient had microscopic hematuria. The location of the stones was the kidney in three, the proximal ureter in four, and the distal ureter in nine. One patient had both a renal and a proximal ureteral stone. The stones were radiolucent on CT imaging in five patients and could not be seen in five. In the five cases in which a stone was not definitely identified, a diagnosis of urolithiasis was established on the basis of ureteral obstruction and periureteral/renal streaking noted on CT. Treatment included observation with hydration in eight patients, ureteral stent placement in two patients, ureteroscopy in three patients, and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy in two patients. Stones were analyzed in five patients and proved to be 100% indinavir in three and a mixture of indinavir, calcium oxalate monohydrate, and calcium oxalate dihydrate in two.
Urolithiasis is a recognized complication of treatment with indinavir sulfate. Pure indinavir stones cannot be seen on CT unless intravenous contrast medium is utilized. Mixed calcium and indinavir stones can occur and may be radiopaque. The majority of HIV-positive patients with symptomatic urolithiasis can be treated conservatively with hydration. Metabolic evaluation of these patients with identification and correction of factors predisposing to stone formation may minimize future recurrences. Administration of this effective medication thus can continue uninterrupted.
A case of cholestatic jaundice after cloxacillin treatment is presented. Hepatotoxicity due to the drug was confirmed by inadvertent rechallenge and strongly positive tests for macrophage migration inhibitory factor and mast cell degranulation. The recognition of cholestatic hepatotoxicity due to oxacillin derivatives should help to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures in the evaluation of this reversible condition.
While altered activities in sensory neurons were noticed in neuropathic pain, caused by highly diverse insults to the peripheral nervous system, such as diabetes, alcohol ingestion, cancer chemotherapy and drugs used to treat AIDS, other infections and autoimmune diseases, as well as trauma, our understanding of how these various peripheral neuropathies manifest as altered neuronal activity is still rudimentary. The recent development of models of several of those neuropathies has, however, now made it possible to address their impact on primary afferent nociceptor function. We compared changes in mechanically-evoked C-fiber activity, in models of painful peripheral neuropathy induced by drinking ethanol (alcohol) or administering 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for AIDS therapy, two co-morbid conditions in which pain is thought to be mediated by different second messenger signaling pathways. In C-fiber afferents, ddC decreased conduction velocity. In contrast, alcohol but not ddC caused enhanced response to mechanical stimulation (i.e., decrease in threshold and increase in response to sustained threshold and supra-threshold stimulation) and changes in pattern of evoked activity (interspike interval and action potential variability analyses). These marked differences in primary afferent nociceptor function, in two different forms of neuropathy that produce mechanical hyperalgesia of similar magnitude, suggest that optimal treatment of neuropathic pain may differ depending on the nature of the causative insult to the peripheral nervous system, and emphasize the value of studying co-morbid conditions that produce painful peripheral neuropathy by different mechanisms.
CASK is a multi-domain scaffolding protein that interacts with the transcription factor TBR1 and regulates expression of genes involved in cortical development such as RELN. Here we describe a previously unreported X-linked brain malformation syndrome caused by mutations of CASK. All five affected individuals with CASK mutations had congenital or postnatal microcephaly, disproportionate brainstem and cerebellar hypoplasia, and severe mental retardation.
The goal of this study was to examine provider prescribing habits following carbamazepine discontinuation and to assess for the presence of antipsychotic-related adverse drug reactions due to the loss of car-bamazepine-related induction of the cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) 3A4 and p-glycoprotein.
A retrospective chart review of patient records from January 2006 through December 2007 at the Veterans Affairs (VA) San Diego Healthcare System was done, which focused on the co-prescription of carbamazepine and a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic (aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone) that is significantly affected by CYP3A4/p-glycoprotein induction. The cases in which carbamazepine was discontinued while the antipsychotic was continued during the 2-year time frame were then analyzed further. Data were collected concerning documentation of antipsychotic-related adverse drug reactions that occurred after carbamazepine was discontinued and prescribers' responses to carbamazepine discontinuation.
Nine patients were identified who had concomitant prescriptions for carbamazepine and a second-generation antipsychotic and who then discontinued carbamazepine. In only one case did the provider initially decrease the dose of the antipsychotic when carbamazepine was discontinued. Two patients experienced akathisia 3 weeks after carbamazepine was discontinued.
Many providers are not adjusting the dose of second-generation antipsychotics after discontinuation of a CYP3A4/p-glycoprotein inducer, placing patients at risk for adverse drug reactions. In addition to provider education, mechanisms need to be integrated into the current prescription processing software to alert providers of kinetic changes related to medication discontinuation. In addition, when discontinuing carbamazepine in patients who are being concomitantly treated with a second-generation antipsychotic that is a CYP3A4/p-glycoprotein substrate, providers should arrange for patient follow-up 2-4 weeks after carbamazepine discontinuation to evaluate patients for antipsychotic-related adverse drug reactions.
Two weeks following a renal arteriogram a 56-year-old man with severe hypertension developed a staphylococcal septicaemia. After six weeks treatment with intravenous fusidic acid and cloxacillin he became icteric, confused and disorientated. The fusidic acid was stopped and the serum bilirubin fell to normal. His confusion persisted and serum cloxacillin levels were found to be grossly elevated. The patient's mental state returned to normal following withdrawal of cloxacillin. We attribute his jaundice to treatment with fusidic acid and his acute confusional state to cloxacillin neurotoxicity.
In order to compare the efficacy and long-term tolerability of flecainide acetate versus quinidine, 239 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were prospectively treated with flecainide (n = 122) or quinidine (n = 117) in an open-label, randomized trial. All patients were followed for 1 year after initiation of therapy unless their antiarrhythmic drug was discontinued due to an inadequate therapeutic response or intolerable side effects. Although both drugs were equally effective in adequately controlling recurrences of atrial fibrillation (difference, p = 0.282; not significant), fewer flecainide patients had to have their therapy discontinued due to adverse experiences (p = 0.012). Based on both endpoints (efficacy and tolerability), an estimated 70.5% of flecainide versus 55.4% of quinidine patients would remain effectively treated at the end of 1 year on therapy (p < or = 0.007). The findings of this prospective study suggest that in the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (1) flecainide and quinidine are equally effective in the acceptable suppression of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; (2) flecainide is better tolerated than quinidine and is less likely to be discontinued due to adverse effects; and (3) given the overall endpoint of efficacy and tolerability, more patients are likely to continue long-term therapy with flecainide than with quinidine.
In the isolated frog sciatic nerve preparation, IC50 concentrations for nerve block were 0.34 +/- 0.9 mM for lidocaine (LIDO), 0.62 +/- 0.11 mM for procaine, 11.9 +/- 6.1 mM for disopyramide (DIP), and 52.8 +/- 24 mM for MIP (the mono-demethylated metabolite of DIP). In contrast to the LIDO block, DIP-induced nerve block was irreversible. DIP-induced depression of the electrically stimulated rat ventricular strip was completely reversed by washing the drug-free Tyrode's solution. In mice receiving 250 mg/kg DIP, neither convulsions nor death could be prevented by diazepam or other anticonvulsants. These results suggest that DIP has a very weak local anesthetic action which does not contribute significantly to disopyramide toxicity.
To examine the efficacy of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine sulfate in the treatment of bulimia, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. In 50 women who completed the trial, phenelzine was significantly superior to placebo in the reduction of binge frequency (64% vs 5%), in the fraction of patients who had ceased bingeing at the end of the trial (35% vs 4%), and in several measures of psychological state. The superiority of phenelzine over placebo was not confined to a depressed subgroup of patients. Although no patient experienced a hypertensive crisis during the study, other side effects of phenelzine were problematic and limit the usefulness of phenelzine in this population.
A crucial cause of the decreased bioactivity of nitric oxide (NO) in cardiovascular diseases is the uncoupling of the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) caused by the oxidative stress-mediated deficiency of the NOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). The reversal of eNOS uncoupling might represent a novel therapeutic approach. The treatment of apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-KO) mice with resveratrol resulted in the up-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms (SOD1-SOD3), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), and catalase and the down-regulation of NADPH oxidases NOX2 and NOX4 in the hearts of ApoE-KO mice. This was associated with reductions in superoxide, 3-nitrotyrosine, and malondialdehyde levels. In parallel, the cardiac expression of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), the rate-limiting enzyme in BH(4) biosynthesis, was enhanced by resveratrol. This enhancement was accompanied by an elevation in BH(4) levels. Superoxide production from ApoE-KO mice hearts was reduced by the NOS inhibitor L-N(G)-nitro-arginine methyl ester, indicating eNOS uncoupling in this pathological model. Resveratrol treatment resulted in a reversal of eNOS uncoupling. Treatment of human endothelial cells with resveratrol led to an up-regulation of SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, GPx1, catalase, and GCH1. Some of these effects were preventable with sirtinol, an inhibitor of the protein deacetylase sirtuin 1. In summary, resveratrol decreased superoxide production and enhanced the inactivation of reactive oxygen species. The resulting reduction in BH(4) oxidation, together with the enhanced biosynthesis of BH(4) by GCH1, probably was responsible for the reversal of eNOS uncoupling. This novel mechanism (reversal of eNOS uncoupling) might contribute to the protective effects of resveratrol.
