Gomisin A is a component of the fruits of Schizandra chinesis which are widely used as a tonic in traditional Chinese medicine. In the present study, we assessed the effect of gomisin A on the learning and memory impairments induced by scopolamine. The cognition-enhancing effect of gomisin A was investigated using a passive avoidance test, the Y-maze test, and the Morris water maze test in mice. Drug-induced amnesia was induced by treating animals with scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Gomisin A (5 mg/kg, p.o.) administration significantly reversed scopolamine-induced cognitive impairments in mice by the passive avoidance test and the Y-maze test (P<0.05), and also improved escape latency in the Morris water maze test at 5 mg/kg (P<0.05). Moreover, in an in vitro study, gomisin A was found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 value; 15.5 microM). These results suggest that gomisin A may be a useful cognitive impairment treatment, and its beneficial effects are mediated, in part, via enhancing the cholinergic nervous system.
The effect of L-form S-methylmethionine sulfonium chloride (L-MMSC) was studied in 26 patients with hypercholesterolemia during the oral administration period for 8 weeks (daily dose 1500 mg). The oral administration of L-MMSC resulted in the statistically significant decrease of serum total cholesterol (9.7%, P less than 0.001), but not of serum triglycerides. In addition, the statistically significant increases in serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) and in the ratios of HDL-cholesterol/(total cholesterol) -- (HDL-cholesterol) and HDL-cholesterol/(total cholesterol) + (triglycerides) were observed by the administration of L-MMSC. The therapeutic effects in in-patients were more remarkable than those in outpatients.
Cough suppressant preparations containing mixtures of dextromethorphan or codeine with antihistamines, decongestants (sympathomimetic), expectorants and antipyretics with either sedative or anticholinergic activity have been associated with dystonic reactions in children. We report on a 3-year-old girl who presented with episodic stiffness and abnormal posturing with rigidity after arbitrary maternal administration of a mixture of methylcodeine and extract from Hedera plant.
Appetite-suppressant drug fenfluramine is implicated in primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) but the molecular pathways that mediate this effect are unknown. A mouse model incriminates the serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor but contrasts with other models where this receptor has been shown to mediate pulmonary arterial relaxation via nitric oxide production.
We analyzed the human 5-HT(2B) gene in 10 patients with appetite-suppressant drug-associated PPH.
A mutation causing premature truncation of the protein product was found in one patient. The mutation was not found in 80 control subjects and no 5-HT(2B) mutation was found in 18 PPH patients not associated with appetite-suppressants. Functional analysis of the transfected receptor expressed either transiently in COS cells or stably in CHO cells demonstrated that the mutated receptor fails to activate the second messenger inositol-phosphates cascade and subsequent intracellular calcium release, in spite of normal expression at the cell membrane. The mutated receptor had no constitutive activity, and produced no dominant negative effect on the wild-type receptor.
Loss of serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor function may predispose to fenfluramine-associated PPH in man.
Pulmonary edema was induced by an increase in the dose of ritodrine in a patient receiving the drug for 28 days because of preterm contractions. After initial therapy, the cardiologic evaluation revealed peripartum cardiomyopathy. This is the first report of ritodrine causing pulmonary edema by unmasking underlying asymptomatic cardiomyopathy. This may have been the cause of some of the previously reported cases of ritodrine-induced heart failure.
To characterize the clinical features of patients with acute cerebral infarction who sustained intracerebral hemorrhage related to heparin anticoagulation, we describe 10 patients and review reports of 16 cases. Cardiac-source embolism was identified in seven (70%) of the 10 patients and consisted of atrial fibrillation in six of the seven. The middle cerebral artery territory was affected in nine patients (90%), with moderate-sized or large infarcts by clinical and computed tomographic criteria. The interval between stroke onset and intracerebral hemorrhage was less than 72 hours in 80% of the patients. Intracerebral hemorrhage occurred less than or equal to 24 hours after the time heparin was started in 80% of the patients. The activated partial thromboplastin time closest to the time of intracerebral hemorrhage was greater than 2 x control in seven patients. Our findings in the 10 patients are similar to those of the 16 cases previously reported and suggest that heparin-related intracerebral hemorrhage occurs early after stroke onset, usually with moderate-sized or large infarcts, and with excessive anticoagulation in some patients.
This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to determine the efficacy of dexmedetomidine compared with lidocaine in reducing the pain of propofol and rocuronium injection pain.
One hundred and fifty patients, scheduled for elective surgery with general anaesthesia, were divided into five groups: saline (Group 1), dexmedetomidine 0.25 microg kg(-1) (Group 2), lidocaine 0.5 mg kg(-1) (Group 3), dexmedetomidine 0.25 microg kg(-1) plus lidocaine 0.25 mg kg(-1) (Group 4) or dexmedetomidine 0.25 microg kg(-1) plus lidocaine 0.5 mg kg(-1) (Group 5) were administered at a rate of 0.5 mL s(-1) after tourniquet application. The occlusion was released after 1 min and 5 mL of propofol was injected over 20 s. Pain was evaluated by use of a 10-point verbal analogue scale. Then, the rest of the induction dose of propofol, 3 mL of saline bolus and 0.6 mg kg(-1) of rocuronium, was injected. The response to injection of rocuronium was assessed with a four-point scale (0-3).
Groups 1 and 2 were found to have higher propofol injection pain scores than Groups 3, 4 and 5 (P < 0.05). When the study groups were compared according to the overall incidence of withdrawal movements due to rocuronium (1 response) in Groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, they were different (86.7%, 60%, 36.7%, 50% and 40%, respectively) (P < 0.05). Except Group 1, there was no significant difference between the groups according to incidence of withdrawal movement after rocuronium injection (P = 0.325).
Pretreatment with dexmedetomidine is not effective in reducing injection pain of propofol, but may attenuate the hand withdrawal associated to rocuronium, as lidocaine does.
In recent years the use of illicit drugs has increased among adolescents in Sweden. Prolonged use of illicit drugs causes different psychiatric symptoms, but usage of short duration has also been reported to induce similar symptoms. It is less known how these psychiatric symptoms caused by occasional intake of illicit drugs are managed. The present study examined to which extent students in senior high school (third grade) have experienced psychiatric symptoms due to intake of illicit drugs, and to which extent they sought support in their nearby environment or professional help for these problems. The result shows that out of 104 18-year old students, 25 percent had tested illicit drugs, with no significant gender difference. 38 percent of the users reported psychiatric symptoms. In most of these cases either amphetamine or ecstasy had been used. The most common negative feelings reported were worry/anxiety, low spiritedness/depression, and feelings of unreality. The majority had not sought help for their problems among friends or adults. No one sought professional help. The frequency of adolescents that have tried drugs is on a level with other national surveys. Therefore it is most likely that the results regarding students who had experienced drug related psychiatric symptoms, and how they handled this experience, are representative for other eighteen-year-olds as well. It is of great concern that schools, medical services and social services have the knowledge that one fourth of the adolescents are trying illicit drugs, and almost four out of ten experience drug related psychiatric symptoms but most of them do not seek support or treatment for these symptoms.
Sixty-four patients with proven ulcerative colitis who had been maintained on sulphasalazine as their sole form of treatment for a minimum period of one year were entered into a controlled trial of sulphasalazine versus dummy tablets for a period of six months. All the patients admitted were not only symptom-free but also showed no evidence of inflammation on sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy. A patient was judged to have relapsed when there was a recurrence of colitic symptoms accompanied by sigmoidoscopic and histological evidence of inflammation. The patients who received dummy tablets had more than four times the relapse rate of those receiving sulphasalazine. The results were similar in patients who had been on maintenance treatment with sulphasalazine for less than three years before entry into the trial and in those who had been on this treatment for more than three years. It is concluded that maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis with sulphasalazine should be continued indefinitely unless contraindicated by side effects.
Reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia in rats is an animal model of tardive dyskinesia that has been linked with free radical generation and oxidative stress. In the present study, reserpine (1 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was given to rats on days 1, 3 and 5 to induce orofacial dyskinesia, which is characterised by increased vacuous chewing and tongue protrusion. Sub-chronic treatment with Korean ginseng extract from day 1 to day 21 along with reserpine on days 1, 3 and 5 significantly and dose-dependently (100 and 200 mg kg(-1)) reduced reserpine-induced vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions. Reserpine-treated animals also showed poor retention of memory in the elevated plus maze paradigm. The sub-chronic Korean ginseng extract administration significantly reversed reserpine-induced retention deficits. Biochemical analysis revealed that repeated reserpine treatment significantly induced lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels in the brains of rats. Reserpine-treated rats also showed decreased levels of antioxidant defence enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase. Sub-chronic administration of Korean ginseng extract dose-dependently and significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and restored decreased GSH levels by repeated reserpine treatment. It also significantly reversed the reserpine-induced decrease in brain SOD and catalase levels in rats. The present study concludes that oxidative stress might play an important role in reserpine-induced abnormal oral movements, and Korean ginseng extract could be useful in the treatment of drug-induced dyskinesia and amnesia.
Androgen blockage, with either orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs combined with an antiandrogen drug, is the standard treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Flutamide is a non-steroidal antiandrogen drug that is frequently used for total androgen blockage. We report on a 54-yr-old man with metastatic prostate cancer who developed nonoliguric acute renal failure (ARF) during treatment with flutamide. Following discontinuation of flutamide therapy, his renal functions returned to normal limits within 4 wk. After a rechallenge with flutamide, serum levels of BUN and creatinine increased again. His renal function recovered completely after the cessation of the drug for the second time. This observation confirm that ARF may be clearly attributed to flutamide therapy. Although very rare, flutamide-induced ARF should be considered.
We report a case of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) in a patient with breast cancer following adjuvant tamoxifen. Cessation of tamoxifen resulted in a prompt decline in urinary porphyrins suggestive of a causative role. Tamoxifen is known to be hepatotoxic; however, its association with PCT is unclear. In this report, we discuss the porphyrinogenicity of tamoxifen and potential mechanisms.
Liver tumors from a previous National Toxicology Program study were examined using global gene expression and mutation analysis to define the mechanisms of carcinogenesis in mice exposed to oxazepam. Five hepatocellular adenomas and 5 hepatocellular carcinomas from male B6C3F1 mice exposed to 5000 ppm oxazepam and 6 histologically normal liver samples from control animals were examined. One of the major findings in the study was upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Genes that activate β-catenin, such as Sox4, were upregulated, whereas genes that inhibit Wnt signaling, such as APC and Crebbp, were downregulated. In addition, liver tumors from oxazepam-exposed mice displayed β-catenin mutations and increased protein expression of glutamine synthetase, a downstream target in the Wnt signaling pathway. Another important finding in this study was the altered expression of oxidative stress-related genes, specifically increased expression of cytochrome p450 genes, including Cyp1a2 and Cyp2b10, and decreased expression of genes that protect against oxidative stress, such as Sod2 and Cat. Increased oxidative stress was confirmed by measuring isoprostane expression using mass spectrometry. Furthermore, global gene expression identified altered expression of genes that are associated with epigenetic mechanisms of cancer. There was decreased expression of genes that are hypermethylated in human liver cancer, including tumor suppressors APC and Pten. Oxazepam-induced tumors also exhibited decreased expression of genes involved in DNA methylation (Crebbp, Dnmt3b) and histone modification (Sirt1). These data suggest that formation of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in oxazepam-exposed mice involves alteration of the Wnt signaling pathway, oxidative stress, and potential epigenetic alterations.
In accordance with international recommendations on the need to decrease doses of antihypertensive drugs, a low-dose (1.5 mg) sustained-release (SR) formulation of indapamide was developed to optimize the drug's efficacy : safety ratio. The aim of this work was to evaluate the benefit of a low-dose diuretic by consolidating the efficacy and safety results of two clinical trials with a similar design.
Clinical data were obtained in two European randomized double-blind studies with 690 mild to moderate hypertensive patients (95 mmHg < or = supine diastolic blood pressure < or = 114 mmHg using a mercury sphygmomanometer) treated respectively for 2 and 3 months, with a mean age of 53 and 57 years, 44 and 57% males, mean supine diastolic blood pressure of 100.6 and 102.5 mmHg and mean supine systolic blood pressure of 161.0 and 164.5 mmHg.
The first study, a dose-finding study with indapamide SR at 1.5, 2 and 2.5 mg versus placebo and the immediate-release (IR) formulation of indapamide, showed that the 1.5 mg dosage of the new indapamide formulation had an improved antihypertensive efficacy : safety ratio. The second study confirmed the equivalence of blood pressure reductions with 1.5 mg indapamide SR and 2.5 mg indapamide IR, and better acceptability with 1.5 mg indapamide SR, particularly in the number of patients with serum potassium levels < 3.4 mmol/l, which was reduced by more than 50%. The long-term efficacy of 1.5 mg indapamide SR was observed through a 9-month open-treatment follow-up to the second study.
The 1.5 mg SR formulation of indapamide has an improved antihypertensive efficacy : safety ratio, which is in accordance with international recommendations for the use of low-dose antihypertensive drugs and diuretics in first-line therapy of hypertension.
Investigation of abnormal skin response to niacin (vitamin B3) stimulation has gained increasing interest in schizophrenia research during last years. However, current efforts to implement niacin tests in routine diagnostics are jeopardised by wide inter-individual variations of skin response. We investigated age and gender as potential factors of influence on niacin sensitivity in 117 healthy subjects (63 male, 54 female). Niacin was applied in three dilution steps (0.1, 0.01, 0.001 M) onto the inner forearm skin. Skin reaction was assessed in three minute intervals over 15 min using optical reflection spectroscopy. Males displayed a significantly weaker flush response than females. The rate of non-responders at the lowest concentration was about twice as high in men than women. Significant negative correlations between age and niacin sensitivity were revealed for both sexes. Age and gender considerably influence niacin sensitivity, possibly due to the effects of sex hormones on vasomotor function and prostaglandin metabolism. Consideration of gender and age is strongly recommended for further clinical niacin studies.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (alpha, gamma, and delta/beta) are nuclear hormone receptors and ligand-activated transcription factors that serve as key determinants of myocardial fatty acid metabolism. Long-term cardiomyocyte-restricted PPARdelta deficiency in mice leads to depressed myocardial fatty acid oxidation, bioenergetics, and premature death with lipotoxic cardiomyopathy.
To explore the essential role of PPARdelta in the adult heart.
We investigated the consequences of inducible short-term PPARdelta knockout in the adult mouse heart. In addition to a substantial transcriptional downregulation of lipid metabolic proteins, short-term PPARdelta knockout in the adult mouse heart attenuated cardiac expression of both Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and manganese superoxide dismutase, leading to increased oxidative damage to the heart. Moreover, expression of key mitochondrial biogenesis determinants such as PPARgamma coactivator-1 were substantially decreased in the short-term PPARdelta deficient heart, concomitant with a decreased mitochondrial DNA copy number. Rates of palmitate and glucose oxidation were markedly depressed in cardiomyocytes of PPARdelta knockout hearts. Consequently, PPARdelta deficiency in the adult heart led to depressed cardiac performance and cardiac hypertrophy.
PPARdelta is an essential regulator of cardiac mitochondrial protection and biogenesis and PPARdelta activation can be a potential therapeutic target for cardiac disorders.
Although more than 100 mutations have been identified in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), the mechanism responsible for FALS remains unclear. The finding of the present study shows that FALS-causing mutant Cu/Zn-SOD proteins (FALS mutant SODs), but not wild-type SOD, are barely detected by three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Western blot analyses. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for denatured FALS mutant SODs by dithiothreitol, SDS, or heat treatment also showed a lowered immunoreactivity against the mAbs compared with wild-type SOD. Because all the epitopes of these mAbs are mapped within the Greek key loop (residues 102-115 in human Cu/Zn-SOD), these data suggest that different conformational changes occur in the loop between wild-type and FALS mutant SODs during the unfolding process. Circular dichroism measurements revealed that the FALS mutant SODs are sensitive to denaturation by dithiothreitol, SDS, or heat treatment, but these results do not completely explain the different recognition by the mAbs between wild-type and FALS mutant SODs under the denatured conditions. The study on the conformational changes in local areas monitoring with mAbs may provide a new insight into the etiology of FALS.
It is well known that the analgesic potency of morphine is reduced in neuropathic pain. In this study, we demonstrate that the decreased effectiveness of systemic morphine in neuropathic pain might be caused by the loss of morphine analgesia at the periphery. When given s.c. or i.t., the dose-response curves for morphine analgesia in Hargreaves thermal test were shifted rightward in partial sciatic nerve-injured mice compared with control sham-operated mice. The dose-response curves for i.c.v. morphine analgesia, however, were unchanged in nerve-injured mice, indicating no decrease in morphine potency at the supraspinal level. On the other hand, the dose-dependent analgesia produced by intraplantar (i.pl.) morphine in sham-operated mice almost completely disappeared in nerve-injured mice. With the more sensitive algogenic-induced nociceptive flexion test, significant reduction in the analgesic potency of systemic morphine was observed for bradykinin (BK) nociception in nerve-injured mice, and the analgesic effect of i.pl. morphine against BK nociception in sham-operated mice disappeared in nerve-injured mice. In immunohistochemical experiments, we found that, under normal state, mu-opioid receptors (MOPs) were mainly expressed in small-diameter unmyelinated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and colocalized with bradykinin B2 receptors. When we examined MOP expression in the DRG of nerve-injured mice, we observed a drastic decrease in MOP expression. Altogether, these data suggest that the lower potency of systemic morphine in neuropathic pain could be at least partly caused by the decreased MOP expression in DRG and subsequent loss of peripheral morphine analgesia in such a condition.
Two male patients with high-grade gliomas were treated with subtotal or total resection and radiotherapy followed by a lomustine-containing chemotherapy regimen. Both patients took lomustine at an oral dose of 800 mg over five days instead of their regular doses of 200 and 240 mg. Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in both patients within two weeks of the last lomustine dose. One of them was admitted to hospital because of febrile neutropenia. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were detected in the other patient when he was examined in the emergency room following a generalized convulsion. Both patients recovered from the severe myelosuppression caused by lomustine. No other organ toxicities were observed.
Intracranial hypertension with papilledema occurred in two patients receiving danazol therapy for either cyclic neutropenia or immune hemolytic anemia. Results of clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiologic studies showed no apparent cause for the condition in Case 1 and the papilledema resolved one month after discontinuing danazol. Carotid angiography in Case 2 demonstrated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; the papilledema showed gradual improvement after cessation of danazol. An additional seven cases of pseudotumor cerebri presumed secondary to danazol therapy have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration. The papilledema resolved in all seven cases soon after discontinuing danazol. A drug-induced complication should be suspected, and alternative therapy sought, in patients who develop intracranial hypertension associated with administration of danazol.
Pharmacological management of persistent aggression in patients with schizophrenia is a difficult clinical dilemma. Clozapine has been shown to be an effective agent in this regard. This study sought to compare the symptomatic response on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) between hostile schizophrenic patients and patients without aggression. While dramatic improvements were evident in aggression, both groups were indistinguishable with respect to BPRS response. These results suggest that clozapine may have a selective antiaggressive effect.
Oxydemeton-methyl, an organophosphate insecticide and acaricide produced decrease in the exploratory behaviour and prolongation of barbitone sodium induced hypnosis in rats after intermittent aerosol spray inhalational exposure, for 1/2 hour daily for 7 consecutive days, compared to the saline control group. Further, ED50 +/- SEM value for haloperidol induced catalepsy, CD50 +/- SEM value for pentylenetetrazole induced seizure and CI50 +/- SEM value for electroshock (i.e. the dose of haloperidol, PTZ and intensity of electroshock producing catalepsy or positive seizure response in 50% of rats) were significantly decreased after 7 days exposure to oxydemeton-methyl compared to that of saline control group. The study has established the central nervous system depressant effect, extrapyramidal effect and proconvulsant potential of oxydemeton-methyl which is widely used by the agricultural workers in the form of field spray.
In previous studies, we have found that expression of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) and its main product, 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, are decreased in human colorectal cancers and that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can therapeutically induce 15-LOX-1 expression to trigger apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells. NSAIDs similarly induce apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells, although the mechanisms of these effects remain to be defined. In the present study, we tested whether 15-LOX-1 is down-regulated in human esophageal cancers using paired normal and tumor human surgical samples and whether NSAIDs can up-regulate 15-LOX-1 to restore apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells. We found that: (a) 15-LOX-1 was down-regulated in human esophageal carcinomas; (b) NSAIDs induced 15-LOX-1 expression during apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells; and (c) 15-LOX-1 inhibition suppressed NSAID-induced apoptosis, which was restored by 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid but not by its parent compound, linoleic acid. These findings demonstrate that 15-LOX-1 is down-regulated in human esophageal carcinomas and that NSAIDs induce apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells via up-regulation of 15-LOX-1. They also support the concept that the loss of the proapoptotic role of 15-LOX-1 in epithelial cancers is not limited to human colorectal cancers.
Through the inhibition of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B), (-)-deprenyl (selegiline) prevents the conversion of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to the toxic metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) and also prevents the neurotoxicity in the dopaminergic neurons in animal models. Cumulative observations suggest that selegiline may also protect against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity, possibly through the induction of pro-survival genes. We have observed that thioredoxin (Trx) mediates the induction of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and Bcl-2 during preconditioning-induced hormesis. We therefore investigated whether the redox protein Trx plays any role in the neuroprotective mechanism of selegiline against MPP+-induced cytotoxicity in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and also in primary neuronal cultures of mouse midbrain dopaminergic neurons. After confirming that selegiline protects against MPP+-induced cytotoxicity, we observed further that selegiline, at 1 microM or less, induced Trx for protection against oxidative injury caused by MPP+. The induction of Trx was blocked by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor and mediated by a PKA-sensitive phospho-activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk1/2 and the transcription factor c-Myc. Selegiline-induced Trx and associated neuroprotection were concomitantly blocked by the antisense against Trx mRNA, but not the sense or antisense mutant phosphothionate oligonucleotides, not only in human SH-SY5Y cells but also in mouse primary neuronal culture of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, the redox cycling of Trx may mediate the protective action of selegiline because the inhibition of Trx reductase by 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene ameliorated the effect of selegiline. Trx (1 microM) consistently increased the expression of mitochondrial proteins MnSOD and Bcl-2, supporting cell survival (Andoh et al., 2002). In conclusion, without modifying MAO-B activity, selegiline augments the gene induction of Trx, leading to elevated expression of antioxidative MnSOD and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins for protecting against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity.
A retrospective analysis of the records of 22 type II diabetics whose treatment had been changed from insulin to chlorpropamide was performed to investigate the relative effects of insulin and chlorpropamide on blood pressure. Although diastolic BP index was not significantly different between the treatments, systolic BP index was significantly higher on chlorpropamide than on insulin (141 +/- 3 v 135 +/- 3 mm Hg, P = .02). In 10 patients in whom insulin was reinstituted, systolic BP fell significantly (P < .005), suggesting that in type II diabetics chlorpropamide exerts a relative hypertensive effect in comparison to insulin.
Anticardiolipin antibodies were determined in 96 psychiatric patients treated chronically with chlorpromazine by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-IgM and anti-IgG (fab'2 fragment) as the second antibody. Fifty-four of these patients had an IgM-lupus anticoagulant, and the remaining 42 were followed as controls. Elevated IgM-anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) levels were detected in 31 patients with the lupus anticoagulant and in 5 controls (p less than 0.001). During a median followup of 5 years, single episodes of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism occurred in three patients; one had the lupus anticoagulant and the other two had low-level ACA. Contrary to the reported experience in systemic lupus erythematosus and related autoimmune disorders, chlorpromazine-induced lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies levels appear not to be associated with an increased incidence of thrombosis.
To investigate the influence of iron deficiency and iron supplementation on nitric oxide (NO) production, we measured serum iron markers, serum nitrate and nitrite (NOx) concentrations, reticulocyte maturity index (RMI), and serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels in 369 females aged 14-19 years. RMI was analyzed by flow cytometry, sTfR concentrations were measured by enzyme immunoassay, and serum NOx levels were tested by the Griess reaction. NOx concentrations of the subjects in iron depletion phase were significantly higher than those of healthy controls. NOx concentrations increased gradually as iron deficiency progressed and were threefold higher than for the healthy controls, when the subjects attained a frank iron deficiency anemia. In particular, the NOx concentrations were 7.5-fold higher in the patients with severe iron deficiency anemia (Hb<80 g/l) than for the subjects with high hemoglobin value (Hb>or=140 g/l). The increased NOx concentrations (132.6+/-42.1 microM) observed in the group with severe anemia decreased significantly (46.3+/-15.8 microM) after hemoglobin levels were normalized by iron supplementation ( P<0.01). NOx concentrations correlated inversely with hemoglobin levels ( r(2)=0.202, P<0.01), but correlated positively with the sTfR concentrations ( r(2)=0.322, P<0.01) and the RMI ( r(2)=0.369, P<0.01). In conclusion, iron deficiency anemia increases NO production, and elevated NOx concentrations in iron deficiency anemia return to normal with iron supplementation.
Epidemiological and laboratory studies have suggested that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may be a risk factor for Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential mechanisms by which PCBs may disrupt normal functioning of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system. We utilized an environmentally relevant exposure of PCBs (7.5 or 15 mg/kg/day Aroclor 1,254:1,260 for 30 days by oral gavage) to identify early signs of damage to the DA system. This dosing regimen, which resulted in PCB levels similar to those found in human brain samples, did not cause overt degeneration to the DA system as shown by a lack of change in striatal DA levels or tyrosine hydroxylase levels. However, we did observe a dramatic dose-dependent decrease in striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) levels. The observed reductions appear to be specific to the DAT populations located in the striatum, as no change was observed in other dopaminergic brain regions or to other neurotransmitter transporters present in the striatum. These data demonstrate that PCB tissue concentrations similar to those found in postmortem human brain specifically disrupt DA transport, which acts as a precursor to subsequent damage to the DA system. Furthermore, DAT imaging may be useful in evaluating alterations in brain function in human populations exposed to PCBs.
