Carbamazepine is a first line drug in the treatment of epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia, but may exert negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects on the cardiac conduction system. Bradyarrhythmias of different types and severity have been described, especially in the elderly, but the prevalence of arrhythmias in a larger group of carbamazepine treated patients is unknown. Forty-eight patients, 40 years of older, on continuous carbamazepine treatment because of various neurologic disorders were investigated by interview, physical examination, 12-lead surface electrocardiogram, and 24-h long-term electrocardiogram recording. The prevalence of bradyarrhythmias was compared with that in an age-stratified reference group. There was no differences between the two groups, either in the number or the duration of pauses or in the type of pauses. In conclusion, carbamazepine does not increase the risk of bradyarrhythmias in the vast majority of patients.
Allopregnanolone (AlloP), GABA(A) positive modulator, has efficacy as anticonvulsant. In contrast, nicotine and pregnenolone sulfate (PregS) act as potent convulsants. The present study aims to evaluate whether a promnesic dose of PregS and/or an anxiolytic dose of AlloP administered in the hippocampus can affect the audiogenic seizures induced by nicotine administration. Rats were assigned at random to six groups that received two consecutive intrahippocampal (dorsal CA1) injections once a week during three consecutive weeks. First injection: nicotine (4.6 microg, 20 mM) or saline, second injection: PregS (5 ng, 24 microM), AlloP (0.2 microg, 1.26 microM) or saline. After the last injections, locomotor activity and audiogenic seizures were tested. AlloP decreased the horizontal and vertical activity, suggesting sedative effects. Nicotine induced behavioral convulsions and AlloP acted as an anticonvulsant. AlloP reversed the seizures induced by nicotine and decreased the audiogenic convulsions in comparison with the controls. PregS also reversed the nicotine-induced audiogenic seizures in the nicotine group but not in the control group. These results suggest that anticonvulsive effects of AlloP and PregS are mediated by different action mechanisms such as GABA(A) positive modulation, or negative modulatory action on neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Even though several brain structures could be involved, these results highlight the important role played by hippocampal cholinergic and GABAergic activities, as well as neurosteroids, especially AlloP, in preventing convulsive behavior.
The basal and benz(a)anthracene-induced aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities of C3H 10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts have been shown to vary with population growth. We report here that, in the case of dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, cytotoxicity and transformation (neoplastic/morphological transformation and focus formation) increased as a consequence of population growth and, at high cell densities, DNA adduct formation was elevated. Among the factors that may contribute to these changes, we have found that conditioning of the medium with population growth plays a significant role. Cells treated with medium conditioned by several days of cell growth supported increases in the dimethylbenz(a)anthracene induction of mRNA expression of a new mouse cytochrome P450 gene designated Cyp1b1, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity, cytotoxicity, and the frequency of neoplastic transformation. These results suggest a cause and effect relationship between the enhanced expression of Cyp1b1 due to medium conditioning and the enhanced expression of the cellular endpoints cytotoxicity and transformation.
Ifosfamide is widely used in paediatric oncology, but its use is limited by nephrotoxic side effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of tubulopathy, with special emphasis on the influence of age, where different findings have been published so far.
Five hundred ninety three children and adolescents treated for Ewing, osteo- or soft-tissue sarcoma (median age at diagnosis: 11.7 years) were prospectively investigated for nephrotoxicity in the Late Effects Surveillance System (LESS) study. Tubulopathy was diagnosed in case of continuing hypophosphatemia and proteinuria.
After a median follow up of 19 months, 27 patients (4.6%; 95% CI: 3.0-6.6%) had newly developed tubulopathy. This incidence was 0.4% (95% CI: 0-2.4%) in patients treated with a cumulative ifosfamide dose of < or =24 g/m2, 6.5% (95% CI: 3.6-10.7%) after 24-60 g/m2, and 8.0% (95% CI: 4.2-13.6%) after > or = 60 g/m2. In multivariate analysis, children younger than 4 years at time of diagnosis had an 8.7-fold (95% CI: 3.5-21.8) higher risk for tubulopathy than older patients. Neither carboplatin treatment nor abdominal irradiation showed any significant influence.
Ifosfamide-induced nephrotoxicity was found in 4.6% of patients. Risk factors were the cumulative ifosfamide dose and young age at treatment.
Protein kinase C (PKC) is able to phosphorylate several cellular components that serve as key regulatory components in signal transduction pathways of nociceptor excitation and sensitisation. Therefore, the present study attempted to assess some of the mechanisms involved in the overt nociception elicited by peripheral administration of the PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), in mice. The intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of PMA (16-1600 pmol/paw), but not its inactive analogue alpha-PMA, produced a long-lasting overt nociception (up to 45 min), as well as the activation of PKCalpha and PKCepsilon isoforms in treated paws. Indeed, the local administration of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X completely blocked PMA-induced nociception. The blockade of NK1, CGRP, NMDA, beta1-adrenergic, B2 or TRPV1 receptors with selective antagonists partially decreased PMA-induced nociception. Similarly, COX-1, COX-2, MEK or p38 MAP kinase inhibitors reduced the nociceptive effect produced by PMA. Notably, the nociceptive effect promoted by PMA was diminished in animals treated with an antagonist of IL-1beta receptor or with antibodies against TNFalpha, NGF or BDNF, but not against GDNF. Finally, mast cells as well as capsaicin-sensitive and sympathetic fibres, but not neutrophil influx, mediated the nociceptive effect produced by PMA. Collectively, the results of the present study have shown that PMA injection into the mouse paw results in PKC activation as well as a relatively delayed, but long-lasting, overt nociceptive behaviour in mice. Moreover, these results demonstrate that PKC activation exerts a critical role in modulating the excitability of sensory neurons.
Psychostimulant use disorder and schizophrenia have a substantial genetic basis. Evidence from human and animal studies on the involvement of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system in methamphetamine (METH) use disorder and schizophrenia is mounting. As we tested for the association of the human GABA(A) receptor gamma 2 subunit gene (GABRG2) with each diagnostic group, we used a case-control design with a set of 178 subjects with METH use disorder, 288 schizophrenics and 288 controls. First, we screened 96 controls and identified six SNPs in GABRG2, three of whom we newly reported. Next, we selected two SNPs, 315C>T and 1128+99C>A, as representatives of the linkage disequilibrium blocks for further case-control association analysis. Although no associations were found in either allelic or genotypic frequencies, we detected a haplotypic association in GABRG2 with METH use disorder, but not with schizophrenia. This finding partly replicates a recent case-control study of GABRG2 in METH use disorder, and thus indicates that GABRG2 may be one of the susceptibility genes of METH use disorder.
The purpose of this study is to clarify fetal cardiovascular effects of four popular analgesics administered to a maternal animal model. Clinical doses of aspirin (14 mg/kg), acetaminophen (14 mg/kg), ibuprofen (6 mg/kg), or indomethacin (0.7 mg/kg) were administered orally to near-term rats. At 1, 4, 8, or 24 hours later fetuses were delivered by cesarean section, and were fixed immediately by the whole-body freezing technique. The ductus diameter, pericardial effusion, and volume and mass of the ventricles were studied by photographing multiple planes of the heart. Fetal ductal constriction was most remarkable with ibuprofen, with the diameter decreased 70% +/- 5% (mean +/- SEM) at 1 to 8 hours. Both ventricles were dilated 60% +/- 27%, and pericardial fluid was increased 120% +/- 20%. These changes partly disappeared at 24 hours. Milder but more persistent effects were observed with indomethacin. The fetal ductus was constricted 30% at 4 to 24 hours. Pericardial fluid was increased 140% +/- 30% at 24 hours. Aspirin and acetaminophen constricted the fetal ductus 10%. In conclusion, clinical doses of ibuprofen and indomethacin constricted the fetal rat ductus and caused cardiac failure. The effects of aspirin and acetaminophen were much milder.
We report on a boy who had multiple synostosis syndrome 1, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive symphalangism, multiple joint fusions, conductive deafness, and mild facial dysmorphism. In addition the boy developed delay of puberty, bone age, and closure of the epiphyseal lines of long bones with tall stature. These findings and decreased plasma LH and FSH levels at age 19 years were compatible with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. G-banded chromosomes showed a balanced translocation t(10;17)(p15.3;q22). Chromosomal FISH analysis, using a series of BAC clones surrounding the translocation breakpoints, detected a 2.2-3.9 Mb deletion at 17q22. The deletion encompassed NOG, a gene responsible for multiple synostosis syndrome 1. It was assumed that a gene for pituitary secretion of gonoadotropic hormones was deleted at the 17q22 segment.
Previous pharmacological studies have implicated serotonergic brain systems in opiate withdrawal. To test the hypothesis that serotonin (5-HT) has a critical role in the development of opiate withdrawal, we have employed a near-total brain 5-HT system lesion technique (90% depletion) using 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine combined with induction of opiate dependence by implantation of morphine pellets or by repeated injections of increasing doses of morphine. The effects of serotonergic neuron lesion were examined on spontaneous opiate withdrawal (changes in circadian locomotor activity) and naloxone-precipitated opiate withdrawal syndrome (the somatic aspect). The antiwithdrawal properties of clonidine, an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist currently used for clinical treatment for the somatic signs of opiate withdrawal, were tested also in the lesioned rats. Our findings show that serotonergic lesions in morphine-dependent rats did not alter either the spontaneous or the naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome (with exception of jumping behavior). Moreover, clonidine alleviated the naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome in lesioned as well as in sham-operated morphine-dependent rats. These results demonstrate that 5-HT systems are not directly responsible for the development of the somatic opiate withdrawal syndrome in morphine-dependent rats.
The nephrotoxicity of amikacin and kanamycin was investigated in 110 female albino Wistar rats. The drugs were administered i.m. in different dosages (2.5; 5; 10; 20; 100 and 500 mg/kg/day; dosage interval: 12 h) over a period of 5 days. The excretion of tubular cells and urinary enzymes (MDH, LDH and GOT) was assessed before, during and after administration of the antibioitcs. In addition, the concentration of serum urea was analysed and the kidneys were investigated histologically. These investigations show that both the aminoglycosides are tubulotoxic, in higher dosages glomerulotoxic, too. The toxic threshold doses were found to be within the range of human therapeutic dosages: amikacin: 10 mg/kg/day, kanamycin: 5 mg/kg/day.
The influences of the indirect serotonin agonist fenfluramine (5; 10 mg/kg s.c.), the serotonin antagonist metergoline (5; 10 mg/kg s.c.) and the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OHDPAT (0.1; 0.2; 0.46 mg/kg s.c.) on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats or mice and on morphine-induced catalepsy in rats were studied. Morphine-induced catalepsy was enhanced by fenfluramine and attenuated by metergoline, whereas neither fenfluramine nor metergoline had any effect on haloperidol-induced catalepsy. 8-OHDPAT strongly antagonised catalepsy induced by morphine or haloperidol. We conclude that serotonergic transmission plays a major role in effectuating morphine catalepsy but not in effectuating haloperidol catalepsy. The antagonistic effect of 8-OHDPAT suggests a secondary, modulating role for 5-HT1A receptor mediated events in both types of catalepsy.
Little is known regarding how prescribing patterns of hormonal contraceptives to adolescents in the United States have changed over time as new formulations become available and knowledge of thrombosis risk increases. Desogestrel and high-dose estrogen-containing formulations have been associated with a higher risk of thrombosis than other methods.
We used the National Ambulatory Medical Care/National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care surveys to describe trends in contraception prescriptions for 11- to 21-year-old females between 1993 and 2004.
The majority of prescriptions arose from obstetrics/gynecology clinics. The proportion of desogestrel-containing prescriptions was approximately 10% throughout the study period. Ortho Evra (transdermal norelgestromin, ethinyl estradiol) and Yasmin (oral drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol) accounted for a steadily increasing proportion of prescriptions.
With regard to contraception and thrombosis risk, a significant minority of adolescents are prescribed desogestrel-containing contraceptives, and a greater number are exposed to higher levels of estrogen from transdermal contraception. Future studies are needed to evaluate the absolute risk of thrombosis in adolescents using these formulations so clinicians have accurate safety information when prescribing to this unique population.
The bioassay-guided fractionation of dried flowers of Butea monosperma (BM) was carried out to isolate the active principle responsible for its anticonvulsant activity. The petroleum ether extract was fractionated by column chromatography using solvents of varying polarity such as n-hexane, n-hexane:ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and methanol. The anticonvulsive principle of B. monosperma was found to be a triterpene (TBM) present in the n-hexane:ethyl acetate (1:1) fraction of the petroleum ether extract. TBM exhibited anticonvulsant activity against seizures induced by maximum electroshock (MES) and its PD(50) was found to be 34.2+/-18.1 mg/kg. TBM also inhibited seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), electrical kindling, and the combination of lithium sulfate and pilocarpine nitrate (Li-Pilo). However, TBM was not effective against seizures induced by strychnine and picrotoxin. TBM exhibited depressant effect on the central nervous system. After repeated use for 7 days, the PD(50) (MES) of TBM increased to 51.5+/-12.1 mg/kg. Similarly, after repeated use of TBM, the duration of sleep induced by pentobarbital was not reduced significantly. Further studies are required to investigate its usefulness in the treatment of epilepsy.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the eighth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. The risk of developing HNSCC increases with exposure to tobacco, alcohol and infection with human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV-associated HNSCCs have a distinct risk profile and improved prognosis compared to cancers associated with tobacco and alcohol exposure. Epigenetic changes are an important mechanism in carcinogenic progression, but how these changes differ between viral- and chemical-induced cancers remains unknown. CpG methylation at 1505 CpG sites across 807 genes in 68 well-annotated HNSCC tumor samples from the University of Michigan Head and Neck SPORE patient population were quantified using the Illumina Goldengate Methylation Cancer Panel. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on methylation identified 6 distinct tumor clusters, which significantly differed by age, HPV status, and three year survival. Weighted linear modeling was used to identify differentially methylated genes based on epidemiological characteristics. Consistent with previous in vitro findings by our group, methylation of sites in the CCNA1 promoter was found to be higher in HPV(+) tumors, which was validated in an additional sample set of 128 tumors. After adjusting for cancer site, stage, age, gender, alcohol consumption, and smoking status, HPV status was found to be a significant predictor for DNA methylation at an additional 11 genes, including CASP8 and SYBL1. These findings provide insight into the epigenetic regulation of viral vs. chemical carcinogenesis and could provide novel targets for development of individualized therapeutic and prevention regimens based on environmental exposures.
The common sequence variants that have recently been associated with cancer risk are particular to a single cancer type or at most two. Following up on our genome-wide scan of basal cell carcinoma, we found that rs401681[C] on chromosome 5p15.33 satisfied our threshold for genome-wide significance (OR = 1.25, P = 3.7 x 10(-12)). We tested rs401681 for association with 16 additional cancer types in over 30,000 cancer cases and 45,000 controls and found association with lung cancer (OR = 1.15, P = 7.2 x 10(-8)) and urinary bladder, prostate and cervix cancer (ORs = 1.07-1.31, all P < 4 x 10(-4)). However, rs401681[C] seems to confer protection against cutaneous melanoma (OR = 0.88, P = 8.0 x 10(-4)). Notably, most of these cancer types have a strong environmental component to their risk. Investigation of the region led us to rs2736098[A], which showed stronger association with some cancer types. However, neither variant could fully account for the association of the other. rs2736098 corresponds to A305A in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein and rs401681 is in an intron of the CLPTM1L gene.
Although the definite etiology of Parkinson's disease is still unclear, increasing evidence has suggested an important role for environmental factors such as exposure to pesticides in increasing the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. In the present study, primary cultures prepared from embryonic mouse mesencephala were applied to investigate the toxic effects and underlying mechanisms of rotenone-induced neuronal cell death relevant to Parkinson's disease. Results revealed that rotenone destroyed dopaminergic neurons in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Consistent with the cytotoxic effect of rotenone as evidenced by dopaminergic cell loss, it significantly increased the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium, the number of necrotic cells in the culture and the number of nuclei showing apoptotic features. Rotenone exerted toxicity by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing reactive oxygen species production and shifting respiration to a more anaerobic state.
Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality in South Asians. However, its genetic etiology remains largely unknown. Cardiomyopathies due to sarcomeric mutations are a major monogenic cause for heart failure (MIM600958). Here, we describe a deletion of 25 bp in the gene encoding cardiac myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) that is associated with heritable cardiomyopathies and an increased risk of heart failure in Indian populations (initial study OR = 5.3 (95% CI = 2.3-13), P = 2 x 10(-6); replication study OR = 8.59 (3.19-25.05), P = 3 x 10(-8); combined OR = 6.99 (3.68-13.57), P = 4 x 10(-11)) and that disrupts cardiomyocyte structure in vitro. Its prevalence was found to be high (approximately 4%) in populations of Indian subcontinental ancestry. The finding of a common risk factor implicated in South Asian subjects with cardiomyopathy will help in identifying and counseling individuals predisposed to cardiac diseases in this region.
The use of cyclosporine-A/methotrexate (CyA/MTX) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis is safe and effective for patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation after preparation with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. We report 87 patients prepared for allogeneic transplant with busulfan 4 mg/kg/d orally for 4 days, followed by cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d intravenously for 2 days (Bu4Cy2). A marked increase in hepatotoxicity was observed in 20 patients administered CyA/MTX, compared with 67 historical control patients who received CyA/methylprednisolone (CyA/MP) for GVHD prophylaxis with all other treatment and support variables remaining constant. The incidence of hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL) increased from 48% to 80% (P = .02), and the mean maximal bilirubin increased from 4.67 +/- 7.27 to 8.72 +/- 8.73 mg/dL (P = .04), when CyA/MTX was used in place of CyA/MP for GVHD prophylaxis. In addition, the incidence of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) increased from 18% to 70% (P = .0001), and death caused by VOD increased from 4.5% to 25% (P = .02). Survival was not significantly different for the two groups because of a higher non-VOD death rate in patients receiving CyA/MP for GVHD prophylaxis (P = .77). We suggest caution when using Bu4Cy2 in combination with CyA/MTX for GVHD prophylaxis.
The effect of 24,25(OH)2D3 on 1,25(OH)2D3-induced hypercalcemia was studied in parathyroidectomized (PTX) rats for 10 days. Serum (S) and urinary Ca excretion (UCaV) were measured in (a) control rats, (b) rats receiving a daily sc injection of 54 ng 1,25(OH)2D3, (c) rats receiving 24,25(OH)2D3 in the same dose and same manner, and (d) rats receiving 1,25(OH)2D3 + 24,25(OH)2D3. Our results show that (i) 24,25(OH)2D3 alone does not increase SCa2+ in PTX rats, (ii) combined administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 + 24,25(OH)2D3 enhances the hypercalcemic response to 1,25(OH)2D3 without a parallel increase in UCaV, (iii) combined administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 + 24,25(OH)2D3 reduces the rise in urinary excretion of Ca2+ compared with that of rats receiving 1,25(OH)2D3 alone for 10 days, and (iv) these alterations are independent of parathyroid hormone.
We analyzed genome-wide association data from 1,380 Europeans with early-onset and morbid adult obesity and 1,416 age-matched normal-weight controls. Thirty-eight markers showing strong association were further evaluated in 14,186 European subjects. In addition to FTO and MC4R, we detected significant association of obesity with three new risk loci in NPC1 (endosomal/lysosomal Niemann-Pick C1 gene, P = 2.9 x 10(-7)), near MAF (encoding the transcription factor c-MAF, P = 3.8 x 10(-13)) and near PTER (phosphotriesterase-related gene, P = 2.1 x 10(-7)).
The transcription factor p73 plays critical roles during development and tumorigenesis. It exhibits sequence identity and structural homology with p53, and can engage p53-like tumor-suppressive programs. However, different pathways regulate p53 and p73, and p73 is not mutated in human tumors. Therefore, p73 represents a therapeutic target, and there is a critical need to understand genes and noncoding RNAs regulated by p73 and how they change during treatment regimens. Here, we define the p73 genomic binding profile and demonstrate its modulation by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inducer of p73. Rapamycin selectively increased p73 occupancy at a subset of its binding sites. In addition, multiple determinants of p73 binding, activity, and function were evident, and were modulated by mTOR. We generated an mTOR-p73 signature that is enriched for p73 target genes and miRNAs that are involved in mesenchymal differentiation and tumorigenesis, can classify rhabdomyosarcomas by clinical subtype, and can predict patient outcome.
We tested the hypothesis of beneficial effects of the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor simvastatin in a model of ischemia-reperfusion, and investigated potential mechanisms.
Isolated working rat hearts were subjected to 15 min global ischemia and 22-180 min reperfusion in the presence or absence of simvastatin (10-100 microM). We evaluated creatinephosphokinase and nitrite levels in coronary effluent, heart weight changes, microvascular permeability (extravasation of fluoresceine-labeled albumin), ultrastructural alterations, and the expression of endothelial (e) and inducible (i) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (by reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting) in the presence or absence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin-D.
Simvastatin (25 microM) significantly reduced myocardial damage and vascular hyperpermeability, concomitant with a reduction in endothelial and cardiomyocyte lesions. Protection became less evident at 50 microM and reverted to increased damage at 100 microM. At 25 microM, simvastatin significantly increased eNOS mRNA and protein compared with untreated hearts, probably due to a post-transcriptional regulation since unaltered by animal pretreatment with actinomycin D. Simvastatin also significantly decreased iNOS mRNA and protein, as well as nitrite production after ischemia-reperfusion. The addition of the NOS inhibitor N(pi)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, 30 microM) to 25 microM simvastatin-treated hearts significantly reduced cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion.
In this model, in the absence of perfusing granulocytes, the acute administration of a pharmacologically relevant simvastatin concentration reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury and prevents coronary endothelial cell and cardiomyocyte damage by cholesterol-independent, NO-dependent mechanisms.
Long-term effects of in vivo exposures to proestrogen methoxychlor (MXC) or estradiol-17beta (E) were studied during early pregnancy (preimplantation) in ICR mice. Pregnant dams received either subcutaneous injections of 1 microg of E on Day 2 of pregnancy only (vaginal plug = Day 1), or 5.0mg of MXC on Days 2-4 of pregnancy in sesame oil. Pregnant control mice were treated with the vehicle only. Litter size, postnatal survival, sex ratio at birth, and anogenital distance (AGD) in offspring of both sexes were examined, as well as vaginal opening in female offspring. High mortality rate was recorded in MXC-exposed offspring due to infanticide. Exposures to either E or MXC did not change sex ratio at birth, but the litter size was smaller in the former group. On postnatal Day 21, male pups exposed to either E or MXC at preimplantation stage exhibited shorter AGD than the controls, with the change most pronounced after MXC treatments. AGD in female offspring was unaffected after MXC exposures, but E treatments produced longer AGD in the females than that recorded in the controls. Preimplantation exposures to E or MXC also accelerated sexual maturation as significantly more females exhibited precocious vaginal opening at weaning. Our study shows that exposures to MXC or E at preimplantation stages cause long term alteration of sexual development during weaning in offspring of both sexes. Also, MXC treatments retarded both growth and weight of both sexes of offspring, in comparison to controls.
Peripheral neuropathy secondary to 5-flourouracil and capecitabine (Xeloda) has been reported. We report the first case of exacerbation of peripheral neuropathy related to topical 5-flourouracil (Efudex). A 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of actinic keratosis for 15 years was treated intermittently with topical application of 5-flourouracil. He also developed sensory peripheral neuropathy around the same time, but extensive work-up disclosed no clear etiology. In early 2005, he developed an exacerbation of his peripheral neuropathy following a 21-day course of topical 5-flourouracil for actinic keratosis, especially pain and parasthesias. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase activity was evaluated in the peripheral mononuclear cells both by radioassay and by [2-C] uracil breath test. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase activity was within the normal range by both methods. Stopping topical 5-flourouracil resolved the symptoms to baseline. Instead of topical 5-flourouracil, topical imiquimod was used which did not exacerbate his neuropathy. He was not re-challenged with topical 5-flourouracil. Topical 5-flourouracil has been known to cause mainly dermatological adverse effects, but systemic effects because of absorption are possible, especially in dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase-deficient patients. As our patient had no other cause responsible for his neuropathy, the onset of symptoms coincided historically with topical application of 5-flourouracil and the 5-flourouracil usage preceded an exacerbation of sensory symptoms, we conclude that this drug was responsible for his polyneuropathy.
Neuroendocrine and platelet markers of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor functioning are useful tools for studying the downregulation of 5-HT receptors, a leading hypothesis for the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. The 5-HT releaser fenfluramine raises body temperature as well as plasma concentrations of ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin. Pretreatment with the 5-HT1 antagonist pindolol did not block the hyperthermic response to fenfluramine, mediating its actions via non-5-HT1 receptor subtypes (presumably 5-HT2/1C). We observed blunted hyperthermic responses to fenfluramine in unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder. We also observed that the neuroendocrine responses to fenfluramine were decreased by chronic treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline but not by chronic treatment with tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline but not by chronic treatment with adinazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine with purported antidepressant activity. IC50 values for ketanserin inhibition of 5-HT-induced platelet shape change response, a marker of 5-HT2/1c receptors, were elevated after nortriptyline treatment in depressed patients, and this increase could be accounted for by those subjects who responded well to antidepressant treatment. Adinazolam treatment did not alter the platelet shape change response. Our data suggest that downregulation of 5-HT2/1c receptors may be linked to the clinical response of depressed patients treated with nortriptyline.
Bezafibrate is a known activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) that can activate both PPARalpha and PPARbeta. To determine the role(s) of these receptors in mediating the biological effects of this chemical, the effect of bezafibrate was examined in PPARalpha-null and PPARbeta-null mice. Wild-type, PPARalpha-null, or PPARbeta-null mice were fed either a control diet or one containing 0.5% bezafibrate for 10 days. Bezafibrate feeding caused a significant increase in liver weight in wild-type and PPARbeta-null mice compared to controls, while liver weight was unchanged in bezafibrate-fed PPARalpha-null mice. Gonadal adipose stores were significantly smaller in wild-type and PPARbeta-null mice fed bezafibrate than in controls, and this effect was not found in similarly fed PPARalpha-null mice. Analysis of liver, white adipose tissue, and intestinal mRNAs showed that bezafibrate caused similar changes of mRNAs encoding lipid metabolizing enzymes in wild-type and PPARbeta-null mice compared to controls. Interestingly, in PPARalpha-null mice, bezafibrate also induced several mRNAs previously thought to be solely controlled by PPARalpha, showing that the effects of this drug are not exclusively modulated by this PPAR isoform. Western blot analysis of liver protein was consistent with changes in mRNA expression showing that the alterations in mRNA expression correlate with protein expression in this tissue. Results from these studies demonstrate that the effect of bezafibrate is mediated in large part by PPARalpha, although some changes in gene expression are dependent on PPARbeta. In contrast to other PPARalpha ligands such as WY-14,643, induction of some target genes by bezafibrate can also be modulated in the absence of a functional PPARalpha.
