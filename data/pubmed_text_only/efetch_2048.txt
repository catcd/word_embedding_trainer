The girdling effect of the skeletal muscle wrap seems to be the primary mechanism of action of cardiomyoplasty. It is associated with a myocardial sparing effect. Myocardial sparing effect has been shown with an active muscle wrap or an active muscle wrap acutely turned "OFF". The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of a passive skeletal muscle wrap on cardiac energetics parameters and contractile reserve in a canine model of cardiomyopathy. Six dogs with adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy were studied. Three dogs underwent right latissimus dorsi adynamic cardiomyoplasty and 3 served as controls. Cardiac and coronary sinus catheterizations were performed at 0 and 6 weeks. A dobutamine stress test was performed at 6 weeks. Myocardial oxygen consumption was not reduced in the cardiomyoplasty group (139.20+/-86.90 Joules/min) compared to the control group (95.10+/-12.60 Joules/min, P = 0.27) at 6 weeks. Mechanical cardiac efficiency was increased in the cardiomyoplasty group (33.15+/-4.40%) compared to the control group (24.50+/-2.70%, P = 0.049) at 6 weeks. Left ventricular end diastolic diameter index was reduced in the cardiomyoplasty group (38.00+/-1.70 mm/m2) compared to the control group (46.30+/-1.55 mm/m2, P = 0.049) at 6 weeks. Indices of diastolic function -dp/dt, and tau were not significantly affected by adynamic cardiomyoplasty. Max dp/dt was increasing more in the cardiomyoplasty group than in the control group (P = 0.07) during dobutamine stress test. Mechanical cardiac efficiency was better preserved by the adynamic cardiomyoplasty. Myocardial contractile reserve might be better preserved with cardiomyoplasty.
A high-fat (HF) diet, the serotonergic system and stromal elements have all been implicated in colon carcinogenesis. We investigated whether the colonic serotonergic system could play a main role in the development of colonic dysplasia and stromal reactivity in carcinogen-treated rats under HF diet. For this, dimethylhydrazine-treated rats were fed with standard diet and a HF diet. Fat distribution was quantified by computerized tomography exam, serotonergic activity was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, gene expression, and immunohistochemistry, which along with histopathological technique enabled us to enumerate dysplasia, microvessels density, cell proliferation and COX-2 expression. We found that the HF diet induced an increase in the amount of visceral adipose tissue, even without expressive changes in the average body weight. This was correlated with a loss of serotonergic balance in colon tissue. Moreover, the HF diet promoted dysplasia and microvessel density in association with increased proliferation and COX-2 expression within pericryptal colonic stroma. Our current findings suggest that a HF diet promotes the enlargement of adipose tissue via loss of control in colon serotonergic activity, which enhances colonic dysplasia by supporting microvessel development.
Intraoperative monitoring of central nervous system functions is useful for safe neurosurgical operations. For such a purpose, some kinds of sensory evoked potentials play significant roles, but their reliability during general anesthesia have not yet been established. The authors conducted experimental and clinical studies to reveal effects of halothane, a most popular anesthetic, on sensory evoked potentials. Eight adult cats, weighing 2.8-4.0 kg, were induced to anesthesia with thiopental and ether, and after tracheostomy and venous cannulation, they were immobilized with succinylcholine and artificially ventilated with mixture of oxygen, nitrous oxide halothane. The concentration of halothane was increased up to 4.0% by 0.5% steps. The body temperature, systemic blood pressure and carbon dioxide concentrations in expires gas were monitored continuously, and maintained within normal ranges as much as possible. The hypotension induced by halothane was easily corrected by dopamine infusion initially, but later became difficult to be controlled as the halothane concentration increased. In each concentration, short latency somatosensory evoked potentials by median nerve stimulations (SL-SEP), and brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) were recorded. Active electrode was placed on the bregma, and reference electrodes were placed on a hindlimb for SL-SEP, on the tongue for BAEP recordings. Peak amplitudes of SL-SEP were gradually decreased and finally disappeared without apparent dose dependency. Relatively the peaks with longer latencies were more affected than those with shorter latency such as P1 and N1. In BAEP, decrement of the amplitude was apparent in the peaks with longer latencies with an obvious dose dependency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The authors report a D. Penicillamine-induced myasthenia gravis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. The disorder was revealed by a postoperative respiratory depression which could be attributed to the aggravation of the neuromuscular blockade by the muscle relaxants. D. Penicillamine-induced myasthenia gravis is now well known. The onset of such an accident after anaesthesia of patient treated with D. Penicillamine is a potential risk. Management of these patients in anaesthesia must be similar to the management of patients with classic myasthenia gravis.
Transplantation and pregnancy, in which two diploid genomes reside in one body, can each lead to diseases in which immune cells from one individual target antigens encoded in the other's genome. One such disease, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT, or bone marrow transplant), is common even after transplants between HLA-identical siblings, indicating that cryptic histocompatibility loci exist outside the HLA locus. The immune system of an individual whose genome is homozygous for a gene deletion could recognize epitopes encoded by that gene as alloantigens. Analyzing common gene deletions in three HSCT cohorts (1,345 HLA-identical sibling donor-recipient pairs), we found that risk of acute GVHD was greater (odds ratio (OR) = 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-4.6) when donor and recipient were mismatched for homozygous deletion of UGT2B17, a gene expressed in GVHD-affected tissues and giving rise to multiple histocompatibility antigens. Human genome structural variation merits investigation as a potential mechanism in diseases of alloimmunity.
The selective reduction of PAM cell yield reported by Carp and associates in the presence of tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has been attributed to replication in culture of a viral agent associated with MS (MSAA). We investigated the diagnostic potential of the PAM cell effect in MS and in optic neuritis (ON). Six serum and 7 CSF samples from 7 patients with MS, 3 serum and 3 CSF samples from 4 patients with idiopathic ON, and 4 sera from 4 patients with ON induced by ethambutal toxicity were tested. Blind counting showed no reduction in PAM cell yield in the MS group nor any significant difference between the two ON groups. Disturbing inconsistencies in PAM cell growth rates over time and between control flasks were demonstrated.
Enflurane has been implicated with both hepatic and renal toxicity. Others factors associated with similar dysfunction in the post operative period should be ruled out before the drug can be incriminated. We are reporting a case of mild post operative jaundice and transient renal insufficiency associated with enflurane anesthesia, which was eventually treated vigorously and successfully. The exact frequency of this kind of post operative complication is still unknown. Although other types of viral hepatitis cannot be completely ruled out, the anesthesiologist should be aware of the potential hazard of hepatic and renal toxicity attributed to enflurane. He should also be prepared to initiate vigorous treatment of the syndrome as soon as it appears so as to increase the chance for a successful outcome.
Male albino rats were orally treated in a single dose with 40 mg allyl alcohol/kg or 50 mg 4,4'-methylenedianilline/kg, or 100 mg 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane/kg, or 400 mg carbon tetrachloride/kg, or 800 mg chloroforme/kg, immediately after-wards exposed to increased temperature (35 degrees C, 50% RH, 4 h), and examined 20--22 hours later. Under these conditions, only carbon tetrachloride led to a more intensified changes manifesting themselves in changes of the serum enzymes LAP, ALAT, and GLDH, as well as in liver histology. The liver lesions, caused by the substances mentioned, reacted to an additional thermal strain in a comparable manner as the LD50-values determined under identical exposure conditions. The temperature-dependent enhancement of the carbon tetrachloride hepatotoxicity is ascribed to an intensification of liver peroxidation processes due to increased core temperature.
The expression and function of endothelin (ET) receptors are abnormal in cardiovascular diseases, tumor progression, and tumor metastasis. A previously reported promising radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) based on the non-peptide ET(A) receptor antagonist PD 156707 showed specific binding to target receptors in the myocardium but high accumulation in bile and intestine, probably because of its high lipophilicity. In this study we describe the synthesis of a series of fluorinated derivatives with hydrophilic building blocks. All compounds were evaluated as high affinity ET(A) receptor ligands (16, 17, 23-26, K(i) = 1.4-7.9 nM) with high subtype selectivity over the ET(B) receptor. [(18)F]3-Benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl-4-{3-[1-(2-{2-[2-(2-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}ethyl)-1H-[1,2,3]triazol-4-ylmethoxy]-4,5-dimethoxybenzyl}-5-hydroxy-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5H-furan-2-one ([(18)F]17) was synthesized as one of the radioligands of this series that possesses a higher hydrophilicity and an excellent stability in human serum. Improved clearance properties and specific uptake in target organs have been confirmed by biodistribution studies and small animal PET imaging.
To determine if prenatal nicotine exposure alters the postnatal development of the ventilatory pattern and the frequency and duration of apneas, we recorded respiratory airflow with head-out body plethysmography in awake neonates on postnatal days 1, 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18. Data from 12 nicotine-exposed animals were compared with data from 12 saline-exposed animals. Nicotine (6 mg/kg of nicotine tartrate per day) or saline exposure was induced by osmotic minipumps that were implanted subdermally on the fifth day of gestation in Sprague-Dawley Dams. Although both saline- and nicotine-exposed pups gained weight at the same rate throughout the studies, there were subtle differences in ventilatory indices between the two groups. Nicotine-exposed animals had a significantly higher breathing frequency on day 10, and a lower tidal volume on days 14 and 18. Although ventilation tended to be lower in the nicotine-exposed animals, the difference was not significant. There was a significantly higher frequency of apneas in the nicotine-exposed compared with the saline-exposed animals on postnatal days 1 and 2, but the apnea duration did not differ between the groups. No apneas were observed in any of the animals after the sixth postnatal day. Prenatal nicotine exposure is associated with a greater incidence of apneas on the first two postnatal days, and then an altered breathing pattern that manifests at a later stage of development.
Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), a new nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitor, has several beneficial effects, including the suppression of tumour growth and anti-inflammatory effects. DHMEQ can also suppress the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. In the present study, we examine the effects of DHMEQ on TNF-α production in vivo and on the survival of mice injected with LPS. When DHMEQ was injected into mice 2 h before LPS injection, the survival of the LPS-injected mice was prolonged. When DHMEQ was injected twice (2 h before LPS injection and the day after LPS injection), all the mice were rescued. The injection of DHMEQ 1 h after LPS injection and the day after LPS injection also resulted in the rescue of all mice. The serum levels of TNF-α in the mice that received both LPS and DHMEQ were suppressed compared to the mice that received only LPS. These results suggest that DHMEQ can be utilized for the prevention and treatment of endotoxin shock.
The investigation of rodent cocaine self-administration (SA) under conditions that promote escalating patterns of intake may provide insight into the loss of control over drug use that is central to human addiction.
This study examines the effects of daily long-access (LgA) SA of high or low cocaine doses on drug intake, extinction, reinstatement, and brain mRNA levels.
Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer cocaine during multiple-dose sessions. Short-access (ShA) rats were tested daily for multi-dose SA then remained in the chambers for 7 h with no cocaine available. LgA rats had access to low (0.5 mg/kg per infusion; LgA-LD) or high (2.0 mg/kg per infusion; LgA-HD) cocaine doses for 7 h after multi-dose SA. After 14 days, responding was extinguished, cocaine-induced reinstatement was determined, and preproenkephalin (ppENK), preprodynorphin (ppDYN), corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and dopamine D(2) receptor (D(2)R) mRNA levels were measured in various brain regions using a quantitative solution hybridization RNase protection assay.
Whereas SA was not altered in ShA rats and only increased during the "loading phase" in LgA-LD rats, a general escalation of intake was found in LgA-HD rats. LgA, particularly LgA-HD, rats were more susceptible to reinstatement than ShA rats. Caudate-putamen ppENK and nucleus accumbens D(2)R mRNA levels were elevated in LgA-HD rats. Overall, D(2)R mRNA levels were positively correlated with reinstatement.
The escalation of cocaine SA under LgA conditions is dose-dependent and is associated with heightened susceptibility to drug-induced relapse. The characterization of neurobiological alterations that accompany escalated SA should facilitate the identification of mechanisms underlying the onset of human addiction.
The antihypertensive action of clonidine (CLO) depends mainly on decreased release of the sympathetic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine (NE), at vascular neuroeffector junctions. The decreased release can be due to stimulation of alpha-2 adrenoceptors or other receptors in the brain or due to stimulation of presynaptic inhibitory alpha-2 adrenoceptors on sympathetic nerve endings. To compare central and peripheral contributions to the depressor action of CLO, renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and renal spillover of NE (RNEs) were measured at baseline and during reflexive increases in RSNA evoked by nitroprusside-induced hypotension (27, 50 and 105 micrograms/kg/min) before and after CLO treatment in adrenal-demedullated, anesthetized rats. Administration of CLO decreased RSNA by 52 +/- 8% and RNEs by 32 +/- 13% (means +/- S.E.M.). At levels of RSNA less than 50% above control, there were no significant changes in RNEs; above this level of activity RNEs increased, regardless of CLO treatment. CLO treatment did not alter significantly the relationship between increases in RSNA and in RNEs during nitroprusside-induced hypotension. The results suggest that in neurologically intact, anesthetized animals, CLO decreases renal NE release mainly by inhibiting sympathetic outflow, with little if any peripheral presynaptic action.
The present study investigated the role of cholinergic muscarinic receptor function within the basolateral amygdala memory in the consolidation of conditioned place preference (CPP) memory. Adult male Long-Evans rats were confined to treatment- or nontreatment-paired compartments for 30 min on 4 alternating days. After training, rats received intrabasolateral amygdala infusions of scopolamine (2.5 microg or 5.0 microg/0.5 microl) or saline. The rats were then given a 20-min test session, and the time spent in each of the compartments was recorded. Immediate posttraining (but not delayed 2 hr) scopolamine (5.0 microg) blocked acquisition of food- and amphetamine-induced CPPs. The findings indicate a time-dependent role for basolateral amygdala muscarinic receptors in memory consolidation underlying CPPs for natural and drug rewards.
Lymphedema, lymphangiectasias, mental retardation and unusual facial characteristics define the autosomal recessive Hennekam syndrome. Homozygosity mapping identified a critical chromosomal region containing CCBE1, the human ortholog of a gene essential for lymphangiogenesis in zebrafish. Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in seven subjects paired with functional analysis in a zebrafish model identify CCBE1 as one of few genes causing primary generalized lymph-vessel dysplasia in humans.
To determine if niacin can confer cardiovascular benefit by inhibiting vascular inflammation and improving endothelial function independent of changes in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels.
New Zealand white rabbits received normal chow or chow supplemented with 0.6% or 1.2% (wt/wt) niacin. This regimen had no effect on plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, or high-density lipoprotein levels. Acute vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction were induced in the animals with a periarterial carotid collar. At the 24-hour postcollar implantation, the endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 was markedly decreased in the niacin-supplemented animals compared with controls. Niacin also inhibited intima-media neutrophil recruitment and myeloperoxidase accumulation, enhanced endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation and cyclic guanosine monophosphate production, increased vascular reduced glutathione content, and protected against hypochlorous acid-induced endothelial dysfunction and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced vascular inflammation.
Previous human intervention studies have demonstrated that niacin inhibits coronary artery disease. This benefit is thought to be because of its ability to reduce low-density lipoprotein and plasma triglyceride levels and increase high-density lipoprotein levels. The present study showed that niacin inhibits vascular inflammation and protects against endothelial dysfunction independent of these changes in plasma lipid levels.
Cocaine addiction and overdose are a well-known public health problem. There is no approved medication available for cocaine abuse treatment. Our recently designed and discovered high-activity mutant (A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G) of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has been recognized to be worth exploring for clinical application in humans as a potential anti-cocaine medication. The catalytic rate constant (k(cat)) and Michaelis-Menten constant (K(M)) for (-)-cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed by A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G BChE (without fusion with any other peptide) have been determined to be 3,060 min(-1) and 3.1 microM, respectively, in the present study. The determined kinetic parameters reveal that the un-fused A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G mutant has a approximately 1,080-fold improved catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(M)) against (-)-cocaine compared to the wild-type BChE. The approximately 1,080-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency of the un-fused A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G mutant is very close to the previously reported the approximately 1,000-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency of the A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G mutant fused with human serum albumin. These results suggest that the albumin fusion did not significantly change the catalytic efficiency of the BChE mutant while extending the plasma half-life. In addition, we have also examined the catalytic activities of the A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G mutant against two other substrates, acetylthiocholine (ATC) and butyrylthiocholine (BTC). It has been shown that the A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G mutations actually decreased the catalytic efficiencies of BChE against ATC and BTC, while considerably improving the catalytic efficiency of BChE against (-)-cocaine.
To determine the relation between the presence of donor DNA polymerase and e antigen, and recipient hepatitis, we tested, under code, serums from a controlled trial of hepatitis B immune globulin used to treat individuals accidentally inoculated with HBs Ag-positive blood. All recipients lacked antibody to HBs Ag. In 29 of 31 donors, both polymerase and e were in perfect agreement; both demonstrated a highly significant correlation with recipient hepatitis (P less than 0.001). DNA polymerase/e-negative blood did not cause hepatitis. Blood containing polymerase or e antigen did not cause hepatitis in six of 31 and four of 18 recipients, respectively. Hepatitis did not correlate with transaminase or duration of antigenemia in the donor. Polymerase and e appear to be indicators of the relative infectivity of HBs Ag-positive serum, particularly after small-volume exposure. They may be important determinants in assessing infectivity of chronic carriers of HBs Ag and in evaluating efficacy of hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccines.
Platinum-based anticancer drugs cause neurotoxicity. In particular, oxaliplatin produces early-developing, painful, and cold-exacerbated paresthesias. However, the mechanism underlying these bothersome and dose-limiting adverse effects is unknown. We hypothesized that the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a cation channel activated by oxidative stress and cold temperature, contributes to mechanical and cold hypersensitivity caused by oxaliplatin and cisplatin. Oxaliplatin and cisplatin evoked glutathione-sensitive relaxation, mediated by TRPA1 stimulation and the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from sensory nerve terminals in isolated guinea pig pulmonary arteries. No calcium response was observed in cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons or in naïve Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells exposed to oxaliplatin or cisplatin. However, oxaliplatin, and with lower potency, cisplatin, evoked a glutathione-sensitive calcium response in CHO cells expressing mouse TRPA1. One single administration of oxaliplatin produced mechanical and cold hyperalgesia in rats, an effect selectively abated by the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031. Oxaliplatin administration caused mechanical and cold allodynia in mice. Both responses were absent in TRPA1-deficient mice. Administration of cisplatin evoked mechanical allodynia, an effect that was reduced in TRPA1-deficient mice. TRPA1 is therefore required for oxaliplatin-evoked mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, and contributes to cisplatin-evoked mechanical allodynia. Channel activation is most likely caused by glutathione-sensitive molecules, including reactive oxygen species and their byproducts, which are generated after tissue exposure to platinum-based drugs from cells surrounding nociceptive nerve terminals.
Histamine is an established growth factor for gastrointestinal malignancies. The effect of histamine is largely determined locally by the histamine receptor expression pattern. Histamine receptor H4 (HRH4), the newest member of the histamine receptor family, is positively expressed on the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, and its function remains to be elucidated. Previously, we reported the decreased expression of HRH4 in colorectal cancers and revealed its correlation with tumor proliferation. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the abnormalities of HRH4 gene in gastric carcinomas (GCs).
We analyzed H4R expression in collected GC samples by quantitative PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunostaining. Our results showed that the protein and mRNA levels of HRH4 were reduced in some GC samples, especially in advanced GC samples. Copy number decrease of HRH4 gene was observed (17.6%, 23 out of 131), which was closely correlated with the attenuated expression of H4R. In vitro studies, using gastric cancer cell lines, showed that the alteration of HRH4 expression on gastric cancer cells influences tumor growth upon exposure to histamine.
We show for the first time that deletion of HRH4 gene is present in GC cases and is closely correlated with attenuated gene expression. Down-regulation of HRH4 in gastric carcinomas plays a role in histamine-mediated growth control of GC cells.
This study was performed to examine the safety of reducing the long-term doses of furosemide administered to patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) stabilized on a standard medical treatment.
Twenty-nine patients with advanced CHF were treated with enalapril, digoxin, nitrates, and furosemide, as needed to alleviate their symptoms, and remained clinically stable for at least 3 months on those doses. Subsequently, the daily dose of furosemide was reduced to 1/3 of the previous dose, while the concomitant therapy was unchanged. All patients underwent a thorough clinical evaluation and right-heart catheterization before and 2 months after the furosemide dose reduction. After the treatment optimization the NYHA functional class decreased from 2.3 +/- 0.6 to 1.4 +/- 0.6 (p = 0.000), and the left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 22 +/- 10% to 32 +/- 13%, (p = 0.000). Clinical and haemodynamic evaluation before and after 2 months of treatment with lower furosemide doses showed that 24 of the 29 patients (83%) remained in a stable NYHA functional class and maintained a stable haemodynamic status. In the remaining 5 patients (17%), mean NYHA functional class increased from 1.8 +/- 0.4 to 2.4 +/- 0.6 (p = 0.07), accompanied by a significant increase of the right and left ventricular filling pressures from 4.2 +/- 2.7 to 9.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, p = 0.018 and from 8.6 +/- 3.0 to 19.8 +/- 3.6 mm Hg, p = 0.017, respectively. These 5 patients returned to a stable clinical status upon resumption of the prior doses of furosemide.
Most patients with chronic CHF who were clinically stabilized on high doses of furosemide remained stable on a maintenance dose equal to one-third of the dose needed for their stabilization. Patients unable to tolerate the dose reduction regained their previous clinical status following the resumption of the prior diuretic doses.
A study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine containing the S and pre-S2 antigens (GenHevac B Pasteur) was conducted in healthy newborn infants. All infants received 20 micrograms of vaccine within 24 hours after birth, at 1 and 2 months with a booster injection at month 12. The vaccine was administered alone in 19 infants born to low risk mothers, i.e. surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative and antibody to the core antigen (Anti-HBc)-positive mothers. The vaccine was administered in combination with 100 IU hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) at birth and one month in 18 infants born to high risk mothers, i.e. HBsAg positive mothers. In the group not receiving HBIg, the anti-HBs seroconversion rate at the 10 mlU/ml threshold was 50% one month after the first injection. In both groups, the anti-HBs seroconversion rates were 100% one month after the third injection and above 85% one month after the second injection. After booster injection, more than 90% of the infants had an anti-HBs titre above 1,000 mlU/ml that will probably provide them with adequate protection for several years. The kinetics of the anti-pre-S2 response was similar to those of the anti-HBs response and 100% infants in both groups had seroconverted one month after the second injection of the vaccine. The side effects were scarce, all mild and transient. Given the protective role of the anti-pre-S2 antibodies, the precocity of the response to pre-S2 antigen may therefore increase the effectiveness of hepatitis vaccination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol antioxidant that has been shown to facilitate osteogenic differentiation. A recent breakthrough has demonstrated that ectopic expression of four genes is sufficient to reprogram murine and human fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. However, the roles of resveratrol in the differentiation and cytoprotection of iPS cells have never been studied. In this study, we showed that, in addition to cardiac cells, neuron-like cells, and adipocytes, mouse iPS cells could differentiate into osteocyte-like cells. Using atomic force microscopy that provided nanoscale resolution, we monitored mechanical properties of living iPS cells during osteogenic differentiation. The intensity of mineralization and stiffness in differentiating iPS significantly increased after 14 days of osteogenic induction. Furthermore, resveratrol was found to facilitate osteogenic differentiation in both iPS and embryonic stem cells, as shown by increased mineralization, up-regulation of osteogenic markers, and decreased elastic modulus. Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in iPS cell-derived osteocyte-like cells was effectively prevented by pretreatment with resveratrol. Furthermore, resveratrol significantly increased manganese superoxide dismutase expression and intracellular glutathione level, thereby efficiently decreasing dexamethasone-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cytotoxicity. Transplantation experiments using iPS cell-derived osteocyte-like cells further demonstrated that oral intake of resveratrol could up-regulate osteopontin expression and inhibit teratoma formation in vivo. In sum, resveratrol can facilitate differentiation of iPS cells into osteocyte-like cells, protect these iPS cell-derived osteocyte-like cells from glucocorticoid-induced oxidative damage, and decrease tumorigenicity of iPS cells. These findings implicate roles of resveratrol and iPS cells in the stem cell therapy of orthopedic diseases.
ST-segment elevation is frequently induced by dobutamine in patients with a recent myocardial infarction and may represent dyskinesia of the infarcted region or myocardial viability and ischaemia. Revascularization of the infarct-related artery may abolish myocardial ischaemia, and thus represents a useful tool to verify the significance of this finding. The aim of this study was to assess the relation between ST-segment elevation and wall motion response during dobutamine echo stress test and to evaluate the effect of coronary revascularization with percutaneous coronary angioplasty of the infarct-related artery on stress test results.
Twenty-two patients (17 men; mean age 58+/-12 years) with a first acute myocardial infarction (5 anterior (23%) and 17 (77%) inferior) who showed ST-segment elevation during a dobutamine echo stress test performed early (7+/-5 days) after the acute event where included in the analysis. All patients underwent coronary arteriography followed by percutaneous revascularization with coronary angioplasty or atherectomy with or without stenting of the culprit lesion and a second dobutamine echo stress test at a mean of 40+/-20 days after revascularization. The minimal lumen diameter increased from 0.63+/-0.36 to 3+/-0.44 mm and % diameter stenosis decreased from 80+/-11 to 12+/-7 after revascularization. At baseline evaluation there were 62 normal moving segments (34%), 57 (32%) akinetic and 62 (34%) hypokinetic segments within the area at risk. Maximal ST-segment shift changed from a basal mean value of 0.41+/-0.6 to a peak value of 2.15+/-0.9 mm; angina developed in 6/22 patients (22%). A biphasic response to dobutamine indicative of myocardial ischaemia within the infarcted area was observed in 20/22 patients (91%) and in 54/74 (73%) segments showing wall motion abnormalities. After revascularization of the infarct-related artery 78 (43%) segments were considered to be normal, 46 (25%) akinetic and 57 (32%) hypokinetic. Dobutamine-induced ST-segment elevation in 6/22 cases (27%), but the amount of ST-segment shift at peak stress was significantly reduced (from 2.15+/-0.9 to 0.30+/-0.5 mm) and angina was present in 1 patient only (5%) despite a significant increase of double product compared to the pre-revascularization test (from 17,348+/-3536 to 21,005+/-4105, p < 0.003). At echocardiographic analysis, ischaemia involved only 4 segments (2%), 3 of them showing the persistence of a biphasic response to dobutamine.
In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and no baseline dyskinesia dobutamine-induced ST-segment elevation in the infarct-related leads is usually associated with a biphasic response of wall motion within the infarcted region and may be considered an ancillary sign of myocardial ischaemia because it is abolished in the great majority of cases by successful revascularization of the infarct-related artery.
