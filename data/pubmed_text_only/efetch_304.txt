During the past 18 years, sildenafil has evolved from a potential anti-angina drug to an on-demand treatment for erectile dysfunction and more recently to a new orally active treatment for pulmonary hypertension. Recent studies suggest that the drug has powerful cardioprotective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury, doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy and anti-hypertensive effect induced by chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthase in animals. Based on several recent basic and clinical studies, it is clear that sildenafil and other clinically approved type-5 phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors including vardenafil and tadalafil will eventually be developed for several cardiovascular indications including essential hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, ischemia/reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, ventricular remodeling and heart failure.
Paraplegia caused by intrathecal chemotherapy has no known pathognomonic features and is a diagnosis of exclusion.
The authors reported the clinical and neuroimaging findings in one patient with this syndrome.
The patient had severe paraplegia with urinary retention and impaired pain and touch sensation below T-10 with sparing of proprioception and vibration sense. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed diminished intensity throughout the central cervical spinal cord. Post-gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement was scattered throughout the cervical spinal cord and in two areas of the dorsal spinal cord. Axial views of the cervical spinal cord showed that this enhancement was limited to the lateral columns.
The MRI in myelopathy due to intrathecal chemotherapy may show a unique pattern of postgadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement limited to the lateral columns of the spinal cord. However, two recently encountered patients with the same syndrome did not show similar changes.
There are no controlled studies to determine whether propofol given after the onset of lidocaine-induced seizures (posttreatment) stops lidocaine-induced seizures. In this study, we determined whether posttreatment with propofol abolishes lidocaine-induced epileptiform electroencephalogram (EEG) activity as effectively as does midazolam, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics during lidocaine-induced epileptiform EEG activity and its treatment. EEG activity and CSF dynamics were determined in two groups of anesthetized rabbits at each of four experimental conditions: baseline, lidocaine-induced epileptiform activity, treatment with midazolam (n = 6) or propofol (n = 6), and return to baseline. The analog EEG signal was converted into a set of digital parameters using aperiodic analysis, and CSF dynamics were determined using ventriculocistemal perfusion. Propofol (3.8 +/- 1.3 mg/kg) stopped epileptiform activity, as did midazolam (2.0 +/- 1.7 mg/kg). The rates of CSF formation or reabsorption and resistances to CSF reabsorption or flow at the arachnoid villi did not differ among conditions or between groups. Our results indicate that propofol and midazolam both terminate epileptiform activity without changing CSF dynamics.
Propofol may be an alternative to benzodiazepines for treating lidocaine-induced epileptiform electroencephalogram activity in patients.
Sirtuin-1 (SirT1), a member of the NAD(+)-dependent class III histone deacetylase family, is inactivated in vitro by oxidation of critical cysteine thiols. In a model of metabolic syndrome, SirT1 activation attenuated apoptosis of hepatocytes and improved liver function including lipid metabolism. We show in SirT1-overexpressing HepG2 cells that oxidants (nitrosocysteine and hydrogen peroxide) or metabolic stress (high palmitate and high glucose) inactivated SirT1 by reversible oxidative post-translational modifications (OPTMs) on three cysteines. Mutating these oxidation-sensitive cysteines to serine preserved SirT1 activity and abolished reversible OPTMs. Overexpressed mutant SirT1 maintained deacetylase activity and attenuated proapoptotic signaling, whereas overexpressed wild type SirT1 was less protective in metabolically or oxidant-stressed cells. To prove that OPTMs of SirT1 are glutathione (GSH) adducts, glutaredoxin-1 was overexpressed to remove this modification. Glutaredoxin-1 overexpression maintained endogenous SirT1 activity and prevented proapoptotic signaling in metabolically stressed HepG2 cells. The in vivo significance of oxidative inactivation of SirT1 was investigated in livers of high fat diet-fed C57/B6J mice. SirT1 deacetylase activity was decreased in the absence of changes in SirT1 expression and associated with a marked increase in OPTMs. These results indicate that glutathione adducts on specific SirT1 thiols may be responsible for dysfunctional SirT1 associated with liver disease in metabolic syndrome.
Levodopa is administered with dopa decarboxylase inhibitors (DDI) to prevent its peripheral degradation. This increases conversion of levodopa to 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is synthesized from adenosine triphosphate and methionine (MET), serves as methyl donor for this O-metabolisation of levodopa with resulting conversion of SAM to total homocysteine (tHcy) via S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Previous studies showed augmented plasma levels of tHcy in long-term levodopa/DDI-treated patients with Parkinson's disease (PP). Objective of this study was to compare MET, SAM, levodopa, 3-OMD, tHcy and SAH in plasma of 20 levodopa/DDI treated PP and corresponding controls. A significant decrease of MET respectively SAM and an increase of tHcy appeared in PP. SAH with its short half-life did not differ. Levodopa/DDI long-term treatment contributes to altered levels of substrates of the O-methylation cycle in PP.
The epileptic brain is characterized by increased susceptibility to neuronal hyperexcitability. The rat lithium-pilocarpine model, which mimics many features of temporal lobe epilepsy, has been used to study processes leading to the development of recurrent seizures. After a prolonged seizure episode, termed status epilepticus (SE), neural changes occur during a period known as epileptogenesis and include neuronal cell death, reactive gliosis, axonal sprouting, and synaptogenesis. Extracellular matrix adhesion molecules are important regulators of synaptogenesis and axonal sprouting resulting from SE. SC1, also known as hevin, is an antiadhesive extracellular matrix molecule that localizes to synapses in the mammalian brain. In this study, the distribution of SC1 protein in neurons following SE was examined using the lithium-pilocarpine model. SC1 protein levels in neuronal cell bodies showed a transient decrease at 1 day post-SE, which coincided with an increase of SC1 in the synapse-rich neuropil that was identified with the synaptic marker synaptophysin. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the decrease of SC1 signal in neurons at 1 day post-SE and showed that SC1 remained localized to postsynaptic elements throughout the seizure time course. Increased colocalization of SC1 was detected with the excitatory synaptic markers vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), AMPA receptor subunit GluR1, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit NR1, but not with the inhibitory synaptic markers vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (VGAT) and GABA(A) receptor subunit beta2 (GABA(A) beta2), which could reflect enhanced association of SC1 with excitatory synapses. These findings suggest that SC1 may be involved in synaptic modifications underlying epileptogenesis.
Diazepam is frequently used for pre- and peroperative sedation. However, at i.v. injection local pain and thrombophlebitis are not uncommon, probably due to tissue irritancy of the various organic solvents necessary to keep diazepam in aqueous solution. In this study the incidence of local adverse effects following i.v. injection of Diazemuls, a new lipid emulsion formulation, was compared with that of Apozepam, a glycoferol-water solution. We found that the latter preparation caused local pain and thrombophlebitis as often as reported with propyleneglycol-phenylcarbinol-ethanol preparations (Stesolid, Valium) and in a statistically higher incidence that the lipid emulsion form, which therefore seems more suitable for intravenous use.
Differences between the pharmacological effects of bromazepam given by oral and rectal administration were investigated in mice and rats. 1) Bromazepam dose-dependently prolonged the sleeping time induced by thiopental-Na, ethanol and ether by both administration routes. 2) The analgesic action of bromazepam was recognized by the hot-plate method and the algolytic test. In the hot-plate test, analgesic actions of morphine and pentazocine were potentiated by bromazepam in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg by both routes. 3) The muscle relaxant effect of bromazepam administered rectally was more potent than that administered orally in the inclined screen test and the rotarod test. This effect of bromazepam by rectal administration was approximately 2 times as potent as that by oral administration. 4) Bromazepam inhibited the convulsion induced by maximum electric shock, pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin. In pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion, the inhibitory effect of bromazepam administered rectally was 2 times as potent as that administered orally. In the other convulsion test, no significant differences between oral and rectal administration could be recognized. 5) Hyperemotionality and muricide (mouse-killing behaviour) of rats with bilateral olfactory bulb ablations (OB rat) were reduced by oral and rectal administrations of bromazepam in a dose-dependent manner. The effects by rectal administration were more potent than that by oral administration. Bromazepam was approximately 20 times as potent as diazepam administered by the same route. Fighting behaviour in mice subjected to footshock was suppressed by rectal administration of bromazepam, and this effect was as same as that by oral administration. 6) The rate of lever pressing response in the lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation test in the Skinner box was markedly increased by rectal administration of 0.2 mg/kg bromazepam. 7) Methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity of mice was significantly suppressed only by bromazepam administered rectally in a dose of 5 mg/kg. 8) The falling effect of bromazepam on body temperature in normal rats was the same in both administration routes and was dose-dependent. From these data, significant differences of the pharmacological effects between oral and rectal administration of bromazepam were recognized in the duration of action and, in part, potencies; and therefore, rectal administration of bromazepam may be a useful dosage form for clinical use.
Vascular headaches are a relatively common phenomenon. Increasing numbers of patients with headache are being considered for treatment with the selective serotonin-receptor agonist sumatriptan succinate because of its potential for pronounced therapeutic efficacy in selected patients. Sumatriptan-associated myocardial infarction occurred in a 50-year-old woman with a history of migraine headaches. Cardiac risk factors that must be considered in all patients with migraine before initiation of therapy include concomitant ergotamine use, postmenopausal state, male gender older than 40 years, family history of heart disease, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, as reviewed in this report.
Among 3,129 dobutamine stress echocardiographic studies, a hypertensive response, defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) > or = 220 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP > or = 110 mm Hg, occurred in 30 patients (1%). Patients with this response more often had a history of hypertension and had higher resting systolic and diastolic BP before dobutamine infusion.
A substudy of the Lovastatin Restenosis Trial in patients with elevated cholesterol (>200 mg/dl) showed no evidence of an effect of aggressive lipid lowering on restenosis, confirming the results of the main trial.
To analyze the clinical date of 4 patients who developed very late stent thrombosis after implantation of sirolimus eluting stents.
From Oct. 2002 to Aug. 2006, 835 sirolimus eluting stents were implanted in 612 patients. From Jan. 2006 to Aug. 2006, very late thrombosis in sirolimus eluting stents occurred in 4 patients (0.65%), and which caused acute myocardial infarction in anterior wall. Emergency percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) were performed in 4 patients immediately after re-admission. The clinical date of the 4 cases were analyzed retrospectively.
These 4 patients were male with the age of 40-69 years. Very late stent thrombosis occurred 31-37 months after successful implantation of sirolimus eluting stents. Application of clopidogrel was stopped 7-12 months after first stents implantation. Aspirin was continued in 3 patients, while the other patient discontinued taking aspirin 18 moths before thrombosis occurred. Emergency coronary angiogram showed that sirolimus eluting stents in LADs were all occlude by thrombosis with TIMI 0 flow. All 4 patients survived after successfully primary PCIs.
Our report presents evidence of very late thrombosis in sirolimus eluting coronary stents, and more careful and prolonged flow-up was required in patients after implantation of drug eluting stents.
Many of the effects of resveratrol are consistent with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), which play key roles in the regulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis, and in the control of oxidative stress. We investigated whether resveratrol has protective effects on the kidney in type 2 diabetes.
Four groups of male C57BLKS/J db/m and db/db mice were used in this study. Resveratrol was administered via gavage to diabetic and non-diabetic mice, starting at 8 weeks of age, for 12 weeks.
The db/db mice treated with resveratrol had decreased albuminuria. Resveratrol ameliorated glomerular matrix expansion and inflammation. Resveratrol also lowered the NEFA and triacylglycerol content of the kidney, and this action was related to increases in the phosphorylation of AMPK and the activation of SIRT1-PGC-1α signalling and of the key downstream effectors, the PPARα-oestrogen-related receptor (ERR)-1α-sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Furthermore, resveratrol decreased the activity of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt phosphorylation and class O forkhead box (FOXO)3a phosphorylation, which resulted in a decrease in B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)-associated X protein (BAX) and increases in BCL-2, superoxide dismutase (SOD)1 and SOD2 production. Consequently, resveratrol reversed the increase in renal apoptotic cells and oxidative stress, as reflected by renal 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), urinary 8-OH-dG and isoprostane concentrations. Resveratrol prevented high-glucose-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in cultured mesangial cells through the phosphorylation of AMPK and activation of SIRT1-PGC-1α signalling and the downstream effectors, PPARα-ERR-1α-SREBP1.
The results suggest that resveratrol prevents diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice by the phosphorylation of AMPK and activation of SIRT1-PGC-1α signalling, which appear to prevent lipotoxicity-related apoptosis and oxidative stress in the kidney.
The influence of cholestyramine and chenodeoxycholic acid on the induction of cirrhosis of the liver of the male Wistar strain rats was studied. The simultaneous dietary exposure of 1 g cholestyramine in 100 g diet prevented the development of cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride. Whereas all the animals in the control group (CCl4-Exposure plus normal diet) developed cirrhosis, histologic examination showed cirrhosis in only 2 of 9 rats fed with diet containing cholestyramine. On the contrary, the exposure to chenodeoxycholic acid at a concentration of 1 g in 300 g diet potentiated the induction of cirrhosis. The experimental results support the clinical findings in which the administration of cholestyramine caused an improvement of liver function tests by cirrhosis.
We have previously reported a case study in which renal calcification formation may have been a complication of dexamethasone exposure in an infant with bronchopulmonary dsyplasia. To determine whether dexamethasone is associated with renal calcification formation, we conducted a prospective, nonrandomized study of 36 infants < 30 weeks' gestation and weighing < 1250 gm treated with dexamethasone because of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and compared them with a group not receiving dexamethasone. We identified seven infants in the dexamethasone group (n = 19) but no infant in the comparison group (n = 17) with renal calcifications at 2 months of age (p = 0.008). The urinary calcium excretion tended to be increased (15.5 +/- 16.6 vs 6.9 +/- 6.7 mg/kg/day ¿p = 0.05¿) and the calcium/creatinine ratio was significantly greater in the dexamethasone group (1.2 +/- 1.0 vs 0.6 +/- 0.4 ¿p = 0.02¿). Infants who received dexamethasone were significantly smaller 819.1 +/- 141.1 vs 954.6 +/- 141 gm ¿p = 0.008¿), were younger (26.2 +/- 1.7 vs 27.7 +/- 1.2 weeks ¿p = 0.004¿), received ventilator support longer (33.3 +/- 14.7 vs 12.1 +/- 14.7 days ¿p = 0.0001¿), and required more days of supplemental oxygen (54.3 +/- 9.7 vs 36.4 +/- 23.8 days ¿p = 0.009¿). We conclude that smaller, younger, and sicker infants are at the highest risk for the development of renal calcifications and that dexamethasone may be associated with increased urinary calcium excretion, which contributes to renal calcification formation.
The hypothesis is promoted that the arterial vessel can modulate the response to atherogenic factors. Patients with the same index of atherogenic factor may have different degrees of arteriosclerosis. The verification of this thesis needs a prospective study. The second fact described is the diminished experimental arteriosclerosis after treatment with the calcium antagonist Nifedipine (Corinfar).
As an unbiased functional screen to identify agents activating dendritic cells (DCs), we recently developed a DC-based biosensor system, in which a stable murine DC line XS106 was engineered to express the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) gene under the control of the IL-1beta promoter. Here we report that nystatin (NYT), an antifungal drug of the family of polyene macrolide antibiotics, elevated YFP expression by the resulting XS106-pIL1-YFP DC biosensor clone in a dose-dependent fashion. With respect to the underlying mechanisms, NYT activated the NFkappaB p65 and c-Rel subunits in the parental XS106 DC line. Moreover, NYT dose-dependently increased the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (MHC II), CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86 by murine bone marrow-derived DCs and triggered their robust production of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha. Our results document previously unrecognized pharmacological activities of the most commonly used antifungal drug to promote DC maturation.
We studied the hormonal background of the fluid derangements and arterial hypertension associated with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) treatment for infantile spasms in ten infants aged 5-22 months. They received a 6 week course of (carboxymethyl-cellulose-)ACTH: 80 IU at 0800 hours daily in weeks 1-3, then tapering, and termination at the end of week 6. The infants showed large, variable increases in 24 h urine cortisol during treatment. The mean plasma cortisol concentration (24 h after ACTH injection) was not significantly increased, but was correlated with the relative dose of ACTH. The mean plasma aldosterone concentration decreased. No significant change occurred in plasma renin activity (PRA), or in the concentrations of renin substrate (RS) or arginine vasopressin (AVP). Seven infants developed arterial hypertension, which was severe in three. This severe hypertension was associated with the highest relative ACTH doses and the highest plasma RS and cortisol concentrations. In the group as a whole, systolic blood pressure correlated with plasma RS and cortisol concentrations, but not with the other parameters. At the end of treatment urine and plasma cortisol dropped below the pretreatment levels and stayed low for greater than 2 weeks. There was a sharp peak in PRA and plasma aldosterone concentration, and a decrease in plasma RS. Plasma AVP levels dropped markedly. The mean body weight increased sharply and urine flow decreased. Mean plasma electrolyte levels remained unaltered. The danger at termination of ACTH treatment appears to be associated with a sudden transition from hypercortisolism to hypocortisolism, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, and suppression of AVP secretion.
The inhalation challenge with lysine-aspirin (L-ASA) using the dosimeter method allows the construction of a dose-response curve and the quantitative estimation of airway responsiveness to the drug. We assessed the modifications of airway responsiveness to methacholine in four groups of subjects: aspirin-sensitive asthmatics, aspirin-sensitive subjects with urticaria/angioedema, subjects with an equivocal history of aspirin intolerance and normal control subjects. The L-ASA challenge was positive in all aspirin-sensitive asthmatics. The pattern of bronchial response to the challenge was different from that observed after challenge with allergens or occupational sensitizers. The main difference was found in the recovery from induced bronchoconstriction. The recovery lasted from 3 to 6-8 hours, and a peculiar dose-response curve was obtained that we call "early prolonged reaction". In five of 18 ASA-sensitive subjects there was a significant increase in airway responsiveness. Airway responsiveness was normal in aspirin-sensitive nonasthmatic subjects and in the other two groups studied. We conclude that L-ASA inhalation challenge may increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness in some ASA-sensitive asthmatics. This presence of enhanced bronchial hyperesponsiveness seems to be a marker with which to distinguish ASA-sensitive asthmatics from ASA-sensitive subjects with urticaria/angioedema.
The activity of three anthelmintics (fenbendazole-FBZ; oxibendazole-OBZ; and pyrantel pamoate-PRT) was ascertained against the ascarid Parascaris equorum in horse foals on eight farms in Central Kentucky (2009-2010) in field tests. A total of 316 foals were treated, and 168 (53.2%) were passing ascarid eggs on the day of treatment. Evaluation of drug efficacy was determined qualitatively by comparing the number of foals passing ascarid eggs in their feces before and after treatment. The main purpose was to obtain data on current activity of these compounds against ascarids. Additionally, the objective was to compare these findings with those from earlier data on the efficacy of these three compounds on nematodes in foals in this geographical area. Efficacies (average) for the foals ranged for FBZ (10 mg/kg) from 50% to 100% (80%), for OBZ (10 mg/kg) from 75% to 100% (97%), and for PRT at 1× (6.6 mg base/kg) from 0% to 71% (2%) and at 2× (13.2 mg base/kg) 0% to 0% (0%). Although the efficacy varied among the drugs, combined data for all farms indicated a significant reduction of ascarid infections for FBZ (p < 0.0001) and OBZ (p < 0.0001) but not for PRT (p = 0.0953).
A technical grade of lactofen (1'[carboethoxy]ethyl 5-[2-chloro-4-[trifluoro-methyl] phenoxy]-2-nitrobenzoate) has been shown to induce liver tumors in mice. To determine a possible mechanism of action, the effect of exposure for 7 weeks to dietary concentrations of 2, 10, 50, and 250 ppm technical grade lactofen and 250 ppm of pure lactofen was studied for various liver parameters in groups of male and female CD-1 mice. Liver-weight to body-weight ratio, liver catalase, liver acyl-CoA oxidase, liver cell cytoplasmic eosinophilia, nuclear and cellular size, and peroxisomal staining were increased by the tumorigenic dose of lactofen, i.e., 250 ppm, in a fashion similar to the comparison chemical nafenopin (500 ppm), which is a peroxisome proliferator. Lower doses of lactofen that were reported as nontumorigenic had little or no effect on these parameters. Thus, pure and technical grade lactofen appear to induce murine liver tumors through a mechanism similar to epigenetic hepatocarcinogens of the peroxisome proliferating type.
Maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal growth. The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) of healthy neonates.
This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns. Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy (n=200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns (n=200 ears), whose mothers were non-smokers. Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low (<5 cigarettes per day, n=88 ears), moderate (5< or =cigarettes per day<10, n=76) or high (> or =10 cigarettes per day, n=36).
In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response (across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non-exposed neonates. Comparisons between exposed newborns' subgroups revealed no significant differences. However, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups. Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group.
In utero, exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells. These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns, regardless of the degree of exposure. Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate's hearing acuity.
A patient who had achieved marked improvement in vision and shrinkage of a prolactinoma following treatment with pergolide (0.1 mg/day) suffered a marked worsening of vision 7 months after continued treatment at the same dose. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the time of visual loss showed further shrinkage of the tumor and prolapse of the chiasm into the pituitary fossa. The dose of pergolide was cut in half (0.05 mg/day); 12 months later, vision had completely recovered. Brain MRI at the time of visual recovery showed no change in the position of the prolapsed chiasm. This is the 11th reported case of delayed visual loss following dopaminergic treatment of prolactinoma. Recovery of vision always occurs with reduction of the medication dosage. Many patients whose prolactinomas are treated in this fashion display chiasmal prolapse, and few suffer visual loss. Considering that visual recovery occurs without a visible change in the position of the chiasm, traction is an unlikely cause of delayed visual loss. Therefore, the term chiasmal traction syndrome, used to describe visual loss with prolapsed chiasm following surgical and radiation treatment of sellar tumors, should not be applied in this setting lest it prompt consideration of surgical chiasmapexy. The proper management is reduction of the dopaminergic agonist dosage.
Long-duration (> or = 6 months) polysomnographic studies of insomnia medications are lacking. This study evaluated the long-term efficacy of ramelteon, a selective MT1/MT2 melatonin-receptor agonist used for insomnia treatment.
Six-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
Forty-six investigative sites in the United States, Europe, Russia, and Australia.
Four hundred fifty-one adults (age > or = 18 years) with chronic primary insomnia.
Ramelteon, 8 mg, or placebo 30 minutes before bedtime nightly for 6 months.
Sleep was evaluated by polysomnography and morning questionnaires on the first 2 nights of Week 1; the last 2 nights of Months 1, 3, 5, and 6; and Nights 1 and 2 of the placebo run-out. Next-morning residual effects as well as adverse effects and vital signs were recorded at each visit. Rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects were evaluated during placebo run-out.
Over the 6 months of treatment, ramelteon consistently reduced latency to persistent sleep compared with baseline and with placebo; significant decreases were observed at Week 1 and Months 1, 3, 5, and 6 (P < 0.05). Ramelteon significantly reduced subjective sleep latency relative to placebo at Week 1, Month 1, and Month 5 (P < 0.05), with reductions nearing statistical significance at Months 3 and 6 (P < or = 0.08). No significant next-morning residual effects were detected during ramelteon treatment. No withdrawal symptoms or rebound insomnia were detected after ramelteon discontinuation. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity.
In adults with chronic insomnia, long-term ramelteon treatment consistently reduced sleep onset, with no next-morning residual effects or rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation.
To investigate the role of renin angiotensin system (RAS) activation in cyclosporine A nephropathy.
Rats were fed with low salt diet. After seven days, they were randomly divided into four groups: vehicle (n=7), CsA treated (n=7), CsA+verapamil (n=7), CsA+enalapril (n=7). All rats except vehicle received a daily subcutaneous injection of CsA (15 mg/kg) for four weeks. Plasma and renal tissue angiotensin II (Ang II) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) was examined by Northern blot.
Plasma and renal tissue angiotensin II levels were significantly elevated in CsA treated rats when compared to that in vehicle rats ((190+/-36)ng/L vs. (492+/-92)ng/L, (29.8+/-6.0)ng/g vs. (8.7+/-1.7) ng/g, P<0.001). Enalapril reduced angiotensin II levels significantly (both P<0.05). The expression of AT1R mRNA was down-regulated by CsA, this down-regulation was reversed by enalapril. CsA treated animals showed marked tubulointerstitial fibrosis, enalapril lessened the tubulointerstitial fibrosis significantly (P<0.05). Verapamil did not improve tubulointerstitial fibrosis significantly (P>0.05).
RAS activation plays an important part in CsA nephropathy. Blockade of RAS may retard the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis caused by CsA.
