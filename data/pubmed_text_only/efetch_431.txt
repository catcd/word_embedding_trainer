Maneb, a widely used fungicide, has been associated with Parkinsonism in humans. In experimental models, maneb and its major active element, manganese ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate (Mn-EBDC) cause selective nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in mice and in rats, respectively. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this neurodegeneration, we studied the effects of Mn-EBDC on proteasomal function, which is decreased in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), in a dopaminergic neuronal cell line (MES 23.5 or MES). The results demonstrated that exposure of MES cells to 6 microM Mn-EBDC for 7 days produced not only significant neurotoxicity but also inhibition of proteasomal chymotrypsin-like and postglutamyl peptidase activities. Proteasomal dysfunction was accompanied by formation of cytoplasmic inclusions that were positive for alpha-synuclein immunostaining and significantly increased sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble alpha-synuclein aggregation seen by Western blot analysis. In addition, there was a significant increase in oxidative stress, evidenced by elevated total protein carbonyl content, in cells treated with Mn-EBDC. Manipulation of intracellular reduced glutathione levels with N-acetyl-L-cysteine or L-buthionine sulfoximine pretreatment to modulate Mn-EBDC-mediated oxidative stress altered Mn-EBDC-mediated neurotoxicity, proteasomal dysfunction, and alpha-synuclein aggregation in these cells. These data suggest that neurotoxicity-induced by Mn-EBDC is at least partially attributable to Mn-EBDC-mediated proteasomal inhibition, and that the proteasome may be an important target by which environmental exposure modifies the risk for developing PD in vulnerable populations.
A 69-year-old man underwent a total knee arthroplasty. Spinal anesthesia was attempted, but when unsuccessful, a general anesthesia was given. The surgery and rehabilitation were uneventful until postoperative day 3 when a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed. He was placed on enoxaparin at a therapeutic dose that begun more than 72 hours after his attempted spinal. He developed a spinal hematoma and was paralyzed. The literature has no recommendations for using enoxaparin at therapeutic doses after regional anesthesia. There is no previous report to suggest that a patient 72 hours after surgery is still at risk from a neuraxial hematoma.
The question whether hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arises from dedifferentiation of mature hepatocytes or from proliferation of liver stem cells is still debated. In the present study, we used retroviral-mediated genetic labeling to investigate the fate of mature hepatocytes in rats after administration of diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Mature hepatocytes were genetically labeled by intravenous injection of retroviral vectors containing the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene coupled to a nuclear localization signal (nls-LacZ) 1 day after partial hepatectomy. Liver biopsies performed after completion of hepatic regeneration showed that 18.3% of hepatocytes expressed the nls-LacZ transgene. Rats were then treated with DEN in drinking water for 12 weeks and sacrificed between 98 and 151 days after the onset of DEN administration. Clones of beta-galactosidase positive cells were observed, half of which (53%) also expressed the placental form of glutathione-S-transferase (GSTp), a marker of preneoplastic cells. HCCs of various sizes expressing GSTp were present in all animals. Careful examination of 90 HCCs revealed that 16 (17.7%) also expressed nls-LacZ. This figure precisely matched the proportion of labeled hepatocytes before DEN treatment (18.3%). In conclusion, a random clonal origin of HCC from mature hepatocytes is seen in the DEN model of hepatocarcinogenesis.
Solar burn reactivation, a rare and idiosyncratic drug reaction, has been reported with the use of a variety of drugs. This reaction is believed to be the result of exposure to ultraviolet light during the subsiding phase of an acute inflammatory reaction. It affects areas of the body that have been previously sunburned. We describe a 16-year-old girl who was receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and experienced a second-degree solar burn reactivation reaction to methotrexate. The patient had a mild sunburn on her face and shoulders the day she went to the oncology clinic for her interim maintenance chemotherapy with vincristine 1.5 mg/m(2)/dose and methotrexate 100 mg/m(2)/dose. Three days later, she returned to the clinic with a 2-day history of fever (<or= 100.2 degrees F), nausea, vomiting, and malaise; the sunburn on her face and shoulders also had become severe, without further sun exposure. Laboratory results revealed elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentrations, and her methotrexate level was elevated at 0.9 mM. The patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure, dehydration, methotrexate toxicity, and second-degree solar burn reactivation reaction. She was admitted to the children's hospital and treated with sodium bicarbonate, acetaminophen with codeine, ondansetron, and silvadene cream. On hospital day 3, the patient's methotrexate level decreased to less than 0.1 mM. The sunburn continued to heal, and after a 14-day hospital stay, complicated by a streptococcal infection, grade 3 mucositis, bacteremia, and mild gastritis and duodenitis, the patient recovered and was discharged. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship (score of 6) between the patient's solar burn reactivation and methotrexate. Although methotrexate-induced solar burn reactivation is rare, clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse reaction and consider delaying administration of methotrexate by 5-7 days if a patient reports ultraviolet-related erythema in the past 2-4 days or presents with a notable sunburn.
The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of bromodichloromethane (BDCM) - induced cell proliferation in different tissues of male F344 rats. Rats were administered at doses of 0 and 100mg/kg/day BDCM dissolved in corn oil by gavage for 5 days/week for 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Then the colon, kidney and liver were collected. No histologic lesions were observed in the colon of rats exposed to BDCM, while there were mild nephrotoxicity and marginal hepatotoxicity related to BDCM treatment. Moreover, BDCM enhanced cell proliferation in the colon and kidney but not in the liver. In colons, hypermethylation in E-cadherin promoter might be associated with inhibition of mRNA and protein expression after 12 weeks of BDCM exposure. In kidneys, BDCM decreased E-cadherin mRNA expression, accompanying with transcriptional activation of c-myc and cyclin D1. However, suppression of E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression occurred in the absence of significant changes in DNA methylation. Therefore, suppression of E-cadherin expression via hypermethylation or transcriptional activation of c-myc and cyclin D1 may be involved in BDCM-induced cell proliferation in different tissues of male F344 rats.
Acrylamide has been employed as an experimental probe to investigate biochemical and morphological changes in developing rat liver following toxin administration in pregnant rats. Non-anesthetized pregnant rats were given acrylamide by gastric intubation at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. The pups were divided into three groups: Group A, mothers were treated with saline (control group); Group B, mothers were treated with acrylamide from day D7 of gestation till birth (prenatal intoxication); Group C, mothers were treated with acrylamide from D7 of gestation to D28 after birth (perinatal intoxication). Acrylamide-induced biochemical changes (in liver and serum) and morphological changes (in liver) were studied in control and acrylamide-treated developing pups. Prenatally and perinatally administered acrylamide significantly increased lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione and total thiol levels in liver. Significant inhibition of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities was observed in liver tissue. Total lipids including cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly increased in the serum. Acrylamide treatment increased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities and inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity. Sodium and potassium concentrations were increased, but calcium, phosphorus and iron levels were significantly reduced in the serum. Acrylamide produced significant electrophoretic changes in serum proteins. The most noticeable change was splitting of beta-globulin into beta1- and beta2-globulins. Light microscopy showed acrylamide-induced fatty deposits, congested central vein, vacuolization and chromatolysis in hepatocytes. Ultrastructural studies revealed vacuolated cytoplasm, lipid droplets of variable size and mitochondria with damaged cristae and vacuolization. The nuclei in acrylamide-treated groups showed marked decrease in the staining of nuclear DNA.
We report a patient with abnormal saccades in association with anticonvulsant toxicity (phenytoin 27.5 micrograms/ml, phenobarbital 18.8 micrograms/ml). The patient looked toward visual targets either with multiple, small, hypometric saccades or with single slow saccades. These abnormalities resolved when anticonvulsant levels returned to therapeutic range. Thus, slow saccades may be clinical evidence of anticonvulsant toxicity.
A 2-year-old child with known neurologic impairment developed a dyskinesia soon after starting phenobarbital therapy for seizures. Known causes of movement disorders were eliminated after evaluation. On repeat challenge with phenobarbital, the dyskinesia recurred. Phenobarbital should be added to the list of anticonvulsant drugs that can cause movement disorders.
Caffeine acutely raises blood pressure (BP). The clinical significance of this effect depends on whether BP responses persist in persons who consume caffeine on a daily basis. Accordingly, the ability of caffeine to raise BP after 5 days of regular daily intake was tested in a randomized controlled trial. Individual differences in tolerance formation were then examined. Men (n=49) and women (n=48) completed a double-blind, crossover trial conducted over 4 weeks. During each week, subjects abstained for 5 days from dietary caffeine and instead used capsules totaling 0 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg of caffeine per day in 3 divided doses. On day 6, in the laboratory, they used capsules with either 0 mg or 250 mg of caffeine at 9:00 am and 1:00 pm. Systolic/diastolic BP increases as a result of 250 mg of caffeine remained significant (P<0.006/0.001) at all levels of previous daily consumption. Individual difference comparisons found that although half the subjects had complete loss of systolic and diastolic BP responses to the challenge doses, the other half showed no loss in BP response, even after using 600 mg of caffeine per day for the previous 5 days (F >7.90, P <0.001). The sexes did not differ in degree of tolerance formation. Daily caffeine consumption failed to eliminate the BP response to repeated challenge doses of caffeine in half of the healthy adults who were tested. Caffeine may therefore cause persistent BP effects in persons who are regular consumers, even when daily intake is at moderately high levels.
Genetic and molecular studies in humans and mice indicate that Runx2 (Cbfa1) is a critical transcriptional regulator of bone and tooth formation. Heterozygous mutations in Runx2 cause cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), an inherited disorder in humans and mice characterized by skeletal defects, supernumerary teeth, and delayed eruption. Mice lacking the Runx2 gene die at birth and lack bone and tooth development. Our extended phenotypic studies of Runx2 mutants showed that developing teeth fail to advance beyond the bud stage and that mandibular molar organs were more severely affected than maxillary molar organs. Runx2 (-/-) tooth organs, when transplanted beneath the kidney capsules of nude mice, failed to progress in development. Tooth epithelial-mesenchymal recombinations using Runx2 (+/+) and (-/-) tissues indicate that the defect in mesenchyme cannot be rescued by normal dental epithelium. Finally, our molecular analyses showed differential effects of the absence of Runx2 on tooth extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression. These data support the hypothesis that Runx2 is one of the key mesenchymal factors that influences tooth morphogenesis and the subsequent differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts.
Amiodarone was used to treat cardiac arrhythmias that had been refractory to conventional medical therapy. The first 70 consecutive patients treated with amiodarone in this study had at least 6 months of follow-up (range 6 to 24, mean 11) and form the basis for this report. Sixty-six patients were treated for ventricular arrhythmias and four for supraventricular tachycardias. Amiodarone therapy consisted of a loading dose of 600 mg orally twice a day for 7 days, and 600 mg daily thereafter. Doses were reduced only if side effects occurred. Because of frequent side effects, the dose was reduced from 572 +/- 283 mg per day (mean +/- standard deviation) at 45 days to 372 +/- 174 mg per day at 6 months. With a mean follow-up of 11 months in the 54 patients who continued to take amiodarone, only 4 patients had ventricular fibrillation. Three additional patients experienced recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia in long-term follow-up. All 70 patients had extensive clinical and laboratory evaluation in follow-up. Side effects were common, occurring in 93% of patients. Thirteen patients (19%) had to discontinue the medication because of severe side effects. Fifty-six patients had gastrointestinal side effects, most commonly constipation. All patients but 1 eventually developed corneal microdeposits, and 43 patients were symptomatic. Cardiovascular side effects were uncommon. Symptomatic pulmonary side effects occurred in seven patients, with unequivocal pulmonary toxicity occurring in five. Neurologic side effects, most commonly tremor and ataxia, occurred in 52 patients. Thyroid dysfunction occurred in 3 patients, and 32 patients had cutaneous abnormalities. Miscellaneous other side effects occurred in 32 patients. Amiodarone appears to be useful in the management of refractory arrhythmias. Because virtually all patients develop side effects when given a maintenance daily dose of 600 mg, lower maintenance doses should be used. It is unknown if the more severe side effects are dose-related. Amiodarone is difficult to administer because of its narrow toxic-therapeutic range and prolonged loading phase. More importantly, the first sign of antiarrhythmic failure may be manifest as sudden cardiac death.
Cypermethrin is a widely used synthetic pyrethroid insecticide. Previous studies showed that cypermethrin significantly decreased the fertility and reduced the number of implantation sites and viable fetuses in females impregnated by males exposed to cypermethrin. As yet, little is known about the mechanism of cypermethrin-induced reproductive toxicity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of cypermethrin exposure during puberty on steroidogenesis in mice. Young male mice were administered with cypermethrin (25 mg/kg) by gavage daily from postnatal day (PND) 35 to PND70. Results showed that the level of serum and testicular testosterone (T) was markedly decreased in cypermethrin-treated mice. Additional experiment showed that cypermethrin exposure during puberty markedly downregulated mRNA level of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) in testes. Correspondingly, protein level of testicular StAR was significantly decreased in cypermethrin-treated mice. Cypermethrin exposure during puberty did not affect the number of Leydig cells in testes. Although cypermethrin exposure during puberty did not affect the weight of testes and epididymides, the number of sperm in the cauda epididymides was significantly decreased in cypermethrin-treated mice. Taken together, these results indicate that cypermethrin exposure during puberty significantly disrupts T synthesis via downregulating the expression of testicular StAR. The decreased T synthesis might be associated with cypermethrin-induced impairment in spermatogenesis in mice.
Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer occurring in Caucasians with rising incidence. They are remarkably resistant to conventional anti-tumour therapies like chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Anti-tumour effects of phytochemicals such as allyl isothiocyanate or cinnamaldehyde have been demonstrated in various melanoma models in vitro and in vivo. Considering their high potency as transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1)-activating compounds, we examined the functional expression of TRPA1 channels in different melanoma cell lines as well as in non-malignantly transformed primary melanocytes. The presence of TRPA1 transcripts could be detected in most of the melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, single-cell calcium imaging and patch clamp electrophysiology confirmed the presence of functional TRPA1 channels in those cell lines. Proliferation assays revealed that allyl isothiocyanate and cinnamaldehyde clearly reduce the proliferation of melanoma cells, but this effect is independent of an activation of TRPA1 channels, making it unlikely that ionic currents through TRPA1 are responsible for the anti-tumour effects of mustard oil and cinnamaldehyde.
Ninety-seven elderly patients with stable angina were included in a 28-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of amlodipine 5-10 mg and isosorbide mononitrate 25-50 mg once daily. The total exercise time, as limited by angina, was recorded together with the median incidence per week of angina attacks and glyceryl trinitrate consumption. Safety was assessed by adverse event frequency, measurement of vital signs and laboratory parameters, and quality of life. At the final visit, the total exercise time was significantly greater relative to baseline with amlodipine than isosorbide mononitrate (final/baseline difference: 112.2 vs. 32.2, p = 0.016). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in relation to the incidence of adverse events. Once daily amlodipine provides significantly better control of stable angina than isosorbide mononitrate in this elderly population.
The antiarrhythmic properties of indecainide were studied in 15 patients with a history of a cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia. Programmed electrical stimulation studies were performed in nine men and six women with a mean age of 68 +/- 2 years and a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 41 +/- 4%. All patients had inducible ventricular tachycardia by programmed electrical stimulation while off all antiarrhythmic therapy. Patients were then tested on procainamide, 1000 mg, administered intravenously, and ventricular tachycardia could be provoked in 10 of 15 patients. Indecainide was given intravenously, 1 mg/kg. Indecainide did not significantly change the baseline heart rate, blood pressure, and QTc interval from control values. The PR and QRS intervals were significantly prolonged. Twelve of 15 patients were still inducible for ventricular tachycardia on indecainide. Procainamide protected 5 of 15 patients against ventricular tachycardia induction. In patients still inducible on indecainide therapy, the ventricular tachycardia rate was significantly slowed, from 281 bpm to 224 bpm on indecainide and to 215 bpm on procainamide. The effects of this new class IC antiarrhythmic agent appears similar to procainamide in patients with serious life-threatening tachyarrhythmias.
17 children with serious infections were treated for an average period of 9.5 days with 420 mg/m2/dose of amikacin every 8 h. The nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of this 'high-dose' regimen was studied. None of the children had evidence of nephrotoxicity. Of 9 children who could be clearly evaluated, 1 child experienced a delayed transient auditory dysfunction. 1 child experienced delayed serious deafness, but was receiving other ototoxic drugs. Despite the fact that the doses averaged 54.1 mg/kg/day, 5 children in our series had peak concentrations lower than that recommended for adults with serious infection.
The effect of midazolam on the hypoxic ventilatory response of eight healthy volunteers was examined during isocapnic rebreathing. The magnitude of the slope of the ventilatory response to hypoxia (VE vs SaO2) decreased from 1.48 +/- 0.24 to 0.70 +/- 0.13 L.min-1.%SaO2(-1) (means +/- SE, P less than 0.005) after midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV. The calculated ventilation at an arterial saturation of 90% also decreased from 28.6 +/- 4.4 to 19.9 +/- 2.7 L/min (P less than 0.05). Before midazolam, hypoxia to an SaO2 of 75 +/- 2% was associated with a 23 +/- 3 beats/min increase in heart rate; after midazolam, the increase in heart rate with hypoxia was only 4 +/- 2 beats/min (P less than 0.001). Additionally, a double-blind crossover study evaluated the effect of physostigmine on awareness and hypoxic ventilatory response after midazolam. The change in hypoxic response slope after physostigmine 2.0 mg IV (an increase of 0.28 +/- 0.34 L.min-1.%SaO2(-1] did not differ significantly from that after placebo (an increase of 0.03 +/- 0.22 L.min-1.%SaO2(-1], although physostigmine significantly increased awareness. It is concluded that a sedative dose of midazolam depresses hypoxic ventilatory response and attenuates the hyperpnea and tachycardia associated with hypoxemia. Furthermore, physostigmine-glycopyrrolate reversal of midazolam-induced sedation was associated with nausea (five subjects), vomiting (three subjects), and tachycardia without reversal of the depressed hypoxic ventilatory response.
Echinocystic acid (EA), a pentacyclic triterpene, was isolated and identified from the fruits of Gleditsia sinensis Lam. The protective effects of EA were evaluated in rat models with acute myocardial ischemia induced by isoproterenol and vasopressin. In the electrocardiogram of anesthetized rats, EA prevented the ST-segment depression induced by isoproterenol or vasopressin in a dose-dependently manner. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 was analyzed by RT-PCR. EA shows an elevation of Bcl-2 mRNA level in infarcted tissue induced by isoproterenol in rats. These results demonstrated for the first time EA has a cardioprotective effect and may be a natural drug.
Ionizing radiation and certain other exposures have been shown to induce genomic instability (GI), i.e., delayed genetic damage observed many cell generations later in the progeny of the exposed cells. The aim of this study was to investigate induction of GI by a nongenotoxic carcinogen, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (C3H10T1/2) were exposed to 1, 10 or 100 nM TCDD for 2 days. Micronuclei (MN) and expression of selected cancer-related genes were assayed both immediately and at a delayed point in time (8 days). For comparison, similar experiments were done with cadmium, a known genotoxic agent. TCDD treatment induced an elevated frequency of MN at 8 days, but not directly after the exposure. TCDD-induced alterations in gene expression were also mostly delayed, with more changes observed at 8 days than at 2 days. Exposure to cadmium produced an opposite pattern of responses, with pronounced effects immediately after exposure but no increase in MN and few gene expression changes at 8 days. Although all responses to TCDD alone were delayed, menadione-induced DNA damage (measured by the Comet assay), was found to be increased directly after a 2-day TCDD exposure, indicating that the stability of the genome was compromised already at this time point. The results suggested a flat dose-response relationship consistent with dose-response data reported for radiation-induced GI. These findings indicate that TCDD, although not directly genotoxic, induces GI, which is associated with impaired DNA damage response.
Cathinone is a pharmacologically active alkaloid that can be extracted from the leaves of the khat plant (Catha edulis). There are synthetic derivatives of cathinone entering the recreational drug market, including mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone, 4-MMC). There are discrepancies in the legal status of both the khat plant and its extracted alkaloids between the UK and the USA.
A 22-year-old man purchased 4 g of mephedrone powder over the Internet from a chemical supplier based in China. He initially ingested 200 mg of the mephedrone orally, with no perceived clinical effects, and thereafter injected the remaining 3.8 g intramuscularly into his thighs. Shortly after the injection, he developed palpitations, "blurred tunnel vision," chest pressure, and sweating and felt generally unwell; he presented to hospital with continuing features of sympathomimetic toxicity. His symptoms settled over the next 4 h after a single dose of oral lorazepam. Qualitative analysis of the urine and serum sample was undertaken using gas chromatography with mass spectrometric (GC/MS) detection, both positive for the presence of 4-methylmethcathinone. Quantitative analysis of the serum sample was undertaken by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection; the estimated mephedrone concentration was 0.15 mg/l. Routine toxicological analysis of the serum and urine specimens using a broad GC/MS toxicology screen did not detect any other drugs or alcohol.
This is the first case of isolated 4-MMC toxicity, with confirmatory analytical findings. It is important that clinical toxicologists and emergency physicians work together to ensure a better understanding of the toxicity of novel/emerging drugs such as 4-MMC.
Resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoalexin found in red wine and various plants, has been reported to up-regulate the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). However, this effect was neither long term in nature nor physiologically relevant at the concentration of resveratrol studied. In the present study, we investigated the effects of repeated treatments with a lower concentration of resveratrol on the expression of genes in HUVEC. The expression levels of eNOS and silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1) were up-regulated in HUVEC by repeated treatments with 1 μM-resveratrol for 6 d, but not with fenofibrate. Moreover, resveratrol treatment increased the expression of autophagy-regulated genes such as γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) and autophagy-related protein 3 (ATG3), the radical scavenger activity-related metallothionein-1X (MT1X) gene and the anti-inflammatory activity-related annexin A2 (ANXA) gene. In addition, resveratrol treatment down-regulated the expression of the cell-cycle checkpoint control RAD9 homologue B (RAD9B) gene. These results indicate the beneficial effects of resveratrol on the cardiovascular system.
Carbamazepine toxicity on cardiovascular system in the course of acute poisonings and long term therapy are observed rarely. It's toxic influence on action potential in Purkinje fibres and 4 depolarization phase expresses clinically as the His bundle and atrioventricular blocks especially in patients with cardiologic disturbances. We present case of 64-year old woman with ischaemic heart disease poisoned with carbamazepine who died because of severe arrhythmias in the course of myocardial infarction during first 24 hours of intoxication. Heightened awareness of high risk lethal cardiovascular complications in patients intoxicated with carbamazepine with history of heart diseases is needed.
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was used as a model of controlled myocardial ischemia to study the effect of intravenous dipyridamole on myocardial ischemia and coronary hemodynamics in 10 patients. All patients had 1-vessel coronary artery disease with visualized collaterals. Intravenous dipyridamole increased myocardial ischemia during inflations. ST elevation, as measured by intracoronary electrogram, increased significantly from the control inflation to the second inflation after dipyridamole injection (0.05 +/- 0.23 vs 0.44 +/- 0.43 mV, p less than 0.03). Of the 10 patients, 8 developed new or more severe angina with subsequent inflations after dipyridamole. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure increased significantly from the control inflation to the fourth inflation (15 +/- 8 vs 20 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). The coronary wedge pressure showed a decreasing trend with subsequent inflations after dipyridamole but did not reach statistical significance. The double product (heart rate X blood pressure) was not significantly altered by dipyridamole. The findings indicate that intravenous dipyridamole increases myocardial ischemia during balloon occlusion. The constancy of the double product and the trend toward a decrease in coronary wedge pressure suggest that dipyridamole may induce ischemia by reducing the amount of collateral flow through a coronary steal phenomenon.
A case report with review of the literature.
To highlight the need for careful magnetic resonance imaging evaluation for the presence of incidental lumbosacral dural anomalies before attempting caudal epidural interventions.
Pre-emptive analgesia through the caudal epidural route provides good postoperative pain relief in spine surgeries. Several precautions have been advised in the literature. Presence of sacral-dural ectasia should be considered a relative contraindication for this procedure.
A 50-year old woman underwent posterior instrumented spinal fusion for L4-L5 spondylolisthesis under general anesthesia. She received single shot caudal epidural analgesia at the start of the procedure.
After complete emergence from anesthesia, she had complete motor and sensory loss below the T12 spinal level, which reversed to normal neurology in 6 hours. Retrospective evaluation of the patient's magnetic resonance imaging showed an ectatic, low lying lumbosacral dural sac which had been overlooked in the initial evaluation. The drugs given by the caudal route have been accidentally administered into the thecal sac causing a brief period of neurologic deficit.
This unexpected complication has been reported only in the pediatric literature before. It is important to look for the presence of lumbosacral dural anomalies before planning caudal epidural injections in adults also. Sacral dural ectasia and other lumbosacral anomalies must be recognized as contraindications for caudal epidural pre-emptive analgesia for spine surgery. Other modes of postoperative pain relief should be tried in these patients.
Risk of hepatotoxicity from acetaminophen taken in therapeutic or modestly excessive doses is high in alcoholics and long-term alcohol users, cachexic patients and people taking drugs inducing acetaminophen metabolism on microsomal cytochromes P450. Interaction between alcohol and acetaminophen increases production of NAPQI--highly reactive and toxic metabolite of paracetamol. Elevation of transaminases activity (especially AST) and other evidence of hepatic injury in patient with history of both alcohol and paracetamol intake should be suspicied of alcohol--acetaminophen syndrome; in such cases treatment with intravenous acetylcysteine should be maintained as soon as possible. In study case of 23-year old alcoholic man admitted to Department of Toxicology in Poznań with symptoms of acute hepatic failure after accidental paracetamol overdose is presented. After 5 days long ACC infusions patient's state improved and 2 weeks later he left hospital in full recovery.
