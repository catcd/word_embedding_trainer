Cervical spinal cord hemisection leads to a disruption of bulbospinal innervation of phrenic motoneurons resulting in paralysis of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. We have previously demonstrated separate therapeutic roles for theophylline, and more recently serotonin (5-HT) as modulators to phrenic nerve motor recovery; mechanisms that likely occur via adenosine A1 and 5-HT2 receptors, respectively. The present study was designed to specifically determine if concurrent stimulation of 5-HT2 receptors may enhance motor recovery induced by theophylline alone. Adult female rats (250-350 g; n=7 per group) received a left cervical (C2) hemisection that resulted in paralysis of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. Twenty-four hours later rats were given systemic theophylline (15 mg/kg, i.v.), resulting in burst recovery in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve. Theophylline-induced recovery was enhanced with the 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist, (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI; 1.0 mg/kg). DOI-evoked augmentation of theophylline-induced recovery was attenuated following subsequent injection of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (2.0 mg/kg). In a separate group, rats were pretreated with ketanserin, which did not prevent subsequent theophylline-induced respiratory recovery. However, pretreatment with ketanserin did prevent DOI-induced augmentation of the theophylline-evoked phrenic nerve burst recovery. Lastly, using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, we showed for the first time a positive co-localization of adenosine A1 receptor mRNA and immunoreactivity with phrenic motoneurons of the cervical ventral horns. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that theophylline may induce motor recovery likely at adenosine A1 receptors located at the level of the spinal cord, and the concurrent stimulation of converging 5-HT2 receptors may augment the response.
Arsenic is a known human carcinogen. We have reported that brief exposure of pregnant C3H mice to arsenite in their drinking water during gestation induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in male offspring after they became adults. Tumor formation is typically associated with multiple gene expression changes, and this study examined aberrant gene expression associated with transplacental arsenic hepatocarcinogenesis. Liver tumors and nontumorous liver samples were taken at necropsy from adult male mice exposed in utero to either 42.5 or 85 ppm arsenic as sodium arsenite or unaltered water from day 8 to 18 of gestation. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis. Among 600 genes, arsenic-induced HCC showed a higher rate of aberrant gene expression (>2-fold and p < 0.05, 14%) than spontaneous tumors (7.8%). Overexpression of alpha-fetoprotein, c-myc, cyclin D1, proliferation-associated protein PAG, and cytokeratin-18 were more dramatic in arsenic-induced HCC than spontaneous tumors. In nontumorous liver samples of arsenic-exposed animals, 60 genes (10%) were differentially expressed, including the increased expression of alpha-fetoprotein, c-myc, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferases, and CYP2A4, and the depressed expression of CYP7B1. Real-time RT-PCR analysis largely confirmed these findings. This toxicogenomic analysis revealed several aberrant gene expression changes associated with transplacental arsenic carcinogenesis. It is indeed remarkable that expression changes occurred in adulthood even though arsenic exposure ended during gestation. Some of these aberrantly expressed genes could play a role in the development of arsenic-induced tumors, at least in the liver.
Cocaine addiction, as with other stimulant abuse, produces psychotic symptoms. Although often moderate to mild in severity, these symptoms are, nevertheless, associated with poorer over-all outcome. Recent studies suggest diminished nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission as a mechanism of a physiological deficit found in schizophrenia, failure of auditory sensory inhibition. Diminished inhibitory sensory gating also occurs in cocaine addicts, probably because of their increased catecholaminergic neurotransmission, which blocks the inhibition. In the present study, 11 cocaine addicts in the first week of detoxification were recorded electrophysiologically, after which the effects of 6 mg of nicotine gum, were assessed in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. The test was repeated 10 days later. Treatment with nicotine, but not placebo, briefly reversed the inhibitory abnormality on both test days. Although nicotine itself may not be a desirable therapeutic agent, because desensitization of nicotinic receptors limits the time course of its effect, the study identifies a previously unexploited therapeutic target for new drug development for the neuropsychiatric sequelae of cocaine addiction.
Treatment outcome was determined among a cohort of travellers who returned to the UK between February 2000 and February 2001 with New World cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by species of the Leishmania (Viannia) subgenus. Among 18 patients who completed treatment with 20 mg/kg/d of i.v. sodium stibogluconate (NaSb) for 20 d, early relapse of disease occurred in 2 patients with regional dissemination in 1 and mucocutaneous involvement in the other. Drug susceptibility testing in vitro of the clinical isolate from 1 of these patients confirmed tolerance to high concentrations of NaSb.
Groups of 60, 40, 40 and 60 F0 Wistar rats of each sex were fed a semi-synthetic diet containing butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in concentrations to provide intakes of 0, 25, 100 or 500 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively. The F0 rats were mated and groups of 100, 80, 80 or 100 F1 rats of each sex were formed from 40, 29, 30 and 44 litters, respectively. After weaning, the highest dose (500 mg BHT/kg/day) was lowered to 250 mg/kg/day for the F1 rats. The numbers of litters of ten or more pups at birth decreased with increasing BHT dose. At weaning, treated F1 rats had lower body weights than the controls, the extent of the reduction being dose related; the effect, which persisted throughout the study, was most pronounced in the males. The survival of BHT-treated F1 rats of both sexes was significantly better than that of the controls. No significant changes attributable to BHT treatment were found in the haematological parameters. F1 females on the highest dose showed an increase in serum cholesterol and phospholipids, and serum triglycerides were reduced in this group in both sexes. Dose-related increases in the numbers of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were statistically significant (at P less than 0.05 or lower) in male F1 rats when all groups together were tested for heterogeneity or analysis for trend. The increase in hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in treated female F1 rats was only statistically significant for adenomas (at P less than 0.05) in the analysis for trend. All hepatocellular tumours were detected when the F1 rats were more than 2 yr old. Tumours were found in many other organs of some of the treated rats, but their incidence was not significantly different from that in controls. The role of BHT in the development of hepatocellular tumours requires further elucidation.
Dopamine (DA) D2 receptor (D2R) agonists and antagonists can modulate self-administration behavior, conditioned place preference, and locomotor responses to cocaine. Low levels of D2R have also been observed in cocaine addicted subjects and in non human primates after chronic cocaine exposures. Prior studies had shown that D2R upregulation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in rodents trained to self-administer alcohol markedly attenuated alcohol preference and intake. Here we assess the effects of D2R upregulation in the NAc on cocaine intake in rats trained to self-administer cocaine. Following 2 weeks of i.v. cocaine self-administration (CSA), rats were stereotaxically treated with an adenovirus that carried the D2R gene to upregulate D2R in the NAc. D2R vector treatment resulted in a significant decrease (75%) in cocaine infusions and lever presses (70%) for cocaine. This effect lasted 6 days before cocaine consumption returned to baseline levels, which corresponds roughly to the time it takes D2R to return to baseline levels. These findings show that CSA and D2R in the NAc are negatively correlated and suggest that cocaine intake is modulated in part by D2R levels in NAc. Thus strategies aimed at increasing D2R expression in NAc may be beneficial in treating cocaine abuse and addiction.
This study was undertaken to examine in vivo the effects of cigarette smoke on cyclic reductions in coronary flow due to platelet thrombus formation in the stenosed coronary arteries of anesthetized dogs. The circumflex coronary artery of 21 mongrel dogs was stenosed 60 - 80%, with blood flow measured with an electromagnetic flow probe. After the administration of cigarette smoke, plasma epinephrine was elevated nine times the control level (p less than 0.001) and peak mean blood pressure was elevated one and one-half times control (p less than 0.01). The hematocrit increased several percent (p less than 0.01) with cigarette smoke, although blood gases and pH remained unchanged. In all 21 dogs, spontaneous reductions in coronary blood flow were greatly exacerbated in the stenosed circumflex artery as evidenced by the number of flow reductions, the increased size of the reductions and the rate of flow reduction. Nicotine administered intravenously in doses comparable to those achieved through absorption of cigarette smoke by the lungs provoked similar responses of alpha-adrenergic stimulation and potentiation of the platelet thrombus formation. An alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, was given (3 mg/kg) intravenously to inhibit the exacerbated platelet thrombus formation due to cigarette smoke or infused nicotine. In 18 of 21 dogs, an acute occlusive platelet thrombus was prevented 15 minutes after phentolamine and after phentolamine and after a cigarette smoke or nicotine challenge. This study confirms a link between cigarette smoking, platelet formation, and the potential for humans to develop an acute occlusive platelet thrombus in a diseased and stenotic coronary artery.
We have carried out a study on 52 patients treated during childhood with potentially ototoxic drugs. The evaluation of vestibular function was carried out long after treatment. In most of the cases there was a parallelism between hearing and vestibular deficit. Manifest impairment of the vestibular function was demonstrated in 4 subjects, without remarkable hearing loss, who had previously been treated with streptomycin during childhood. Furthermore, in the case of 19 subjects, a considerable deambulation delay was noticed (in one case it revealed itself after the fourth year of life) which was attributable to a real injury to the vestibular structures. Finally, almost all examined subjects showed a dysfunction of equilibrium and a noticeable tendency to kinetopathy.
To explore the possibility that gonadal hormones are required for triggering the postpubertal emergence of enhanced dopamine-related behaviors in rats with neonatal excitotoxic lesions of the ventral hippocampus (VH), we assessed behavioral changes in castrated VH lesioned rats. The VH of rat pups was lesioned with ibotenic acid on day 7 after birth (PD7). Rats were castrated on PD21. Novelty- and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity were tested on PD56, and apomorphine-induced stereotypic behaviors and locomotion were evaluated on PD98. As demonstrated previously, the VH lesioned rats expressed enhanced novelty-, amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced hyperlocomotion (PD56) as well as potentiated apomorphine-induced stereotypic behaviors (PD98) in young adulthood as compared with sham-lesioned counterparts. Castration had no significant effect on novelty-induced locomotion or apomorphine-induced stereotypies but potentiated amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced hyperactivity in lesioned rats. These results indicate that the absence of gonadal hormones not only does not prevent the appearance in adulthood of behavioral disturbances linked to increased DA transmission in rats with neonatal lesions of the VH but even exaggerates those linked primarily to the mesolimbic DA system.
Taurocholic uptake in ethinyl estradiol cholestatic rats is significantly lower than in untreated rats. In the days following treatment withdrawal there is only a slow increase in uptake, which is still statistically lower than normal at the 11th day. Taurocholic acid uptake behaves in a different way from biliary flow and the amount of excreted bile acids. The diversity could be attributed to a different behaviour of bile acid carriers at the sinusoidal and biliary membranes in the hepatocyte or to a normalisation of bile acid carriers and Na+,K+,-ATPase activity at different times.
We have used microarray technology to detect the effect of Guanxin No.2 decoction on gene expression in different areas of the myocardial infarcted heart of rats.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-200 g) were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated; coronary artery ligation; and coronary artery ligation plus administration of Guanxin No.2 decoction (10.0 g raw materials/kg per day by gavage). The experiment was carried out on day seven after ligation.
We found that the gene expression using microarray technology showed many differences in the border infarcted left ventricular area compared with the remote noninfarcted left ventricular area after administration of Guanxin No.2 decoction.
Guanxin No.2 decoction has a long history in treating ischaemic cardiomyopathy in China, but the molecular mechanism has been unclear. In this study we found that some important genes may have contributed to the cardioprotective effect of Guanxin No.2 decoction.
This study was done to evaluate whether injections of resveratrol, a natural compound found in the skin of grapes, had anabolic effects on degenerated intervertebral discs in a rabbit model. Two non-continuous lumbar discs were punctured in rabbits to induce disc degeneration. Four weeks and 6 weeks after puncture, the rabbits were treated by injections with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or resveratrol. At 4, 8, and 16 weeks after initial injection, rabbits were sacrificed and the spine was extracted for magnetic resonance image (MRI), mRNA expression, and histological staining. Resveratrol treatment resulted in stronger signal intensity in T2-weighted images. MRI grade showed significantly lower in the resveratrol group than the DMSO group (P = 0.039). In the resveratrol group, aggrecan gene expression was significantly increased than that in the DMSO group at 16 weeks after injection (P = 0.027). MMP-13 mRNA levels in the resveratrol group were significantly decreased than those in the DMSO group at 8 and 16 weeks (P = 0.006 and P = 0.048, respectively). In hematoxylin and eosin stain, resveratrol-treated discs showed the features of regeneration. Histologic grade revealed improvement in resveratrol-treated discs, compared with DMSO-treated discs (P = 0.024). These anabolic effects on degenerated discs indicate that resveratrol is a promising candidate for treatment of degenerative disc disease.
Euonymus alatus as a folk medicine in China has been clinically used to treat type 2 diabetes for many years, and also exerts beneficial effects on hyperglycemia of diabetic animals. Our previous studies have isolated kaempferol and quercetin from the extract of E. alatus. In the present study, we investigated the possible mechanism of antidiabetic activity of these compounds. Kaempferol and quercetin could significantly improve insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, further experiments showed that kaempferol and quercetin served as weak partial agonists in the peroxisome proliferator-agonist receptor gamma (PPARgamma) reporter gene assay. Kaempferol and quercetin could not induce differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes as traditional PPARgamma agonist. When added together with the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone to 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, they could inhibit 3T3-L1 differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. Competitive ligand-binding assay confirmed that kaempferol and quercetin could compete with rosiglitazone at the same binding pocket site as PPARgamma. Kaempferol and quercetin showed significant inhibitory effects on NO production in response to lipopolysaccharide treatment in macrophage cells in which the PPARgamma was overexpressed; rosiglitazone was less potent than kaempferol and quercetin. These observations suggest that kaempferol and quercetin potentially act at multiple targets to ameliorate hyperglycemia, including by acting as partial agonists of PPARgamma.
The present study was designed to examine whether neuroprotective agents, FK506 or cyclosporin A (CsA), applied to rats undergoing pilocarpine-induced seizures can minimize further development of the status epilepticus. In order to solve this problem, pilocarpine was injected in 60-day-old Wistar rats to evoke status epilepticus. When epileptic seizures reached a defined, moderate level of intensity, the rats received a single FK506 or CsA injections. During a 6-h period following pilocarpine injection, the animals were observed continuously and motor symptoms were recorded and rated. In epileptic rats injected with FK-506 or CsA, signs of significant amelioration of the course of epilepsy accompanied by longer survival periods were observed. Moreover, some differences between effects of the two agents were seen. The obtained results appear to show that, in addition to neuroprotective action, FK506 and CsA can exert also antiepileptic influences.
We report a case of primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) arising in the transverse colonic mesentery. A 24-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to Kagoshima City Hospital with complaints of abdominal pain and sensations of abdominal fullness of 5 months' duration. On palpation, a mass the size of an infant's head was noted in the right flank. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography showed a huge mass that consisted of multiple cystic components. On arteriography, a slight tumor stain appeared, with stretched and displaced tributaries of the right colic and middle colic arteries. Barium swallow examination demonstrated that the ascending colon was shifted to the right and small intestine to the left. We performed an en-bloc resection of the tumor in the transverse colonic mesentery, including the ascending colon, proximal jejunum (20 cm in length), and greater omentum. The resected tumor was 12 x 10 x 7 cm in size, 590g in weight, elastic soft in consistency, and multicystic. Histologically, the specimens showed a sheet-like proliferation of spindle-to-polygonal cells, and focally, the tumor formed rosette structures. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and mic-2. EWS-FLI1 chimeric mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Based on the above findings, we finally diagnosed the tumor as PNET of the colonic mesentery. There has been no recurrence for 20 months after operation. PNET arising in the mesentery is very rare, and we distinguished PNET from other tumors by immunohistochemical examination and by demonstration of the presence of EWS-FLI1 chimeric mRNA in the tumor.
The acute effects of oral hydralazine, 1 mg/kg, on coronary vascular resistance, coronary blood flow (estimated using the coronary sinus thermodilution technique), and myocardial oxygen consumption were evaluated in 10 patients with chronic (New York Heart Association class III and IV) nonischemic congestive heart failure. Central hemodynamic responses demonstrated a modest decrease in mean arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance (12%, 15% and 29%, respectively), while the cardiac index increased from 2.3 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.3 and left ventricular stroke work index from 24 +/- 3.7 to 28 +/- 3.4 (p less than 0.01). Heart rate and diastolic filling time did not change. Coronary blood flow increased approximately 50%, from 144 +/- 17 to 218 +/- 30 ml/min, and coronary vascular resistance decreased from 0.55 +/- 0.09 to 0.36 +/- 0.08 mm Hg/ml/min (both p less than 0.01). Oral hydralazine increased myocardial oxygen consumption by 33%, from 15 +/- 1.6 to 20 +/- 2.7 ml/min. Despite this moderate augmentation in myocardial oxygen consumption, the arterial-coronary sinus oxygen difference decreased from 104 +/- 6.2 to 94 +/- 7.5 and the myocardial oxygen extraction ratio decreased from 71% to 64% (both p less than 0.05). The ratio of coronary vascular resistance to systemic vascular resistance decreased with hydralazine therapy, while coronary blood flow increased from 3.5% to 4.3 % of total cardiac output. In this group of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, hydralazine had a favorable effect on the coronary circulation and improved the critical myocardial oxygen supply-demand ratio.
Treatment with agents interfering with the renin-angiotensin system retards the progressive course of proteinuric chronic renal disease. However, because of unwanted effects associated with such therapy, some patients cannot be treated with these drugs at all or may be administered only very small doses. To find an optimal nephroprotective strategy for these patients, we compared antiproteinuric effects of combination therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist in very small doses with treatment with either agent alone at greater, but not maximal, doses. We compared the concomitant use of benazepril, 5 mg, and losartan, 25 mg, and monotherapy with these agents in doses 2-fold greater.
This is a randomized, open, crossover study of 3 treatments in 3 periods of 4 months each. Twenty-four patients with primary glomerulonephritis and nonnephrotic proteinuria, recognized previously as not able to be administered high doses of drugs from these classes, completed the protocol.
Combined therapy decreased 24-hour proteinuria (-45.54% versus baseline) more effectively than either losartan (-28.17%; analysis of variance, P < 0.01) or benazepril (-20.19%; analysis of variance, P < 0.001) alone. Subgroup analysis showed that antiproteinuric effects of combination therapy, as well as losartan or benazepril alone, were significantly greater in patients with basal proteinuria greater than 2 g/24 h than in those with proteinuria less than this value (P < 0.001, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively). All therapies significantly decreased blood pressure (BP) compared with baseline, but there were no differences between treatments in BP changes.
The study shows that combination therapy with very small doses of losartan and benazepril was more effective in reducing proteinuria than greater doses of either agent in monotherapy, and this greater antiproteinuric efficacy was independent of changes in BP.
The effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) on cerebral ischemia induced by 10-min bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries in mice was studied. Severe impairment of memory was apparent when the passive avoidance test was carried out 48 hr after bilaterally induced ischemia. When GbE at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg was given p.o. 1 hr before the 10-min occlusion, there was a significant improvement in memory. The i.p. injection of ifenprodil (30 mg/kg) also showed improvement on learning tasks. The p.o. administration of flavonoid, a fraction isolated from GbE, showed high step-through latency on scopolamine-induced amnesia. All these findings indicate that GbE is beneficial for clinical use in amnesia accompanied with cerebral vascular disease.
The effect of Jen-San-Yaung-Jung-Tang (YJT) on scopolamine (SCOP)-induced amnesia was investigated in a step-through passive avoidance task in rats. It was observed that YJT (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg) significantly improved SCOP-induced amnesia and did not change the horizontal activity and pain threshold. YJT at 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg also did not change SCOP-treated horizontal activity and pain threshold. Furthermore, the antiamnesic effect of YJT at 1.0 g/kg on the SCOP-induced amnesia was augmented by physostigmine, but was not altered by neostigmine or scopolamine N-methylbromide. These results suggest that the antiamnesic effect of YJT could only be related to the memory-related process, and to an increase in central cholinergic neuronal activity.
Recently we have reported that ethane dimethane-sulphonate (EDS), the Leydig cell cytotoxin, caused marked atrophy of the adrenal cortex of adult male rats. The aim of this work was to examine whether a 9-day treatment with dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg/d) or ACTH (40 IU/kg/d), which started 4 days prior to administration of a single dose of EDS (75 mg/kg), influenced the response of the inner adrenocortical zones to the toxin. On day 15 after administration of EDS, adrenal weight was significantly decreased in saline treated rats, but glandular and serum corticosterone levels were not altered. In dexamethasone-suppressed rats, the effect of EDS was augmented; an additional decrease in adrenal weight was accompanied by reduced adrenal and serum corticosterone levels. In ACTH-treated animals EDS was ineffective. These results demonstrate that the deleterious effects of EDS on rat adrenal cortex can be prevented by ACTH and potentiated by dexamethasone.
Fenoldopam, a dopaminergic (DA1) agonist, has been reported to induce medial necrosis and adventitial inflammatory response in the splanchnic arteries in rats. This study was carried out to clarify the detailed time course of the inflammatory responses, using antibodies for the inflammatory cell markers, CD3 (T cell), CD20 (B cell) and ED-1 (macrophage), and inflammatory serum factors, IgG, IgM and C3. Rats were administered fenoldopam for 24 hours by intravenous infusion. Histopathologically, medial necrosis with hemorrhage was observed at the end of infusion, but it almost disappeared on day 7 post-infusion. Adventitial inflammatory responses with ED-1-, CD3- and CD20-positive cells were very slight at the end of infusion, became prominent with marked fibrosis on days 3 and 5, decreased on day 7, and subsided on day 14. The serum factors were first present in the area of medial necrosis, then shifted to the subendothelial space or cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells, and disappeared on day 14 post-infusion. Gaps in the external elastic lamina were observed on days 3 and 5 post-infusion, and IgG and IgM were present outside the gaps in the adventitia. These results provided us with more detailed information on the inflammatory responses following medial damage induced by vasodilators.
The mitochondrial form of thioredoxin, thioredoxin 2 (Txn2), plays an important role in redox control and protection against ROS-induced mitochondrial damage. To evaluate the effect of reduced levels of Txn2 in vivo, we measured oxidative damage and mitochondrial function using mice heterozygous for the Txn2 gene (Txn2(+/-)). The Txn2(+/-) mice showed approximately 50% decrease in Trx-2 protein expression in all tissues without upregulating the other major components of the antioxidant defense system. Reduced levels of Txn2 resulted in decreased mitochondrial function as shown by reduced ATP production by isolated mitochondria and reduced activity of electron transport chain complexes (ETCs). Mitochondria isolated from Txn2(+/-) mice also showed increased ROS production compared to wild type mice. The Txn2(+/-) mice showed increased oxidative damage to nuclear DNA, lipids, and proteins in liver. In addition, we observed an increase in apoptosis in liver from Txn2(+/-) mice compared with wild type mice after diquat treatment. Our results suggest that Txn2 plays an important role in protecting the mitochondria against oxidative stress and in sensitizing the cells to ROS-induced apoptosis.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors exhibit impressive activity against advanced renal cell carcinoma. However, recent clinical studies have shown an equivocal response to sunitinib in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. The tumor suppressor PTEN acts as a gatekeeper of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR cell-survival pathway. Our experiments showed that PTEN expression inversely correlates with sunitinib resistance in renal and prostate cancer cells. Restoration of PTEN expression markedly increases sensitivity of tumor cells to sunitinib both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, pharmacologic manipulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling with PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, GDC-0980, mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus, or pan-Akt inhibitor, GSK690693, was able to overcome sunitinib resistance in cancer cells. Our findings underscore the importance of PTEN expression in relation to sunitinib resistance and imply a direct cytotoxic effect by sunitinib on tumor cells in addition to its antiangiogenic actions.
