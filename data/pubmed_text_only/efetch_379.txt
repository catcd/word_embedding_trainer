Tandem Scanning Confocal Microscopy (TSCM) is a new form of microscopy that allows one to noninvasively "optically section" into intact structures and record microscopic images in real-time. In this study, we have evaluated the ability of this new technology to distinguish histopathologic changes in unstained living kidneys that occur coincident with the onset of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis.
The rats were anesthetized and a laparotomy was performed to expose the kidneys. Using a TSCM equipped with a 24x water-immersion objective, we viewed and recorded real-time images of subcapsular living uriniferous tubules and glomeruli of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis rats exhibiting different levels of proteinuria.
TSCM revealed a variety of histopathologic changes in the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis uriniferous tubules including dilation of proximal tubular lumens, loss of microvillous brush border, cellular debris in the tubule lumens, and focal regions of extensive tubular necrosis. Using the fluorescent probe carboxyfluorescein, we were able to demonstrate significant heterogeneity in the movement of this fluorescent probe through the uriniferous tubules (e.g., some tubules were completely blocked), and irregular patterns in flow of carboxyfluorescein through nephrotic glomeruli.
These observations indicate that TSCM is capable of revealing a variety of histopathologic changes in unstained, intact, living kidneys. In addition, many of the histopathologic features of the uriniferous tubules revealed by TSCM are difficult or impossible to distinguish in biopsied samples of renal tissue.
To determine the influence of the genotype and the level of expression of different enzymes involved in folate metabolism on the response to and toxicity of high-dose methotrexate treatment in pediatric osteosarcomas.
DHFR and Reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) semiquantitative expression was analyzed in 34 primary and metastatic osteosarcoma tissues by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The following polymorphisms were also analyzed in peripheral blood from 96 children with osteosarcoma and 110 control subjects: C677T, A1298C (MTHFR), G80A (RFC1), A2756G (MTR), C1420T (SHMT), the 28bp-repeat polymorphism, and 1494del6 of the TYMS gene. Treatment toxicity was scored after each cycle according to criteria from the World Health Organization.
DHFR and RFC1 expression was lower in initial osteosarcoma biopsy specimens than in metastases (P = .024 and P = .041, respectively). RFC1 expression was moderately decreased in samples with poor histologic response to preoperative treatment (P = .053). Patients with osteosarcoma with G3/G4 hematologic toxicity were more frequently TT than CT/CC for C677T/MTHFR (P = .023) and GG for A2756G/MTR (P = .048 and P = .057 for gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity, respectively).
The role of C677T/MTHFR and A2756G/MTR on chemotherapy-induced toxicity should be further investigated in pediatric osteosarcomas receiving high-dose methotrexate. Altered expression of DHFR and RFC1 is a feasible mechanism by which osteosarcoma cells become resistant to methotrexate.
In this study, the dose (50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg)- and time (30 and 60 min)- related effects of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), a neuronal specific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were tested on picrotoxin (5 mg/kg)-induced convulsions and memory formation in rats. The changes produced by these doses of 7-NI were determined on NOS activity and nitric oxide (NO) concentration in the brain. The effects of 7-NI were tested in animals pretreated (30 min) with L-arginine (500 and 1000 mg/kg). 7-NI, at 50 and 100 mg/kg, did not produce significant changes in NOS activity and NO concentration in the brain and memory formation. However, the convulsant action of picrotoxin was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in these animals. A time-dependent decrease in the activity of NOS and the concentration of NO, a promotion of picrotoxin-induced convulsions, and an impairment of memory were found in animals treated with 150 and 200 mg/kg of 7-NI. The larger and not the smaller dose of L-arginine raised the concentration of NO, inhibited picrotoxin-induced convulsions and promoted memory process. Either dose of L-arginine failed to prevent 50 and 100 mg/kg of 7-NI from inhibiting convulsions. The effects of the larger doses of 7-NI (150 and 200 mg/kg) were effectively prevented by the increase of NO and not the ineffective dose of L-arginine. These results suggest that 7-NI (50 and 100 mg/kg) decreases convulsions by a nonspecific mechanism and that an inhibition of NOS by the larger doses of it (150 and 200 mg/kg) results in proconvulsant action and memory impairment. The data further show that the margin between the protective and proconvulsant doses of 7-NI is relatively narrow. These results have been taken together with the earlier reports that 7-NI produces learning impairment and fails to increase the anticonvulsant effect of traditional antiepileptic agents on experimentally induced convulsions to conclude that 7-NI can never emerge as an anticonvulsant agent for clinical use.
In the present study, Nigella sativa oil (NSO), nigellone (polythymoquinone) and derived thymoquinone were studied to evaluate their effect on the formation of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) products from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL).NSO produced a concentration dependent inhibition of 5-LO products and 5-hydroxy-eicosa-tetra-enoic acid (5-HETE) production with half maximal effects (IC(50)) at 25+/-1 micro g/ml, respectively 24+/-1 micro g/ml. Nigellone caused a concentration-related inhibition of 5-HETE production (IC(50): 11.9+/-0.3 micro g/ml). Moreover thymoquinone, the active principle of NSO inhibited the production of 5-LO products (IC(50): 0.26+/-0.02 micro g/ml) and 5-HETE production (IC(50): 0.36+/-0.02 micro g/ml) in a similar way. The effects are probably due to an antioxidative action. The data may in part explain the effect of the oil, its derived thymoquinone and nigellone in ameliorating inflammatory diseases.
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) and its receptor, very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), are involved in fat accumulation in adipocytes. Here, we investigated the effect of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma agonist, rosiglitazone, on regulation of VLDLR expression both in white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese mice and in cultured adipocytes. Furthermore, to determine whether rosiglitazone directly regulates transcription of the VLDLR gene, we carried out luciferase assay with a reporter gene containing mouse VLDLR promoter region, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Four-day treatment with rosiglitazone increased the expression of VLDLR in WAT of ob/ob mice. Moreover, rosiglitazone increased the expression of VLDLR in cultured adipocytes. The PPAR-responsive element (PPRE)-directed mutagenesis analyses revealed that the PPRE motif in the VLDLR promoter region plays a significant role in transcriptional activation of the VLDLR gene in adipocytes. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that endogenous PPARgamma directly binds to this functional PPRE motif in the VLDLR promoter region. We also investigated the effects of rosiglitazone on insulin sensitivity and lipid accumulation in both ob/ob mice and apoE-deficient ob/ob mice. Rosiglitazone ameliorated insulin sensitivity in both ob/ob mice and apoE-deficient ob/ob mice, possibly through decreasing the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), increasing the expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in WAT, and increasing plasma adiponectin concentration. In ob/ob mice, body weight and WAT weight were significantly higher in the mice treated with rosiglitazone than those treated with vehicle. However, in apoE-deficient ob/ob mice, no significant difference in body weight or WAT weight was observed between the vehicle-treated group and the rosiglitazone-treated group. Moreover, rosiglitazone did not increase body weight and WAT weight in VLDLR-deficient mice. These findings indicate that rosiglitazone directly increases VLDLR expression, thereby enhancing apoE-VLDLR-dependent lipid accumulation in adipocytes.
A calcineurin inhibitor combined with methotrexate is the standard prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Everolimus, a derivative of sirolimus, seems to mediate antileukemia effects. We report on a combination of everolimus and tacrolimus in 24 patients (median age, 62 years) with either myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 17) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 7) undergoing intensive conditioning followed by HSCT from related (n = 4) or unrelated (n = 20) donors. All patients engrafted, and only 1 patient experienced grade IV mucositis. Nine patients (37%) developed acute grade II-IV GVHD, and 11 of 17 evaluable patients (64%) developed chronic extensive GVHD. Transplantation-associated microangiopathy (TMA) occurred in 7 patients (29%), with 2 cases of acute renal failure. The study was terminated prematurely because an additional 6 patients (25%) developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), which was fatal in 2 cases. With a median follow-up of 26 months, the 2-year overall survival rate was 47%. Although this new combination appears to be effective as a prophylactic regimen for acute GVHD, the incidence of TMA and SOS is considerably higher than seen with other regimens.
Ziram as a dithiocarbamate fungicide is widely used throughout the world in agriculture and as an accelerating agent is used in latex production. In order to investigate ziram-induced apoptosis/necrosis and its underlying mechanism in human immune cells, a human monocyte-like cell line (U937) was treated with ziram at 0.0312-2 μM for 2-24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂ incubator. Apoptosis/necrosis induced by ziram was determined by analysis of FITC-Annexin-V/PI staining and the intracellular level of active caspase-3 by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation analysis. We found that ziram induced apoptosis/necrosis in U937 in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as shown by FITC-Annexin-V/PI staining. DNA fragmentation was detected when cells were treated with 0.5, 1, or 2 μM ziram for 24 h. Ziram also induced an increase in intracellular active caspase-3 in U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and a caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK, significantly inhibited the ziram-induced apoptosis. Moreover, it was found that ziram induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release in U937 cells. These findings indicate that ziram can induce apoptosis/necrosis in U937 cells, and this effect is partially mediated by activation of intracellular caspase-3 and mitochondrial cytochrome c release.
Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor widely used for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. We report a patient presenting nonoliguric acute renal failure following omeprazole treatment. Both eosinophilia and eosinophiluria were observed, and the patient was diagnosed as having drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis. Renal failure spontaneously resolved when omeprazole was discontinued.
To describe the clinical findings and natural history in 22 carriers of an R460H mutation in the transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 gene (TGFbetaR2) from a five-generation kindred ascertained by familial aortic dissection.
13 of the confirmed carriers were interviewed and examined, and information about the remaining carrier was obtained from medical records. Clinical information about deceased individuals was obtained, when possible, from postmortem reports, death certificates and medical records.
There have been eight sudden deaths; the cause of death was aortic dissection in all six cases in which a postmortem examination was performed. Three individuals had undergone aortic replacement surgery. Dissection had occurred throughout the aorta, and in one case in the absence of aortic root dilatation. Subarachnoid haemorrhage, due to a ruptured berry aneurysm, had occurred in two individuals. Four gene carriers and one deceased family member who were investigated had tortuous cerebral blood vessels. One had tortuous vertebral arteries, two had tortuous carotid arteries and one a tortuous abdominal aorta. Two individuals were found to have a brachiocephalic artery aneurysm and a subclavian artery aneurysm, respectively.
Despite the predisposition to aortic dilatation and dissection, individuals did not frequently manifest the skeletal features of Marfan syndrome, with the exception of joint hypermobility. No one individual had ocular lens dislocation. Striae and herniae were common. There was some overlap with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 4, OMIM 130050, with soft translucent skin, which is easily bruised. Other features were arthralgia, migraine and a tendency to fatigue easily, varicose veins and prominent skin striae. This family provides further evidence that mutations in TGFbetaR2 cause a distinct syndrome that needs to be distinguished from Marfan syndrome to direct investigation and management of patients and shows the natural history, spectrum of clinical features and variable penetrance of this newly recognised condition.
Carvedilol is an alpha1 and nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with antioxidative properties known to protect against reperfusion injury in the heart, brain, and kidneys. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol improves postischaemic reperfusion and tissue survival in skeletal muscle. Sixteen Wistar rats underwent tourniquet ischaemia of the left hindlimb for 3 hours and 15 minutes at 27 degrees C. Single-fiber laser Doppler probes were inserted in the left and right anterior tibial muscles, and microvascular perfusion was measured until 2 hours after removal of the tourniquet. Perfusion indices for each 15-minute interval were calculated for the left hindlimb (tourniquet ischaemia) by dividing the postischaemic by the pre-ischaemic laser Doppler flowmetry values, and the geometrical areas under the curves representing a plot of perfusion index relative to time, measured in arbitrary units, were compared. Laser Doppler flowmetry values for the right anterior tibial muscle were compared. Tissue damage was measured by histomorphometry of necrotic areas and no-reflow zones in cross sections from the anterior tibial muscle 72 hours after ischaemia. Neutrophils were counted in the same sections. The treatment group received 1 mg carvedilol/kg body weight before ischaemia and 1 mg/kg immediately before removal of the tourniquets. The areas under the curves representing the plot of perfusion index relative to time were larger for the rats treated with carvedilol: 9.5 compared with 3.0 arbitrary units (p = 0.0003). Treatment did not change the laser Doppler flowmetry values for the right hindlimbs. The histomorphometric areas of necrosis in cross sections from the muscles were reduced from 88% (38-96%) in the control animals to 41% (7-85%) in those treated with carvedilol (p = 0.01), and the area of no-reflow was reduced from 20% (2-52%) to 0% (0-7%) (p = 0.006). The number of neutrophils did not differ between groups. The study supports the hypothesis that carvedilol improves early reperfusion and protects skeletal muscle subjected to 3 hours and 15 minutes of ischaemia.
Thiazides and amiloride are the most often suggested treatment for nephrogenic diabetic insipidus. We found this ineffectual in a patient with acute problems and reviewed the literature to see if there were other more efficient approaches. A 47-year-old woman on lithium had polyuria. When inadvertently fasted for 48 h she became confused, had a seizure, and her sodium was 170 mmol/L. Urinary output was 24 L/day. Large volumes of intravenous fluids were given but sodium remained > 170 mmol/L. Treatment with DDAVP, thiazides, and amiloride did not decrease urinary output. Indomethacin 150 mg was started and urine volume immediately fell to one-half. However, because of persistent high urine output the patient was then fluid depleted, with further reduction to normal in urine volume, and Na decreased to 140 mmol/L. Creatinine rose from 135 mumol/L to 173 mumol/L, but decreased to 152 mumol/L when indomethacin was decreased to 75 mg q.d.; urinary output remained stable around 2 L/day. The literature described 22 patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (16 congenital, 6 lithium) treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Urine flow was reduced to 1/3, within hours. Rarely, mild renal failure ensued, improving in all but one case when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were reduced. Indomethacin (and controlled volume reduction if continued high urine output), while observing renal function, appears the emergency treatment of choice for serious complications of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Depressive symptoms were measured in 34 white male patients receiving propranolol treatment for cardiovascular illness. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Hudson Generalized Contentment Scale were used to measure depressive symptoms. Patients with a positive personal or family history of depression had significantly higher depression scores than those with a negative history. Although there was no correlation between propranolol dosage and depressive symptoms for the population as a whole, among patients with a negative history there was a highly significant positive correlation between propranolol dosage and depression scores.
Doxorubicin (DOX) has been used in a variety of human malignancies for decades, in particular of lymphoma. But increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been implicated in its cardiotoxicity. Resveratrol (RES) generates cardiovascular protective effects by heme oxygenase-1(HO-1)-mediated mechanism. The present study was designed to determine whether RES protected cardiomyocyte against apoptosis through induction of HO-1 in lymphoma nude mouse in vivo. After being developed into lymphoma model, 40 male Balb/c nude mice were randomized to one of the following four treatments (10 mice per group): control, DOX, DOX + RES and DOX + RES + HO-1 inhibitor (zinc protoporphyrin IX, ZnPP). The results showed that DOX injection markedly decreased the body weight, the heart weight and the ratio of heart weight to body weight, but inversely increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the level of serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Moreover, DOX injection attenuated HO-1 expression and enzymatic activity as well as increased P53 expression, modulated Bcl-2/Bax expression and enhanced caspase 3 activity. These cardiotoxic effects of DOX were ameliorated by its combination with RES. However, the protective effects of RES were reversed by the addition of ZnPP. Taken together, it is concluded that HO-1 plays a core role for protective action of RES in DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in lymphoma nude mice.
Clozapine is a novel antipsychotic agent effective in treating refractory schizophrenia. Clozapine produces fewer extrapyramidal effects than other neuroleptics, although agranulocytosis and seizures are significant adverse effects. To characterize the spectrum of clozapine-related electroencephalographic abnormalities, we identified 10 patients who had electroencephalograms (EEGs) performed before and during clozapine treatment. These 10 patients represented a subset of individuals participating in an investigational trial. During clozapine treatment, five developed myoclonus and one experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Records were retrospectively reviewed by an electroencephalographer blinded to the patient's history and medications. All patients had normal EEGs before clozapine treatment. While receiving clozapine (250-900 mg daily), all patients developed background slowing in the theta and often delta ranges. Additionally, 7 patients exhibited bilateral spike, polyspike and slow wave discharges, one with a photoparoxysmal response. Follow-up EEGs performed in 4 of these 7 patients after a decrease in clozapine dosage and/or addition in valproic acid showed diminished epileptiform activity.
In the dopamine-depleted striatum, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is implicated in the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. To gain insights on its role in this disorder, we examined the effects of L-DOPA on the state of phosphorylation of ERK and downstream target proteins in striatopallidal and striatonigral medium spiny neurons (MSNs). For this purpose, we employed mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the promoters for the dopamine D(2) receptor (Drd2-EGFP mice) or the dopamine D(1) receptor (Drd1a-EGFP mice), which are expressed in striatopallidal and striatonigral MSNs, respectively. In 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned Drd2-EGFP mice, L-DOPA increased the phosphorylation of ERK, mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 and histone H3, selectively in EGFP-negative MSNs. Conversely, a complete co-localization between EGFP and these phosphoproteins was observed in Drd1a-EGFP mice. The effect of L-DOPA was prevented by blockade of dopamine D(1) receptors. The same pattern of activation of ERK signaling was observed in dyskinetic mice, after repeated administration of L-DOPA. Our results demonstrate that in the dopamine-depleted striatum, L-DOPA activates ERK signaling specifically in striatonigral MSNs. This regulation may result in ERK-dependent changes in striatal plasticity leading to dyskinesia.
The use of topical tretinoin (Retin-A) for comedonal lesions, benzoyl peroxide for inflamed papules and pustules, and topical or oral antibiotics for more severe or widespread disease gives excellent results for the majority of patients with acne. At present, oral isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) (Accutane) should be reserved for patients with severe nodulocystic acne whose condition has not responded to an accepted therapeutic regimen. Good patient rapport and follow-up are essential in the management of this common disease.
The anticonvulsant activity of competitive 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo (F)-quinoxaline (NBQX) and noncompetitive 2,3-benzodiazepines and tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists, was tested in different experimental seizure models and compared with diazepam, a conventional antiepileptic drug acting on GABAergic neurotransmission. In particular, the compounds were evaluated against audiogenic and maximal electroshock seizures (MES) test and pentetrazol (PTZ) seizures model, and all of them showed protective action. In addition, NBQX, 2,3-benzodiazepines and THIQs, but not diazepam, were also protective against clonic and tonic seizures and lethality induced by kainate, AMPA and ATPA, but were ineffective against NMDA-induced seizures. Only 2,3-benzodiazepines and some THIQs were able to affect 4-aminopyridine- and mercaptopropionic-acid-induced seizures. The duration of anticonvulsant action of 33 micromol/kg of some 2,3-benzodiazepines and THIQs was also investigated in DBA/2 mice, a strain genetically susceptible to audiogenic seizures, and it was observed that the derivative THIQ-10c, possessing an acetyl group at the N-2 and a chlorine atom on the C-1 phenyl ring, showed higher anticonvulsant activity and longer-lasting protective effects.
McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations of XK, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function. Originally defined as a peculiar Kell blood group variant, the disease affects multiple organs, including the nervous system, but is certainly underdiagnosed. We analyzed the mutations and clinical findings of 22 affected men, aged 27 to 72 years. Fifteen different XK mutations were found, nine of which were novel, including the one of the eponymous case McLeod. Their common result is predicted absence or truncation of the XK protein. All patients showed elevated levels of muscle creatine phosphokinase, but clinical myopathy was less common. A peripheral neuropathy with areflexia was found in all but 2 patients. The central nervous system was affected in 15 patients, as obvious from the occurrence of seizures, cognitive impairment, psychopathology, and choreatic movements. Neuroimaging emphasized the particular involvement of the basal ganglia, which was also detected in 1 asymptomatic young patient. Most features develop with age, mainly after the fourth decade. The resemblance of McLeod syndrome with Huntington's disease and with autosomal recessive chorea-acanthocytosis suggests that the corresponding proteins--XK, huntingtin, and chorein--might belong to a common pathway, the dysfunction of which causes degeneration of the basal ganglia.
Five patients with hypertension died as a result of myocarditis. Three were treated with methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide, two with methyldopa alone. Their ages ranged from 30 to 71 years. In all instances death occurred suddenly, and myocarditis was not suspected clinically. The inflammatory changes in the hearts of these patients were most consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction. Additionally, there was hepatitis consistent with hypersensitivity in four of the cases.
Chronic lead exposure causes a variety of impairments in learning and memory and cognitive function. Synaptic plasticity in hippocampus is an extensively studied cellular model of learning and memory, which includes long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in two forms. Depotentiation (DP) is another form of synaptic plasticity. Previous studies show that chronic lead exposure can damage the induction of LTP/LTD in hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) areas. In the present study, we investigated the repair and protection on lead-caused synaptic plasticity impairment by galantamine, using field potential recording on chronic lead exposure rats. The results showed that chronic lead exposure impaired LTP/DP induction in DG area of the hippocampus, and galantamine caused a significant increase on the amplitudes of LTP/DP of lead-exposed rats, but only a small increase in non-exposed group. These results suggest that galantamine could reverse the lead-induced impairments of synaptic plasticity in rats and might be an effective medicine to cure the cognitive deficits induced by lead.
Two experiments examined the effects of methylphenidate in male and female patients enrolled in an outpatient treatment program for primary cocaine dependence. The first study was a component of a double-blind efficacy trial wherein 57 patients were first tested in a human laboratory for their initial responsiveness to medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or methylphenidate treatment and received their first dose in the human laboratory environment before continuing in outpatient treatment. Methylphenidate was given as a 20-mg sustained-release dose (twice daily) plus an additional 5-mg immediate-release dose combined with the morning dose. Methylphenidate increased heart rate and subjective ratings; however, the subjective effects were primarily of a "dysphoric" nature, and significant effects were limited to increases in anxiety, depression, and anger on the Profile of Mood States; shaky/jittery ratings on a visual analog scale; and dysphoria on the lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) scale of the Addiction Research Center Inventory. Methylphenidate did not increase cocaine craving nor ratings suggesting abuse potential (i.e., Morphine-Benzedrine Group or drug-liking scores, etc.). None of the drug effects observed in the human laboratory was of clinical concern, and no subject was precluded from continuing in the outpatient study. After outpatient treatment completion, 12 patients were brought back into a second double-blind human laboratory study in which three doses (15, 30, and 60 mg) of immediate-release methylphenidate were administered in an ascending series preceded and followed by placebo. Methylphenidate produced dose-related increases in heart rate, subjective ratings of shaky/jittery, and LSD/dysphoria without significantly altering cocaine craving or stimulant euphoria ratings. These results suggest that stimulant substitution-type approaches to the treatment of cocaine dependence are not necessarily contraindicated because of cardiovascular toxicity or medication abuse potential. However, they also suggest that the subjective effects of methylphenidate may not be positive enough for an adequate replacement approach.
1,3-β-Glucan was a major cell wall component of fungus. The existing studies showed that 1,3-β-glucan exposure could induce lung inflammation that involved both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) played a critical role in regulating immune homeostasis by adjusting the Th1/Th2 balance. The role of Treg cells and regulatory mechanism in 1,3-β-glucan-induced lung inflammation is still unclear. In our study, mice were exposed to 1,3-β-glucan by intratracheal instillation. To investigate the role of Treg cells in response to 1,3-β-glucan, we generated Treg-depleted mice by intraperitoneal administration of anti-CD25 mAb. The Treg-depleted mice showed more inflammatory cells and severer pathological inflammatory change in lung tissue. Depletion of Treg cells led to increased Th1 cytokines and decreased Th2 cytokines. Treg-depleted mice showed a decreased expression of anti-inflammation cytokine and lower-level expression of CTLA-4. In all, our study indicated that Treg cells participated in regulating the 1,3-β-glucan-induced lung inflammation. Depletion of Treg cells aggravated the 1,3-β-glucan-induced lung inflammation, regulated the Th1/Th2 balance by enhancing Th1 response. Treg cells exerted their modulation function depending on both direct and indirect mechanism during the 1,3-β-glucan-induced lung inflammation.
The ultimate goal of treatment is suppression of viral replication to undetectable HBV-DNA levels prior to and after liver transplantation (LT) to prevent infection of the newly transplanted liver. Most published data are available from therapy with lamivudine (LAM) in pre- and post-transplant HBV patients. Add-on therapy with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) in pre-transplant LAM-resistant patients has been shown to represent an effective antiviral strategy leading to hepatic recompensation in many cases and, eventually, removal from the waiting list. Newer nucleos(t)ide analogues such as entecavir, tenofovir and telbivudine have shown lower resistance rates than LAM and more antiviral potency in studies in the non-transplant setting. Combined hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy have been widely adopted as the most effective treatment strategy against recurrent HBV disease after LT. Many programs have evaluated lower doses or a shorter duration of HBIG and intramuscular versus intravenous routes of administration. Active immunisation using recombinant HBV vaccines, including the S, pre-S1 and pre-S2 regions, and those with immunostimulatory adjuvants, seem to be more immunogenic than the currently available vaccines and have been used in studies to replace HBIG. Furthermore, it has been shown that immune memory against HBV can be adoptively transferred from organ donors to transplant recipients. Nucleos(t)ide analogue combination therapies might provide an alternative to the current treatment paradigm with costly HBIG; however, experience with this new treatment regimen is very limited and controlled clinical studies are urgently warranted to investigate its safety and efficacy and to determine which nucleos(t)ide analogue combinations will be the most promising in the long term after LT.
To determine if the uncorrected QT interval (QT(u)) more accurately predicts drug-induced torsade de pointes than QT intervals corrected using the Bazett's (QT(B)), Fridericia (QT(Frid)), or Framingham (QT(Fram)) methods.
Retrospective analysis of a previously reported case-control study of risk factors for haloperidol-induced torsade de pointes.
Large tertiary care teaching hospital.
Forty-six critically ill patients who received intravenous haloperidol for sedation; seven developed torsade de pointes.
The QT intervals were measured manually by one investigator from electrocardiograms performed before and during haloperidol therapy. Logistic regression analysis for prediction of torsade de pointes was performed, incorporating QT(u), QT(B), QT(Frid), QT(Fram), and RR intervals measured during treatment. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed. Primary outcome measures were proportion of explained variation (maximum-rescaled R2); area under the ROC curves for QT(u), QT(B), QT(Frid), QT(Fram), and RR interval; and sensitivity and specificity for prediction of haloperidol-induced torsade de pointes. The QT(u) was associated with the highest R2 compared with QT(Fram), QT(Frid), QT(B), and RR interval (0.77, 0.73, 0.68, 0.53, and 0.30, respectively). No significant differences in areas under the ROC curves were found between any of the QT-interval methods. Areas under the ROC curves for QT(u) and QT(Fram) trended toward being greater than that associated with the RR interval. All QT-interval methods were highly sensitive (100% for each), whereas the RR interval was less sensitive (86%); QT(u) and QT(Fram) were most specific (82%) compared with the QT(Frid) (72%), QT(B) (64%), and RR interval (36%).
Compared with QT(B) and QT(Frid), the QT(u) and QT(Fram) best predicted haloperidol-induced torsade de pointes in critically ill patients; the QT(Fram) offered no advantage over the QT(u).
