To determine whether cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1 receptor) is involved in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic injury in the mouse brain.
Brain injury was induced by NMDA microinjection (50-150 nmol in 0.5 microL) into the cerebral cortex. The changes in CysLT1 receptor expression 24 h after NMDA injection and the effects of a CysLT1 receptor antagonist, pranlukast (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg), an NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine (30 mg/kg), and an antioxidant, edaravone (9 mg/kg) were observed.
In the NMDA-injured brain, the CysLT1 receptor mRNA, and protein expression were upregulated, and the receptor was mainly localized in the neurons and not in the astrocytes. Pranlukast, ketamine and edaravone decreased NMDA-induced injury; pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg) and ketamine inhibited the upregulated expression of the CysLT1 receptor.
CysLT1 receptor expression in neurons is upregulated after NMDA injection, and NMDA-induced responses are inhibited by CysLT1 receptor antagonists, indicating that the increased CysLT1 receptor is involved in NMDA excitotoxicity.
The objective of this study was to evaluate basic behavioural phenotypes and methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity in dopamine transporter (DAT) knockdown and control mice after local injections of small interference RNA into ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra once every other day for 14 days. Local knockdown of DAT expression in the mouse brain did not affect basic behavioural functions, but these mice displayed elevated depression-like immobility and a approximately 35% reduction of methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity.
Infiltrating transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder were induced by ingestion of 0.188% N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl] formamide (FANFT) in 145 female Wistar rats. After 8 months of carcinogen exposure, the animals were divided into different treatment groups. They received cyclophosphamide intraperitoneally as a single injection or BCG either once intralesionally or weekly subcutaneously or a combination of cyclophosphamide followed by subcutaneous BCG. The treatment effect was determined by body weight measurements and bladder tumour weight after 12 months. Compared with a control group statistically significant differences of bladder tumour weights were found after treatment with BCG alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide. Intralesional BCG resulted in an insignificant increase of tumour weights.
We investigated the influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril on cardiac arrhythmias in guinea pigs and rats. Ramiprilat, the active moiety of ramipril, did not influence action potentials of isolated guinea-pig papillary muscle or rabbit sinus node, thereby excluding cellular electrophysiological evidence of anti-arrhythmic properties. Ramipril protected against cardiac arrhythmias induced by digoxin infusion in guinea pigs. This effect was comparable with that of lidocaine. In isolated perfused ischemic working rat hearts, angiotensin (ANG) I (3 x 10(-9) M/l) and ANG II (1 x 10(-9) M/l) aggravated reperfusion arrhythmias, accompanied by deterioration of cardiodynamic and metabolic events. Bradykinin (BK) (1 x 10(-10)-1 x 10(-8) M/l), in contrast, protected against reperfusion arrhythmias, which corresponded to an increase in energy-rich phosphates and glycogen stores and a decrease in lactate levels in myocardial tissue. Identical changes were seen in hearts from rats pretreated with ramipril (1 mg/kg PO) or perfused with ramiprilat (2.58 x 10(-7)-2.58 x 10(-5) M/l). Local ACE inhibition in these ischemic hearts antagonized ANG I but not ANG II effects and enhanced BK effects. The BK antagonist D-Arg-(Hyp2, Thi5,8, D-Phe7)BK abolished the beneficial effects of BK, ramipril, and ramiprilat. Increased concentrations of BK or ramiprilat were able to reverse the antagonism. The antiarrhythmic agent nicainoprol, a fast-sodium-channel blocking drug (class Ib), also protected isolated rat hearts against reperfusion arrhythmias, but was without beneficial effects on cardiac hemodynamics and biochemical parameters, in contrast to the ACE inhibitor. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril on digoxin and reperfusion arrhythmias are not mediated by their direct actions on ionic channels in the cell membrane. It seems that other factors are responsible for its beneficial effects on reperfusion arrhythmias, cardiac function, and metabolism, which are associated with a reduction in ANG II generation and BK degradation by local ACE inhibition in the heart.
The spate of medicolegal inquiries following the disqualification of Parlodel (bromocriptine mesylate) by the Food and Drug Administration for postpartum ablactation, uncovered previously unreported side effects associated with its postpartum administration. In 1994, bromocriptine mesylate was withdrawn from the market as a milk suppressant. Since this time, over a dozen cases of postpartum intracranial hemorrhages associated with its use have been reported. We describe three additional cases of postpartum intracranial hemorrhage related to bromocriptine usage. One patient, previously normotensive, developed hypertension and a headache; initial CT was normal, but CT 24 h later demonstrated intracranial hemorrhage. This suggests that the blood-pressure elevation was drug-induced and was the cause, rather than the consequence, of bromocriptine-related intracranial hemorrhage.
Isoniazid and pyrazinamide are both well-known hepatotoxic drugs. When isoniazid is used, the hepatic lesion appears before than when pyrazinamide is used. This paper intends to relate a case of a 5-month-old patient who had lungs' and meningeal tuberculosis and who developed toxic hepatitis accomplished by hepatic failure while he was being treated with isoniazid, pyrazinamide and rifampicin. The clinic manifestations and the laboratory alterations were detected in the fifth day of treatment and the recovery was fast; and almost complete by the end of the first week, in which the use of isoniazid had been suspended. Although it was necessary to take the patient to the intensive care unit, he had a good recovery, without sequels.
In order to observe the reaction of cochlear blood flow (CBF) to trimetaphan (TMP)-induced hypotension, CBF was measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry in 7 human subjects during general anaesthesia for middle ear surgery. All subjects showed a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) during intravenous infusion of TMP, followed by a gradual return to the baseline level after termination of the infusion. The CBF generally followed the MAP changes with the same pattern. Three of the seven subjects demonstrated a CBF change larger than the maximum MAP change, indicating the lack of a local autoregulatory mechanism in CBF. On the other hand, CBF changes were smaller in magnitude than the maximum change in MAP for the rest of the subjects, suggesting an autoregulatory mechanism in CBF. However, since the audiograms from these subjects indicated profound damage along the cochlear basal turn probably due to middle ear inflammation, concomitant vascular damage in this region offers another possible explanation for the inappropriate CBF changes. The present observations may also suggest that deliberately TMP-induced hypotension has a potentially harmful effect on CBF during otological surgery that attempts to preserve or improve hearing.
In the rat, behavioral changes during lactation are in several ways similar to those produced by benzodiazepines (BDZ). Moreover, an increased activity at the GABA/BDZ receptor complex has been found in both conditions. We tested the hypothesis that early manipulation of this neurochemical system by prenatal BDZ exposure should affect typical responses of lactating dams, such as maternal aggression. Outbred CD-1 mice were treated with either oxazepam (15 mg/kg PO twice/day on days 12-16 of fetal life) or vehicle and fostered at birth to untreated dams. Female offspring were subsequently mated at the young-adult stage and used to assess maternal aggressive responses towards a male intruder. In a first 5-min test on postpartum day 6, the prenatal oxazepam animals showed a reduced Latency to the First Attack, a markedly enhanced frequency of several offensive scores (such as Fighting Episodes, Attacks, and Offensive Upright, On Top, and Kicking Postures), a decrease of Submissive Postures and a reduced duration of time spent lying still (Out of the Nest). The tests were repeated 48 h later after IP treatment by either chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) or saline. The drug significantly enhanced locomotor activity as well as the frequency of Fighting Episodes and of Attacks, while decreasing the number of Submissive Postures and the time spent On Nest. These effects were not significantly modified by prenatal oxazepam exposure. This suggests that long-term and acute effects of benzodiazepines are produced either by changes in different regulatory systems or by different types of changes in the same system.
Craniometaphysial dysplasia (CMD) is a rare disorder that mainly affects craniofacial bones. It is caused by mutations within a region of human homolog (Ankh) of the mouse progressive ankylosis (Ank) gene. ANK, together with other factors, regulates intracellular and extracellular levels of pyrophosphate/inorganic phosphate critical for maintaining mineral homeostasis. The systemic manifestations noted in CMD patients have been reported previously. The dental anomalies in CMD patients, however, have been minimally described in the dental literature. The purpose of this case report was to describe both systemic and dental manifestations of a 3 1/2-year-old child with craniometaphysial dysplasia. At the gross level, enamel discoloration and tooth malformations were observed in multiple primary teeth without obvious defects in the roots. Radiographic evidence of excess mineralization was noted on the primary maxillary second molars, limited to the mesial region of the crowns. The genetic and molecular effects of Ank/Ankh mutations are also discussed.
Dopamine and norepinephrine are neurotransmitters which participate in various regulatory functions of the human brain. These functions are lost in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we used SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells to investigate the cytotoxicities of high concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine on neuronal cells. Dopamine, norepinephrine, as well as their corresponding synthetic agonists (SKF38393 and isoproterenol, respectively) triggered SK-N-MC cell death when applied at 50-100 muM persistently for 2 days. This catecholamine-induced cell death appears to be neuronal specific, as demonstrated by their inabilities of triggering apoptosis of A549 lung carcinoma cells and Cos-7 kidney fibroblasts. By pretreating SK-N-MC cells with target-specific inhibitors before administration of catecholamine, components of G protein signaling (i.e. G( s )/cAMP/PKA), monoamine oxidases, nitric oxide synthase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and oxidative stress were found to be involved in this dopamine/norepinephrine-induced cytotoxicity, which subsequently led to caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic responses as well as DNA degradation. In contrast, agonists of G( i )-coupled dopamine receptors and adrenergic receptors (quinpirole and UK14,304, respectively) were incapable of triggering apoptosis of SK-N-MC cells. Our results suggest that both G protein (G( s ))-mediated signaling cascade and oxidative stress participate in the dopamine/norepinephrine-induced neuronal apoptosis.
Cocaine is a worldwide used drug and its abuse is associated with physical, psychiatric and social problems. The mechanism by which cocaine causes neurological damage is very complex and involves several neurotransmitter systems. For example, cocaine increases extracellular levels of dopamine and free radicals, and modulates several transcription factors. NF-kappaB is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression involved in cellular death. Our aim was to investigate the toxicity and modulation of NF-kappaB activity by cocaine in PC 12 cells. Treatment with cocaine (1 mM) for 24 hours induced DNA fragmentation, cellular membrane rupture and reduction of mitochondrial activity. A decrease in Bcl-2 protein and mRNA levels, and an increase in caspase 3 activity and cleavage were also observed. In addition, cocaine (after 6 hours treatment) activated the p50/p65 subunit of NF-kappaB complex and the pretreatment of the cells with SCH 23390, a D1 receptor antagonist, attenuated the NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by using PDTC and Sodium Salicilate increased cell death caused by cocaine. These results suggest that cocaine induces cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) and activates NF-kappaB in PC12 cells. This activation occurs, at least partially, due to activation of D1 receptors and seems to have an anti-apoptotic effect on these cells.
We report the occurrence of sinus arrest and asystole due to severe lithium intoxication in a patient with preexisting conduction tissue disease. Lithium should be used with extreme caution and frequent monitoring in patients with conduction tissue disease.
The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between methylation and loss of hMLH1 and hMSH2 expression in ovarian cancer.
We examined the methylation status of hMLH1 and hMSH2 promoter region by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in 56 primary ovarian cancer tissues and 20 normal ovarian tissues, the relationship between the methylation status of these two genes and clinicopathological characteristics were analysed. We then treated SKOV3 and 3AO ovarian cancer cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dc). The hMLH1 and hMSH2 methylation was further assessed by MSP, and their mRNA expression was compared by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) before and after 5-aza-dc treatment in these two cell lines.
The methylation frequency of hMLH1 and hMSH2 was 30.4% (17 of 56) and 51.7% (29 of 56) in ovarian cancers, respectively, while no methylation was detected in normal ovarian tissues (P=0.015). There is a significant correlation between hMLH1 promoter hypermethylation and histological grade (P=0.028) as well as lymphatic metastasis (P=0.003). Methylation of hMSH2 correlated with histological grade (P=0.035) and lymphatic metastasis (P=0.015). Besides, the methylation rates of hMSH2 were significantly higher in endometrioid adenocarcinoma tissues than in other pathological types of ovarian cancer. After 5-aza-dc treatment, the expression of hMLH1 and hMSH2 was reversed in two cell lines.
Our results indicate that promoter hypermethylation is an important mechanism for loss of hMLH1 and hMSH2 expression in human ovarian cancer and may be a potential prognostic factor in ovarian cancer.
Endothelial dysfunction often precedes Type 2 diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications. One important cause of endothelial dysfunction is oxidative stress, which can lead to reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. In this study, we examined the effects of ramipril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ACEI) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and endothelium-dependent vasodilation using a Type 2 diabetic (db/db) murine model. Plasma concentration of 8-isoprostane ([8-isoP]) was measured and used as an indication of the amount of ROS production. Six weeks of ramipril (10 mg/kg/day) treatment significantly reduced [8-isoP] and improved acetylcholine(ACh)-induced vasodilation in db/db mice without altering responses in wild-type (WT) mice. Responsiveness of smooth muscle cells to NO, assessed by sodium nitroprusside-induced vasodilation, was not different between db/db and WT mice regardless of ramipril or vehicle treatment. Our results suggest that ramipril specifically improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in Type 2 diabetic mice, possibly by reducing ROS levels.
Amifostine has emerged as a pancytoprotectant shown protection against nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and ototoxicity in preclinical studies.
We designed a prospective comparative randomized trial to evaluate the cytoprotective effects of amifostine in patients with osteosarcoma receiving cisplatin and doxorrubicin. Patients were evaluated for renal, hearing and cardiac toxicity.
We included 28 patients, mean age was 11.6 years, five had metastatic disease. Fifteen patients received amifostine and 13 did not. 20% of patients receiving amifostine developed renal toxicity compared to 30% in the control group (p = 0.318). Grade 1 and 2 audiologic toxicity was present in 100% of the experimental group against 85% of the controls (p = 0.501). Grade 1 cardiac toxicity was present in 2 patients in the control group (p = 0.175). There were no statistical significant differences between the two groups for chemotherapy-related toxicity. Response to chemotherapy was significantly better in the amifostine group.
amifostine did not reduce the ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity of our treatment regime. It was not well tolerated due to emesis. It is a selective cytoprotectant without reducing the effect of chemotherapy.
We report a case of amiodarone induced torsades de pointes (TdP) associated with increase QT dispersion in a patient with a history of quinidine induced TdP. An increase in QT dispersion of > 100% was noted on the 12 lead surface ECG postamiodarone therapy. In summary, amiodarone has a potential to induce TdP in patients with a previous history of quinidine induced TdP. QT dispersion could be a potential marker of TdP in these patients.
The aim of the our study was to investigate the role of adenosine receptors on cardiovascular toxicity induced by amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant agent. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study was that adenosine receptor antagonists would improve and/or prevent amitriptyline-induced hypotension and conduction abnormalities in an anesthetized rat model of amitriptyline intoxication.
Two separate experimental protocols were performed. Amitriptyline intoxication was induced by the infusion of amitriptyline 0.94 mg/kg/min until 40-45% reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP). Sodium cromoglycate (10 mg/kg) was injected i.v. to inhibit the A3 receptor-mediated activation of mast cells. In protocol 1, after amitriptyline infusion, while control animals (n=8) were given dextrose solution, treatment groups received a selective adenosine A1 antagonist DPCPX (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-Dipropylxanthine, 20 microg/kg/min, n=8) or a selective A2a antagonist CSC (8-(3-chlorostyryl) caffeine, 24 microg/kg/min, n=8) for 60 minutes. In protocol 2, after the sodium cromoglycate, while control group of rats (n=8) recevied a dextrose solution, treatment groups of rats were administered DPCPX (20 microg/kg/min, n=8) or CSC (24 microg/kg/min, n=8) infusion to block adenosine A1 and A2a receptors for 20 minutes before amitriptyline infusion. After pretreatment with adenosine antagonists, all rats were given a dose of 0.94 mg/kg/min of amitriptyline infusion during 60 minutes. Outcome measures were mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), QRS duration and survival rate.
In protocol 1, amitriptyline infusion significantly reduced MAP and prolonged QRS within 15 minutes. HR was not changed significantly during the experiments. While dextrose did not improve MAP and QRS prolongation, DPCPX or CSC administration developed a significant improvement in MAP compared to the dextrose group within 10 min (88.5 +/- 2.8%, 75.6 +/- 4.7% and 50.1 +/- 14.7%, p<0.01, p<0.05, respectively). Both DPCPX and CSC decreased QRS prolongation (p<0.05) and increased median survival time significantly (log-rank test, p<0.00001). In protocol 2, pretreatment with DPCPX or CSC prevented the reduction in MAP due to amitriptyline toxicity compared to rats administered dextrose infusion (99.5 +/- 2.6%, 102.4 +/- 2.6%, 81.8 +/- 5.4, p<0.01 at 30 min; 98.0 +/- 2.9%, 93.5 +/- 6.0%, 64.9 +/- 4.7, p<0.001, p<0.01 at 40 min, respectively). Pretreatment with DPCPX or CSC also prevented the QRS prolongation (p<0.05) and increased median survival time significantly (log-rank test, p<0.0001).
Adenosine antagonists were found to be effective in improving hypotension, QRS prolongation and survival time in our rat model of amitriptyline toxicity. Additionally, amitriptyline-induced cardiotoxicity was abolished by pretreatment with adenosine receptor antagonists. These results suggest that adenosine receptors may have a role in the pathophysiology of amitriptyline-induced cardiovascular toxicity. Adenosine A1 and A2a receptor antagonists may be promising agents for reversing amitriptyline-induced cardiovascular toxicity.
Somatomotor cortex of mice with microcephaly induced by DNA polymerase inhibitor cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), has been studied with a modified Golgi-Cox staining and a HRP retrograde tracing method. Microcephalic mice were prepared by prenatal injections of cytosine arabinoside on days 13.5 and 14.5 of pregnancy. Cytoarchitectonically, the cerebral cortices of adult microcephalic mice are characterized by atypical pyramidal cells with abnormal dendrites and irregular patterns of cellular lamination. Semiquantitative analyses of the abnormality of dendrites in Golgi-Cox preparation indicate that both the degree and direction of ramification are severely affected in Ara-C treated mice. In adult control cerebrum, original neurons of corticospinal tract labeled after HRP injection into the lumbar cord were situated in layer V. In the microcephalic brains, however, HRP labeled neurons, some of which had abnormal polarity, were scattered throughout all layers. This HRP study for corticospinal tract neurons also confirms the irregular pattern of the cortex in which only three layers are recognized.
A 14-year-old boy survived for 7 years after the initial diagnosis and treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia. Neurologic deterioration occured repeatedly throughout his complicated clinical course but it was most severe and only partially reversible following orally administered pyrimethamine. The neuropathologic lesions were distinctive and included a diffuse reactive astrocytosis, axonal degeneration, status spongiosis, circumscribed foci of demyelination and coagulative necrosis, and mural thickening with luminal narrowing of microcirculatory vessels. This collection of findings represents the leukoencephalopathy of childhood leukemia that we and others believe results in large part from the combined effects of cranial irradiation and chemotherapy. The role of folic acid antagonists, namely methotrexate and pyrimethamine, are particularly noteworthy in this regard.
Mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) causes acute oxidant renal failure that affects mainly proximal tubules. Schisandrin B (Sch B), an active lignan from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis, has been successfully used to treat gentamicin nephrotoxicity, but its role against mercury damage is still largely unknown. Here we analysed in vivo and in vitro the efficacy of Sch B supplementation against HgCl₂ nephrotoxicity, focusing on histopathology, stress proteins, oxidative (cytochrome c oxidase) and nitrosactive markers (eNOS, nNOS). Wistar rats were treated with Sch B (10 mg/kg/day p.o.) or vehicle (olive oil) for 9 days, then coadministered with a single HgCl₂ nephrotoxic dose (3.5 mg/kg i.p.) and killed after 24 h. The tubular and mitochondrial damage induced by mercury was limited by Sch B coadministration in vivo. Remarkably, after Sch B and mercury challenge, HSP25, HSP72, GRP75 were reduced in the renal cortex, cytochrome c oxidase increased and eNOS and nNOS were restored in glomeruli. In contrast, NRK-52E proximal tubular cells treated with Sch B 6.25 μM plus HgCl₂ 20 μM did not show any amelioration on viability and oxidative stress in respect to HgCl₂ 20 μM alone. Moreover, after Sch B plus mercury in vitro treatment, HSP72 staining persisted while HSP25 further increased. Thus, in our experimental conditions, Sch B cotreatment afforded better protection against mercury poisoning in vivo than in vitro. This discrepancy might be partly attributable to Sch B influence on glomerular perfusion as corroborated by the recovery of vasoactive markers like macular and endothelial nitric oxide isoforms.
Forty-one consecutive children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) received prophylaxis therapy with the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin during L-asparaginase treatment. Enoxaparin was given every 24 h subcutaneously at a median dose of 0.84 mg/kg per day (range, 0.45-1.33 mg/kg per day) starting at the first dose of L-asparaginase until 1 week after the last dose. Molecular analysis for thrombophilic polymorphisms documented prothrombin G20210A mutation in 3/27 (11%), homozygosity for MTHFR C677T mutation in 5/27 (18.5%, and heterozygosity for factor V Leiden mutation in 5/27 (18.5%) children. There were no thrombotic events during 76 courses of L-asparaginase in 41 patients who had received enoxaparin. One patient suffered brain infarct 7 days after enoxaparin was stopped. There were no bleeding episodes. In a historical control group of 50 ALL children who had not received prophylactic enoxaparin during L-asparaginase treatment, two had thromboembolisms (one deep vein thrombosis and one pulmonary embolism). Enoxaparin is safe and seems to be effective in prevention of thromboembolism in ALL patients during L-asparaginase therapy. This study provides pilot data for a future randomized trial of the use of LMWH during ALL therapy for the prevention of asparaginase-associated thrombotic events.
A case is reported in which catatonia and autonomic abnormalities occurred in a patient on long-term fluphenazine decanoate following overdose with an oral anorectic agent containing phenylpropanolamine and caffeine. The catatonic symptoms showed a rapid and complete resolution following intramuscular benztropine. A possible mechanism to explain the catatonic symptoms is discussed.
Direct hepatic arterial infusion of floxuridine (FUDR) (Roche Laboratories, Division of Hoffman-LaRoche Inc., Nutley, NJ, U.S.A.) has been used extensively in the treatment of metastases of colorectal tumors to the liver. The effectiveness of infusion and tolerance of the chemotherapy has been improved utilizing a totally implantable infusion pump delivery system. However, unequal distribution of drug infusion may occur to different parts of the liver parenchyma as demonstrated by hepatic arterial infusion scintigraphy (HAPS). We present a case of such unequal perfusion in which fatty metamorphosis of the liver occurred in the overperfused liver segment after FUDR therapy. The liver parenchymal changes were followed by serial computerized tomography scans and proven by biopsy during a minilaparotomy. Serial HAPS examinations show redirection of subsequent infusion to the opposite liver lobe due to parenchymal damage and vascular sclerosis. The importance of uniform liver perfusion and a rare dose-related effect of FUDR on liver parenchyma are thereby demonstrated.
The clinical experiment was designed for observing the effects of deliberate hypotension at different level on cerebral blood flow and metabolism.
30 ASA Grade I-II patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups (each group n = 10). Hypotension was induced by sodium nitroprusside in group 1[mean arterial pressure (MAP) = 55 mmHg] and group 2 (MAP = 65 mmHg). Group 3 (control) was on normotension. The changes of cerebral blood flow during hypotension were estimated according to the variability of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the middle cerebral artery(MCA), which was obtained through transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD).
Hypotension caused a moderate decrease in CBFV, but no significant difference, in CBFV and oxygen saturation in internal jugular vein(SjO2), either among three groups or during the procedure.
It is safe for cerebral perfusion and metabolism with deliberate hypotension at MAP = 55 mmHg.
The patient who presents for evaluation and/or subsequent treatment of a neurological or psychiatric complaint accompanied by a positive history of substance abuse has generally received only modest attention in the clinical practice literature. Significantly more clinical attention has focused on the neurobehavioral sequelae of more pronounced brain insults, despite the rapid emergence of literature detailing psychopharmacologic-induced changes in brain-behavior functioning. This article describes recent clinical research findings related to the neuropsychology of cocaine use and associated issues of neurobiology and psychopharmacology. A description of strategies that have proven effective for assessing this population will be discussed. An emphasis on neurocognitive impairment that may precede as well as occur consequent to cocaine use are also examined. The literature reviewed here generally supports the conclusion that subgroups of cocaine abusing patients may demonstrate sustained brain perfusion anomalies and persistent neurocognitive deficits.
