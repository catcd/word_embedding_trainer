Studies were carried out in rats on the effects of the administration of delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) and its analogs (1-4) into the reticular part of the substantia nigra on movement and convulsive activity. Intranigral microinjection of DSIP, and of DSIP-1 and DSIP-4, reduced horizontal and vertical movement activity as well as excursions to the center of the open field. DSIP, DSIP-2, and DSIP-3 had anticonvulsant effects, consisting of increases in the latent periods of the first convulsion and clonicotonic convulsions induced by picrotoxin, and reductions in the mean intensity of convulsions. It is suggested that changes in the structure of DSIP are accompanied by alterations in the strength of the effects of this peptide on horizontal and convulsive activity after dosage into the reticular part of the substantia nigra. The results indicating that these peptides have protective activity in experimental convulsive syndrome suggest that a relationship exists between DSIP-induced reductions in movement activity and the anticonvulsive efficacy of DSIP analogs when administered intranigrally, this being one of the components of the nigrodependent mechanisms of inhibition of convulsions.
Drop attacks represent a significant problem during the natural course of Meniere's disease. They are characterized by a sudden fall to the ground without loss of consciousness. Diagnosis is clinical and based on the typical description of the patient. Involvement of vertical canal is possible during Meniere's disease and also after gentamicin application. Treatment of drop attacks is still a matter of discussion; most cases have a benign course with spontaneous remission and no treatment is necessary. In severe cases, aggressive treatment (surgical or pharmacological) is necessary. A case of drop attack associated with vertical vertigo is presented. Vestibular tests were performed in order to assess the involvement of inner ear. Caloric test and ice water test reveal no response. Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials are present even after high doses of gentamicin. Drop attacks and vertical vertigo can occur after transtympanic gentamicin and can be well managed with high doses of local gentamicin.
We report the case of a 55-year-old man who had a parkinsonian syndrome unresponsive to levodopa for 5 years and had been taking verapamil during the past 8 years. Parkinsonian signs improved markedly after withdrawal of verapamil, suggesting its role in unmasking the parkinsonism. To our knowledge, this side effect of verapamil has not been described previously.
Some investigators have proposed that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients often exhibit a worsening of tremor before the emergence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LDD). It is not clear, however, whether the presence of tremor depends on the severity of dyskinesia, nor is the precise time course of tremor relative to dyskinesia well understood. This report describes an objective study of the relationship between postural tremor and dyskinesia in eight PD patients who showed signs of choreoathetoid hand movements after a single dose of levodopa. Spectral analysis of sustained hand force provided an objective and sensitive method of detecting worsening of tremor in patients with LDD. Severity of clinical symptoms was highly correlated with severity of dyskinesia. Six of the patients exhibited increased tremor amplitude within 45 min of exposure to levodopa, with two of the six patients experiencing bilateral and four of the six having unilateral worsening of postural tremor. Tremor was more severe on the side with the more severe dyskinesia. These findings provide objective support for the notion that dyskinesia and postural tremor may stem from a common pathophysiologic mechanism.
The hemodynamic effects of nicardipine were studied in 10 normotensive patients (nine men, one woman; age 43-70 years, mean 56 years) and five patients with mild to moderate hypertension (four men, one woman; age 46-72 years, mean 62.8 years); in all patients coronary heart disease was confirmed by angiography. Hemodynamic parameters were determined before and after intravenous administration of nicardipine in cumulative doses of 2.5, 7.5, and 12.5 mg for 10 min each. Nicardipine significantly reduced systolic aortic pressure, diastolic aortic pressure, and mean aortic pressure in normotensive patients [139 +/- 8.7 vs. 114 +/- 9.2 mm Hg (p < 0.001), 73 +/- 9.1 vs. 56 +/- 7.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001), 97 +/- 7.8 vs. 7.8 +/- 7.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001), respectively] and in hypertensive patients [166 +/- 7.4 vs. 128 +/- 8.6 mm Hg (p < 0.001), 83 +/- 9.4 vs. 56 +/- 10.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001), 110 +/- 15.5 vs. 78 +/- 12.0 mm Hg (p < 0.001), respectively]. Systemic vascular resistance was decreased significantly in hypertensive patients [1,363 +/- 188 vs. 707 +/- 137.7 dyn sec cm-5 (p < 0.001)] and in normotensive patients [1,110 +/- 225.3 vs. 682 +/- 92.4 dyn sec cm-5 (p < 0.001)]. Heart rate increased from 68 +/- 6.8 to 83 +/- 11.4 beats/min (p < 0.001) in normotensive patients but the increase from 72 +/- 14.7 to 80 +/- 14.2 beats/min in hypertensive patients was not significant. Mean pulmonary artery pressure did not change significantly in hypertensive patients and increased slightly in normotensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To determine the optimal concentration of lidocaine that reduces pain on injection of a propofol-lidocaine mixture.
Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, clinical investigation.
Medical center, university teaching hospital.
240 ASA physical status I and II female outpatients, aged 21 to 65 years, undergoing dilation and curettage with propofol for anesthesia induction.
Patients were randomized to one of four groups in double-blinded fashion. In Group A (control), patients were given propofol containing normal saline; in Group B, Group C, and Group D, patients received propofol containing 0.05% lidocaine (Group B), propofol containing 0.1% lidocaine (Group C), and propofol containing 0.2% lidocaine (Group D) for induction.
The incidence of pain on injection of propofol was significantly decreased in Group C and Group D (8.3% and 10.0%, respectively) in comparison to the control group (91.7%) (p < 0.001). Although the result in Group B (76.7%) was better than that in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. No significant difference was seen between Group C and Group D.
The optimal effective concentration of lidocaine, which decreased the incidence of pain caused by propofol injection, was 0.1% in the currently studied population.
Recent studies demonstrate that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is closely involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. This study investigated the role of MMP-9 in hippocampal cell death after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). We showed that MMP-9 expression and activity significantly increased and beta1-integrin levels decreased on day 3 after SE. beta1-integrin degradation was also observed in hippocampal ex vivo extracts incubated with recombinant active MMP-9. Treatment with a selective MMP-9 inhibitor attenuated MMP-9 up-regulation, beta1-integrin degradation, the reduction of ILK activity and Akt phosphorylation, and subsequent hippocampal damage after SE. However, co-treatment with anti-beta1-integrin antibody almost completely blocked the protective effects of the MMP-9 inhibitor on both integrin-mediated survival signaling and hippocampal cell death. Our study demonstrates that MMP-9 induces apoptotic hippocampal cell death by interrupting integrin-mediated survival signaling after SE and suggests that MMP-9 may be a promising target for a neuroprotective approach to preventing seizure-induced hippocampal damage.
The role of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in the pathophysiology of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is not known. Here we investigate the effects of 1) the 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton and 2) 5-LOX gene knockout (5-LOX(-/-)) mice on renal dysfunction and injury caused by I/R of the kidney in mice. Wild-type mice treated with zileuton (3 mg/kg i.v.) or 5-LOX(-/-) mice were subjected to bilateral renal artery occlusion (30 min) followed by reperfusion (24 h). Plasma urea, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured as markers of renal dysfunction and reperfusion injury. Kidneys were used for histological evaluation of renal injury. Renal myeloperoxidase activity was measured and used as an indicator of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration and renal expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was determined using immunohistochemistry. Administration of zileuton before I/R significantly reduced the degree of renal dysfunction (urea, creatinine) and injury (AST, histology). In addition, zileuton reduced the expression of ICAM-1 and the associated PMN infiltration caused by I/R of the mouse kidney. Compared with wild-type mice, the degree of renal dysfunction, injury, and inflammation caused by I/R in 5-LOX(-/-) mice was also significantly reduced, confirming the pathophysiological role of 5-LOX in the development of renal I/R injury. We propose that 1) endogenous 5-LOX metabolites enhance the degree of renal injury, dysfunction, and inflammation caused by I/R of the kidney by promoting the expression of adhesion molecules, and 2) inhibitors of 5-LOX may be useful in the treatment of conditions associated with I/R of the kidney.
Smokers often report an anxiolytic effect of cigarettes. In addition, stress-related disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression are often associated with chronic nicotine use. To study the role of the alpha5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit in anxiety-related responses, control and alpha5 subunit null mice (alpha5(-/-)) were subjected to the open field activity (OFA), light-dark box (LDB) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. In the OFA and LDB, alpha5(-/-) behaved like wild-type controls. In the EPM, female alpha5(-/-) mice displayed an anxiolytic-like phenotype, while male alpha5(-/-) mice were undistinguishable from littermate controls. We studied the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis by measuring plasma corticosterone and hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor. Consistent with an anxiolytic-like phenotype, female alpha5(-/-) mice displayed lower basal corticosterone levels. To test whether gonadal steroids regulate the expression of alpha5, we treated cultured NTera 2 cells with progesterone and found that alpha5 protein levels were upregulated. In addition, brain levels of alpha5 mRNA increased upon progesterone injection into ovariectomized wild-type females. Finally, we tested anxiety levels in the EPM during the estrous cycle. The estrus phase (when progesterone levels are low) is anxiolytic-like in wild-type mice, but no cycle-dependent fluctuations in anxiety levels were found in alpha5(-/-) females. Thus, alpha5-containing neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may be mediators of anxiogenic responses, and progesterone-dependent modulation of alpha5 expression may contribute to fluctuations in anxiety levels during the ovarian cycle.
To investigate the relationship between the degree of week 24 HBV suppression and week 48 therapeutic response in entecavir-treated chronic hepatitis B patients in whom lamivudine treatment failed, so as to explore a useful predictor for efficacy of enticavir treatment.
Thirty-three patients with chronic hepatitis B refractory to lamivudine were enrolled to receive treatment with entecavir 1.0 mg once daily. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to serum HBV DNA levels (copies/mL) at week 24: PCR-undetectable (less than 300 copies/ml); QL- less than 3 log10 copies/ml; 3 log10(-4) log10 copies/ml; greater than 4 log10 copies/mL, and the efficacy achieved at week 48 was evaluated.
At week 48, mean reductions of serum HBV DNA from baseline was 4.91 log10. HBV DNA became undetectable by PCR assay in 33.3 percent patients and ALT became normal in 75.8%. The lower the HBV DNA level achieved at week 24, the higher the proportion of patients in whom HBV DNA became undetectable by PCR and ALT normalization were acquired at week 48, and viral breakthrough at week 48 also decreased.
Undetectable HBV DNA by PCR at week 24 in entecavir-treated chronic hepatitis B patients who were refractory to lamivudine, suggests a better efficacy at week 48. The degree of week 24 suppression of HBV may be used as a predictor of long term outcome.
A 17-month-old boy developed grand mal seizures secondary to lidocaine toxicity during balloon dilatation of a congenital pulmonary valve stenosis. Lidocaine at 38 mg/kg (nine times the recommended maximum dose of 4.5 mg/kg) was administered during a 90-min period in order to optimize local anesthesia. This resulted in toxic serum lidocaine levels (8.7 mg/L; therapeutic range, 1.5-5 mg/L) at the time of seizures. Caution should be exercised with local anesthetics during invasive cardiac catheterizations. Hypercarbia (which lowers the seizure threshold to local anesthetics) should be avoided and the temptation to exceed the maximum recommended dose resisted.
Amphetamine withdrawal and major depression share many behavioral commonalities in humans. Therefore, the examination of the behavioral effects of amphetamine withdrawal in rodents may provide insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying both disorders and aid in the development of animal models of depression that are sensitive to antidepressant agents.
We examined the behavioral effects of withdrawal from chronic continuous infusion of amphetamine (via minipump) in three behavioral paradigms: the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure in rats, the modified forced swim test in rats, and the tail suspension test in mice.
Amphetamine withdrawal resulted in a prolonged (5 day) deficit in brain reward function as assessed by elevations in ICSS thresholds. Using a similar regimen of amphetamine administration, we examined the behavioral effects of withdrawal in a modified rat forced swim test. Animals that were treated with the highest dose of amphetamine (10 mg/kg/day) exhibited increased climbing behavior and decreased immobility 24 hours after withdrawal; by the 48-hour testing time point, this effect had dissipated. In contrast, animals that had been pretreated with 5 mg/kg/day amphetamine exhibited a pronounced increase in immobility indicative of an increase in "depressive-like" behavior, coupled with decreases in swimming and climbing. In the mouse tail suspension test, both regimens of amphetamine pretreatment induced increases in immobility scores, also indicative of "depressive-like" behavior, 24 hours following withdrawal.
Withdrawal from chronic amphetamine administration results in behavioral changes that may be analogous to some aspects of depression in humans, such as reward deficits (i.e., elevations in brain reward thresholds) and behaviors opposite to those seen after treatment with antidepressant drugs, such as decreased immobility in the forced swim test and the tail suspension test.
Pioglitazone is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the thiazolidinedione class. Only one case of hepatotoxicity related to this agent has previously been reported.
To report the clinical course of a patient with hepatitis after therapy with pioglitazone.
Case report.
A community hospital.
A 49-year-old diabetic man taking pioglitazone, 30 mg/d.
Discontinuation of pioglitazone therapy.
Serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels, standard blood tests for causes of hepatitis and cirrhosis other than drug toxicity, and liver biopsy.
After 6 months of pioglitazone therapy, significant hepatic dysfunction developed. Blood tests excluded viral, metabolic, and autoimmune disorders. Liver biopsy showed mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury compatible with drug toxicity. After treatment with pioglitazone was discontinued, liver enzyme values returned to normal.
Patients receiving pioglitazone may develop serious liver injury and should be observed for evidence of hepatitis.
Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) may be precipitated by aggressive correction of a hypo or hyper-osmolar states. We describe the case of a 53-year-old woman that was started on fluoxetine 20 mg/day for depression and nine days later was found to have fluoxetine-induced syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. After hyponatremia correction the mental status of the patient gradually improved, but subsequently she had intermittent difficulty in speaking, naming objects, memory deficits and psychomotor slowness. Magnetic resonance revealed bilateral symmetric hyperintense lesions in the basal ganglia, temporal lobe and hippocampal formation compatible with ODS. These symptoms gradually resolved and she was discharged home without any deficits. Two months later, a new image showed lesion in pons and the other lesions had disappeared. Fluoxetine therapy had never been related with a complication like that.
Previous reports have demonstrated that an intestinal injury causes hypofunctions of the liver associated with down-regulations of cytochrome P450, but an influence on hepatic transporters remains unclear. Here, we tested hepatic transporter functions in a rat model of bowel injury using indomethacin (IDM). After administration of IDM (8.5 mg/kg, i.p., 3 d), the rats suffered the intestinal impairment indicated by a reduction of alkaline phosphatase activity in mucosa. In vivo pharmacokinetic experiments of bromosulfophthalein (BSP) showed that there was a reduction in its plasma elimination rate and cumulative biliary excretion in IDM-treated rats and systemic and biliary clearances reduced to nearly 50% of the control group. Protein expressions in plasma membrane and mRNA levels of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b2 (Oatp1b2) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), which play hepatic BSP uptake and biliary excretion, respectively, in the liver were significantly reduced following the IDM treatment. In portal plasma, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines were unchanged, while the level of nitric oxide metabolites (NO2- + NO3-) increased to 6.5-fold that of the control. The time-course on IDM treatment indicated that, firstly, intestinal injury was induced, the NO level increased, and the hepatic Oatp1b2 and Mrp2 expression began to fall followed by an increase in plasma ALT. In conclusion, IDM-induced injury to the small intestine causes the hypofunction of hepatic Oatp1b2 and Mrp2 independently on the hepatic impairment, and NO arising from bowel injury may be one of key factors for it through the remote effect.
The involvement of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) gene polymorphisms (ecNOS4a/b and Glu-Asp298) on the shedding of tumor cells in the blood of 61 patients with prostate cancer (PCa), was analyzed. Hematogenous micrometastasis with blood circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may be an early event in the natural history of PCa metastization. CTCs can be detected by the presence of messenger RNA prostate specific membrane antigen by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We found an association between ecNOS4a/b genotypes presenting the a allele (ab/aa) with the presence of CTCs in the blood of PCa under the age of 67 years (P=0.003) and with localized disease (P=0.012). This association was not found for Glu-Asp298 genotypes. In summary, we have identified a nitric oxide related genetic factor associated with micrometastization of prostate cancer. We hypothesize that genotypes with the a allele of the ecNOS4a/b polymorphism may facilitate the survival of CTCs in the blood of cancer patients.
The discovery of an activating somatic mutation in codon 617 of the gene encoding the Janus kinase (JAK)-2 (JAK2 V617F) in patients with myeloproliferative disorders has opened new avenues for the development of targeted therapies for these malignancies. However, no effective JAK2 inhibitors are currently available for clinical use.
We investigated the activity of (E)-3(6-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-cyano-N-(S0-1phenylethyl)acrylamide (WP1066), a novel analogue of the JAK2 inhibitor AG490, in JAK2 V617F-positive erythroleukemia HEL cells and in blood cells from patients with polycythemia vera.
We found that WP1066 significantly inhibited JAK2 and its downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, signal transducer and activator of transcription-5, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 pathways in a dose- and time-dependent manner. As a result, WP1066 concentrations in the low micromolar range induced time- and dose-dependent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in HEL cells. As expected, WP1066 inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitors of patients with polycythemia vera carrying the JAK2 V617F mutation in a dose-dependent manner.
Our data suggest that WP1066 is active both in vitro and ex vivo and should be further developed for the treatment of neoplasms expressing the JAK2 V617F mutation.
We gained knowledge of the etiology, treatment and prevention of cyclophosphamide associated urothelial cancer.
The medical records of 6 men and 6 women (mean age 55 years) with cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer were reviewed.
All tumors were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell carcinoma. Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease. Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months. The remaining patient with extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later.
Cyclophosphamide associated bladder tumor is an aggressive disease. However, long-term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for bladder tumors with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease, even when noninvasive.
A double-blind clinical trial of mitoxantrone versus methylprednisolone was performed in 49 patients with relapsing, secondary multiple sclerosis. Patients were randomized to receive 13 infusions of mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 (n = 28), or 13 infusions of 1 g of methylprednisolone (n = 21), over 32 months. Twenty-four patients completed the trial. There were no statistical differences between the two groups of patients at study entry. A significant improvement in the Expanded Disability Scale Score (EDSS) was observed in the mitoxantrone group after one year of treatment (p < 0.0022). The total number of relapses, the mean number of relapses/patient/year, and the total number of gadolinium-enhanced lesions on bi-annual MRI scans were significantly decreased in the mitoxantrone group throughout the study period. Nausea, vomiting, and alopecia were more frequent in the mitoxantrone-treated patients. Mitoxantrone has a role in the treatment of MS patients with frequent exacerbations and rapid disease progression.
Individuals with gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), the most aggressive malignancy of the biliary tract, have a poor prognosis. Here we report the identification of somatic mutations for GBC in 57 tumor-normal pairs through a combination of exome sequencing and ultra-deep sequencing of cancer-related genes. The mutation pattern is defined by a dominant prevalence of C>T mutations at TCN sites. Genes with a significant frequency (false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05) of non-silent mutations include TP53 (47.1%), KRAS (7.8%) and ERBB3 (11.8%). Moreover, ErbB signaling (including EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4 and their downstream genes) is the most extensively mutated pathway, affecting 36.8% (21/57) of the GBC samples. Multivariate analyses further show that cases with ErbB pathway mutations have a worse outcome (P=0.001). These findings provide insight into the somatic mutational landscape in GBC and highlight the key role of the ErbB signaling pathway in GBC pathogenesis.
Idiopathic achalasia is characterized by a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax due to a loss of neurons in the myenteric plexus. This ultimately leads to massive dilatation and an irreversibly impaired megaesophagus. We performed a genetic association study in 1,068 achalasia cases and 4,242 controls and fine-mapped a strong MHC association signal by imputing classical HLA haplotypes and amino acid polymorphisms. An eight-residue insertion at position 227-234 in the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-DQβ1 (encoded by HLA-DQB1*05:03 and HLA-DQB1*06:01) confers the strongest risk for achalasia (P=1.73×10(-19)). In addition, two amino acid substitutions in the extracellular domain of HLA-DQα1 at position 41 (lysine encoded by HLA-DQA1*01:03; P=5.60×10(-10)) and of HLA-DQβ1 at position 45 (glutamic acid encoded by HLA-DQB1*03:01 and HLA-DQB1*03:04; P=1.20×10(-9)) independently confer achalasia risk. Our study implies that immune-mediated processes are involved in the pathophysiology of achalasia.
Centrioles are microtubule-based, barrel-shaped structures that initiate the assembly of centrosomes and cilia. How centriole length is precisely set remains elusive. The microcephaly protein CPAP (also known as MCPH6) promotes procentriole growth, whereas the oral-facial-digital (OFD) syndrome protein OFD1 represses centriole elongation. Here we uncover a new subtype of OFD with severe microcephaly and cerebral malformations and identify distinct mutations in two affected families in the evolutionarily conserved C2CD3 gene. Concordant with the clinical overlap, C2CD3 colocalizes with OFD1 at the distal end of centrioles, and C2CD3 physically associates with OFD1. However, whereas OFD1 deletion leads to centriole hyperelongation, loss of C2CD3 results in short centrioles without subdistal and distal appendages. Because C2CD3 overexpression triggers centriole hyperelongation and OFD1 antagonizes this activity, we propose that C2CD3 directly promotes centriole elongation and that OFD1 acts as a negative regulator of C2CD3. Our results identify regulation of centriole length as an emerging pathogenic mechanism in ciliopathies.
Forty patients with psoriasis were investigated for unspecific and specific lymphocyte cytotoxicity in order to evaluate the significance for liver cell damage in methotrexate-treated (MTX) patients. We found no difference between psoriasis patients with regard to cytotoxicity. We also observed a normal proliferation of lymphocytes after stimulation with tuberculin and phytohemagglutinin.
