After constant recording of haloperidol catalepsy in rats a rhythmic structure with waves of minute range was observed. On the basis of individual pharmacological sensitivity all rats may be divided in animals with strong rhythmic fluctuations but rapid tolerance (hyperkinetic type) and with weak rhythmicity but delayed adaptation to haloperidol (hypokinetic type). Oscillatory pattern of catalepsy increased after bilateral lesions of dorsal striatum and decreased after ventral striatectomy. As suggested, ventral striatum has a rhythmogenic function which conditions a more easy neuroleptic tolerance.
Effects of gestational and lactational exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on thyroid function of offspring were investigated in the rat. Pregnant Holtzman rats, TCDD-sensitive strain, were given a single oral dose of 200 ng or 800 ng TCDD/kg on gestational day 15. Parameters related to the thyroid functions were examined on postnatal days (PNDs) 21 and 49. Serum T(4) levels in offspring decreased significantly on PND21 in the two TCDD-exposed groups but increased on PND 49 only in the high-dose group. A dose of 800 ng TCDD/kg exerted a more than 2-fold increase in serum TSH level in male offspring on PNDs 21 and 49. A significant induction of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1 gene by TCDD was observed on PND 21 but returned to basal levels on PND 49. Gene expression of cytochrome P4501A1 was markedly induced in the liver treated with TCDD. Even a single oral perinatal exposure to 800 ng TCDD/kg resulted in hyperplasia of the thyroid gland of offspring on PND 49. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunocytochemistry also supported this finding. Thus, gestational and lactational exposure to TCDD was found to disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis, which results in a sustained excessive secretion of TSH, followed by the hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells.
Hypervitaminosis A-related liver toxicity may be severe and may even lead to cirrhosis. In the normal liver, vitamin A is stored in hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which are prone to becoming activated and acquiring a myofibroblast-like phenotype, producing large amounts of extracellular matrix.
In order to assess the relationship between vitamin A intake, HSC activation and fibrosis, we studied nine liver biopsies from patients belonging to a well-characterized series of 41 patients with vitamin A hepatotoxicity.
Fibrosis was underlined by Sirius-red staining, whereas activated HSC were immunohistochemically identified using an antibody against alpha smooth muscle actin. The volume density (Vv) of sinusoidal and total fibrosis and of sinusoidal and total activated HSC was quantified by the point-counting method.
Morphology ranged from HSC hypertrophy and hyperplasia as the sole features to severe architectural distortion. There was a significant positive correlation between Vv of perisinusoidal fibrosis and the daily consumption of vitamin A (P=0.004).
The close correlation between the severity of perisinusoidal fibrosis and the daily dose of the retinol intake suggests the existence of a dose-effect relationship.
The major goal of epigenetic therapy is to reverse aberrant promoter hypermethylation and restore normal function of tumor suppressor genes by the use of chromatin-modifying drugs. Decitabine, or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), is a well-characterized drug that is now Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Although 5-aza-CdR is an extremely potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, it is subject to degradation by hydrolytic cleavage and deamination by cytidine deaminase. We show that short oligonucleotides containing a 5-aza-CdR can also inhibit DNA methylation in cancer cells at concentrations comparable with 5-aza-CdR. Detailed studies with S110, a dinucleotide, showed that it works via a mechanism similar to that of 5-aza-CdR after incorporation of its aza-moiety into DNA. Stability of the triazine ring in aqueous solution was not improved in the S110 dinucleotide; however, deamination by cytidine deaminase was dramatically decreased. This is the first demonstration of the use of short oligonucleotides to provide effective delivery and cellular uptake of a nucleotide drug and protection from enzymatic degradation. This approach may pave the way for more stable and potent inhibitors of DNA methylation as well as provide means for improving existing therapeutics.
Despite concerns surrounding the possible adverse effects of marijuana on complex cognitive function, the processes contributing to the observed cognitive deficits are unclear, as are the causal relationships between these impairments and marijuana exposure. In particular, marijuana-related deficits in cognitive flexibility may affect the social functioning of the individual and may contribute to continued marijuana use. We therefore examined the ability of rats to perform affective and attentional shifts following acute administration of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive marijuana constituent. Administration of 1 mg/kg THC produced marked impairments in the ability to reverse previously relevant associations between stimulus features and reward presentation, while the ability to transfer attentional set between dimensional stimulus properties was unaffected. Concurrent in situ hybridization analysis of regional c-fos and ngfi-b expression highlighted areas of the prefrontal cortex and striatum that were recruited in response to both THC administration and task performance. Furthermore, the alterations in mRNA expression in the orbitofrontal cortex and striatum were associated with the ability to perform the reversal discriminations. These findings suggest that marijuana use may produce inelasticity in updating affective associations between stimuli and reinforcement value, and that this effect may arise through dysregulation of orbitofrontal and striatal circuitry.
Idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) is likely the consequence of both the acquisition of genetic mutations and epigenetic changes that silence critical genes that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We have explored the effects of the sequential treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, decitabine [5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5azaD)], followed by the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), on the behavior of IM CD34(+) cells. Unlike normal CD34(+) cells where 5azaD/TSA treatment leads to the expansion of CD34(+) cells and marrow-repopulating cells, treatment of IM CD34(+) cells results in a reduction of the number of total cells, CD34(+) cells, and assayable hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). In IM, HPCs are either heterozygous or homozygous for the JAK2V617F mutation or possess wild-type JAK2 in varying proportions. Exposure of IM CD34(+) cells to 5azaD/TSA resulted in a reduction of the proportion of JAK2V617F-positive HPCs in 83% of the patients studied and the reduction in the proportion of homozygous HPCs in 50% of the patients. 5azaD/TSA treatment led to a dramatic reduction in the number of HPCs that contained chromosomal abnormalities in two JAK2V617F-negative IM patients. IM is characterized by constitutive mobilization of HPCs, which has been partly attributed to decreased expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Treatment of IM CD34(+) cells with 5azaD/TSA resulted in the up-regulation of CXCR4 expression by CD34(+) cells and restoration of their migration in response to SDF-1. These data provide a rationale for sequential therapy with chromatin-modifying agents for patients with IM.
The toxicity of sublethal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) levels in soils was assessed by testing their impact on expression of annetocin, a reproduction regulating gene, and translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), a tumorigenic response gene, in the earthworm Eisenia fetida cultured in artificial soil spiked with, phenanthrene (Phe), pyrene (Pyr), fluoranthene (Flu), or benzo(a)pyrene (Bap). Annetocin and TCTP were both up-regulated by 0.1 and 1.0 mg kg(-1) benzo(a)pyrene and TCTP was down-regulated by 10.0 mg kg(-1) phenanthrene. Weight loss and cocoon production of the worms were also analyzed. Only 10.0 mg kg(-1) phenanthrene impacted earthworm weight loss significantly and no significant differences on cocoon production were observed. Our study indicated that the potential ecotoxicity of sublethal PAHs in soil should not be neglected and mRNA transcription level in earthworms was a more sensitive indicator of PAHs exposure than traditional indexes using cocoon production as endpoints and/or using the whole-organism as the test materials.
The objective of this study was to examine and attempt to confirm our previous findings of an increased frequency of the C4B null allele (C4BQ0) in subjects with autism. Newly identified subjects from Utah and Oregon were studied. Families evaluated included 85 who had a child with autism and 69 control families. Of the subjects with autism studied, 42.4% carried at least one C4BQ0, compared with 14.5% of the control subjects (p = 0.00013), with a relative risk of 4.33. Over half of the C4B null alleles in the subjects with autism involved C4A duplications. A marked increase in the ancestral haplotype 44.1 that lacks a C4B gene and has 2 C4A genes was also observed. The results of this study suggest that the human leukocyte antigen class III C4BQ0 significantly increases the risk for autism.
We carried out clinical and bacteriological studies on clavulanic acid/amoxicillin and amoxicillin in pediatric sinusitis at 11 general practice settings. The results are summarized as follows. 1. The major isolated organisms from content of middle meatus were Streptococcus pneumoniae 32.2%, Haemophilus influenzae 32.0% and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 25.1%. Similar results were observed for the major isolates from nasopharynx. 2. 62.1% of S. pneumoniae isolated were drug resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP, PRSP) and they were increasing year by year. 3. Drug resistant S. pneumoniae was isolated from 38.6% of all cases. 4. Regarding MIC90, CVA/AMPC showed superior antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis. 5. The clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and utility of CVA/AMPC-treated group were 78%, 58% and 72.8%, respectively, and they were significantly superior to AMPC-treated group. 6. Adverse reactions were observed in 11.2% of CVA/AMPC group, involving diarrhea and stool loose and there was no statistical deference from those of AMPC group.
To investigate the chemopreventive effects of 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) in diethylnitrosamine induced, phenobarbital promoted rat hepatocarcinogenesis.
The rats were randomly divided into 6 different groups (A-F). Groups A, C and E rats received a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) at a dose of 200 mg/kg body mass in 9 g/L NaCl solution at 4 wk of age, while group B served as normal vehicle control received normal saline once. After a brief recovery of 2 wk, all the DEN treated rats were given phenobarbital (PB) at 0.5 g/L daily in the basal diet till wk 20. Group A was DEN control. Treatment of 1alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 in group C was started 4 wk prior to DEN injection and continued thereafter till wk 20 at a dose of 0.3 microg/100 microL propylene glycol per one single dose (os) twice a week. Group E received the treatment of 1alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 at the same dose mentioned as above for 15 wk. The rats in group D and F received 1alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 alone as in group C without DEN injection.
The comet assay showed statistically higher mean values for length to width ratios (L: W) of DNA mass and tailed cells (P<0.01; P<0.01 respectively) in DEN treated rats as compared to their normal controls. Continuous supplementation of 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitaminD2 showed a significant (P<0.01) decrease in L:W ratio of DNA mass tailed cells. Furthermore, 1alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 supplementations elevated the super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity, hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) level, reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity (P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.05 and P<0.05 respectively). As an endpoint marker histological changes were observed to establish the chemopreventive effects of 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitaminD2.
Supplementations of 1alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 has a marked protection against hepatic nodulogenesis, antioxidant enzymes and DNA damages in DEN induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis promoted by phenobarbital.
We carried out clinical and bacteriological studies on clavulanic acid/amoxicillin and amoxicillin in pediatric acute otitis media at 14 general practice settings. The results are summarized as follows. 1. The major isolated organisms from content of middle ear effusion were Streptococcus pneumoniae 31.8%, Haemophilus influenzae 35.8% and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 1.5%. Similar results were observed for the major isolates organisms from content of nasopharynx Streptococcus pneumoniae 31.1%, Haemophilus influenzae 33.9% and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 19.2%. 2. 42.2% of S. pneumoniae isolated from middle ear effusion were drug resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP, PRSP) and they were increasing year by year. 3. 46.7% of S. pneumoniae isolated from nasopharyngeal swab were drug resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP, PRSP) and they were increasing year by year. The incidence of drug resistant S. pneumoniae isolated from all cases and organisms were 26.3% and 14.5%, respectively. 4. On MIC90, antimicrobial activity of CVA/AMPC against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis was superior to SBTPC. 5. In the evaluation of clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and utility, CVA/AMPC-treated group was significantly superior to AMPC-treated group. 6. Adverse reactions were observed in 22% of CVA/AMPC-treated group, involving diarrhea and loose stool.
Male erectile dysfunction increases in prevalence in patients with severe chronic renal failure. Since arterial hypertension induces significant damage in cavernous tissue (CT), and considering that hypertension is extremely common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the most conventionally employed antihypertensive drugs on CT in a rat model of renal insufficiency.
Five groups of male rats with subtotal nephrectomy (STNx) and 1 with sham operations were studied over 6 months: STNx without treatment, STNx with benazepril (BZ), STNx with losartan (LS), STNx with amlodipine (AML) and STNx with atenolol (AT) plus the sham group. All rats were sacrificed at 6 months after STNx, and penises processed for LM and immunohistochemical studies. Cavernous smooth muscle (CSM) and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) from cavernous arteries and the amount of collagen type III were evaluated.
All groups with antihypertensive drugs showed similar control in blood pressure throughout the study. Un-treated STNx, STNx with AML and STNx with AT presented significant (p<0.01) hypertrophy in both VSM and CSM, together with an increased amount of collagen type III in CT. Conversely, STNx with either BZ or LS showed a substantial (p<0.01) reduction in all of these variables, with values not different from the sham group. There was a significant (p<0.01) negative correlation between creatinine clearance and the amount of VSM, CSM and collagen type III deposition in CT in untreated STNx, STNx with AML and STNx with AT, but not in STNx with BZ, STNx with LS and sham.
These results suggest that the interactions against the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) either by ACE inhibitors or angiotensin AT1 receptor blockers produce considerable benefits regarding structural abnormalities in CT in this animal model of renal insufficiency beyond blood pressure control.
To report a case of ketorolac tromethamine-induced acute renal failure and to discuss the risk factors that make patients more susceptible to the renal effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Case reports and review articles identified by MEDLINE. Indexing terms included ketorolac, renal failure, and NSAIDs.
Data were abstracted from pertinent published English-language sources and were reviewed by all authors.
Ketorolac is an intramuscularly administered NSAID with many of the same adverse effects associated with other oral NSAIDs. Although reversible depression of renal function has been associated with several NSAIDs, to date there have been no published reports of acute renal failure secondary to ketorolac administration. A 71-year-old woman received three doses of ketorolac to control the pain associated with pelvic and T11-T12 compression fractures. Over the next two days, the patient developed signs and symptoms of acute renal failure, including significant increases in blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and peripheral edema. These signs and symptoms resolved over the next three to four days. Certain risk factors, several of which were present in this woman, make individual patients more susceptible to the renal affects of NSAIDs. These risk factors include advanced age, cirrhosis, volume depletion, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and preexisting mild renal dysfunction.
Caution should be taken when initiating ketorolac or any NSAID therapy with specific attention to risk factors that predispose a patient to renal dysfunction.
The xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA) used in the manufacturing of various plastics and resins for food packaging and consumer products has been shown to produce numerous endocrine and developmental effects in rodents. Exposure to low doses of BPA during fetal mammary gland development resulted in significant alterations in the gland's morphology that varied from subtle ones observed during the exposure period to precancerous and cancerous lesions manifested in adulthood. This study assessed the effects of BPA on fetal mammary gland development in nonhuman primates. Pregnant rhesus monkeys were fed 400 μg of BPA per kg of body weight daily from gestational day 100 to term, which resulted in 0.68 ± 0.312 ng of unconjugated BPA per mL of maternal serum, a level comparable to that found in humans. At birth, the mammary glands of female offspring were removed for morphological analysis. Morphological parameters similar to those shown to be affected in rodents exposed prenatally to BPA were measured in whole-mounted glands; estrogen receptor (ER) α and β expression were assessed in paraffin sections. Student's t tests for equality of means were used to assess differences between exposed and unexposed groups. The density of mammary buds was significantly increased in BPA-exposed monkeys, and the overall development of their mammary gland was more advanced compared with unexposed monkeys. No significant differences were observed in ER expression. Altogether, gestational exposure to the estrogen-mimic BPA altered the developing mammary glands of female nonhuman primates in a comparable manner to that observed in rodents.
A 14-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed acute ascending myelitis followed by encephalopathy after intrathecal administration of methotrexate 15 mg and cytosine arabinoside 50 mg. The patient had none of the risk factors noted previously in other patients with intrathecal therapy (IT) induced neurotoxicity. The doses administered were within the standard scales, and toxicity developed in the second boost of IT 20 days after the first one. There may not be any parameters to predict the occurrence of such severe and rare form of CNS neurotoxicity attributed to IT.
Chronic hydroxyurea therapy is associated with numerous cutaneous adverse effects. While hydroxyurea-associated nonmelanoma skin cancers are known to be associated with significant morbidity and occasional mortality, to date, dermatomyositis-like eruption has been considered a benign entity, other than its ability to mimic true dermatomyositis leading to inappropriate immunosuppression. More recently, hydroxyurea-associated squamous dysplasia has been characterized as a premalignant precursor to hydroxyurea-associated nonmelanoma skin cancers and shown to manifest abnormal p53 expression.
An elderly woman receiving chronic hydroxyurea therapy for myelodysplasia developed a dermatomyositis-like eruption that was misdiagnosed as true dermatomyositis, leading to continuation of hydroxyurea. Years later she developed severe hydroxyurea-associated nonmelanoma skin cancers resulting in discontinuation of hydroxyurea, poor control of her myelodysplasia, and death. Re-evaluation with immunohistochemical analysis of tissue from her original dermatomyositis-like eruption revealed focal confluent nuclear expression of p53 along the lower layers of the epidermis, suggestive of a premalignant state.
We suggest that dermatomyositis-like eruption and hydroxyurea-associated squamous dysplasia represent similar clinical manifestations of a common underlying chronic phototoxic process involving aberrant keratinocyte p53 expression mediated by hydroxyurea's antimetabolite properties and UV radiation exposure. Accordingly, we suggest that dermatomyositis-like eruption, previously considered a benign entity, may represent a premalignant precursor of hydroxyurea-associated nonmelanoma skin cancers warranting discontinuation of hydroxyurea therapy.
It was established that propranolol in a daily dose of 2 mg/kg causes disturbance of behavior of rats with arterial hypertension in the open field, deteriorates retention of memory traces in passive avoidance paradigm, and leads to the development of depression in the test for zoosocial interrelation. Administration of nootropic piracetam (200 kg/mg/24 h). as well as the original compounds ACP-94 (20 mg/kg/24 h) and PIR-87--6-0 (50-mg/kg/24 h) facilitates the correction of negative changes in the behavior and memory of hypertensive rats.
To determine the incidence and possible risk factors associated with chlorpropamide (CPA)-induced hyponatremia in the veteran population.
Retrospective cohort study.
Federal tertiary care medical center.
Veterans receiving CPA from our facility with at least one serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L within the past year were eligible. A randomly selected control group consisting of patients taking CPA with normal sodium concentrations was also chosen. One hundred forty-five of 799 patients who had received CPA were included in the study.
The average daily dose of CPA was 425 +/- 207 mg (+/- SD). The incidence of hyponatremia associated with CPA was 7.1 percent (57/799 patients). The majority of patients were mildly hyponatremic (48/57 patients, 84 percent) with serum sodium concentrations between 130 and 134 mmol/L. The incidence of CPA-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone was 2.1 percent. Concurrent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use was identified as a risk factor; thiazide diuretic use was not.
The incidence of hyponatremia related to CPA use in elderly veterans is consistent with other reports in the literature. ACE inhibitors may be a predisposing factor for CPA-induced hyponatremia.
To report a case of possible cloxacillin-induced acute tubulo interstitial nephritis (AIN).
A 15-year-old male patient presented with hypertension, edema, lumbar pain, sterile pyuria, eosinophiluria (ten percent), and severe renal dysfunction three months after the ingestion of cloxacillin. A renal biopsy revealed diffuse edema and inflammatory infiltrate of the interstitium (five percent eosinophils). He received four sessions of peritoneal dialysis with dramatic improvement in urinary output and renal function. His biochemical parameters returned to normal values 21 days after admission, without the use of glucocorticosteroids.
Published case reports on AIN induced by penicillin and related drugs are reviewed and compared. The role of interstitial edema in acute renal failure associated with drug-induced AIN is mentioned.
AIN is a rare but significant complication of therapy with penicillin and related drugs. The clinical picture is similar for all of these drugs, but skin rash and fever are absent in AIN induced by cloxacillin and cloxacillin-related drugs. Dialysis improved the patient's urinary output and renal function. Beta-lactam antibiotics should be avoided in patients with cloxacillin-induced AIN.
To determine whether photoreceptor degeneration can stimulate Müller glia to transdifferentiate into neurons in adult mammalian retina, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was injected to induce complete loss of photoreceptors. Following MNU administration, Müller glia underwent reactive gliosis characterized by up-regulation of glial fibrillar acidic protein and nestin, and initiated proliferation through the cyclin D1 and D3 related pathways. Some Müller glia-derived cells were induced to express rhodopsin exclusively. These rhodopsin-positive cells exhibited synaptophysin around them, suggesting possible formation of synapses. After transplanted in to damaged retina, Müller glia migrated, grafted in host retina and produced rhodopsin. These results suggest that degeneration may promote preferential differentiation of Müller glia to photoreceptors and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for retinal degenerative diseases.
Patients who have oligodendrogliomas (OD) that demonstrate loss of both 1p and 19q appear to have a better prognosis after they receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared with patients who have OD without these characteristics. It is unclear whether this improvement in outcome is due only to a better response to treatment. The authors investigated the correlation between genetic and clinical characteristics of OD in 33 patients who received chemotherapy with procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine for recurrent disease after receiving radiotherapy.
The initial presentation, prior treatments, overall survival, and response to chemotherapy were assessed. The 1p and 19q status in OD lesions was determined with fluorescence in situ hybridization on paraffin embedded, archival material using locus specific probes. P53 mutations were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and immunohistochemistry for P53; the proliferation index was assessed with the MIB-1 antibody.
Patients who had OD lesions with a combined loss of 1p and 19q typically presented with low-grade tumors that manifested with seizures of long-standing duration. In contrast, patients who had OD lesions without a combined loss of 1p and 19q usually presented with focal deficits that required immediate treatment. Both the response rate to chemotherapy and the time to disease progression after chemotherapy were significantly better in patients who had a combined loss of 1p and 19. Tumors with classic OD morphology more often had a combined loss of 1p and 19q, although the genotype was better at identifying patients with chemoresponsive tumors. P53 mutations were observed in three tumors, none of which had a combined loss of 1p and 19q.
OD lesions with combined a loss of 1p and 19q have a more indolent nature compared with OD lesions that do not have these losses. Virtually all patients with these tumors present with low-grade tumors accompanied by seizures and remain stable for prolonged periods. Future trials must keep these tumor types apart.
Seventy-seven patients with small cell lung carcinoma were assigned randomly to two chemotherapy regimens to assess their psychological response to each regimen. One produced less depression and fatigue than the other, despite the absence of differences in tumor response.
We attempted to reduce the carcinoma induction latency period and to produce a transplantable urinary bladder cancer in dogs. After transurethral pellet application, 12 of 22 female beagles were given subcutaneous injections of orthoaminodiphenyl, FANFT, or both. Monthly cytologic and histologic checks yielded the earliest evidence yet obtained for invasive urothelial urinary bladder carcinoma (15 months); seven urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder and three of the renal pelvis were established. Tissue cultures of the urothelial carcinomas in vitro were successful. Transplantation of tumor cells to 23 nude mice resulted in tumor growth in 19. Transplantation to 10 beagles yielded 2 tumors very quickly, but the tumors were rejected within 4 weeks.
The objective of this review is to systematically analyze the prospective randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of diltiazem (DTZ) and glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) for the pharmacological management of chronic anal fissure (CAF).
A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. Prospective randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of DTZ for the management of CAF were selected according to specific criteria and analyzed to generate summative data.
Five studies encompassing 263 patients with CAF were retrieved from the electronic databases. Only two randomized controlled trials on 103 patients qualified for the meta-analysis. There were 53 patients in the DTZ group and 50 patients in the GTN group. Both DTZ and GTN were equally effective for the treatment of CAF (random-effect model risk ratio [RR] 0.29 [90.06-1.33] 95% confidence interval [CI], z=0.62, p=0.536). However, there was significant heterogeneity between the trials. GTN was associated with higher side effects rate (fixed-effect model RR 0.45 [0.28-0.73] 95% CI, z= -3.22, p=0.001) and higher headache rate (fixed-effect model RR 0.33 [0.17-0.64] 95% CI, z= -3.27, p=0.001) as compared to DTZ. There was no statistically significant recurrence rate of CAF between two pharmacotherapies (fixed-effect model RR 0.66 [0.18-2.41] 95% CI, z= -0.62, p=0.535).
Both DTZ and GTN are equally effective and can be used for the management of CAF. However, GTN is associated with a higher rate of side effects (headache/anal irritation), and it should be replaced by DTZ. The recurrence rate of CAF after the use of both pharmacotherapies is equal.
