To report 3 successful treatments of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium meningitis in adults using daptomycin and either linezolid or gentamicin.
Three case reports involving males (aged 58-78 years) are presented; in each case (trigeminal nerve microvascular decompression and subdural hygroma; paraspinal abscess; and hydrocephalus with subsequent craniotomy and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement) CSF examination revealed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) susceptible to daptomycin, gentamicin, and/or linezolid. Threeto four-week treatment regimens with daptomycin 6-12 mg/kg and either gentamicin or linezolid led to clinical resolution and microbiological clearance of infection.
Daptomycin has previously been shown to be successful in treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated meningitis and other serious VRE and enterococcal infections. Higher than approved doses of daptomycin were used in 2 cases where in theory higher CSF concentrations would thus be obtained. Gentamicin and linezolid were added to daptomycin therapy based on in vitro data synergy results and because of documented successful treatment for VRE meningitis, respectively.
The difficulty in treating VRE CSF infections involves both drug kinetics and microbial resistance factors, as well as external factors such as foreign bodies like shunts. This report highlighted 3 cases where daptomycin use in concert with either gentamicin or linezolid was successful in treating this infection. Additional controlled trials will be helpful in identifying the best strategies when using daptomycin to treat CSF infections.
Exposure to the brominated flame retardant 2,2 ,4,4 ,5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE-99) during the brain growth spurt disrupts normal brain development in mice and results in disturbed spontaneous behavior in adulthood. The neurodevelopmental toxicity of PBDE-99 has been reported to affect the cholinergic and catecholaminergic systems. In this study we use a proteomics approach to study the early effect of PBDE-99 in two distinct regions of the neonatal mouse brain, the striatum and the hippocampus. A single oral dose of PBDE-99 (12 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle was administered to male NMRI mice on neonatal day 10, and the striatum and the hippocampus were isolated. Using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), we found 40 and 56 protein spots with significantly (p < 0.01) altered levels in the striatum and the hippocampus, respectively. We used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS) to determine the protein identity of 11 spots from the striatum and 10 from the hippocampus. We found that the levels of proteins involved in neurodegeneration and neuroplasticity (e.g., Gap-43/neuromodulin, stathmin) were typically altered in the striatum, and proteins involved in metabolism and energy production [e.g., alpha-enolase; gamma-enolase; ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, beta subunit (Atp5b); and alpha-synuclein] were typically altered in the hippocampus. Interestingly, many of the identified proteins have been linked to protein kinase C signaling. In conclusion, we identify responses to early exposure to PBDE-99 that could contribute to persistent neurotoxic effects. This study also shows the usefulness of proteomics to identify potential biomarkers of developmental neurotoxicity of organohalogen compounds.
Leptin, a multifunctional hormone that regulates food intake and metabolic and endocrine responses, has emerged recently as an important modulatory factor in gastric mucosal resistance to injury. In this study, we applied the animal model of gastric mucosal injury caused by indomethacin to investigate the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the mucosal leptin production. Using groups of rats subjected to intragastric administration of indomethacin (at 0-60 mg/kg), we show that gastric mucosal damage reached a maximum 4 h following the drug, and was accompanied by a marked elevation (up to 3.5-fold) in the mucosal leptin level, up to 4-fold enhancement in the expression of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) activity and up to 4.5-fold increase in ET-1 generation. Pretreatment with phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of ECE-1 activity, not only led to a decline in ECE-1 and ET-1 generation, but also produced a dose-dependent reduction in the mucosal level of leptin and the extent of mucosal damage caused by indomethacin. This effect of phosphoramidon, however, was subject to suppression by the exogenous ET-1 administration. Moreover, a marked drop in the mucosal level of leptin and the reduction in the severity of mucosal damage was attained following pretreatment with ET(A) receptor antagonist BQ610, but not by ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ788. The results implicate ET-1 as a key factor in the regulation of leptin production associated with gastric mucosal response to injury, and show that the stimulatory effect of ET-1 on leptin production occurs via ET(A) receptor activation.
We have synthesized novel heterocyclic organobismuth compounds that have potent antibacterial properties. In this study, we examined their anticancer activity and addressed the cellular mechanisms involved. Heterocyclic organobismuth compounds showed anticancer activities in various human cancer cell lines. These compounds have particularly potent anticancer activities against leukemia cell lines. One of them, bi-chlorodibenzo [c,f][1,5] thiabismocine (compound 3), inhibited the growth of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 at a concentration of 0.22 microM. Low concentrations of compound 3 (0.22-0.44 microM) induced apoptosis, whereas at a higher concentration (>1.1 microM) it causes acute necrosis. During the apoptosis, caspase-3, -8, and -9 were activated but caspase-12 was not. A broad caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), and caspase-3 (z-DEVD-fmk) and caspase-9 (z-LEHD-fmk) inhibitors suppressed the compound 3-induced apoptosis, but a caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk) was less effective, suggesting that the caspase-8 activity only partially participates in the apoptosis. In the apoptotic cells, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria to cytosol and a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) was detected. Compound 3-induced apoptosis was associated with enhanced generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pretreatment of the cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine or catalase suppressed the apoptosis. On the other hand, buthionine sulfoximine enhanced the compound 3-induced collapse of DeltaPsi(m) and apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that compound 3 is a potent inducer of apoptosis, triggering a caspase-3-mediated mechanism via the generation of ROS and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, suggesting a potential mechanism for the anticancer activity of compound 3.
To test the effectiveness and tolerance of antiviral agents associated with short term immunosuppression in the treatment of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) related to hepatitis B virus (HBV).
We conducted a prospective, nonblinded, multicenter trial in which patients with multisystemic PAN related to HBV were included. Every patient initially underwent a short term (2 weeks) treatment with prednisone and then received vidarabine (Vira A) and plasma exchanges. The end point of the study was control of the disease (recovery or remission) or death.
Thirty-three patients were included. Every patient had histopathologic or arteriographic evidence of vasculitis and was infected with actively replicating HBV. Disease activity during the first 6 months was controlled in 26 patients (78.8%). Among the 25 patients still alive at the end of the study, 24 (72.7%) had completely recovered with no clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic vasculitis after at least 18 months without treatment. Eight patients died during the study period; 3 of treatment failure, usually early in the course of the disease. One patient died of fulminant hepatitis 3 months after the entry in the study at time of seroconversion. The survival curve showed that at 7 years, 76% of the patients were alive. HBeAg/anti-HBeAb seroconversion was observed in 12 patients (36.3%) after one Vira A cycle. When a 2nd cycle of Vira A or alpha interferon was prescribed, HBeAg/anti-HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 15 patients (45.4%). Two other patients who underwent a 2nd cycle of Vira A administration, had lost HBeAg and no longer expressed serological evidence of replication as assessed by HBV DNA spot hybridization. At the end of the study, 17 (51.5%) no longer expressed serological evidence of HBV replication. This treatment was effective and only minor side effects were noted.
We conclude that this new therapeutic approach to PAN related to HBV effectively controlled systemic vasculitis and was associated with a higher number of recoveries from chronic HBV infections. The development of new antiviral agents, such as interferon alpha 2b, allows us to hope that antiviral therapy will have a role to play as a first line treatment regimen of virus induced vasculitis.
In humans, MPV17 mutations are responsible for severe mitochondrial depletion syndrome, mainly affecting the liver and the nervous system. To gain insight into physiopathology of MPV17-related disease, we investigated an available Mpv17 knockout animal model. We found severe mtDNA depletion in liver and, albeit to a lesser extent, in skeletal muscle, whereas hardly any depletion was detected in brain and kidney, up to 1 year after birth. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts did show mtDNA depletion, but only after several culturing passages, or in a serumless culturing medium. In spite of severe mtDNA depletion, only moderate decrease in respiratory chain enzymatic activities, and mild cytoarchitectural alterations, were observed in the Mpv17(-/-) livers, but neither cirrhosis nor failure ever occurred in this organ at any age. The mtDNA transcription rate was markedly increased in liver, which could contribute to compensate the severe mtDNA depletion. This phenomenon was associated with specific downregulation of Mterf1, a negative modulator of mtDNA transcription. The most relevant clinical features involved skin, inner ear and kidney. The coat of the Mpv17(-/-) mice turned gray early in adulthood, and 18-month or older mice developed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with massive proteinuria. Concomitant degeneration of cochlear sensory epithelia was reported as well. These symptoms were associated with significantly shorter lifespan. Coincidental with the onset of FSGS, there was hardly any mtDNA left in the glomerular tufts. These results demonstrate that Mpv17 controls mtDNA copy number by a highly tissue- and possibly cytotype-specific mechanism.
2,5-Dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC) is a close structural analog of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib that lacks COX-2 inhibitory function. We and others have demonstrated that DMC, despite its inability to block COX-2, is able to potently mimic the antitumor effects of celecoxib in vitro and in vivo. In this current study, we investigated whether DMC would also be able to inhibit the growth of highly drug-resistant tumor cell variants. We focused on human multiple myeloma (MM) cells, as patients with MM frequently develop drug-resistant disease and ultimately succumb to death. Here we show that DMC (and celecoxib) inhibits the proliferation of various multiple myeloma cell lines, including several (multi) drug-resistant variants. Growth inhibition in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells is mediated via multiple effects, which include diminished signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) activity, reduced expression of survivin and various cyclins, and is followed by apoptotic cell death. Thus, our study demonstrates that inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis by DMC (and celecoxib) can be accomplished even in highly drug-resistant multiple myeloma cells, and that this effect is achieved via the blockage of multiple targets that are critical for multiple myeloma cell growth and survival.
In this study, lamivudine-interferon (LAM/IFN) combination therapy was compared to LAM monotherapy to verify if the combination treatment might improve efficacy and reduce the emergence of LAM-resistant mutants.
Fifty patients with anti-HBe-positive chronic hepatitis B were treated for 12 months with LAM at 100mg/day (26 pts) or with IFN at 5MU t.i.w.+LAM 100mg/day (24 pts). Serum ALT, HBV DNA and IgM anti-HBc were monitored during treatment and a 6-month follow-up. The polymerase gene was amplified by PCR and the region coding for YMDD motif was directly sequenced.
All patients normalized ALT and cleared HBV DNA during treatment. The response was maintained until the end of therapy in the LAM/IFN group, while in 5/26 initial responders treated with LAM alone, a virological and biochemical breakthrough was observed after 6-10 months, and selection for YMDD variants resulted. After therapy discontinuation, most patients relapsed; the response rate after 6 months was 17% in the LAM/IFN group and 19% in the LAM group.
In anti-HBe-positive chronic hepatitis B, a 12-month course of LAM/IFN combination therapy is as beneficial as LAM monotherapy, however, the combination regimen appeared to prevent or delay the emergence of YMDD variants.
Chromosomal translocations involving the ERG locus are frequent events in human prostate cancer pathogenesis; however, the biological role of aberrant ERG expression is controversial. Here we show that aberrant expression of ERG is a progression event in prostate tumorigenesis. We find that prostate cancer specimens containing the TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement are significantly enriched for loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN. In concordance with these findings, transgenic overexpression of ERG in mouse prostate tissue promotes marked acceleration and progression of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) to prostatic adenocarcinoma in a Pten heterozygous background. In vitro overexpression of ERG promotes cell migration, a property necessary for tumorigenesis, without affecting proliferation. ADAMTS1 and CXCR4, two candidate genes strongly associated with cell migration, were upregulated in the presence of ERG overexpression. Thus, ERG has a distinct role in prostate cancer progression and cooperates with PTEN haploinsufficiency to promote progression of HGPIN to invasive adenocarcinoma.
The side effects of indomethacin for ductal closure in preterm neonates (e.g. increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, decreased cerebral blood volume and transient renal failure) have led clinicians to seek a safer alternative. Intravenous indomethacin and ibuprofen appear to be equally effective for patent ductus arteriosus closure, but oral ibuprofen remains an experimental option with theoretical advantages yet with potential side effects. We herein report a case of transient but severe acute renal failure developing in a preterm infant in whom oral ibuprofen was used and discuss the safety of this drug in relation to its pharmacokinetics.
We have recently shown that the introduction of a nitroxybutylester moiety into flurbiprofen, to form Flurbi-NO, results in a compound with markedly reduced undesired effects in the gastrointestinal tract. This effect has been shown to be linked to nitric oxide release from the Flurbi-NO. Here we have investigated whether this is associated with a reduction in platelet aggregability in vivo, as assessed in a mouse model of thromboembolism and a rat model of platelet aggregation, and found in both models that Flurbi-NO is more potent than flurbiprofen at inhibiting collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Further in vitro studies using human washed platelets and cells in culture suggest that this is due to the release of NO from Flurbi-NO following the action of (possibly plasma) esterases. Together with our earlier data, these results strongly suggest that Flurbi-NO and other members of this class of drugs, have particular potential as anti-thrombotic agents devoid of gastrointestinal side effects.
A patient developed symptomatic lymphocytic meningitis with hypoglycorrhachia after two intrathecal injections of methylprednisolone acetate. Chills, fever, and confusion occurred ten days after the second injection, and were brief in duration. There were no obvious sequelae. Hypoglycorrhachia secondary to intrathecal steroids has not been previously reported. Steroid-induced chemical meningitis should be considered in any patient who develops CNS symptoms and an abnormal CSF after receiving intrathecal steroids. Obviously, the more common causes of lymphocytic meningitis with or without hypoglycorrhachia must be excluded.
The Arg389Gly polymorphism (Arg389Gly) in the beta1-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB1) has been associated with improvement in left-ventricular remodeling with beta-blocker treatment. One study of risk for heart failure suggested a synergistic effect of ADRB1 Arg389Gly with the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRA2C). We tested whether the ADRA2C insertion/deletion polymorphism was associated with beta-blocker response in heart failure, either alone or in combination with the ADRB1Arg389Gly polymorphism.
Fifty-four beta-blocker naive heart failure patients underwent echocardiography before and after 5-6 months of metoprolol CR/XL therapy. Multivariant linear regression modeling was performed to assess the impact of genotypes and other variables on changes in left-ventricular function in response to metoprolol therapy.
Deletion carriers had a significantly greater negative chronotropic response. Predictors of the end of study ejection fraction were baseline ejection fraction, deletion carrier status and Arg389Arg genotype. Patients with Arg389Arg/Del-carrier status showed the greatest ejection fraction increase with metoprolol CR/XL. Adjusting for baseline ejection fraction, final S-metoprolol plasma concentration and race, final ejection fraction in patients with this genotype combination was significantly higher than all other genotype combination groups.
ADRB1 and ADRA2C polymorphisms synergistically influence the ejection fraction response to beta-blocker therapy of heart failure patients.
A 59-year old female with history of benign ventricular ectopy who developed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) during therapy with procainamide is reported. The tachycardia occurred 24 hours after institution of procainamide without any other evidence of drug toxicity or QT prolongation. When procainamide was withheld, VT resolved completely and no arrhythmia could be induced by programmed ventricular stimulation. When the patient was rechallenged with procainamide at therapeutic level, sustained monomorphic VT was initiated reproducibly by programmed ventricular stimulation. Without antiarrhythmic therapy, patient has been asymptomatic and free of recurrent VT after a follow-up of 9 months. This case: Demonstrates that procainamide may cause the first emergence of sustained monomorphic VT in a patient with no previous history of VT; and Emphasizes the utility of programmed ventricular stimulation in providing direct evidence for drug mediated exacerbation of the ventricular arrhythmia.
A case of a sixty two year old white man with Plasmodium vivax malaria, who has shown chloroquine associated acute cardiac arrhythmia is reported.
The present study was designed to examine the effect of tetrandrine on primary cancer cells isolated from the ascites or pleural fluids of patients with metastatic cancers.
Primary cancer cells were isolated from the pleural fluids (n=13) or ascites (n=21) of patients. Compared with culture cell lines, the response of these cancer cells to tetrandrine and chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in clinical practice were determined by WST-8 assay. Tetrandrine-induced apoptosis in primary cancer cells was determined by Annexin V-FITC assay. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to examine the role of apoptotic associated genes in the anticancer effect of tetrandrine.
The primary cancer cells isolated from effusions showed sensitivity to tetrandrine with IC50 values of 38.23+/-25.77microM, similar to the IC50 in established cell lines. Patients with gastric cancers were more sensitive to tetrandrine than patients with lung cancers (P=0.04). Four cancer cells isolated from effusions were resistant to tetrandrine, which also had increased tolerance to docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. We also observed a weak but significant correlation between sensitivity to tetrandrine and cellular expression of bcl-2 (P=0.035, r=-0.364).
Using cancer cells isolated from the ascites or pleural fluids, this study shows the potential anticancer effect of tetrandrine against primary cancer cells.
Acute deterioration in ventricular function and oxygen transport is common after cardiac surgery. We hypothesized that milrinone or amrinone may reduce their occurrence and catecholamine requirements and increase cellular enzyme levels in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass. In 45 patients, we randomly administered milrinone 50 microg/kg plus 0.5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) infusion for 10 h, amrinone 1.5 mg/kg plus 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) infusion for 10 h, or placebo at release of aortic cross-clamp. Hemodynamic variables, dopamine requirement, and laboratory values were recorded. At the postoperative nadir, stroke volume index was higher in the Milrinone and Amrinone groups (mean +/- SD, 27.8 +/- 4.0 and 26.1 +/- 3.2 vs. 20.4 +/- 5.1 mL x min (-1) x m(-2) per beat, P < 0.0001), and oxygen transport index was higher (354.7 +/- 57.8 and 353.7 +/- 91.2 vs 283.0 +/- 83.9 mL. min(-1) x m(-2), P = 0.009). The postoperative dopamine requirement was less (6.6 +/- 2.7 and 6.8 +/- 2.6 vs 10.4 +/- 2.0 mg/kg, P < 0.008), and postoperative serum lactate, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine kinase, C-reactive protein, and glucose levels were less (P < 0.01). The mean postoperative heart rate was faster in the Milrinone group than in the Amrinone and Placebo groups (96.8 +/- 10.3 vs. 86.9 +/- 9.5 and 87.8 +/- 10.8 bpm, P < 0.01). Milrinone and amrinone administered preemptively reduce postoperative deterioration in cardiac function and oxygen transport, dopamine requirement, and increases in serum lactate, glucose, and enzyme levels, although milrinone may increase heart rate.
Preemptive milrinone or amrinone administration before separation from cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiac surgical patients not only ameliorates postoperative deterioration in cardiac function and oxygen transport, but also reduces dopamine requirement and increases serum lactate, glucose, and cellular enzyme levels, although milrinone may increase heart rate.
Olanzapine is commonly prescribed to patients with schizophrenia. One retrospective study demonstrates the efficacy of physostigmine in reversing mental status changes induced by olanzapine. We report two patients with delirium due to confirmed olanzapine overdose treated with physostigmine. One patient's mental status transiently returned to normal. The other patient completely recovered. CASE 1: A 25-year-old man ingested 300 mg of olanzapine. On presentation, he was agitated, delirious, tachycardic, had dry skin and mucous membranes, and dilated pupils (6 mm) minimally reactive to light. Physostigmine, 0.5 mg, was given intravenously (IV) without effect. Additional physostigmine doses of 1.5 mg IV administered 5 minutes later and then 1 mg IV resulted in the patient having a clear sensorium and normal mentation. The patient's mental status continued to remain normal for the duration of his hospital stay. Olanzapine was identified in the urine by high performance liquid chromatography. CASE 2: A 20-year-old female ingested 600 mg of olanzapine. On presentation, she was tachycardic, obtunded, and minimally responsive to painful stimuli, with decreased bowel sounds, dry skin and dry mucous membranes. Physostigmine, 2 mg, was given IV. Shortly thereafter she regained full consciousness and began speaking coherently. She remained in this condition for approximately 30 minutes, and then became obtunded. Her serum olanzapine concentration was 1230 ng/mL. No further doses of physostigmine were administered. On day 3 of admission her mental status returned to normal.
We report two cases of olanzapine-induced mental status changes treated with physostigmine. The utility of physostigmine as a safe or necessary antidote in the setting of olanzapine overdose remains to be determined.
Mesenchyme Fork Head-1 (MFH-1) is a forkhead (also called winged helix) transcription factor defined by a common 100-amino acid DNA-binding domain. MFH-1 is expressed in non-notochordal mesoderm in the prospective trunk region and in cephalic neural-crest and cephalic mesoderm-derived mesenchymal cells in the prechordal region of early embryos. Subsequently, strong expression is localized in developing cartilaginous tissues, kidney and dorsal aortas. To investigate the developmental roles of MFH-1 during embryogenesis, mice lacking the MFH-1 locus were generated by targeted mutagenesis. MFH-1-deficient mice died embryonically and perinatally, and exhibited interrupted aortic arch and skeletal defects in the neurocranium and the vertebral column. Interruption of the aortic arch seen in the mutant mice was the same as in human congenital anomalies. These results suggest that MFH-1 has indispensable roles during the extensive remodeling of the aortic arch in neural-crest-derived cells and in skeletogenesis in cells derived from the neural crest and the mesoderm.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a cholestatic liver disease of unknown etiology. Although the primary defect affects cholangiocytes, cholestatic injury of hepatocytes may promote further liver damage. Since down-regulation of hepatocellular organic anion transporters is implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of cholestasis, expression of these transporters was determined in a novel rat model, which closely resembles human PSC.
Hepatic protein and mRNA expression of basolateral (Ntcp, Oatp1, 2 and 4) and canalicular (Mrp2, Bsep) organic anion transporters were analyzed 1, 4 and 12 weeks after induction of experimental PSC by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS).
Specific down-regulation of basolateral and canalicular transport systems except Oatp4 and Bsep proteins occurred during the acute phase of inflammation. In chronic cholangitis 12 weeks after TNBS Mrp2 protein and mRNA remained down-regulated by 40-50% of controls (P<0.05). In addition Oatp1 protein was also reduced by 40+/-13% (P<0.05), whereas all other transporters returned to control values.
In chronic cholangitis only canalicular Mrp2 expression remained down-regulated. This might represent the first injury to hepatocytes in chronic cholangitis as an extension of liver injury from the level of cholangiocytes to hepatocytes in PSC.
An 80-yr-old man developed acute hepatitis shortly after ingesting oral ceftriaxone. Although the transaminases gradually returned to baseline after withholding the beta lactam antibiotic, there was a gradual increase in serum bilirubin and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration caused by an autoimmune hemolytic anemia and erythroblastocytopenia. These responded to systemic steroids and immunoglobulins. Despite the widespread use of these agents this triad of side effects has not previously been reported in connection with beta lactam antibiotics.
Evaluation of an outpatient 17 α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) administration programme.
A retrospective analysis of data collected from patients with a history of preterm birth (PTB) and current singleton gestation enrolled between 16.0 and 20.9 weeks' gestational age (GA) for weekly outpatient 17P administration and nursing assessment between 7/2004 and 12/2007 was conducted (n=3139).
The population was mostly white (50.3%), 18-35 years old (77.7%), and married (67.0%). Median GA at 17P initiation and stop was 17.4 (16.0, 20.9) weeks and 35.1 (18.6, 37.4) weeks. Mean injections per patient were 16.5±4.9, at an interval of 7.2 days. Median GA at delivery was 37.3 (18.6, 44.0) weeks. Rate of recurrent spontaneous PTB was 29.8%, with 15.5% and 7.0% with PTB at <35 and <32 weeks.
This represents the largest cohort reported to date of patients prescribed 17P therapy in clinical practice to prevent recurrent spontaneous PTB.
Bcr-Abl fusion protein activates tyrosine kinase, resulting in the proliferation of leukemia cells, especially chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. Imatinib (IM) effectively targets Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, but development of resistance to IM occurs with varying frequency.
Elucidation of the common regulatory pathway upstream of Bcr-Abl in IM-sensitive and IM-resistant CML cells is important for developing novel therapeutics against CML.
This study demonstrated that IM preferentially inhibited the viability and Bcr-Abl expression in IM-sensitive K562 (K562) cells, but not in Bcr-Abl overexpressing IM-resistant K562 (K562R) cells. Both K562 and K562R cells expressed Shh preproprotein, cleaved Shh C-terminal and N-terminal peptides, as well as mRNA level of major Shh signaling molecules, including sonic hedgehog (Shh), patched (PTCH), smoothened (Smo) and Gli-1. Moreover, Gli-1 translocation into nucleus was evident in these two cell lines, suggesting that both K562 and K562R cells possess activated and major components of the Shh signaling pathway. Silencing of Gli-1 by interference RNA was accompanied by inhibition of Bcr-Abl protein expression. Pharmacological suppression of Bcr-Abl expression was restored by the Smo agonist purmorpharmine. Treatment of Shh peptide in both K562 and K562R cells not only increased Shh and Gli-1 expression, but also up-regulated Bcr-Abl expression. Resveratrol, a known Bcr-Abl inhibitor, reduced Gli-1 activation and inhibited the viability of CML cells.
Shh signaling may regulate Bcr-Abl expression in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Novel compounds inhibiting both Shh signaling and Bcr-Abl expression, such as resveratrol, may have potential to be effective agents against CML independent of IM resistance.
