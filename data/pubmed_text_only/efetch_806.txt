Methotrexate has multiple therapeutic uses in women of reproductive age including treatment for ectopic pregnancy, neoplastic disease, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory conditions. More frequent use of methotrexate may result in an increased number of exposures in pregnant women and their fetuses.
A 16-year-old gravida 1, para 0 used oral methotrexate treatment of 7.5 mg per day for psoriasis for 2 days at 3.5 weeks postconception. Multiple anomalies were noted on an 18-week ultrasound. Fetopsy revealed craniofacial, axial skeletal, cardiopulmonary, and gastrointestinal abnormalities.
A minimal, low-dose, brief exposure to methotrexate in the first trimester resulted in a fetus with multiple internal and external malformations. Some of the anomalies (craniofacial and skeletal) have been previously reported with first- trimester methotrexate exposure. This case depicts the association of cardiopulmonary and gastrointestinal abnormalities with methotrexate exposure.
The use of methotrexate is associated with the risk of numerous, sometimes life-threatening, side effects. We describe a 76-year-old female patient treated with methotrexate (MTX) due to vertebral joint disease of unknown etiology. During the outpatient therapy, which was not conformed to doctor's recommendations, acute liver failure and symptoms of bone marrow damage developed. Despite intensive hospital treatment, the patient died.
A 65-year-old female patient with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) developed aplastic anemia following treatment with temozolomide. Following her diagnosis of GBM, the patient received standard treatment with surgery, concomitant radiation therapy and temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide. On day 14 of her adjuvant treatment, she developed profound fatigue and spontaneous bruising and was noted to be severely pancytopenic. After an extensive workup, she was found to have aplastic anemia on bone marrow bipsy. Further studies did not reveal any other etiology and she was not on any other medications known to cause aplastic anemia. There have been two previously published cases involving aplastic anemia due to temozolomide. This case represents a rare but potentially fatal toxicity from temozolomide.
The thresholds for pentylenetetrazol and lidocaine-induced clonic convulsions were significantly influenced by manipulation of brain biogenic amines. Pretreatment with inhibitors of monoamine synthesis, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine and p-chlorophenylalanine, caused significant decreases in brain monoamine contents and pentylenetetrazol seizure threshold, while the threshold for lidocaine-induced convulsions was significantly increased by either treatment. Moreover, the inhibitor of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, disulfiram, caused significant decrease in brain noradrenaline (NA) and significant increase in brain dopamine (DA) contents. The threshold for pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions was decreased by treatment with disulfiram, while that of lidocaine was increased by the same treatment. Furthermore, treatment with L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) caused significant increase in brain DA contents, while 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) treatment caused significant increase in brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) contents, but the thresholds for lidocaine and pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions were not influenced by either treatment. These results may suggest that the brain monoaminergic systems, different from their ability to inhibit control of pentylenetetrazol seizures, act to potentiate lidocaine-induced convulsions.
The authors report the case of a 77-year-old woman suffering from ischemic cardiopathy, arterial hypertension and NID diabetes mellitus who was hospitalised for diabetic retinopathy. Following the topical administration of a drop of phenylephrine in the right eye, in preparation for fluoroangiography, she suffered an attack of angina pectoris. This event was clearly identified by a ECG carried out at the time which highlighted the sublevelling of the ST tract in the precordial derivations V2-V5, and by ecocardiographic imaging that showed septo-apical, anterior-apical and anterior-median transient segmentary hypokinesia. This case underlines the need for prudence and emphasises the need to regard patients suffering from ischemic cardiopathy as high-risk when undergoing diagnostic tests, in particular if these involve the use of vasoactive drugs.
The aim of this study was to compare the degree of striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability in patients treated with recommended (5-20 mg, mean dose 11.9 +/- 6.3 mg daily) and higher doses (25-40 mg, mean 32.1 +/- 5.6 mg daily) of the novel antipsychotic drug olanzapine by means of [123I] IBZM Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The results were compared to those of a group of 10 untreated, healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. The degree of dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in the patient group was correlated with the presence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). A total of 20 patients who met the DSM III R criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder received a clinically effective antipsychotic monotherapy with olanzapine. The mean daily dose of olanzapine ranged from 0.05-0.6 mg/kg body weight. The dopamine D2 receptor binding was reduced in all patients treated with olanzapine. Specific IBZM binding expressed as the [STR-BKG]/BKG ratio ranged from 0.13-0.61 (healthy controls 0.95). The D2 receptor availability revealed an exponential dose-response relationship (r = - 0.85, p < 0.001). The frequency of EPS induced by olanzapine was considerably lower. Only one patient, treated with 40 mg olanzapine, suffered from severe EPS symptoms and had to be given biperiden. There were no significant differences in the presence of EPS symptoms between patients with recommended doses and those with higher doses of olanzapine.
Influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE) is characterized by persistently high fever, febrile convulsions, severe brain edema and high mortality. We reported previously that a large proportion of patients with disabling or fatal IAE exhibit a thermolabile phenotype of compound variants for [1055T>G/F352C] and [1102G>A/V368I] of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) and mitochondrial energy crisis during high fever. In the present study, we studied the effect of bezafibrate, a hypolipidemic pan-agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), on CPT II expression and mitochondrial energy metabolism in fibroblasts of IAE patients and wild type (WT) fibroblasts from a healthy volunteer at 37°C and 41°C. Although heat stress markedly upregulated CPT II, CPT IA and PPAR-δ mRNA expression levels, CPT II activity, β-oxidation and ATP levels in WT and IAE fibroblasts at 41°C were paradoxically downregulated probably due to the thermal instability of the corresponding enzymes. Bezafibrate significantly enhanced the expression levels of the above mRNAs and cellular functions of these enzymes in fibroblasts at 37°C. Bezafibrate-induced increase in CPT II activity also tended to restore the downregulated ATP levels, though moderately, and improved mitochondrial membrane potential even at 41°C to the levels at 37°C in fibroblasts of IAE patients. L-carnitine, a substrate of CPT II, boosted the effects of bezafibrate on cellular ATP levels in WT and IAE fibroblasts, even in severe IAE fibroblasts with thermolabile compound variations of F352C+V368I at 37°C and 41°C. The results suggest the potential usefulness of bezafibrate for the treatment of IAE.
Two patients with a bipolar disorder, a woman aged 56 and a woman aged 68, who had used lithium for more than 30 years, were seen with side effects from this medication. Both patients were treated by their general practitioner and had not visited a psychiatrist for many years. The first patient had a chronic lithium intoxication with cerebellar signs and eventually coma, diabetes insipidus, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism and psoriasis. After 6 weeks of treatment in the intensive-care unit she made a good recovery. The second patient had several lithium side effects. She was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus, hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma, hypothyroidism and a sick-sinus syndrome. A pacemaker was implanted 4 years earlier. The adenoma was surgically removed. After other medication was tried, the patient was once again given lithium, on which she was able to function well. The first patient had lithium concentrations above the therapeutic value for several years and both patients experienced a delay before their signs and symptoms were attributed to lithium. Lithium treatment should be monitored by an experienced psychiatrist.
Cardiotoxicity is a potentially life-threatening consequence of treatment with doxorubicin. Without reliable predictive or monitoring tests for early intervention, preventive methods are warranted. This study tested the hypothesis that a 1-hour infusion of doxorubicin would reduce the incidence of cardiotoxicity compared with historical incidences. Inclusion criteria for this retrospective trial were a minimum of three doses of doxorubicin administered as a 1-hour infusion in patients with at least two echocardiographic or electrocardiographic examinations during the course of treatment (median cumulative dose, 120 mg/m2). Of 133 dogs, 16 (12%) developed electrocardiographic abnormalities during or after treatment, which was statistically lower than the historical incidence of 17.7% (31 of 175 dogs). Only seven dogs (5.3%) developed abnormalities during the course of therapy. Three (2%) developed congestive heart failure.
1. Estrogens have been shown to decrease the effect of apomorphine in a variety of animal behavioral models reflecting the sensitivity of striatal and mesolimbic dopamine receptors. 2. These include circling, and locomotor activity, in rats and suppression of midbrain tremor as well as lingual dyskinesia in monkeys. 3. Estradiol also increases the haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. Moreover estradiol increases 3H spiroperidol specific binding in the rat striatum and potentiates the increase caused by haloperidol or denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine. 4. These findings point to an action of estradiol similar to a week neuroleptic. 5. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone when injected into the head of the caudate nucleus in cats induces a head turning response which may be ipsilateral or contralateral depending upon the injection site. The response is similar to the effect of dopamine injected into the same site. 6. The effect of dopamine but not that of TRH is blocked by prior administration of haloperidol indicating that although TRH has a dopamine-like action in the caudate nucleus, it is not mediated via the dopamine terminals or the dopamine receptors.
Animal data demonstrate associations of dioxin, furan, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures with altered male gonadal maturation. It is unclear whether these associations apply to human populations.
We investigated the association of dioxins, furans, PCBs, and corresponding toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations with pubertal onset among boys in a dioxin-contaminated region.
Between 2003 and 2005, 499 boys 8-9 years of age were enrolled in a longitudinal study in Chapaevsk, Russia. Pubertal onset [stage 2 or higher for genitalia (G2+) or testicular volume (TV) > 3 mL] was assessed annually between ages 8 and 12 years. Serum levels at enrollment were analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess age at pubertal onset as a function of exposure adjusted for potential confounders. We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding boys with pubertal onset at enrollment.
The median (range) total serum TEQ concentration was 21 (4-175) pg/g lipid, approximately three times higher than values in European children. At enrollment, boys were generally healthy and normal weight (mean body mass index, 15.9 kg/m2), with 30% having entered puberty by G2+ and 14% by TV criteria. Higher dioxin TEQs were associated with later pubertal onset by TV (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.95 for the highest compared with the lowest quartile). Similar associations were observed for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and dioxin concentrations for TV but not G2+. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses.
Findings support an association of higher peripubertal serum dioxin TEQs and concentrations with later male pubertal onset reflected in delayed testicular maturation.
Methylmercury (MeHg) exposure from occupational, environmental, and food sources is a significant threat to public health. MeHg poisonings in adults may result in severe psychological and neurological deficits, and in utero exposures can confer embryonic defects and developmental delays. Recent epidemiological and vertebrate studies suggest that MeHg exposure may also contribute to dopamine (DA) neuron vulnerability and the propensity to develop Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we describe a Caenorhabditis elegans model of MeHg toxicity that shows that low, chronic exposure confers embryonic defects, developmental delays, decreases in brood size and animal viability, and DA neuron degeneration. Toxicant exposure results in the robust induction of the glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) gst-4 and gst-38 that are largely dependent on the PD-associated phase II antioxidant transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2. We also demonstrate that the expression of SKN-1, a protein previously localized to a small subset of chemosensory neurons and intestinal cells in the nematode, is also expressed in the DA neurons, and a reduction in SKN-1 gene expression increases MeHg-induced animal vulnerability and DA neuron degeneration. These studies recapitulate fundamental hallmarks of MeHg-induced mammalian toxicity, identify a key molecular regulator of toxicant-associated whole-animal and DA neuron vulnerability, and suggest that the nematode will be a useful in vivo tool to identify and characterize mediators of MeHg-induced developmental and DA neuron pathologies.
Clopidogrel decreases the morbidity and mortality associated with several cardiovascular diseases. However, clopidogrel is a prodrug that needs to be metabolized to the active thiol metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. This activation is a source of significant interindividual variability in clopidogrel responsiveness. Drug interactions with and genetic variation in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C19 enzymes have been implicated in decreasing active metabolite production. In addition, polymorphisms in the genes encoding P-glycoprotein (an efflux transporter) and purinergic receptor P2Y(12) (the active site for clopidogrel) have been studied for their role in clopidogrel responsiveness. Several large studies have recently assessed the role of genetic variation in clopidogrel responsiveness as characterized by clinical outcomes. In this review, we summarize the genetic causes of clopidogrel nonresponsiveness, with a focus on larger outcomes-based studies. A MEDLINE search of the English-language literature (1990-2008) was conducted to identify studies that examined these relationships; additional citations were obtained from the articles retrieved from the literature search. Polymorphisms in CYP2C19 and, to a lesser extent, the adenosine 5'-triphosphate-binding cassette gene, ABCB1, contribute to variability in clopidogrel responsiveness. Specifically, patients possessing at least one variant CYP2C19 allele (CYP2C19*2, *3) have impaired clopidogrel responsiveness due to decreased formation of the active metabolite. In addition, one study found that considering ABCB1 genotype in addition to CYP2C19 allowed better prediction of clopidogrel nonresponsiveness. However, routine genotyping for CYP2C19 or ABCB1 polymorphisms in order to predict clopidogrel responsiveness cannot be recommended at this time because of logistic and cost considerations.
Progressive hepatolenticular degeneration, or Wilson's disease, is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Knowledge of the clinical presentations and treatment of the disease are important both to the generalist and to specialists in gastroenterology and hepatology, neurology, psychiatry, and paediatrics. Wilson's disease invariably results in severe disability and death if untreated. The diagnosis is easily overlooked but if discovered early, effective treatments are available that will prevent or reverse many manifestations of this disorder. Studies have identified the role of copper in disease pathogenesis and clinical, biochemical, and genetic markers that can be useful in diagnosis. There are several chelating agents and zinc salts for medical therapy. Liver transplantation corrects the underlying pathophysiology and can be lifesaving. The discovery of the Wilson's disease gene has opened up a new molecular diagnostic approach, and could form the basis of future gene therapy.
Scleroderma with typical migraine headaches occurred in 16 well-documented cases observed over a 25-year period. Although the number of cases is within the expected range of coincidence of both diseases, in 13 of the 16 patients the scleroderma developed after 15 years or more of therapy with ergot or methysergide preparations. Eleven of the 13 patients had Raynaud's vasospastic phenomenon as part of their systemic scleroderma. The vascular pathology of scleroderma, Raynaud's phenomenon, and ergotism is similar enough to suggest caution in the administration of these drugs to patients with migraine and extra caution in observing for signs of Raynaud's phenomenon or early vascular scleroderma.
Torsades de points (Tdp) is a form of ventricular tachycardia, and its occurrence in childhood is very rare. In adult patients treated with sotalol, Tdp has been reported to the occur with an incidence of 2%-4%. In children who are treated with sotalol, occurrence of Tdp has been reported in only a single case. A 15-month-old girl with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome developed recurrent syncopal attacks. She had been treated with sotalol 1.5 mg/kg daily since shortly after birth because of recurrent episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. ECG monitoring exhibited frequent Tdp tachycardia. Serum electrolyte levels were normal. Echocardiographic analysis excluded a structural heart defect and did not show any signs of myocardial infection. Sotalol treatment was stopped and an infusion with lidocaine was started. Despite this therapy the Tdp continued. Magnesium aspartate was then administered, which immediately stopped the Tdp. As no other reason was evident, Tdp in this child has to be judged as a proarrhythmia related to sotalol therapy.
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a growing concern in the fields of drug development and clinical drug therapy because numerous drugs have been linked to hepatotoxicity. However, it is difficult to predict DILI in humans due to the lack of experimental animal models. Although azathioprine (AZA), which is a widely used immunosuppressive drug, is generally well tolerated, a small number of patients prescribed AZA develop severe hepatitis. However, the mechanism underlying this process has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we developed a mouse model of AZA-induced liver injury and investigated the mechanisms responsible for the hepatotoxicity of AZA. Female BALB/c mice were orally administered AZA. After AZA administration, the plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were increased, and liver damage was confirmed through a histological evaluation. In addition, the hepatic glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activity were significantly decreased. The plasma levels of reactive oxygen species were significantly increased during the early phase of AZA-induced liver injury, and the hepatic mRNA levels of immune- and inflammation-related factors were also significantly changed. In conclusion, oxidative stress and the subsequently activated immune- and inflammation-related factors are involved in AZA-induced liver injury.
Both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and hypoxia are vital physiological factors involved in the control of nephrogenesis and vascularization. We investigated the relationship between RAAS and hypoxia in the developing kidney. The expression of VEGF and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 related with the oxygen was analyzed in the enalapril- or spironolactone-treated neonatal rat kidneys. Enalapril (30 mg/kg/d) or spironolactone (200 mg/kg/d) was administered to newborn rat pups for 7 d. The newborn rats were injected i.p. with pimonidazole (200 mg/kg), a marker of severe tissue hypoxia, 1 h before killing. VEGF and HO-1 protein expression was significantly increased by immunoblots and immunohistochemistry in both the enalapril- and spironolactone-treated kidneys, compared with the controls (p < 0.05). HO-1 mRNA expression was increased in the spironolactone-treated group (p < 0.05). The immunoactivity of pimonidazole was not different from that of the controls in the enalapril-treated group, whereas it was increased in the spironolactone-treated group. The results of this study indicate that aldosterone blockade or angiotensin II inhibition in the developing rat kidney up-regulated renal VEGF and HO-1 expression regardless of the hypoxic conditions and may differentially modulate VEGF and HO-1 production.
K-ras point mutation at codon 12 has a relationship greater than 90% with pancreatic cancer. Cancer therapy should also include the treatment of metastatic disease because it is known that the properties of metastatic cells may vary considerably from those of the primary tumor.
To clarify if the same drugs, which can inhibit the tumor growth in the parental cell line, can inhibit the pancreatic metastatic and remetastatic cell lines at the same concentrations and to compare the inhibition with antisense oligonucleotides mismatched to K-ras gene, in Syrian golden hamsters.
HaP-T1, a BHP-induced hamster pancreatic cancer cell line, MS-PaS-1 (a metastatic cell line established from "return trip" metastases from the liver to the pancreas) and MS-PaS-2 named as a "remetastatic cell line", i.e., metastases from MS-PaS-1 were used. MTT and MTT-agarose assays were performed, using 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Mitomycin C (MMC) and antisense oligonucleotide specific to K-ras oncogene.
The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5-FU, which inhibited HaP-T1, had to be increased by 50-fold to inhibit MS-PaS-1 and 100-fold to inhibit MS-PaS-2. MMC had to be increased by 10-fold to inhibit MS-PaS-1 and 50-fold to inhibit MS-PaS-2. However, IC50 was the same when antisense oligonucleotide was tried in these 3 cell lines.
Antisense oligonucleotide-targeted K-ras gene may be a good choice for therapy because it could inhibit the growth in metastatic and remetastatic cells as well as in primary tumor cells.
