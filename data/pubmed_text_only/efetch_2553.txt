Evidence has indicated that endothelin-1 is related to the pathogenesis of hypertension. To characterize the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the development of pulmonary hypertension syndrome in broilers, the blockade effect of ETA receptor (ET(A)) antagonist, BQ123, on blood pressure in experimental models of pulmonary hypertension was examined. Birds were locally anesthetized and instrumented with venous catheters for pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and right ventricular pressure (RVP), followed by packed cell volume (PCV) and Ascites heart index (AHI) measured, after exposed to low ambient temperature for 7 or 14 d. In treated groups, BQ123 (0.4 or 2.0 microg each time, 2 times a day), administered in abdominal cavities for 7 or 14 d during birds kept in low ambient temperature, prevented both PAP and RVP increasing, especially the high dose BQ123 lowered PAP and RVP to normotensive levels as that in control under normal temperature, whereas significant increases (p<0.05) were found in the two parameters of broilers in both untreated and saline treated group under low ambient temperature compared with those of birds in control. Furthermore, there was also a reduction in low ambient temperature-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in the groups administered BQ123. The preventive effect of BQ123 suggests that ET-1 is associated with the development of broilers' pulmonary hypertension, which leads to the development of ascites, and BQ123 can prevent the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension.
Therapeutic hypothermia is an exciting new treatment modality that has been shown to have significantly improved outcomes in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. One of the exclusion criteria of the landmark studies on therapeutic hypothermia was a potential toxin-induced cause of the persistent comatose state and presumably of the cardiac arrest itself. We present the first reported case of a comatose survivor of cocaine-induced cardiac arrest successfully treated with therapeutic hypothermia.
The incidence of candiduria is increasing in teaching hospitals. We examined the hypothesis that this trend was correlated with the amount of departmental antibiotic consumption. In the setting of a large teaching hospital in Israel, the correlation coefficient between departmental intravenous antibiotic consumption (expressed as daily defined dose (DDD)/1000 patient-days) and the incidence of candiduria per 1000 patient-days was 0.47 (P=0.03). For broad-spectrum antibiotics, the corresponding correlation coefficient was 0.66 (P=0.001). The strongest correlation with candiduria was shown for the use of meropenem (r=0.79, P<0.001) and ceftazidime (r=0.66, P=0.001). This is the first time that departmental habits of antibiotic use have been shown to be strongly correlated with the incidence of candiduria in hospitalized patients. These results add an important new dimension to the strategy of restricting broad-spectrum antibiotics.
In this study, 147 smokers were randomly assigned to receive either venlafaxine or placebo in conjunction with behavioral counseling (9 weekly sessions) and transdermal nicotine replacement therapy (22 mg/day). Patients began medication 2 weeks before quitting and continued for 18 weeks after quitting, with the daily dose titrated from 150 to 225 mg. in response to symptoms of negative affect and relapse. The results showed no main effect of treatment on abstinence. Post hoc analysis revealed that both at the end of treatment and at the 1-year follow-up smokers consuming less than a pack of cigarettes a day benefited from the addition of venlafaxine to the treatment regimen. Venlafaxine also reduced negative affect for all smokers for up to 6 weeks postcessation. The findings suggest that venlafaxine could have some role to play in the treatment of lighter smokers, in addition to the expected benefits of nicotine replacement therapy and behavioral counseling.
Inhaled corticosteroids are most effective drugs currently available for the treatment of bronchial asthma. They have been shown to reduce airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. The aim of this study was to assess the preventive effect of inhaled steroid therapy in seasonal asthma. In a double-blind study, two groups of 10 allergic asthmatics were randomly assigned to receive inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), 500 micrograms b.i.d., or a matched placebo, two puffs b.i.d. The patients used inhaled salbutamol as needed. At the beginning of the study, and every month between February and June, the following parameters were assessed: lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1); airway responsiveness (provocative dose of methacholine producing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (PD20)), serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP); and blood eosinophil count. All subjects recorded daily asthma symptoms, beta 2-agonist consumption and peak expiratory flow (PEF) values. In the placebo group, all parameters except FEV1 worsened significantly during the pollen season compared with preseasonal values (p < 0.001). BDP produced complete protection, although a slight change from baseline was found for symptom score (p < 0.01), beta 2-agonist consumption (p < 0.01), and eosinophil number (p < 0.05) in May, when the pollen load was highest. These data provide evidence that beclomethasone dipropionate treatment is able to inhibit the seasonal changes occurring during natural exposure in asthmatics. This preventive effect is probably due to the anti-inflammatory action of beclamethasone dipropionate, as documented by its effect on serum markers of airway inflammation.
After receiving 90 mg of haloperidol and 100 mg of chlorpromazine hydrochloride within 25 hours, a 29-year-old man was found to have neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), characterized by the acute onset of hyperpyrexia, extreme muscular rigidity, autonomic instability, and coma. Subsequently, rhabdomyolysis developed, with myoglobinuric renal failure and bilateral anterior tibial compartment syndromes. The patient's initial neuroleptic levels were in the therapeutic and nontoxic ranges. He was treated with supportive measures and his clinical improvement was paralleled by decreased neuroleptic levels, a return toward normal of an elevated prolactin level, and an increased responsiveness to a dopamine hydrochloride infusion. This supports an association between NMS and dopamine receptor blockade.
Many patients complain of venous pain or develop phlebitis following treatment with epirubicin hydrochloride(EPI). To ensure effective and safe treatment with this drug, it is essential to deal with the adverse events associated with it appropriately. At our hospital, EPI was previously administered by drip infusion(diluted with 50mL of physiological saline)over 15 minutes after pretreatment(EPI main route). With this method of treatment, venous pain and phlebitis developed in 14 of 15 cases. In 3 of these 14 cases, the regimen was modified. Following this experience, EPI administration was switched to drip infusion from the fully-opened side tube used for pretreatment(EPI sub-route). Switching to this route resulted in a sharp decrease in the incidence of venous pain and phlebitis, to only 1 of 15 cases. Stimulation of vascular tunica intima by EPI has been considered a factor principally responsible for the venous pain and phlebitis seen after EPI therapy. To prevent these adverse reactions, it is necessary to modify the method of administration so that strong or long-term exposure of blood vessels to EPI can be reduced. The results of this study suggest that the EPI sub-route we devised is useful in achieving this goal.
In the current study, we explored the role of TNF cluster cytokines on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated, synergistic increase in brain injury after hypoxic ischemic insult in postnatal day 7 mice. Pretreatment with moderate doses of LPS (0.3 μg/g) resulted in particularly pronounced synergistic injury within 12 h. Systemic application of LPS alone resulted in a strong upregulation of inflammation-associated cytokines TNFα, LTβ, interleukin (IL) 1β, IL6, chemokines, such as CXCL1, and adhesion molecules E-Selectin, P-Selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), as well as a trend toward increased LTα levels in day 7 mouse forebrain. In addition, it was also associated with strong activation of brain blood vessel endothelia and local microglial cells. Here, deletion of the entire TNF gene cluster, removing TNFα, LTβ and LTα completely abolished endotoxin-mediated increase in the volume of cerebral infarct. Interestingly, the same deletion also prevented endothelial and microglial activation following application of LPS alone, suggesting the involvement of these cell types in bringing about the LPS-mediated sensitization to neonatal brain injury.
Three patients with pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (PSLE) and autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AT), who developed unacceptable side effects (pseudotumor cerebri, hypertension, excessive weight gain) from treatment with steroids, were treated successfully with vincristine (2 patients) or intravenous immunoglobulin (1 patient). All patients remained off steroids without any complications for 11 to 23 months.
To investigate the effects of 12 monthly average air pollution levels on monthly prevalence of respiratory morbidity, the authors examined retrospective questionnaire data on 2034 4th-grade children from 12 Southern California communities that were enrolled in The Children's Health Study. Wheezing during the spring and summer months was associated with community levels of airborne particulate matter with a diameter < or = 10 microm (PM10) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.46-5.80), but was not associated with community levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, PM2.5 (diameter < or = 2.5), nitric acid, or formic acid. Logistic regression was performed on data stratified into two seasonal groups, spring/summer and fall/winter. Among asthmatics, the monthly prevalence of asthma medication use was associated with monthly levels of ozone, nitric acid, and acetic acid (OR = 1.80 [95%CI = 1.19-2.70]; OR = 1.80 [95%CI = 1.23-2.65]; OR = 1.57 [95% CI = 1.11-2.21]; respectively). Asthma medication use was more prevalent among children who spent more time outdoors--with consequential exposure to ozone--than among children who spent more time indoors (OR = 3.07 [95%CI = 1.61-5.86]; OR = 1.31 [95%CI = 0.47-2.71]; respectively). The authors concluded that monthly variations in some ambient air pollutants were associated with monthly respiratory morbidity among school children.
To describe 3 cases of hypertriglyceridemia associated with the use of interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) for the treatment of malignant melanoma and propose a management plan for dyslipidemia associated with interferon therapy.
Three case reports of hypertriglyceridemia with or without elevation of total cholesterol level associated with the use of adjuvant IFN-alpha for the treatment of malignant melanoma are described. These patients received IFN-alpha-based adjuvant therapy with doses ranging from 5-20 million units/m(2) for 1-2 years' duration. The onset and severity of dyslipidemia appeared to occur randomly. Pre-existing cardiovascular disorders did not seem to play a role. The patients were treated with atorvastatin, gemfibrozil, and a combination of lovastatin with niacin, depending on their lipid panel results.
Based on our case reports and published data, hypertriglyceridemia is more frequently associated with longer duration of interferon therapy, although the time of onset is not clearly defined. Presence or absence of baseline dyslipidemia does not seem to play a role in the development of hypertriglyceridemia associated with interferon, and its occurrence and severity are not dependent on the dose. Lifestyle modifications should be encouraged in patients who develop dyslipidemia, and drug treatment should be considered. If drug therapy is indicated, fibric acid derivatives should be considered as first-line therapy. Even at lower doses, this class of drug seems to be effective in managing severe triglyceride elevations in these patients. The Naranjo probability scale of these cases ranged from possible to probable.
Hypertriglyceridemia is a rare but potentially severe adverse consequence of interferon therapy. Patients with malignant melanoma who develop dyslipidemia while receiving interferon should be considered for antidyslipidemic management.
A new cholinesteras reactivator--chlorohydrate of S-diethylaminoethyl ether p-bromo benzoylthiohydroxime acid (diethixime), containing a tertiary nitrogen atom in the molecule, was shown to produce a central effect in a dose of 20 mg/kg--1/50 LD50--in contrast to diproxime in a dose of 3 mg/kg, containing a quarternary nitrogen atom, under intoxication of albino rats and rabbits with dimethyl-dichlorynylphosphate. This effect was confirmed by the restortion of the cholinesterase activity in different parts of the rabbit brain, by the normalization of the EEGand of the functional stateof motor neurons of the rat spinal cord.
The authors report the case of a 51-year-old man with a history of trichloroethylene (TCE) poisoning. He was treated by radical nephrectomy after discovery ofa right renal mass corresponding to renal cell carcinoma. The objective of this study is to discuss the role of TCE abuse as a renal carcinogen. TCE is an excellent solvent used to degrease metal parts. It can enter the body by inhalation, ingestion or cutaneous contact, but the respiratory tract is the main route of absorption of TCE. Many epidemiological studies have been conducted on workers exposed to TCE, but they have not been able to clearly establish a link between exposure by inhalation to TCE and cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has accumulated sufficient evidence to consider TCE to be carcinogenic to animals and considers that TCE is probably carcinogenic to humans. Toxic metabolites derived from TCE induce chronic renal tubular lesions and may exert a genotoxic effect on the proximal convoluted tubule. The initial genotoxic effect appears to be related to mutations of the VHL suppressor gene. The chronic toxic effects and the possible role of TCE in the development of cancer have not been specifically studied in the context of TCE abuse behaviour. To our knowledge, this is the first case of renal cell carcinoma reported in a TCE addict.
To determine the risk factors and evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with antenatal cocaine use.
This was a retrospective case-control study of 200 cocaine-exposed maternal-neonatal pairs and 200 controls from 1991 to 2000.
Cocaine-using mothers tended to be older, African American, multiparous and incarcerated and they utilized less prenatal care. However, 79% of Hispanics abusing cocaine were primarily English speaking. Cocaine use correlated with syphilis (36 vs. 1%, p = 0.000) and premature rupture of membranes (23 vs. 0%, p = 0.000), fetal demise (5 vs. 0%, p = 0.004), preterm delivery (40 vs. 6%, p = 0.000). Cocaine-exposed infants delivered earlier (36 vs. 39 weeks, p = 0.000), had lower birth weights (2660 vs. 3305 g, p = 0.000), more respiratory distress syndrome (14 vs. 4%, p = 0.001), congenital syphilis (12 vs. 1%, p = 0.000) and longer hospital stays (10 vs. 3 days, p = 0.000); 75% were placed in foster care or adoption and 37.5% had neonatal withdrawal syndrome. There was a stronger positive correlation between neonatal withdrawal and maternal urine toxicology (rho = 0.443, p = 0.000) than with neonatal urine screen (rho = 0.278, p = 0.003).
Cocaine use in pregnancy is associated with acculturation, lack of prenatal care, and significant social and obstetric complications resulting in increased neonatal morbidity secondary to prematurity, congenital infection and withdrawal syndrome.
Liver X receptor (LXR) has been identified as a potential target for treatment of atherosclerosis and diabetes. Activation of LXR, however, is associated with increased lipogenesis and fat accumulation in the liver. The objective of the current study was to examine the effect of resveratrol on LXR activator-induced fat accumulation in liver using mice as an animal model. Three groups of C57BL/6 mice were studied. Animals in group 1 were treated with T0901317, a potent activator of LXR in mice. Animals in group 2 served as the control and were treated with carrier solution and those in group 3 were treated with T0901317/resveratrol combination. Using histochemical and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that resveratrol treatment significantly suppressed fat accumulation in the liver induced by T0901317. In addition, resveratrol completely blocked elevation of blood levels of triglyceride and cholesterol and reduced blood glucose level. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that resveratrol treatment did not change the mRNA levels of abca1, abcg1, cyp7a1, srebp-1c, chrebp, and acc genes compared to that of animals treated with T0901317 alone but reduced pepck and g6p gene expressions. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses show resveratrol treatment activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increased phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Treatment with T0901317 on hepatocytes increased intracellular fat accumulation and this increase was suppressed by resveratrol; the suppressive effect of resveratrol was greatly repressed by Compound C which is an inhibitor of AMPK. Collectively, these data suggest that resveratrol blocks T0901317-induced lipid accumulation in the liver and can be considered for inclusion into the treatment of diseases involving activation of liver X receptor.
The narcotic antagonist, naltrexone, was studied in 242 patients during a 6-year period. Although a large number of subjects discontinued naltrexone abruptly, treatment was related to a significant decrease in opiate and nonopiate drug use. Methods for improving retention during induction and maintenance are discussed and posttreatment outcome results are presented. The authors conclude that naltrexone may be a useful short-term treatment option for opiate dependence.
Short-term changes in levels of fine ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) may increase the risk of acute ischemic stroke; however, results from prior studies have been inconsistent. We examined this hypothesis using data from a multicenter prospective stroke registry.
We analyzed data from 9202 patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke, having a documented date and time of stroke onset, and residing within 50 km of a PM2.5 monitor in 8 cities in Ontario, Canada. We evaluated the risk of ischemic stroke onset associated with PM2.5 in each city using a time-stratified case-crossover design, matching on day of week and time of day. We then combined these city-specific estimates using random-effects meta-analysis techniques. We examined whether the effects of PM2.5 differed across strata defined by patient characteristics and ischemic stroke etiology.
Overall, PM2.5 was associated with a -0.7% change in ischemic stroke risk per 10-μg/m increase in PM2.5 (95% confidence interval = -6.3% to 5.1%). These overall negative results were robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. Among patients with diabetes mellitus, PM2.5 was associated with an 11% increase in ischemic stroke risk (1% to 22%). The association between PM2.5 and ischemic stroke risk varied according to stroke etiology, with the strongest associations observed for strokes due to large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel occlusion.
These results do not support the hypothesis that short-term increases in PM2.5 levels are associated with ischemic stroke risk overall. However, specific patient subgroups may be at increased risk of particulate-related ischemic strokes.
Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a nonneuropathic inhibitor of neurotoxic esterase (NTE), is a known potentiator of organophosphorus-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN). The ability of PMSF posttreatment (90 mg/kg, sc, 4 hr after the last PSP injection) to modify development of delayed neurotoxicity was examined in 2-, 5-, and 8-week-old White Leghorn chickens treated either one, two, or three times (doses separated by 24 hr) with the neuropathic OP compound phenyl saligenin phosphate (PSP, 5 mg/kg, sc). NTE activity was measured in the cervical spinal cord 4 hr after the last PSP treatment. Development of delayed neurotoxicity was measured over a 16-day postexposure period. All PSP-treated groups exhibited > 97% NTE inhibition regardless of age or number of OP treatments. Two-week-old birds did not develop clinical signs of neurotoxicity in response to either single or repeated OP treatment regimens nor following subsequent treatment with PMSF. Five-week-old birds were resistant to the clinical effects of a single PSP exposure and were minimally affected by repeated doses. PMSF posttreatment, however, significantly amplified the clinical effects of one, two, or three doses of PSP. A single exposure to PSP induced slight to moderate signs of delayed neurotoxicity in 8-week-old birds with more extensive neurotoxicity being noted following repeated dosing. As with 5-week-old birds, PMSF exacerbated the clinical signs of neurotoxicity when given after one, two, or three doses of PSP in 8-week-old birds. Axonal degeneration studies supported the clinical findings: PMSF posttreatment did not influence the degree of degeneration in 2-week-old chickens but resulted in more severe degeneration (relative to PSP only exposure) in cervical cords from both 5- and 8-week-old birds. The results indicate that PMSF does not alter the progression of delayed neurotoxicity in very young (2 weeks of age) chickens but potentiates PSP-induced delayed neurotoxicity in the presence of 0-3% residual NTE activity in older animals. We conclude that posttreatment with neuropathic or nonneuropathic NTE inhibitors, following virtually complete NTE inhibition by either single or repeated doses of a neuropathic agent in sensitive age groups, can modify both the clinical and morphological indices of delayed neurotoxicity. This study further supports the hypothesis that potentiation of OPIDN occurs through a mechanism unrelated to NTE.
A two-stage model of hepatocarcinogenesis is used to study the effect of exposure time to ethinyl estradiol (EE) on promotion of preneoplastic lesions in rat liver induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Young male and female Sprague-Dawley rats initiated by a single dose of DEN (100 mg/kg) were subjected to different times of EE administration incorporated into the diet at 10 p.p.m. (0.5 mg/kg x day). Animals were killed 1 year after initiation. Whereas macroscopic tumours were rarely seen in animals with short exposure (3 or 4 months) or in only-initiated controls, all the animals under a long period of administration (8 months) showed macroscopic tumours. Morphometric studies on glutathione-S-transferase (GST) positive preneoplastic lesions revealed an increase in the mean size of foci and nodules corresponding to 8 months of treatment, whereas no changes were observed between animals with short exposure and only-initiated controls. No differences were seen in the incidence of these lesions between any of the protocols. In addition to an acute hyperplastic effect on non-initiated liver described earlier, our preliminary results suggest cytotoxicity and an enhancement of the liver cell turnover after several months of continuous EE administration. These results taken together suggest that promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis by EE largely depends on the time of exposure to the compound and that chronic effects on the liver cell turnover may play an important role in its ability to promote hepatocarcinogenesis.
After 70 years of regular use, quinidine remains one of the most useful drugs in the management of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Quinidine sulfate, from conventional dosage forms, is absorbed rapidly and reaches peak levels in 1 hour. Sustained-release quinidine sulfate and gluconate are absorbed more slowly and, thus, may provide a more satisfactory response with less fluctuation in the peak and trough at quinidine concentrations. The half-life and absorption characteristics of sustained-release quinidine suggest that an 8- to 12-hour dosage regimen will produce smooth, sustained quinidine levels. Whereas quinidine and digitalis have been used concomitantly for years, dramatic elevations in blood digoxin levels have been observed. When quinidine is added to the regimen of a patient taking digitalis, these increased digoxin levels may be responsible for some of the adverse effects previously attributed to quinidine administration and can be reduced by adjustment of the digoxin dosage. Drug monitoring of serum quinidine concentrations as well as peak levels is essential to assess patient compliance and to determine that therapeutic levels are maintained. This is especially important because of the drug's relatively narrow therapeutic index and the changes in clearance that can result from drug interactions and renal and hepatic disturbances. A personal computer program is available to carry out pharmacokinetic calculations and assist in determining appropriate doses for individual patients.
Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TRCP), a flame-retardant plasticizer used in plastics, polymeric foams, and synthetic fibers, was studied as part of the National Toxicology Program's class study of trisalkyl phosphate flame retardants. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering TRCP (approximately 98% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 16 days, 16 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were performed in Salmonella typhimurium and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. 16-Day Studies: There were no chemical-related deaths, differences in final mean body weight, or histopathological lesions in rats receiving 22 to 350 mg/kg TRCP or in mice receiving 44 to 700 mg/kg TRCP for 12 doses over 16 days. Serum cholinesterase activity in female rats receiving 175 or 350 mg/kg TRCP was reduced slightly (80% of control levels), but enzyme activity in dosed male rats and in mice was similar to that in controls. 16-Week Studies: Rats received 22 to 350 mg/kg TRCP for 16 weeks (female) or 18 weeks (male). Several male and female rats in the 175 or 350 mg/kg dose groups died from chemical toxicity. Final mean body weights of female rats receiving 350 mg/kg were 20% greater than those of controls; final mean body weights of the remaining groups of dosed female rats and dosed male rats were similar. Chemical-related neuronal necrosis occurred in the hippocampus and thalamus of female rats and, to a lesser extent, of male rats. Serum cholinesterase activity was reduced in females receiving 175 or 350 mg/kg TRCP. There were no chemical-related deaths, differences in final mean body weight, or differences in cholinesterase activity in mice receiving 44 to 700 mg/kg TRCP for 16 weeks. Tubule epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei (cytomegaly and karyomegaly) were observed in the kidneys of high-dose (700 mg/kg) male and female mice. 2-Year Studies: The 2-year studies in rats were conducted by administering 0, 44, or 88 mg/kg TRCP to groups of 60 males and females, 5 days per week for up to 104 weeks; 9 or 10 rats of each dose group were evaluated at 66 weeks. The survival of high-dose male and female rats was reduced relative to that of controls. Final mean body weights of surviving rats were similar to those of controls. The principal chemical-related effects occurred in the kidney and brain of dosed rats. Focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium and renal tubule adenomas were markedly increased in male rats receiving 88 mg/kg TRCP and, to a lesser extent, in female rats (renal tubule hyperplasia, male rats: 0/50; 2/50; 24/50; female rats: 0/50; 3/50; 16/50; renal tubule adenoma, male rats: 1/50; 5/50; 24/50; female rats: 0/50; 2/50; 5/50). Renal tubule carcinomas occurred in one control and one high-dose male rat. Degenerative lesions consisting of gliosis, mineralization, hemorrhage, and/or hemosiderin accumulation occurred in the cerebrum and brain stem of more than 50% of female rats receiving 44 or 88 mg/kg TRCP; similar lesions were seen in only a few dosed males. Slightly increased incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell neoplasms (male rats: 5/50; 14/50; 13/50; female rats: 14/50; 16/50; 20/50) occurred in dosed males and females, but it is uncertain whether these were related to chemical administration. The 2-year studies in mice were conducted by administering 0, 175, or 350 mg/kg TRCP to groups of 60 males and females, 5 days per week for up to 104 weeks; 8 to 10 mice of each sex per dose group were evaluated at 66 weeks. There were no significant differences in survival between dosed and control groups of either sex, and final mean body weights of mice were similar among all groups. The principal chemical-related effects occurred in the kidney, in which nuclear enlargement (karyomegaly) of tubule epithelial cells was present in approximately 80% of high-dose mice. In the original diagnosis, renal tubule adenomas were seen in one control male, one high-dose male, and one low-dose female. A carcinoma was also seen in one high-dose male. In a s seen in one high-dose male. In a subsequent examination of step sections of all the mouse kidneys, adenomas were found in one low-dose male and two high-dose males. The incidences of renal tubule neoplasms in the original and step sections combined were 1/50, 1/50, and 4/50 for males. Female mice receiving TRCP demonstrated a marginally increased incidence of neoplasms (primarily adenomas) of the harderian gland (3/50; 8/50; 7/50); in addition, three harderian gland neoplasms occurred in high-dose female mice evaluated after 66 weeks. Genetic Toxicology: TRCP was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, or TA98 with or without exogenous metabolic activation (S9), and it tested negative for the induction of chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. TRCP produced an equivocal response in the presence of S9 for the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in CHO cells. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for male and female F344/N rats receiving tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate as shown by increased incidences of renal tubule adenomas. Thyroid follicular cell neoplasms and mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats may have been related to chemical administration. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice as shown by a marginally increased incidence of renal tubule cell neoplasms. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice as shown by a marginally increased incidence of harderian gland adenomas. Renal tubule cell hyperplasia in male and female rats and gliosis, hemorrhage, pigmentation (hemosiderin accumulation), and mineralization in the brains of female rats were associated with the administration of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate. Karyomegaly of renal tubule epithelial cells in male and female mice was also chemical related. Synonyms: 2-chloroethanol phosphate (3:1); tris(b-chloroethyl) phosphate Trade Names: Fyrol CEF; Disflamoll TCA; NIAX flame retardant
Administration of tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole or of two dithiolthiones to female CD-1 mice protected against the acute toxic effects of two hepatotoxic agents, acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride. Reduced mortality of mice was observed following pretreatment with tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole or dithiolthiones. Pretreatment reduced or prevented hepatic glutathione depletion produced by these two hepatotoxic agents. Liver damage, i.e., as determined by serum transaminase and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities, was less after pretreatment with tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole or dithiolthiones. Administration of dithiolthiones resulted in increased (from four- to over six-fold) activities of liver glutathione-S-transferases.
We considered the influence of ethambutol therapy for lung TBC on the visual function of patients. Cases of toxic optic neuropathy caused by ethambutol therapy in patients hospitalized in the Ophthalmic Clinic in Rijeka within 5 years were presented. Results of the treatment of toxic optic neuropathy caused by ethambutol are influenced by risk factors such as: diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, alcoholism and in our opinion, atherosclerosis and very old age.
