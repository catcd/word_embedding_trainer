Visceral pain is common symptom involved in many gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We investigated the molecular mechanisms and the role for voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) in the pathogenesis in a rat model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) induced visceral inflammatory hypersensitivity.
Using Agilent cDNA arrays, we found 172 genes changed significantly in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of TNBS treated rats. Among these changed genes, Cav1.2 and Cav2.3 were significantly up-regulated. Then the RT-PCR and Western blot further confirmed the up-regulation of Cav1.2 and Cav2.3. The whole cell patch clamp recording of acutely dissociated colonic specific DRG neurons showed that the peak IBa density was significantly increased in colonic neurons of TNBS treated rats compared with control rats (-127.82 ± 20.82 pA/pF Vs -91.67 ± 19.02 pA/pF, n = 9, *P < 0.05). To distinguish the different type of calcium currents with the corresponding selective channel blockers, we found that L-type (-38.56 ± 3.97 pA/pF Vs -25.75 ± 3.35 pA/pF, n = 9, * P < 0.05) and R-type (-13.31 ± 1.36 pA/pF Vs -8.60 ± 1.25 pA/pF, n = 9, * P < 0.05) calcium current density were significantly increased in colonic DRG neurons of TNBS treated rats compared with control rats. In addition, pharmacological blockade with L-type antagonist (nimodipine) and R-type antagonist (SNX-482) with intrathecal injection attenuates visceral pain in TNBS induced inflammatory visceral hypersensitivity.
Cav1.2 and Cav2.3 in colonic primary sensory neurons play an important role in visceral inflammatory hyperalgesia, which maybe the potential therapeutic targets.
Clinical trials of neural grafting for Parkinson's disease (PD) have produced variable, but overall disappointing, results. One particular disappointment has been the development of aberrant motor complications following dopamine (DA) neuron grafting. Despite a lack of consistent benefit, the utility of dopamine neuron replacement remains supported by clinical and basic data. In a continued effort to elucidate factors that might improve this therapy, we used a parkinsonian rat model to examine whether pregraft chronic levodopa affected graft efficacy and/or graft-induced dyskinesia (GID) induction. Indeed, all grafted PD patients to date have had a pregraft history of long-term levodopa. It is well established that long-term levodopa results in a plethora of long-lasting neurochemical alterations and genomic changes indicative of altered structural and synaptic plasticity. Thus, therapeutic dopamine terminal replacement in a striatal environment complicated by such changes could be expected to lead to abnormal or inappropriate connections between graft and host brain and to contribute to suboptimal efficacy and/or postgraft GID behaviors. To investigate the effect of pregraft levodopa, one group of parkinsonian rats received levodopa for 4 weeks prior to grafting. A second levodopa-naïve group was grafted, and the grafts were allowed to mature for 9 weeks prior to introducing chronic levodopa. We report here that, in parkinsonian rats, preexposure to chronic levodopa significantly reduces behavioral and neurochemical efficacy of embryonic dopamine grafts. Furthermore, dopamine terminal replacement prior to introduction of chronic levodopa is highly effective at preventing development of levodopa-induced dyskinesias, and GID-like behaviors occur regardless of pregraft levodopa status.
Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation, proinflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species have been implicated as mediators of liver injury and fibrogenesis. We have shown recently that pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an antioxidant and inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation, was protective in a rat model of acute liver failure. The aim of the present study was to examine the efficacy of PDTC in a chronic rat model of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatic fibrosis.
Liver cirrhosis was induced by intraperitoneal injections of TAA (200 mg/kg) twice weekly for 12 weeks. Two groups of rats also received PDTC (either 20 or 60 mg/kg, i.p. for 12 weeks).
TAA administration induced liver cirrhosis, which was inhibited by PDTC in a dose-dependent manner. The histopathologic score of fibrosis, the spleen weight, and hepatic hydroxyproline were significantly lower in the rats treated with TAA+PDTC compared with TAA only (P<0.001). The hepatic levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and protein carbonyls after 12 weeks of treatment were also lower in the rats treated with TAA+PDTC (P=0.02 and 0.01, respectively), indicating reduced oxidative stress. Immunohistochemical studies and in situ hybridization demonstrated inhibition of stellate cell (alpha smooth muscle actin positive) activation, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, and collagen alpha1(I) gene expression in the livers of the PDTC-treated rats. As determined by Northern blot analysis, PDTC had no inhibitory effect on collagen alpha1(I) gene expression in the rat hepatic stellate cells-T6 cells in vitro.
PDTC inhibits the development of liver cirrhosis in TAA-treated rats. The mechanism of action is associated with decreased oxidative stress and hepatic necroinflammation.
Chronic neurological deficits have been described in patients after presumed accidental subarachnoid injection of 2-chloroprocaine-CE (Nesacaine-CE; N-CE) intended for epidural block. This study investigated the possible role of pure 2-chloroprocaine (2-CP) and sodium bisulfite, two components of Nesacaine-CE, in causing these complications when injected separately into the lumbar subarachnoid space of neurologically intact awake rabbits. Repeated 2-4-mg spinal anesthetic doses of pure 2-CP in lactated Ringer's solution did not produce chronic hindlimb paralysis even though accumulated doses reached 50 mg. However, 1.2-2.4 mg of sodium bisulfite, the antioxidant in N-CE added to prolong shelf-life, resulted in irreversible hindlimb paralysis in 12 out of 14 animals. This amount of bisulfite is contained in 12-24 mg of 2% N-CE. The demonstration that persistent paralysis resulted from low dosages of sodium bisulfite contained in commercially available 2-CP requires reevaluation of the suitability of this antioxidant for products prepared for intrathecal use.
This study presents a 10-year survey of 2285 patients tested to common preservatives in northern Israel. The demographic and clinical data were analysed using a revised MOAHLFA index. Patch testing was based on the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group (ICDRG) guidelines. 411 (18%) patients were found to have positive reactions to 1 or more preservatives. The most frequent allergens tested positively were thimerosal, methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI), and formaldehyde. The reactions to MCI/MI remained stable around 1.7% throughout the years 1995-1998, with a significant increase to 3.7%-4% (P = 0.029) during 1999-2004. The reactions to formaldehyde remained low around 0.3% until 1999; however, a considerable increase throughout the years 2000-2004 was noted, with rates of 1.5%-1.9% (P = 0.028). The sensitivity rates for parabens, quaternium-15, imidazolidinylurea, and diazolidinylurea were low and unchanged, mostly under 0.5%. As for methyldibromoglutaronitrile (MDBGN), sensitivity rates around 2% were detected for the years 1996 and throughout 2000-2004. Overall, this extensive survey showed a concerning increase in the sensitivity rates for MCI/MI, formaldehyde, and MDBGN.
In this report we present the history of a patient treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in whom episodes of hypotonia can be related to the administration of amikacin, an antibiotic from the aminoglycosides group. The 68-year-old female patient was admitted for initiation of renal replacement therapy with CAPD. Her renal failure was probably attributable to hypertension. Three days after catheter implantation, the patient reported dysuric symptoms, and a urine culture showed significant growth of Escherichia coli. Amikacin 250 mg and cefazolin 1.0 g were administered intravenously once daily in accordance with the antibiogram. On the third day of antibiotic administration, the patient fainted, showing an arterial blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. On the subsequent 2 days, decreases of postural arterial blood pressure to between 90/60 mmHg and 80/50 mmHg were reported two or three times daily. The patient was treated with antibiotics for the next 6 days and felt very bad the entire time, with an arterial blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg. The patient's condition improved 2 days after discontinuation of treatment with antibiotics, and episodes of hypotonia stopped. The decrease in the arterial blood pressure observed in our patient during intravenous administration of amikacin can, with a high probability, be related to the calcimimetic activity of this aminoglycoside and the resulting inhibition of parathyroid secretion.
Crizotinib [Xalkori; PF02341066; (R)-3-[1-(2,6-dichloro-3-fluoro-phenyl)-ethoxy]-5-(1-piperidin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-pyridin-2-ylamine] is an orally available dual inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor. The objectives of the present studies were to characterize: 1) the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of crizotinib plasma concentrations to the inhibition of ALK phosphorylation in tumors, and 2) the relationship of ALK inhibition to antitumor efficacy in human tumor xenograft models. Crizotinib was orally administered to athymic nu/nu mice implanted with H3122 non-small-cell lung carcinomas or severe combined immunodeficient/beige mice implanted with Karpas299 anaplastic large-cell lymphomas. Plasma concentration-time courses of crizotinib were adequately described by a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. A pharmacodynamic link model reasonably fit the time courses of ALK inhibition in both H3122 and Karpas299 models with EC(50) values of 233 and 666 ng/ml, respectively. A tumor growth inhibition model also reasonably fit the time course of individual tumor growth curves with EC(50) values of 255 and 875 ng/ml, respectively. Thus, the EC(50) for ALK inhibition approximately corresponded to the EC(50) for tumor growth inhibition in both xenograft models, suggesting that >50% ALK inhibition would be required for significant antitumor efficacy (>50%). Furthermore, based on the observed clinical pharmacokinetic data coupled with the pharmacodynamic parameters obtained from the present nonclinical xenograft mouse model, >70% ALK inhibition was projected in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who were administered the clinically recommended dosage of crizotinib, twice-daily doses of 250 mg (500 mg/day). The result suggests that crizotinib could sufficiently inhibit ALK phosphorylation for significant antitumor efficacy in patients.
Young adult, male and female, normotensive Sprague-Dawley (S-D) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were injected with propranolol three times daily for 3 weeks. None of the animals manifested signs of withdrawal when the injections were terminated. Seven days later, the animals were challenged with a dose of isoproterenol which would produce massive myocardial infarction and 50-60% mortality in non-treated animals. The propranolol pretreatment caused marked tranquilizing and blood pressure lowering effects in SHR exclusively. Despite the 7-day propranolol withdrawal period, very few animals died and myocardial damage was minimal. However, blood pressure levels dropped to shock-like levels, blood CPK and LDH levels showed dynamic increases, there was marked hypertriglyceridaemia, and plasma corticosterone rose to supranormal levels. Microscopically, the hearts of the propranolol pretreated animals showed little evidence of necrosis but the SHR hearts manifested large atrial and ventricular thrombi. It is suggested that in the rat, propranolol treatment causes positive myocardial protective effects mediated through hormonal and metabolic changes and propranolol withdrawal does not lead to hypersensitivity to catecholamines. In fact, the beta-blocking effects of propranolol remain effective for some time after withdrawal.
A study comparing tubocurarine and pancuronium for precurarization indicates that either successfully attenuates fasciculation after succinylcholine administration. However, if the aim is to prevent or attenuate such side effects of succinylcholine as cardiac arrhythmias, hyperkalemia, and increased intraocular pressure, there is as yet no proof that pancuronium will be effective in these areas.
To describe a large cohort of patients who had chest pain following cocaine use, and to determine the incidence of and clinical characteristics predictive for myocardial infarction in this group of patients.
A prospective observational cohort study of consecutive patients with cocaine-associated chest pain was conducted in six municipal hospital emergency departments (EDs). Demographic variables, drug abuse patterns, medical histories, chest pain characteristics, ECG results, and laboratory data were recorded. Myocardial infarction was the primary endpoint.
Fourteen of 246 patients (5.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-8.7%) had myocardial infarction, as diagnosed by elevated CK-MB isoenzyme levels. There were two deaths (0.8%). The patients had a median age of 33 years. The majority were male (71.5%), non-white (83.3%), cigarette smokers (83.3%) who used cocaine regularly. Chest pain began a median of 60 minutes after cocaine use and persisted for a median of 120 minutes. Chest pain was most frequently described as substernal (71.3%) and pressure-like (46.7%). Shortness of breath (59.3%) and diaphoresis (38.6%) were common. There was no clinical difference between patients who had myocardial infarctions and those who did not. Twelve patients had arrhythmias and four had congestive heart failure. All cases requiring intervention were evident upon presentation. An ECG revealing ischemia or infarction had a sensitivity of 35.7% for predicting a myocardial infarction. The specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the ECGs were 89.9%, 17.9%, and 95.8%, respectively.
Myocardial infarction in patients who have cocaine-associated chest pain is not uncommon. No clinical parameter available to the physician can adequately identify patients at very low risk for myocardial infarction. Therefore, all patients with cocaine-associated chest pain should be evaluated for myocardial infarction.
Administration of either gallamine or d-tubocurarine before injecting succinylcholine diminished both the incidence and intensity of muscle fasciculations. Gallamine was more efficient than curare in this respect, 30 mg./70kg. almost entirely preventing fasciculations.
Pemoline is an oxazolidine derivative that is structurally different from amphetamines and used in the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Pemoline has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute movement disorders. The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with pemoline who experienced profound choreoathetosis.
Two, 3-year-old male, identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of pemoline originally containing 59 tablets. The children had a medical history significant for attention deficit disorder previously treated with methylphenidate without success. This was their first day of pemoline therapy. The choreoathetoid movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion. The children gave no history of prior movement disorders and there was no family history of movement disorders. The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous benzodiazepines in an attempt to control the choreoathetoid movements. Despite treatment, the children continued to have choreoathetosis for approximately 24 hours. Forty-eight hours after admission, the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home.
Pemoline associated movement disorder has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature. The possibility of choreoathetoid movements should be considered in patients presenting after pemoline overdose.
The homeobox (HOX) genes are a large family of regulator genes involved in the control of developmental processes and cell differentiation. The HOX genes encode transcription factors, and an increasing number of studies have shown that these genes may be implicated in the growth and the progression of many types of tumours. The present study investigated the expression of the HOX and integrin genes and their relationships in gastric carcinoma. We analyzed the RNA expression of 13 HOX genes from HOXA, C and D clusters and alphaV, alpha5 and alpha8 integrin genes in 24 gastric cancer samples by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the HOXA2 gene and the alpha8 integrin gene had a lower expression in tumour samples than in normal gastric mucosas. The comparison between the HOX and integrin genes showed that HOXA2 and alphaV integrin expression presented the same trend in 83% of the samples. Moreover, in cancer samples that expressed the HOXD11 gene, the expression of alphaV integrin was lower with respect to normal mucosas. The different roles of HOX and integrin genes in gastric carcinoma remain to be fully elucidated. These findings suggest that the HOX genes may play a critical role in the genesis, maintenance and diffusion of gastric carcinoma.
The basolateral amygdala (BLA), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and dorsal hippocampus (DH) are critical elements of the neurocircuitry of drug context-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking; however, little is known about functional interactions between these brain regions. The present study tested the hypothesis that serial information processing by the BLA and dmPFC mediates drug context-induced cocaine-seeking, whereas the BLA and DH independently control this behaviour. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine in a distinct environment (cocaine-paired context) followed by extinction training in a different environment (extinction context). On the test days, rats received unilateral microinfusions of baclofen + muscimol or of vehicle into the BLA and either the contralateral or ipsilateral dmPFC or DH. Cocaine-seeking behaviour (i.e. nonreinforced presses on the cocaine-associated lever) was then assessed in the cocaine-paired and extinction contexts. Following vehicle pretreatment, exposure to the cocaine-paired context reinstated extinguished cocaine-seeking behaviour. BLA-dmPFC asymmetrical inactivation attenuated cocaine-seeking behaviour relative to vehicle treatment; however, this impairment equaled that produced by ipsilateral BLA-dmPFC inactivation. Furthermore, unilateral inactivation of the BLA or dmPFC did not alter this behaviour. BLA-DH asymmetrical inactivation selectively attenuated cocaine-seeking behaviour relative to vehicle treatment whereas ipsilateral or unilateral inactivation of the BLA and DH did not alter this behaviour. These findings indicate that the BLA and DH exhibit sequential information processing within the relapse circuitry. In contrast, interactions between the BLA and dmPFC are more complex and include parallel loops of information processing and/or necessary interhemispheric input from the dmPFC to the BLA, probably in addition to direct intrahemispheric interactions.
The aim of the study was to investigate safety, efficacy and tolerability of risperidone in comparison with haloperidol in the long-term treatment of autistic disorder.
This was an open-label continuation study of the randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of risperidone and haloperidol study for 12 week in autistic children and adolescents. A total of 28 subjects between 8 and 18 ages with autistic disorder were enrolled to the open label phase of the study. Behavioral rating scales (Clinical Global Impression Scale [CGI-I], Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale [RF-RLRS]), Aberrant Behavior Checklist [ABC], Turgay DSM-IV Pervasive Developmental Disorder Rating Scale [TPDDRS]) and safety assessment scales (Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale [ESRS], UKU-Side Effect Rating Scale) were performed at 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks, following the 12 week double-blind phase. Risperidone and haloperidol treatments were applied with a once daily dosage regimen as 0.01-0.08 mg/kg/day.
Risperidone led to a significant greater reduction on CGI scale. There was significant improvement on RF-RLRS sensory motor and language subscale and ABC scores in risperidone group. Weight gain was observed more frequently in the haloperidol group at week 24.
These results demonstrate that risperidone is more efficacious and well tolerated than haloperidol in the long-term maintenance treatment of autistic disorder.
Long-term exposure to benzene vapors is associated with hematological diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma and aplastic anemia. CD(1) male mice were randomly assigned to six groups: 1B(10), 1B(15), 1B(20), 2B(10), 2B(15), and 2B(20.) 1B mice were administered 2 ml/kg (1940 mg/kg) subcutaneous injection (in the dorsal region) of benzene 5 days a week, and 2B mice were exposed 3 days a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) until a total of 10, 15 and 20 doses were completed. About 48 h after treatment completion, leukocyte, erythrocyte, and bone marrow cells were counted, and spleen histopathology was analyzed. 1B(15) and 1B(20) mice showed lethargy and irritability, 80% body and 42% spleen weight loss (P<0.001), while body and spleen weight loss were less severe in 2B mice (12 and 48%, respectively). After exposure to 20 benzene doses, 1B(20) and 2B(20) mice showed decreased hemoglobin concentrations, and erythrocyte, leukocyte and bone marrow cell counts (37, 34, 80 and 50%, respectively in group 1B(20); P<0.001; and 12, 48, 62 and 62%, respectively in group 2B(20)). Thrombocytopenia occurred only in group 2B. Both benzene-treatment schemes caused aplastic anemia, however, the disease was masked by spleen toxicity in group 1B. Scheme 2 allowed mice survival and caused less non-hematological effects. We establish here a reproducible and inexpensive experimental model to induce aplastic anemia in mice by subcutaneous injection of 2 ml/kg benzene, using two short-term treatment schemes.
Sevoflurane administration impairs memory processes in both humans and animals. Increasing evidence suggests that enhancement of the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), as a result of acute administration of lithium chloride (LiCl), may enhance memory consolidation. The current experiments examined whether GSK-3β phosphorylation was involved in mediating the memory impairing effects of posttraining sevoflurane on inhibitory avoidance (IA) retention. In experiment 1, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to sevoflurane (0.5%, 1%, or 2%) for 2h immediately after training in a continuous multiple-trail IA paradigm. Sevoflurane (2% inspired) induced significant impairment of retention performance on a 24-h test and inhibited phosphorylation of GSK-3β in the hippocampus 2h after training. In experiment 2, administration of LiCl (100mg/kg, intraperitoneally) 30 min before IA training not only blocked the sevoflurane-induced impairment of consolidation, but also reversed the inhibitory effect of sevoflurane on GSK-3β phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that sevoflurane exposure can impair consolidation of IA memory in rats. Sevoflurane-induced amnesia may be due, at least in part, to suppression of GSK-3β phosphorylation in the hippocampus.
Risperidone significantly improves behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including aggression, agitation and psychosis, as shown by randomized, placebo-controlled trials.
An 8-week, multicenter, naturalistic, open-label study was carried out to examine whether the benefits of risperidone apply to clinical practice. A total of 4499 patients were treated with risperidone at flexible doses chosen by physicians, and were included in the safety evaluation. Of these, 3909 patients met the intended study criteria (at least 65 years of age, dementia, and the presence of BPSD) and were included in the efficacy analyses.
At the end of the study (after 8 weeks of treatment), risperidone (average final dose 1.6 mg/day) significantly improved all symptoms studied (agitation, aggressiveness, disturbance of the sleep-wake rhythm, social withdrawal, suspiciousness and delusions) as rated by physicians on a five-point scale of severity. On a four-point scale of global efficacy, more than 90% of patients were rated improved by both physicians and caregivers after 8 weeks of treatment. A significant improvement in sleep-wake cycle disturbances was also noted. A total of 422 adverse events were documented in 346 of the 4499 patients (7.7%); these included insufficient efficacy (2.6%), extrapyramidal symptoms (0.89%), deterioration of psychiatric symptoms (0.73%), sedation (0.56%), gastrointestinal disturbances (0.49%), cardiovascular disorders (0.38%), and cerebrovascular adverse events (0.36%).
Risperidone is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for BPSD in routine clinical practice.
It has been reported that cocaine is associated with trauma patients at epidemic proportions. However, the injury patterns, complications, and mortality in cocaine test-positive trauma patients are not well known.
Retrospective review of all trauma patients with toxicology screen at a Level I trauma center between January 2002 and December 2005. A total of 1,096 patients were positive for cocaine but no other substances of abuse or alcohol. Nine hundred eighty-five patients of these cocaine test-positive patients were matched to a pool of 4,846 toxicology test-negative patients admitted during the same period with respect to age (< or = 18, 19-55, > 55 years), gender, mechanism (blunt, penetrating), Injury Severity Score (ISS < 16, 16-25, > 25), head Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS < 3, > or = 3), chest AIS (< 3, > or = 3), abdominal AIS (< 3, > or = 3), and extremity AIS (< 3, > or = 3). Matched pairs of binary outcomes were analyzed using McNemars, and continuous data were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test.
The two groups had similar injury patterns and there was no difference in surgical procedures between cocaine test-positive and toxicology test-negative patients. Overall, there was no difference in mortality between the cocaine and test-negative patients (6.5% vs. 6.2%; p = 0.81), or between cocaine and test-negative patients with an ISS < 16 (1.4% vs. 1.5%; p = 1.00), ISS 16 to 25 (13% vs. 12%; p = 1.00), and ISS > 25 (59% vs. 54%; p = 0.70). The overall incidence of complications was 4% in cocaine patients and 3.6% in test-negative patients (p = 0.72), although the incidence of pneumonia was significantly higher in the cocaine test-positive patients (p = 0.04).
Cocaine abuse in trauma patients is concerning. This study did not show a difference in mortality or length of intensive care unit stay between cocaine positive and negative patients. However, there was a significantly higher incidence of pneumonia in cocaine positive patients. Implementation of effective prevention strategies may help reduce cocaine related victims of trauma.
Scratching is the behavioral manifestation of pruritus. The pruritus of cholestasis can be severe, intractable and affect the quality of life. We investigated if ethynylestradiol (EE)-induced cholestasis is associated with scratching in rats and if nalfurafine, a kappa opioid receptor agonist with antipruritic effects in human uremic pruritus, would antagonize such scratching. Chronic injection of EE (2 mg/kg, s.c., for 14 days) induced cholestasis as documented by increased serum concentrations of bile acids and caused a higher incidence of body scratching compared to vehicle, thus providing an animal model to study scratching behavior secondary to cholestasis. Pretreating the rats with nalfurafine (0.005-0.04 mg/kg, s.c.) inhibited EE-induced scratching dose-dependently with an A(50) value of 0.013 (0.009-0.021) mg/kg. Serum levels of dynorphin A and nitric oxide were decreased in rats with cholestasis compared to control animals. Our data suggest that (a) nalfurafine has the potential to relieve cholestatic pruritus and (b) both kappa opioid and nitric oxide systems are involved, at least in part, in mediating the pruritus of cholestasis.
Chronic pelvic pain disorders often overlap. We have shown that acute colonic irritation can produce acute irritative micturition patterns and acutely sensitize bladder afferent responses to mechanical and chemical stimuli. We hypothesize that with time, colonic irritation can lead to neurogenic changes in the bladder and the development of chronic bladder sensitization.
Micturition patterns were measured in rats 60-90 days after the induction of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis in the resolution phase of this model. Total and activated mast cells (MCs) were quantified in the bladder, while mRNA levels of stem cell factor (SCF; a.k.a. MC growth factor) and nerve growth factor (NGF; a MC and nociceptive C-fiber stimulator) were quantified in the bladder and L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia (DRG).
Following intra-rectal TNBS, voiding volume was reduced (P < 0.005), while voiding frequency was increased (P < 0.05), both by approximately 50%. Furthermore, both the percentage and density of activated bladder MCs were significantly elevated (P < 0.05), although total MC counts were not statistically increased. At the molecular level, urinary bladder SCF expression increased twofold (P < 0.005), as did NGF (P < 0.01), while L6-S1 DRG levels were not significantly elevated.
Chronic cystitis in the rat as evidenced by changes in micturition patterns and the recruitment of activated MCs can occur during the resolution phase of TNBS colitis. These changes, of which MCs may play an important role, appear to be maintained over time and may occur via stimulation of convergent pelvic afferent input resulting in the upregulation of neurotrophic factors in the target organ.
This study compared the transmural distribution of high-energy phosphate (HEP) depletion during oxidative stress induced by pacing- and dobutamine-induced tachycardia in myocardium perfused by a flow-limiting coronary stenosis. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured with radioactive microspheres. Creatine phosphate (CrP), ATP, and P(i) were measured with transmurally localized (31)P NMR spectroscopy. In normal dogs a hydraulic occluder was used to produce a left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis, which maintained constant flow measured with a Doppler probe. Tachycardia was induced by rapid pacing (200 beats/min, n = 11) or by dobutamine infusion (20 micrograms . kg(-1). min(-1) iv, n = 13) to produce a similar heart rate. In the presence of stenosis, pacing and dobutamine caused similar reductions of subendocardial (Endo)-to-subepicardial (Epi) MBF ratios (0.66 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.08, respectively). Stenosis plus pacing caused a decrease of the CrP-to-ATP ratio (CrP/ATP) in Endo from 2.00 +/- 0.07 to 1.65 +/- 0. 08 (P < 0.05) with no significant change in Epi. Stenosis plus dobutamine caused HEP changes across the left ventricular wall, which were most marked in the outer myocardial layer (Epi CrP/ATP decreased from 2.33 +/- 0.11 to 1.67 +/- 0.12; Endo CrP/ATP decreased from 1.99 +/- 0.09 to 1.64 +/- 0.12). Thus HEP changes during oxidative stress that are produced by pacing parallel the pattern of hypoperfusion and are most severe in the subendocardium. In contrast, in response to inotropic stimulation, the transmural metabolic changes did not correspond to the pattern of the hypoperfusion.
An increase in polydrug abuse is a major problem worldwide. A previous study showed that coadministration of methamphetamine and morphine induced lethality in rodents and humans. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the lethality is increased by the coadministration of methamphetamine and morphine have not been fully understood. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the mechanism of increased lethality induced by methamphetamine and morphine. Coadministered methamphetamine and morphine increased the lethality by more than 70% in BALB/c mice. Pretreatment with NMDA-receptor antagonists, such as MK-801 and 3-((R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl) propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), and benzamide [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor] significantly attenuated the increased lethality induced by methamphetamine and morphine. Furthermore, the lethal effect induced by methamphetamine and morphine was completely attenuated by immediate cooling after the coadministration of methamphetamine and morphine. It has been reported that methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity can be blocked by lowering the temperature, and this effect might be mediated by a reduction of release of free radicals. These results suggest that activation of NMDA receptors and PARP play an important role in the increased lethality induced by methamphetamine and morphine.
It has been postulated that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the active trophic androgen in initiating pathogenic changes in the prostate gland. Groups of prostate cancer-susceptible male L-W rats (age 3 months) were treated with subcutaneous depots of testosterone or of DHT. After 14 months, prostate adenocarcinomas had developed in 24% of the testosterone-treated rats but not in the DHT-treated rats. In the latter rats, the testes were significantly reduced in weight, there was no evidence of spermatogenesis, and serum testosterone levels were not detectable. It appears that DHT as administered to L-W rats had an antiandrogenic effect.
Ozone (O(3)) exposure evokes asthma exacerbations by mechanisms that are poorly understood. We used a murine model to characterize the effects of O(3) on allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness and to identify factors that might contribute to the O(3)-induced exacerbation of asthma.
BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with Aspergillus fumigatus (Af). A group of sensitized and challenged mice was exposed to 3.0 ppm of O(3) for 2 h and studied 12 h later (96 h after Af challenge). Naive mice and mice exposed to O(3) alone were used as controls. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular and cytokine content, lung function [enhanced pause (P(enh))], isometric force generation by tracheal rings and gene and protein expression of Fas and FasL were assessed. Apoptosis of eosinophils was quantified by FACS.
In sensitized mice allergen challenge induced a significant increase of P(enh) and contractile force in tracheal rings that peaked 24 h after challenge and resolved by 96 h. O(3) inhalation induced an exacerbation of airway hyperresponsiveness accompanied by recurrence of neutrophils and enhancement of eosinophils 96 h after allergen challenge. The combination of allergen and O(3) exposure inhibited Fas and FasL gene and protein expression and eosinophil apoptosis and increased interleukin-5 (IL-5), granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and G-CSF protein levels.
O(3) affects airway responsiveness of allergen-primed airways indirectly by increasing viability of eosinophils and eosinophil-mediated pathological changes.
