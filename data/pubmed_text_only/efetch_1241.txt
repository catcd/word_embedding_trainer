Metoclopramide is an antiemetic drug; the effects on CNS (acute dystonic reaction, tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism) occur in only 1 of 500 patients treated. Acute dystonic reactions are not apparently dose-dependent and suggest individual sensitivity to the drug (idiosyncrasia). We report 4 cases in 2 families (grandmother-grandchild; brother-sister). We feel that, if there is a case of dystonic reaction to metoclopramide, this drug should not be administered to other members of the same family.
Pentamidine isethionate is a diamidine compound used in the treatment of a number of parasitic diseases, notably Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Although cases of sudden death have been reported during the administration of pentamidine, there have been no reported cases in the literature of pentamidine-associated arrhythmias. Reported in this study are two cases of torsade de pointes occurring during the prolonged administration of pentamidine. In addition, electrocardiographic changes of marked QT interval prolongation, pronounced precordial T wave abnormalities, and ST segment changes were shown in both patients. Mild hypomagnesemia coexisted in both cases, but torsade de pointes persisted in one patient and electrocardiographic changes remained in both cases despite magnesium replacement. QT interval prolongation and electrocardiographic abnormalities resolved slowly over several days to weeks, paralleling the known elimination kinetics of pentamidine. These data suggest a proarrhythmic effect of pentamidine isethionate.
140 patients with a threatening premature birth at the greater than or equal to 24-less than 37 week of gestation were in this study randomly treated with hexoprenalin or salbutamol. In 77% in the hexoprenalin and in 74% in the salbutamol group the weight of the newborn was greater than or equal to 2500 g. In 66% in both study groups the birth occurred after the completed 37 weeks of gestation. During infusion of hexoprenalin tachycardia in mothers occurred statistically highly significantly less than during salbutamol. 11% of the mothers in the hexoprenalin group had side-effects during infusion compared to 30% in the salbutamol group. The correlation between the tocolysis-index (Baumgarten) and the prolongation-index (Richter) given by the regression lines facilitates in some measure the comparison of different tocolytic drugs concerning its tocolytic effect.
Methamphetamine is currently the most widespread illegal stimulant abused in the United States. No previous reports comparing echocardiographic findings of cardiomyopathy with and without a history of methamphetamine abuse are available.
We performed a single institution retrospective review of medical records and analyses of echocardiographic findings in patients < or = 45 years of age hospitalized between 2001 and 2004 who were discharged with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or heart failure. After exclusion of patients with coronary artery disease or severe cardiac valvular disease, the remaining patients were divided into 2 groups based on their abuse or non abuse of methamphetamine, as determined by the documented history in the medical records or urine toxicology testing.
Among a total of 59 patients, 28 (47%) had a history of methamphetamine abuse or positive urine toxicology. Both methamphetamine abusers and non-abusers were predominately male (64.3% vs 64.5%, P = .99), and had a high prevalence of obesity (55.6% vs 73.3%, P = .16). Bivariate analysis revealed significant differences between the methamphetamine abusers and non-abusers in left atrium volume (119.7 +/- 55.4 ml vs 85.8 +/- 33.5 ml, P = .008), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (201.9 +/- 71.4 ml vs 156.6 +/- 63.1 ml, P = .01), left ventricular end-systolic volume (136.0 +/- 53.7 ml vs 92.3 +/- 55.8 ml, P = .004), right ventricular dimension (26.3 +/- 6.0 mm vs 21.3 +/- 6.0 mm, P = .007), and quantified left ventricular ejection fraction (32.9% +/- 11.3% vs 44.6% +/- 17.8%, P = .004).
We found a high prevalence of methamphetamine abuse in our study population. Methamphetamine abusers had echocardiographic findings of more severe dilated cardiomyopathy compared with non-abusers.
High exposure of manganese is believed to be a risk factor for respiratory diseases. Evidence suggests that overexpression of HIF-1alpha transcription factor is linked to pulmonary inflammation and vascular change. In this study, we investigated the effect of manganese-chloride (manganese) on expression and activity of HIF-1alpha in various human airway cells, including Hep2 (laryngeal), H292 (bronchial), and A549 (lung). Profoundly, while manganese treatment led to low or little effect on induction of HIF-1alpha protein in H292 or A549 cells, it strongly induced HIF-1alpha protein expression in Hep2 cells. Mn treatment, however, did not induce HIF-1alpha mRNA expression in Hep2 cells. Luciferase experiments further demonstrated that manganese treatment increased the HRE-driven luciferase activity, suggesting that the induced HIF-1 is functional. Interestingly, manganese treatment also caused activation of p38 MAPK, JNK-1/2, ERK-1/2, and ATF-2, but not of PKB or NF-kappaB in Hep2 cells. Importantly, the manganese-mediated expression and activity of HIF-1alpha protein were largely blocked by treatment with the inhibitor of p38 MAPK (SB203580), JNK-1/2 (SP600125), or ERK-1/2 (PD98059), suggesting roles of these MAPKs in the manganese-induced HIF-1alpha protein expression and activity. Moreover, treatment with SP600125 or SB203580, but not PD98059, had partial inhibitory effects on the stability of HIF-1alpha protein induced by manganese, suggesting that p38 MAPK and JNK-1/2 also contribute to the Mn-mediated HIF-1alpha protein stability. These results suggest that manganese is able to up-regulate HIF-1alpha at the protein level in Hep2 cells and the up-regulation is largely dependent of activities of the family of MAPKs.
Several genetic alterations have been associated with sporadic prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, the association between RsaI and DraI polymorphisms of CYP2E1 and PCa risk was analysed in a case-control study of 227 individuals using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Regarding DraI polymorphisms, the DD genotype is over-represented in PCa cases when compared with the control group (odds ratio (OR) 2.12; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-4.05; P=0.022). Regarding the RsaI polymorphism, no significant differences were found. The results of this study indicate that DraI polymorphisms of the CYP2E1 gene may be associated with a twofold increased risk for the development of PCa.
To evaluate the drug interaction between fosamprenavir (FPV) and esomeprazole (ESO) after repeated doses in healthy adults.
Subjects received ESO 20 mg once daily (qd) for 7 days followed by either ESO 20 mg qd + FPV 1400 mg twice daily (bid) or ESO 20 mg qd + FPV 700 mg bid + ritonavir (RTV) 100 mg bid for 14 days in arms 1 and 2, respectively. After a 21- to 28-day washout, subjects received either FPV 1400 mg bid for 14 days (arm 1) or FPV 700 mg bid + RTV 100 mg bid for 14 days (arm 2). Pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted on the last day of each treatment.
Simultaneous coadministration of ESO 20 mg qd with either FPV 1400 mg bid or FPV 700 mg bid + RTV 100 mg bid had no effect on steady-state amprenavir pharmacokinetics. The only effect on plasma ESO exposure was a 55% increase in area under the plasma concentration-time curve during a dosing interval, tau[AUC0-tau], after coadministration of ESO 20 mg qd with FPV 1400 mg bid.
FPV 1400 mg bid or FPV 700 mg bid + RTV 100 mg bid may be coadministered simultaneously with ESO without dose adjustment. However, the impact of staggered administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on plasma amprenavir exposure is unknown at present.
The modulating effects of curcumin-free aqueous turmeric extract (CFATE), ethanolic turmeric extract (ETE) and turmeric (T) powder on the benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P)-induced forestomach tumors were investigated in Swiss female albino mice receiving oral administration of B(a)P at a dose of 1 mg twice weekly for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.2%/1.0%/5.0% turmeric-derived CFATE as sole source of drinking water or 0.01%/0.05%/0.25% ETE in diet or 0.2%/1.0%/5.0% T in diet, 2 weeks before, during and 2 weeks after the last dose of B(a)P (during initiation period) resulted in significant suppression of B(a)P-induced tumorigenesis when compared with the group receiving B(a)P and control diet/drinking water. Among different fractions tested, CFATE appears to be more powerful as not only did it reduce the tumor multiplicity to the lowest levels but it also significantly reduced the tumor incidence. Administration of 5.0% turmeric-derived CFATE as the sole source of drinking water or 0.25% ETE/5.0% T in diet starting from 48 h after the last dose of B(a)P (during the post-initiation period) until the termination of the experiment, also inhibited the formation of multiple gastric tumors by B(a)P, although the suppression of tumor multiplicity was appreciably more in the groups that received 5.0% turmeric-derived CFATE/0.25% ETE treatment during initiation with carcinogen, i.e. 2 weeks before, during and 2 weeks after the last dose of B(a)P. The present data clearly indicate the potential of turmeric-derived CFATE as a powerful chemopreventive fraction and also demonstrate the efficacy of lower, i.e. 1/25th and/or 1/5th of the reported, chemopreventive doses of T/ETE (essentially curcumins) in inhibiting B(a)P-induced forestomach tumors in mice.
Dioscorea bulbifera var sativa is a medicinal plant commonly used in Cameroonian traditional medicine to treat pain and inflammation.
The present work evaluated the effects of the methanol extract of the bulbs of Dioscorea bulbifera in inflammatory and neuropathic models of pain and further investigated its possible mechanism of action.
The effects of Dioscorea bulbifera administered orally at the doses of 250 and 500mg/kg were tested in mechanical hypernociception induced by intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or prostaglandin-E(2) (PGE(2)), as well as in partial ligation sciatic nerve (PLSN), nociception induced by capsaicin and thermal hyperalgesia induced by i.pl. injection of CFA. The therapeutic effects of Dioscorea bulbifera on PGE(2)-induced hyperalgesia were evaluated in the absence and in the presence of l-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and glibenclamide, an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive potassium channels.
The extract showed significant antinociceptive effects in persistent pain induced by CFA and on neuropathic pain induced by PLSN. The effects of Dioscorea bulbifera persisted for 5 days after two administrations in CFA-induced hypernociception. Dioscorea bulbifera significantly inhibited acute LPS-induced pain but failed to reduce thermal hypernociception and capsaicin-induced spontaneous nociception. The antinociceptive effects of this plant extract in PGE(2) model was antagonized by either l-NAME or glibenclamide.
Present demonstrate the antinociceptive activities of Dioscorea bulbifera both in inflammatory and neuropathic models of pain and these effects may result, at least partially, from its ability to activate the NO-cGMP-ATP-sensitive potassium channels pathway.
Several evidences have pointed to biochemical alterations in some brain structures after experimental Status Epilepticus (SE). Thus, the effects of pilocarpine-induced SE on the glutamate binding in the hippocampus and cortex of Wistar rats were evaluated. Groups of animals were submitted to a 3h SE induced by intrahippocampal microinjection of pilocarpine, which was interrupted by the administration of sodium thiopental. Two weeks later the animals were sacrificed and had their cerebral cortices and hippocampi removed in order to perform the binding experiments. The results show that the pilocarpine-induced SE provoked an increase in 2.5-fold in the B(max) values for glutamate binding in the cortex, but not in the hippocampus. Moreover, we observed a 4-fold increase for the Kd values in the hippocampus and a 2-fold increase in the cortex. These findings might indicate that the epileptogenesis involves alterations in the glutamate receptors that are not restricted to the limbic system. Moreover, changes in these receptors are not exclusively of number, but rather involve the affinity for their ligands.
Two children developed hepatotoxicity during treatment for right-sided Wilms Tumor. Treatment consisted of nephrectomy, irradiation, and chemotherapy with actinomycin D and vincristine. Hepatic enlargement, thrombocytopenia, and abnormalities in liver function and seen on the liver scan occurred at the time of the course of chemotherapy administered 20 days after completion of irradiation. These abnormalities disappeared when treatment was temporarily suspended. Vincristine and actinomycin D were subsequently reintroduced without evidence of hepatotoxicity. Actinomycin D after irradiation for right-sided Wilms tumor may produce severe liver toxicity.
The anti-inflammatory agents are postulated to be effective in treating neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we showed that indomethacin (IND) in the dose of 1 mg/kg protected neurons against toxic damage caused by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in mice model of Parkinson's disease. IND also diminished microglial activation and lymphocytic infiltration in the injured areas. These observations suggest that anti-inflammatory properties of IND may play a role in the neuron's protection in this model. However, diminished inflammatory reaction may be secondary to less neuronal damage.
Hemolytic anemia occurred in a 70-year-old female after a five-day course of intravenous cefamandole. The patient's serum contained an IgG antibody which was reactive with red blood cells which had been coated in vitro with cefamandole but not with uncoated cells. An in vitro assay of allogeneic mononuclear phagocytosis of cefamandole-coated red cells sensitized with the patient's anti-cefamandole indicated that the anti-cefamandole could induce significant phagocytosis. The anti-cefamandole was easily inhibited in vitro by cefamandole as well as by a variety of related cephalosporins indicating broad cross-reactivity, with the antigenic site primarily the 7-amino-cephalosporanic acid nucleus. Penicillins could inhibit the anti-cefamandole but only when using concentrations 3-10 X those of cephalosporins. Eleven examples of anti-penicillin tested failed to react with cefamandole-coated red cells. Screening of 344 random sera from hospitalized patients found only five (1.5%) reactive with cefamandole-coated red cells; three of these sera were also reactive with penicillin-coated red cells. The patient's hemolysis subsided following cessation of the drug. This is the first report of anti-cefamandole-induced hemolytic anemia.
A case of adriamycin-induced carciomyopathy in a 5 3/4-year-old girl with metastatic Wilms tumor is reported. Potentiation of the adriamycin cardiotoxicity by irradiation to the heart is proposed; the clinical and pathologic findings are discussed.
In the ESTEEM study, patients with a recent myocardial infarction were treated with aspirin and randomized to one of four doses (24-60 mg b.i.d) of the oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran or placebo for 6 months. Ximelagatran and aspirin reduced the risk of recurrent ischemic events compared with aspirin alone. In the present substudy we evaluated the different doses of ximelagatran on pharmacokinetics as measured by plasma concentration of the active compound melagatran and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and pharmacodynamics as related by markers for coagulation activity, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) and D-dimer.
Plasma samples from 518 patients were collected before, during and after the treatment period. There was a linear dose-concentration relation at peak and trough and a linear relation between concentration and APTT (P < 0.001). F1 + 2 and D-dimer were decreased by 25% and 52% at 1 week (P < 0.001) in the ximelagatran groups compared with the placebo group and the reductions were maintained during the 6 months treatment. There were no differences detected in F1 + 2 or D-dimer levels between the different ximelagatran dosages. There was no correlation between the melagatran concentration and the change in F1 + 2 and D-dimer levels. After cessation of ximelagatran F1 + 2 and D-dimer levels returned to the initial levels.
The dose of ximelagatran and APTT are linearly related to the plasma concentration of melagatran. Ximelagatran induces a sustained and stable reduction of thrombin generation and fibrin turnover without any relation to dose above 24 mg b.i.d. These properties indicate that long-term treatment with a low dose of ximelagatran may provide valuable depression of coagulation activity in aspirin treated post myocardial infarction patients.
Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy and like other psychostimulants has a potential for abuse.
A young man with a cerebral lacunar infarction following chronic oral abuse of methylphenidate is presented.
The experience of our patient and a review of the literature suggest that cerebral infarction is a potential side effect of chronic consumption of methylphenidate.
The effect of age on basal and stimulated noradrenaline release in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the rat was examined by in vivo microdialysis. Microdialysis probes were inserted into the PVN of 3 and 18 month old anaesthetised Sprague Dawley rats and perfused with a modified Ringer solution. Following four basal 30-min collections, transmitter release was stimulated by perfusion with 100 mM potassium for one collection. After re-equilibration, blood pressure was raised 60 mmHg for 30 min by phenylephrine infusion (1-1.3 mg/kg) then a 2-h recovery period followed. Dialysate collections were injected directly onto a reverse phase HPLC-ECD (HPLC with electrochemical detection). Basal extracellular noradrenaline concentrations were found to be similar in adult and old animals. Basal dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) concentrations were significantly greater in old compared to adult rats (P < 0.05). Potassium depolarisation induced a significant increase in noradrenaline concentrations in both age groups (P < 0.001), however the noradrenaline response to potassium stimulation was significantly reduced in the aged rats (P < 0.05). Potassium-induced decreases in DOPAC and homovanillic acid (HVA) concentrations were seen in both age groups. Following phenylephrine infusion, a modest delayed reduction in noradrenaline levels, which failed to reach statistical significance, was seen. Phenylephrine-induced hypertension was associated with decreased DOPAC and HVA concentrations in adult (P < 0.05) and old (P < 0.05) rats, respectively. These results indicate that ageing is associated with changes in dopaminergic and noradrenergic activity in the PVN of the rat. A reduction in noradrenaline response to maximal stimulation induced by potassium depolarisation was observed with ageing. The alteration in the activity of the catecholaminergic pathways to the PVN induced by phenylephrine infusion appears to be age dependent.
The widely adopted use of tamoxifen as a chemotherapeutic agent is primarily based on its inhibition of cancer cell growth. However, we report that tamoxifen at low concentrations (10(-9) and 10(-11) M) causes stimulation of cell proliferation in a cervical cancer cell line, SFR. The facts that SFR cells do not contain estrogen receptors and are estrogen nonresponsive imply the existence of an antiestrogen-specific binding protein and suggest that the effect of tamoxifen is possibly mediated through a pathway other than estrogen receptors. Tamoxifen at low concentrations stimulated human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) gene transcription and E7 protein production. Levels of HPV-16 mRNA and E7 protein reached a peak at approximately 2-4 h after tamoxifen treatment, persisted for several hours, and subsequently decreased to their prestimulation levels by about 24 h after treatment. Our results indicate for the first time that tamoxifen stimulates cell proliferation of cervical cancer cells, and we suggest that the enhanced HPV-16 mRNA and E7 protein levels are probably responsible.
Patients with upper gastrointestinal ulceration may be treated with misoprostol, but it is not recommended for pregnant women because it may stimulate uterine contractions and cause vaginal bleeding and miscarriage. Recent data from Brazil, where misoprostol is used orally and vaginally as an abortifacient, have suggested a relation between the use of misoprostol by women in an unsuccessful attempt to terminate pregnancy and Möbius' syndrome (congenital facial paralysis) in their infants.
We compared the frequency of misoprostol use during the first trimester by mothers of infants in whom Möbius' syndrome was diagnosed and mothers of infants with neural-tube defects in Brazil. All diagnoses in infants were made between January 16, 1990, and May 31, 1996, by clinical geneticists at seven hospitals who also interviewed the mothers and recorded information about the administration of misoprostol, among other data.
We identified 96 infants with Möbius' syndrome and matched them with 96 infants with neural-tube defects. The mean age at the time of the diagnosis of Möbius' syndrome was 16 months (range, 0.5 to 78), and the diagnosis of neural-tube defects was made within 1 week of birth in most cases. Among the mothers of the 96 infants with Möbius' syndrome, 47 (49 percent) had used misoprostol in the first trimester of pregnancy, as compared with 3 (3 percent) of the mothers of the 96 infants with neural-tube defects (odds ratio, 29.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 11.6 to 76.0). Twenty of the mothers of the infants with Möbius' syndrome had taken misoprostol only orally (odds ratio, 38.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.5 to 159.4), 20 had taken misoprostol both orally and vaginally, 3 had taken the drug vaginally, and 4 did not report how they took the drug.
Attempted abortion with misoprostol is associated with an increased risk of Möbius' syndrome in infants.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is primarily characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic systemic exposure of Lewis rats to rotenone produced many features of PD, and cerebral tauopathy was also detected in the case of severe weight loss. The present study was designed to assess the neurotoxicity of rotenone after daily oral administration for 28 days at several doses in C57BL/6 mice. In addition, we examined the protective effects of 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) on nigral dopamine (DA) neurons in rotenone-treated mice. 4-PBA was injected intraperitoneally daily 30 min before each oral administration of rotenone. Chronic oral administration of rotenone at high doses induced specific nigrostriatal DA neurodegeneration, motor deficits and the up-regulation of alpha-synuclein in the surviving DA neurons. In contrast to the Lewis rat model, cerebral tauopathy was not detected in this mouse model. 4-PBA inhibited rotenone-induced neuronal death and decreased the protein level of alpha-synuclein. These results suggest that this rotenone mouse model may be useful for understanding the mechanism of DA neurodegeneration in PD, and that 4-PBA has a neuroprotective effect in the treatment of PD.
The patient, a manic depressive who was treated with lithium for three years, suddenly developed severe neurotoxicity and a glomerulonephritis-like syndrome. The author believes that the lithium toxicity was facilitated by hot weather with excessive sweating, gall bladder pathology with fever, and decreased water and salt intake. The patient improved except for a persistent hypertension. Propranolol not only improved the hypertension but alleviated a lithium-induced tremor as well.
In patients with metabolic alkalosis, compensatory alveolar hypoventilation may induce hypercapnia and hypoxemia. In edematous or normally-hydrated patients without electrolyte deficiencies, acetazolamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been advocated to correct the primary acid-base disturbance, thereby preventing hypoxemia. The hemodynamic consequences and the effect on oxyhemoglobin dissociation of acetazolamide, were studied. Twelve critically ill patients with metabolic alkalosis were given 15 mg/kg body wt. acetazolamide intravenously. Cardiovascular performance was completely unchanged. The P50 was 26.6 mm Hg at the beginning and the end of the study, indicating that hemoglobin-oxygen affinity is unaffected by acetazolamide. In six patients, investigated after open-heart surgery, the arterial oxygen tension increased by 10-45%. This was probably related to the combined effects of slight reductions in total body oxygen consumption or shunting of venous blood through the lungs. Eight of the 12 patients were on controlled ventilation. After acetazolamide there was a mean increase in mixed venous carbon dioxide tension (PvCO2) of 4.5 mm Hg, with no increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), indicating only a limited interference with carbon dioxide uptake and release of the carbonic anhydrase inhibition. No other adverse reactions were observed.
Renal failure resulting from cocaine abuse has been well documented, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be investigated. In the present study, primary cultured human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HPTECs) of the kidney were used to investigate its ability to metabolize cocaine, as well as the cytotoxicity induced by cocaine and its metabolites benzoylecgonine (BE), ecgonine methyl ester (EME) and norcocaine (NCOC). Gas chromatography/ion trap-mass spectrometry (GC/IT-MS) analysis of HPTECs exposed to cocaine (1 mM) for 72 h confirmed its metabolism into EME and NCOC, but not BE. EME levels increased along the exposure time to cocaine, while NCOC concentration diminished after reaching a maximum at 6 h, indicating a possible secondary metabolism for this metabolite. Cocaine promoted a concentration-dependent loss of cell viability, whereas BE and EME were found to be non-toxic to HPTECs at the tested conditions. In contrast, NCOC revealed to have higher intrinsic nephrotoxicity than the parent compound. Moreover, cocaine-induced cell death was partially reversed in the presence of ketoconazole (KTZ), a potent CYP3A inhibitor, supporting the hypothesis that NCOC may play a role in cocaine-induced nephrotoxicity. Cocaine-induced cytotoxicity was found to involve intracellular glutathione depletion at low concentrations and to induce mitochondrial damage at higher concentrations. Under the present experimental conditions, HPTECs death pathway followed an apoptotic pattern, which was evident for concentrations as low as 0.1 mM.
The efficacy of long-term adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy or combination of adefovir and lamivudine in hepatitis B e antigen (HBe-Ag)-negative lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients is still under investigation.
To assess the safety and efficacy of the long-term adefovir treatment alone or in combination with lamivudine in HBe-Ag-negative CHB patients who had developed breakthrough because of lamivudine-resistant mutants.
Fifty-nine patients received combination therapy, while 23 switched to adefovir alone after a 3-month course of combination therapy.
The median follow-up after adefovir's onset was 31 (18-40) months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. At 12 and 24 months, 69% and 89% of patients receiving combination therapy and 73% and 82% of patients receiving adefovir monotherapy had serum HBV-DNA <10(4) copies/mL (P > 0.5). Normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels occurred in 81% and 79% of patients receiving combination vs. 61% and 53% receiving adefovir monotherapy at 12 and 24 months, respectively (P > 0.50). Virological breakthroughs because of adefovir-resistant mutants occurred in five patients under adefovir monotherapy and in none receiving combination therapy (P = 0.001). No one developed decompensated liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma during follow-up. Re-introduction of lamivudine in adefovir-resistant patients achieved reduction in HBV-DNA and biochemical remission, but re-emergence of lamivudine mutants was observed in one patient after 7.5 months.
In HBe-Ag-negative CHB patients with lamivudine resistance, adding adefovir to continuing lamivudine therapy maximizes anti-viral efficacy because of absence of viral resistance.
Uncertainty exists as to the most appropriate dose of haloperidol in first-episode psychosis. This study set out to determine whether ultra-low doses of haloperidol could successfully treat patients with first-episode psychosis. Thirty-five patients with a first episode of psychosis were treated with haloperidol in an open label, fixed protocol over a 12-week period with doses restricted to 1 mg per day for the first 4 weeks. Twenty-nine (83%) remained on haloperidol after 12 weeks at a mean dose of 1.78 mg per day, 16 (55%) had stabilized on 1 mg/day or less. The mean percentage reduction in Positive and Negative Symptom Scale score between baseline and 6 and 12 weeks was 30.3% (SD 20.9%) and 41.4% (SD 16.6%), respectively. There were no significant differences in mean extrapyramidal symptom ratings between baseline and 12 weeks. Ultra-low doses of haloperidol are effective and well tolerated in first-episode psychosis. Initial doses should be maintained for a sufficient period of time to allow for the medication to take full effect.
Pbx1, a homeodomain transcription factor that was originally identified as the product of a proto-oncogene in acute pre-B-cell leukemia, is a global regulator of embryonic development. However, embryonic lethality in its absence has prevented an assessment of its role in B-cell development. Here, using Rag1-deficient blastocyst complementation assays, we demonstrate that Pbx1 null embryonic stem (ES) cells fail to generate common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) resulting in a complete lack of B and NK cells, and a partial impairment of T-cell development in chimeric mice. A critical role for Pbx1 was confirmed by rescue of B-cell development from CLPs following restoration of its expression in Pbx1-deficient ES cells. In adoptive transfer experiments, B-cell development from Pbx1-deficient fetal liver cells was also severely compromised, but not erased, since transient B lymphopoiesis was detected in Rag-deficient recipients. Conditional inactivation of Pbx1 in pro-B (CD19(+)) cells and thereafter revealed that Pbx1 is not necessary for B-cell development to proceed from the pro-B-cell stage. Thus, Pbx1 critically functions at a stage between hematopoietic stem cell development and B-cell commitment and, therefore, is one of the earliest-acting transcription factors that regulate de novo B-lineage lymphopoiesis.
Ribavirin is ineffective against hepatitis C virus as mono-therapy but is critical in attaining both early virologic response and sustained virologic response when combined with pegylated interferon. Ribavirin has significant dose-limiting toxicities, the most important of which is hemolytic anemia. Taribavirin is a ribavirin pro-drug, which targets the liver and has less incidence of anemia, and it may be a promising alternative to ribavirin in the future.
Depression and anxiety have been associated with interferon treatment and low treatment adherence.
To study the incidence and associated risk factors of depressive and anxiety disorders during pegylated interferon plus ribavirin and treatment adherence in a prospective cohort of 176 patients with chronic hepatitis C patients.
Patients were interviewed at baseline using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Mental Disorders and the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were completed. Both questionnaires were completed also after 4, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment.
De novo depressive and/or anxiety disorders were diagnosed in 53 (36%) patients, in whom antidepressants and/or anxiolytics were administered. Higher baseline depression-subscale score (OR = 27.8, 95% CI = 2.82-333), primary education level (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.40-7.03) and being an immigrant (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.12-9.47) were predictors of psychiatric disorders during anti-viral therapy. The percentage of patients with good adherence was lower in those with depression and/or anxiety (79% vs. 90%, P < 0.04). Only one patient (1%) discontinued treatment because of a major depressive episode. Depression and/or anxiety disorders had no effect on attainment of sustained virological response.
Early detection and treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders favours good adherence to anti-viral treatment in hepatitis C.
