In antidiuresis, vasopressin (AVP) occupation of V2 receptors in renal collecting ducts activates adenylyl cyclase, resulting in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates both the cAMP responsive element binding protein, which induces aquaporin-2 (AQP2) transcription, and AQP2, which then is translocated to the apical membrane, allowing urine concentration. Lithium treatment often causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), which coincides with decreased AQP2 expression and which generally is ascribed to reduced adenylyl cyclase activity. However, the underlying mechanism by which lithium causes NDI is poorly understood. This study demonstrated that the mouse cortical collecting duct mpkCCD(c14) cells are a good model; the deamino-8 D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP)-induced endogenous AQP2 expression and plasma membrane localization was time-dependently reduced by treatment with clinically relevant lithium concentrations. Lithium did not affect AQP2 stability but decreased its mRNA levels. Surprising, the effect of lithium was cAMP independent; it did not alter AVP-stimulated cAMP production or PKA-dependent phosphorylation of AQP2 or cAMP responsive element binding protein. In vivo, kidney tissue of rats with lithium-induced NDI indeed generated less dDAVP-induced cAMP than that of controls, but this could be due to elevated blood AVP levels in rats with lithium-induced NDI. Indeed, Brattleboro rats, which lack endogenous AVP, with clamped blood dDAVP levels, showed no difference in dDAVP-generated cAMP generation between kidneys of rats with lithium-induced NDI and control rats. In conclusion, the first proper cell model to study lithium-induced NDI was developed, and it was demonstrated that the lithium-induced downregulation of AQP2 and development of NDI occur independent of adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro and in vivo.
During an asymptomatic phase platelet MAO activity was examined in 28 unipolar patients, 8 of whom previously had developed mania during clomipramine treatment for depression. The platelet MAO activity was not lower in these switchers than in 20 unipolar patients who did not become manic during a similar clomipramine treatment. High but nonsignificant correlations were found among platelet MAO activity and age of onset of mania, duration of clomipramine treatment before the switch, and the duration of manic behavior. These clinical variables correlated significantly amongst themselves. The high and normal platelet MAO activities of these patients neither support nor rule out a Bipolar I diagnosis. This study supports the pharmacologic basic of the induction of mania during clomipramine treatment.
Rosacea is a common skin condition thought to be primarily an inflammatory disorder. Neutrophils, in particular, have been implicated in the inflammation associated with rosacea and mediate many of their effects through the release of reactive oxygen species. Recently, the role of reactive oxygen species in the pathophysiology of rosacea has been recognized. Many effective agents for rosacea, including topical azelaic acid and topical metronidazole, have anti-inflammatory properties. in-vitro models have demonstrated the potent antioxidant effects of azelaic acid, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for its efficacy in the treatment of rosacea.
The aims of this study were to investigate the viral differences among lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes B and C in vivo. Fifty-three patients carrying lamivudine-resistant HBV were enrolled in this study. HBV genotypes, Levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HBV DNA levels were monitored during therapy. The polymerase and precore/core promoter genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and their products were sequenced directly. Among 53 patients resistant HBV genotypes B and C accounted for 41.50% and 58.50%, respectively. The occurrence of reverse transcriptase rt204I mutants was lower in genotype B (36.36%) than that in genotype C (87.10%), whereas rt204V mutants was higher in genotype B (63.64%) than that in genotype C (12.90%). The occurrence of precore mutation (nt1896A) was higher in genotype B (77.27%) than that in genotype C (32.26%). Serum HBV DNA levels after emergence of lamivudine resistance were higher in genotype C (7.71 +/- 0.80 Log copies/mL) compared with genotype B (6.97 +/- 0.77 Log copies/mL). Multivariate analysis identified pretreatment HBV DNA levels, HBeAg status and HBV genotype as independent factors associated with a shorter time to lamivudine resistance(P = 0.035, P = 0.006 and P = 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that HBV genotype (P = 0.004) and pretreatment ALT levels (P = 0.01) was independently associated with YMDD mutational patterns. The results showed that the YMDD mutational patterns, precore mutation and serum HBV DNA levels differ between lamivudine-resistant HBV genotypes B and C in vivo. It is valuable for treatment of lamivudine-resistant HBV in clinic.
Family history is a significant risk factor for prostate cancer, although the molecular basis for this association is poorly understood. Linkage studies have implicated chromosome 17q21-22 as a possible location of a prostate-cancer susceptibility gene.
We screened more than 200 genes in the 17q21-22 region by sequencing germline DNA from 94 unrelated patients with prostate cancer from families selected for linkage to the candidate region. We tested family members, additional case subjects, and control subjects to characterize the frequency of the identified mutations.
Probands from four families were discovered to have a rare but recurrent mutation (G84E) in HOXB13 (rs138213197), a homeobox transcription factor gene that is important in prostate development. All 18 men with prostate cancer and available DNA in these four families carried the mutation. The carrier rate of the G84E mutation was increased by a factor of approximately 20 in 5083 unrelated subjects of European descent who had prostate cancer, with the mutation found in 72 subjects (1.4%), as compared with 1 in 1401 control subjects (0.1%) (P=8.5x10(-7)). The mutation was significantly more common in men with early-onset, familial prostate cancer (3.1%) than in those with late-onset, nonfamilial prostate cancer (0.6%) (P=2.0x10(-6)).
The novel HOXB13 G84E variant is associated with a significantly increased risk of hereditary prostate cancer. Although the variant accounts for a small fraction of all prostate cancers, this finding has implications for prostate-cancer risk assessment and may provide new mechanistic insights into this common cancer.

We report a case of haemolytic due to the use of piperacillin-tazobactam in a 50-year-old woman. Since 2002 4 other cases were reported. Either the presence of piperacillin as tazobactam can induce haemolysis. In all cases discontinuating the drugs resolves the haemolysis. Although drug-induced haemolytic anaemia due to piperacillin-tazobactam is rare, the common use of this antibioticum in the critical care setting should alert the physician as a possible culprit in cases of haemolytic anaemia.
We previously showed that endothelin-1 expression was increased in vascular endothelium of deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats, whereas in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) it is similar to or less than that in normotensive rats. Treatment with the combined endothelin type A/endothelin type B receptor antagonist bosentan moderately reduced blood pressure rise and nearly completely blunted the development of vascular hypertrophy, particularly in small arteries, in the deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive model, suggesting a paracrine role for vascular endothelin-1 in the induction of blood vessel hypertrophy in some forms of experimental hypertension. In the present study we examined the effect of chronic oral treatment for 4 weeks of 12-week-old SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) with 100 mg/kg per day bosentan. Blood pressure rose to hypertensive levels similarly in bosentan-treated and untreated SHR; systolic pressure of WKY was also unaffected. The wet weights of the heart, of aortic segments, and of the mesenteric arterial bed were similar in treated and untreated SHR. When coronary, renal arcuate, mesenteric, and femoral small arteries were evaluated on a wire myograph, the media width and media-to-lumen ratio were greater and the lumen diameter was smaller in vessels from SHR relative to those from WKY, except in small arteries from the renal cortex, in which the lumen was not significantly different in both strains. The media cross-sectional area of small arteries fom the four vascular beds was similar in both strains. Identical morphometric parameters were found in the four vascular beds in bosentan-treated and untreated rats of eh strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
A 41-year-old woman who was undergoing oral chemotherapy with capecitabine for metastatic breast cancer presented with recurrent episodes of chest pain associated with electrocardiographic signs of diffuse ST segment elevation. After spontaneous pain relief, the electrocardiogram showed ischemic evolution in the anterior precordial leads. Coronary and ventricular angiography, performed 24 h later, showed normal coronary arteries and normal left ventricular function. After therapy with capecitabine was discontinued, the patient did not experience further episodes of chest pain. After a nine-month follow-up, she remains alive, with a good performance status and without clinical evidence of persistent ischemia.
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine and mediator of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. MIF is overexpressed in various tumours and has been suggested as a molecular link between chronic inflammation and cancer. MIF overexpression is observed in breast cancer but its causal role in the development of this tumour entity is unclear.
MIF levels in breast cancer cell lines were determined by ELISA and Western blot. CD74 was measured by Western blot, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Cell proliferation was studied by BrdU incorporation, cell adhesion by Matrigel adhesion assay, and cell invasion by migration assay through Matrigel-coated filters using the Transwell system. MIF expression in primary human breast cancers was measured by tissue microarray and a semi-quantitative immunoreactivity score (IRS) and comparison with histopathological parameters and patient outcome data.
MIF was abundantly expressed in the non-invasive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468 and ZR-75-1, but not in invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, which in turn expressed higher levels of the MIF-receptor CD74. Stimulation with exogenous MIF led to a dramatic upregulation of MIF secretion (50-fold) in MDA-MB-231 cells. Autocrine MIF promoted tumour cell proliferation, as indicated by blockade of MIF or CD74 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 invasiveness was enhanced by exogenous MIF. We correlated the expression of MIF with histopathological parameters and patient outcome data, using a tissue microarray of 175 primary invasive breast cancers and 35 normal control tissues. MIF was upregulated in breast cancer versus normal tissue (median IRS = 8 versus 6). MIF expression showed positive correlations with progesterone (p = 0.006) and estrogen (p = 0.028) receptor expression, markers of a favourable prognosis and a negative correlation to tumour size (p = 0.007). In line with these data, disease-specific overall (OS) as well as recurrence-free (RFS) survival was significantly improved in breast cancer patients with abundant cytosolic MIF expression compared to MIF low expressers (5-year OS = 67% versus 50%, p = 0.0019; 5-year RFS = 52% versus 36%, p = 0.0327).
We conclude that intracellular expression of MIF in breast cancer cells is beneficial, whereas extracellular MIF may play a pro-oncogenic role in promoting breast cancer cell-stroma interactions.
A patient with systemic lupus erythematosus had chills, fever, and headache on four separate occasions after ibuprofen ingestion. One such episode was accompanied by cerebrospinal fluid findings compatible with meningitis. Drug rechallenge under controlled conditions established the relationship between ibuprofen ingestion and meningitis.
The endogenous opioid system is often assumed to play a role in vulnerability to drug abuse. However, controversial results have been reported regarding the levels of enkephalins or preproenkephalin in neurons of rodent brains after opiate administration. The present study was performed to determine the extracellular levels of enkephalins and its physiological antagonist cholecystokinin (CCK), using in vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats after morphine-induced physical dependence or positive place conditioning. A large increase (340%) of Met-enkephalin was observed in the periaqueductal gray matter, a structure involved in morphine withdrawal syndrome, in morphine-dependent rats. No change in CCK immunoreactivity occurred in these conditions. Moreover, using the conditioning place preference paradigm, we observed for the first time opposite changes of enkephalin outflow in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Thus, an increase in enkephalin levels was observed in rats placed in the drug-associated compartment and a decrease in the saline-paired side. These changes in opioid peptides in the NAc may reflect an "emotional state" of the animals in relation to the expectation of drug reward (reinforcing effects of morphine). Moreover, the lack of regulation in CCK outflow suggests that CCK-opioid interactions in morphine dependence involve probably post-receptor events.
Chloroform, dichloroacetic acid (DCA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) are mouse liver carcinogens that are chlorine disinfection by-products found in drinking water. The effect of chloroform on DCA and TCA-induced hypomethylation and expression of the c-myc gene and on their promotion of liver and kidney tumors was determined. B6C3F1 mice were administered 0, 400, 800 and 1600 mg/l chloroform in drinking water and 500 mg/kg DCA or TCA-administered daily by gavage. DCA, TCA and to a lesser extent chloroform decreased the methylation and increased the mRNA expression of the c-myc gene. Co-administering chloroform prevented only DCA and not TCA-induced hypomethylation and increased mRNA expression of the gene. The effect of chloroform on tumor promotion by DCA and TCA was determined in female and male B6C3F1 mice initiated on day 15 of age with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Starting at 5 weeks of age, the mice received in their drinking water DCA (3.2 g/l) or TCA (4.0 g/l) with 0, 800 or 1600 mg/l chloroform until they were killed at 36 weeks. Liver tumors promoted by DCA and TCA were predominantly basophilic except for DCA-treated female mice that were eosinophilic. Only DCA promoted foci of altered hepatocytes and they were eosinophilic in both sexes. Chloroform prevented DCA, but not TCA promotion of liver foci and tumors. In male mice, TCA promoted kidney tumors while DCA promoted kidney tumors only when co-administered with chloroform. Hence, chloroform prevented the hypomethylation and increased mRNA expression of the c-myc gene and the promotion of liver tumors by DCA, while enhancing DCA-promotion of kidney tumors. Thus, the concurrent exposure to two carcinogens, chloroform and DCA resulted in less than additive activity in one organ and synergism in another organ.
Sulfadiazine-related stones are uncommonly reported, but they could be increasingly encountered owing to the use of sulfadiazine for human immunodeficiency virus-related toxoplasmosis. We report on their unusual imaging characteristics, with 4 such stones having very low attenuation compared with more commonly encountered stones. Because their atypical appearance resulted in delayed treatment for our patient in acute renal failure and because the computed tomography imaging characteristics have not been previously defined, we report the findings of stone analysis-confirmed sulfadiazine-related urolithiasis.
Emergency room visits related to cocaine use have been increasing over the past 10 years, with the cost of cocaine-related hospitalization now more than 80 million dollars per year. Well-recognized and common complications associated with cocaine use include hypertension, cardiac ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents and rhabdomyolysis. Renal infarction is uncommon, while aortic involvement is even less documented in literature. We present the first report of a case of renal infarction and aortic thrombus in a patient who used nasal cocaine. This case suggests that aortic pathology should be considered in patients presenting with renal infarction related to cocaine use.
Cocaine abuse can cause degenerative and inflammatory alterations of the myocardium. Cocaine-induced myocarditis has been previously described, but mostly in chronic cocaine addicts. Among several pathogenetic mechanisms of cocaine-related myocardial damage, the myocardial adrenergic stress and cardiomyocytes apoptosis have been recently proposed. We report an unusual case of myocarditis involving the bundle of His and left bundle branch and cardiac myocytes apoptosis in otherwise healthy occasional cocaine abuser.
Heme oxygenase (HO) and carbon monoxide (CO) participate in the homeostatic control of cardiovascular functions, including the regulation of blood pressure (BP). Upregulation of the HO/CO system has been shown to lower BP in young (8 weeks) but not in adult (20 weeks) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The underlying mechanism for this selective effect, however, has been unknown and was investigated in the present study. The administration of hemin resulted in a marked decrease in BP (from 148.6+/-3.2 to 125.8+/-2.6 mm Hg, P<0.01) in young but not in prehypertensive (4 weeks) or adult SHR or Wistar-Kyoto rats at all ages. The inhibition of HO with chromium mesoporphyrin abrogated the BP-lowering effect of hemin. Significantly lower expression levels of HO-1 and soluble gyanylyl cyclase (sGC) as well as reduced cGMP content were detected in 8-week SHR but not in adult SHR or Wistar-Kyoto rats of all ages. These deficiencies were all corrected by hemin treatment. The expression of HO-2 protein was not different among all animal groups tested and not affected by hemin treatment. Desensitization of the sGC/cGMP pathway in adult SHR was demonstrated by the reduced vasorelaxant potency of the sGC activator 3-(5' -hydroxymethyl-2-'furyl)-1-benzylindazole. Thus, in young and prehypertensive SHR, a defective HO/CO-sGC/cGMP system might constitute a pathogenic mechanism for the development of hypertension. The HO/CO-sGC/cGMP system appears normal in adult SHR, but desensitization of the downstream targets of the system to sGC/cGMP may endow SHR at this stage a persistent hypertension status.
European flounder (Platichthys flesus) has shown an increased prevalence of liver tumors and lymphocystis disease (a viral infection) that correlated with pollution in field research in Dutch coastal and estuarine waters. Semi-field or mesocosm experiments confirmed the supposed causality. Although these types of research are highly relevant for the feral population, laboratory experiments are necessary to establish causal relationships between specific chemical pollutants and disease. Therefore, the effects on flounder of some of the potentially causative chemicals such as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), dimethyl-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 3,3',4,4',5 pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126), and bis(tri-n-butyltin)oxide (TBTO) were examined in several laboratory experiments. These effects were evaluated using general toxicological parameters and histopathology. For immune function assessment, attempts to develop an infection model with the lymphocystis virus were made, but appeared unsuccessful and immune function tests are not fully operational at the moment. Flounder has been successfully maintained and exposed to toxic substances in captivity in our laboratory. Short-term aqueous exposure to high levels of BaP or DMBA did not induce marked effects under our experimental conditions. Results of oral exposure of flounder to low levels of TCDD, PCB-126 or harbor sludge extract show significant induction of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) in hepatocytes. Oral exposure to high levels of TCDD or PCB-126 also significantly induced CYP1A immunoreactivity in epithelium in mesonephros and digestive tract and in endothelium in several organs. Remarkable was the induction of CYP1A in a distinct population of mononuclear cells in the mesonephros. Moreover, oral exposure to TCDD resulted in an increased mitotic activity and an increase of the hepatosomatic index in the 20 and 500 microgram TCDD/kg group respectively. Therefore, exposure to TCDD and related substances may promote the development of liver tumors in the field. Exposure to PCB-126 also significantly reduced the relative thymus volume, but other results indicate that flounder is relatively insensitive to this type of chemicals. Short-term aqueous exposure of flounder to TBTO, in concentrations that were in the same order of magnitude as upper TBT levels measured in the field, caused mortality after 7-12 days associated with gill lesions, and induced reduction of the non-specific resistance and decrease of the relative thymus volume. From these results we therefore conclude that TBTO might play a causal role in, for instance, increased prevalence of lymphocystis virus infections in the field
To identify novel pathways mediating molecular mechanisms of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in humans, we assessed gene expression in adipose and muscle tissue from six subjects with type 2 diabetes before and after 8 weeks of treatment with rosiglitazone. mRNA was analyzed using Total Gene Expression Analysis (TOGA), an automated restriction-based cDNA display method with quantitative analysis of PCR products. The expression of cell cycle regulatory transcription factors E2F4 and the MAGE protein necdin were similarly altered in all subjects after rosiglitazone treatment. E2F4 expression was decreased by 10-fold in muscle and 2.5-fold in adipose tissue; necdin was identified in adipose tissue only and increased 1.8-fold after TZD treatment. To determine whether changes were related to an effect of the drug or adipogenesis, we evaluated the impact of rosiglitazone and differentiation independently in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. While treatment of differentiated adipocytes with rosiglitazone did not alter E2F4 or necdin, expression of both genes was significantly altered during differentiation. Differentiation was associated with increased cytosolic localization of E2F4. Moreover, necdin overexpression potently inhibited adipocyte differentiation and cell cycle progression. These data suggest that changes in necdin and E2F4 expression after rosiglitazone exposure in humans are associated with altered adipocyte differentiation and may contribute to improved insulin sensitivity in humans treated with TZDs.
To determine if modafinil, a putative treatment for cocaine dependence, influences the pharmacokinetics of intravenous cocaine in otherwise healthy cocaine-dependent volunteers.
Cocaine 20 or 40 mg was administered intravenously on consecutive days over 1 minute at baseline and after modafinil administration at each of two dosages of 400 and 800 mg/day for 7 days.
Twelve subjects completed the clinical protocol. Compared with baseline, the cocaine peak plasma concentration was decreased after both the 20 and 40 mg cocaine infusions, but the reduction was only statistically significant after the 40 mg cocaine infusion (p < 0.01 after modafinil 400 mg/day; p < 0.05 after modafinil 800 mg/day). The area under the cocaine plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 180 minutes (AUC180) was significantly decreased by modafinil administration (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 for modafinil 400 and 800 mg/day, respectively, for the cocaine 20mg dose; p < 0.001 for the cocaine 40 mg dose at both modafinil levels). There were no significant changes in total AUC, clearance or elimination half-life of cocaine.
This study did not find evidence for a harmful pharmacokinetic interaction between modafinil and cocaine. In contrast, long-term administration of modafinil significantly decreased systemic exposure to cocaine during the first 180 minutes following intravenous cocaine administration.
With enteral administration to dogs of equitherapeutic doses (pyrazidol-25 mg/kg, imizin-15 mg/kg) pyrazidol did not provoke myocardial ischemia caused by imizin (imipramin). ECG changes in rats following introduction of pyrazidol and imizin show the latter to call forth more marked upsets on the level of the cardio-vascular system than does pyrazidol. In a concentration of 3-10-6 g/ml the latter lengthens the refractory period of an isolated rabbit's cardiac auricle by 12.6 per cent on an average, while imizin in the same concentration does it by 34 per cent. In acute tests on cats pyrazidol produces a less pronounced hypotension than does imizin.
