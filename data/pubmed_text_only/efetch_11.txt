In 1984, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group began a randomized controlled clinical trial of patients with advanced (stage III or IV) diffuse mixed or diffuse large-cell lymphoma to determine whether complete-remission rates, survival, and toxicity differed when patients were treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen containing cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), as compared with a regimen containing bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dexamethasone, methotrexate, and leucovorin (m-BACOD).
From July 1984 through January 1988, 392 patients were enrolled, 325 of whom (83 percent) were eligible for the analysis and capable of being evaluated. The extent of disease was defined according to standard staging techniques, including bilateral bone-core biopsies in 88 percent of patients. Randomization was stratified according to age (< 60 or > or = 60 years), performance status (0, 1, or other), stage (III or IV), and histologic presentation (diffuse mixed or diffuse large-cell lymphoma).
After a median follow-up of four years, there were no significant differences in rates of complete remission, time to treatment failure, disease-free survival, or overall survival in the patients treated with CHOP as compared with those treated with m-BACOD. However, there was more severe and life-threatening pulmonary, infectious, and hematologic toxicity associated with the m-BACOD regimen. In an attempt to measure the importance of dose intensity in the 325 patients who could be analyzed, we retrospectively calculated dose intensity (measured in milligrams per square meter of body-surface area per week) and normalized dose intensity (defined as a percentage of the prescribed dose) for all drugs. The median normalized dose intensity for both cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin was found to be greater in the patients treated with CHOP than in those treated with m-BACOD.
For patients with stage III or IV diffuse mixed or diffuse large-cell lymphoma, CHOP is superior to m-BACOD, but the role of dose intensity is not yet clear.
Effects of allyl chloride on occupationally exposed subjects were studied in two factories manufacturing sodium allyl sulfonate. Twenty-six subjects in factory A and 27 workers in factory B were exposed to allyl chloride at levels of 2.6-6 650 mg/m3 for 2.5 months--6 years and 0.2-25.13 mg/m3 for 1-4.5 years, respectively. Most subjects of factory A had weakness, paresthesia, and numbness in extremities with sensory impairment in the glove-stocking distribution, as well as reduced ankle reflexes. Electroneuromyography showed neurogenic abnormalities in 10 of the 19 subjects examined, the prevalence of neuropathy therefore being 52.6%. Similar symptoms of workers in factory B were clinically much milder, and there were few abnormal neurological signs--yet electromyographic findings indicating mild neuropathy were found in 13 of the 27 subjects. No significant abnormalities of other organs were noted. Possible etiologic factors other than exposure to allyl chloride were excluded. All the evidence obtained indicates that chronic exposure to allyl chloride mainly causes toxic polyneuropathy. The neurotoxicity of allyl chloride has also been confirmed by experimental neuropathological studies.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a very common and heterogeneous childhood-onset psychiatric disorder, affecting between 3% and 5% of school age children worldwide. Although the neurobiology of ADHD is not completely understood, imbalances in both dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems have been implicated in the origin and persistence of core symptoms, which include inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The role of a genetic component in its etiology is strongly supported by genetic studies, and several investigations have suggested that the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1; SLC6A3 locus) may be a small-effect susceptibility gene for ADHD. Stimulant medication has a well-documented efficacy in reducing ADHD symptoms. Methylphenidate, the most prescribed stimulant, seems to act mainly by inhibiting the dopamine transporter protein and dopamine reuptake. In fact, its effect is probably related to an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine, especially in brain regions enriched in this protein (i.e. striatum). It is also important to note that dopamine transporter densities seem to be particularly elevated in the brain of ADHD patients, decreasing after treatment with methylphenidate. Altogether, these observations suggest that the dopamine transporter does play a major role in ADHD. Among the several polymorphisms already described in the SLC6A3 locus, a 40 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism has been extensively investigated in association studies with ADHD. Although there are some negative results, the findings from these reports indicate the allele with ten copies of the 40 bp sequence (10-repeat allele) as the risk allele for ADHD. Some investigations have suggested that this polymorphism can be implicated in dopamine transporter gene expression in vitro and dopamine transporter density in vivo, even though it is located in a non-coding region of the SLC6A3 locus. Despite all these data, few studies have addressed the relationship between genetic markers (specifically the VNTR) at the SLC6A3 locus and response to methylphenidate in ADHD patients. A significant effect of the 40 bp VNTR on response to methylphenidate has been detected in most of these reports. However, the findings are inconsistent regarding both the allele (or genotype) involved and the direction of this influence (better or worse response). Thus, further investigations are required to determine if genetic variation due to the VNTR in the dopamine transporter gene is able to predict different levels of clinical response and palatability to methylphenidate in patients with ADHD, and how this information would be useful in clinical practice.
A very common metastatic site for human breast cancer is bone. The traditional bone metastasis model requires human MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell inoculation into the left heart ventricle of nude mice. MDA-MB-231 cells usually develop osteolytic lesions 3-4 weeks after intracardiac inoculation in these animals. Here, we report a new approach to study the formation of bone metastasis in animals using breast carcinoma cells expressing the bioluminescent jellyfish protein (green fluorescent protein [GFP]). We first established a subclone of MDA-MB-231 cells by repeated in vivo passages in bone using the heart injection model. On stable transfection of this subclone with an expression vector for GFP and subsequent inoculation of GFP-expressing tumor cells (B02/GFP.2) in the mouse tail vein, B02/GFP.2 cells displayed a unique predilection for dissemination to bone. Externally fluorescence imaging of live animals allowed the detection of fluorescent bone metastases approximately 1 week before the occurrence of radiologically distinctive osteolytic lesions. The number, size, and intensity of fluorescent bone metastases increased progressively with time and was indicative of breast cancer cell progression within bone. Histological examination of fluorescent long bones from B02/GFP.2-bearing mice revealed the occurrence of profound bone destruction. Treatment of B02/GFP.2-bearing mice with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid markedly inhibited the progression of established osteolytic lesions and the expansion of breast cancer cells within bone. Overall, this new bone metastasis model of breast cancer combining both fluorescence imaging and radiography should provide an invaluable tool to study the effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents that could suppress cancer colonization in bone.
Neurological side-effects were a limiting factor with older quinolones. Although they appear to be less frequent with the newer fluoroquinolones, we observed nine such cases at Amiens University Hospital over a four-year period. The patients were six women and three men, with a mean age of 61 years. They received a mean dose of 800 mg/day of pefloxacin. Four had septic shock, one left ventricular failure, and seven had signs of cholestasis (signs of liver failure were absent). Neurological manifestations occurred between 24 hours and seven days after starting treatment and disappeared within 24 to 48 hours of stopping the drug or reducing the dosage. They included myoclonia (3 cases), convulsions (2 cases, one with concomitant theophylline), delirium and agitation (2 cases, one in a patient on steroids) and confusion (3 cases). Plasma drug levels were determined in six patients and were above normal peak levels (10 micrograms/ml) in five. Pefloxacin was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid in two cases (8.7 and 15.0 micrograms/ml). Neurological manifestations during pefloxacin treatment are probably related to overdose (plasma levels were above normal in 5/6 cases), possibly being favoured by cholestasis (7/9 cases) and/or hemodynamic factors (5/9). Symptoms can resolve when the pefloxacin dosage is reduced.
Benign intracranial hypertension (BICH) is a rare adverse event. We report the case of a 31-year-old female drug addict who had been seropositive for HIV since 1987. She had stage IV C1 AIDS, and was receiving intravenous amphotericin B for generalized cryptococcosis with no neuromeningeal involvement. She developed BICH that regressed when the antifungal drug was withdrawn and treatment for cerebral edema was started. BICH is a clinical entity involving intracranial hypertension with no focal neurological signs or detectable intracranial lesion. The manifestations include headache, transitory or permanent visual disturbances (diplopia, loss of visual acuity) and the perception of intracranial noise. The cerebrospinal fluid is under increased pressure but the composition is normal. The eye fundus examination shows papillary edema, and the neuroradiological workup is normal. BICH can only be diagnosed once an expansive intracranial process, neuromeningeal infection, and non-communicative hydrocephalus have been ruled out. In the majority of cases, no etiology is found. Such cases of idiopathic BICH usually occur in overweight young women, although drugs can be implicated. Amphotericin B has not previously been held responsible for BICH. On the basis of this observation, we present a review of the literature.
Menkes disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder resulting in seizures, hypotonia, and failure to thrive, is due to inherited loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding a copper-transporting ATPase (Atp7a) on the X chromosome. Although affected patients exhibit signs and symptoms of copper deficiency, the mechanisms resulting in neurologic disease remain unknown. We recently discovered that Atp7a is required for the production of an NMDA receptor-dependent releasable copper pool within hippocampal neurons, a finding that suggests a role for copper in activity-dependent modulation of synaptic activity. In support of this hypothesis, we now demonstrate that copper chelation exacerbates NMDA-mediated excitotoxic cell death in primary hippocampal neurons, whereas the addition of copper is specifically protective and results in a significant decrease in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels after NMDA receptor activation. Consistent with the known neuroprotective effect of NMDA receptor nitrosylation, we show here that this protective effect of copper depends on endogenous nitric oxide production in hippocampal neurons, demonstrating in vivo links among neuroprotection, copper metabolism, and nitrosylation. Atp7a is required for these copper-dependent effects: Hippocampal neurons isolated from newborn Mo(br) mice reveal a marked sensitivity to endogenous glutamate-mediated NMDA receptor-dependent excitotoxicity in vitro, and mild hypoxic/ischemic insult to these mice in vivo results in significantly increased caspase 3 activation and neuronal injury. Taken together, these data reveal a unique connection between copper homeostasis and NMDA receptor activity that is of broad relevance to the processes of synaptic plasticity and excitotoxic cell death.
Since thromboembolic events (TE) are rare among children there is only limited information on the optimal choice of antithrombotic agents, dose and duration of antithrombotic therapy. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is increasingly used for thrombolytic therapy of organ- and limb threatening thrombosis in children. We investigated retrospectively the efficacy and safety of rt-PA in 13 children treated consecutively between 1996-1999, following the same protocol. The median age was 3.9 years (3 days to 16 years). All children suffered from underlying diseases. In addition, 7 children had cardiac catheters and central venous catheters and two children suffered from Factor V Leiden mutation. Seven children presented with a TE in the arterial system, 6 with one in the venous system. All children were treated with continuous infusion of rt-PA (median dose 0.05; 0.0125-0.2 mg/kg/h) together with low-dose standard heparin (median dose 8; 5-15 IU/kg/h). Thrombolysis was performed for a median time period of 102 hours (6 hours to 16 days). Treatment effects on the thrombus were regularly confirmed by ultrasound. Plasma levels of fibrinogen and haemoglobin decreased moderately during treatment. No cumulative effect or increased dose requirement of rt-PA was detected during extended treatment. Patency of obstructed vessels was achieved in all children. One child developed severe gastrointestinal bleeding. Six children (46%) developed minor bleeding at the site of catheter puncture. One child developed rethrombosis at the site of the previous thrombus 2 weeks after completion of rt-PA treatment. Under rigorous laboratory and ultrasound control, our protocol using low dose rt-PA over a prolonged period of time was effective and safe.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is being recognized as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC). Recently, several reports indicated that BPA affects the central nervous system (CNS) during embryonic development. However, the molecular mechanism of BPA in the CNS is not well known. Here, we show that BPA affected Notch signaling by inhibiting the activity of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) cleavage-related enzyme, gamma-secretase (gamma-secretase), at the neurula stage of the Xenopus laevis. BPA caused various morphologic aberrations including scoliosis, eye dysplasia, and loss of pigments in the X. laevis tadpole. These abnormalities were seen whenever BPA was used at the neurula stage. In addition, the expression levels of several marker mRNAs at the neurula stage were investigated by RT-PCR, and we found that the mRNAs expression of ectodermal marker, Pax6, CNS marker, Sox2, and neural crest marker, FoxD3, were decreased by treatment with BPA. These genes contribute to the neural differentiation at the neurula stage, and also the downstream factors of Notch signaling. Injection of NICD but not a Notch ligand, delta 1, rescued the abnormalities caused by BPA. We subsequently assayed the inhibition of the activities of NICD cleavage-related enzymes, tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme, and gamma-secretase, by BPA and found that BPA inhibited the gamma-secretase activity. Furthermore, we expressed presenilin, a main component of gamma-secretase, in Escherichia coli and found the direct binding of BPA with presenilin. These results suggest that BPA affected the neural differentiation by inhibiting gamma-secretase activity, leading to neurodevelopmental abnormalities.
Acute renal failure is a known complication of contrast media (CM) application in risk patients. Therefore an efficient prevention is highly desirable. The purpose of this pilot study was a) to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1 = alprostadil) in the prophylaxis against CM associated renal dysfunction in patients with renal disease, and b) to identify the adequate dose.
A total of 130 patients with renal dysfunction who were scheduled for intravascular CM administration were enrolled. They received PGE1 (10, 20, or 40 ng/kg/min) or placebo intravenously over a period of six hours (beginning one hour prior to exposure). Efficacy was determined by measuring serum creatinine and creatinine clearance. Safety was assessed by recording adverse experiences throughout the study and close monitoring of vital parameters especially during study drug administration.
PGE1 proved to be superior to placebo in all doses. The dose of 20 ng/kg/min was most promising due to the lowest increase of serum creatinine 48 hours after CM administration. With respect to creatinine clearance, no relevant differences between study and control groups were observed.
Our results suggest that intravenously administered PGE1 may be efficient in preventing CM-induced renal dysfunction in patients with renal impairment.
The use of membrane-active antiarrhythmic agents may be complicated by aggravation of existing arrhythmias or development of new drug-induced arrhythmias. Four patients, referred because of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia, were receiving class IC antiarrhythmic agents in an attempt to prevent inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia. New or worsening spontaneous arrhythmias developed while they were on flecainide acetate (n = 3) or encainide hydrochloride (n = 1) therapy. Spontaneous runs of rapid nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia developed in two. Increased frequency of premature ventricular contractions and repetitive forms of ventricular ectopic activity developed in one, despite the fact that inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia had been prevented. Salvos and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia developed in the fourth patient. Propranolol had failed to prevent inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia during previous programmed stimulation studies in three of the four patients, but it reproducibly suppressed drug-induced arrhythmias that appeared only after administration of the IC agents in each patient. Suppression of the proarrhythmic effects by beta-adrenergic blockade suggests a possible interaction of these drugs with autonomic function in the genesis of the observed proarrhythmic effects. Direct pharmacologic control of proarrhythmic drug effects has not previously been reported.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common lymphoma entity. Although a significant amount of DLBCL patients can be cured with modern chemotherapeutic regimens, a substantial proportion of patients die because of progressive disease. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are clearly needed. Inhibitors of mTOR [mammalian target of rapamycin (Rap)] represent a new class of antiproliferative drugs with applications as immunosuppressive and anticancer agents. Extensive safety data exist on the mTOR inhibitor RAD001, which is already approved as an immunosuppressant in organ transplant recipients. Rap and RAD001 inhibited cell cycle progression in DLBCL cells by inducing a G1 arrest without inducing apoptosis. Phosphorylation of the main targets of mTOR, p70 s6 kinase and 4-EBP-1 was reduced in cells cultured in the presence of RAD001. Cell cycle arrest was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB) as well as reduced expression of cyclin D3 and A in all cell lines. Although the effect of the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine (vin) was not enhanced by RAD001, rituximab-induced cytotoxicity was augmented in the rituximab-sensitive cell lines. mTOR inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in DLBCL by inducing a G1 arrest and augments rituximab-induced cytotoxicity. Therefore, combination of these drugs might be an interesting new therapeutic approach in DLBCL patients.
Lisinopril, the lysine analogue of enalaprilat, is a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which is administered once daily by mouth. The efficacy of lisinopril in reducing blood pressure is well established in younger populations, and many trials now show it to be effective in lowering blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension. In comparative and non-comparative clinical trials, 68.2 to 89.1% of elderly patients responded (diastolic pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) to > or = 8 weeks' lisinopril treatment. Age-related differences in antihypertensive efficacy do not appear to be clinically significant, and dosages effective in elderly patients tend to range from 2.5 to 40 mg/day. Dosages usually need to be lower in patients with significant renal impairment. In congestive heart failure, lisinopril 2.5 to 20 mg/day increases exercise duration, improves left ventricular ejection fraction and has no significant effect on ventricular ectopic beats. It is similar in efficacy to enalapril and digoxin and similar or superior to captopril on most end-points. Data from the GISSI-3 post-myocardial infarction trial show that lisinopril reduced mortality and left ventricular dysfunction when given for 42 days starting within 24 hours of the onset of infarction symptoms. Results at 6 weeks and 6 months were similar in elderly and younger patients. Elderly patients, however, among other subgroups, exhibited a strong reduction in risk of low ejection fraction after treatment (-25.5%). Economic studies suggest that lisinopril is cost saving compared with other ACE inhibitors in some markets. When given according to the GISSI-3 protocol, lisinopril appears to be one of the less expensive of the successful ACE inhibitor regimens for acute myocardial infarction. In other trials, patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension improved or did not deteriorate during lisinopril treatment. Blood pressure was controlled and reductions or trends towards reductions in albuminuria were observed. These reductions were similar to those in diltiazem, nifedipine and verapamil recipients, and greater than those in patients receiving atenolol. Lisinopril appears to reduce mortality in diabetic patients after myocardial infarction and may also improve neuropathy associated with diabetes. Lisinopril is well tolerated and the profile of adverse events seen is typical of ACE inhibitors as a class. There is a tendency for more elderly than younger patients to discontinue treatment, but this trend is not clearly related to the incidence of adverse events in these age groups. Drug interactions occur with few other agents and are usually clinically significant only between lisinopril and either diuretics or lithium. Lisinopril is, thus, an effective treatment for elderly patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction and has shown promising benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy.
Low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) even when the total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels are not elevated. The mechanism by which HDL confers protection against atherosclerosis remains speculative. Using high-resolution ultrasound, we measured the dilatation changes of brachial arteries during reactive hyperemia and after sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in 63 patients with established (CHD) and 45 controls, in which the serum TC level was normal. The results showed that both flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and GTN-induced dilatation of brachial arteries in patients with CHD were much reduced compared with control group (2.31+/-2.46% vs. 7.43+/-4.10% and 16.41+/-6.15% vs. 22.44+/-8.63%, respectively, P<0.001 for all). Univariate analysis indicated that FMD of brachial arteries was inversely related to age (r=-0.226, P<0.05), hypertension (r=-0.229, P<0.05), baseline diameter (r=-0.299, P<0.01) and LDL-C (r=-0.237, P<0.05) and positively related to HDL-C (r=0.491, P<0.01). GTN induced vasodilatation was inversely related to age (r=-0.216, P<0. 05) and baseline diameter (-0.476, P<0.01). Multiple stepwise regression analyses in two groups taken together showed that HDL-C and age were the independent predictors of the FMD of brachial arteries (beta=0.466, P=0.000 and beta=-0.184, P=0.020, respectively). Baseline diameter was significant predictor of GTN-induced vasodilatation (beta=-0.390, P=0.000). The analysis in the group of CHD patients showed that only HDL-C was significantly relate to the FMD of brachial arteries (beta=0.295, P=0.018 ) and in controls that hypertension and HDL-C were significantly relate to the FMD of brachial arteries (beta=-0.395, P=0.004 and beta=0.344, P=0.011, respectively). These finding suggest that endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation are impaired in the patients with CHD. HDL exerts a protective effect on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in TC being relatively normal population.
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an environmental contaminant that is considered to be a potent immunotoxicant. In the present study, we examined the effect of 25 micrograms/kg TCDD on cytokine production and T lymphocyte phenotype, cell cycling and receptor activity in female Long-Evans rats that had been injected with 50 micrograms of Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB). In the SEB-injected rats, TCDD increased the serum levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) but did not affect the serum levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The ability of spleen cells and peritoneal cells to produce cytokines in response to SEB restimulation in vitro was also evaluated. TCDD exposure significantly enhanced IL-2 production by spleen cells from SEB-primed rats after 6 h or 24 h in cultures co-stimulated with SEB in vitro. However, TCDD treatment did not alter the production of IL-6 and TNF in these cultures. Although TCDD did not influence the production of IL-6 and TNF in peritoneal cells from SEB-primed rats with SEB restimultion in vitro, IL-1 production was significantly increased at 2 h. Both the kinetics and extent of SEB-induced IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and T-cell receptor (TCR) expression on CD4+ cells was unaffected by TCDD. TCDD did not significantly alter the percentage or the total numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations at various times after SEB injection. However, flow cytometric analysis showed that TCDD exposure increased the percentage of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells cycling in the S and G2M phase. TCDD, in the absence of SEB priming, did not affect any of the immune parameters tested. Nevertheless, collectively these results showed that TCDD can enhance the production of IL-2 and the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ cells cycling in SEB-exposed Long-Evans rats. Histopatholgically, there were not observable effects of SEB on lymphoid organs while thymic atrophy and diffuse hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed in the TCDD-treated animals.
109 (9.8%) of 1103 malaria patients examined in Sabah were deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). 69 of these G6PD-deficient patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatment regimes with chloroquine, chloroquine and primaquine, or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar). No hemolysis was observed in the 1st group; except for a single mild case, no case of hemolysis was seen in the 3rd group. However, in the 2nd group of 23 patients, hemolysis occurred in 7 of 16 patients who had complete G6PD deficiency. Of these 7, 5 required blood transfusion and the other 2 developed acute renal failure, 1 even requiring peritoneal dialysis. In the Fansidar group, 4 of 22 patients took more than 15 days to clear the parasitemia. Chloroquine resistance to falciparum infection was common in the patients given this antimalarial drug.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been recognized as a therapeutic drug for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and chronic viral hepatitis. As one of the mechanisms by which UDCA improves liver function tests in those patients, its immunomodulatory effect is currently considered important. Although the suppressive effects of UDCA on some cytokine productions, T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and immunoglobulin production were observed from in vitro studies, the immunomodulation in vivo by UDCA remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of UDCA administration on the number of immunoglobulin secreting cells in liver, peripheral blood, spleen and Peyer's patches in mice using the enzyme linked immunospot assay and assessed whether the UDCA-mediated immunomodulation is liver-specific. It was demonstrated that intragastric administration of UDCA reduced immunoglobulin secretion by lymphocytes from liver, but not from peripheral blood, spleen, or Peyer's patches. However, immunoglobulin production of those lymphocytes cultured in the presence of UDCA was suppressed, irrespective of their distribution sites, in a UDCA dose-dependent manner. When the concentrations of UDCA in portal and peripheral blood were measured using high performance liquid chromatography, UDCA was detectable in the portal blood in UDCA-treated mice, but not in peripheral blood, suggesting that the concentrations of UDCA in the environment surrounding lymphocytes may be an important factor for the modulation of lymphocyte functions.
Described are the cases of two patients who presented with vocal cord hematomas consequent to poor control of anticoagulation. Both patients presented with hoarseness and cough. One required intubation due to respiratory obstruction. Vocal cord hematomas should be considered in patients who present with upper airway symptoms while anticoagulated.
We report a 75-year-old man with a ten-year history of parkinsonism, who developed acute delirium. He was well until 65 years of age, when there was an onset of tremor in his left hand. He had been treated with levodopa and trihexyphenidyl with marked improvement. He was doing well until July of 1991 at his age of 75-year-old, when he noted backache; he was found to have a compression fracture of the third lumbar spine. He had to use a wheel-chair most of the time since then. In December 1991, he started to have visual hallucinations and difficulty in swallowing. On December 25 of that year, he developed fever and delirium, and was admitted to our hospital on December 30. On admission, general physical examination was unremarkable except for low grade fever (37.3 degrees C). Neurologic examination revealed an alert but chronically ill patient. Apparently he had visual hallucinations. He was disoriented to all spheres; he could respond only to simple questions. Apparently he was demented. Cranial nerves were intact except for mumbling speech disturbance and masked face. He was unable to stand or walk. He had flexion contracture in his both knee joints. He had paratonic rigidity in all his limbs and marked bradykinesia. Once in a while, myoclonic jerks were seen in both upper and lower extremities. Deep reflexes were diminished bilaterally, and the plantar reflex was not elicited on either side. On laboratory examination, BUN was increased to 72 mg/dl, creatinine to 3.0 mg/dl, and WBC 16,000/microliter. Cranial CT scans were unremarkable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Although rare, psychosis can emerge during interferon (IFN)-alpha therapy and persist after therapy is completed.
The authors report the case of a 30-year-old man with hepatitis C infection treated with IFN-alpha and ribavirin who developed acute psychosis with persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations, resulting in a suicide attempt.
The patient was treated with amisulpride for 6 weeks and then with risperidone for 6 weeks.
There was no improvement in symptoms until the patient was treated with quetiapine; he then had a marked recovery from the psychotic symptoms. The duration of the psychosis was 28 weeks.
Hepatitis C can be successfully treated with IFN therapy, and the risk of IFN-induced psychosis is low, with psychotic symptoms resolving in most cases after completion of IFN therapy with or without antipsychotic treatment. In prolonged psychosis induced by IFN, quetiapine might also be of benefit.
Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes and other food products, was purified and shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity in assays representing three major stages of carcinogenesis. Resveratrol was found to act as an antioxidant and antimutagen and to induce phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes (anti-initiation activity); it mediated anti-inflammatory effects and inhibited cyclooxygenase and hydroperoxidase functions (antipromotion activity); and it induced human promyelocytic leukemia cell differentiation (antiprogression activity). In addition, it inhibited the development of preneoplastic lesions in carcinogen-treated mouse mammary glands in culture and inhibited tumorigenesis in a mouse skin cancer model. These data suggest that resveratrol, a common constituent of the human diet, merits investigation as a potential cancer chemopreventive agent in humans.
In utero exposure to environmental carcinogens, including the ubiquitous pollutant benzene, may cause DNA damage in the fetus, leading to an increased risk for the development of childhood cancer. Benzene metabolite-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) may undergo erroneous repair, leading to chromosomal aberrations including chromosomal inversions and translocations. In this study, fetal murine hematopoietic cells from pZK1 transgenic mice were exposed to p-benzoquinone (BQ), a toxic metabolite of benzene, and assessed for DNA recombination, DNA damage including DNA DSBs as measured by γ-H2A.X foci and oxidative DNA damage, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The pZK1 transgenic mouse model contains a DNA construct allowing for the detection of intrachromosomal recombination events. Using this model, a significant increase in recombination was observed following exposure to BQ (25 and 50μM) at various time points. Additionally, increased γ-H2A.X foci were observed following exposure to 25μM BQ for 30 min, 45 min, and 1 h, whereas this exposure did not significantly increase oxidative DNA damage. Pretreatment with 400 U/ml polyethylene glycol-conjugated-catalase attenuated increases in DNA recombination as compared with treatment with BQ alone. An increase in ROS production (30 min and 1 h), as measured by dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescence, was also observed following exposure to 25μM BQ. These studies indicate that BQ is able to induce DNA damage and recombination in fetal liver cells and that ROS may be important in the mechanism of toxicity.
Eye exposure to the organophosphorus (OP) irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor sarin results in long-term miosis and reduction in visual function. Anticholinergic drugs, such as atropine or homatropine, which are used topically in order to counter these effects may produce mydriasis and partial cycloplegia, which may worsen visual performance. This study was aimed to test the efficacy of short-acting anticholinergic drugs against sarin-induced miosis and visual impairment, which will minimally insult vision. Long-Evans rats, exposed topically to various sarin doses from 0 to 10 μg, showed a dose-dependent miosis, which returned to pre-exposure levels within 24-48 h. Tropicamide treatment rapidly widened the miotic effect to a different extent depending on time following treatment and dosage given. Cyclopentolate, however, showed a delayed response that finally widened the pupils in a dose-dependent manner. Atropine treatment showed a rapid widening of the pinpoint pupils exceeding baseline level finally causing mydriasis. Light reflex test showed that the contraction ability of the iris following atropine treatment was impaired, as opposed to the use of tropicamide which facilitated the iris contraction, similar to control. Finally, tropicamide and atropine treatments ameliorated the visual impairment, as opposed to cyclopentolate, which worsened visual performance. Considering that tropicamide treatment against sarin exposure did not cause mydriasis nor did it impair the iris contraction flexibility as a response to light, the use of this drug should be taken into consideration as a first-choice topical treatment against OP intoxication.
