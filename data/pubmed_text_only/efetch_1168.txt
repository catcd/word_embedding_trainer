To provide further evidence that the veratrum alkaloids' mechanical, positive inotropic effect and not their chemical depolarising action predominates in initiating the left ventricular mechanoreceptor (including the Bezold) reflex the effect of intracoronary KCl, a chemical depolarising agent like the veratrum alkaloids, but with a negative inotropic effect, was studied in beating and verapamil-asystolic hearts. Five dogs were placed on a total cardiac bypass, pneumonectomised and their coronary and systemic circulations isolated and perfused separately, at a constant rate, so that changes in systemic pressure reflected changes in systemic resistance. Injection of 5 mmol X litre-1 KCl into the isolated coronary circulation caused cardiac asystole and a resultant reflex rise in systemic pressure (resistance) of 26 +/- 9% (p less than 0.05) above the control of 10.5 +/- 0.7 kPa (79 +/- 5 mmHg). This pressure rise, which indicates predominance of KCl's mechanical, negative inotropic over its chemical depolarising effect, was abolished by vagotomy, indicating its reflex nature. Contrariwise, in five other pneumonectomised dogs, similarly perfused on total cardiac bypass but with cardiac asystole from intracoronary verapamil, a subsequent, similar intracoronary dose of KCl now produced a fall in systemic pressure (resistance) of 8 +/- 2% (p less than 0.005) below the control of 12.8 +/- 0.5 kPa (96 +/- 4 mmHg). This pressure fall, presumably due to chemical depolarisation of the left ventricular mechanoreceptors, was also abolished by vagotomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Hemorrhagic cystitis is a common problem following cyclophosphamide or radiation therapy. Chitosan has been shown to be an effective hemostatic agent and promoter of wound healing in animal experiments. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of intravesical chitosan in an animal model of cyclophosphamide cystitis. Hemorrhagic cystitis was induced in female F344 rats by intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide, 100 mg/kg. Chitosan solution (0.3 ml) was instilled intravesically on day 1 (Group 1), on days 1, 3, and 5 (Group 2), or 1 hour after the administration of cyclophosphamide (Group 3). The rats in group 4 were treated with chitosan diluent on day 1 after cyclophosphamide, and the rats in group 5 received intravesical chitosan without cyclophosphamide. Sequential examination revealed decreased mortality and lower incidences of severe bladder bleeding, necrosis and inflammation in Group 3. Treatment delayed until after the appearance of the cystitis, especially repeated treatments, appeared to make the cyclophosphamide-induced changes worse. Used within 1 hour of cyclophosphamide administration, before the cystitis develops, chitosan seemed to have the possibility to inhibit the appearance of hemorrhagic cystitis. In addition to the changes in the bladder, severe changes occurred in the kidneys secondary to cyclophosphamide.
To understand the relationship between acute recurrent pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction.
An emerging number of patients present with a nonclassic phenotype of cystic fibrosis (CF) with partial features or single-organ disease only. The association between the phenotype of recurrent pancreatitis CFTR dysfunction is unclear.
Patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis were referred for electrophysiologic investigation.
Thirty-three patients (18 males) aged 20+/-12 years with recurrent pancreatitis were studied. Three patients had mild asthma and 1 patient had mild ulcerative colitis. There was no family history of CF. All patients had normal imaging of the pancreatic duct by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. No patient was pancreatic insufficient. Mean sweat chloride values were 41+/-14 meq/L (range: 18 to 64). Nasal potential difference (NPD) measurement was pathologic in 7 patients. Mean basal potential difference in these 7 patients was -33+/-13 mV and there was an abnormal response to chloride-free and isoproterenol solutions. There was no difference in sweat chloride concentration between the 2 groups. Mutation analysis revealed W1282X/5T, D1152H/5T, and W1282X/- in 3 patients with abnormal NPD and 1 W1282X allele was found in 1 patient with normal NPD.
In this series, 21% of patients with recurrent pancreatitis have abnormalities of CFTR function. Patients presenting with recurrent, "idiopathic" pancreatitis require CFTR function testing.
The model of fulminant hepatic failure induced by acetaminophen was established in dogs to observe the changes of hepatic hemodynamics and plasma histamine levels in portal vein (PV), hepatic vein (HV), abdominal aorta (AA) and inferior vena cava (ICV). The results showed that the portal vein resistance (PVR) was elevated and portal venous blood flow (PVF) was decreased; hepatic artery resistance (HAR) was decreased and the hepatic artery blood flow (HAF), portal venous pressure (PVP), wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP) and inferior vena cava pressure (ICVP) had no changes. The histamine of the PV, HV, ICV and AA were all elevated after formation of fulminant hepatic failure. And the increasing wave of the HV was the highest. The increased histamine in HV may be mediated by H1 receptor causing the contraction of hepatic venulae, resulting liver sinusoid congestion, increasing PVR and decreasing PVF which exacerbate the liver cell damage. Moreover, the more severe liver damage, the more histamine was released, and a vicious circle may ensue. Our results also suggest the possibility of using H1 receptor antagonist to treat the disturbance of liver hemodynamics in severe acute liver damage. The increased histamine in systematic circulation as a vasodilator may lower blood pressure and accelerate heart beats. The increase of plasma histamine may play an important role in the changes of hepatic and systemic hemodynamics in fulminant hepatic failure.
Flavopiridol is a novel semisynthetic flavone derivative of the alkaloid rohitukine. Flavopiridol is known to inhibit potently the activity of multiple cyclin-dependent kinases. We have assessed its effects on normal and malignant cells in preclinical animal models of localized and disseminated human hematopoietic neoplasms. Flavopiridol, when administered as daily bolus intravenous (IV) injections, produced selective apoptosis of cells in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, resulting in atrophy of these organs. With the exception of the intestinal crypts, apoptosis or tissue damage was absent in all other organs investigated (kidneys, liver, lungs, bone/bone marrow, muscle, and heart). Flavopiridol had a marked apoptotic effect documented by DNA nick-end labeling, or DNA agarose gels in xenografts of human hematopoietic tumors HL-60, SUDHL-4, and Nalm/6. After treatment with 7.5 mg/kg flavopiridol bolus IV or intraperitoneal on each of 5 consecutive days, 11 out of 12 advanced stage subcutaneous (s.c.) human HL-60 xenografts underwent complete regressions, and animals remained disease-free several months after one course of flavopiridol treatment. SUDHL-4 s.c. lymphomas treated with flavopiridol at 7.5 mg/kg bolus IV for 5 days underwent either major (two out of eight mice) or complete (four out of eight mice) regression, with two animals remaining disease-free for more than 60 days. The overall growth delay was 73.2%. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated lymphoma AS283 showed no significant response when flavopiridol was used in advanced s.c. tumors, but when treatment was initiated in early stages, there was a complete regression of the early tumors, and a significant overall growth delay (>84%). When flavopiridol was used in severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing disseminated human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Nalm/6 cells, there was 15-day prolongation in survival (P = .0089). We conclude that flavopiridol greatly influences apoptosis in both normal and malignant hematopoietic tissues. This activity was manifested in our study as a potent antileukemia or antilymphoma effect in human tumor xenografts, which was dose and schedule dependent. These findings provide compelling evidence for the use of flavopiridol in human hematologic malignancies.
We report the effect on complex I function of the 14484 Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) mutation affecting the ND6 subunit gene. The same gene was also reported to carry another mutation, at position 14459, associated with the LHON/dystonia phenotype that induces a reduction of complex I-specific activity and increases the sensitivity to the product decylubiquinol. Given the proximity of both mutations in the ND6 gene, we tested the specific activity of complex I and its sensitivity to myxothiazol and nonylbenzoquinol, both inhibitors at the ubiquinol product site, in platelet submitochondrial particles from nine 14484 homoplasmic individuals, 8 Italians with Caucasian mtDNA haplogroup J (adjunctive 4216 and 13708 mutations), and 1 Tunisian with an African mtDNA haplogroup. The specific activity of complex I was not affected by the 14484 mutation, but the sensitivity to both inhibitors was significantly increased compared with control subjects regardless of the presence of haplogroup J polymorphisms. Analysis of 70 different amino acid sequences of the ND6 subunit indicated that the 14484 mutation affects an amino acid belonging to its most conserved region, which shows local similarities with cytochrome b regions interacting with ubiquinone or ubiquinol in complex III. Our results suggest that both 14484 and 14459 mutations may affect amino acids forming the interaction site of ubiquinol product, and the 14484 mutation produces a biochemical defect resembling in part that already reported for the common 11778/ND4 LHON mutation.
Pooled serum from women taking a combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive preparation caused significantly greater cell proliferation and incorporation of 3H-thymidine into DNA in both human arterial smooth muscle cells and dermal fibroblasts in tissue culture than did serum from controls. A portion of this mitogenic effect appears to be related to the presence of a factor(s) that is heat stable, nondialyzable, and contained in the lipoprotein-deficient serum fraction. In vitro addition of varying concentrations of mestranol and norethindrone, the two constituents of the oral contraceptive preparation taken by participants in the study, to control serum did not enhance its mitogenicity, suggesting that the effect observed with intact serum was due either to a metabolite of these compounds or to the production of other growth-promoting substances during oral contraceptive treatment. Since smooth muscle cell proliferation is an integral feature of all atherosclerotic lesions, these findings provide some insights applicable to understanding the pathogenesis of vascular disease associated with oral contraceptive use.
Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEI) each act in a different manner to prevent myocardial fibrosis and left ventricular (LV) stiffness in animals with pathways in the heart for generating ANG II as well as ACE. A model of pacing-induced congestive heart failure (CHF) was used to test the central hypothesis that ARB + ACEI prevents myocardial fibrosis and decreases LV stiffness to a greater extent than ARB or ACEI alone. Thirty-five dogs were assigned to the following treatment protocols on the 8th day of a 4-wk pacing schedule: 1) rapid ventricular pacing, 2) ARB (candesartan cilexetil, 1.5 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) with pacing, 3) ACEI (enalapril, 1.9 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) with pacing, 4) ARB (candesartan cilexetil, 0.75 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) + ACEI (enalapril, 0.95 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) with pacing, and 5) sham operation. The LV stiffness coefficient was significantly increased after rapid pacing but was significantly lower with ARB + ACEI than with ARB or ACEI alone. The collagen volume fraction and mRNA levels of collagen I and III, which were increased by rapid pacing, were significantly lower with ARB + ACEI than with ARB or ACEI alone. Thus ARB + ACEI prevents myocardial fibrosis and decreases LV stiffness during the progression of CHF compared with ARB or ACEI alone.
The aim of this paper was to investigate whether rotenone, a pesticide causing experimental parkinsonism, causes direct damage to dopaminergic structure when injected intracerebrally and whether this action may be prevented by peripheral administration of 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1MeTIQ), an endogenous compound with anti-dopaminergic activity. Male Wistar rats were injected unilaterally into the median forebrain bundle with 2 microg rotenone, and received 1MeTIQ, 50 mg/kg i.p. 1 h before and then daily for 21 d. To compare the effect of intracerebral and peripheral treatment, rotenone was also given once or for 7 d in a dose of 10 mg/kg s.c. Dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites were assessed by HPLC in the substantia nigra and striatum. While a single subcutaneous rotenone dose did not produce any change in striatal dopamine metabolism, the multiple treatments resulted in changes suggesting a shift in the metabolism towards oxidative desamination and reduction of O-methylation. In contrast to systemic injections, intracerebral-administered rotenone produced a decrease in dopamine and its metabolites content in the striatum (dopamine decrease by 70%) and substantia nigra (dopamine decrease by 35%), without affecting the serotonin system. As those changes were observed 21 d after the injection of rotenone, they suggest a durable neurotoxic effect. The treatment with 1MeTIQ strongly reduced the fall of striatal dopamine concentration. The data suggest that rotenone given peripherally affects metabolic processes in dopaminergic neurons, and this seems to result from its neurotoxic action, which may be observed after an intracerebral injection. 1MeTIQ is able to counteract the damaging action of rotenone and seems to be a potential neuroprotective agent.
A solution of methiodal sodium (20%) and lidocaine HCl (0.20%) was given by intramedullary injection into the lumbar spinal cords of 12 anesthetized dogs (group I). Two control groups of 12 dogs each were subjected to needle placement only or were given 5% dextrose. The results showed that both solutions given by intramedullary injection caused severe spinal cord malacia and cavitation in 2 group I dogs and in 1 group III dog.
Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent increasingly used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in pediatric patients. Few published data exist concerning quetiapine's effects in therapeutic settings or short-term overdose in pediatric and adolescent populations. In this report, we describe a 15-year-old adolescent girl who experienced continued delirium 5 days after an overdose of quetiapine, trazodone, and clonidine. The patient initially presented with sedation and stable vital signs. After 3 days of gradual improvement, she experienced episodes of delirium coinciding with an increase in resting heart rate. On the basis of suspicion for quetiapine-associated antimuscarinic effects, the patient was administered intravenously with physostigmine on the fifth day after ingestion. Treatment resulted in a brief resolution of symptoms. Serum quetiapine levels measured 1 day and 5 days after ingestion were 3400 and 4800 ng/mL, respectively. The use of physostigmine and interpretation of serum levels are discussed further.
Macrolides are known to have relatively few side effects and are prescribed in cases of allergic reaction to penicillin. The new macrolides, for example Azithromycin and Roxithromycin, are increasingly preferred over erythromycin at the ear, nose, and throat out-patient department due to improved oral reabsorption (acid resistance), better penetration into tissue, prolonged half-life, extended antibacterial activity, modest side effects, and better pharmacokinetics. There are only few case reports concerning side effects of macrolides. We report on the appearance of a Churg Strauss-Syndrome (CSS) in a patient following intake of the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin and roxithromycin.
A 50-year-old patient with asthma for three years presented with arthritis and mononeuritis multiplex. Laboratory and radiological investigations revealed eosinophilia (64%), eosinophilic infiltrations of bone marrow, raised IgE-level, and transient pulmonary infiltrates. THERAPY AND DEVELOPMENT: Intravenous steroid therapy was started and resulted in normalization of eosinophilia, IgE-level, and asthmatic symptoms. The neurologic deficits showed only a weak tendency for improvement.
The diagnosis of CSS was established on the basis of clinical criterias and laboratory investigations. The diagnosis was supported by the fact that a similar course of the disease was observed one year ago following administration of azithromycin, another macrolide.
We studied 17 hypertensive men to determine the relationship of diuretic-induced hypokalemia to ventricular ectopic activity ( VEA ). Blood values and 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring were done at baseline, after diuretic and after serum potassium normalization. Two subgroups of patients were identified: group A patients were older (63.0 vs. 53.8 years) and had clinical evidence of organic heart disease compared to group B. Group A had increased frequency and complexity of VEA with diuretic which reverted to baseline after potassium normalization. Group B had no changes. Serum and intra-red blood cell potassium decrements were equal in both groups. We conclude that clinical in addition to laboratory observation should be used to identify those hypertensive patients most susceptible to diuretic-induced VEA and their serum potassium level should be normalized in order to minimize this complication.
Gene expression of heparanase, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were examined in ventricles after chronic treatment with isoproterenol (ISO) induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats. Rats were treated with ISO (4 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) twice daily for 4 d. Ventricle weight of the heart and the ventricle weight/body weight ratio were increased respectively by 22% and 25% compared with control rats. Histology showed considerable cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in the ISO-treated rats in comparison to control rats. Northern blot hybridization revealed that heparanase and MMP-2 gene transcripts increased significantly in the ventricles of ISO-treated rats, whereas MMP-9 gene expression was not induced. Thus, heparanase and MMP-2 gene expressions are induced in the ventricle after chronic treatment with ISO, indicating that they might play an important role in development of ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
The role of nitric oxide (NO) in acute lung injury remains controversial. Although inhaled NO increases oxygenation in clinical trials, inhibiting NO-synthase (NOS) can be protective. To examine the latter, nickel-exposed mice were treated with saline or NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Initial microarray analysis of nickel-induced gene expression of saline-treated mice revealed increased inflammatory mediator, matrix injury-repair, and hypoxia-induced factor-mediated sequences and decreased lung-specific (e.g., surfactant-associated protein B and C) sequences. Compared with saline control, L-NAME-treated mice had enhanced survival with attenuated serum nitrate/nitrite, endothelial NOS activity, and lavage neutrophils and protein. Although initial cytokine (i.e., interferon-gamma, interleukins-1beta and -6, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) gene expression was similar between groups, subsequent larger cytokine increases only occurred in saline-treated mice. Similarly, surfactant protein gene expression decreased initially in both groups yet was restored subsequently with L-NAME treatment. Interestingly, the role of inducible NOS (iNOS) in these responses seems minimal. iNOS gene expression was unaltered, iNOS activity and nitrotyrosine residues were undetectable, and an iNOS antagonist, aminoguanidine, failed to increase survival. Rather, systemic L-NAME treatment appears to attenuate pulmonary endothelial NOS activity, subsequent cytokine expression, inflammation, and protein permeability, and thereby restores surfactant gene expression and increases survival.
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is an important cause of hepatocellular injury. Hepatic necrosis may range from asymptomatic elevations in transaminases to fulminant hepatic failure and death. A 50-year-old Asian man developed moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases after commencing labetalol therapy for a hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. Extensive evaluation revealed evidence of chronic hepatitis B infection, of which the patient was previously not aware. Hepatic transaminases normalized after discontinuation of labetalol.
46 patients treated with lithium for an average of 8 years participated in a functional-morphological follow-up study based on a 12-day hospitalization and involving a kidney biopsy. The functional part of the study showed that tubular function was markedly influenced, leading to increased urine volume (average 3 1/24 h) and a decreased renal concentration capacity in 85% of the patients. Glomerular function was generally not influenced, and only 10% of the patients had glomerular filtration rates below their age-corrected normal ranges. Both urine volume and glomerular filtration rates showed significant correlations with dosage schedule. Urine volume was lower and glomerular filtration rate higher on a one-dose schedule than when lithium was given in divided doses during the day. It is concluded that discontinuity in lithium treatment minimizes lithium effects on kidney function.
We have previously shown that the rat with experimental diabetes (DM) of 4-6 months' duration exhibits complete functional and morphologic protection against gentamicin-induced acute renal failure. To assess the role of the duration of the diabetic state per se on the resistance to gentamicin, female Sprague-Dawley rats with diabetes of short (5 days, n = 7), intermediate (5 weeks, n = 5) and long duration (5 months, n = 7) were studied. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin, 50-65 mg/kg b.w. i.v. Controls were identically treated sex- and age matched nondiabetic rats. The animals were kept in individual metabolic cages for 2 weeks and all received gentamicin 40 mg/kg/day for 9 days. Sham animals (DM and control) received Ringer's solution in place of gentamicin. Prior to gentamicin, plasma glucose levels and creatinine clearances (Ccr) were higher in the DM long duration group (619 +/- 25 (SE) mg/dl; 2.6 +/- 0.2 ml/min, respectively) than in the DM short (514 +/- 24; 2.0 +/- 0.1) and DM intermediate duration (442 +/- 30; 2.1 +/- 0.1) groups, while urine volume and glycosuria were similar. Following gentamicin the three control groups developed acute renal failure (maximal decrease in Ccr of 60 +/- 7, 72 +/- 9 and 71 +/- 7%, respectively; p less than 0.01 to less than 0.001), lysozymuria and acute tubular necrosis. There were no significant differences in the degree of renal impairment observed among the three control groups. In marked contrast, in the three DM groups these changes were absent and the renal cortical gentamicin content was lower than that of the control groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Previous research has implicated limbic and prefrontal cortical areas in the control of drug-seeking behavior. The present study examined the effects of orbitofrontal-cortex (OFC) lesions on acquisition, dose-dependence, within-session patterning, and reinstatement of cocaine self-administration. Rats received OFC or sham lesions before or after acquisition (0.3 mg/kg/injection, paired with a visual stimulus), then were tested with a range of doses (0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1). Compared to controls, rats lesioned before acquisition acquired the behavior sooner, responded more at low doses, and responded more on the first day of extinction. Rats that were lesioned after acquisition showed an even larger increase in responding (approximately 250%) at the lowest dose, and they also showed increased timeout responding and drug "loading" at low doses. Pre-acquisition lesions were tested and found to have no effect on cocaine-induced reinstatement. In parallel experiments examining effects of pre-acquisition OFC lesions on food-reinforced responding, lesions did not alter acquisition, maintenance, or reinstatement, but accelerated the course of extinction. The increased cocaine self-administration seen in OFC-lesioned rats did not resemble the dysregulated drug intake observed in long-access models of addiction but might be due to impaired response inhibition or impaired tracking of the reward value of drug-related cues.
The association of lower leg ulcer development and hydroxyurea therapy in patients with myeloproliferative disorders has been reported previously. In most of these cases the ulcers healed with cessation of the hydroxyurea together with meticulous attention to wound care. We report a patient who developed painful vasculitic ulcers secondary to hydroxyurea on both lower legs whilst on long-term hydroxyurea therapy for idiopathic thrombocytosis. The ulcers extended relentlessly despite stopping hydroxyurea, maximizing topical therapies and starting intensive systemic treatment. We discuss the association of hydroxyurea therapy with the development of painful ulceration.
Overt nephrotic syndrome developed in a young housewife treated with lithium carbonate from manic-depressive psychosis. Complete spontaneous remission was observed 1 month after discontinuing the drug but the nephrotic state reappeared 8 years later when lithium therapy was re-instituted. The renal biopsy showed minimal glomerular lesions without interstitial disease.
L-Dopa therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is counfounded by the development of involuntary movements such as L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs). In this study GABA(A) receptor autoradiography was assessed using [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor and [(35)S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding to the chloride channel of GABA(A) receptors in the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). L-Dopa-treated parkinsonian monkeys experiencing LIDs were compared to animals in which LIDs was prevented by adjunct treatments with CI-1041, a selective antagonist of the NR1A/2B subtype of NMDA receptor, or low doses of the dopamine D2 receptor agonist, cabergoline. Our results demonstrated a decrease of GABA(A) receptor specific binding in the posterior part of the SNr in dyskinetic monkeys compared to nondyskinetic animals, while no modulation has been observed in the STN. These results provide evidence for the first time that pharmacological treatments preventing LIDs in nonhuman primate model of PD are associated with normalization of GABA(A) receptor-mediated signalling in the SNr.
Studies in abstinent methamphetamine (METH) users have demonstrated reductions in brain dopamine transporter (DAT) binding potential (BP), as well as cognitive and motor deficits, but it is not yet clear whether cognitive deficits and brain DAT reductions fully reverse with sustained abstinence, or whether behavioral deficits in METH users are related to dopamine (DA) deficits. This study was conducted to further investigate potential persistent psychomotor deficits secondary to METH abuse, and their relationship to brain DAT availability, as measured using quantitative PET methods with [(11)C]WIN 35428.
Twenty-two abstinent METH users and 17 healthy non-METH using controls underwent psychometric testing to test the hypothesis that METH users would demonstrate selective deficits in neuropsychiatric domains known to involve DA neurons (e.g., working memory, executive function, motor function). A subset of subjects also underwent PET scanning with [(11)C]WIN 35428.
METH users were found to have modest deficits in short-term memory, executive function, and manual dexterity. Exploratory correlational analyses revealed that deficits in memory, but not those in executive or motor function, were associated with decreases in striatal DAT BP.
These results suggest a possible relationship between DAT BP and memory deficits in abstinent METH users, and lend support to the notion that METH produces lasting effects on central DA neurons in humans. As METH can also produce toxic effects on serotonin (5-HT) neurons, further study is needed to address the potential role of brain 5-HT depletion in cognitive deficits in abstinent METH users.
A structured psychiatric interview was used to examine the symptom history of 55 patients meeting DSM-III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks and five patients meeting DSM-III criteria for panic disorder. Anticipatory anxiety and generalized anxiety occurred in over 80% of the patients, and these anxiety states together with panic attacks and phobic avoidances had courses that were chronic and unremitting. Major depression occurred in 70% of the patients and had an episodic course that differentiated it from the anxiety states. Other frequently reported disorders were childhood separation disorder (18%), alcoholism (17%), and obsessive compulsive disorder (17%). An initial nonspontaneous first panic attack and separation anxiety was associated with earlier onset and longer duration of agoraphobia and panic disorder. An inaccurate cognitive appraisal of the initial panic attack frequently led to the rapid development of subsequent agoraphobia. Caffeine consumption exacerbated anxiety in 54% of the patients and triggered panic attacks in 17%. Fifty-one percent of female agoraphobics experienced premenstrual exacerbation of anxiety symptoms.
