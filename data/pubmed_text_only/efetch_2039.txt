The wide use of lamivudine in chronic hepatitis B has produced a monotonic increase in patients with lamivudine resistance. Therefore, treating lamivudine resistance in chronic hepatitis B is a major concern in clinical practice for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV). There is conflicting evidence on the outcome of pegylated interferon alpha (PEG-IFN alpha) therapy against lamivudine-resistant HBV, which is due to mutations in the YMDD motif. We experienced a patient with chronic hepatitis B who was successfully treated with PEG-IFN alpha-2a after the development of virologic and biochemical breakthrough during lamivudine therapy. Virologic breakthrough was associated with the emergence of YMDD mutants 48 months after starting lamivudine therapy. Treatment with PEG-IFN alpha-2a for 12 months resulted in an undetectable serum level of HBV DNA and the resolution of hepatitis, and the virologic response was maintained over 16 months after cessation of PEG-IFN alpha-2a.
Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) is a nucleotide analogue that inhibits wild-type hepatitis B virus (HBV) and lamivudine (LMV)-resistant HBV mutants. The aim of this study was to elucidate the efficacy of ADV monotherapy and the incidence of genotypic resistance to ADV in patients with LMV-resistant chronic HBV infection.
This study involved 124 patients with chronic HBV infection who had received ADV monotherapy due to the presence of LMV-resistant HBV mutants. The efficacy of ADV was evaluated by the normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level and by the reduction of serum HBV DNA level (with cutoff levels of 2x10(4) IU/mL and 2x10(2) IU/mL). The cumulative rate of HBeAg loss or seroconversion was assessed in HBeAg-positive patients. The development of mutations in the reverse trancriptase region of HBV DNA polymerase was evaluated by direct sequencing analysis during ADV monotherapy.
The mean serum HBV DNA level was 5.94 log10IU/mL. At 12 and 24 months after ADV monotherapy, the cumulative rates of serum ALT normalization were 69.4% and 75.5%, respectively, and those of serum HBV DNA reduction were 79.8% and 89.2% for a cutoff level of 2x10(4) IU/mL, and 44.2% and 59.0% for a cutoff of 2x10(2) IU/mL. The mean serum HBV DNA levels at 12 and 24 months were significantly lower than baseline, at 3.24 and 3.04 log10IU/mL, respectively (P<0.001). At 12 months after ADV treatment, the cumulative rates of HBeAg loss and seroconversion were 15.8% and 10.5%, respectively, and the rtN236T and rtA181T/V mutants in HBV DNA polymerase were identified in 25% and 64% of patients, respectively.
Although ADV monotherapy is effective, it leads to a high rate of mutations of HBV DNA reverse transcriptase gene in patients with chronic HBV infections who have LMV-resistant HBV mutants.
A genome-wide association screen for primary biliary cirrhosis risk alleles was performed in an Italian cohort. The results from the Italian cohort replicated IL12A and IL12RB associations, and a combined meta-analysis using a Canadian dataset identified newly associated loci at SPIB (P = 7.9 x 10(-11), odds ratio (OR) = 1.46), IRF5-TNPO3 (P = 2.8 x 10(-10), OR = 1.63) and 17q12-21 (P = 1.7 x 10(-10), OR = 1.38).
The herbal formulation, AVM is a proprietary formula that consists of extracts of herbs that have been used in Indian traditional medicine to promote physical and mental health, improve defense mechanisms of the body and enhance longevity. AVM (500 and 1000 mg/kg) was tested for its adaptogenic activity by determining antistress, anabolic and immunomodulatory effects. In antistress activity, pretreatment with AVM significantly attenuated the changes in ascorbic acid (from blood and adrenal), cortisol (from plasma and adrenal) and adrenal gland weights induced due to restrain stress (physical immobilization). Its antistress effect at 1000 mg/kg was comparable to that of diazepam (5 mg/kg) treated group. Leucopenia, and anemia induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP) was shown to reduce significantly by AVM. Treatment of AVM + CYP had increased spleen and thymus weights significantly as compared to CYP alone treated group. The anabolic activity was evaluated by weight gain of the levator ani muscle, ventral prostrate gland and seminal vesicles in rats as compared to untreated control.
Trimazosin is a quinazoline antihypertensive agent structurally related to the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin. Trimazosin has been shown previously to have less affinity for alpha 1-adrenoceptors than prazosin. In the present study we compared the hypotensive potency and efficacy of the two agents, and their effects on pressor responses to phenylephrine in anesthetized dogs. We also determined the effect of trimazosin administered during a maximum hypotensive response to prazosin, and of sodium nitroprusside administered after trimazosin or prazosin. Compared with prazosin, trimazosin was a less potent but more efficacious hypotensive agent. At doses which caused equal or even greater hypotensive effects than those caused by prazosin, trimazosin caused less inhibition of pressor responses to phenylephrine. When administered during a maximum hypotensive response to prazosin, trimazosin caused an additional fall in pressure. These results clearly demonstrate an additional action of trimazosin beyond blockade of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Both trimazosin and prazosin augmented the hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside, but only trimazosin enhanced its relaxant effect on isolated rat aorta. Thus we conclude that in addition to alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade, another mechanism contributes to the hypotensive effect of trimazosin, and we speculate that elevation of cyclic GMP levels in vascular smooth muscle may be related to this additional mechanism.
A full consensus has not been reached about the hemodynamic efficacy of hydrocortisone administration in hypotensive and vasopressor-dependent preterm neonates.
To examine the efficacy of hydrocortisone for treatment of hypotension and reduction of vasopressor requirements in preterm infants.
Standard meta-analytic techniques, including random and fixed effects models, were used to calculate combined effect size correlations and significance levels.
Random effects meta-analysis showed that hydrocortisone increases blood pressure (seven studies; N=144; r=0.71, 95%CI=0.18 to 0.92) and reduces vasopressor requirement (five studies; N=93; r=0.74, 95%CI=0.0084 to 0.96). The number of new or unretrieved studies averaging null results required to increase the overall p to 0.05 is k=78 for blood pressure increase and k=47 for vasopressor requirement reduction.
The effects of hydrocortisone on increasing blood pressure and decreasing vasopressor requirements in preterm infants are robust with a large tolerance for future null results. Actual clinical benefits of increasing blood pressure and decreasing vasopressor requirements, however, remain unknown. Long-term sequelae of hydrocortisone administration have yet to be fully elucidated.
In rhesus monkeys, intravenous challenge with 0.6 x 10(10) to 2.2 x 10(10)Pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms caused acute illness of 4 to 5 days' duration with spontaneous recovery in 13 of 15 monkeys; blood cultures became negative 3 to 17 days after challenge. Leukocytosis was observed in all monkeys. Intravenous or intratracheal inoculation of 2.0 to 2.5 mg of vincristine sulfate was followed by leukopenia in 4 to 5 days. Intravenous inoculation of 4.2 x 10(10) to 7.8 x 10(10) pyocin type 6 Pseudomonas organisms in monkeys given vincristine sulfate 4 days previously resulted in fatal infection in 11 of 14 monkeys, whereas none of four receiving Pseudomonas alone died. These studies suggest that an antimetabolite-induced leukopenia predisposes to severe Pseudomonas sepsis and that such monkeys may serve as a biological model for study of comparative efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
The sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent tolazamide is thought to be a rare cause of jaundice and to exhibit no hepatic cross-sensitivity with other sulfonylurea compounds. We have described a patient who had self-limited cholestatic jaundice after treatment with chlorpropamide. Subsequent treatment with tolazamide resulted in recurrence of jaundice, which disappeared after cessation of treatment. Tolazamide may exhibit hepatic cross-sensitivity with chlorpropamide.
Antiarrhythmic effects of aprindine were examined using three canine ventricular arrhythmia models (induced by digitalis, adrenaline, and two-stage coronary ligation), and the minimum effective plasma concentration of aprindine was determined for each arrhythmia model. Aprindine suppressed all three arrhythmias, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by digitalis, adrenaline, and 24-h and 48-h coronary ligation were 0.8 +/- 0.4, 1.0 +/- 0.4, 1.6 +/- 0.3, and 3.1 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6-7). The minimum effective plasma concentrations of aprindine for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias were significantly lower than those for coronary ligation-induced arrhythmias. Oral aprindine was also effective in suppressing both the 24- and 48-h coronary ligation-induced arrhythmias. Aprindine had a hypotensive effect when it was given intravenously, but this effect was not observed when it was given orally. The correlations between the aprindine plasma concentrations and the antiarrhythmic effects were not very strong and indicated individual variations in sensitivity to aprindine.
Dioxins are known to cause several human cancers through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Harmaline and harmalol are dihydro-Î²-carboline compounds present in several medicinal plants such as Peganum harmala. We have previously demonstrated the ability of P. harmala extract to inhibit TCDD-mediated induction of Cyp1a1 in murine hepatoma Hepa 1c1c7 cells. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the effect of harmaline and its main metabolite, harmalol, on dioxin-mediated induction of CYP1A1 in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Our results showed that harmaline and harmalol at concentrations of (0.5-12.5Î¼M) significantly inhibited the dioxin-induced CYP1A1 at mRNA, protein and activity levels in a concentration-dependent manner. The role of AhR was determined by the inhibition of the TCDD-mediated induction of AhR-dependent luciferase activity and the AhR/ARNT/XRE formation by both harmaline and harmalol. In addition, harmaline significantly displaced [(3)H]TCDD in the competitive ligand binding assay. At posttranslational level, both harmaline and harmalol decreased the protein stability of CYP1A1, suggesting that posttranslational modifications are involved. Moreover, the posttranslational modifications of harmaline and harmalol involve ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway and direct inhibitory effects of both compounds on CYP1A1 enzyme. These data suggest that harmaline and harmalol are promising agents for preventing dioxin-mediated effects.
A patient with a deficient voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is reported, presenting clinically with psychomotor retardation and minor dysmorphic features. Biochemical studies on muscle mitochondria showed impaired rates of pyruvate oxidation and ATP production; however, no specific deficient activity of one of the mitochondrial enzymes was involved. Western blotting experiments indicated an almost complete VDAC deficiency in skeletal muscle. The only moderately decreased VDAC content in the patient's fibroblasts might indicate that VDAC is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The deficiency is likely caused by a mutation in the HVDAC1 gene or by a distributed posttranslational modification. This is the first described deficiency of a component of the outer mitochondrial membrane associated with the pyruvate oxidation pathway. Defects in this membrane should be considered as a possible cause of otherwise unexplained mitochondrial disorders.
Methylphenidate has been shown elsewhere to improve hyperactivity in about half of treated children who have pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) and significant hyperactive-inattentive symptoms. We present secondary analyses to better define the scope of effects of methylphenidate on symptoms that define attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), as well as the core autistic symptom domain of repetitive behavior.
Sixty-six children (mean age 7.5 y) with autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and PDD not otherwise specified, were randomized to varying sequences of placebo and three different doses of methylphenidate during a 4-week blinded, crossover study. Methylphenidate doses used approximated .125, .25, and .5 mg/kg per dose, twice daily, with an additional half-dose in the late afternoon. Outcome measures included the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Questionnaire revised for DSM-IV (ADHD and ODD scales) and the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales for PDD.
Methylphenidate was associated with significant improvement that was most evident at the .25- and .5-mg/kg doses. Hyperactivity and impulsivity improved more than inattention. There were not significant effects on ODD or stereotyped and repetitive behavior.
Convergent evidence from different assessments and raters confirms methylphenidate's efficacy in relieving ADHD symptoms in some children with PDD. Optimal dose analyses suggested significant interindividual variability in dose response.
Milk-alkali syndrome was first described 70 years ago in the context of the treatment of peptic ulcer disease with large amounts of calcium and alkali. Although with current ulcer therapy (H-2 blockers, omeprazole, and sucralfate), the frequency of milk-alkali syndrome has decreased significantly, the classic triad of hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal impairment remains the hallmark of the syndrome. Milk-alkali syndrome can present serious and occasionally life-threatening illness unless diagnosed and treated appropriately. This article presents a patient with hypoparathyroidism who was treated with calcium carbonate and calcitriol resulting in two admissions to the hospital for milk-alkali syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous pamidronate on his first admission and with hydrocortisone on the second. This illustrates intravenous pamidronate as a valuable therapeutic tool when milk-alkali syndrome presents as hypercalcemic emergency.
We report the case of perineal aggressive angiomyxoma in a 46-year-old woman presenting as left perineal swelling associated with superficial dyspareunia. Initial clinical examination revealed a 4- to 5-cm cystic mass in the posterior aspect of the left labia majora, not thought to be typical of a Bartholin cyst. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a well-defined 2- x 1.5- x 2-cm area posterolateral to the lower vagina on the left but anterolateral to the anal canal extending into the left ischiorectal fossa, with no obvious involvement of the anal sphincter complex. Excision biopsy was performed via an incision in the left labia majus under general anesthesia. Histologic findings were consistent with aggressive angiomyxoma of the vulva. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing spindle cells positive for vimentin with strong nuclear staining for estrogen and progestogen receptors. Postoperative management following discussion at the multidisciplinary gynecological oncology meeting was to perform a repeat MRI scan 6 weeks postoperatively, and treatment with raloxifene was commenced for its antiestrogenic property.
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity, although common, has been reported only infrequently with sulfonylureas. For glyburide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, only two brief reports of hepatotoxicity exist. Two patients with type II diabetes mellitus developed an acute hepatitis-like syndrome soon after initiation of glyburide therapy. There was no serologic evidence of viral infection, and a liver biopsy sample showed a histologic pattern consistent with drug-induced hepatitis. Both patients recovered quickly after stopping glyburide therapy and have remained well for a follow-up period of 1 year. Glyburide can produce an acute hepatitis-like illness in some persons.
Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous disease with diverse molecular and histological subtypes. We performed whole-genome sequencing in 100 tumor-normal pairs, along with DNA copy number, gene expression and methylation profiling, for integrative genomic analysis. We found subtype-specific genetic and epigenetic perturbations and unique mutational signatures. We identified previously known (TP53, ARID1A and CDH1) and new (MUC6, CTNNA2, GLI3, RNF43 and others) significantly mutated driver genes. Specifically, we found RHOA mutations in 14.3% of diffuse-type tumors but not in intestinal-type tumors (P < 0.001). The mutations clustered in recurrent hotspots affecting functional domains and caused defective RHOA signaling, promoting escape from anoikis in organoid cultures. The top perturbed pathways in gastric cancer included adherens junction and focal adhesion, in which RHOA and other mutated genes we identified participate as key players. These findings illustrate a multidimensional and comprehensive genomic landscape that highlights the molecular complexity of gastric cancer and provides a road map to facilitate genome-guided personalized therapy.
Diffuse-type gastric carcinoma (DGC) is characterized by a highly malignant phenotype with prominent infiltration and stromal induction. We performed whole-exome sequencing on 30 DGC cases and found recurrent RHOA nonsynonymous mutations. With validation sequencing of an additional 57 cases, RHOA mutation was observed in 25.3% (22/87) of DGCs, with mutational hotspots affecting the Tyr42, Arg5 and Gly17 residues in RHOA protein. These positions are highly conserved among RHO family members, and Tyr42 and Arg5 are located outside the guanine nucleotide-binding pocket. Several lines of functional evidence indicated that mutant RHOA works in a gain-of-function manner. Comparison of mutational profiles for the major gastric cancer subtypes showed that RHOA mutations occur specifically in DGCs, the majority of which were histopathologically characterized by the presence of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas together with more differentiated components in the gastric mucosa. Our findings identify a potential therapeutic target for this poor-prognosis subtype of gastric cancer with no available molecularly targeted drugs.
Subjects using opioids on a chronic basis have been reported to have a high prevalence of abnormal sleep architecture and central sleep apnea (CSA). The severity of CSA is, in part, related to blood opioid concentration. The aim of this study was to investigate subjective daytime sleepiness and daytime function in patients who are on stable methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and to assess the possible mechanisms involving abnormal sleep architecture, CSA severity, and blood methadone concentration.
Fifty patients on MMT and 20 normal control subjects matched for age and body mass index were tested using polysomnography, blood toxicology, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
The patients receiving MMT had significantly worse daytime function, were depressed, and had increased daytime sleepiness when compared with the control subjects (FOSQ 15.47 +/- 3.19 vs 19.4 +/- 0.47, BDI 14.64 +/- 10.58 vs 2.05 +/- 2.46, ESS 7.1 +/- 5 vs 2.05 +/- 1.76; all p values < 0.001). Nevertheless, daytime sleepiness in the patients receiving MMT was, on average, within the normal range (ESS < or = 10). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the severity of CSA, blood methadone concentration, and abnormalities in sleep architecture were not significant in predicting the variance of ESS or FOSQ (all p values > 0.05) in these patients receiving MMT. The BDI was the best predictive variable for FOSQ, explaining 16% of the variance (p = 0.004).
Patients on stable MMT have, in general, normal subjective daytime sleepiness but impaired daytime function that partially relates to depression. The changes in sleep architecture, presence of CSA, and blood methadone concentrations do not significantly affect subjective daytime sleepiness and daytime function in these patients.
Lamivudine has been shown to be an effective therapy for chronic hepatitis B, but resistance to this nucleoside agent is common after prolonged use. Five patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection developed resistance to lamivudine after 9 to 19 months of treatment. In 4 patients this occurred after liver transplantation and the remaining individual had stable cirrhosis. In each case, resistance was confirmed to be caused by one or more mutations in the HBV-DNA polymerase gene and was associated with active underlying liver disease. The patients were treated with adefovir dipivoxil in a dose of 5 to 30 mg daily. Two to 4 log(10) reductions in HBV-DNA levels were observed in 4 cases, and the fifth patient became negative by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after retransplantation in conjunction with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg). Virologic improvement was associated with stable or declining serum alanine transaminase levels in 4 patients. HBV-DNA suppression has been sustained during a mean treatment period of 13 months (range 11 to 15 months), including 1 patient in whom lamivudine has been discontinued. Mild changes in renal function were observed during treatment in most cases but did not require early discontinuation of the drug. This study provides evidence that adefovir dipivoxil can be an effective treatment for lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants as well as wild-type HBV.
A 13-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, who was being treated with chemotherapy (including vindesine), developed paraplegia without paresthesia, which mimic Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. Spinal fluid analysis showed a normal protein level, vindesine neuropathy seemed to be the cause of the patient's neurological symptoms. The patient seemed to benefit from human normal immunoglobulin therapy and recovered 4 weeks later.
We report a case of myoclonus induced by quetiapine. A 64-year-old man with schizophrenia developed myoclonic jerks when given higher doses of quetiapine. These movements were dose-related and completely abated on reducing the dose. To our knowledge, these movements have not been reported previously as an adverse effect of quetiapine.
The effect of nicotine withdrawal on regional regulation of brain nicotinic receptors was studied in mice after chronic administration of nicotine in the drinking water for 2, 4 or 7 weeks. Two weeks of chronic nicotine administration did not alter the binding of [3H]-nicotine in the midbrain, cortex or cerebellum of the mice, while after both 4-and 7-week treatments a significant increase in the specific [3H]-nicotine binding was observed in cortical and midbrain membranes. In the midbrain, the [3H]-nicotine binding was increased by about 40% in mice withdrawn for 48-72 h from the 4-week chronic nicotine treatment and in mice withdrawn for 48 h from the 7-week treatment. The [3H]-nicotine binding was significantly increased (by 55-65%) in the cortex at 48 h and 72 h after withdrawal from 4-week chronic nicotine and it was even somewhat more increased (by 72-66%) after 7-week treatment. The cortical [3H]-nicotine binding was not altered at 24 h after the 4-week treatment, but in mice withdrawn for 24 h from the 7-week treatment it was increased by 116%. The increases in [3H]-nicotine binding returned to control levels within 1 week after withdrawal. None of the studied treatments affected the [3H]-nicotine binding in the cerebellum. Tolerance towards nicotine-induced locomotor depression was only found in mice withdrawn for 24 h from the 7-week chronic nicotine administration. These findings suggest that at least 4-week chronic nicotine administration in the drinking water is needed before any upregulation of nicotinic receptors can be observed. Furthermore, in our experiments the increase in the [3H]-nicotine binding was seen before behavioural tolerance could be demonstrated. The differences between brain regions in the time course of nicotinic receptor upregulation may reflect variations in nicotinic receptor subunits and their sensitivity to chronic nicotine treatment.
Cheiralgia paresthetica, a mononeuropathy of the superficial branch of the radial nerve, is an uncommon problem, usually resulting from local trauma to the wrist. This report describes a 27-year-old patient who developed subdermal atrophy following local hydrocortisone injection as a treatment for deQuervain's tenosynovitis. Subsequently, she developed linear skin atrophy, a rare complication of steroid injection thought to result from lymphatic spread of the steroid suspension, extending proximally from the initial atrophic area in her hand into her forearm. Soon after wearing a wristwatch on the affected wrist, she developed symptoms of cheiralgia paresthetica. Linear atrophy was found to traverse the superficial radial nerve and was considered to contribute to the symptoms. It is important to be aware that subcutaneous atrophy may follow the lymphatics with injections of steroid.
