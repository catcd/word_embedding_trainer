In the present study, we describe the antinociceptive effect of filicene, a triterpene isolated from Adiantum cuneatum (Adiantaceae) leaves, in several models of pain in mice. When evaluated against acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, filicene (10, 30 and 60 mg/kg, i.p.) produced dose-related inhibition of the number of constrictions, being several times more potent [ID(50)=9.17 (6.27-13.18) mg/kg] than acetaminophen [ID(50)=18.8 (15.7-22.6) mg/kg], diclofenac [ID(50)=12.1(9.40-15.6) mg/kg] and acetylsalicylic acid [ID(50)=24.0(13.1-43.8) mg/kg] in the same doses as those used for the standard drugs. Filicene also produced dose-related inhibition of the pain caused by capsaicin and glutamate, with mean ID(50) values of 11.7 (8.51-16.0) mg/kg and <10 mg/kg, respectively. Its antinociceptive action was significantly reversed by atropine, haloperidol, GABA(A) and GABA(B) antagonists (bicuculline and phaclofen, respectively), but was not affected by L-arginine-nitric oxide, serotonin, adrenergic and the opioid systems. Together, these results indicate that the mechanisms involved in its action are not completely understood, but seem to involve interaction with the cholinergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic and tachykinergic systems.
Tetracyclines exhibit significant anti-inflammatory properties in a variety of rheumatologic and dermatologic conditions. They have also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in certain neurodegenerative disorders. Because ischemic renal injury is characterized by both apoptosis and inflammation, we investigated the therapeutic potential of tetracyclines in a rat model of renal ischemia-reperfusion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent bilateral renal artery clamp for 30 min followed by reperfusion and received either minocycline or saline for 36 h before ischemia. Minocycline reduced tubular cell apoptosis 24 h after ischemia as determined by terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling staining and nuclear morphology. It also decreased cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm and reduced upregulation of p53 and Bax after ischemia. The minocycline-treated group showed a significant reduction in tubular injury and cast formation. In addition, minocycline reduced the number of infiltrating leukocytes, decreased leukocyte chemotaxis both in vitro and ex vivo, and downregulated the expression of ICAM-1. Serum creatinine 24-h postischemia was significantly reduced in the minocycline-treated group. We conclude that minocycline has potent antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties and protects renal function in this model of ischemia-reperfusion. Tetracyclines are among the safest and best-studied antibiotics. They are thus attractive candidates for the therapy of human ischemic acute renal failure.
Currently, no consensus has been reached regarding the management of hyperlipidemia in patients who develop statin-associated myalgia (SAM). Many statin-intolerant patients use alternative lipid-lowering therapies, including red yeast rice. The present trial evaluated the tolerability of red yeast rice versus pravastatin in patients unable to tolerate other statins because of myalgia. The study was conducted in a community-based setting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 43 adults with dyslipidemia and a history of statin discontinuation because of myalgia were randomly assigned to red yeast rice 2,400 mg twice daily or pravastatin 20 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. All subjects were concomitantly enrolled in a 12-week therapeutic lifestyle change program. The primary outcomes included the incidence of treatment discontinuation because of myalgia and a daily pain severity score. The secondary outcomes were muscle strength and plasma lipids. The incidence of withdrawal from medication owing to myalgia was 5% (1 of 21) in the red yeast rice group and 9% (2 of 22) in the pravastatin group (p = 0.99). The mean pain severity did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. No difference was found in muscle strength between the 2 groups at week 4 (p = 0.61), week 8 (p = 0.81), or week 12 (p = 0.82). The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level decreased 30% in the red yeast rice group and 27% in the pravastatin group. In conclusion, red yeast rice was tolerated as well as pravastatin and achieved a comparable reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a population previously intolerant to statins.
Exposure to ambient fine particles [particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm diameter (PM(2.5))] is a potential factor in the exacerbation of asthma. National air quality particle standards consider total mass, not composition or sources, and may not protect against health impacts related to specific components.
We examined associations between daily exposure to fine particle components and sources, and symptoms and medication use in children with asthma.
Children with asthma (n = 149) 4-12 years of age were enrolled in a year-long study. We analyzed particle samples for trace elements (X-ray fluorescence) and elemental carbon (light reflectance). Using factor analysis/source apportionment, we identified particle sources (e.g., motor vehicle emissions) and quantified daily contributions. Symptoms and medication use were recorded on study diaries. Repeated measures logistic regression models examined associations between health outcomes and particle exposures as elemental concentrations and source contributions.
More than half of mean PM(2.5) was attributed to traffic-related sources motor vehicles (42%) and road dust (12%). Increased likelihood of symptoms and inhaler use was largest for 3-day averaged exposures to traffic-related sources or their elemental constituents and ranged from a 10% increased likelihood of wheeze for each 5-microg/m(3) increase in particles from motor vehicles to a 28% increased likelihood of shortness of breath for increases in road dust. Neither the other sources identified nor PM(2.5) alone was associated with increased health outcome risks.
Linking respiratory health effects to specific particle pollution composition or sources is critical to efforts to protect public health. We associated increased risk of symptoms and inhaler use in children with asthma with exposure to traffic-related fine particles.
We treated elderly patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) using a CMD (CPT-11, mitoxantrone [MIT], dexamethasone [DEX]) regimen and studied its safety and efficacy. The subjects were 70-79-year-old patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. CPT-11 at 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2, MIT at 8 mg/m2 on day 3, and DEX at 40 mg/day on days 1-3 were administered once every 3 weeks, and this was performed for six cycles. Eleven (37%) of the 30 patients achieved complete remission and seven patients (23%) achieved partial remission. With a median follow-up period of 32 months, the 3-year survival rate was 28.2% and the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 17.5%. The main adverse drug reaction was hematological toxicity and there were no deaths related to the treatment. B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin T levels did not increase after the treatment and none of the patients showed electrocardiogram or echocardiogram abnormalities. Our results indicate that the CMD regimen is safe in elderly patients and no cardiotoxicities developed as a result of this regimen. In addition, it was effective in patients who had previously been treated with doxorubicin and good treatment results were obtained in elderly patients with relapsed PTCL.
To investigate the incidence of hypotension associated with the use of midazolam for prehospital rapid-sequence intubation (RSI).
A retrospective review was performed using charts from the two aeromedical agencies servicing the authors' region. The RSI protocols used by crews from the northern (north) and the southern (south) parts of the region were identical, with the exception of midazolam dosing. The north crews used 0.1 mg/kg for all patients, while the south crews used 0.1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 5 mg. All patients receiving midazolam for prehospital RSI were pooled, with multiple linear regression used to investigate the relationship between midazolam dose and both hypotension and a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) following RSI. Patients weighing >50 kg and patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) were evaluated separately to determine differences between north and south with regard to midazolam dosing and incidence of hypotension. Multivariate logistical regression was used to test for these differences and for potential confounders such as age, initial SBP, and Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS).
A total of 219 patients were identified from the north (n = 75) and the south (n = 144). Multiple linear regression revealed a statistically significant relationship between midazolam dose and both hypotension and an SBP decrease following RSI. There was no difference between north and south with regard to age, sex, incidence of TBI, initial SBP, or GCS. In patients >50 kg, those from the north received higher doses of midazolam and had a higher incidence of hypotension than those from the south. This relationship was also present in 184 patients with TBI.
The use of midazolam with prehospital RSI is associated with a dose-related incidence of hypotension.
The relative chronotropic and inotropic activity of preferential beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation was investigated in seven healthy male subjects in a randomized within-subject, single-blind study. Two doses of beta 1-selective agonist prenalterol (1 mg/hr or 2 mg/hr) and of beta 2-selective agonist salbutamol (300 micrograms/hr or 600 micrograms/hr) were infused intravenously in four separate sessions, with intervals of at least 48 hr between sessions. At each session cuff blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured and some hemodynamic information on the inotropic state were derived by echocardiography. Both prenalterol and salbutamol induced increases in HR, but tachycardia was greater after salbutamol, whereas the positive inotropic response to beta-stimulation was greater after prenalterol. At comparable HR rises (prenalterol, from 66.0 +/- 5.5 to 72.2 +/- 4 bpm; salbutamol, from 64.6 +/- 6 to 70.0 +/- 7 bpm), inotropic response seemed to be greater after prenalterol than after salbutamol (systolic blood pressure [SBP]: 133.5 +/- 8 and 120.7 +/- 8 mm Hg; mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening [Vcf]: 1.54 +/- 0.13 and 1.31 +/- 0.12 c/s; ejection fraction [EF]: 72.4% +/- 5% and 69.5% +/- 4%; stroke index: 47.4 +/- 4 and 41.7 +/- 3 ml/m2). In presence of a chronotropic effect (HR from 64.6 +/- 6 to 70.0 +/- 7 bpm), the low salbutamol dose did not induce any changes in the indices of inotropism (SBP: from 119.2 +/- 6 to 120.7 +/- 8 mm Hg; mean Vcf: from 1.28 +/- 0.11 to 1.31 +/- 0.12 c/s; EF: from 68.1% +/- 5% to 69.5% +/- 4%; stroke index: from 40.2 +/- 3 to 41.7 +/- 3 ml/m2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
We investigated the link between anxiety and smoking cessation. Cessation of smoking was found to correlate with increased anxiety in smokers.
Physicians are often asked to predict outcome after acute stroke. Very little information is available that can reliably predict the likelihood of severe disability or death.
To develop a practical method for predicting a poor outcome after acute ischemic stroke.
Data from the placebo arms of Parts 1 and 2 of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt-PA [recombinant tissue plasminogen activator] Stroke Trial were used to identify variables that could predict a poor outcome, defined as moderately severe disability, severe disability, or death (Modified Rankin Scale score >3) 3 months after stroke.
Baseline variables that predicted poor outcome were the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) >17 plus atrial fibrillation, yielding a positive predictive value (PPV) of 96% (95% CI, 88 to 100%). The best predictor at 24 hours was NIHSS >22, yielding a PPV of 98% (95% CI, 93 to 100%). The best predictor at 7 to 10 days was NIHSS >16, yielding a PPV of 92% (95% CI, 85 to 99%).
Patients with a severe neurologic deficit after acute ischemic stroke, as measured by the NIHSS, have a poor prognosis. During the first week after acute ischemic stroke, it is possible to identify a subset of patients who are highly likely to have a poor outcome. These findings require confirmation in a separate study.
Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an important mediator of cancer cell growth and proliferation. Production of S1P is catalyzed by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK). Safingol, (l-threo-dihydrosphingosine) is a putative inhibitor of SphK. We conducted a phase I trial of safingol (S) alone and in combination with cisplatin (C).
A 3 + 3 dose escalation was used. For safety, S was given alone 1 week before the combination. S + C were then administered every 3 weeks. S was given over 60 to 120 minutes, depending on dose. Sixty minutes later, C was given over 60 minutes. The C dose of 75 mg/m(2) was reduced in cohort 4 to 60 mg/m(2) due to excessive fatigue.
Forty-three patients were treated, 41 were evaluable for toxicity, and 37 for response. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was S 840 mg/m(2) over 120 minutes C 60 mg/m(2), every 3 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) attributed to cisplatin included fatigue and hyponatremia. DLT from S was hepatic enzyme elevation. S pharmacokinetic parameters were linear throughout the dose range with no significant interaction with C. Patients treated at or near the MTD achieved S levels of more than 20 μmol/L and maintained levels greater than and equal to 5 μmol/L for 4 hours. The best response was stable disease in 6 patients for on average 3.3 months (range 1.8-7.2 m). One patient with adrenal cortical cancer had significant regression of liver and lung metastases and another had prolonged stable disease. S was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in S1P in plasma.
Safingol, the first putative SphK inhibitor to enter clinical trials, can be safely administered in combination with cisplatin. Reversible dose-dependent hepatic toxicity was seen, as expected from preclinical data. Target inhibition was achieved with downregulation of S1P. The recommended phase II dose is S 840 mg/m(2) and C 60 mg/m(2), every 3 weeks.
NXY-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant that reduces infarct size and preserves brain function in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. Acute ischemic stroke patients receiving NXY-059 may also be exposed to diuretics for treatment of heart failure or hypertension. NXY-059 and furosemide are partly eliminated by active tubular secretion via an organic anion transporter. This double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study investigated whether an infusion of NXY-059 (15 mg/mL) during 12 hours affects the diuretic and saluretic effects of a 30-mg intravenous bolus dose of furosemide (10 mg/mL) administered after 6 hours' infusion, in 13 male and 11 female healthy subjects. The net increase in urine volume and sodium excretion in the interval of 6 to 12 hours was 4.15 L and 178 mmol/L, respectively, during NXY-059 treatment (P = .93) and 4.34 L and 190 mmol/L, respectively, during placebo treatment (P = .54). NXY-059 reduced the renal clearance of furosemide by 19% (P = .019), and furosemide reduced the renal clearance of NXY-059 by 8% (P = .005). NXY-059 was well tolerated.
A 30-year-old cocaine-dependent man who was a subject in a study evaluating the anticraving efficacy of the stimulant medication diethylpropion (DEP) became manic during his second week on the study drug. Pupillometric changes while on DEP, especially changes in the total power of pupillary oscillation, were dramatically different than those observed in the eight other study subjects who did not become manic. The large changes in total power of pupillary oscillation occurred a few days before the patient became fully manic. Such medication-associated changes in the total power of pupillary oscillation might be of utility in identifying persons at risk for manic-like adverse effects during the medical use of psychomotor stimulants or sympathomimetic agents.
Lenalidomide is a potent, novel thalidomide analog that has demonstrated promising clinical activity in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). It is a lead immunomodulatory drug currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolic events are common adverse effects associated with lenalidomide therapy in patients with MM. Careful monitoring of those known serious adverse effects is essential to prevent life-threatening complications. This article discusses lenalidomide's mechanisms of action, clinical trial results, and the management of common adverse effects in patients with MM.
To examine the possible contribution of sedation with propofol in the deaths of children who were intubated and required intensive care.
Case note review.
Three intensive care units.
Five children with upper respiratory tract infections aged between 4 weeks and 6 years.
Four patients had laryngotracheo-bronchitis and one had bronchiolitis. All were sedated with propofol. The clinical course in all five cases was remarkably similar: an increasing metabolic acidosis was associated with brady-arrhythmia and progressive myocardial failure, which did not respond to resuscitative measures. All children developed lipaemic serum after starting propofol. These features are not usually associated with respiratory tract infections. No evidence was found of viral myocarditis, which was considered as a possible cause of death.
Although the exact cause of death in these children could not be defined, propofol may have been a contributing factor.
Binge drinking has been associated with cerebral dysfunction. Ethanol induced microglial activation initiates an inflammatory process that causes upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines which in turn creates neuronal inflammation and damage. However, the molecular mechanism is not fully understood. We postulate that cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP), a novel proinflammatory molecule, can contribute to alcohol-induced neuroinflammation. To test this theory male wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to alcohol at concentrations consistent to binge drinking and blood and brain tissues were collected. At 5 h after alcohol, a significant increase of 53% in the brain of CIRP mRNA was observed and its expression remained elevated at 10 h and 15 h. Brain CIRP protein levels were increased by 184% at 10 h and remained high at 15 h. We then exposed male WT and CIRP knockout (CIRP(-/-)) mice to alcohol, and blood and brain tissues were collected at 15 h post-alcohol infusion. Serum levels of tissue injury markers (AST, ALT and LDH) were significantly elevated in alcohol-exposed WT mice while they were less increased in the CIRP(-/-) mice. Brain TNF-α mRNA and protein expressions along with IL-1β protein levels were significantly increased in WT mice, which was not seen in the CIRP(-/-) mice. In cultured BV2 cells (mouse microglia), ethanol at 100 mM showed an increase of CIRP mRNA by 274% and 408% at 24 h and 48 h respectively. Corresponding increases in TNF-α and IL-1β were also observed. CIRP protein levels were markedly increased in the medium, suggesting that CIRP was secreted by the BV2 cells. From this we conclude that alcohol exposure activates microglia to produce and secrete CIRP and possibly induce pro-inflammatory response and thereby causing neuroinflammation. CIRP could be a novel mediator of alcohol-induced brain inflammation.
The neonatal form of Bartter syndrome is characterized by intrauterine onset of polyuria leading to severe polyhydramnios. We report a patient with the early onset of the syndrome and a similar history in a previous sibling who died in early neonatal life. The patient is a female product of 33 weeks of gestation complicated by severe polyhydramnios. Her birth weight was 2,100 g. Polyuria led to severe dehydration on the 3rd day of life. Laboratory studies showed hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and elevated plasma levels of renin and aldosterone. Hypercalciuria was associated with echographic evidence of nephrocalcinosis. Indomethacin therapy resulted in a significant reduction in urine volume and correction of biochemical abnormalities. Growth and development are satisfactory after 4 years of indomethacin therapy, but nephrocalcinosis remains unchanged.
Increased oxidative stress and energy metabolism deficit have been regarded as an important underlying cause for neuronal damage induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In this study, we investigated the oxidative mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol, a potent polyphenol antioxidant found in grapes, on structural and biochemical abnormalities in rats subjected to global cerebral ischemia. Experimental model of transient global cerebral ischemia was induced in Wistar rats by the four vessel occlusion method for 10 min and followed by different periods of reperfusion. Nissl and fluoro jade C stained indicated extensive neuronal death at 7 days after I/R. These findings were preceded by a rapid increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), lipid peroxidation, as well as by a decrease in Na(+)K(+)-ATPase activity and disrupted antioxidant defenses (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) in hippocampus and cortex. Administrating resveratrol 7 days prior to ischemia by intraperitoneal injections (30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated neuronal death in both studied structures, as well as decreased the generation of ROS, lipid peroxidation and NO content. Furthermore, resveratrol brought antioxidant and Na(+)K(+)-ATPase activity in cortex and hippocampus back to normal levels. These results support that resveratrol could be used as a preventive, or therapeutic, agent in global cerebral ischemia and suggest that scavenging of ROS contributes, at least in part, to resveratrol-induced neuroprotection.
We studied the cellular function of Nell-1, a craniosynostosis-related gene, in craniofacial development. Nell-1 modulates calvarial osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis pathways. Nell-1 overexpression disrupts these pathways resulting in craniofacial anomalies such as premature suture closure.
Craniosynostosis (CS), one of the most common congenital craniofacial deformities, is the premature closure of cranial sutures. Previously, we reported NELL-1 as a novel molecule overexpressed during premature cranial suture closure in patients with CS. Nell-1 overexpression induced calvarial overgrowth and resulted in premature suture closure in a rodent model. On a cellular level, Nell-1 is suggested to promote osteoblast differentiation.
Different levels of Nell-1 were introduced into osteoblastic cells by viral infection and recombinant protein. Apoptosis and gene expression assays were performed. Mice overexpressing Nell-1 were examined for apoptosis.
In this report, we further showed that overexpression of Nell-1 induced apoptosis along with modulation of apoptosis-related genes. The induction of apoptosis by Nell-1 was observed only in osteoblastic cells and not in NIH3T3 or primary fibroblasts. The CS mouse model overexpressing Nell-1 showed increased levels of apoptosis in the calvaria.
We show that Nell-1 expression modulates calvarial osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis pathways. Nell-1 overexpression disrupts these pathways resulting in craniofacial anomalies such as premature suture closure.
We investigated promotion potential of ethanol after initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis in male, 21-day-old, F344 rats by exposure to 10 ppm 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline pellet diet for 8 weeks. The rats in group 1 were then fed on liquid control diet for 16 weeks, group 2 receiving the same diet containing 5% ethanol for 8 weeks followed by 8 weeks on the control diet, while group 3 animals were given 5% ethanol containing liquid diet for the entire16 weeks. On sacrifice at the end of week 24, glutathione S-transferase placental form positive foci, putative preneoplastic lesions in the liver, cell proliferation as indicated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemical staining and levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, were significantly increased in the liver of group 3 along with non significant alteration of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase mRNA expression. Lack of persistent increase of above parameters was found in transient ethanol exposure group. These results suggest that chronic consumption of ethanol promotes hepatocarcinogenesis by increasing oxidative stress and cell proliferation. It is also evident that abstinence of ethanol during the second stage stops its persistent promotion effect.
Polycystin-2 (PC2), encoded by the PKD2 gene, mutated in 10-15% of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients, is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel present in kidney epithelia and other tissues. As PC2 was found expressed in B-lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) and Ca2+ signaling pathways are important regulators of B cell function activities, we investigated whether PC2 plays some role in B-LCLs. In LCLs, PC2 was found mainly in ER membranes but ~8 times less than in kidney HEK293 cells. The same reductions were found in PKD2 and PKD1 RNA; thus, PKD genes maintained, in LCLs, the same reciprocal proportion as they do in kidney cells. In LCLs obtained from subjects carrying PKD2 mutations (PKD2-LCLs) and showing reduced PC2 levels, intracellular Ca2+ concentrations evoked by platelet-activating factor (PAF), were significantly lower than in non-PKD-LCLs. This reduction was also found in PKD1-LCLs but without PC2 reductions. Likewise, cell proliferation, which is controlled by Ca2+, was reduced in PKD2- and PKD1-LCLs. Moreover, in LCLs with PKD2 nonsense mutations, aminoglycoside antibiotics reduced the PC2 defect by promoting readthrough of stop codons. Therefore, PC2 and PC1 are functionally expressed in LCLs, which provide a model, easily obtainable from ADPKD patients, to study PKD gene expression and function.
Encephalopathy is a rare drug toxicity of fluorouracil therapy. Toxicity from fluorouracil therapy is known to be associated with the individual genetic background of the enzymes, thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.
Two patients with advanced gastric cancer and metastatic pancreatic cancer who received 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy presented with acute mental change and hyperammonemia. To evaluate the genetic background of the fluorouracil-associated hyperammonemic encephalopathy, analysis of the polymorphisms of the TYMS, DPYD and MTHFR genes was performed.
The patients revealed to be TYMS suppressors showing homogenous deletion of 6 bp in the 3'-UTR and 3RC/3RC genotype in the promoter enhancer region (TSER), respectively.
Genetic polymorphisms of the TYMS gene would contribute to the 5-fluorouracil-associated hyperammonemic encephalopathy. The prospective validation of the clinical implication of TYMS gene polymorphisms is warranted.
Current treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) rely on dopamine-replacing strategies, and centre around dopamine precursors (e.g. levodopa) or directly acting dopamine agonists. With long-term therapy these agents lose much of their clinical utility due to the appearance of adverse effects such as dyskinesias and/or a wearing off of efficacy. Although dyskinesias in Huntington's disease, hemiballism and experimental animals are thought to be associated with reductions in amino acid transmission within the lateral and medial segments of the globus pallidus, the neural mechanisms underlying treatment-related dyskinesias in PD are poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that, within these regions of the brain, the opioid peptides enkephalin and dynorphin, acting at delta and kappa opioid receptors, respectively, can reduce the release of amino acid transmitters. Furthermore, the synthesis of these peptides appears to be enhanced in neurons projecting to the pallidal complex in animal models of PD following repeated treatment with dopamine-replacing agents that also cause dyskinetic adverse effects (e.g. levodopa and apomorphine). In contrast, dopamine receptor agonists such as bromocriptine and lisuride do not cause dyskinetic adverse effects following long-term treatment, and do not elevate peptide synthesis when given de novo. These data, together with recent data on the behavioural effects of opioid antagonists in a rodent model of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD, suggest the possibility that antagonists of opioid receptors may prove useful as adjuncts to levodopa. By limiting the severity of dyskinetic adverse effects, these drugs may help extend the time for which the antiparkinsonian effects of such compounds can be usefully exploited.
The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of and pharmacokinetic parameters associated with the development of transient encephalopathy following the administration of high-dose methotrexate and intrathecal chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Two hundred and fifty-nine children with newly diagnosed ALL treated on one of two consecutive trials were analyzed. Presenting features in patients who developed transient encephalopathy were compared with those of patients who did not experience this event. For each patient who developed transient encephalopathy, methotrexate pharmacokinetic parameters were compared with those of matched controls. The cumulative incidence of acute encephalopathy was 3% (SE 1%) at 1 year and was associated with age greater than or equal to 10 years at diagnosis. Pharmacokinetic data did not differ between patients who developed transient encephalopathy and those who did not. The majority of patients had no long-term sequelae and were able to receive further courses of methotrexate without modification. Transient focal neurologic deficits occur in about 3% of children with ALL following the administration of intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate. These events cannot be predicted by pharmacokinetic parameters Of methotrexate disposition. However, these events are generally benign, suggesting that patients who experience acute encephalopathy should continue to receive this important chemotherapeutic agent.
The effects of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), an agent shown previously to induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells through inhibition of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) translation, have been examined in Bcr/Abl(+) leukemia cells resistant to imatinib mesylate (IM). When administered at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (10-15 microM), sorafenib potently induced apoptosis in imatinib mesylate-resistant cells expressing high levels of Bcr/Abl, cells exhibiting a Bcr/Abl-independent, Lyn-dependent form of resistance, and CD34(+) cells obtained from imatinib-resistant patients. In addition, Ba/F3 cells expressing mutations rendering them resistant to IM (e.g., E255K, M351T) or to IM, dasatinib, and nilotinib (T315I) remained fully sensitive to sorafenib. Induction of apoptosis by sorafenib was associated with rapid and pronounced down-regulation of Mcl-1 and diminished signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 phosphorylation and reporter activity but only very modest and delayed inactivation of the Bcr/Abl downstream target Crkl. Moreover, transfection with a constitutively active STAT5 construct partially but significantly protected cells from sorafenib lethality. Ba/F3 cells expressing Bcr/Abl mutations were as sensitive to sorafenib-induced Mcl-1 down-regulation and dephosphorylation of STAT5 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E as wild-type cells. Finally, stable knockdown of Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) with short hairpin RNA in K562 cells significantly diminished sorafenib lethality, arguing strongly for a functional role of this proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member in the lethality of this agent. Together, these findings suggest that sorafenib effectively induces apoptosis in highly imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, most likely by inhibiting or down-regulating targets (i.e., STAT5 and Mcl-1) downstream or independent of Bcr/Abl.
Everolimus (RAD001) is an orally administered inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a therapeutic target for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We did a phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of everolimus in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma whose disease had progressed on vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy.
Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma which had progressed on sunitinib, sorafenib, or both, were randomly assigned in a two to one ratio to receive everolimus 10 mg once daily (n=272) or placebo (n=138), in conjunction with best supportive care. Randomisation was done centrally via an interactive voice response system using a validated computer system, and was stratified by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prognostic score and previous anticancer therapy, with a permuted block size of six. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed via a blinded, independent central review. The study was designed to be terminated after 290 events of progression. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00410124.
All randomised patients were included in efficacy analyses. The results of the second interim analysis indicated a significant difference in efficacy between arms and the trial was thus halted early after 191 progression events had been observed (101 [37%] events in the everolimus group, 90 [65%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.22-0.40, p<0.0001; median progression-free survival 4.0 [95% CI 3.7-5.5] vs 1.9 [1.8-1.9] months). Stomatitis (107 [40%] patients in the everolimus group vs 11 [8%] in the placebo group), rash (66 [25%] vs six [4%]), and fatigue (53 [20%] vs 22 [16%]) were the most commonly reported adverse events, but were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Pneumonitis (any grade) was detected in 22 (8%) patients in the everolimus group, of whom eight had pneumonitis of grade 3 severity.
Treatment with everolimus prolongs progression-free survival relative to placebo in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that had progressed on other targeted therapies.
Oral administration of chloramphenicol did not significantly alter the early stage of chronic hypoplastic marrow failure induced by busulfan. Chloramphenicol reduction products were most suppressive to antigen-reactive cells detected by the Mishell-Dutton plaque-forming cell assay. This reduction in immunocompetence may be an important parameter in the initial phases of the etiology of chloramphenicol-induced aplastic anemia.
Acute psychosis is a rare central nervous system side effect of indomethacin or sulindac. A case directly associated with its use is here presented with a brief review of the literature.
Agonists at kappa-opioid receptors may preserve the analgesic properties of mu-opioidergic agonists while avoiding their major adverse effects. The present study was aimed to investigate the antinociceptive effects of the new kappa-opioid receptor agonist RP 60180. An experimental pain model was used based on specific pain stimuli and event-related potentials. Effects of RP 60180 were compared to placebo and to pentazocine that served as positive control. Twenty healthy male volunteers participated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, five-way cross-over study. Single peroral doses of RP 60180 (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg), pentazocine (50 mg), and placebo were administered. Pain was induced by means of short pulses of gaseous CO2 applied to the nasal mucosa. In response to these stimuli, chemo-somatosensory event-related potentials (CSSERP) and pain ratings were recorded. Maximum antinociceptive effects were observed 2 h after the administration of 1.0 mg of RP 60180 and 50 mg of pentazocine. This was shortly after RP 60180 had reached the maximum plasma concentration and when highest plasma concentrations of pentazocine were measured. Both RP 60180 and pentazocine reduced pain-related CSSERP amplitudes by approximately 40% at this time. Pentazocine tended to produce more side effects. These results indicate the potential therapeutic value of kappa-agonist analgesics.
