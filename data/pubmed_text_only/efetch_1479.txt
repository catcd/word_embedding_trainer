Digoxin therapy was evaluated retrospectively in a group of 30, and prospectively in a group of 16 low-birth-weight, premature infants with cardiorespiratory symptoms due to persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus. The response to decongestive therapy was equivocal. Digoxin levels in serum varied between 1.5 and 13 ng/ml. Digoxin half-life in serum exceeded three days in four patients. Fourteen of the combined group of 46 infants had signs of toxicity of digoxin. High dosage, inadvertent overadministration, and variable clearance of digoxin, as well as special characteristics of the patients studied, are postulated as explanations for the high incidence of toxicity. This study suggests that digoxin therapy in low-birth-weight, premature infants with patent ductus arteriosus is not without risk.
Two cases of nephrotoxicity associated with piroxicam therapy are reported. In the first case, severe reversible azotemia with hyperkalemia resolved after discontinuation of the medication. In the second case, biopsy-proved acute interstitial nephritis with immune complex glomerulonephritis and hepatitis improved after steroid therapy. The mechanism for such toxicity may be altered hemodynamics, cellular immunity, or humoral immunity related to prostaglandin inhibition.
Clozapine (CLZ) is the most effective therapeutic alternative in the treatment of resistant schizophrenia. However, the cardiotoxicity of CLZ, particularly in young patients, has raised concerns about its safety. Captopril is a well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with antioxidant properties effective in treating hypertension and heart failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of captopril against clozapine-induced myocarditis in rats and the possible mechanisms behind this effect. The effect of captopril treatment [5 or 10mg/kg/d, injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 21days] on the cardiotoxic effect of coadministered CLZ (25mg/kg/d, i.p.) was assessed. Myocarditis was assessed histopathologically, immunohistochemically and biochemically. Frozen heart specimens were used to determine the amount of lipid peroxides product (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î± and IL-10) and DNA degradation product(8-OHdG). Coadministration of captopril with the tested doses of CLZ decreased the histological hallmarks and biochemical markers (CK-MP and LDH) of myocarditis. In addition, captopril attenuated the effects of CLZ on oxidative stress parameters, NO and serum and cardiac 8-OHdG levels. Captopril significantly attenuated the effect of CLZ on all measured parameters in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that captopril exerts a protective action against CLZ-induced myocarditis. Multiple mechanisms contribute to this effect, including a decrease in cardiac oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines production, modulation of antioxidant status and protection from oxidative DNA damage. Hence, captopril may be effective in reducing the incidence and severity of CLZ-induced myocarditis in humans.
Twenty-six women with metastatic breast cancer were treated with intensive Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) as a single agent administered for three successive days once a month. Dosing started at 25 or 30 mg/m2/d three times, and was escalated by 5 mg/m2/d monthly to maximal tolerance based on hematologic, mucosal, or cardiac toxicities. Four patients (15%) had complete remissions (CRs) pathologically proven, and six others (23%) sustained complete CRs, but were found to have microscopic residual tumor (three) or refused biopsy (three). Twelve patients (46%) attained partial remission (PR). The overall response (85%) and CR rates (38%) were approximately double those reported with conventional Adriamycin doses. Median unmaintained remission duration for the ten patients in CR was 11 months. Cardiotoxicity, determined by radionuclide physiologic studies, occurred in 16 patients at a mean dose of 459 mg/m2; three patients developed reversible congestive failure. There were no toxic deaths. The median overall survival was 18 months. These data suggest that there is steep dose responsiveness to Adriamycin in metastatic breast cancer, and that more effective techniques for using Adriamycin may exist than those conventionally used.
Rectal acetaminophen (Ac) is often administered prophylactically at anesthesia induction for postoperative pain management in small children and is thought to have an opioid-sparing effect. We assessed in this double-blinded, prospective, randomized study early opioid requirements after three doses of Ac (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg versus placebo) in 80 children (ASA physical status I, age 11.4 +/- 9.9 mo) undergoing cleft palate repair. Single Ac plasma concentrations were measured. Pain scores assessed in the postanesthesia care unit of > or = 4 of 10 resulted in the IV administration of 25 microg/kg piritramide, a popular European mu receptor agonist (lockout time, 10 min; maximum 0.125 mg/kg). There were no significant differences between groups with regard to the early postoperative pain scores and the overall cumulative IV opioid requirements. Maximal plasma concentrations achieved were only subtherapeutic (Ac 10 mg/kg: 8 microg/mL; Ac 20 mg/kg: 13 microg/mL; Ac 40 mg/kg: 21 microg/mL after 122, 122, and 121 min, respectively). We conclude that rectal Ac up to 40 mg/kg has no opioid-sparing effect, does not result in analgesic Ac plasma concentrations, and lacks proof of its efficacy in infants and small children undergoing cleft palate repair, whereas titrated IV opioid boluses produced rapid and reliable pain relief.
Acetaminophen is widely used prophylactically for postoperative analgesia in children and is thought to have an opioid-sparing effect. We showed that rectal acetaminophen up to 40 mg/kg administered at anesthesia induction lacked proof of efficacy, whereas IV opioid boluses resulted in reliable pain relief in children undergoing cleft palate repair.
CD4+ T-cells are considered as pivotal in orchestrating the airway inflammation in asthma through the actions of their cytokines. Current hypothesis suggests that the anti-asthma effect of theophylline may be due to its anti-inflammatory actions, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. The in vitro effect of theophylline on cytokine gene expression in peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells in normal subjects was compared with that of dexamethasone and salbutamol. CD4+ T-cells were cultured with phytohaemagglutin and phorbol myristate acetate in the presence of different concentrations of theophylline (10(-8)-10(-3) M or 0.0018-180 microg x mL(-1)) in one group of subjects (n=8), dexamethasone (10(-9)-10(-6) M or 0.39-390 ng x mL(-1)) in a second group (n=8) and salbutamol (10(-9)-10(-4) M or 0.00058-58 microg x mL(-1)) in a third group (n=8). Gene expression of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interferon (IFN)-gamma was semiquantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Suppressed expression of IL-3 (36.9%), IL4 (38.8%), GM-CSF (24.6%) and IFN-gamma (37.7%), but not of IL-5, was only seen with theophylline at a concentration of 10(-3) M (180 microg x mL(-1)) (p<0.05) and not at lower concentrations. In contrast, dexamethasone caused a dose-dependent suppression of transcription of all cytokines, with 39.5% for IL-3, 84.4% for IL-4, 40.6% for IL-5, 50.9% for GM-CSF and 31.8% for IFN-gamma at 10(-6) M (390 ng x mL(-1)) (p<0.05-0.001). Salbutamol did not suppress gene expression of any of the cytokines at the concentrations examined. These data suggest that cytokine gene expression of CD4+ T-cells is not affected at therapeutic concentrations of theophylline and salbutamol, but its suppression is likely to be an important mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids in asthma.
Influences of the manipulation of brain catecholaminergic neuronal activity on the incidence of lidocaine-induced convulsions in mice were studied and compared with those of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT) decreased both brain noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) levels, and disulfiram decreased the NA level and increased the DA level. The incidence of lidocaine-induced convulsions was decreased by treatments with alpha-MPT and disulfiram, while that of PTZ was increased by either treatment. The incidence of lidocaine-induced convulsions was slightly, but not significantly increased by L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), although the brain DA level was increased by L-DOPA. Methamphetamine and desipramine increased the incidences of lidocaine-induced convulsions. These results may suggest that brain catecholaminergic neurons, differing from their role in inhibiting control of PTZ-seizure, act to facilitate lidocaine-induced convulsions.
Ceruloplasmin, a multi-copper ferroxidase that affects the distribution of tissue iron, has antioxidant effects through the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron. Aceruloplasminemia is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism due to the complete lack of ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity caused by mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene. It is characterized by iron accumulation in the brain as well as visceral organs. Clinically, the disease consists of the triad of retinal degeneration, diabetes mellitus, and neurological disease, which include ataxia, involuntary movements, and dementia. These symptoms reflect the sites of iron deposition. The unique involvement of the central nervous system distinguishes aceruloplasminemia from other inherited and acquired iron storage disorders. Twenty-one mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene have been reported in 24 families worldwide. In Japan, the incidence was estimated to be approximately one per 2,000,000 in the case of non-consanguineous marriages. Excess iron functions as a potent catalyst of biologic oxidation. Previously we showed that an increased iron concentration is associated with increased levels of lipid peroxidation in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and erythrocyte membranes. The levels of malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenals, indicators of lipid peroxidation, were also elevated in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. Positron emission tomography showed diminished brain metabolism of glucose and oxygen. Enzyme activities in the mitochondrial respiratory chain of the basal ganglia were reduced to approximate 45% and 42%, respectively, for complexes I and IV. These findings suggest that iron-mediated free radicals causes neuronal cell damage through lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction in aceruloplasminemia brains.
FOLFOX/FOLFIRI chemotherapy is usually applied through central venous catheters because of possible occurrence of phlebitis during application of these regimen via peripheral vein. However, the exact frequency and degree of the problems at peripheral venous access site during FOLFOX/FOLFIRI chemotherapy via peripheral vein in the clinical setting has not been reported previously. We investigated the frequency of infusion failure and phlebitis in 43 patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer who received FOLFOX4, mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI chemotherapy in our institution. After informed consent, FOLFOX/FOLFIRI chemotherapy was applied via peripheral vein in 29 cases; all courses (13.1+/-8.1 (Mean+/-SD)courses, 5-FU: 3,510+/-743 mg/body/course) were completed via peripheral vein in the 20 cases (70%). In the other 9 cases, the access site was converted to the central vein because of the problems of access site following completion of 5.9+/-2.0 courses via peripheral vein. Fifty eight times of phlebitis were recognized during total of 301 courses; severe phlebitis requiring medical treatment was not recognized in any case. Seventy seven times of the change of venous access site were required during total of 301 courses. These data would be essential for the exact informed consent for choosing the access site for FOLFOX/FOLFIRI chemotherapy.
Sudden hearing loss has been reported on standard interferon (IFN)-alpha2 therapy. This is the first report on the occurrence of sudden hearing loss in six cases of chronic hepatitis C in temporal relation to treatment with pegylated (PEG)-IFN alfa2a or b/ribavirin combination therapy. Three patients were treated in an ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing the addition of 200 mg amantadine or placebo to the combination of 180 microg PEG-IFN alpha2a (PEGASYS, Roche, Basel, CH)/wk and 1-1.2 g ribavirin/d (COPEGUS, Roche, Nutley, USA) in de novo patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Sudden hearing loss and tinnitus developed on day 1 and after 4, 23, 25, 36, and 40 wk of treatment, respectively.
Sudden hearing loss may occur in about 1% of patients on PEG-IFN/ribavirin combination therapy. This rate was not different to that observed in an untreated population. Possible mechanisms involved include direct ototoxicity of IFN, autoimmunity, and hematological changes. In contrast to published cases on auditory disability due to standard IFN, hearing loss did not fully resolve after discontinuation of therapy with PEG-IFN. On the other hand, symptoms did not worsen on continued treatment. Therefore, the decision whether to continue or to stop the treatment when signs of ototoxicity appear is based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician.
Increasing evidence supports an important role for metals in neurobiology. In fact, copper binding proteins that form bioinorganic complexes are able to display oxidant or anti-oxidant properties, which would impact on neuronal function or in the triggering of neurodegenerative process. Two proteins related to neurodegenerative diseases have been described as copper binding proteins: the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a protein related to Alzheimer's disease, and the Prion protein (PrP), related to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. We used different synthetic peptides from APP and PrP sequences in order to evaluate the ability to reduce copper. We observed that APP(135-156), amyloid-beta-peptide (A beta(1-40)), and PrP(59-91) all have copper reducing ability, with the APP(135-156) peptide being more potent than the other fragments. Moreover, we identify His, Cys and Trp residues as key amino acids involved in the copper reduction of A beta, APP and PrP, respectively. We postulated, that in a cellular context, the interaction of these proteins with copper could be necessary to reduce copper on plasma membrane, possibly presenting Cu(I) to the copper transporter, driving the delivery of this metal to antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, protein-metal complexes could be the catalytic centers for the formation of reactive oxygen species involved in the oxidative damage present both in Alzheimer's and Prion disease.
The effect of the addition of a diuretic, bendrofluazide, for 1 month was studied in 12 hypertensive patients who were already on treatment with nifedipine tablets (20 mg b.i.d.) When nifedipine was maximally effective, that is, at 2 hours after the last dose, the diuretic had no further blood-pressure-lowering effect. These results suggest that unlike most other blood-pressure-lowering agents, there is little point in giving a diuretic to patients who are already on nifedipine, and if blood pressure is not controlled on nifedipine alone, it may be more effective to add either a beta blocker or a converting enzyme inhibitor. This has the advantage of avoiding the metabolic problems of diuretics.
Allergic anaphylactic (type I) reactions to corticosteroid medications are uncommon; however, a number of well-documented cases have been reported. We present a review of the literature, and report on two patients who suffered anaphylaxis after injections of corticosteroids. The first patient, a registered nurse, was finally found to be sensitive to all corticosteroid preparations containing carboxymethylcellulose, as well as the pure carboxymethylcellulose. The second patient had positive skin tests to hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone sodium succinate, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and suxamethonium. Both patients were tested on two occasions; four normal subjects were tested in parallel, and did not elicit any positive skin reaction. In patients with systemic severe reactions to injectable corticosteroids, we recommend careful and comprehensive skin testing with most available corticosteroids, as well as the components of the injectables.
(1) Between 20% and 30% of newborns exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) towards the end of gestation have disorders such as agitation, abnormal muscle tone and suction, seizures and hyponatraemia. (2) Worrisome data concerning a possible teratogenic effect were published in late 2005. (3) In a Danish cohort including 1054 pregnant women, the estimated relative risk of all congenital malformations, compared with the general population, among the offspring of women who received a prescription for an SSRI was 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.9), and the relative risk of cardiac malformations was 1.6 (95% CI 1.0-2.6). (4) An American retrospective study compared the newborns of women who were prescribed paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy with all newborns exposed to other antidepressants: 4% of newborns exposed to paroxetine had malformations (2% had cardiac malformations). The estimated relative risk for all congenital malformations was 2.20 (95% CI 1.34-3.63), and the estimated relative risk of cardiovascular malformations was 2.08 (95% CI 1.03-4.23). (5) Analysis of a Swedish birth register provided an estimated relative risk of cardiac malformations associated with paroxetine of 2.22 (95% CI 1.39-3.55) compared with the general population. (6) Another American study showed a global increase in the risk of malformations with paroxetine compared with all antidepressants. The risk of cardiovascular malformations was not significantly increased. (7) In a case-control study based on an American register of birth defects, the estimated relative risk of omphalocele was 3.0 with all SSRIs (95% CI 1.4 to 6.1), and the estimated relative risk of craniosynostosis was 1.8 (95% CI 1.0-3.2). (8) In practice, all SSRIs have been implicated in a possible increase in the risk of congenital malformations, but the most worrisome evidence concerns paroxetine. This potential risk implies that the justification for paroxetine treatment in pregnant women should be carefully weighed; this means double-checking the diagnosis, the potential benefits and adverse effects, and possible alternatives.
Somatostatin was originally isolated from the hypothalamus, but has subsequently been found throughout the whole gastrointestinal tract. It exerts an inhibitory effect upon numerous functions of the body, and, therefore, increasing attention has been focused on its potential as a therapeutic agent with cytoprotective properties and a potent inhibitory action on a wide variety of functions in endocrine diseases, cancer and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, including bleeding from oesophageal varices. As somatostatin has a very short plasma half-life and requires administration by continuous infusion to maintain therapeutic levels, stable long-acting analogues have been developed. The analogue octreotide has been shown to have a plasma half-life of 113 minutes and to produce a profound selective inhibition of growth hormone. Hepatic excretion of octreotide has been estimated to be between 30 and 40% in healthy volunteers; no data are available in cirrhotic patients. A review of published data assessing systemic and hepatic haemodynamics in animals and humans over varying dosage regimens of somatostatin and octreotide reveals that cardiac output, arterial pressure and peripheral resistance are modified more in animals than in humans. Hepatic haemodynamics are significantly altered in animals as well as in humans in most of the studies. Circumstantial evidence is provided indicating that the mechanisms of action of somatostatin and octreotide in the therapy of bleeding oesophageal varices are mainly mediated by a splanchnic vasoconstrictive effect. Furthermore, gastric acid suppression and potential enhancement of platelet aggregation may contribute to the beneficial outcome after treatment of oesophageal varices with somatostatin.
1,1,2-Trichloroethane (TCE) was administered to male and female CD-1 mice to evaluate its effect on standard toxicological parameters. Following determination of the acute LD50 (378 mg/kg in males and 491 mg/kg in females), and a 14-day range-finding study, a 90-day drinking water study was performed in which the doses consumed were 4.4, 46, and 305 mg/kg for males and 3.9, 44, and 384 mg/kg for females. The liver was a target of TCE toxicity in both sexes as demonstrated by dose-dependent alterations in hepatic microsomal enzyme activities and serum enzyme levels. The erythroid element of the female mice was also affected, as indicated by significantly decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin levels.
The aim of this study was to conduct an initial evaluation of the efficacy of atomoxetine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs).
Children with PDDs and a nonverbal IQ of >or=70 received atomoxetine (target dose 1.2-1.4 mg/kg/day) during the course of an 8-week, open-label, prospective study. Standardized assessments of efficacy and tolerability were collected at regular intervals during the trial.
Sixteen children and adolescents (mean age 7.7 +/- 2.2 years, age range 6-14 years) with autistic disorder (n = 7), Asperger's disorder (n = 7), or PDD not otherwise specified (n = 2) received atomoxetine (mean dose 1.2 +/- 0.3 mg/kg/day). Twelve participants (75%) were rated as "much" or "very much improved" on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale. The most significant improvement was seen in the area of ADHD symptoms as measured by the SNAP-IV and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (effect size = 1.0-1.9). Improvements of lesser magnitude (effect size = 0.4-1.1) were seen in irritability, social withdrawal, stereotypy, and repetitive speech. There were no significant changes on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test. Atomoxetine was well tolerated with the exception of 2 participants (13 %) who stopped medication due to irritability. Weight decreased by a mean of 0.8 kg during the 8-week trial.
Placebo-controlled studies are indicated to determine atomoxetine's efficacy for ADHD symptoms in PDDs.
The first episode of psychotic illness is a key intervention point. The initial experience with medication can affect willingness to accept treatment. Further, relapse prevention is a treatment cornerstone during the first years of illness because active psychotic illness may affect lifetime outcomes. Thus, initial treatment of active symptoms and subsequent relapse prevention are central goals of pharmacotherapy. This study compared long-term effectiveness of risperidone versus haloperidol in first-episode psychosis patients.
First-episode psychosis patients (N=555, mean age=25.4 years) participated in a double-blind, randomized, controlled flexible-dose trial that compared risperidone (mean modal dose=3.3 mg) and haloperidol (mean modal dose=2.9 mg). The median treatment length was 206 days (maximum=1,514).
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores and Clinical Global Impression ratings improved significantly relative to baseline, with no significant differences between groups. Three-quarters of the patients achieved initial clinical improvement, defined as >20% reduction in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score. However, among those who achieved clinical improvement, 42% of the risperidone group experienced a relapse compared with 55% of the haloperidol group. The median time to relapse was 466 days for risperidone-treated subjects and 205 days for those given haloperidol. These differences were statistically significant based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Adverse effects distinguished the treatments: there were significantly more extrapyramidal signs and symptoms and adjunctive medication use in the haloperidol group and greater prolactin elevation in the risperidone group. There was less weight gain with haloperidol initially but no significant differences between groups at endpoint.
Relatively low doses of antipsychotic drugs lead to significant symptom amelioration in the majority of first-episode psychosis patients. In the long term, risperidone prevents relapse in more patients and for a longer time and also induces less abnormal movements than haloperidol.
This pilot study examined the effects of atomoxetine on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and autistic features in children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD).
Twelve children (aged 6-14 years) with PDD accompanied by ADHD symptoms entered a 10-week open-label study with atomoxetine (1.19 +/- 0.41 mg/kg/day). Response was assessed by using parent and clinician rating scales with change in the ADHD-Rating Scale (ADHDRS) as primary outcome measure.
Atomoxetine reduced ADHD-symptoms as measured by the ADHDRS (44% decrease vs. baseline, p < 0.003), the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-R:S (CPRS-R) (25% in the subscale "Cognitive Problems," p < 0.028; 32% in "Hyperactivity," p < 0.030; and 23% in "ADHD index," p < 0.023). We found a reduction of 21% (p = 0.071) for changes in the subscale "Hyperactivity" of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). No change was found in any of the other ABC subscales, nor in the subscale "Oppositional" of the CPRS-R. Five patients (42%) discontinued because of side effects. Gastrointestinal symptoms, irritability, sleep problems, and fatigue were the most frequent side effects.
These preliminary findings indicate that atomoxetine may be a promising new agent in the treatment of ADHD symptoms in children with PDD. However, children with PDD may have a higher vulnerability for some of the known side-effects of atomoxetine.
Four out of 23 consecutive patients treated with high-dose Ara-C for lymphomas in our institution developed a strikingly similar syndrome during the perfusion. It was characterized by the onset of fever, diarrhea, shock, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, weight gain and leukocytosis. Thorough bacteriological screening failed to provide evidence of infection. Sequential biological assays of IL-1, IL-2, TNF and PAF were performed during Ara-C infusion to ten patients, including the four who developed the syndrome. TNF and PAF activity was found in the serum of respectively two and four of the cases, but not in the six controls. As TNF and PAF are thought to be involved in the development of septic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome, we hypothesize that high-dose Ara-C may be associated with cytokine release.
The aim of this study was to report on the clinical efficacy and side effects of aripiprazole in treating behavioral symptoms of children with a developmental disability (DDs).
A retrospective chart review of the first 32 children treated with aripiprazole at an urban clinic for children with DD was conducted.
Ages ranged from 5 to 19 years; 9 (28%) were female. Twenty four had diagnoses within the autistic spectrum and 18 had mental retardation (MR). Other disorders included: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder/disruptive behavior disorders (n = 13), mood disorders (n = 7), reactive attachment (n = 2), and sleep disorders (n = 2). Target symptoms included aggression, hyperactivity, impulsivity and, self-injurious behaviors. Twenty eight of the children were switched from another antipsychotic. The mean daily aripiprazole starting dose was 7.1 +/- 0.32 mg (0.17 mg/kg/day) and the mean daily maintenance dose was 10.55 +/- 6.9 mg (0.27 mg/kg/day). Aripiprazole had been used for a period between 6 and 15 months. Improvement in target symptoms was found in 56%. When treating a child with MR, the concomitant presence of an autistic spectrum diagnosis predicted a worse outcome. Side effects were reported in 16 (50%), with the most frequent being sleepiness (n = 6). Mean body mass index (BMI) rose from 22.5 to 24.1 (p = 0.003) over the follow up period, with changes in the BMI z scores. These changes were more pronounced in children younger than 12 years.
These results with aripiprazole in this difficult-to-treat population suggest that this medication warrants controlled studies of its effectiveness and safety.
Little is known about the neuropsychological effects of risperidone in children with pervasive developmental disorders.
Twenty-four children (aged 5-17 years) with pervasive developmental disorders and co-morbid disruptive behavior who responded favorably to open-label treatment with risperidone as part of a previously described controlled discontinuation study completed two different computerized attention tasks at baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 24 of open-label treatment, and, at 8 weeks after random assignment to either placebo or risperidone. The primary efficacy measures were response latencies to visually presented stimuli requiring two different types of attention-controlled processing, i.e., focused and divided attention.
About half of the clinical responders did not produce valid performance measures. These could be shown to be of younger mental age and less adaptive as measured by the Vineland Behavior Scales. For the valid task performers divided attention (serial search in working memory) was shown to regress in the placebo group (n = 7), while in the risperidone group (n = 7) there was further improvement. No such group difference was found for focused attention.
The study suggests a beneficial effect of risperidone after several months of treatment, enhancing divided attention in children with pervasive developmental disorders.
We describe two elderly men with preexisting coronary heart disease (CHD) and prostatic carcinoma who presented with intractable anemia due to radiation-induced rectal telangiectases and bleeding. Remission of the bleeding was achieved in both patients by treatment with an estrogen-progestin preparation. However, aggravation of the CHD occurred in both patients. We believe that estrogen-progestin preparations have a potential in the treatment of men with radiation-induced rectal telangiectases, but additional studies are needed to evaluate their long-term effects and optimal dose.
Early intervention in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) appears promising and may represent a window of opportunity for more effective treatment. Whereas the safety and efficacy of risperidone have been established for children aged 5 and older, they has not been adequately tested in preschool children.
A randomized placebo-controlled study of risperidone in preschool children was conducted in a sample of young children, most of whom were also undergoing intensive behavioral treatment.
Preschool children tolerated low-dose risperidone well with no serious adverse effects observed over a 6-month treatment period. Weight gain and hypersalivation were the most common side effects reported, and hyperprolactinemia without lactation or related signs was observed. Significant differences between groups found at baseline complicated the analyses; however, controlling for some of these differences revealed that preschoolers on risperidone demonstrated greater improvements in autism severity. The change in autism severity scores from baseline to 6-month follow up for the risperidone group was 8% compared to 3% for the placebo group. Notably, both groups significantly improved over the 6-month treatment period.
Study findings suggest that risperidone is well tolerated in preschoolers over a 6-month period, but that only minimally greater improvement in target symptoms was evident in the risperidone group, possibly due to the differences between groups at baseline or due to the small sample size. Although these findings are not sufficient to direct treatment, they suggest that larger-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigations of risperidone in preschoolers with ASDs should now be conducted.
