The hemolytic-uremic syndrome consists of the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. The common form of the syndrome is triggered by infection with Shiga toxin-producing bacteria and has a favorable outcome. The less common form of the syndrome, called atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, accounts for about 10% of cases, and patients with this form of the syndrome have a poor prognosis. Approximately half of the patients with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome have mutations in genes that regulate the complement system. Genetic factors in the remaining cases are unknown. We studied the role of thrombomodulin, an endothelial glycoprotein with anticoagulant, antiinflammatory, and cytoprotective properties, in atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
We sequenced the entire thrombomodulin gene (THBD) in 152 patients with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome and in 380 controls. Using purified proteins and cell-expression systems, we investigated whether thrombomodulin regulates the complement system, and we characterized the mechanisms. We evaluated the effects of thrombomodulin missense mutations associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome on complement activation by expressing thrombomodulin variants in cultured cells.
Of 152 patients with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, 7 unrelated patients had six different heterozygous missense THBD mutations. In vitro, thrombomodulin binds to C3b and factor H (CFH) and negatively regulates complement by accelerating factor I-mediated inactivation of C3b in the presence of cofactors, CFH or C4b binding protein. By promoting activation of the plasma procarboxypeptidase B, thrombomodulin also accelerates the inactivation of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Cultured cells expressing thrombomodulin variants associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome had diminished capacity to inactivate C3b and to activate procarboxypeptidase B and were thus less protected from activated complement.
Mutations that impair the function of thrombomodulin occur in about 5% of patients with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
The combination therapy of antiviral peg-interferon and ribavirin has evolved as one of the better treatments for hepatitis C. In spite of its success in controlling hepatitis C infection, it has also been associated with treatment-related adverse side effects. The most common and life threatening among them is hemolytic anemia, necessitating dose reduction or therapy cessation. The presence of this side effect leads to a trade-off between continuing the treatment and exacerbating the side effects versus decreasing dosage to relieve severe side effects while allowing the disease to progress. The drug epoietin (epoetin) is often administered to stimulate the production of red blood cells (RBC) in the bone marrow, in order to allow treatment without anemia. This paper uses mathematical models to study the effect of combination therapy in light of anemia. In order to achieve this we introduce RBC concentration and amount of drug in the body as state variables in the usual immunological virus infection model. Analysis of this model provides a quantification of the amount of drug a body can tolerate without succumbing to hemolytic anemia. Indirect estimation of parameters allow us to calculate the necessary increment in RBC production to be > or =2.3 times the patient's original RBC production rate to sustain the entire course of treatment without encountering anemia in a sensitive patient.
We successfully treated a child with parkinsonism secondary to cytosine arabinoside with levodopa/carbidopa and attempted to elucidate the pathogenesis of the disorder by sequential analysis of cerebrospinal fluid biogenic amines, sequential magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorodopa positron emission tomography, which revealed both permanent and reversible biochemical and structural alterations. The parkinsonian disorder resolved in 9 months. Metabolic changes and structural abnormalities on imaging studies were chronologically correlated with the clinical course.
Chronic renal failure was induced in 10 Wistar rats using a lithium-containing (40 mmol/kg) diet from time of birth until an age of 55-65 weeks. Nine Wistar rats served as controls. The plasma lithium, the plasma urea, and the inulin clearance were measured, and one kidney was fixed by vascular perfusion with glutaraldehyde. The number of glomeruli was estimated stereologically by the fractionator method. The total number of glomeruli per kidney was 23.9 x 10(3) +/- 3.65 x 10(3) (+/- SD) in controls and 22.0 x 10(3) +/- 1.48 x 10(3) in the lithium-treated group, showing no statistically significant difference. The mean glomerular volume was also estimated using stereological methods. The number-weighted mean volume was reduced by 42% in the lithium-treated group, whereas the volume-weighted mean volume was unchanged. This can be attributed to the occurrence of many small glomeruli and a few very large glomeruli in the lithium-treated group. The many small glomeruli have in a previous study been shown to be atubular. The present study showed that the glomerular population is quite resistant to the deleterious effect of lithium; thus glomerular atrophy was seen, but no loss of glomeruli occurred.
(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major polyphenol in green tea, was shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity. In this study, we examined the antimetastatic effects of EGCG or the combination of EGCG and dacarbazine on B16-F3m melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. First, the antimetastatic potentials of five green tea catechins were examined by soft agar colony formation assay, and the results show that EGCG was more effective than the other catechins in inhibiting soft agar colony formation. Second, EGCG dose-dependently inhibited B16-F3m cell migration and invasion by in vitro Transwell assay. Third, EGCG significantly inhibited the spread of B16-F3m cells on fibronectin, laminin, collagen, and Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, EGCG significantly inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). In animal experiments, EGCG alone reduced lung metastases in mice bearing B16-F3m melanomas. However, a combination of EGCG and dacarbazine was more effective than EGCG alone in reducing the number of pulmonary metastases and primary tumor growths, and increased the survival rate of melanoma-bearing mice. These results demonstrate that combination treatment with EGCG and dacarbazine strongly inhibits melanoma growth and metastasis, and the action mechanisms of EGCG are associated with the inhibition of cell spreading, cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions, MMP-9 and FAK activities.
Gestational trophoblastic neoplasm treated by large dosage of 5-fluorouracil and actinomycin could cause cardiotoxicity. In 6 cases of gestational trophoblastic neoplasms admitted to our hospital from March to December 1993, cardiotoxicity was found to have occurred after chemotherapies in 10/21 courses. There were 2 cases with heart failures, 4 cases with palpitation and 4 cases with feelings of oppression and (or) chest pains. In 7 cases the electrocardiogram (EKG) findings were abnormal (70.0%) and in 5 cases there were increased sera glutamic oxalacetic transaminase enzyme (AST). 90.0% of these complications were brought under control after decreasing the dosages and changing the methods of administration. If the proper managements were not given on time, patient may even expire. So attention should be paid to this complication. It is suggested that attention should be paid to patients' subjective symptoms, and proper surveillance by EKG and serum AST determinations should be conducted to minimize deaths due to chemotherapeutic complications.
We describe two cases where increases in dopaminergic therapy were initiated by the patients due to perceived deterioration in symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Shortly afterwards, both cases also met clinical criteria for pathological gambling. To date, only 29 cases of pathological gambling in patients with Parkinson's disease have been reported. This "pathological gambling disorder" is an addiction-like behavior triggered by excessive dopaminergic drugs and does not respond to standard therapy for pathological gambling. It only responds to an adjustment of Parkinson's disease therapy.
D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor agonist, enhances extinction of conditioned fear responding in rodents and facilitates exposure-based learning in humans with anxiety disorders.
This preliminary study investigates DCS pretreatment on response to cocaine cues in cocaine-dependent subjects.
Ten cocaine-dependent subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg DCS or matching placebo two hours before each of two 1-hour cocaine cue exposure sessions one day apart. HR and craving ratings were obtained before and during cue exposure sessions.
There was a trend towards increased craving to cocaine cues in cocaine-dependent individuals after administration of DCS.
The administration of DCS prior to cue exposure sessions may facilitate response activation.
While facilitation of extinction-based learning by DCS may have therapeutic potential for cocaine dependence, this drug may exhibit a different profile in cocaine-dependent individuals as compared to those with anxiety disorders.
The steatogenic effect on the liver of Rifampicin, a potent inhibitor of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in bacteria, was investigated in male and female rats which received either 200 mg or 400 mg of Rifampicin/kg/24 h for 8 days. The determination of total lipids (TL), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and phospholipids (PL) showed a significant increase of TL, TG and TC in the liver at a dose of 400 mg. There was better reproducibility in the male whose blood TG and PL were significantly decreased. These results showed that fatty liver can be induced by very high doses of Rifampicin in rats. A blockage of the very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) biosynthesis and/or secretion can be expected. As a potent steatogenic toxin, alpha-amanitin, is a strong inhibitor of RNA polymerase II in eukariotic cells, a relationship between the RNA polymerase inhibition induced by both of substances and a subsequent inhibition of the biosynthesis of the protein moiety of lipoproteins can be considered. Nevertheless Rifampicin is at present not considered as an inhibitor in eukariotic cells and it will be of great interest to test such a possibility with the high doses used in these experiments, in further work.
Various mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been linked to susceptibility for both familial and idiopathic late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of MBP and LRRKtide by the LRRK2 G2019S mutant was activated by Mn(2+) in vitro. This enhanced G2019S kinase activity was due to the combination of an increase in kinase and a decrease in ATPase activity by Mn(2+). Compared to 10 mM Mg(2+), 1 mM Mn(2+) reduced ATP K(m) for G2019S from 103 to 1.8 muM and only modestly reduced k(cat) (2.5-fold); as a result, the Mn(2+) increased its k(cat)/K(m) by 22-fold. This change in ATP K(m) was due in large part to an increase in nucleotide affinity. While Mn(2+) also increased ATP affinity and had similar effects on k(cat)/K(m) for LRRK2 WT and R1441C enzymes, it reduced their k(cat) values significantly by 13-17-fold. Consequently, the difference in the kinase activity between G2019S and other LRRK2 variants was enhanced from about 2-fold in Mg(2+) to 10-fold in Mn(2+) at saturating ATP concentrations relative to its K(m). Furthermore, while Mg(2+) yielded optimal V(max) values at Mg(2+) concentration greater than 5 mM, the optimal Mn(2+) concentration for activating LRRK2 catalysis was in the micromolar range with increasing Mn(2+) above 1 mM causing a decrease in enzyme activity. Finally, despite the large but expected differences in IC(50) tested at 100 muM ATP, the apparent K(i) values of a small set of LRRK2 ATP-competitive inhibitors were within 5-fold between Mg(2+)- and Mn(2+)-mediated reactions except AMP-CPP, an ATP analogue.
We have established an improved model of fulminant hepatic failure in dogs. Buthionine sulfoximine is used to inactivate glutathione synthesis, and small increments of acetaminophen are given intravenously to maintain the plasma level at approximately 200 micrograms/ml for 20 hr. This regimen produces severe liver injury along with many of the features seen in humans with acetaminophen poisoning. The first sign of impending liver failure is hypoglycemia. This occurs about 15 hr into the experiment and requires treatment with a continuous infusion of glucose. Between 15 and 20 hr, serum ALT activity begins to rise, indicating the onset of liver necrosis. Over the following 15 to 20 hr ALT activity continues to rise and is accompanied by an increase in bilirubin, a prolongation of the prothrombin time and the development of fetor hepaticus. Thirty to 48 hr after the initial acetaminophen dose, the animals begin to exhibit symptoms of encephalopathy and progress from lethargy to the inability to maintain posture and then coma, seizures and death. Liver biopsy specimens obtained at several stages throughout the study showed progressive necrosis, ultimately resulting in the complete destruction of zones 2 and 3.
There is considerable interest in selecting the proper drug to preserve the ischemic myocardium, or twilight zone, in a patient with a recent myocardial infarction. Vasodilator therapy with an infusion of nitroprusside or phentolamine has been shown to improve left ventricular function by reducing both preload and afterload. Sublingual nitroglycerin as well as an infusion of nitroglycerin can also alleviate left ventricular failure in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. Similarly, chronic congestive heart failure patients, irrespective of the etiology, improve hemodynamically after an infusion of phentolamine, nitroprusside or hydralazine. Oral nitrates, phentolamine, and hydralazine have also been demonstrated to produce improvement in chronic heart failure patients. Recently data has become available on the effects of phentolamine, nitroglycerin and nitroprusside on cardiac conduction in man. However there is no information on the electrophysiological properties of hydralazine in man. The present study involving 12 human subjects was undertaken to determine what effect intravenously administered hydralazine has on the human conduction system.
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is among the motor complications that arise in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients after a prolonged treatment with L-DOPA. To this day, transcriptome analysis has been performed in a rat model of LID [Neurobiol. Dis., 17 (2004), 219] but information regarding the proteome is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesion rat model of PD treated with saline, L-DOPA or bromocriptine using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS). Rats treated with L-DOPA were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of LID. Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS (LC/MS/MS). Out of these 67 proteins, LID significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta-crystalin, gamma-enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha-2 subunit. Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in LID.
Four new soft anticholinergic agents based on tropyl alpha-phenylcyclopentylacetate, 15a, 15b, 18a, and 18b, were designed and synthesized. Receptor binding studies on the cloned human muscarinic receptors indicated that the new soft anticholinergic agents possessed moderate potency as pKi ranged from 6.7 to 7.6. Mydriatic studies in rabbit eyes revealed that the duration of the action of the new soft anticholinergics (8.5-11.0 h) were shorter than that of atropine (about 24 h) under pharmacodynamic equivalent dose, and one of them, 18a, showed even shorter than that of tropicamide. In addition, after unilateral administration, significant dilation of pupil in the control eyes was observed with tropicamide and atropine but not with soft drugs, suggesting the systemic activity of soft drugs was minimal. With their soft nature, the new soft anticholinergics displayed much shorter protective effect against carbachol-induced bradycardia (about 30 min) than atropine (at least 60 min) in rats. In vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the soft anticholinergics were rapidly hydrolyzed into the corresponding inactive metabolites once they were introduced into the systemic circulation.
The benign, or infection-associated, haemophagocytic syndrome (IAHS) is a rare bone marrow disorder of macrophage cell proliferation diagnosed most commonly in immune compromised patients who develop herpes type viral infections (Risdall et al. 1979). It has also been reported in association with bacterial infections and rarely with mycobacterial infection (Chandra et al. 1975; Mamoharon & Catovsky 1981; Bultmann et al. 1982). Despite being potentially reversible it may produce a life-threatening pancytopenia (Seligman et al. 1972). We report a further case of the haemophagocytic syndrome associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in which thrombocytopenia was the predominant feature. There were unusual features in the clinical presentation and the patient's treatment and recovery were subsequently complicated by rifampicin-induced renal failure.
The milk-alkali syndrome became rare with the advent of modern ulcer therapy with nonabsorbable antacids, histamine2 blockers, and sucralfate. An increased frequency of this syndrome seems likely with the growing popularity of the use of calcium carbonate as an antacid or as calcium supplementation to prevent osteoporosis. We treated five patients who had six episodes of the milk-alkali syndrome; four of these cases were diagnosed between 1990 and 1992. All patients were ingesting massive quantities of calcium and absorbable alkali and were unaware of the toxic effects of these compounds. All patients presented with the triad of hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, and renal failure. All metabolic abnormalities were corrected, and renal function improved with appropriate supportive measures and cessation of calcium and alkali ingestion. In two patients, the renal failure was so severe that dialysis was necessary. In four patients, either the serum amino-terminal parathyroid hormone or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels were appropriately decreased in response to hypercalcemia. The serum carboxy-terminal parathyroid hormone levels were increased because of renal failure. Since both physicians and patients are often unaware of the calcium and alkali content of many nonprescription medicines, the diagnosis of the milk-alkali syndrome, a reversible cause of renal failure, can be missed if a detailed history of such intake is not elicited. Measurement of the serum amino-terminal parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels may help differentiate milk-alkali syndrome from primary hyperparathyroidism.
Three patients who were treated with ketorolac tromethamine (Toradol), an injectable nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for pain management, developed acute renal failure or hyperkalemia or both. These complications were reversible in two cases after discontinuing the drug. Clinical conditions preexisted in each patient that rendered them susceptible to the renal complications of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use. It is well known that caution should be observed while using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients whose renal function may be preserved through prostaglandin-mediated vasodilatory effects. The same cautions apply to ketorolac. Since its major marketed use is as an analgesic and its potent effect on prostaglandin synthesis may not be well recognized, those cautions must be emphasized.
Chlorpromazine (1, 5, and 20 mg/Kg) was injected intravenously to anesthetized and open-chest dogs under artificial respiration. Using right atrial pacing, the heart rate was increased stepwise from intrinsic sinus rate to higher rate where the A-V block first developed. ECG (II) was recorded simultaneously with arterial blood pressure, ventricular monophasic action potentials and left atrial electrogram. In the control, QRS-duration was constant (46.9 +/- 0.8 msec) irrespective of heart rate. After the drug injection, however, the duration increased significantly with increasing heart rate, the effect depending on the injected dosage (r==0.283, P less than 0.1 in 1 mg/Kg; r==0.406, P less than 0.01 in t mg/Kg; r==0.631, P less than 0.001 in 20 mg/Kg). During the drug action, QRS-duration of atrial premature beats was also longer than that of sinus beats, and the lengthening increased with shortening of preceding cycle length. The observed QRS-prolongations were due to neither incomplete ventricular repolarization nor bundle branch block. The mechanism of prolongation was attributed to delayed or time-dependent recovery of ventricular excitability, i.e., slowed removal of inactivation in rapid sodium system in the ventricular muscle fibers.
We compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy of dirithromycin with that of azithromycin in outpatients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis who could be graded into stage III according to Ball's system of stratification. A total of 80 patients was studied. Of these, 40 were treated with dirithromycin as a once-daily dose of 500 mg for 5 days, and 40 with azithromycin as a once-daily dose of 500 mg for 3 days. At post-therapy, treatment success (cure or improvement) was achieved in 36 out of 40 (90%) patients receiving dirithromycin compared with 37 out of 40 (92.5%) in the azithromycin group. At the late post-therapy visit, 34 out of 36 (94.4%) dirithromycin-treated patients were cured as were 33 of 37 (89.2%) azithromycin-treated patients. A small proportion of patients treated with dirithromycin (10%) or with azithromycin (12.5%) suffered mild side effects. Gastrointestinal disorders, including abdominal cramps, nausea, or diarrhea, were common adverse effects. The main pathogens isolated before treatment were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Eradication rates at the end of treatment were 90% (36 out of 40) for the dirithromycin group and 92.5% (37 out of 40) for the azithromycin group. Persistence of H. influenzae isolates was found in 3 out of 11 (27.3%) patients treated with dirithromycin and in 2 out of 9 (22.2%) who had received azithromycin. At the late post-therapy visit, eradication occurred in 34 out of 36 (94.4%) strains in the dirithromycin group and in 33 out of 37 (89.2%) in the azithromycin group. We conclude that dirithromycin and azithromycin appear to be equally effective in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
We investigated the effects of chronic treatment with food containing one of five antidepressants on substance P (SP) content in the rat brain using radioimmunoassay and enzyme-immunoassay. The antidepressants used were imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, amoxapine and mianserin. Following 40 days of treatment, all the antidepressants decreased SP concentrations in the striatum, substantia nigra and amygdala. Only imipramine and desipramine reduced the peptide content in the hippocampus, and only mianserin reduced it in the septum. We further examined the acute effects of antidepressants one hour after a single intraperitoneal administration. Acute imipramine and desipramine treatment reduced SP in the striatum, whereas acute mianserin decreased it in the striatum and substantia nigra. These results demonstrate that all antidepressants on chronic treatment had a common effect, a reduction of SP content in the striatum, substantia nigra and amygdala. This raises the possibility that such a decrease may contribute to the therapeutic action of antidepressants in affective disorders.
The effects of imipramine hydrochloride on blood-pressure were examined in a prospective and a retrospective study. In a prospective study of 44 depressed patients given imipramine in doses to achieve antidepressant plasma-concentrations there was no effect of the drug on lying blood-pressure. When patients then stood up, the drug produced an average fall in systolic pressure of 26 mm Hg (t = 13.6, P less than 0.001) that was consistent over the four weeks of observation. Contrary to expectation, this fall was independent of patients' age, pre-existing heart-disease, or plasma-level of the drug. The best predictor of orthostatic hypotension during treatment was the degree of orthostatic drop in pressure before treatment (r = 0.695, P less than 0.001). In order to establish the clinical significance of this orthostatic drop in pressure, a retrospective study of 148 depressed patients treated with imipramine was conducted. These 148 patients, average age 59 years, received an average dose of 225 mg of imipramine. Almost 20% of them had symptoms usually associated with orthostatic hypotension that were severe enough to interfere with their treatment: over 4% sustained physical injuries. In our experience orthostatic hypotension is the commonest serious cardiovascular side-effect of imipramine.
Neuroblastoma is a malignant solid tumor of children, which derives from the embryonal sympathoadrenal linage. Clinical cases can vary widely from a favorable to an unfavorable prognosis according to the presence of genetic aberrations, such as MYCN amplification. Our cDNA microarray analysis which compared the gene expressions between favorable and unfavorable neuroblastomas showed a high expression of the neuronatin (Nnat) gene in favorable neuroblastomas. Nnat is highly conserved in mammalian species, and its expression appears in nervous systems from the hindbrain to the peripherals during the prenatal periods. The Nnat mRNA expression, investigated in 63 of neuroblastoma samples by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, was found to be significantly higher in the favorable prognosis groups than in the unfavorable groups. Nnat is an imprinted gene, and its expression in IMR32 neuroblastoma cell line was up-regulated by treatment with a demethylating agent. High expressions of Nnat isoforms induced in an IMR32 neuroblastoma cell line changed the cell morphology to the extension of the neural processes, which thus indicated the occurrence of cell differentiation. In conclusion, the high expressions of Nnat were found to be associated with good prognoses in neuroblastoma, which might indicate tumor differentiation, and its suppressions in unfavorable tumors are considered to be under epigenetic control.
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close correlation between nickel exposure and the incidence of lung cancer. Several studies have suggested that nickel contributes to tumor progression of human lung cancer. In this in vitro study, we found that nickel, as nickel chloride, could significantly enhance the invasive potential of human lung cancer cells, accompanied by elevated expression of IL-8, TGF-β, MMP2 and MMP9 in human lung cancer cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that nickel could activate TLR4 signaling in human lung cancer cells. Further studies showed that the TLR4/MyD88 signaling conferred the enhanced invasive potential of human lung cancer cells induced by nickel. Finally, we revealed that the p38MAPK pathway and NF-kB pathway were necessary for the enhanced invasive potential of human lung cancer cells induced by nickel. Our data provide a mechanistic explanation for nickel induced invasion of human lung cancer, and they suggest new strategies for nickel-related lung cancer clinical biotherapies.
Some antiepileptic drugs have been used with success to counteract withdrawal symptoms following chronic use of sedatives, hypnotics or alcohol. We evaluated the potential of levetiracetam (Keppra), a new antiepileptic drug, to prevent benzodiazepine withdrawal in an animal model sensitive to the anxiogenic effect resulting from drug cessation. The effects of levetiracetam (17 and 54 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally (i.p.) were determined on anxiety induced in female NMRI mice by withdrawal from 21 days of chronic administration of chlordiazepoxide. Administration of chlordiazepoxide was i.p. twice daily, in increments of 2 mg/kg, from 10 up to 40 mg/kg. Anxiety was evaluated using an elevated plus-maze test 24-h after chlordiazepoxide withdrawal. Discontinuation of chronic chlordiazepoxide induced a significant anxiogenic profile in the plus-maze test mainly characterised by a decrease in open arm exploration. This effect was dose-dependently prevented by administration of levetiracetam during the withdrawal period. The highest dose tested (54 mg/kg) induced statistically significant effects on all variables recorded but had no effect upon plus-maze exploration in normal mice. This suggests that the observed effects are dependent upon the level of stress or anxiety of the animals. These results support potential efficacy of levetiracetam in the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.
Insulin resistance is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) plays a key role in tissue insulin sensitivity. A common mutation (G972R) of the IRS-1 gene has been shown to impair IRS-1 function, and it has been associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and lipid abnormalities. This led us to investigate the role of the G972R mutation in predisposing individuals to coronary artery disease (CAD). The DNA of 318 subjects with angiographically documented coronary atherosclerosis (>50% stenosis) and 208 population control subjects was analyzed for the presence of the G972R mutation. This mutation was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction and BstNI restriction enzyme digestion. The frequency of the G972R mutation was significantly higher among patients with CAD than controls (18. 9% versus 6.8%, respectively; P<0.001). After controlling for other coronary risk factors, the relative risk of CAD associated with the G972R mutation was 2.93 (95% CI 1.30 to 6.60; P<0.02) in the entire cohort. This risk was found to be even higher in the subgroups of obese subjects (odds ratio [OR] 6.97, 95% CI 2.24 to 21.4; P<0.001) and subjects with clinical features of insulin resistance syndrome (OR 27.3, 95% CI 7.19 to 104.0; P<0.001). The IRS-1 gene variant was associated with a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus (14.9% among carriers versus 6.5% among noncarriers; P<0.01) and with a 60% increase of plasma total triglycerides (P<0.001). Also, plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol were significantly (P<0.001) higher among carriers than noncarriers, although to lesser a extent. These effects were independent of CAD status. The G972R mutation in the IRS-1 gene was found to be a significant independent predictor of CAD. Moreover, this mutation greatly increased the risk of CAD in obese subjects and in patients with the cluster of abnormalities of insulin resistance syndrome. Besides the increased frequency of diabetes, carriers showed a more atherogenic lipid profile, suggesting a potential role of the IRS-1 gene in the pathogenesis of lipid abnormalities associated with CAD.
