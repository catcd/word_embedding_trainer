To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moderate dosage naloxone in acute moderate and severe traumatic brain injury.
A randomized double-blind prospective clinical trial was done to compare the differences of naloxone and saline in acute moderate and severe traumatic brain injury. Naloxone or saline placebo was intravenously given for 10 days. We followed up for at least 1 month. The indexes of assessment of prognosis were Glasgow outcome scale, verbal function and motor function.
Forty cases were enrolled in the clinical trial, evenly divided into the naloxone group, and the saline group. On the 10th day after the treatment, Glasgow coma scale, improvement of abnormity of blood pressure, rhythm of the heart and breath in the naloxone group were significantly higher than those in the saline group. The mortalities of the naloxone group and the saline group were 0 and 5% respectively. After the one-month follow-up, Glasgow outcome scale and verbal function in the naloxone group were significantly higher than those in the saline group. In addition, a patient was found with mania possibly caused by naloxone.
Early application of moderate dosage naloxone in acute traumatic brain injury may significantly reduce the mortality rate and improve the recovery of nerve function.
Oxidation of docosahexaenoate phospholipids produces 4-hydroxy-7-oxo-hept-5-eonyl phospholipids (HOHA-PLs) that react with protein lysyl ε-amino residues to generate 2-ω-carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP) derivatives, endogenous factors that induce angiogenesis in the retina and tumors. It seemed likely, but remained unproven, that HOHA-PLs react with ethanolamine phospholipids (EPs) in vivo to generate CEP-EPs. We now show that CEP-EPs are present in human blood at 4.6-fold higher levels in age-related macular degeneration plasma than in normal plasma. We also show that CEP-EPs are pro-angiogenic, inducing tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells by activating Toll-like receptor 2. CEP-EP levels may be a useful biomarker for clinical assessment of AMD risk and CEP-associated tumor progression and a tool for monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
The development of novel alternative testing methods is required to identify the sensitizing capacity of chemicals as a replacement for animal experimentation. We aimed to evaluate in vitro assays as screening tools for detecting skin sensitizers. The murine epidermal keratinocyte cell line HEL-30 was exposed to 16 relevant skin sensitizers and 6 skin irritants. The dose causing 75% cell viability (CV(75)) measured by an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was chosen as a highest dose and three more doses (0.5×, 0.1×, and 0.01× of CV(75)) were tested. As parameters, levels of interleukin 1α (IL-1α), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), IL-6, and IL-18 production were measured using 4 different doses. The accuracy of detecting sensitizers or irritants by IL-1α or MIP-2 alone was exactly same: 75% (12 out of 16) for sensitizers, 83% (5 out of 6) for irritants, and overall 77% (17 out of 22). However, combination of IL-1α and MIP-2 showed better accuracy: 94% (15 out of 16), 67% (4 out of 6), and overall 86% (19 out of 22). IL-6 and IL-18 could not differentiate sensitizers from irritants. This study suggests that the combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α and MIP-2 in murine HEL-30 cells can be a reliable in vitro method for identifying chemicals that may act as skin sensitizers.
The authors report a case of acute nephritis which appears during a treatment with phenindione. The nephropathy described after this medication are now well known. Their manifestations are either a proteinuria associated or not with a nephrotic syndrome or an interstitial nephritis whose pronostic is reserved. In this observation the mechanism is different : the lesion is glomerular and complicates an allergic vasculitis which was secondary to the phenindione's therapy. The pronostic was good.
The effects of daily prenatal exposure to 0.0, 0.7, 3.0 and 15.0 mg/kg of the aqueous extract (AQE) of Ipomoea carnea dried leaves on gestational days 5-21 were studied in rat pups and adult offspring. The physical and reflex developmental parameters, open-field, plus-maze, social interaction, forced swimming, catalepsy and stereotyped behaviors, as well as striatal, cortical and hypothalamic monoamine levels (at 140 days of age) were measured. Maternal and offspring body weights were unaffected by exposure to the different doses of the AQE. High postnatal mortality, smaller size at Day 1 of life, reversible hyperflexion of the carpal joints and delay in the opening of both ears and in negative geotaxis were observed in the offspring exposed to the higher dose of AQE. At 60 and 90 days of age, open-field locomotion frequency was quite different between 0.0 and animals treated with 0.7 and 3.0 mg/kg AQE. No changes were observed in the plus-maze, social interaction, forced swimming, catalepsy, stereotyped behavior and central nervous system monoamines concentrations. Dams treated with the higher AQE dose showed severe cytoplasmic vacuolation in liver, kidney, pancreas and thyroid tissues, in contrast to the mild vacuolation observed in the other experimental groups. No alterations were observed in the histopathological study of the offspring of all experimental groups at 140 days of age. During adulthood, behavior was not modified in offspring exposed to the higher dose of AQE as well as no changes occurred in central nervous system neurotransmitters. The present data show that the offspring development alterations were not severe enough to produce behavioral and central monoamine level changes.
Previous reports have suggested that pain associated with the injection of lidocaine is related to the acidic pH of the solution. To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of lidocaine into the physiologic range would reduce pain during injection, we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of pain after receiving standard lidocaine in one femoral area and buffered lidocaine in the opposite femoral area. The mean pain score for buffered lidocaine was significantly lower than the mean score for standard lidocaine (2.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 2.2, P = 0.03). The pH adjustment of standard lidocaine can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the pain occurring during the infiltration of tissues.
From literature data and their own experience, the authors comment hematological complications, related to the use of D-penicillamine, mainly in theumatoïd arthritis. Hypereosinophilia is more common than thrombopenia, but, both complications are usually benign. Anemia alone is very rare. Leukopenia appears in 6% of treated patients, but pancytopenia is rare. Leukopenia and pancytopenia are the most severe complications, even fatal in some cases. The safest dose of D-penicillamine seems to be between 600 and 900 mg per day, provided that, however, regular hematological controls may be achieved.
This study was designed to determine whether (1) P2Y12 antagonism synergizes with other antithrombotics and (2) anticoagulants (thrombin inhibitors) affect the antithrombotic activity elicited by P2Y12 antagonism.
Thrombosis was achieved by perfusion of human and murine blood through type III collagen-coated capillaries at arterial shear rate. CT50547, a direct-acting P2Y12 antagonist, inhibited thrombosis in PPACK- but not heparin-anticoagulated human blood. In contrast, CT50547 inhibited thrombosis in aspirin-treated individuals independently of the anticoagulant. Thrombin and TXA2 also synergized with P2Y12 in the absence of anticoagulation, because combined treatment of aspirin or C921-78 (a factor Xa inhibitor) with CT50547 or 2-MeSAMP (a P2Y12 antagonist) inhibited the thrombotic process, whereas all treatments failed to inhibit thrombosis when used individually. Synergism was also observed ex vivo when P2Y12-deficient (P2Y12-/-) mice were administered aspirin or coagulation inhibitors (C921-78 and bivalirudin). Finally, using intravital microscopy, we found that both C921-78 and bivalirudin abrogated the thrombotic process in P2Y12+/- mice, whereas each showed only partial efficacy in P2Y12+/+ animals.
Our study indicates that (1) thrombin inhibitors and aspirin have a demonstrable synergy of antithrombotic activity with P2Y12 antagonism and (2) the in vitro analysis of the antithrombotic activity of P2Y12 antagonists is affected by the anticoagulant used for blood collection. This suggests that the antithrombotic potential of P2Y12 antagonists in vitro may be overestimated in anticoagulated samples of blood and best achieved in vivo by the inclusion of aspirin and/or a thrombin inhibitor.
Sumatriptan succinate, a serotonin-1 (5-hydroxytryptamine-1) receptor agonist, is an antimigraine drug that is reported to act by selectively constricting intracranial arteries. Recently, vasopressor responses that are distinct from the cranial circulation have been demonstrated to occur in the systemic, pulmonary, and coronary circulations. Cases have been published of coronary vasospasm, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction occurring after sumatriptan use. We report on the development of 8 serious cases of ischemic colitis in patients with migraine treated with sumatriptan.
beta-Blockers improve survival and reduce hospitalization in chronic heart failure (CHF) by biologically improving left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, a good predictor of improvement with this therapy has not been identified. This substudy of BEST examined whether myocardial contractile reserve, as determined by dobutamine stress echocardiography, predicts improvement in LVEF.
Seventy-nine patients with class III/IV CHF underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography before treatment with bucindolol (n=41) or placebo (n=38). Regional wall motion score index (WMSI) was calculated as the sum of the scores in each segment divided by the total number of segments visualized. WMSI was compared with change in LVEF after 3 months of therapy as determined by gated radionuclide scan. Change in WMSI correlated inversely with change in LVEF after 3 months of bucindolol (r=-0.72, P<0.0001) and was the most significant multivariate predictor of change in LVEF (P=0.0002). Patients with contractile reserve had demographics similar to those of patients without contractile reserve, including RVEF, LVEF, systolic blood pressure, and CHF duration. However, patients without contractile reserve had higher baseline plasma norepinephrine levels (687+/-333 versus 420+/-246 pg/mL, P<0.05) and greater decrease in plasma norepinephrine in response to bucindolol (-249+/-171 versus -35+/-277 pg/mL, P<0.05).
This study suggests a direct relationship between contractile reserve and improvement in LVEF with beta-blocker therapy in patients with advanced CHF. Patients without contractile reserve have higher resting adrenergic drive, as reflected by plasma norepinephrine, and may experience greater sympatholytic effects from bucindolol.
We show that mitogenic cells expressing T-type Ca(2+) channels (T-channels) are more sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of the drugs pimozide and mibefradil than cells without significant T-channel expression. The growth of Y79 and WERI-Rb1 retinoblastoma cells, as well as MCF7 breast cancer epithelial cells, all of which express T-channel current and mRNA for T-channel subunits, is inhibited by pimozide and mibefradil with IC(50) values between 0.6 and 1.5 microM. Proliferation of glioma C6 cells, which show little T-channel expression, is less sensitive to these drugs (IC(50) = 8 and 5 microM for pimozide and mibefradil, respectively). Neither drug seems to alter cell cycle or the expression of cyclins. Although this strong correlation between T-channel expression and growth inhibition exists, the following results suggest that the drugs inhibit cell growth via different cytotoxic pathways: 1) pimozide and mibefradil have additive effects on T-channel current inhibition, whereas the antiproliferative activity of the drugs together is synergistic; 2) an increase in the number of apoptotic Y79 and MCF7 cells and a decrease in the mRNA for the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 is detected only in pimozide-treated cells, whereas in mibefradil-treated cells, the toxicity is primarily necrotic; and 3) growth inhibition by mibefradil is reduced in Y79 cells transfected with T-channel antisense and in differentiated Y79 cells (which have decreased T-channel expression), but growth inhibition by pimozide is affected to a lesser extent. These results suggest that pimozide and mibefradil inhibit cell proliferation via different cytotoxic pathways and that in the case of pimozide, it is unlikely that this effect is mediated solely by T-channel inhibition.
Up-regulation of heme oxygenase (HO-1) by either cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) or human gene transfer improves vascular and renal function by several mechanisms, including increases in antioxidant levels and decreases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vascular and renal tissue. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of HO-1 overexpression on mitochondrial transporters, cytochrome c oxidase, and anti-apoptotic proteins in diabetic rats (streptozotocin, (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes). Renal mitochondrial carnitine, deoxynucleotide, and ADP/ATP carriers were significantly reduced in diabetic compared with nondiabetic rats (p < 0.05). The citrate carrier was not significantly decreased in diabetic tissue. CoPP administration produced a robust increase in carnitine, citrate, deoxynucleotide, dicarboxylate, and ADP/ATP carriers and no significant change in oxoglutarate and aspartate/glutamate carriers. The increase in mitochondrial carriers (MCs) was associated with a significant increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity. The administration of tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP), an inhibitor of HO-1 activity, prevented the restoration of MCs in diabetic rats. Human HO-1 cDNA transfer into diabetic rats increased both HO-1 protein and activity, and restored mitochondrial ADP/ATP and deoxynucleotide carriers. The increase in HO-1 by CoPP administration was associated with a significant increase in the phosphorylation of AKT and levels of BcL-XL proteins. These observations in experimental diabetes suggest that the cytoprotective mechanism of HO-1 against oxidative stress involves an increase in the levels of MCs and anti-apoptotic proteins as well as in cytochrome c oxidase activity.
The efficacy of temozolomide strongly depends on O(6)-alkylguanine DNA-alkyl transferase (AGAT), which repairs DNA damage caused by the drug itself. Low-dose protracted temozolomide administration can decrease AGAT activity. The main end point of the present study was therefore to test progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) in glioblastoma patients following a prolonged temozolomide schedule. Chemonaïve glioblastoma patients with disease recurrence or progression after surgery and standard radiotherapy were considered eligible. Chemotherapy cycles consisted of temozolomide 75 mg/m(2)/daily for 21 days every 28 days until disease progression. O(6)-methyl-guanine-DNA-methyl-tranferase (MGMT) was determined in 22 patients (66.7%). A total of 33 patients (median age 57 years, range 31-71) with a median KPS of 90 (range 60-100) were accrued. The overall response rate was 9%, and PFS-6 30.3% (95% CI:18-51%). No correlation was found between the MGMT promoter methylation status of the tumours and the overall response rate, time to progression and survival. In 153 treatment cycles delivered, the most common grade 3/4 event was lymphopoenia. The prolonged temozolomide schedule considered in the present study is followed by a high PFS-6 rate; toxicity is acceptable. Further randomised trials should therefore be conducted to confirm the efficacy of this regimen.
Although liver injury after administration of the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination is rare, hepatocellular necrosis and cholestasis have developed in a few cases. We describe a patient who developed a severe, prolonged cholestatic reaction after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration. The findings from serial liver biopsy samples showed characteristic abnormalities of phospholipidosis that have not been previously described for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-related hepatic injury. The most prominent finding on electron microscopic evaluation of the liver was the presence of prominent hepatocyte lysosomal inclusions characterized by concentric arrangements of membranous and lamellated structures. The patient improved after several courses of exchange plasmapheresis, which may have assisted in the removal of toxic drug-lipid complexes. The pathogenesis of this acquired secondary phospholipidosis is unknown. Possible mechanisms include generation of highly lipid-soluble metabolites and inhibition of the lysosomal enzyme phospholipase A1.
Transient neurological symptoms have been reported after hyperbaric lidocaine 5% spinal anaesthetics. We report a patient with neurogenic back and leg pain after uncomplicated bupivacaine and morphine spinal anaesthesia. A healthy 39-yr-old woman received 1.6 ml hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.75% and 250 micrograms morphine intrathecally. Two hours later, the patient experienced discomfort during suturing of the peritoneum and surgery was completed under general anaesthesia. Recovery was uncomplicated until 13 hr after intrathecal injection, when the patient complained of burning pain in her back extending to the front of the abdomen and similar pain in her thighs. Neurological consultation was obtained. Treatment was started with amitriptyline and the symptoms resolved slowly. Complete recovery occurred over three months. Further studies to assess symptoms after spinal anaesthesia are indicated.
The receptor tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) signaling pathway, mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met)/hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), has been implicated in oncogenesis and is a target of interest in cancer therapy. PF-04254644 is a potent and selective inhibitor of c-Met/HGFR. Wide ligand binding profiling of PF-04254644 revealed a potentially significant interaction with phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3, and follow-up PDE enzyme activity assays confirmed PF-04254644 as a potent inhibitor of PDE3 as well as other PDEs (1, 2, 5, 10, and 11). Clinical observations, laboratory, and echocardiography parameters were recorded in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that received PF-04254644 oral dosing for up to seven consecutive days. Toxicological evaluations revealed myocardial degeneration as an adverse event at all tested doses. Echocardiographic evaluations revealed an increase in heart rate (HR) and contractility after the first dose with PF-04254644 and myocardial fibrosis correlated with decreased cardiac function after repeat dosing. A study in telemetry-instrumented rats substantiated that PF-04254644 induced a sustained increased HR and decreased contractility after six days of treatment. Data suggest that the decreased cardiac function and cardiotoxicity are likely due to inhibition of multiple PDEs by PF-04254644.
We sought to investigate the vascular mechanisms of dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.
Dobutamine stress is often used as a surrogate for exercise. The effects of dobutamine on the epicardial arteries are incompletely understood and possibly different from those of physical exercise.
Intravenous (IV) dobutamine (40 microg/kg per min) was administered in 19 patients with normal, 23 patients with mildly atherosclerotic, and 12 patients with stenotic coronary arteries. In another two groups of patients with stenotic arteries, IV dobutamine was preceded by 1) an intracoronary (IC) bolus of the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine (12 microg/kg, n = 12); and 2) an IC infusion of the nitric oxide substrate L-arginine (150 micromol/l per min for 20 min, n = 11). Intravenous saline instead of dobutamine was infused into eight patients with normal arteries. After dobutamine (or saline), an IC bolus of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, 0.2 mg) was given. Coronary vasomotion was evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography on angiograms obtained after each dose of dobutamine, saline, phentolamine, L-arginine, and ISDN.
Dobutamine increased the rate-pressure product and heart rate similarly in all patients except those who received saline. Dobutamine induced vasodilation in normal (change in luminal diameter [DeltaLD] vs. baseline: 19 +/- 2%) and in mildly atherosclerotic arteries (DeltaLD: 8 +/- 2%, p < 0.05 vs. normal). In stenotic arteries, dobutamine did not induce significant vasomotion (DeltaLD: -3 +/- 3%); the latter was improved by L-arginine (DeltaLD: 10 +/- 3%, p < 0.05 vs. stenotic arteries) and fully restored by phentolamine (DeltaLD: 19 +/- 3%, p < 0.05 vs. stenotic arteries).
Endothelial dysfunction and enhanced alpha-adrenergic tone contribute to the loss of dobutamine-induced vasodilation in coronary atherosclerosis. In contrast to physical exercise, dobutamine does not induce "paradoxical vasoconstriction" of atherosclerotic coronary arteries.
Multiple avenues of research have provided evidence for the role of genetic and environmental factors in epilepsy. Previous studies indicated an association of debrisoquine hydroxylase (CYP2D6) with susceptibility to epilepsy. In this study, association of CYP2D6 100C > T and 2850C > T polymorphisms with generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) among Indians has been analysed using case-control approach. A significant association of 2850C > T (P = 0.015) has been observed. Comparison between phenytoin toxic and others among patients showed no association of these polymorphisms with phenytoin toxicity.
Experimental evidence suggests that aldosterone may contribute to progressive kidney disease. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists (ARBs) suppress the renin-angiotensin system, these agents do not adequately control plasma aldosterone levels. Hence, administration of aldosterone receptor antagonists may provide additional renal benefits to the ACE inhibitors and ARBs.
In the present uncontrolled pilot study, we evaluate the short-term (8 weeks) effects of spironolactone on proteinuria in 42 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) already treated with ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs.
Spironolactone (25 mg/d for 8 weeks) decreased proteinuria from protein of 2.09 +/- 0.16 to 1.32 +/- 0.08 g/24 h after 2 weeks and 1.05 +/- 0.08 g/24 h after 8 weeks. Four weeks after discontinuation of spironolactone therapy, proteinuria returned to close to baseline values. Baseline proteinuria correlated significantly with plasma aldosterone level (r = 0.81; P < 0.0001). Moreover, baseline aldosterone level correlated significantly with degree of reduction in proteinuria after treatment with spironolactone (r = 0.70; P < 0.0001). Spironolactone caused a significant increase in serum potassium levels (from 4.4 +/- 0.1 mEq/L [mmol/L] at baseline to 4.8 +/- 0.1 mEq/L [mmol/L] after 8 weeks of treatment; P < 0.01).
This study shows that spironolactone may effectively reduce proteinuria in patients with CKD. Concerns remain in regard to the risk for hyperkalemia in patients with CKD. Prospective randomized trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of antagonists of aldosterone on proteinuria and progression of CKD.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the bilateral degeneration of the midbrain dopamine-containing neurons with the most severe lesion in the posterolateral part of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). In humans, such lesions lead to specific motor abnormalities (i.e., akinesia, rigidity, and tremor) that are greatly improved by levodopa treatment. After a few years, the beneficial effect of the treatment is frequently offset by the development of dyskinesias. To improve treatment strategies, an animal model showing most of the histological and clinical characteristics of the human disease is mandatory. Ten rats received a bilateral injection of small doses of 6-OHDA in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) and were compared with five sham-lesioned rats. The 6-OHDA-lesioned rats progressively developed abnormal motor behavior (assessed by the stepping test) compared with the sham-lesioned rats. The lesioned rats greatly improved under levodopa treatment, but developed concomitant dyskinesias. All 6-OHDA-lesioned animals had bilateral partial lesions of the SNpc, with the most severe lesion being in its posterolateral part. There was a significant correlation between the severity of the dopaminergic cell loss and the severity of the levodopa-induced dyskinesias. These rats constitute an interesting model of PD, sharing some of the main characteristics of the human disease.
The stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (p38-MAPK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase [JNK-1 and JNK-2], and extracellular signal regulated kinases [ERK-1 and ERK-2]) might be involved in angiotensin II (AII)-induced ischemia-reperfusion injury. Cardioprotection induced by AII type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptor blockade during ischemia-reperfusion is associated with protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon), nitric oxide, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling. Our aim was to assess the effect of selective AT1 and AT2 receptor blockade with losartan and PD123,319, respectively, on MAPK expression after ischemia-reperfusion in isolated working rat hearts.
Groups of six hearts were subjected to global ischemia (30 minutes) followed by reperfusion (30 minutes) and exposed to no drug/no ischemia-reperfusion (control), ischemia-reperfusion/no drug, and ischemia-reperfusion with losartan (1 microM), or PD123,319 (0.3 microM) and additional groups. AT1/AT2 receptor expression, MAPKs, PKCepsilon, and cGMP, and changes in mechanical function were measured. Western blotting was done on left ventricular tissue for AT1/AT2, p38/phosphorylated-p38 (p-p38), phosphorylated (p)-JNK-1/-2, phosphorylated (p)-ERK-1/-2, and PKCepsilon proteins; Northern blots for AT1/AT2 mRNA; and enzyme immunoassay for cGMP.
Compared with controls, ischemia-reperfusion induced significant left ventricular dysfunction, decreased AT2 protein and mRNA, increased p-p38 and p-JNK-1/-2, did not change p-ERK-1/-2 or PKCepsilon, and decreased cGMP. PD123,319 improved left ventricular recovery after ischemia-reperfusion, increased AT2 protein and mRNA, mildly increased p-p38, normalized p-JNK-1, did not change p-ERK-1/-2, and increased PKCepsilon and cGMP. Losartan did not change p-p38, increased p-JNK-1, and did not change pERK-1/-2, PKCepsilon, or cGMP.
The overall results suggest that the activation of p38-MAPK and JNK might be linked to AII signaling and play a significant role in acute ischemia-reperfusion injury as well as in the cardioprotective effect of AT2 receptor blockade.
A compilation of drug interactions between H2 antagonists and cardiovascular drugs is found in Table I. Cimetidine's potency, lipophilicity, and affinity for binding to the P-450 cytochrome system can probably be attributed to the drug interactions that have been identified with the H2 antagonists. The mechanism for most cimetidine drug interactions is inhibition of hepatic metabolism. There is conflicting evidence regarding significance of altered liver blood flow for both cimetidine and ranitidine and their influence on other agents. Cimetidine may increase propranolol's blood concentrations and potentiate beta blocking effects through inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes and possibly through reduction of hepatic blood flow. Ranitidine has no effect on propranolol. Cimetidine, when administered concurrently with metoprolol, could possibly cause an increase in plasma metoprolol concentrations or bioavailability through inhibition of hepatic P-450 metabolizing enzymes. No effect of cimetidine on metoprolol pharmacodynamics was evident. Ranitidine has no effect on metoprolol pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Neither H2 antagonist altered the kinetics or physiologic effects of atenolol. Atenolol is the drug of choice in patients receiving H2 antagonists, since no interaction has been observed. Metoprolol could probably be used safely in most patients, as no change in pharmacodynamics has been evident. Concurrent administration of cimetidine and nifedipine may result in alterations in heart rate and blood pressure. The mechanism is inhibition of oxidative liver metabolism. Ranitidine has no effect on nifedipine. Studies are needed to investigate the interaction between the H2 antagonists and diltiazem or verapamil. Cimetidine, given concomitantly with lidocaine, may increase lidocaine concentrations and clinical symptoms of lidocaine toxicity. The mechanism involved is probably a reduction in oxidative drug metabolism or liver blood flow. Ranitidine has no significant effects on lidocaine pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine may increase quinidine levels and symptoms of quinidine toxicity. Additionally, enhanced arrhythmic effects may be observed. The interaction probably caused by an inhibition of hepatic drug metabolism of quinidine by cimetidine would be most significant in patients with liver disease and in the elderly. Ranitidine may enhance quinidine's arrhythmic effect. Cimetidine can possibly increase procainamide and NAPA serum concentrations, especially in the elderly and in patients with renal dysfunction, predisposing them to adverse side effects. The interaction is mediated by a reduction of tubular secretion of procainamide and NAPA.
