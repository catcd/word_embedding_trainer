Long-term exposure to cadmium (Cd) causes renal dysfunction, but the change in renal function with exposure is unknown. We assessed the evolution of Cd-induced renal effects after a reduction in dietary exposure to Cd in rice.
Four hundred twelve residents in previously Cd-polluted and nonpolluted areas were examined twice, in 1998 and in 2006. Changes in blood Cd, urinary Cd, and kidney function [N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG), β2-microglobulin, and albumin in urine] were measured.
In the most polluted area, mean blood Cd was 8.9 μg/L and 3.3 μg/L in 1998 and in 2006, respectively, and urinary Cd was 11.6 and 9.0 μg/g creatinine. Urinary albumin in 1998 increased with urinary Cd, but no such exposure-response relation appeared for 2006 albumin versus urinary Cd 1998, indicating recovery. Other biomarkers of kidney function were also elevated in 1998. Partial recovery was observed for NAG among women and was suggested for β2-microglobulin among young individuals. The probability of having β2-microglobulin levels above the 95th percentile in 2006 was high in those with elevated β2-microglobulin in 1998 [odds ratio (OR) = 24.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 11.2, 55.3] compared with albumin (OR = 3.0; 95% CI: 1.2, 7.5) and NAG (OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.6, 4.4).
Results suggest that a Cd-mediated increase in urinary albumin excretion is reversible upon substantial reduction of exposure. For markers of tubular effects, we observed a tendency toward improvement but not complete recovery. Data from repeated observations suggest that β2-microglobulin may be more informative than NAG as an indicator for an individual's future tubular function.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole as acute and maintenance of effect monotherapy for acute bipolar mania.
Patients with acute bipolar I mania (DSM-IV-TR: YMRS > or =20), manic or mixed (with or without psychotic features) were randomized to double-blind aripiprazole (15-30 mg/day; n=155), placebo (n=165) or lithium (900-1500 mg/day; n=160) (1:1:1) for 3 weeks. Aripiprazole- and lithium-treated patients remained on blinded treatment for 9 additional weeks. The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in YMRS Total score (LOCF) to Week 3. Secondary outcomes included the mean change from baseline in YMRS Total score (LOCF) at all other timepoints up to Week 12.
Aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater improvement than placebo in mean YMRS Total score from baseline to Day 2 (-4.3 vs.-2.8; p=0.003), and up to Week 3 (-12.6 vs. -9.0; p<0.001). Significant improvement in YMRS Total score was also seen with lithium versus placebo at Week 3 (-12.0 vs. -9.0; p=0.005). Improvements in YMRS Total score were maintained to Week 12 for aripiprazole (-14.5) and lithium (-12.7). Response rates at Week 3 were significantly higher with aripiprazole (46.8%) and lithium (45.8%) than placebo (34.4%; both p<0.05, LOCF); increasing to Week 12 with aripiprazole (56.5%) and lithium (49.0%). Most common adverse events with aripiprazole were headache, nausea, akathisia, sedation, and constipation; with lithium were nausea, headache, constipation, and tremor.
Aripiprazole provided statistically significant improvement of acute mania within 2 days, continuing over 3 weeks and sustained over 12 weeks. The magnitude of improvement to Week 12 was similar with aripiprazole and lithium.
Anecdotal reports have suggested that cardiovascular complications may occur if thrombolytic therapy is performed in cases of pericarditis misdiagnosed as acute myocardial infarction. From 1980 to 1993, 47 cases of myopericarditis mimicking myocardial infarction have been admitted to our institution. The misdiagnosis was made because of clinical onset characterized by a typical chest pain, and/or localized ST segment elevation. Since 1987, nine (9/9 males, age 40 +/- 14 years) out of the 47 patients (19%) have been treated with a thrombolytic agent (streptokinase 4/9, rt-PA 5/9) followed by intravenous heparin. This treatment was started during the pre-hospital phase (2/9) and while in hospital (7/9). No pericardial rub was present; ST segment elevation was mainly localized in inferior and lateral leads; no Q wave developed; median creatine kinase rise was 268 units (range 38 to 1280), and only one patient had a small pericardial effusion. The mean level of fibrinogen after thrombolysis was 1.72 g.l-1 (range 0.10 to 4.50). In all cases, typical ECG changes were present suggesting pericarditis with a subsequent return to a normal ECG. No severe cardiac or pericardial complication or arrhythmia occurred; only one patient developed a non-compressive and resolvable pericardial effusion. Cardiac catheterizations (coronary and left ventricular angiographies) were normal when performed (5/9). Long-term follow-up (mean 46 +/- 29 months) was favourable without any coronary events. In conclusion, thrombolytic therapy was uncomplicated in our patients with myopericarditis simulating evolving myocardial infarction.
Tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as imipramine and desipramine have long been known to produce cardiovascular side effects including sinus tachycardia, prolongation of the P-R, QRS, and Q-T intervals, and decreased T-wave amplitude. Life-threatening ventricular ectopic activity has occurred after tricyclic drug overdose. Recently, maprotiline (Ludiomil), a tetracyclic anthracene-derivative antidepressant, has become available for the treatment of affective disorders. It appears as effective as the tricyclic drugs in relieving unipolar depression. Although several studies have reported a low incidence of cardiovascular side effects, others show little difference between the tetracyclic and tricyclic drugs. This report describes a patient in whom maprotiline treatment caused Q-T prolongation and life-threatening torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (VT).
A 19-year-old man with systemic sclerosis (SSc) was hospitalized for autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) due to progressive scleroderma and cardiac involvement despite conventional treatment. During the administration of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day for 2 days) for mobilization and collection of CD34+ selected peripheral blood stem cells, he developed congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram showed hypokinetic asynergy from the septum to posterior wall, which might indicate underlying cardiac damage. We were also concerned about the risk of high-dose cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity. Since the dose-limiting toxicity of thiotepa, an alkylating agent, is myelosuppression, and cardiac toxicity due to thiotepa is less common, we used a conditioning regimen consisting of thiotepa (10 mg/kg/day, day -5) and low-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day, days -3 and -2), instead of the conventional high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day x 4 days/course). The post-transplant course was uneventful, and the modified Rodnan skin thickness score improved from 32 to 15. The present case report demonstrates that thiotepa can be employed as a conditioning regimen for auto-PBSCT in SSc patients with cardiac involvement in order to reduce cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity.
Four antibacterial diterpenes, trichorabdals A, B, C and H were isolated from the leaves of Rabdosia trichocarpa and the relationship between their conformations analysed by spectroscopic and computational methods. Their antibacterial activity is discussed.
Solid rationales are still present for the identification of synthetic ligands to simultaneously target multiple PPAR subtypes for the treatment of T2DM. The purpose of this study was to characterize the in vitro and in vivo differential effects of chiglitazar, a non-TZD type of PPAR pan-agonist currently in phase III clinic development in China, from PPARγ-selective agonist like rosiglitazone. Chiglitazar showed transactivating activity in each PPARα, γ, and δ subtype and upregulated the expression of PPARα and/or PPARδ downstream genes involved in the key processes of lipid metabolism and thermogenesis. Comparable blood glucose lowering effect was observed between chiglitazar and rosiglitazone, but chiglitazar did not significantly increase the body weight in KKAy and fat pad weight in db/db mice. Chiglitazar had high distribution in liver, pancreas, and skeleton muscles but was less present in kidney, heart, and adipose in rats. Heart weight increase was not observed in rats treated with chiglitazar for 6 months at a dose as high as 45 mg kg(-1). The in vitro and in vivo differential features of chiglitazar are informative and encouraging for the further development of this synthetic ligand for the potential use in T2DM.
To determine the effect of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) on allergic rhinitis.
Allergic rhinitis was induced by toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI). At the end of the treatment, the pathological changes in the nasal mucosa were observed. The concentrations of histamine in the nasal mucosa and IgE in the blood were determined as well.
Symptoms of allergic rhinitis were remarkably relieved after IL-1ra treatment. Hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated that less edema was found in the nasal mucosa and small vessel was normal after IL-1ra application, but edema,vasodilation, and inflammatory cell infiltration were discovered in the model group. The concentrations of histamine in the nasal mucosa and IgE in the blood were less than those in the control group.
IL-1ra im administration selectively and non-traumatically alleviated nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing.
To assess the effect of intravenous cidofovir on delaying progression of previously treated, relapsing cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, we conducted a randomized, controlled comparison of two maintenance dose levels of cidofovir. One hundred and fifty patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis that had progressed or was persistently active despite treatment with ganciclovir, foscarnet, or both were randomized to receive induction cidofovir, 5 mg/kg once weekly for 2 weeks, then maintenance therapy with either 5 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg once every other week. Concomitant probenecid and intravenous hydration were administered with each cidofovir dose. Retinitis progression was assessed in the first 100 patients by bilateral, full-field retinal photographs read at a central reading center by an ophthalmologist masked to treatment assignment. Incidence of side effects, changes in visual acuity, and mortality were also assessed. Median time to retinitis progression as assessed by retinal photography was not reached (95% confidence interval [CI], 115 days-upper limit not reached) in the 5-mg/kg group, and was 49 days (95% CI, 35-52 days) in the 3-mg/kg group (p = .0006). Dose-dependent asymptomatic proteinuria (39%) and serum creatinine elevation (24%) were the most common adverse events thought to be related to cidofovir. Reversible probenecid reactions including constitutional symptoms and nausea occurred in 65 of 150 (43%) patients. Cidofovir therapy is effective in delaying progression of CMV retinitis that had previously progressed using other anti-CMV therapies.
The Guillain-Barré syndrome and pemphigus foliaceus occurred simultaneously in a patient on long-term treatment with D-penicillamine. It is proposed that both conditions may have developed as a result of a disturbance of immunoregulation caused by D-penicillamine.
Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of SNPs associated with predisposition to various diseases, including prostate cancer. However, the mechanistic roles of these SNPs remain poorly defined, particularly for noncoding polymorphisms. Here we find that the prostate cancer risk-associated SNP rs339331 at 6q22 lies within a functional HOXB13-binding site. The risk-associated T allele at rs339331 increases binding of HOXB13 to a transcriptional enhancer, conferring allele-specific upregulation of the rs339331-associated gene RFX6. Suppression of RFX6 diminishes prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Clinical data indicate that RFX6 upregulation in human prostate cancers correlates with tumor progression, metastasis and risk of biochemical relapse. Finally, we observe a significant association between the risk-associated T allele at rs339331 and increased RFX6 mRNA levels in human prostate tumors. Together, our results suggest that rs339331 affects prostate cancer risk by altering RFX6 expression through a functional interaction with the prostate cancer susceptibility gene HOXB13.
Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is densely expressed in medium-sized spiny projection neurons of the rat striatum. Activation of mGluR5 increases intracellular Ca2+, resulting in Ca(2+)-dependent cellular responses. Acute administration of the psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH) induces immediate early gene (IEG) expression in the striatum, which is considered an important molecular event for the development of striatal neuroplasticity related to the addictive properties of drugs of abuse. This study investigated the role of mGluR5 in the mediation of IEG expression in the rat striatum induced by a single dose of AMPH (4 mg/kg, i.p.) in vivo. We found that systemic administration of the mGluR5-selective antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP) at a dose of 10 mg/kg, i.p. reduced AMPH-stimulated c-fos mRNA levels in the dorsal (caudoputamen) and ventral (nucleus accumbens) striatum as revealed by quantitative in situ hybridization. Similar results were observed in the three areas of cerebral cortex (cingulate, sensory, and piriform cortex). In contrast to c-fos mRNAs, AMPH-stimulated mRNA expression of another IEG, zif/268, was not significantly altered by the blockade of mGluR5 with MPEP in the entire striatum and the three areas of cortex. Treatment with MPEP alone had no effect on basal levels of c-fos and zif/268 mRNAs in the striatal and cortical areas. These results indicate that an mGluR5-dependent mechanism selectively contributes to c-fos expression in the striatum and cortex in response to acute exposure to AMPH.
Vitamin therapy to lower homocysteine levels has recently been recommended for the prevention of restenosis after coronary angioplasty. We tested the effect of a combination of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 (referred to as folate therapy) on the risk of angiographic restenosis after coronary-stent placement in a double-blind, multicenter trial.
A total of 636 patients who had undergone successful coronary stenting were randomly assigned to receive 1 mg of folic acid, 5 mg of vitamin B6, and 1 mg of vitamin B12 intravenously, followed by daily oral doses of 1.2 mg of folic acid, 48 mg of vitamin B6, and 60 microg of vitamin B12 for six months, or to receive placebo. The angiographic end points (minimal luminal diameter, late loss, and restenosis rate) were assessed at six months by means of quantitative coronary angiography.
At follow-up, the mean (+/-SD) minimal luminal diameter was significantly smaller in the folate group than in the placebo group (1.59+/-0.62 mm vs. 1.74+/-0.64 mm, P=0.008), and the extent of late luminal loss was greater (0.90+/-0.55 mm vs. 0.76+/-0.58 mm, P=0.004). The restenosis rate was higher in the folate group than in the placebo group (34.5 percent vs. 26.5 percent, P=0.05), and a higher percentage of patients in the folate group required repeated target-vessel revascularization (15.8 percent vs. 10.6 percent, P=0.05). Folate therapy had adverse effects on the risk of restenosis in all subgroups except for women, patients with diabetes, and patients with markedly elevated homocysteine levels (15 micromol per liter or more) at baseline.
Contrary to previous findings, the administration of folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 after coronary stenting may increase the risk of in-stent restenosis and the need for target-vessel revascularization.
Topical glyceryl trinitrate heals anal fissures, but a majority of patients experience headache. Topical gels of the calcium channel blocker diltiazem and the cholinomimetic bethanechol significantly lower anal sphincter pressure in volunteers. This study investigated the use of these two new pharmacologic agents in the treatment of patients with chronic anal fissure.
Two studies were conducted, each involving 15 patients with chronic anal fissure. In each study patients underwent anal manometry and laser doppler flowmetry before treatment. They were treated with either 2 percent diltiazem gel or 0.1 percent bethanechol gel three times daily for eight weeks. Assessment every two weeks was by clinical examination, repeat anal manometry, and laser doppler flowmetry. Daily pain was assessed by linear analog charts.
Fissures healed in 10 of 15 (67 percent) patients treated with 2 percent diltiazem gel and in 9 (60 percent) patients treated with 0.1 percent bethanechol gel. There was no significant difference in the pretreatment maximum resting sphincter pressure (MRP) between responders and nonresponders in either group. There was significant reduction in the pain score after treatment with diltiazem (P = 0.002) and bethanechol (P = 0.005) compared with that before treatment. MRP was significantly lower after diltiazem (P = 0.0001) and bethanechol (P = 0.02) compared with pretreatment MRP. No headaches or side effects were reported.
Both topical diltiazem and bethanechol substantially reduce anal sphincter pressure and achieve fissure healing to a similar degree reported with topical nitrates, but without side effects.
Seven cases of analgesic nephropathy due to excessive ingestion of paracetamol are reported. None of these patients had been taking any other analgesic. All had radiological features of papillary necrosis. With the increasing use of paracetamol as a mild analgesic it is necessary to be aware of the possibility that paracetamol may induce analgesic nephropathy.
Reduced glutathione (GSH) has been reported to be an effective protector against cyclophosphamide-induced urotoxicity in experimental models, providing protection comparable to that of mesna. This paper describes our preliminary results of the clinical use of GSH in combination with cyclophosphamide. GSH was administered i.v. in two divided doses of 2.5 g, 15 min before and 30 min after escalating doses of cyclophosphamide ranging from 1.2 up to 1.6 g/m2 (1-h infusion). GSH was well tolerated and did not produce unexpected toxicity. The lack of bladder damage, including microscopic hematuria, supports the protective role of this thiol compound.
The authors report on seven patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for psychoactive substance (alprazolam) dependence. All had withdrawal symptoms, six demonstrated tolerance, and at least four had substantial social or occupational impairment secondary to drug use. All seven patients had begun taking alprazolam as treatment for anxiety or depression. Six patients abused other drugs or alcohol, either in the past or concurrently. Doses of alprazolam ranged from 2 to 12 mg/day, and duration of use was 6 months to 3 years. The potential for dependence should be considered when prescribing alprazolam.
At least three proteins, COX17p, SCO1p, and its homologue SCO2p are thought to be involved in mitochondrial copper transport to cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain. Recently, we and others have shown that mutations in SCO2 are associated with a lethal infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP) with COX-deficiency. The majority of patients with a similar phenotype were, however, negative for SCO2 mutations, suggesting the other genes as candidates for this disorder. Here we report on the genomic organization of SCO1 and COX17 on human chromosomes 17 and 3 respectively, and the complete sequence analysis of COX17 and SCO1 in 30 patients with COX deficiency. Using a panel of human:mouse-monochromosomal hybrids, the expression of COX17 was specifically restricted to chromosome 3, indicating that the previously reported sequence on chromosome 13 represents a pseudogene. DNA sequence analysis of SCO1 and COX17 in nine patients with severe COX deficiency and fatal HCMP, and in 21 patients with other COX deficiency disorders, did not reveal any pathogenic mutations or polymorphisms. We conclude that neither SCO1 nor COX17 are common causes of COX deficiency disorders.
In 90 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease and sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, who were treated with oral sotalol and underwent programmed stimulation to determine drug effectiveness, the influence of sotalol on induced ventricular tachycardia morphology was retrospectively examined. In 54 patients (60%) sotalol rendered the tachycardia non-inducible. However, contrary to drug-testing with class I antiarrhythmic agents, induction of multiple morphologies at baseline study did not predict failure of subsequent drug-testing with sotalol. In the remaining 36 patients (40%), in whom sotalol did not modify inducibility, 21 patients (i.e. a total of 23%) manifested at least one new morphology during electropharmacological testing on sotalol. This effect was independent of the degree of left ventricular dysfunction, infarct location and numbers of morphologies at baseline, but corresponded with drug-induced changes in refractoriness. This observation may be related to a proarrhythmic effect of sotalol. Slowing of ventricular tachycardia rate and changes in morphology may have implications in patients receiving implantable cardioverter-defibrillators or those undergoing ablative procedures.
Maintenance of haemodynamic stability during anaesthesia for phaeochromocytoma resection is still a challenge. If magnesium sulfate is widely used for the control of arterial pressure during preeclampsia, its use during phaeochromocytoma resection has only been published by one author. We describe two cases where magnesium sulfate is the main agent used to control arterial pressure during resection of a phaeochromocytoma. Magnesium sulfate's hypotensive, antiarrhythmic and antiadrenergic properties are reviewed. The total doses administered were 11 g and 12 g, given as an infusion and boluses. Magnesium sulfate could be part of the anaesthetist's pharmacopoeia during phaeochromocytoma resection.
Prolonged cadmium exposure has been associated with proteinuria, calcuria and loss of calcium from bones in humans. Previous studies have shown that kidney uptake of cadmium in vivo results from proximal tubule absorption of the circulating cadmium metallothionein complex (CdMT), and intracellular release of the Cd2+ ion prior to induction of renal metallothionein. Parenteral administration of CdMT has been found to selectively damage the proximal tubule cell lysosome system with development of a tubular proteinuria pattern similar to that observed under chronic exposure conditions. The present studies also demonstrate a concomitant calcuria but no changes in the excretion of other electrolytes or glucose using this model. These marked changes in renal calcium metabolism occurred in the absence of mitochondrial damage, changes in total, Na/K or Mg-stimulated ATPase activities, renal ATP levels, membrane 45Ca2+ transport or overt tubule cell necrosis during an 8 hour period following CdMT injection. Proteinuria and calcuria were prevented by prior zinc induction of the renal MT pool. Data from these studies indicate that renal proximal tubule cell uptake and degradation of the circulating CdMT complex produces both a marked proteinuria and calcuria. The calcuria does not appear to stem from changes in renal energy metabolism or membrane transport of this element but is probably a secondary result of calcium binding to excreted proteins which are increased in urine to a similar extent. The studies also suggest that zinc status and maintenance of the renal ZnMT pool may play an important role in regulating cadmium-induced renal proteinuria and calcuria by preventing Cd2+ perturbation of the proximal tubule cell lysosome system.
We studied the potential of systemically administered aminoglycosides as a therapy for retinal degeneration resulting from premature termination codon (PTC) mutations. Aminoglycosides were systemically delivered to two rodent models of retinal degeneration: a transgenic rat model of dominant disease caused by a PTC in rhodopsin (S334ter); and a mouse model of recessive disease (rd12) caused by a PTC in the retinoid isomerase Rpe65. Initial luciferase reporter assays were undertaken to measure the efficiency of gentamicin-induced read-through in vitro. These experiments indicated that gentamicin treatment induced on average a 5.3% extra read-through of the S334ter PTC in vitro, but did not affect the rd12 PTC. Beginning at postnatal day 5, animals received daily subcutaneous injections of gentamicin or geneticin at a range of doses. The effect of the treatment on retinal degeneration was examined by histopathology and electroretinography (ERG). Systemic treatment with aminoglycoside significantly increased the number of surviving photoreceptors in the S334ter rat model over several weeks of treatment, but was not effective in slowing the retinal degeneration in the rd12 mouse model. Similarly, ERG recordings indicated better preservation of retinal function in the treated S334ter rats, but no difference was observed in the rd12 mice. Daily subcutaneous injection of 12.5mug/g gentamicin was the only regimen that inhibited retinal degeneration without apparent adverse systemic side effects. Reduced effectiveness beyond postnatal day 50 correlated with reduced ocular penetration of drug as seen in gentamicin-Texas red (GTTR) conjugation experiments. We conclude that, in the rat model, an approximately 5% reduction of abnormal truncated protein is sufficient to enhance photoreceptor survival. Such a change in truncated protein is consistent with beneficial effects seen when aminoglycosides has been used in other, non-ocular animal models. In the rd12 mouse, lack of efficacy was seen despite this particular PTC being theoretically more sensitive to aminoglycoside modification. We conclude that aminoglycoside read-through of PTCs in vitro and in vivo cannot be predicted just from genomic context. Because there is considerable genetic heterogeneity amongst retinal degenerations, pharmacologic therapies that are not gene-specific have significant appeal. Our findings suggest that if adverse issues such as systemic toxicity and limited ocular penetration can be overcome, small molecule therapeutics, such as aminoglycosides, which target classes of mutation could hold considerable potential as therapies for retinal disease.
Overall benefits of EGFR-TKIs are limited because these treatments are largely only for adenocarcinoma (ADC) with EGFR activating mutation. The treatments also usually lead to development of resistances. We have established a panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from treatment naïve Asian NSCLC patients, including those containing "classic" EGFR activating mutations. Some of these EGFR-mutated PDXs do not respond to erlotinib: LU1868 containing L858R/T790M mutations, and LU0858 having L858R mutation as well as c-MET gene amplification, both squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Treatment of LU0858 with crizotinib, a small molecule inhibitor for ALK and c-MET, inhibited tumor growth and c-MET activity. Combination of erlotinib and crizotinib caused complete response, indicating the activation of both EGFR and c-MET promote its growth/survival. LU2503 and LU1901, both with wild-type EGFR and c-MET gene amplification, showed complete response to crizotinib alone, suggesting that c-MET gene amplification, not EGFR signaling, is the main oncogenic driver. Interestingly, LU1868 with the EGFR L858R/T790M, but without c-met amplification, had a complete response to cetuximab. Our data offer novel practical approaches to overcome the two most common resistances to EGFR-TKIs seen in the clinic using marketed target therapies.
A 69-year-old man was referred to our department because of acute onset nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, dysarthria and gait disturbance. He had a 50-day-history of amebic dysentery and had been treated with 1,500 mg metronidazole per day. Neurological examination revealed dysphagia, ataxic speech, ataxia of the left extremities and the trunk, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in all extremities. Sensory impairment of all modalities was apparent in a glove and stocking pattern, with mild paresthesia. Brain MRI showed T2 high signal lesions in the bilateral cerebellar dentate nuclei, more markedly on the left. On brain SPECT, obvious low blood perfusion was observed in the left cerebellar hemisphere. These findings well explained the ataxia of the left limbs. One month after discontinuing metronidazole, the cerebellar ataxia, dysphagia and MRI abnormalities completely cleared. Therefore, central nervous system damage induced by metronidazole is considered reversible. In spite of the presence of the MRI lesion in the right dentate nucleus, the patient had no ataxia of the right extremities and there was no hypoperfusion in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Thus, metronidazole does not appear to have a direct neurotoxic effect on the central nervous system. On the other hand, nerve conduction studies showed axonal polyneuropathy, which was not improved one month after cessation of the drug; thus metronidazole seems to exert more damage on peripheral nerves.
In this study, the apoptotic mechanism and combinatorial chemotherapeutic effects of the cytotoxic phenylpropanoid compound 1'S-1'-acetoxyeugenol acetate (AEA), extracted from rhizomes of the Malaysian ethnomedicinal plant Alpinia conchigera Griff. (Zingiberaceae), on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were investigated for the first time. Data from cytotoxic and apoptotic assays such as live and dead and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage assays indicated that AEA was able to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, but not in normal human mammary epithelial cells. A microarray global gene expression analysis of MCF-7 cells, treated with AEA, suggested that the induction of tumor cell death through apoptosis was modulated through dysregulation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathway, as shown by the reduced expression of various κB-regulated gene targets. Consequent to this, western blot analysis of proteins corresponding to the NF-κB pathway indicated that AEA inhibited phosphorylation levels of the inhibitor of κB-kinase complex, resulting in the elimination of apoptotic resistance originating from NF-κB activation. This AEA-based apoptotic modulation was elucidated for the first time in this study, and gave rise to the proposal of an NF-κB model termed the 'Switching/Alternating Model.' In addition to this, AEA was also found to synergistically enhance the proapoptotic effects of paclitaxel, when used in combination with MCF-7 cells, presumably by a chemosensitizing role. Therefore, it was concluded that AEA isolated from the Malaysian tropical ginger (A. conchigera) served as a very promising candidate for further in-vivo development in animal models and in subsequent clinical trials involving patients with breast-related malignancies.
