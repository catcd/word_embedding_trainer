Fifty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive either one-day cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (PAC) chemotherapy (PAC-I) or five-day PAC (PAC-V) for advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Follow-up has been 120+ months or to death. Ninety-one percent had either suboptimal stage III or stage IV disease and 55% had grade 2 or 3 lesions. Two patients died of toxicity and were free of disease at autopsy. A third patient died of congestive heart failure with no disease at 103 months. Additionally, eight patients had a negative second-look laparotomy, and three (37.5%) are alive with no evidence of disease (NED) 133 to 144 months after diagnosis. Five patients (62.5%) died of disease 2 to 123 months after negative second-look. Patients with optimal stage III disease had a longer median progression-free interval (PFI) and survival (33.3 and 44.5 months, respectively) than those with suboptimal or stage IV disease (16.4 and 22.5 months, respectively), and the difference in median PFI is significant (P less than .02). Patients with ascites at diagnosis had a shorter median PFI and survival (14.7 and 18 months) than those without ascites (30.0 and 33.0 months). Both differences were significant (PFI, P less than .04; survival, P = .005). PAC produces response rates that are superior to those obtained historically with single-agent alkylating therapy. Late recurrences after negative second-look laparotomy suggest that 5-year survival data may be inadequate in ovarian carcinoma.
The tissue distribution and hepatic microsomal metabolism of amiodarone were studied in a hyperlipidemic rat model. Rats were rendered hyperlipidemic by the intraperitoneal injection of poloxamer 407. Other normolipidemic animals given saline in place of poloxamer 407 were used as control animals. After single intravenous injection of amiodarone HCl (25mg/kg) rats were anesthetized and plasma and tissue specimens were obtained. Liver microsomal protein was harvested and used to measure velocity of desethylamiodarone formation from amiodarone and cytochrome P450 (CYP) protein expression. Hyperlipidemia caused large increases in plasma concentrations of amiodarone. In tissues, however, concentrations of drug selectively increased, decreased or did not change. In heart, the site of action of the drug, as well as liver and spleen, amiodarone concentrations increased. In other tissues such as kidney, lung and brain, concentrations decreased. No changes were seen in fat or thyroid. Decreases were observed in liver metabolic efficiency, and expression of CYP3A1/2 and 2C11. No changes were seen in CYP2B1/2, 2C6, 2D1 or 1A2. This experimental hyperlipidemia caused a complex pattern of changes in tissue distribution of AM. In addition, there are decreases in the expression of some important rat CYP isoenzymes.
We are reporting a child with congenital panhypopituitarism, in whom deficient fetal steroidogenesis was suspected prenatally because of undetectable estriol levels measured in the maternal triple-marker screen. No fetal abnormalities were detected by ultrasonography. Amniocentesis demonstrated a normal 46,XX karyotype. Measurement of maternal urinary steroids failed to show elevation in the excretion of the major precursor for estriol, 16 alpha-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone, indicating that the fetus did not have steroid sulfatase deficiency (placental sulfatase deficiency), the most common genetic cause of extremely low estriol. The steroid analysis excluded other rare single gene defects, including aromatase deficiency and 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. We therefore suspected that the cause of low estriol in this fetus was adrenal insufficiency. Postnatal evaluation was consistent with panhypopituitarism, characterized by deficiency of all anterior pituitary hormones. Because this screen is now offered to more than half the pregnant women in the United States, reports of low estriol levels have become increasingly common. Therefore, it is essential that physicians be familiar with the various etiologies, perform the appropriate antenatal evaluation to determine the specific cause, and closely monitor both mother and child ante- and postnatally.
Minor surgical procedures do not always require hospitalisation for several days. The use of short-acting anaesthetic agents should make such procedures possible on an ambulatory basis. A study was undertaken of the combination of tiapride and ketamine in 97 women seen in the department of obstetrics for therapeutic abortion or biopsy-curettage. The drug combination was satisfactory in the great majority of cases. It is sufficiently analgesic for surgery of this type. The minimal level of narcosis ensures rapid recovery without any subsequent falling asleep again. The psychomotor agitation caused by ketamine is counteracted by the doses of tiapride used. Only vomiting may be felt to be too frequent. Nevertheless, this occurred in women who were fully awake and had no major consequences.
Mancozeb, a fungicide of ethylenebisdithiocarbamate group was orally administered at 800 mg/kg body weight to male Swiss albino mice for 5, 10, 20 and 30 days. Daily body weight of the mice were recorded. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after 24 h of terminal exposure of mancozeb. Testes weight decreased significantly in 20 and 30 days mancozeb treated mice. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of spermatogonia, diameter of spermatocytes and spermatids in 20 days and number of spermatids in 10 days mancozeb treated mice. Histologic studies of the testis of the mice treated with mancozeb for long duration revealed spermatogenesis inhibition reflected by significant decrease in the number of spermatogenic cells and sperms, when compared with that of controls. In the mice treated with mancozeb for 20 and 30 days showed significant decrease in the weight of the prostate gland. However weight of Cowper's glands decreased significantly in 30 days mancozeb treated mice. There was significant decrease in the kidney, spleen and liver weight, where as thyroid weight increased significantly in mice treated with mancozeb for 30 days. However, thymus weight increased significantly only in the mice treated with mancozeb for 10, 20 and 30 days. In mice treated with mancozeb for 20 days caused significant decrease in the level of protein and a significant increase in the level of total lipids in the testis. However, there was significant decrease in the level of glycogen in the kidney. In mice treated with mancozeb for 30 days caused significant decrease in the levels of protein and glycogen and significant increase in the level of total lipids in the testis and liver and a significant decrease in the protein, glycogen and total lipids in the kidney. These observed effects of mancozeb on testis and biochemical constituents may be due to hormonal imbalance in any of the stages in the hypothalamo-hypophysial-testicular axis.
This review summarizes drug induced nephrotic syndrome. Major drugs which induce drug related nephrotoxicity are antibiotics, NSAID, radiocontrast media, anticancer drug and antirheumatic drug. Drug induced nephropathy can show various forms of renal diseases. The nephropathy consists of acute tubular necrosis, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, pre-renal type renal failure, obstructive renal failure, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis and glomerular damage. Major drugs which induce nephrotic syndrome and glomerular damage are gold, penicillamine, bucillamine and NSAID. In the nephrotic syndrome due to these drugs, the major type of renal disease is the membranous glomerulonephritis and the nephropathy resolves completely when the drug is withdrawn; renal function does not deteriorate, and corticosteroids are unnecessary.
The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae drives the development and evaluation of new antipneumococcal agents, especially for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. The aims of the present study were to assess the antibacterial effectiveness of two new quinolones, garenoxacin (BMS; BMS-284756) and moxifloxacin (MOX) in experimental meningitis caused by a vancomycin (VAN)-tolerant S. pneumoniae strain and to compare the results with those obtained by therapy with VAN and ceftriaxone (CRO) in combination. Meningitis was induced in young male New Zealand White rabbits by intracisternal inoculation of a VAN-tolerant pneumococcal strain (strain Tupelo) from a child with meningitis. Sixteen hours after inoculation, therapy was given by intravenous administration of BMS at 20 mg/kg of body weight, followed 5 h later by administration at a dosage of 10 mg/kg (n = 9 animals) or MOX as two doses of 20 mg/kg every 5 h (n = 8 animals). For comparison, we studied the following groups: (i) animals treated with VAN (20 mg/kg every 5 h, three doses) and CRO (125 mg/kg, one dose) (n = 9), (ii) animals infected with a VAN-tolerant strain but not treated (n = 8), (iii) animals infected with a VAN-tolerant pneumococcus isolated from the nasopharynx of a carrier and treated with BMS (n = 8), and (iv) animals infected with a cephalosporin-resistant type 6B S. pneumoniae strain and treated with BMS (n = 6). The MICs of penicillin, CRO, VAN, BMS, and MOX for the Tupelo strain were 2, 1, 0.5, 0.06, and 0.03 micro g/ml, respectively. The rates of killing of strain Tupelo (the change in the log(10) number of CFU per milliliter per hour) in cerebrospinal fluid at 5 h were -0.70 +/- 0.35, -0.61 +/- 0.44, and -0.49 +/- 0.36 for BMS, MOX, and VAN-CRO, respectively. Therapy with BMS and MOX was as effective as therapy with VAN-CRO against VAN-tolerant pneumococcal meningitis in rabbits.
Sufficient folate supplementation is essential for a multitude of biological processes and diverse organ systems. At least five distinct inherited disorders of folate transport and metabolism are presently known, all of which cause systemic folate deficiency. We identified an inherited brain-specific folate transport defect that is caused by mutations in the folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) gene coding for folate receptor alpha (FRalpha). Three patients carrying FOLR1 mutations developed progressive movement disturbance, psychomotor decline, and epilepsy and showed severely reduced folate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated profound hypomyelination, and MR-based in vivo metabolite analysis indicated a combined depletion of white-matter choline and inositol. Retroviral transfection of patient cells with either FRalpha or FRbeta could rescue folate binding. Furthermore, CSF folate concentrations, as well as glial choline and inositol depletion, were restored by folinic acid therapy and preceded clinical improvements. Our studies not only characterize a previously unknown and treatable disorder of early childhood, but also provide new insights into the folate metabolic pathways involved in postnatal myelination and brain development.
By testing the effects of antecedent copulation on subsequent apomorphine-induced penile erection we sought to test an implicit assumption in the research on drug-induced "spontaneous" erection--namely, that this research provides information relevant to the regulation of erection in copula. In experiment 1, male rats were observed after being injected SC with 0, 15, 30, 60, or 120 micrograms/kg apomorphine (APO); 60 micrograms/kg yielded the maximum probability of erection and yawning. In experiment 2, males were injected with 60 micrograms/kg APO after no exposure to females, after three intromissions, or after copulation to sexual satiety. There was no significant effect of three intromissions, but sexually sated males displayed no erections, the first evidence that copulation affects drug-induced erections. In experiment 3, males had one ejaculation, three intromissions, or no exposure to females immediately before injection with APO (60 micrograms/kg, SC) or ascorbic acid vehicle. APO induced both erection and yawning, but neither behavior was reliably affected by copulation in APO-treated males. Among vehicle-treated males, those having three intromissions or one ejaculation before the test had shorter erection latencies and more erections than males not exposed to females. Thus, a relatively small amount of copulation resulted in a level of erectile response similar to that of APO-treated males. Optimal doses of APO may be no more effective in promoting erection in male rats than are the natural neurochemical sequelae to copulation.
The effects of pharmacological alteration of the monoamine systems were investigated in a canine model of narcolepsy. Cataplexy was quantified in eight severely affected dogs by means of the food-elicited cataplexy test. The specific norepinephrine (NE) uptake blocker nisoxetine, and (to a much lesser extent) the specific serotonin (5-HT) uptake blocker fluoxetine, significantly suppressed cataplexy, as did the tricyclic antidepressants protriptyline, amitriptyline, and chlorimipramine. Thus, experimental cataplexy is suppressed more by inhibition of the uptake of NE than of 5-HT. Methylphenidate, the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker clonidine, and the dopamine receptor blocker pimozide also suppressed cataplexy in dogs. The beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, the fatty acid gamma-hydroxybutyrate, and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors clorgyline and pargyline had little or no effect. With one exception (pimozide), all the drugs that suppressed cataplexy are known to be potent suppressors of REM sleep. The suppression of cataplexy induced by nisoxetine or protriptyline was reversed by the anticholinesterase physostigmine, further supporting a postulated aminergic-cholinergic interaction in the mechanisms for cataplexy.
Observations and conclusions from initial acute and maintenance bromperidol clinical trials conducted in the USA are presented along with an overview of the clinical development program. Thirty diagnosed schizophrenic patients, recruited from private practice, were admitted to either study. Patients were controlled with bromperidol administered only once daily. The acute patients received an average dose of 14-23 mg day during the month-long inpatient stay. The average maintenance dose was calculated to be approximately 8 mg. Overall, patients received from 3-39 mg for up to four months. Pre-treatment vs. 4 week treatment BPRS scores showed highly significant decreases in the five NCDEU (New Clinical Drug Evaluation Unit, which developed the accepted US psychiatric rating scales) behavioral symptom clusters analyzed. Two thirds of the patients were much to very much improved over this same interval based on clinical global ratings. Minimal side effects were noted. In particular, fewer acute neuromuscular reactions and less weight gain were noted. Based on the experience to date, bromperidol will be a significant addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of schizophrenia in both acute and chronic cases.
In 1975 we performed an open trial with bromperidol in 25 hospitalized schizophrenic patients. Effects and side-effects were registered by means of the AMP system. Patients were treated up to 30 days and the dosage of bromperidol was increased depending on effects and side-effects up to 5 mg per day. Bromperidol showed a good effect on productive schizophrenic symtpoms and caused a significant reduction of accompanying depressive symptoms. Data of this open trial were compared with data of two open trials with clozapine and haloperidol which were performed using the same methods. We compared the three open trials and found similar effects on psychotic symptomatology, but a different severity of extrapyramidal side-effects. A double-blind comparison between bromperidol and perphenazine in 40 schizophrenic patients showed a strong antipsychotic efficacy of bromperidol and an earlier onset of its effects.
This study aims to propose a comprehensive new model for schizophrenia, which shows PPI disruption at baseline state as an endophenotype, the development of cross-sensitization to an NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 as a clinical phenotype of the progression into treatment-resistance, and accompanied induction of apoptosis in the medial prefrontal cortex as a critical possibility during the progression. Repeated administration of a high dose of methamphetamine (METH) (2.5 mg/kg), which could increase glutamate levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), induced TUNEL-positive cells in this region, accompanied development of behavioral cross-sensitization to MK-801 in response to a challenge injection of MK-801, and PPI disruption at baseline state without a challenge injection. Olanzapine (OLZ) (1.0 mg/kg) and risperidone (RIS) (0.1 mg/kg), which inhibited and remarkably attenuated METH (2.5 mg/kg)-induced increases in glutamate levels, respectively, blocked not only the induction of TUNEL-positive cells in the mPFC but also the accompanied development of above behavioral abnormalities. These findings suggest that repeating the METH-induced glutamate release produces behavioral abnormalities as a clinical phenotype of schizophrenia, accompanied apoptosis as a critical possibility during the progression, and suggest that sufficient dose of olanzapine and risperidone can block the development of these behavioral abnormalities and accompanied apoptosis during the progression.
The histophagous ciliate Philasterides dicentrarchi causes fatal scuticociliatosis in farmed turbot Scophthalmus maximus and sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax. The present study screened 52 candidate antiprotozoals for activity against this pathogen in vitro. Of these compounds, 14 were effective (i.e. killed all ciliates within a 24 h assay period). In descending order of efficacy (minimum lethal concentration 100 to 0.8 ppm), these were niclosamide, oxyclozanide, bithionol sulfoxide, toltrazuril, N-(2'-hydroxy-5'-chloro-benzoyl) 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, furaltadone, doxycycline hyclate, formalin, albendazole, carnidazole, pyrimethamine, quinacrine hydrochloride and quinine sulfate. Administration in filtered seawater rather than phosphate-buffered saline inactivated doxycycline hyclate and albendazole, and markedly reduced that of bithionol sulfoxide and toltrazuril, suggesting that these compounds may not be effective in bath administration. In view of these findings, we discuss the potential utility of chemotherapy as a strategy for the control of scuticociliatosis in farmed turbot and sea bass.
Twenty four chronic psychotic patients were assigned at random to bromperidol or haloperidol. The mean dose for bromperidol was 4 to 8 mg in one intake in the morning and for haloperidol 4 mg given twice a day. Regular evaluation was performed by BPRS, global clinical impression, side-effects scale, hematological and biochemical screening. It appears that bromperidol is a potent antipsychotic drug with a duration of 24 h. Compared to haloperidol, it favours social integration by a mild but definite activating property. No major side-effects were observed.
The development of acute lung injury (ALI) during sepsis almost doubles the mortality rate of patients. The efficacy of current treatment strategies is low as treatment is usually initiated following the onset of symptoms. Inflammation is one of the main mechanisms of autoimmune disorders and is a common feature of sepsis. The suppression of inflammation is therefore an important mechanism for the treatment of sepsis. Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) has been demonstrated to play a role in the regulation of inflammation. Resveratrol, a potent Sirt1 activator, exhibits anti‑inflammatory properties. However, the role of resveratrol for the treatment of ALI during sepsis is not fully understood. In the present study, the anti‑inflammatory role of Sirt1 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced TC‑1 cell line and its therapeutic role in ALI was investigated in a mouse model of sepsis. The upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9, interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase was induced by LPS in the mouse model of sepsis and the TC‑1 cell line, and resveratrol suppressed the overexpression of these proinflammatory molecules in a dose‑dependent manner. Resveratrol decreased pulmonary edema in the mouse model of sepsis induced by LPS. In addition, resveratrol improved lung function and reduced pathological alterations in the mouse model of sepsis. Knockdown of Sirt1 by RNA interference resulted in an increased susceptibility of TC‑1 cells to LPS stimulation and diminished the anti‑inflammatory effect of resveratrol. These results demonstrated that resveratrol inhibits LPS‑induced ALI and inflammation via Sirt1, and indicated that Sirt1 is an efficient target for the regulation of LPS‑induced ALI and inflammation. The present study provides insights into the treatment of ALI during sepsis.
Pharmacological testing has several indications in the diagnosis of arrhythmia. It is used for the diagnosis of bradycardia-related syncope either during non invasive tests as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope, but also for the diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome or isoproterenol infusion during the head up tilt test to induce a vasovagal syncope or during electrophysiological study to look for infrahisian AV block or organic sick sinus syndrome after injection of Ajmaline or to know if sick sinus syndrome or suprahisian AV block are reversible after atropine and are vagal-related. It is used for the diagnosis of supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia; isoproterenol is largely used generally during electrophysiological study. The infusion of isoproterenol is required in exercise-related arrhythmias, in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, in idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. ATP can be used to induce a vagal-related atrial fibrillation and may help to differentiate a reentry through accessory pathway or AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia. It is used for the detection and the evaluation of prognosis of some diseases at risk of sudden death. Isoproterenol infusion is required in the preexcitation syndrome to look for the shortening of accessory refractory period. Ajmaline or flecaïnide injection is mandatory in the family of a patient with a Brugada syndrome to detect the disease.
To investigate the potential role of an aberrant cellular DNA repair in target cells during malignant transformation we studied cell type-specific mRNA expression of the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (O6-AGT) in normal and regenerating rat liver, chronic hepatitis and preneoplastic liver lesions by in situ hybridization and semiautomatic image analysis.
O6-AGT mRNA expression was found to be four to five times higher in hepatocytes than in nonparenchymal cells. A 1.9-fold increase in O6-AGT mRNA was observed after partial hepatectomy. Intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine led to a 1.3-fold and 2.6-fold rise in periportal and perivenous hepatocytes, respectively. Ethylnitrosourea produced an enhancement of mRNA levels up to 1.6-fold in hepatocytes without regional differences. In megalocytic hepatocytes of Long-Evans Cinnamon rats with chronic hepatitis, a 4.4-fold mRNA induction was found. In small preneoplastic lesions induced after chronic diethylnitrosamine-exposure, O6-AGT mRNA expression was identical to that of adjacent normal tissue. Intermediate and large lesions revealed 1.5- to 1.6-fold higher mRNA levels.
These results suggest an induction of O6-AGT mRNA expression in hepatocellular target tissue under conditions of increased carcinogen sensitivity . The O6-AGT expression in early preneoplastic lesions did not differ from normal surrounding liver tissue, thus excluding the possibility that progression of preneoplasia in rat liver is associated with a deficient mRNA expression of this DNA repair protein. On the contrary, enhanced O6-AGT mRNA expression in more advanced foci and early neoplastic nodules may confer a selective advantage upon early malignant hepatocytes with regard to further tumor progression.
There are reports that 1,2-dichloropropane, a constituent of many commercial solvents and stain removers in Italy, has caused severe liver damage and, sometimes, acute renal failure. Between 1980 and 1983 three cases of 1,2-dichloropropane intoxication (1 by ingestion, 2 by inhalation) were observed. Clinical features included severe liver damage, acute renal failure (2 patients), haemolytic anaemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The most surprising features were haemolytic anaemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation which have not been reported before. The clinical picture was similar despite different modes of exposure.
Succinylpurines accumulate in the body fluids of patients with adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiency but their source in the cerebrospinal fluid remains obscure. Study based on the incorporation of 13C-stable isotope-labeled glycine into cultured oligodendroglia from ADSL-deficient patient and the measurement of labeled products by LC/MS/MS showed total intracellular concentrations of succinylpurines from 45 to 99μmol/l and so these results suggest that these cells can be the source of the compounds in vivo.
Arsenic, an important human toxin, is naturally occurring in groundwater and its accumulation in plants and animals have assumed a menacing proportion in a large part of the world, particularly Asia. Epidemiological studies have shown a strong association between chronic arsenic exposure and various adverse health effects, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological defects and cancer of lung, skin, bladder, liver and kidney. The protective role of the fruits of Emblica officinalis (500 mg/kg b.wt.) was studied in adult Swiss albino mice against arsenic induced hepatopathy. Arsenic treated group (NaAsO(2), 4 mg/kg b.wt.) had a significant increase in serum transaminases and lipid peroxidation (LPO) content in liver, whereas significant decrease was recorded in hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and serum alkaline phosphatase activity. Combined treatment of Emblica and arsenic (pre and post) declined the serum transaminases and LPO content in liver whereas significant increase was noticed in SOD, CAT, GST and serum alkaline phosphatase activities. Liver histopathology showed that Emblica fruit extract had reduced karyolysis, karyorrhexis, necrosis and cytoplasmic vacuolization induced by NaAsO(2) intoxication. Thus it can be concluded that pre- and post-supplementation of E. officinalis fruit extract significantly reduced arsenic induced oxidative stress in liver.
In the present study, the efficacy of green tea catechins (GTC from the plant Camellia sinensis), with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), as the major component, was studied in relation to hepatic oxidative abnormalities in atherosclerotic rats. When male albino Wistar rats were fed an atherogenic diet for 30 days and then treated with saline for 7 or 15 days, there was a significant decline in hepatic mean activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase), and non-enzymatic antioxidants (reduced glutathione, vitamins C and E) while there was a significant elevation in the mean level of hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), in comparison to the values noted in control rats fed a normal diet. In addition, a concomitant increase in the activities of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was noted, when compared to the values in control rats. Following intraperitoneal administration of GTC (100mg/kg) for 7 or 15 days to rats fed the atherogenic diet, significantly higher mean activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and lower mean levels of MDA in hepatic tissue and lower mean activities of AST, ALT, ALP and LDH in serum were observed, compared to the values in the rats fed the atherogenic diet and treated with saline. Histopathological studies were performed to provide direct evidence of the atherogenic diet-induced hepatic changes and of the hepatoprotective effect of GTC. These results suggest that EGCG as a major component of green tea catechins may protect against the hepatic abnormalities occurring in Wistar rats fed an atherogenic diet.
The aim of this study was to investigate the possible interaction between neuronal cholecystokinin (CCK) and opiate dependence. Rats were made dependent to morphine and the ability of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8) and Tyr(SO3H)-gNle-mGly-Trp-(NMe)Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2 (BC 264), a selective agonist of CCK-B receptors, to induce signs of morphine withdrawal after ICV injection was tested. Behavioral responses were compared to those occurring during the naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal syndrome. In contrast to naloxone, CCK-8 (0.1, 1, and 10 micrograms, ICV) did not precipitate any sign of withdrawal. BC 264 (0.1, 1, and 10 micrograms, ICV) induced a strong hyperlocomotion and wet dog shakes in morphine-dependent rats, the latter effect also observed in nondependent animals. In rats receiving acute morphine, BC 264 induced an opposite effect (i.e., blockade of morphine-induced hyperactivity). Taken together, these results suggest that CCK plays only a minor role in the expression of morphine physical dependence.
Previously we have shown that intrathecal administration of midazolam can increase or decrease morphine-induced antinociception, depending upon relative concentration of these drugs by modulating spinal opioid receptors, and it also can inhibit morphine-induced tolerance and dependence in the rat. Now we report that midazolam also influences catalepsy, lethality, and analgesia induced by morphine in the rat. In the acute treatment, animals were first treated with saline or midazolam (0.03 to 30.0 mg/kg, b.wt., IP), and 30 min later with a second injection of saline or morphine (1.0 to 100.0 mg/kg, b.wt., SC). The catalepsy was measured 60 min after the second injection and lethality was checked after 24 h. Midazolam injection increased the morphine-induced catalepsy and lethality. In the chronic treatment, animals were injected with two injections daily for 11 days. The first injection consisted of saline or midazolam (0.03 to 3.0 mg/kg, b.wt., IP), and 30 min later with a second injection of saline or morphine (10.0 mg/kg, b.wt., IP) was given. Lethality, antinociception, and body weight were measured. Chronic morphine treatment also increased lethality in a dose-dependent manner. Chronic treatment with midazolam and morphine increased the antinociception on day 11, as measured in the tail-flick and hot-plate tests. Midazolam administration also prevented the morphine-induced weight loss. These results suggest a strong interaction between midazolam and morphine in altering catalepsy, lethality, and analgesia in rat.
We have recently evaluated a 54-year-old woman who had migraine without aura in her history but presenting with a typical hypnic headache (HH) which is presumably not a primary headache but associated with an ergotamine overuse headache. Her HH was relieved with a washout protocol which includes 75 mg amitriptyline daily with the addition of metoclopramide and encouraging her not to use any analgesics. Our aim was to report this unique patient to emphasize this rare association and to discuss the possible pathophysiological implications for both of these entities.
Benin has recently shifted its national antimalarial drug policy from monotherapies to combinations containing artemisinin derivatives. When this decision was taken, the available information on alternatives to chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, the first- and second-line treatment, was sparse.
In 2003 - 2005, before the drug policy change, a randomized, open-label, clinical trial was carried out on the efficacy of chloroquine, and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine alone or combined with artesunate, with the aim of providing policy makers with the information needed to formulate a new antimalarial drug policy. Children between six and 59 months of age, with uncomplicated malaria and living in the lagoon costal area in southern Benin, were randomly allocated to one of the three study arms and followed up for 28 days.
Treatment failure (PCR corrected) was significantly lower in the artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine group (4/77, 5.3%) than in chloroquine group(51/71, 71.8%) or the sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine alone group (30/70, 44.1%) (p < 0.001). Despite high sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine failure, its combination with artesunate greatly improved treatment efficacy.
In Benin, artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine is efficacious and could be used when the recommended artemisinin-based combinations (artemether-lumefantrine and amodiaquine-artesunate) are not available. However, because sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine is also used in pregnant women as intermittent preventive treatment, its combination with artesunate should not be widely employed in malaria patients as this may compromise the efficacy of intermittent preventive treatment.
Angiotensin receptor antagonists represent a new class of drugs for the treatment of patients with hypertension. Reduction of blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension requires increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Losartan, the first orally active, nonpeptide angiotensin antagonist, specifically competes with angiotensin II (Ang II) for the AT1 receptor and reversibly alters the receptor. Maximum blood pressure reductions occur after doses of approximately 50 mg, although some patients will require 100 mg; the parent compound and a metabolite are responsible for a smooth 24-hour effect on blood pressure. Once-daily dosing with losartan has been documented to be safe. The drug's safety has been evaluated in 4,058 patients; of these patients, more than 1,200 were treated for longer than 6 months and more than 800 were treated for longer than 1 year with doses of 10 mg to 150 mg. Overall, no hypertensive patients were withdrawn from treatment because of elevated serum creatinine or potassium levels, and there were no reports of angioedema. In addition, some reductions in plasma uric acid levels were noted. Cough occurred significantly less often in patients treated with losartan than in those treated with hydrochlorothiazide or lisinopril. In contrast to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, losartan does not activate bradykinin-nitric oxide-prostanoid vasodilation.
A 21-year-old nurse presented with severe headache after ingesting one phenylpropanolamine (Trimolets) tablet. Examination revealed hypertension. Although no specific therapy was administered to the patient, her blood pressure normalized within a few hours of admission to hospital and has remained normal since. The patient declined rechallenge with the suspected drug.
