The nephrotoxicity of paracetamol (acetaminophen) administered to rats in doses of 300 mg/kg/day for periods up to 32 weeks was increased in the presence of experimentally induced pyelonephritis. The same dose of paracetamol failed to cause renal lesions in rats without pyelonephritis. Generally the pyelonephritic reactions were more severe in animals receiving paracetamol as compared to those in whom the drug was witheld. Thickened basement membranes of microvessels and tubules associated with papillary necrosis, and attempted healing of a necrotic papillary stump were unusual experimental findings which resemble pathology considered characteristic of clinical analgesic nephropathy.
Resveratrol has been purported to modify risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disease. We sought to examine the effects of resveratrol in a porcine model of metabolic syndrome and chronic myocardial ischemia. Yorkshire swine were fed either a normal diet (control), a high cholesterol diet (HCD), or a high cholesterol diet with supplemental resveratrol (HCD-R; 100mg/kg/day) for 11 weeks. After 4 weeks of diet modification a baseline cardiovascular MRI was performed and an ameroid constrictor was placed on the left circumflex coronary artery of each animal to induce chronic myocardial ischemia. At 7 weeks, a second cardiovascular MRI was performed and swine were sacrificed and myocardial tissue harvested. Resveratrol supplementation resulted in lower body mass indices, serum cholesterol, and C-reactive protein levels, improved glucose tolerance and endothelial function, and favorably augmented signaling pathways associated with myocardial metabolism. Interestingly, serum tumor necrosis factor-α levels were not influenced by resveratrol treatment. Immunoblotting for markers of metabolism demonstrated that insulin receptor substrate-1, glucose transporters 1 and 4, and phospho-AMPK were increased in the HCD-R group. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and retinol binding protein 4 were downregulated in the HCD-R group as compared to the HCD group. Myocardial perfusion and function at rest as assessed with magnetic resonance imaging were not different between groups. By favorably influencing risk factors, resveratrol may decrease the burden of chronic metabolic disease and improve cardiovascular health.
Case control studies in adults suggest that defective alleles in the gene that codes for the hepatic cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) protect against nicotine dependence (ND) and higher levels of cigarette consumption. These two hypotheses were tested in young adolescents.
Self reports of tobacco use and ND symptoms were collected every 3-4 months in a prospective study of 1293 grade 7 students from a convenience sample of 10 schools.
281 smokers with genetic data were analysed; those who were not already tobacco dependent and who had inhaled (n = 228) were followed 29.9 months on average, until they became dependent or were censored.
The association between metabolic activity, represented by CYP2A6 genotype, and conversion to dependence was analysed using Cox's proportional hazards model.
During follow up 67 subjects (29.4%) became dependent. Relative to CYP2A6*1/*1, having 1-2 copies of the inactive CYP2A6*2 or *4 variant was a strong risk factor for developing dependence (hazard ratio 2.8, 95% confidence 1.3 to 6.3). Subjects with 1-2 partially inactive CYP2A6*9 or *12 variants were not at increased risk. Mean past-week cigarette consumption at the end of follow up (controlling for age, sex, and number of months since first inhalation) among dependent subjects was 29.1 among normal inactivators, compared to 17.2, and 12.7 among slower (1-2 copies of *9 or *12), and slowest (1-2 copies of *2 or *4) inactivators, respectively (p = 0.09).
Adolescents with 1-2 copies of CYP2A6*2 or *4 are at substantially increased risk of becoming dependent but smoke less once dependent. Genetic risk for ND may need to be considered in the conceptualisation of tobacco control programmes for adolescents.
Tamoxifen is the primary hormonal therapy for breast cancer as well as its chemoprevention. It is used in the management of breast cancer because of its anti oestrogenic effect. It is however an agonist on the endometrium with undesirable effects of endometrial proliferation with the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Several authors have reported cases of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma following tamoxifen therapy for breast carcinoma. No such report has been made from Nigeria . This paper presents the first case of endometrial carcinoma following tamoxifen therapy for breast carcinoma in a 52 year old Nigerian female. It also highlights the recommended guidelines for the follow up of women with breast cancer on tamoxifen therapy.
The long-term effectiveness of acetazolamide (AZA) and its side effects, especially the formation of renal calculi, were investigated in a prospective study when AZA was used as an adjunct to other antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of refractory epilepsies. The subjects comprised 37 patients aged from 1 to 17 years (mean age, 8 years and 1 month) whose seizures were hard to control with the use of two or more drugs among sodium valproate, carbamazepine and clonazepam. Thirty-two of the 37 patients were complicated with mental retardation. A daily dose of 10mg/kg of AZA was first administered and then the dosage was increased up to 20mg/kg based on the clinical response and side effects. The maintenance daily dosage of AZA (12.2+/-4.2mg/kg) produced a steady-state plasma concentration of 6.2+/-4.5 microg/ml. Among the 37 patients, complete seizure control for more than 3 years was obtained in four patients. Although there were no significant differences, all of the four patients were classified as having symptomatic localization-related epilepsies. Seizures recurred in five after complete remission for at least 6 months, and six showed >50% decrease in seizure frequency for more than 6 months after the introduction of AZA. Twenty-eight patients, who were taking AZA for 10 months to 14 years (mean, 6 years and 5 months), were examined for the formation of renal calculi. None of them showed evidence of renal calculi. This study reinforces the idea that AZA may be a useful adjunct drug in selected patients with refractory symptomatic localization-related epilepsies.
The nephrotoxic action of anticancer drugs such as nitrogranulogen (NG), methotrexate (MTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cyclophosphamide (CY) administered alone or in combination [MTX + 5-FU + CY (CMF)] was evaluated in experiments on Wistar rats. After drug administration, creatinine concentrations in the plasma and in the urine of the rats were determined, as well as creatinine clearance. Histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was also performed. After MTX administration a significant increase (p = 0.0228) in the plasma creatinine concentration and a significant (p = 0.0001) decrease in creatinine clearance was noted compared to controls. After the administration of NG, 5-FU and CY neither a statistically significant increase in creatinine concentration nor an increase in creatinine clearance was observed compared to the group receiving no cytostatics. Following polytherapy according to the CMF regimen, a statistically significant decrease (p = 0.0343) in creatinine clearance was found, but creatinine concentration did not increase significantly compared to controls. CY caused hemorrhagic cystitis in 40% of rats, but it did not cause this complication when combined with 5-FU and MTX. Histologic changes were found in rat kidneys after administration of MTX, CY and NG, while no such change was observed after 5-FU and joint administration of MTX + 5-FU + CY compared to controls. Our studies indicate that nephrotoxicity of MTX + 5-FU + CY administered jointly is lower than in monotherapy.
Marked alterations have been demonstrated to occur in the platelet alpha2-adrenoceptors of patients with essential hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine whether antihypertensive treatment with alpha-adrenergic blocker doxazosin or beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol can affect the affinity and the density of platelet alpha2-adrenoceptors in such patients.
In two groups of 22 previously untreated, essential hypertensive patients, the mean affinity (Kd) and density (B(max)) of platelet alpha2-adrenoceptors were studied by [3H]-UK 14304 binding assays; the first assays were performed before any medication was begun, the second were performed after treatment for up to 13 weeks with doxazosin or propranolol. A third group of 22 healthy normotensive volunteers matched by age, sex and body mass index was used as control.
Blood pressure did not differ significantly in the two hypertensive groups, and treatment with the two drugs resulted in closely similar, normal blood pressure levels. Kd and B(max) values were significantly higher in the two hypertensive groups than in controls. After treatment with propranolol the binding parameters did not change significantly, whereas after treatment with doxazosin Kd and B(max) returned to normotensive values.
In previously untreated, essential hypertensive patients platelet alpha2-adrenoceptors have a lower affinity but a higher density than in normotensive subjects. Despite similar effects on blood pressure, the treatment with the alpha-adrenergic blocker doxazosin is followed by restoration of normal findings in the binding assays of platelet alpha2-adrenoceptors whereas the treatment with the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol does not alter the Kd and B(max) values.
Buprenorphine (BPN) is a prescription analgesic with mixed opioid agonist and antagonist properties. This pilot study conducted detailed case studies with 15 methadone dependent patients. The study sought to determine whether repeated low doses (0.15 to 0.3 mg) of sublingual BPN would relieve opioid withdrawal symptoms. Subjects developed mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms within 26 to 31 hours of methadone discontinuation. Once in withdrawal, the subjects received 0.15 mg of BPN sublingually. A second dose of 0.15 mg was administered in an hour, and a 0.30 mg dose in 2 hours, if the subject obtained no relief of withdrawal symptoms. In 6 subjects a low dose of 0.15 to 0.30 mg sublingual BPN resulted in the disappearance of subjective and objective withdrawal symptoms within 10 minutes to 2.5 hours. Four others had brief, partial relief of symptoms. Five subjects failed to experience any relief of withdrawal symptoms after a total of 0.6 mg BPN administered over 3 hours. One nonresponder suffered what appeared to be a severe precipitated withdrawal reaction similar to that which can be produced in addicts by a naloxone challenge. The 4 Caucasian responders required 1 to 2 hours to respond to BPN, whereas the 2 African-American responders required only 10 to 20 minutes. Low (analgesic) doses of BPN were sufficient to treat all methadone withdrawal symptoms in 6 of 15 subjects. There may be ethnic differences in response to BPN. Low dose BPN may play a role in carefully monitored heroin detoxification treatment.
The zinc transporter ZIP4 (Slc39a4) is important for proper mammalian development and is an essential gene in mice. Recent studies suggest that this gene may also play a role in pancreatic cancer.
Herein, we present evidence that this essential zinc transporter is expressed in hepatocellular carcinomas. Zip4 mRNA and protein were dramatically elevated in hepatocytes in the majority of human hepatocellular carcinomas relative to noncancerous surrounding tissues, as well as in hepatocytes in hepatocellular carcinomas occurring in farnesoid X receptor-knockout mice. Interestingly, meta-analysis of microarray data in the Geo and Oncomine databases suggests that Zip4 mRNA may also be elevated in many types of cancer. Potential mechanisms of action of ZIP4 were examined in cultured cell lines. RNAi knockdown of Zip4 in mouse Hepa cells significantly increased apoptosis and modestly slowed progression from G(0)/G(1) to S phase when cells were released from hydroxyurea block into zinc-deficient medium. Cell migration assays revealed that RNAi knockdown of Zip4 in Hepa cells depressed in vitro migration whereas forced over-expression in Hepa cells and MCF-7 cells enhanced in vitro migration.
ZIP4 may play a role in the acquisition of zinc by hepatocellular carcinomas, and potentially many different cancerous cell-types, leading to repressed apoptosis, enhanced growth rate and enhanced invasive behavior.
The systemic administration of gemcitabine (GEM) has been accepted as a standard treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The major mediator of cellular uptake of GEM is the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) whose expression is up-regulated by thymidylate synthase inhibitors, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). S-1 is a novel oral derivative of the 5-FU prodrug tegafur combined with two modulators. Recent clinical trials have reported the promising effect of S-1 in pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between different schedules and the effects of GEM/S-1 combination therapy on pancreatic cancer xenograft models.
Human pancreatic tumor xenografts were prepared by subcutaneous implantation of MiaPaCa-2 into nude mice. Expression of hENT1 was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. GEM cellular uptake was determined using [3H] GEM.
Significant increases in hENT1 expression and GEM cellular uptake were observed after S-1 treatment. Six different treatment schedules (no treatment, single agent of GEM or S-1, combination treatment with GEM either before, simultaneously or following administration of S-1) were compared. Significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in the mice treated with S-1 followed by GEM compared to either untreated mice or the mice treated with the other schedules.
Based on the effects of S-1 on the uptake of GEM, S-1 should be used before GEM treatment. The GEM/S-1 combination therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer may be promising and should be tested in clinical trials.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) are the primary mechanisms for repair of bulky adducts caused by chemical agents, such as PAHs. It is expected that polymorphisms in NER or BER genes may modulate individual susceptibility to PAHs exposure. Here, we evaluate the effects of PAHs exposure and polymorphisms in NER and BER pathway, alone or combined, on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA (PAH-DNA) adducts in human sperm.
Sperm PAH-DNA adducts were measured by immunofluorescent assay using flow cytometry in a sample of 465 infertile adults. Polymorphisms of XPA, XPD, ERCC1, XPF, and XRCC1 were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) techniques. The PAHs exposure was detected as urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) levels. In multivariate models adjusted for potential confounders, we observed that XRCC1 5'pUTR -T/C, Arg194Trp, Arg399Gln polymorphisms were associated with increased sperm adduct levels. Furthermore, the stratified analysis indicated that adverse effects of XRCC1 Arg194Trp, Arg399Gln polymorphisms on PAH-DNA adducts were detected only in the high PAHs exposure group.
These findings provided the first evidence that polymorphisms of XRCC1 may modify sperm PAH-DNA adduct levels and may be useful biomarkers to identify individuals susceptible to DNA damage resulting from PAHs exposure.
The purpose of this research has been to assess the role of lipidic peroxides, the involvement of the superoxide radical and of sulfhydrylic groups in isoproterenol-induced myocardium hypertrophy in rats. The results of our investigations point to increased values by 25% of plasma lipidic peroxides and in the myocardium and to a decrease of sulfhydrylic groups and of superoxide dismutase in the groups with myocardial hypertrophy, 15% and 10% respectively, compared to the controls. The comparative analysis of the data enabled us to infer the consequences of lipidic peroxides and of free radicals presence in excess and to assess the protector role of fosfobion- an energising compound-against the structural lesions of the myocyte.
In the present study, we investigated the in vivo effects of melatonin on SAH-induced cerebral vasospasm and oxidative stress, resulting from SAH in an experimental rat model. Twenty-eight rats (225-250 g) were divided into four groups equally: group 1; control, group 2; SAH, group 3; SAH plus placebo, and group 4; SAH plus melatonin. We used double haemorrhage method for SAH groups. Beginning 6 h after SAH, 20 mg/kg melatonin or equal volume of 0.9% saline was administered intraperitoneally twice daily for 5 days to groups 3 and 4, respectively. Melatonin or 0.9% saline injections were continued up to fifth day after SAH and rats were sacrificed at the end of this period. Brain sections at the level of the pons were examined by light microscopy. The lumen diameter and the vessel wall thickness of basilar artery were measured using a micrometer. The serum levels of cerebral vasodilator nitric oxide (NO), the brain levels of an intrinsic antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a NO regulator arginase activities were measured. The brain levels of inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine, a nitrosative stress parameter immunohistochemiacally determined. In conclusion, melatonin administration ameliorated cerebral vasospasm by increasing serum NO level and decreasing the brain the levels of arginase and oxidative stress. It is therefore possible that increased brain arginase activity after SAH may also have a significant role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm by limiting the availability of arginine for NO production.
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, a serious neurotoxicity, may develop rarely in patients receiving tacrolimus. Because the underlying etiology of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is vasogenic edema, it is generally accepted to be a reversible neurologic condition. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging techniques enable detection of the type of edema, and they are widely used in the differential diagnosis and prognostic prediction of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Presented here is a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in which the patient recovered completely, despite radiologic findings indicating the coexistence of vasogenic and cytotoxic edema secondary to tacrolimus therapy after liver transplantation.
Chronic aerobic exposure of A549 human lung carcinoma cell cultures to 0.1 mM L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine and 1 mM misonidazole, or 1 mM SR-2508 results in inhibition of cell growth and decreased clonogenic survival. These patterns are not apparent with the individual drug treatments. Both parameters demonstrate maximum toxicity after 72 hr in culture, which parallels the time required to deplete A549 cells of glutathione with 0.1 mM L-BSO under these growth conditions. Toxicity appears to be related to hydrogen peroxide-produced during 1 electron reduction of the nitro compounds in the presence of oxygen. A549 cells have a lowered capacity to reduce peroxide due to the effect of thiol depletion on the enzymes GSH-peroxidase and GSH-S-transferase, which require the tripeptide as a substrate. The addition of catalase, another important enzyme involved in peroxide reduction, partially reverses the observed toxicity. 4-Hydroxypyrazole, which inhibits endogenous catalase activity, causes an increase in the observed cytotoxicity. Similar effects of L-BSO and 4-hydroxypyrazole are seen for toxicity due to hydrogen peroxide being added directly to cell cultures.
Moebius syndrome is a rare disease characterized by congenital facial paralysis and abducens palsy. Involvement of other cranial nerves, orofacial dysmorphism, and limb abnormalities are frequently associated. Reported here is the case of a 10-month-old child born with Moebius syndrome and presenting with holoprosencephaly, following exposure in utero to misoprostol. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report describing this association. The etiologic hypotheses of Moebius syndrome are also discussed.
1 The anti-hypertensive effects of intravenously and intracisternally administered (+/-)-propranolol were studied in anaesthetized dogs with acute neurogenic (sino-aortic denervation) hypertension. The animals were pretreated 7 days earlier with intracisternally administered 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT 200 microgram/kg plus desipramine 5 mg/kg i.v.). 2 5,7-DHT (plus desipramine) failed to decrease both basic blood pressure and heart rate measured before sino-aortic denervation. After 5,7-DHT (plus desipramine) pretreatment, acute sino-aortic denervation induced a rise in blood pressure and stimulated the heart rate, these effects being similar (in intensity and duration) to those observed in control (saline-pre-treated) debuffered dogs during the first hour following the deafferentation. 3 In debuffered dogs, (+/-)-propranolol given by intracisternal (50 microgram/kg) or intravenous (300 microgram/kg) routes decreased both blood pressure and heart rate. 4 5,-DHT (plus desipramine) pretreatment abolished the antihypertensive effect of intracisternal propranolol whereas the action of intravenous propranolol was only delayed. In contrast, this pretreatment failed to reduce and even sometimes enhanced the negative chronotropic response induced by propranolol. 5 These results suggest that central 5-hydroxytryptaminergic pathways play an important role in the acute hypotension elicited by intracisternal (+/-)-propranolol in debuffered hypertensive anaesthetized dogs, but little, if any in propranolol-induced bradycardia.
Tetrahydroisoquinolines present in the mammalian brain, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) and salsolinol, suspected to cause neurodegeneration leading to Parkinson's disease, were investigated to find their possible physiological role. To this aim their behavioral and receptor effects induced after a single dose were tested in mice and rats. Both compounds do not affect significantly the basal locomotor activity, very effectively block hyperactivity induced by apomorphine (rats) and amphetamine (mice), only partially block hyperactivity induced by scopolamine, do not affect locomotor stimulation induced by cocaine, and strongly augment the running fit induced by morphine (mice). They do not produce extrapyramidal symptoms and do not potentiate haloperidol-induced catalepsy (rats). TIQ and salsolinol do not displace antagonists of several receptors (including D(1) and D(2)) from their binding sites, but displace the agonists of Alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, [(3)H]clonidine and of dopamine receptors, [(3)H]apomorphine. The results indicate that salsolinol and TIQ act as specific antagonists of agonistic conformation of dopamine receptors, and owing to that may play a role of endogenous feed-back regulators of the dopaminergic system. Those properties make tetrahydroisoquinolines potential antidopaminergic drugs devoid of extrapyramidal effects, with possible application in substance addiction disorder as anti-craving agents.
In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study we evaluated the safety and kinetics of a new narcotic antagonist, nalmefene, after 2, 6, 12, and 24 mg intravenous doses to healthy men. At each dose level four subjects received active drug and two received placebo. The drug was well tolerated at all dose levels with only mild and transient side effects, the most common of which was lightheadedness. The plasma concentration-time data were best fit with a triexponential equation, and the terminal elimination phase had a harmonic mean t1/2 of 8 to 9 hours. Only about 5% of the dose was excreted in the urine as intact nalmefene, with up to 60% excreted as nalmefene glucuronide. Although intersubject differences were noted, mean or dose-normalized mean kinetic parameters such as clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, terminal t1/2, and AUC showed no consistent trends related to increasing doses, indicating that nalmefene has linear pharmacokinetics.
Recent epidemiologic studies have associated nut consumption with a reduced incidence of cardiovascular mortality. However, little is known about the contribution of nut polyphenols to antioxidant and cardiovascular protection. In this investigation, polyphenol-rich extracts from English walnuts (Juglans regia) were studied and compared with ellagic acid for their ability to inhibit in vitro plasma and LDL oxidation, as well as their effects on LDL alpha-tocopherol during oxidative stress. In addition, the Trolox equivalent antioxidant activity (TEAC) was determined and liquid chromatography electrospray detection mass spectrometry (LC-ELSD/MS) analyses of the walnut extracts were performed. 2,2'-Azobis'(2-amidino propane) hydrochloride (AAPH)-induced LDL oxidation was significantly inhibited by 87 and 38% with the highest concentration (1.0 micromol/L) of ellagic acid and walnut extract, respectively. In addition, copper-mediated LDL oxidation was inhibited by 14 and 84% in the presence of ellagic acid and walnut extract, respectively, with a modest, significant LDL alpha-tocopherol sparing effect observed. Plasma thiobarbituric acid reacting substance (TBARS) formation was significantly inhibited by walnut extracts and ellagic acid in a dose-dependent manner, and the extracts exhibited a TEAC value greater than that of alpha-tocopherol. LC-ELSD/MS analysis of the walnut extracts identified ellagic acid monomers, polymeric ellagitannins and other phenolics, principally nonflavonoid compounds. These results demonstrate that walnut polyphenolics are effective inhibitors of in vitro plasma and LDL oxidation. The polyphenolic content of walnuts should be considered when evaluating their antiatherogenic potential.
Systemic alkalinization is recommended for resuscitation from local anesthetic-induced cardiotoxicity. It has been suggested that inducing hypocapnic alkalosis, prior to exposure to toxic concentrations of local anesthetics, may minimize cardiotoxicity. However, it remains unclear whether inducing severe hypocapnic alkalosis after administration of local anesthetics will minimize the duration of bradycardia. We used isolated rat hearts to investigate the effects of hypocapnic alkalosis on heart rate (HR) recovery from bupivacaine or levobupivacaine-induced bradycardia.
We measured the time required for the HR in 24 isolated rat hearts, respectively, to attain 90% of the baseline HR (recovery time) following bradycardia induced by 1 microg x mL(-1) and 10 microg x mL(-1) concentrations of either bupivacaine or levobupivacaine. Normal pH perfusate (bupivacaine or levobupivacaine with normal pH washout groups) or severe hypocapnic alkalosis perfusate (bupivacaine or levobupivacaine with hypocapnic alkalosis washout groups) were reperfused after exposure to the local anesthetics.
Severe hypocapnic alkalosis prolonged the recovery time from 273 +/- 122 sec, at the 1 microg x mL(-1) bupivacaine concentration with normal pH washout, to 1203 +/- 540 sec, in the bupivacaine with hypocapnic alkalosis washout (p = 0.029). Severe hypocapnic alkalosis also prolonged the recovery time from 1153 +/- 644 sec, at a 10 microg x mL(-1) bupivacaine concentration in the normal pH washout group, to 2065 +/- 617 sec, in the bupivacaine with hypocapnic alkalosis washout group (p = 0.032). With levobupivacaine 10 microg x mL(-1) in the normal pH washout group, HR recovery time increased from 863 +/- 186 sec to 1565 +/- 567 sec, compared to the hypocapnic alkalosis washout group (p = 0.045).
Severe hypocapnic alkalosis prolonged the recovery time from bupivacaine or levobupivacaine-induced bradycardia in isolated rat hearts. When bradycardia occurs after intravascular bupivacaine or levobupivacaine administration, maintenance of normocapnia may minimize the duration of bradycardia.
Considerable controversy exists as to whether lithium maintenance therapy is associated with the development of renal insufficiency. In 1980 we initiated a prospective study of renal function in manic-depressive patients beginning lithium therapy. None of the patients had evidence of pre-existing renal disease. Sixty-five patients were entered, and 51 and 18 patients completed 1 and 3 years of follow-up, respectively. Lithium doses were titrated to the lowest level consistent with control of psychiatric symptoms; there were no episodes of overt lithium intoxication. Serum creatinine levels in all patients, and endogenous creatinine clearance in women, remained stable over the course of the study. In contrast, creatinine clearances (mean +/- SEM, ml/min/1.73 m2) in men significantly decreased over both 1 year (110 +/- 4 to 95 +/- 5, n = 21, p = 0.0126) and 3 years (107 +/- 4 to 80 +/- 11, n = 8, p = 0.0385) of evaluation. Although all patients demonstrated a mild reduction in renal concentrating ability after initiation of lithium, the decrease was not progressive over the course of the study. Quantitative urinary protein excretion did not change, and repeated urinalyses did not reveal any evidence of renal disease. Thus, lithium therapy appears to result in modestly reduced rates of glomerular filtration, as measured by endogenous creatinine clearance, in men receiving lithium maintenance therapy for manic-depressive illness. Whether this reduction is progressive and leads to clinically significant renal insufficiency requires further investigation.
Postprandial hyperglycemia (PPH) and intermittent hypoxia related to the sleep apnea syndrome are important predictors of cardiovascular disease. We investigated the effects of intermittent hypoxia on pathological changes in the left ventricular (LV) myocardium caused by PPH in lean mice and evaluated the influence of acarbose, an α-glucosidase inhibitor. Male C57BL/6J mice aged 8 weeks were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (8 h/day during the daytime) or kept under normoxia. PPH was induced by restriction of feeding to 1-h periods twice a day, with the restricted diet (RD) mice receiving either standard chow or chow containing 0.02% acarbose. Another group of mice were fed standard chow ad libitum (AL). Plasma glucose levels after food intake were significantly elevated in RD but not in AL mice, and glucose levels were suppressed by acarbose. Intermittent hypoxia exacerbated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis in the LV myocardium of RD mice. Superoxide production and expression of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal in the LV myocardium with intermittent hypoxia were increased in RD mice, but not AL mice. In addition, expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) mRNA was increased in hypoxic RD mice. Treatment with acarbose inhibited oxidative stress and TNF-α mRNA expression and preserved the histological architecture of the LV myocardium.
A double-blind cross-over comparison of the antihypertensive actions of alprenolol and pindolol in equipotent doses was carried out in 22 patients with moderately severe essential hypertension. No other drugs were allowed. Ten patients were in WHO grade I, and 12 in grade II. The average initial pressures, similar after both the first and second 4-week placebo periods, were 175/116 mm Hg standing and 175/109 mm Hg supine. These pressures were decreased significantly by each beta-blocking drug, and about equally in both positions. An average reduction, using both 2-month treatment periods, was -13/-7 mm Hg with alprenolol, and with pindolol it was -23/-13 mm Hg. Both systolic and diastolic normotension (less than 160/100) in the supine position occurred in 45% of the patients when treated with alprenolol and in 64% with pindolol. With diastolic normotension alone the figures were 59% and 82% respectively. Rather low daily doses of 400 mg alprenolol and 20 mg pindolol were effective; increasing the doses to the average final levels of 533 mg alprenolol and 25 mg pindolol resulted in just negligible further pressure reductions. There were no serious side effects or complete resistance. Pindolol reduced the resting heart rate significantly in spite of its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Two aspects emerging from this study have clear practical implications. The twice-daily dosage, used here purposefully, of both alprenolol and of pindolol reduces effectively blood pressure, and increases patient convenience. Heat failure was not induced even in those 12 patients with cardiac involvement, including 5 with clear-cut radiological left ventricular enlargement.
Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer, was used in combination with beta-adrenergic antagonists in a man aged 56 yr with cardiogenic shock, complicating acute myocardial infarction, who developed severe tachycardia after dobutamine administration. The patient's trachea was intubated, his lungs were ventilated, and he was started on dopamine 5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) and dobutamine 5 microg kg(-1) min(-1), titrated to a mean arterial pressure > or =65 mm Hg. He progressively became tachycardiac (>120 beats min(-1)) with a cardiac index (CI) of 1.4 litre min(-1) m(-2) despite adequate preload. Levosimendan 6 microg kg(-1) was administered intravenously over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1) for 24 h. Within 30 min, the patient's CI increased to 2.2 litre min(-1) m(-2), but the heart rate (HR) also increased from 142 to 155 beats min(-1). Esmolol 1 mg kg(-1) i.v. was administered with a consequent transient decrease in HR to 110 beats min(-1) without adverse haemodynamic effects; however, HR increased again shortly afterwards. Carvedilol 3.125 mg orally twice a day was then administered, and the dose was increased to 6.25 mg orally twice daily on the following day. Subsequently, HR decreased over time and both catecholamines were discontinued 14 h after starting levosimendan infusion. The trachea was extubated within 20 h and the patient was discharged to the ward on day 4 after admission. In conclusion, levosimendan in combination with a beta-adrenergic antagonist may have beneficial effects in patients with cardiogenic shock who exhibit tachycardia in response to inotropic agents.
This study evaluates the occurrence of permanent cerebral white matter changes and neurological abnormalities in children treated at a young age for acute lymphocytic leukaemia. Our pilot treatment protocol did not include central nervous system irradiation, but intrathecal methotrexate and high-dose methotrexate infusions followed by very intensive folinic acid rescue. We examined 12 children in complete remission and off therapy 18 months to 9.5 years after their last methotrexate infusion. They were below 5 years of age at diagnosis and therefore expected to be at special risk of neurotoxic sequelae. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging in the 11 cases thus evaluated did not reveal white matter abnormalities or other signal changes as signs of permanent treatment-related sequelae. We did not observe any pathological clinical neurological findings likely due to methotrexate.
