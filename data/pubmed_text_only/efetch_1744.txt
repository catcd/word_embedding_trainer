Heart lesions induced in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs by Doxorubicin administered i.v. according to various schedules were studied by light and electron microscopy Vacuolization of myocardial cytoplasm due to distention of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the T-tubule system and the Golgi vesicles was one of the most common findings. Myocytolysis, clumping and loss of fibrils, fragmentation of sarcomeres, swelling of mitochondria and an increase in lysosomes and residual bodies were also observed. The severity of the cardiomyopathy, quantitatively evaluated by a score system, proved to be dose-dependent. Cardiomyopathy was more severe when the treatment was given in a short period by administration of high doses than when the same cumulative dose was administered as low doses repeated for a long period. The left atrium was more severely affected than the ventricles when high doses were given, whereas it was less affected in animals given low doses. The cardiomyopathy was less severe in animals receiving the same dose in a high volume of solvent and during a long perfusion time. Threshold doses were needed both to induce the cardiomyopathy and to establish it as a progressive disease.
To determine whether isotretinoin increases the risk of depression in patients with acne vulgaris.
A case-crossover study was performed among subjects who received > or = 1 isotretinoin prescription from 1984 through 2003. Data were obtained from the Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ) and Quebec's hospital discharge (Med-Echo) administrative databases. Cases were defined as those with a first diagnosis or hospitalization for depression (ICD-9 codes: 296.2, 298.0, 300.4, 309.0, 309.1, and 311) during the study period (1984-2003) and those who filled a prescription for an antidepressant in the 30 days following their diagnosis or hospitalization. The index date was the calendar date of the diagnosis or hospitalization for depression. Cases were covered by the RAMQ drug plan and had > or = 1 acne diagnosis in the 12 months prior to the index date. Those who received an antidepressant in 12 months prior to the index date were excluded. Exposure to isotretinoin in a 5-month risk period immediately prior to the index date was compared to a 5-month control period. Relative risks along with 95% CIs were estimated using conditional logistic regression.
Of the 30,496 subjects in the initial cohort, 126 (0.4%) cases met inclusion criteria. The crude relative risk for those exposed to isotretinoin was 2.00 (95% CI = 1.03 to 3.89). After adjusting for potential time-dependent confounders, the relative risk for those exposed to isotretinoin was 2.68 (95% CI = 1.10 to 6.48).
This is the first controlled study to find a statistically significant association between isotretinoin and depression. Because depression could have serious consequences, close monitoring of isotretinoin users is indicated.
Chlormethiazole is a positive modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors used in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures. It recently has been reported to attenuate seizures engendered by acute and repeated exposure to cocaine in mice and neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine in rats. The aim of the present study was to determine whether chlormethiazole could also attenuate the discriminative stimulus effects of methamphetamine, a behavior predictive of the subjective effects of methamphetamine in humans. In Sprague-Dawley rats trained to discriminate 1.0 mg/kg methamphetamine [intraperitoneally (i.p.)] from saline under a fixed-ratio schedule of food delivery, the ability of chlormethiazole (i.p.) to (1) substitute for methamphetamine, (2) antagonize effects of methamphetamine and to (3) shift the methamphetamine dose-effect function was investigated. Chlormethiazole (18 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) partially substituted for the discriminative stimulus effects of methamphetamine when administered alone (maximum group average, 60% responses on the methamphetamine-appropriate lever). Chlormethiazole did not attenuate effects of methamphetamine when coadministered with the training dose of methamphetamine. Instead, chlormethiazole potentiated the discriminative stimulus effects of methamphetamine as demonstrated by a significant (about 2.5-fold) leftward and upward shift in the methamphetamine dose-effect function in the presence of chlormethiazole (10 mg/kg). In conclusion, the present findings suggest that there is a behavioral interaction between methamphetamine and chlormethiazole. The profile of this interaction is qualitatively different from that of methamphetamine and classical GABAergic drugs (i.e., benzodiazepines and barbiturates), suggesting the involvement of non-GABAergic mechanisms in the effects produced by chlormethiazole.
Dehydrated rats regularly develop acute renal failure following single injection of aminoglycoside antibiotics combined with dextran or of antibiotics only. Oral administration of 2,5-di-O-acetyl-D-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone protected rats against renal failure induced by kanamycin-dextran. The protective effect was prevalent among D-glucarates, and also to other saccharic acid, hexauronic acids and hexaaldonic acids, although to a lesser degree, but not to a hexaaldose, sugar alcohols, substances inthe TCA cycle and other acidic compounds. D-Glucarates were effective against renal damage induced by peptide antibiotics as well as various aminoglycoside antibitocis. Dose-responses were observed in the protective effect of D-Glucarates. With a D-glucarate of a fixed size of dose, approximately the same degree of protection was obtained against renal damages induced by different basic antibiotics despite large disparities in administration doses of different antibiotics. D-Glucarates had the ability to prevent renal damage but not to cure it. Rats excreted acidic urine when they were spared from renal lesions by monosaccharides. The reduction effect of D-glucarates against nephrotoxicity of basic antibiotics was discussed.
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) represents a key defense mechanism against oxidative injury. Hyperglycemia has been linked to increased oxidative stress, leading to endothelial dysfunction, delayed cell replication, and enhanced apoptosis. The effect of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes on HO activity, HO-1 promoter activity, superoxide anion (O*-2, and the number of circulating endothelial cells was measured. The expression of HO-1/HO-2 protein was unchanged, but HO activity was decreased in aortas of diabetic rats compared with control (p < 0.05). High glucose decreased HO-1 promoter activity (p < 0.05). Hyperglycemia increased O*-2 and this increase was augmented with HO-1 inhibition and diminished with HO-1 upregulation (p < 0.05). Circulating endothelial cells were significantly higher in diabetic rats and were decreased or increased with administration of the HO-1 inducer (CoPP) or inhibitor (SnMP), respectively (p<0.05). In conclusion, HO-1 upregulation in diabetic rats brings about an increase in serum bilirubin, a reduction in O*-2 production, and a decrease in endothelial cell sloughing.
Patients receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel also receive a significant amount of ethanol, as both products contain ethanol as solvent. Patients in our clinics have occasionally exhibited signs of alcohol intoxication immediately after paclitaxel infusion. In 2002, the Japanese government lowered the minimum ethanol concentration for the definition of drunk driving, with the threshold breath alcohol concentration (BRAC) of 0.15 mg/l. The aim of this study was to measure BRAC in Japanese outpatients treated with paclitaxel or docetaxel and to assess intoxication according to this standard. Fifty-two Japanese patients were enrolled from October 2003 to February 2004. Patient characteristics were as follows: male/female, 13/39: median age, 71 (range: 34-78); breast/lung/ovarian cancer 24/16/12; and paclitaxel/docetaxel treatment: 36/16, respectively. The mean total doses of paclitaxel or docetaxel were 178 mg (range: 107-300) and 53 mg (30-100), respectively. Breath samples were measured three times immediately following the infusion of paclitaxel or docetaxel via ethyl alcohol detector and the mean value was recorded. BRAC was detected in 20 patients (56%) with paclitaxel and in none of the docetaxel patients. BRAC was measured again 30 min after the initial measurement in BRAC-detected cases with the patients' permission. In four of six BRAC-remeasured patients, BRAC became undetectable after 30 min. There was no correlation between the total doses of paclitaxel and BRAC or between the infusion rates of paclitaxel and BRAC. In conclusion, clinicians should recognize the potential for alcohol intoxication with paclitaxel administration. Patients should be instructed to avoid driving on the day of paclitaxel administration.
Capsaicin-induced inactivation of sensory neurons has been reported to enhance metastasis of a murine breast cancer cell line, specifically enhancing myocardial metastases. Here we characterized changes in gene expression patterns in primary tumors which developed in capsaicin-treated vs. control mice. We identified a small cohort of genes (17) which all showed significant decreases in expression levels. All of the identified genes have been linked to cell growth, differentiation, and/or cancer progression. Three representative genes, Caspase-7 (an executor of apoptosis), ADAM-10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease), and Elk-3 (a transcriptional repressor of the ternary factor subfamily of the Ets factors) were further investigated. All three showed dramatic downregulation at the protein level in primary tumors from capsaicin-treated animals compared with control (vehicle-treated) animals, and their expression was also lost in cell culture. Elk-3 and Caspase-7 were not expressed in vitro in cultured cell lines, suggesting that their expression was induced by the tumor microenvironment. Loss of Caspase-7 expression can be expected to result in loss of function of apoptotic pathways. At first glance, loss of ADAM-10 expression would be expected to result in decreased invasive capability, due to loss of matrix metalloprotease activity. However, just the opposite appears to be true. We found that ADAM-10 actually hydrolyzes Substance P. Specifically ADAM-10 produces the same growth-inhibitory products from Substance P (i.e., SP (1-7)) that Neprilysin does, so that loss of ADAM-10 expression actually results in loss of production of growth inhibitory peptides from Substance P. Similarly, ADAM-10 also efficiently hydrolyzes Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide, which may act in concert with Substance P. Finally, overactivity of Ets transcriptional suppressor functions has been linked to inhibition of tumorigenesis (e.g., Erf and Mef), and in addition loss of Elk-3 expression might also be be linked to tumorigenesis via loss of its putative anti-inflammatory activities. There is anecdotal evidence in the literature to indicate that the rest of the down-regulated genes may also contribute to development of a more aggressive phenotype in this breast cancer model.
The effect of vanadium in lowering blood glucose in diabetic animals is well established; however, the exact mechanism of action of vanadium still eludes us. There are several reports from in vitro studies indicating that vanadium increases enzyme activity in insulin signalling pathways; however, these findings have not been duplicated in vivo. Glucose transporters (GLUT) have a major role to play in any glucoregulatory effects. Insulin dependent GLUT4 is a major glucose transporter present in skeletal muscle, adipocytes and heart. In the present study we found that the plasma glucose in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic animals was restored to normal following treatment with a single dose of BMOV, an organic vanadium compound, given by oral gavage (0.6 mmol/kg), similar to the response with chronic BMOV treatment. The response to BMOV by oral gavage was rapid and the animals were normoglycemic within 24 h of treatment and still demonstrated a significant effect even after 72 h. Using a specific antibody against GLUT4 we found an overall reduction in the GLUT4 in the total membrane fraction in skeletal muscle of diabetic animals. However, with a single dose of BMOV the GLUT4 level was restored to normal. This is the first report that establishes a direct effect of vanadium on the regulation of GLUT4 expression in diabetic animals in vivo, and may at least partially explain the glucoregulatory effects of vanadium.
The aim of the study was to assess the effects of carvedilol, a vasodilating nonselective beta-blocker, on the indexes of left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction in those with left ventricular dysfunction.
Forty-nine patients with predischarge left ventricular ejection fraction <45% after acute myocardial infarction were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study (selected from the database of the Carvedilol Heart Attack Pilot Study: CHAPS). Patients received medication after thrombolysis and continued to do so for 6 months. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before discharge (7 to 10 days after admission) and at 3 months after acute myocardial infarction. Analysis of variance showed that wall thickness opposite the site of infarction decreased from (mean +/- SD) 12.3 +/- 2.1 mm to 11.0 +/- 2.4 mm with carvedilol compared with 11.6 +/- 1.9 mm to 12.2 +/- 1.9 mm with placebo (P =.01). Left ventricular mass changed from 235 +/- 74 g to 217 +/- 64 g with carvedilol compared with 227 +/- 80 g to 252 +/- 85 g with placebo ( P =.02). Carvedilol prevented alteration of sphericity index (ratio of long and short axis of left ventricle) that changed from 1.65 +/- 0.29 to 1.66 +/- 20 with carvedilol compared with 1.58 +/- 0.33 to 1.39 +/- 0.19 with placebo (P =.02); alteration was also prevented of wall thickening abnormality at infarct site, which changed from 9.2 +/- 3.1 cm2 to 9.1 +/- 3.5 cm 2 with carvedilol compared with 10.3 +/- 3.3 cm2 to 13.5 +/- 4.6 cm2 with placebo (P =.002).
Carvedilol administered early after acute myocardial infarction results in attenuation of left ventricular remodeling in patients with persistent left ventricular dysfunction before discharge.
In this study we examined diabetes- and hypertension-induced changes in cardiac structure and function in an animal model of type 2 diabetes, the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat. We hypothesized that treatment with omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, which causes simultaneous inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, provides additional cardioprotective effects, during normal- as well as high sodium intake, compared to treatment with enalapril, a selective inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme. Fifty-two GK rats were randomized into 6 groups to receive either normal-sodium (NaCl 0.8%) or high-sodium (NaCl 6%) diet and enalapril, omapatrilat or vehicle for 12 weeks. The GK rats developed hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and overexpression of cardiac natriuretic peptides and profibrotic connective tissue growth factor compared to nondiabetic Wistar rats. The high dietary sodium further increased the systolic blood pressure, and changed the mitral inflow pattern measured by echocardiography towards diastolic dysfunction. Enalapril and omapatrilat equally decreased the systolic blood pressure compared to the control group during normal- as well as high-sodium diet. Both drugs had beneficial cardioprotective effects, which were blunted by the high dietary sodium. Compared to enalapril, omapatrilat reduced the echocardiographically measured left ventricular mass during normal-sodium diet and improved the diastolic function during high-sodium diet in GK rats. Furthermore, omapatrilat reduced relative cardiac weight more effectively than enalapril during high sodium intake. Our results suggest that both the renin-angiotensin and the neutral endopeptidase system are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy since vasopeptidase inhibition was shown to provide additional benefits in comparison with selective angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition alone.
Nephrotoxicity due to vancomycin is relatively uncommon and usually occurs in patients receiving concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside or in patients with preexisting renal disease receiving prolonged courses of therapy and who exhibited excessive serum levels. We treated a healthy young woman who developed acute interstitial nephritis and moderate reversible azotemia associated with intravenous vancomycin hydrochloride therapy.
The purpose of this thesis work was to establish an experimental mouse model for studying the pathogenesis and therapy of accelerated atherosclerosis in uremia. Uremia was induced by surgical 5/6 nephrectomy in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice and led to development of severe aortic atherosclerosis independently of BP and plasma homocysteine levels. Also, the accelerated atherosclerosis could not be fully explained by changes in total plasma cholesterol. Morphologic and biochemical analyses of aortas suggested that accelerated initiation and expansion rather than a specific uremic lesion composition characterize atherosclerosis in the uremic mice. Increased expression of inflammatory genes in aortas of uremic mice suggests that an augmented inflammatory response in the arterial wall might be an important impetus for accelerated atherosclerosis in uremia. A marked downregulation of expression of smooth muscle cell assigned genes indicates that besides intimal atherosclerosis, uremic vasculopathy in apoE-/- mice is characterized by a uremia-specific medial smooth muscle cell degeneration. Oxidative stress could also be important for the development of atherosclerotic lesions in uremia. In the mouse model, uremia led to a marked increase of titers of antibodies against oxidized LDL (OxLDL), and increased circulating levels of the oxidized phospholipid epitope EO6. Treatment with enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) almost completely prevented the development of accelerated aortic atherosclerosis in uremic mice. This effect was parallelled by reductions of aortic expression of the proinflammatory adhesion molecule VCAM-1, and plasma titers of IgM antibodies against OxLDL, and was at least partly independent of BP-lowering. To test the involvement of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in development of uremic atherosclerosis, uremic mice were treated with a neutralizing RAGE-antibody. This treatment reduced the aortic plaque area fraction by 59% in parallel with reductions of the plasma levels of the oxidized phospholipid epitope EO6, and titers of IgG antibodies against OxLDL. As opposed to rats and CD-1 mice, apoE-/- mice did not have impaired cardiac structure and function (as assessed by echocardiography, histology, gene expression analysis) upon the induction of uremia. Since the uremic apoE -/- mouse is normotensive and did not develop myocardial calcifications, it is possible that these factors may be important for the development of cardiac dysfunction in uremia. In conclusion, the mice studies by Bro et al. showed that uremic vasculopathy in apoE-/- mice, besides accelerated intimal atherosclerosis, was characterized by a uremia-specific medial smooth muscle cell degeneration. Furthermore, the studies suggested that vascular inflammation and systemic oxidative stress may explain some of the proatherogenic effects of uremia in mice. Interestingly, the accelerated atherosclerosis could be prevented by RAS inhibition, or markedly reduced by RAGE blockade, probably through anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. The new uremic mouse model has provided a tool to identify molecular responses of the arterial wall to uremia, and may help identify new approaches for treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic disease in uremia. Also, the data obtained with the mouse model provide a platform for further studies in humans.
As oxidative stress contributes to both progression and pathologic complications of diabetes and effective therapeutic strategies to prevent or delay the damage remain limited, the aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of pentoxifylline in reducing of oxidative stress. Since there is a relationship between nitric oxide (NO), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and oxidative stress, we measured the effect of this drug on these parameters in comparison to placebo.
Thirty-nine patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus were randomized in a double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to receive either pentoxifylline 400 mg four times a day or placebo for 14 days. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study. Samples were analyzed for thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) as a marker of lipid peroxidation, ferric reducing ability (total antioxidant power, TAP), EGF and NO levels.
Pentoxifylline in comparison to placebo was effective (P < 0.05) in reduction of lipid peroxidation in plasma of the patients without significant effects on TAP, levels of EGF and NO in plasma.
Adding of pentoxifylline to drug regimen of diabetic type-2 patients can be helpful. Exact mechanism of action of pentoxifylline in reduction of blood lipid peroxidation remains to be elucidated.
Hypercalcemia caused by vitamin A toxicity and its prompt response to prednisone is described. Diagnosis was difficult in this 16-year-old patient because she denied recent ingestion of vitamin A and was thought to be bulimic. Intravenous fluids and loop diuretics lowered the serum calcium and ameliorated the symptoms of nausea and vomiting temporarily. During the 10 days of this therapy the serum calcium never fell below 11.5 mg/dl. Oral prednisone was then started and produced a prompt and lasting reduction of the serum calcium to normal. Physicians should be aware of this complication in teenagers who use vitamin A for cosmetic purposes and in patients who habitually overuse vitamin preparations.
Prodrugs may be used to improve the absorption and bioavailability of certain active compounds. We have examined the ability of a novel catechol monoester of L-DOPA, NB-355 [L-3-(3-hydroxy-4-pivaloxyloyphenyl)alanine], to stimulate locomotor activity and induce dyskinesias in MPTP-treated primates. In the presence of carbidopa, a dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity over 4 1/2 h was observed following administration of L-DOPA (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg p.o.) or NB-355 (20, 40 or 80 mg/kg p.o. dopa equivalent). The dose-response curve for NB-355 was shifted to the right such that approximately twice the dopa equivalent dose of NB-355 was required to stimulate locomotor activity to the same level observed for L-DOPA. At doses matched for total locomotor stimulation over the 4 1/2-h period (20 mg/kg L-DOPA and 40 mg/kg NB-355), there was a more gradual rise and increase in the duration of motor stimulation by approximately 40% using NB-355. At these doses, drug-induced dyskinesias were less severe following treatment with NB-355 than with L-DOPA. Our findings suggest that NB-355 may be a useful therapeutic agent for increasing the duration of action of L-DOPA and reducing the severity of peak-dose dyskinesia.
A 29-year old had been admitted to our institution with acute onset of schizophreniform psychosis after 5-day administration of sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride, which had been prescribed for nicotine withdrawal in a daily dosage of 300 mg. Examination results were found to be completely normal, apart from a positive drug screen for cannabis. We hypothesize that bupropion had induced psychotic symptoms in this patient.
The aim was to determine if isolated suspended hepatocytes could differentiate between the effects of four chlorinated hydrocarbons that are hepatotoxic in vivo and four that are not. Membrane integrity was assessed by measuring alanine aminotransferase (ALT) release after 30- to 180-min incubations in vitro. From the results, the chlorinated hydrocarbons fell into three groups: tetrachloroethylene and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane were the most potent cytotoxicants; CCl4, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene exhibited intermediate cytotoxicity; and low cytotoxicity was observed with CHCl3, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and 1,1-dichloroethylene. Cytotoxicity ranking correlated poorly with the reported in vivo hepatotoxicity of these agents. The effect of adding SKF-525A on the cytotoxicity of tetrachloroethylene and CCl4 was also assessed. In addition, hepatocytes from rats pretreated with 2,5-hexanedione were used to determine if they were more susceptible to the effects of CHCl3, CCl4, or tetrachloroethylene. SKF-525A decreased the cytotoxicity of both CCl4 and tetrachloroethylene, whereas pretreatment with 2,5-hexanedione enhanced their effect. The effects of both SKF-525A and 2,5-hexanedione on CCl4 in vitro are consistent with in vivo findings. However, tetrachloroethylene is not hepatotoxic in vivo, suggesting that SKF-525A might act by stabilizing plasma membranes rendering the hepatocyte more resistant to lysis. Overall, the results cast doubts on the use of ALT release from isolated hepatocytes as an appropriate in vitro model for assessing hepatotoxic properties of chlorinated hydrocarbons.
Acetaminophen is a widely used antipyretic drug. We describe a 64-year-old Japanese woman who developed typical Churg-Strauss syndrome after frequent use of acetaminophen. Following the ingestion of acetaminophen, she exhibited various allergic reactions such as asthmatic attacks, pyrexia and petechiae on legs. In the lymphocyte transformation test, a positive reaction to acetaminophen was detected. A muscle biopsy revealed massive extravascular eosinophil infiltration and a necrotizing vasculitis. Hypersensitivity to acetaminophen may be implicated in the development of Churg-Strauss syndrome in this case.
Bupropion is a monocyclic antidepressant structurally related to amphetamine. Zyban, a sustained-release formulation of bupropion hydrochloride, was recently released in Ireland, as a smoking cessation aid. In the initial 6 months since it's introduction, 12 overdose cases have been reported to The National Poisons Information Centre. 8 patients developed symptoms of toxicity. Common features included tachycardia, drowsiness, hallucinations and convulsions. Two patients developed severe cardiac arrhythmias, including one patient who was resuscitated following a cardiac arrest. All patients recovered without sequelae. We report a case of a 31 year old female who required admission to the Intensive Care Unit for ventilation and full supportive therapy, following ingestion of 13.5g bupropion. Recurrent seizures were treated with diazepam and broad complex tachycardia was successfully treated with adenosine. Zyban caused significant neurological and cardiovascular toxicity in overdose. The potential toxic effects should be considered when prescribing it as a smoking cessation aid.
Melittin is the main peptide in bee venom and causes both persistent spontaneous nociception and pain hypersensitivity. Our recent studies indicated that both transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) and canonical TRPs (TRPCs) are involved in mediating the melittin-induced activation of different subpopulations of primary nociceptive cells. Here, we further determined whether TRPC channels are involved in melittin-induced inflammatory nociceptive responses in behavioral assays.
The anti-nociceptive and anti-hyperalgesic effects of localized peripheral administration of three doses of the non-selective TRPC antagonist, SKF-96365 (1-{β-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenyl}-1H-imidazole hydrochloride), were evaluated in melittin tests. Pain-related behaviors were rated by counting the number of paw flinches, and measuring paw withdrawal thermal latency (s) and paw withdrawl mechanical threshold (g), over a 1-h time-course.
Localized peripheral SKF-96365 given before melittin prevented, and given after melittin significantly suppressed, the melittin-evoked persistent spontaneous nociception. Pre-blockade and post-suppression of activation of primary nociceptive activity resulted in decreased hypersensitivity to both thermal and mechanical stimuli applied to the primary injury site of the ipsilateral hindpaw, despite dose-effect differences between thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. However, local administration of SKF-96365 into the contralateral hindpaw had no significant effect on any pain-associated behaviors. In addition, SKF-96365 had no effect on baseline threshold for either thermal or mechanical sensitivity under normal conditions.
Besides TRPV1, SKF-96365-sensitive TRPC channels might also be involved in the pathophysiological processing of melittin-induced inflammatory pain and hypersensitivity. Therapeutically, SKF-96365 is equally effective in preventing primary thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia as well as persistent spontaneous nociception. However, this drug is likely to be more effective in the relief of thermal hyperalgesia than mechanical hyperalgesia when applied 5 min after establishment of primary afferent activation.
The inhibitory effect of selected membrane stabilisers on Mycoplasma pneumoniae, M. hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum was investigated in vitro. The phenothiazine chlorpromazine (CPZ) and the barbiturate thiopental (Leopental(R)) as well as the stereo-isomeric thioxanthene derivatives; cis(Z)-clopenthixol (Zu-clopenthixol(R))/ trans (E)-clopenthixol and cis (Z)-chlorprothixen (Truxal(R))/trans(E)-chlorprothixen, all have antimycoplasmal effect in the range 3.9-312 mg/l, measured as growth inhibition. It was also demonstrated that the enzymatic functions of the different mycoplasma strains, such as breakdown of glucose, arginine and urea, were abolished by concentrations of CPZ that were sufficiently low to allow multiplication of the organisms. A similar effect was obtained with Leopental(R) although the mycoplasmas were generally only half as sensitive to this drug. Also M. gallisepticum and Acholeplasma laidlawii were inhibited by CPZ and Thiopental. The four thioxanthenes were all inhibitory to mycoplasmal growth and the effect was independent of their stereo-isomeric configuration. The clopenthixol stereoisomers, but not the chlorprothixene isomers, inhibited colour change at concentrations lower than those which inhibited growth. While enzyme activity may continue for some time in vitro when classic antibiotics have inhibited mycoplasmal growth, the reverse effect was observed with phenothiazines and thioxanthenes. The membrane stabilisers may be useful tools in the investigation of microbiological activity on the mycoplasma membrane. From these drugs, new 'antibiotics' might be developed with another action than that of the known antimycoplasmal drugs.
A 58-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer suffered acute myocardial infarction during carboplatin and gemcitabine administration. This case could be cured with percutaneous coronary intervention. The possible underlying mechanisms of infarction are discussed. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of coronary artery fibrosis demonstrated by intravascular ultrasound during carboplatin-based chemotherapy after radiation of the left lung.
Opiates are commonly used to treat moderate to severe pain and can be used over prolonged periods in states of chronic pain such as those associated with cancer. In addition, to analgesic actions, studies show that opiate administration can paradoxically induce hyperalgesia. At the pre-clinical level, such hyperalgesia is associated with numerous pronociceptive neuroplastic changes within the primary afferent fibers and the spinal cord. In rodents, sustained opiate administration also induces antinociceptive tolerance. The mechanisms by which prolonged opiate exposure induces hyperalgesia and the relationship of this state to antinociceptive tolerance remain unclear. The present study was aimed at determining whether sustained opiate-induced hyperalgesia, associated neuroplasticity and antinociceptive tolerance are the result of specific opiate interaction at opiate receptors. Enantiomers of oxymorphone, a mu opioid receptor agonist, were administered to rats by spinal infusion across 7 days. Sustained spinal administration of (-)-oxymorphone, but not its inactive enantiomer (+)-oxymorphone or vehicle, upregulated spinal dynorphin content, produced thermal and tactile hypersensitivity, and produced antinociceptive tolerance. These results indicate that these pronociceptive actions of sustained opiate administration require specific interaction with opiate receptors and are unlikely to be the result of accumulation of potentially excitatory metabolic products. While the precise mechanisms, which may account for these pronociceptive changes remain to be unraveled, the present data point to plasticity initiated by opiate receptor interaction.
