Cohen syndrome is an uncommon autosomal recessive disorder whose diagnosis is based on the clinical picture of nonprogressive psychomotor retardation and microcephaly, characteristic facial features, retinal dystrophy, and intermittent neutropenia. We have refined the critical region on chromosome 8q22 by haplotype analysis, and we report the characterization of a novel gene, COH1, that is mutated in patients with Cohen syndrome. The longest transcript (14,093 bp) is widely expressed and is transcribed from 62 exons that span a genomic region of approximately 864 kb. COH1 encodes a putative transmembrane protein of 4,022 amino acids, with a complex domain structure. Homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae VPS13 protein suggests a role for COH1 in vesicle-mediated sorting and transport of proteins within the cell.
Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is an environmental pollutant and potent toxicant to humans. However, it also shows substantial anti-cancer activity in individuals with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Unfortunately, As(2)O(3)-treated leukemia patients suffer hepatotoxicity. Resveratrol has been demonstrated to have efficient antioxidant and antineoplastic activities. The study that how As(2)O(3) in combination with resveratrol affects hepatotoxicity and arsenic accumulation in the liver is lacking, and the present study tackles this question. Wistar rats were injected with 3mg/kg As(2)O(3) on alternate days; resveratrol (8mg/kg) was administered 1h before As(2)O(3). Rats were killed on the 8th day to determine histological liver damage, the antioxidant enzymes in serum, the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and arsenic accumulation in the liver. In the resveratrol+As(2)O(3) group, activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase in serum and GSH/GSSG were significantly increased, histopathological effects were reduced, and arsenic accumulation markedly decreased in the liver, compared with the As(2)O(3)-treated group. Thus, resveratrol attenuated As(2)O(3)-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing oxidative stress and arsenic accumulation in the liver. These data suggest that use of resveratrol as post-remission therapy of APL and adjunctive therapy in patients with chronic exposure to arsenic may decrease arsenic hepatotoxicity.
To examine the physiological role of the histamine H(2) receptor, histamine H(2) receptor-null mice were generated by homologous recombination. Histamine H(2) receptor-null mice, which developed normally and were fertile and healthy into adulthood, exhibited markedly enlarged stomachs and marked hypergastrinemia. The former was due to hyperplasia of gastric gland cells (small-sized parietal cells, enterochromaffin-like cells and mucous neck cells which were rich in mucin), but not of gastric surface mucous cells, which were not increased in number as compared with those in wild-type mice despite the marked hypergastrinemia. Basal gastric pH was slightly but significantly higher in histamine H(2) receptor-null mice. Although carbachol but not gastrin induced in vivo gastric acid production in histamine H(2) receptor-null mice, gastric pH was elevated by both muscarinic M(3) and gastrin antagonists. Thus, both gastrin and muscarinic receptors appear to be directly involved in maintaining gastric pH in histamine H(2) receptor-null mice. Interestingly, gastric glands from wild-type mice treated with an extremely high dose of subcutaneous lansoprazole (10 mg/kg body weight) for 3 months were very similar to those from histamine H(2) receptor-null mice. Except for hyperplasia of gastric surface mucous cells, the findings for gastric glands from lansoprazole-treated wild-type mice were almost identical to those from gastric glands from histamine H(2) receptor-null mice. Therefore, it is possible that the abnormal gastric glands in histamine H(2) receptor-null mice are secondary to the severe impairment of gastric acid production, induced by the histamine H(2) receptor disruption causing marked hypergastrinemia. Analyses of the central nervous system (CNS) of histamine H(2) receptor-null mice revealed these mice to be different from wild-type mice in terms of spontaneous locomotor activity and higher thresholds for electrically induced convulsions. Taken together, these results suggest that (1) gastrin receptors are functional in parietal cells in histamine H(2) receptor-null mice, (2) abnormal gastric glands in histamine H(2) receptor-null mice may be secondary to severe impairment of gastric acid production and secretion and (3) histamine H(2) receptors are functional in the central nervous system.
To examine the acute effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist amantadine on motor and cognitive function in Huntington's disease (HD).
Chorea in HD and in the levodopa-induced dyskinesias of PD may be clinically indistinguishable. In PD, hyperphosphorylation of NMDA receptors expressed on striatal medium spiny neurons contributes to peak-dose dyskinesias, and drugs that block these receptors can diminish chorea severity. Because these spiny neurons are the primary target of the neurodegenerative process in HD, sensitization of NMDA receptors on residual striatal neurons might also participate in the generation of motor dysfunction in HD.
To evaluate this possibility, 24 patients with HD entered a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of amantadine with two 2-week arms.
Chorea scores were lower with amantadine (usually 400 mg/d) than placebo, with a median reduction in extremity chorea at rest of 36% (p = 0.04) for all 22 evaluable patients and of 56% in the 10 individuals with the highest plasma drug levels. Improvement correlated with plasma amantadine concentrations (p = 0.01) but not CAG repeat length. Parkinsonian rating scores did not worsen and there was no consistent change in cognitive measures. Adverse event profile was benign.
Results suggest that NMDA receptor supersensitivity may contribute to the clinical expression of choreiform dyskinesias in HD and that selective antagonists at that site can safely confer palliative benefit.
Cereal grain contamination by trichothecene mycotoxins is known to negatively impact human and animal health with adverse effects on food intake and growth being of particular concern. The head blight fungus Fusarium graminearum elaborates five closely related 8-ketotrichothecene congeners: (1) deoxynivalenol (DON), (2) 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON), (3) 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), (4) fusarenon X (FX), and (5) nivalenol (NIV). While anorexia induction in mice exposed intraperitoneally to DON has been linked to plasma elevation of the satiety hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and peptide YY₃₋₃₆ (PYY₃₋₃₆), the effects of oral gavage of DON or of other 8-keotrichothecenes on release of these gut peptides have not been established. The purpose of this study was to (1) compare the anorectic responses to the aforementioned 8-ketotrichothecenes following oral gavage at a common dose (2.5 mg/kg bw) and (2) relate these effects to changes plasma CCK and PYY₃₋₃₆ concentrations. Elevation of plasma CCK markedly corresponded to anorexia induction by DON and all other 8-ketotrichothecenes tested. Furthermore, the CCK1 receptor antagonist SR 27897 and the CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365,260 dose-dependently attenuated both CCK- and DON-induced anorexia, which was consistent with this gut satiety hormone being an important mediator of 8-ketotrichothecene-induced food refusal. In contrast to CCK, PYY₃₋₃₆ was moderately elevated by oral gavage with DON and NIV but not by 3-ADON, 15-ADON, or FX. Taken together, the results suggest that CCK plays a major role in anorexia induction following oral exposure to 8-ketotrichothecenes, whereas PYY₃₋₃₆ might play a lesser, congener-dependent role in this response.
We studied the cognitive effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), by investigating epileptic patients who were seizure-free for a long time and who were undergoing fixed monotherapy. Ninety patients [27 with phenobarbital (PB), 18 with carbamazepine (CBZ), 16 with phenytoin (PHT), and 29 with valproate (VPA)] were examined by a neuropsychological battery exploring intelligence, vigilance, attention, memory, and visuomotor performances at full AED dose (T1) and compared to 28 normal volunteers. We also evaluated the effects of AED discontinuation by retesting patients 3 months after reduction at half drug dose (T2) and 3 months (T3) and 1 year (T4) after complete discontinuation. Our findings showed that patients receiving CBZ did not differ from controls at any time of examination. Patients receiving PB had significant differences only at T1 (visuomotor performance and immediate spatial memory). Patients receiving VPA showed differences in attention, visuomotor performance, verbal span and sensory discrimination tasks at T1, in visuomotor performance at T2 and in spatial span at T3, whereas no differences were detected at T4. Patients receiving PHT had a difference in intelligence and visuomotor performance at T1, in intelligence at T2, and no differences at T3 or T4. This study model is useful for investigating the cognitive effects of AED because it allows selection of a uniform sample, eliminating variables such as type, frequency, and gravity of seizures that complicate this kind of study.
Epidemiological and experimental studies provide supportive evidence that lycopene (LY), a major carotenoid from tomatoes and tomato products, may act as a chemopreventive agent against certain types of cancers. We recently showed that high-fat diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) promoted diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis in a rat model. Using this model, we investigated the efficacy of an equivalent dosage of dietary LY from either a pure compound or a tomato extract (TE) against NASH-promoted hepatocarcinogenesis. Six groups of rats were injected with DEN and then fed either Lieber-DeCarli control diet or HFD with or without LY or TE for 6 weeks. Results showed that both LY and TE supplementations significantly decreased the number of altered hepatic foci expressing the placental form of glutathione S-transferase in the livers of HFD-fed rats. This was associated with significantly lower proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive hepatocytes and cyclinD1 protein, as well as decreased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and nuclear NF-kappaB. Although both LY and TE supplementations reduced HFD-induced lipid peroxidation in the livers, we observed significantly decreased cytochrome P450 2E1, inflammatory foci and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12) in the HFD+TE fed group but increased nuclear NF-E2-related factor-2 and heme oxygenase-1 proteins in the HFD+LY fed group, relative to HFD feeding alone. These data indicate that LY and TE can inhibit NASH-promoted hepatocarcinogenesis mainly as a result of reduced oxidative stress, which could be fulfilled through different mechanisms.
Several next-generation nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are currently in clinical development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. However, the efficacy of newer agents against lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) has not been fully explored. To investigate this in vitro, we generated novel stable cell lines expressing HBV encoding the four major patterns of lamivudine resistance mutations (rtL180M+rtM204V, rtV173L+rtL180M+rtM204V, rtM204I and rtL180M+ rtM204I). Using these cell lines, we assessed the susceptibility of all four strains of lamivudine-resistant HBV to eleven nucleoside analogues in various stages of clinical development. Our studies indicate that lamivudine-resistant HBV remain sensitive to acyclic phosphonate nucleotides (adefovir, tenofovir, and alamifovir), have reduced susceptibility to entecavir, and have high-level cross-resistance to all L-nucleosides tested including emtricitabine, telbivudine, clevudine, and torcitabine.
To investigate whether PTEN can augment doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in PTEN-null Ishikawa cells. We previously demonstrated that Ishikawa cells do not possess functional PTEN protein because of protein truncations. Clones expressing the steady-state level of the PTEN protein from PTEN-null Ishikawa cells have been established and were used in this study. Doxorubicin is a commonly used anticancer drug in endometrial carcinoma. The cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin was evaluated using the methyl thiazoleterazolium (MTT) assay. We used the Hoechst 33258 staining to confirm the induction of apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the effects of doxorubicin on phosphorylation of Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (Bad) and protein kinase B (Akt/PKB). Doxorubicin induced death of all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, but the death was more significant in PTEN-expressing clones than in parent Ishikawa cells. A low concentration of doxorubicin (0.1 muM) did not affect apoptosis in PTEN-null Ishikawa cells, but it induced apoptosis in PTEN-expressing clones. A high concentration (1 microM) induced apoptosis in all cell lines, but the percentages of apoptotic cells were higher in PTEN-expressing clones than in parent Ishikawa cells. In the clones, phospho-Akt/PKB and phospho-Bad (Ser-136) were downregulated. Doxorubicin reduced the levels of phospho-Akt/PKB and phospho-Bad (Ser-136) in all the cell lines, but the reduction was most significant in the PTEN-expressing clones. Our present results indicate that PTEN transfection significantly enhances doxorubicin chemosensitivity through effective induction of apoptosis by downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/PKB signaling pathway in Ishikawa cells.
The toxicity of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), flame-retardant components, was characterized in offspring from Wistar Han dams exposed by gavage to a PBDE mixture (DE71) starting at gestation day 6 and continuing to weaning on postnatal day (PND) 21. Offspring from the dams underwent PBDE direct dosing by gavage at the same dose as their dams from PND 12 to PND 21, and then after weaning for another thirteen weeks. Liver samples were collected at PND 22 and week 13 for liver gene expression analysis (Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array). Treatment with PBDE induced 1,066 liver gene transcript changes in females and 1,200 transcriptional changes in males at PND 22 (false discovery rate < 0.01), but only 263 liver transcriptional changes at thirteen weeks in male rats (false discovery rate < 0.05). No significant differences in dose response were found between male and female pups. Transcript changes at PND 22 coded for proteins in xenobiotic, sterol, and lipid metabolism, and cell cycle regulation, and overlapped rodent liver transcript patterns after a high-fat diet or phenobarbital exposure. These findings, along with the observed PBDE-induced liver hypertrophy and vacuolization, suggest that long-term PBDE exposure has the potential to modify cell functions that contribute to metabolic disease and/or cancer susceptibilities.
Three patients developed the sudden onset of total blindness several months after treatment with oral CCNU and low-dose whole-brain radiation. The anterior visual system was included in the radiation field in all patients. Radiotherapy was given for a frontal-lobe glioblastoma multiforme, for central nervous system prophylaxis in a patient with oat cell carcinoma of the lung, and for a parietal-lobe glioblastoma multiforme. None of the neoplasms involved the anterior visual system. The radiation dose ranged from 3000 to 4650 rad and the oral CCNU dosage from 300 mg to 1050 mg. Patients 1 and 2 also received other chemotherapeutic agents. Patient 3 who was treated only with oral CCNU and cranial irradiation died. At autopsy the brain showed a widely infiltrating residual high-grade glioma as well as patchy coagulative necrosis with swollen axons and dystrophic calcifications. The optic chiasm showed severe demyelination, axonal loss, and hyalinized vessels. Synergism between oral CCNU and radiation may account for the blindness produced.
A combination of doxorubicin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) has been proven to be very effective in the perfusional treatment of advanced soft tissue limb sarcoma both in terms of tumor necrosis and limb conservative surgery rate. Unfortunately, in some patients a grade IV limb reaction has been recorded. The key solution might be the use of liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) because the carrier seems to release the drug preferentially in the tumor rather than in the healthy tissue.
Twenty patients were treated with Caelyx: 14 with Caelyx alone and 6 in combination with a low TNFalpha dose (1 mg). In the first series of 14 patients a dose escalation study was carried out starting from a dose of 10 mg/L of limb volume. Six patients were treated with Caelyx (16 mg) and TNFalpha (1 mg).
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 16 mg/L as in two patients treated with 18 mg/L a grade IV limb reaction was observed. Tumor response was satisfactory and conservative surgery was carried out in 13 patients. In 6 patients treated with Caelyx and TNFalpha, only a grade I limb reaction was recorded, thus, confirming that TNFalpha did not increase toxicity, at least at a dose of 1 mg. The Caelyx-TNFalpha combination did increase treatment efficacy. Tumor necrosis > or = 70% was observed in 4 out of 6 patients, one with 100% necrosis (pathological complete response). All the patients underwent conservative surgery.
The Caelyx-TNFalpha combination was proven to increase the efficacy of Caelyx alone, with a very low toxicity. These preliminary results have to be tested in a larger patient population.
Adenosine is an endogenous compound that may have analgesic effects. Results from clinical trials are not consistent, however, and there is a need for large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled studies to clarify the role of adenosine in the treatment of pain states, including acute nociceptive pain and pain involving central sensitization.
The analgesic and antihyperalgesic effect of systemic adenosine on the heat/capsaicin sensitization model of experimental pain was investigated in 25 healthy human volunteers. Sensitization was produced by heating the skin to 45 degrees C for 5 minutes, followed by a 30-minute application of 0.075% capsaicin cream, and maintained by periodically reheating the sensitized skin to 40 degrees C for 5 minutes at 40-minute intervals. Subjects received intravenous adenosine 60 microg/kg/min or saline for 85 minutes. Areas of secondary hyperalgesia to von Frey hair and brush stimulation, heat-pain detection thresholds (HPDTs) in normal and sensitized skin, and painfulness of stimulation with 45 degrees C for 1 minute (LTS) in normal skin were quantified before, during, and after study drug infusion.
Systemic adenosine had no effect on the area of secondary hyperalgesia to von Frey hair or brush stimulation, HPDT in normal or sensitized skin, or painfulness of LTS in normal skin.
We conclude that adenosine has no effect on acute nociceptive pain induced by heat stimulation or on secondary hyperalgesia induced by heat/capsaicin sensitization in healthy volunteers.
A 51-year-old man developed pemphigus vulgaris, minimal change nephropathy and acute tubular necrosis after 11 months of treatment with penicillamine for rheumatoid arthritis associated with features of Reiter's syndrome. Penicillamine is a polyclonal B lymphocyte activator in animals and precipitates a variety of autoimmune reactions in man. The pathogenesis of minimal change nephropathy is obscure, but our observations support the possibility that autoimmune mechanisms play a role.
Exposure of pregnant rats to morphine, from day 11 to day 18 of gestation, was previously reported to induce both an adrenal atrophy and hypoactivity of the glucocorticoid function in newborns at term, but did not affect, in vitro, the responsiveness of those glands to adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) concerning corticosterone release. Moreover, these effects were mediated by maternal hormones from the adrenal glands. In the present work, we investigated the effects of a prenatal morphine exposure on the mineralocorticoid activity of the adrenals in neonates. The first aim of the present study was to determine in these newborns 1) the adrenal and plasma aldosterone concentrations at birth time and during the early postnatal period 2) the plasma levels of Na+ and K+ at birth time, 3) the in vitro responsiveness of the newborn adrenals to angiotensin II (A(II)) and ACTH. The second aim of our study was to investigate the mineralocorticoid activity of the adrenals in newborns from adrenalectomized mothers treated with morphine during gestation. According to present data morphine given to intact mothers induced in newborns a severe adrenal atrophy but increased adrenal aldosterone content and plasma aldosterone level. However, prenatal morphine was unable to affect significantly Na+/K+ ratio in both mothers and newborns. In vitro, the adrenals of neonates from morphine-treated mothers were unresponsive to An and ACTH for promoting aldosterone release; in contrast, aldosterone secretion was significantly stimulated by high potassium levels (55 mEq). Maternal adrenalectomy performed one day before the beginning of morphine treatment prevented morphine-induced adrenal atrophy but was unable to affect significantly the adrenal mineralocorticoid function of the offspring. Such data suggest that a prenatal morphine exposure stimulated both aldosterone synthesis and release in neonates. However, this basal hyperfunction did not appear to be coupled with an enhanced adrenal responsivity to AII or ACTH. Prenatal morphine-induced hyperactivity of the mineralocorticoid function of the newborn adrenals, which drastically contrast with hypoactivity of the glucocorticoid one, was independent of adrenal factors from maternal origin.
To investigate the expression of four subtypes of E-series prostaglandin (EP(1) -EP(4) ) receptors and the urodynamic effects of an EP(4) receptor antagonist (AH23848) in cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced overactive bladder (OAB) in rats, as intravesical prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2) ) induces OAB via activation of EP receptors and sensitization of afferent nerves.
Experimental and control rats were injected with CYP (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or saline, respectively. Continuous cystometrograms (CMGs) were performed 48 h after CYP or saline injection under urethane anaesthesia. AH23848 was given intravenously at doses of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg. The bladder was then harvested for histology. Some bladders were harvested for analysis of EP receptors expression by Western blotting without a CMG study. CMG variables (baseline pressure; intercontraction interval [ICI], pressure threshold [PT], contraction amplitude) and histological changes were measured.
CYP-induced up-regulation of EP(4) receptor (100% increase) accompanied by detrusor overactivity (ICI 70.5% decrease; PT, 67.7% increase). However, CYP down-regulated EP(1) receptor expression (51.9% decrease), but had no significant effects on the EP(2) and EP(3) receptors. AH23848 significantly extended the ICI in CYP-treated rats but it had no effects on other urodynamic variables or in control rats.
Modulation of EP receptors plays a role in CYP-induced OAB. Antagonists to the EP(4) receptor may be a new target for treatment of patients with OAB.
Delirium may present with hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed clinical pictures. The signs of hypoactive delirium are lethargy, confusion, apathy, hypersomnia, muttering, difficulty in maintaining attention, and difficulty in understanding and performing commands. Valproate is commonly used for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorders. It is also used for the management of alcohol withdrawal delirium and agitative-aggressive deliriums. However, few reports are available about the valproate-induced delirium. In this report, we present a 46 years-old woman with bipolar disorder for 14 years. During her last two hospital admissions, she had been diagnosed with manic episode with psychotic features and she had received valproate. She experienced three hypoactive delirium episodes lasting 2-3 days throughout the treatment period of first week. The patient predominantly had the following signs; vomiting, hypersalivation, confusion, drowsiness, dysphasia, and hypoactivity. At the first day of delirium episode, serum valproate level was found to be within the therapeutic range (98.4, 117.1, and 65.6 mug/ml; respectively). In addition, she had normal results of cranial MRI, complete blood count, urine analysis, electrocardiogram, ALT, AST, albumin, bilirubin, BUN, creatinine and electrolytes. The serum ammonia level of the patient could not been measured due to limitations of laboratory facilities. The patient's consciousness improved dramatically 2-3 days after cessation of valproate. In conclusion, valproate can induce delirium at therapeutic blood levels in some patients via various mechanisms and this side effect has to be considered during valproate use.
As antiretroviral therapy has improved life expectancy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the life-limiting complication of HIV-related pulmonary hypertension has come into focus. Inhalation of the stable prostacyclin analogue iloprost is an effective treatment for various forms of precapillary pulmonary hypertension. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled iloprost in HIV-related pulmonary hypertension. In eight patients with severe pulmonary hypertension related to HIV infection, right heart and femoral artery catheterisation were performed. The acute effect of oxygen, inhaled nitric oxide and aerosolised iloprost was investigated. Four patients underwent long-term treatment with inhaled iloprost. The rank order of pulmonary vasodilatory potency was iloprost>NO>O2, with a maximum reduction (mean +/- SEM) in pulmonary vascular resistance of 30.6 +/- 3.1% (p < 0.001), 5.9 +/- 3.9% and -0.6 +/- 3.9%, respectively. Concomitantly, inhaled iloprost significantly increased the cardiac index and central venous oxygen saturation. Chronic treatment with inhaled iloprost tended to improve the 6 min walking distance and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance in all patients (although not significantly). No serious adverse events and no major interactions with the ongoing antiretroviral therapy were noted. In conclusion, inhaled iloprost is a potent pulmonary vasodilator in human immune deficiency virus-related pulmonary hypertension. Future studies are warranted to confirm the encouraging long-term beneficial results observed in the present limited number of patients.
A single dose (15mg/kg) of the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin was administered intravenously to 4 purebred 5-month old beagles. Six 24-hour creatinine, urea, phosphate, sodium, and potassium clearances were performed, three before and three after gentamicin infusions, as were hematology and urinalysis. Animals were necropsied on the fourth day after drug infusion. Renal clearances tended to decrease. Light microscopy revealed no significant renal lesions, but transmission electron microscopy demonstrated increased cytosomes with myeloid figures (cytosegresomes) in the proximal tubule cells of treated dogs. These structures are characteristic markers of gentamicin. therapy. In addition, the proximal tubules of treated dogs contained single membrane limited vesicles with granular proteinaceous material; a structure not previously reported to be associated with aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. The significance and relationship of these vesicles to the pathogenesis of gentamicin toxic nephropathy is not known. This study suggests that a single moderate dose of gentamicin is nephrotoxic in the beagle as judged by functional and morphological criteria.
The dose-response relationship for the induction of micronuclei (MN) and the impact of glutathione (GSH) detoxication on naphthalene-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were investigated in human TK6 cells. TK6 cells were exposed to 10 concentrations ranging from 0.0625 to 30μM naphthalene in the presence of β-naphthoflavone- and phenobarbital (βNP/PB)-induced rat liver S9 with a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-generating system. Three approaches were used to identify a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for naphthalene-induced genotoxicity: (1) laboratory criteria of ≥ twofold increase over the concurrent solvent controls (NOEL = 10μM), (2) ANOVA with Bonferroni correction (NOEL = 2.5μM), and (3) the benchmark dose approach (BMCL(10) = 3.35μM). The NOEL and point of departure micronucleus frequency for naphthalene-induced MN are between the tested naphthalene concentrations of 2.5-10.0μM in this experimental system. Supplementation of the exposure system with physiological relevant concentrations of 5mM GSH eliminated naphthalene-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity; no increased cytotoxicity or genotoxicity was observed at concentrations of up to 500μM naphthalene in the presence of GSH compared with 2.5-10.0μM in the absence of GSH. Naphthalene bioactivation by βNP/PB-induced rat liver S9 exhibits a nonlinear dose-response for the induction of MN in TK6 cells with a NOEL of 2.5-10μM that in the presence of GSH is shifted upward greater than 50- to 200-fold. These data demonstrate a nonlinear dose-response for naphthalene-induced genotoxicity that is eliminated by GSH, and both observations should be considered when assessing human risk from naphthalene exposures.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), like benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), are ubiquitous environmental pollutants formed by the incomplete combustion of organic materials. The tripeptide glutathione (GSH) is a major antioxidant and is important in detoxification of PAH metabolites. Mice null for the modifier subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclm), the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, have decreased GSH concentrations. We investigated the effects of Gclm deletion alone on male fertility and spermatogenesis and its effect on the sensitivity of male embryos to the transplacental testicular toxicity of BaP. Gclm-/- males had dramatically decreased testicular and epididymal GCL enzymatic activity and total GSH concentrations compared with Gclm+/+ littermates. Ratios of reduced to oxidized GSH were significantly increased in Gclm-/- testes. GSH reductase enzymatic activity was increased in Gclm-/- epididymides. We observed no changes in fertility, testicular weights, testicular sperm head counts, or testicular histology and subtle changes in cauda epididymal sperm counts, motility, and morphology in Gclm-/- compared with Gclm+/+ males. Prenatal exposure to BaP from gestational day 7 to 16 was dose dependently associated with significantly decreased testicular and epididymal weights, testicular and epididymal sperm counts, and with vacuolated seminiferous tubules at 10 weeks of age. Gclm-/- males exposed prenatally to BaP had greater decreases in testicular weights, testicular sperm head counts, epididymal sperm counts, and epididymal sperm motility than Gclm+/+ littermates. These results show no effects of Gclm deletion alone on male fertility and testicular spermatogenesis and subtle epididymal effects but support increased sensitivity of Gclm-/- males to the transplacental testicular toxicity of BaP.
The present study has been designed to assess specifically the involvement of the clock gene mPer2 in morphine-induced tolerance and withdrawal. At first, we checked the absence of initial differences in the expression of several gene transcripts involved in the development of morphine dependence in Per2(Brdm1) mutant mice and in their respective wild-type (WT) control littermates. Morphine-induced tolerance as well as precipitated withdrawal was then assessed in these mice. The Per2(Brdm1) mutant mice clearly developed less tolerance and showed attenuated withdrawal signs compared to WT. These results show that mPER2 is involved in morphine-induced tolerance and withdrawal.
This prospective, parallel-group, dose-escalation study evaluated the cardiac safety of trastuzumab (Herceptin) plus epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and determined an epirubicin dose for further evaluation. HER2-positive patients received standard-dose trastuzumab plus epirubicin (60 or 90 mg/m(2))/cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m(2)) 3-weekly (EC60+H, n=26; EC90+H, n=25), for four to six cycles; 23 HER2-negative patients received EC alone (90/600 mg/m(2)) 3-weekly for six cycles (EC90). All patients underwent thorough cardiac evaluation. Two EC90+H-treated patients experienced symptomatic congestive heart failure 4.5 and 6 months after the end of chemotherapy. One EC60+H-treated patient experienced an asymptomatic decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to <50% 6 months after the end of chemotherapy. No such events occurred in control patients. Asymptomatic LVEF decreases of >10% points were detected in 12 (48%), 14 (56%) and 5 (24%) patients treated with EC60+H, EC90+H, and EC90. Objective response rates with EC60+H and EC90+H were >60%, and 26% for EC90 alone. These results indicate that trastuzumab may be combined with EC with manageable cardiotoxicity and promising efficacy.
