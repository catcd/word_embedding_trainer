We have previously shown that dietary polyethylene-glycol (PEG) suppresses the occurrence of azoxymethane-induced cancers in an accelerated rat model of colon carcinogenesis. To determine the consistency of this preventive effect, we carried out a long-term study in rats fed the standard American Institute of Nutrition 1976 diet, and 7 short-term prevention studies in rodents. A total of 337 F344 rats, 20 Sprague Dawley rats, and 40 OF1 mice were all given initiating dose(s) of colon carcinogen, and were randomly allocated to experimental groups 7 d later. Treated groups received drinking water containing 5% PEG. After 30 or 162 d, the animals were examined for aberrant crypt foci or tumors in the colon. After two 20 mg/kg azoxymethane injections, the number of F344 rats with colon tumor was lower in rats receiving PEG for 162 d than in carcinogen-injected controls, 5/21 versus 25/27 (P < 0.0001). PEG-fed rats had no invasive cancer, and 10 times fewer colon tumors than controls (0.3+/-0.1 and 3.1+/-0.5 respectively, P < 0.0001). A three-day PEG treatment was sufficient to halve the number of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in F344 rats (P = 0.0006). After 16 d of treatment, PEG-fed rats had five times fewer foci than controls (21+/-14 and 100+/-23 respectively, P < 0.0001), but the inhibition was reversible in part when treatment was discontinued. Aberrant crypt foci initiated by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea intra-rectally (40 mg/kg) or by 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline p.o. (2 x 200 mg/kg) were suppressed by PEG (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.003 respectively). PEG was active in F344 rats, in Sprague Dawley rats (P = 0.0005), and in OF1 mice (P = 0.001). PEGs with MW between 3350 and 12000 (but not PEG 400), and PEG 8000 from five suppliers, markedly inhibited azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci (all P < 0.01). The prevention was stronger in rats fed a high-fat diet (P < 0.0001) than in rats fed a rodent chow (P = 0.02). PEG was thus a fast, consistent, and potent inhibitor of early colonic precursor lesions. Moreover, PEG is one of the most potent inhibitors of colon tumor in the standard rat model. Since PEG has no known toxicity in humans, we think it should be tested as a chemopreventive agent in a clinical trial.
The present pilot study tested the clinical performance of a new pharmacokinetically guided dosing regimen of parenteral estrogen in patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma. The aim was to accelerate endocrine effects and to avoid cardiovascular side effects.
Seventeen patients were randomized to intramuscular injections of 240 mg polyestradiol phosphate (PEP) every second week for the first 8 weeks (five doses), followed by a maintenance dose of 240 mg every month; and 16 patients were randomized to bilateral orchidectomy. The estrogen dosing was calculated by pharmacokinetic modelling to achieve a rapid increase in serum estradiol and thereby a fast decrease in testosterone.
The predicted increment in serum estrogen was achieved, together with a subsequent decrease in testosterone in the PEP group. In addition, there were no signs of an increased cardiovascular morbidity. This was probably due to a minimal estrogenic influence on the liver and was reflected by unchanged levels of coagulation factor VII. Clinical effects, during the first 2 years of treatment, were similar in the two treatment arms, with 12 patients in the orchidectomy group and 14 patients in the PEP group responding to treatment.
The present parenteral regimen is an efficient and time-saving estrogen regimen with a favorable side-effect profile. PEP seems to offer a potential for revival of the most cost-effective endocrine treatment of cancer of the prostate, i.e., estrogen.
Standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C is with interferon (IFN)-alpha and ribavirin for 6-12 months. In dialysis patients only interferon therapy is currently used due to the lack of knowledge concerning ribavirin dosage and side-effects. The aim of this study was to investigate if ribavirin can be added to interferon when treating dialysis patients with hepatitis C. Five patients on haemodialysis and one patient on peritoneal dialysis with chronic hepatitis C, five with genotype 1 and one with genotype 4, were given interferon-alpha2b 3 MU thrice weekly for 4 weeks, whereafter ribavirin 200-400 mg was added, for an intended total treatment period of 28 weeks. Ribavirin plasma concentrations were monitored, using HPLC. Four patients completed the treatment. One patient suffered marked side-effects from interferon and therapy was terminated. One patient developed heart failure and died after 14 weeks of treatment but the death was not considered treatment related. Based on plasma concentrations, ribavirin doses were frequently adjusted initially. The target concentration (10-15 micromol/L) was reached with average daily doses of 170-300 mg ribavirin. Ribavirin induced anaemia was managed with high doses of erytropoietin (20 000-30 000 IU/week). Five of six patients became hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA negative during treatment, but four relapsed post-treatment; one is HCV-RNA negative. Hence ribavirin, in combination with IFN-alpha, can be used to treat dialysis patients with HCV. However, this requires reduced ribavirin doses and close monitoring of ribavirin plasma concentrations and haemoglobin. Ribavirin-induced anaemia can be managed with high doses of erythropoeitin.
Local anesthetic-induced cardiotoxicity remains a complication of regional anesthesia, with the potential to result in cardiac arrest refractory to resuscitation. Successful resuscitation using Intralipid (Baxter Pharmaceuticals by Fresenius Kabi, Uppsala, Sweden), has been reported in 2 patients with bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest.
We report another case for which Intralipid was used as part of a successful resuscitation in a patient with local anesthetic-induced cardiotoxicity.
Early treatment with Intralipid may help prevent cardiac arrest and speed successful resuscitation efforts.
The cause of the amenorrhea that occurs in patients with hyperprolactinemia is unknown. The involvement of endogenous opioid peptides in the inhibition of GnRH release as a central factor leading to the hypogonadotropic state has been recently described. This study analyzed the LH response to opiate receptor blockade by naloxone (4 mg, iv) in groups of subjects with amenorrhea due to hyperprolactinemia of different etiologies. Patients presenting with a PRL-secreting pituitary adenoma (n = 7), idiopathic hyperprolactinemia (n = 9), or hyperprolactinemia during pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia (n = 5) were studied. Furthermore, to evaluate whether high circulating PRL levels influence the activity of the opioid system after the menopause, a group of seven postmenopausal subjects was tested before and 1 week after the administration of metoclopramide (10 mg, three times a day), a dopamine receptor antagonist. Normal premenopausal women (n = 6) served as controls. Naloxone significantly increased plasma LH levels in both prolactinoma and idiopathic hyperprolactinemic patients (P less than 0.01 vs. basal and placebo). In neither of those groups was a significant correlation found between the plasma LH response to naloxone and basal plasma PRL levels. In contrast to pathological hyperprolactinemia, blockade of opiate receptors did not significantly change LH secretion in either amenorrheic women with pharmacologically induced hyperprolactinemia or postmenopausal women. These results suggest that the effect of hyperprolactinemia on opioid modulation of LH secretion is related to the nature of the hyperprolactinemic state, supporting the existence of increased opioid inhibition of LH levels in pathological hyperprolactinemia.
To determine the effects of terazosin on blood pressure and on antihypertensive therapy when used in managing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
Safety data from a large, multinational study were analysed retrospectively. Normotensive and hypertensive patients received escalating dosages of terazosin for 10 weeks and were maintained on 5 or 10 mg daily doses for 16 weeks (single-blind period). After the initial treatment period, only men having sufficient improvements in International Prostate Symptom Score (> or = 30%) and in peak flow rate (> or = 10%) were randomly assigned to continue terazosin or to receive placebo for 24 weeks (double-blind period).
In hypertensive patients, terazosin reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during the single-blind period; these clinically significant reductions were maintained in patients receiving terazosin during the double-blind period. However, in normotensive and controlled hypertensive patients terazosin produced no clinically significant mean changes in SBP or DBP during either study period. Terazosin did not adversely affect patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medication.
Terazosin is a safe treatment for BPH in normotensive and hypertensive men, including men who are already taking additional antihypertensive drugs.
Remoxipride and clozapine are new neuroleptics that are thought to be superior to the substances in use by their efficacy and tolerance. At the University Clinic of Psychiatry in Düsseldorf a double-blind study with 54 patients diagnosed as schizophrenic in accordance with DSM-III was conducted to record the influence of the neuroleptics remoxipride, clozapine and haloperidol on schizophrenic psychosis. The schizophrenic symptoms were rated by the AMDP-system (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Methodik und Dokumentation in der Psychiatrie), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 of treatment to evaluate the degree of change in psychopathology. The tolerance of the neuroleptic treatment was checked by the doctor's overall impression and the somatic findings of the AMDP-system. All 3 neuroleptics reduced the schizophrenic symptoms to a similar degree but showed differentiation as to their side effects.
The use of particles from micro to nanoscale provides benefits to diverse scientific fields, but because a large percentage of their atoms lie on the surface, nanomaterials could be highly reactive and pose potential risks to humans. Due to their wide range of application, Cobalt nano-particles are of great interest both in industry and in life-science. To date, there are few studies on Co nano-particle toxicology. In this respect, this study aims at evaluating in vitro the potential interference of Co nano-particles on the production of several cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFNgamma and TNFalpha) by PBMCs, comparing their effects to those of Co micro-particles and Co solution (CoCl2). Cells were cultured in Opticell flasks with escalating concentrations (10-5, 10-6 and 10-7 M), of Co nano and micro-particles and CoCl2 or without metal. Cytokines were quantified in the supernatants using a human Th1/Th2 cytokine cytometric bead array. Co micro-particles showed a greater inhibitory effect compared to other Co forms. Its inhibitory activity was detected at all concentrations and towards all cytokines, whereas Co solutions selectively inhibited IL-2, IL-10 and TNF-alpha at maximal concentration. Co nano-particles induced an increase of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma release and an inhibition of IL-10 and IL-2: a cytokine pattern similar to that detected in the experimental and clinical autoimmunity. On the basis of the obtained data, immune endpoints should be sought in the next series of studies both in vitro and in vivo in subjects exposed to cobalt nano-particles.
Deficiency of a family of three leukocyte adhesion molecules (Leu-CAM) is associated with recurrent and life-threatening bacterial infections in man. Each of the three antigens, Mo1, LFA-1, and Leu M5 has a distinct alpha subunit noncovalently associated with a common beta subunit that appears to be required for the expression of these antigens on the cell surface. To investigate the molecular basis of Leu-CAM deficiency, we studied leukocytes from four unrelated patients suffering from complete or partial Leu-CAM deficiency using immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins, RNA extraction, and Northern blot analysis. We found that B cells from all four patients synthesized a normal sized beta subunit precursor that either failed to "mature" or matured only partially to the membrane expressed form. B cells from all four patients also had a single normal sized beta subunit mRNA of approximately 3.4 kb. Leu-CAM deficiency, in these unrelated patients, is not due to the absence of the beta chain gene or to aberrant splicing of its mRNA and are consistent with a defective beta subunit gene resulting in abnormal posttranslational processing of the synthesized molecule.
The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used all over the world. Their psychiatric side-effects are rarely known. We report a case of indomethacin related depersonalization and have done a review of literature. We wanted to show the NSAIDs's side-effects. These are non specific, they can be either affective disorders, depersonalization states, hallucinations, or paranoid psychosis (which seems to be the most frequent). The symptomatology is easily suppressed, as soon as NSAIDs are stopped and/or psychotherapeutic symptomatic treatment is started. Different explanations are proposed: prostaglandin inhibition for the NSAIDs in general, indolic molecular structure (which looks like serotonin) for the indomethacin in particular which is the NSAID the most find in these side effects. There is several studies about the role of prostaglandin in psychiatry above all about schizophrenia. Some therapeutic essays were realized with prostaglandins precursors. The rest of the nosology is less studied.
A significant unresolved question is how vitamin A deprivation causes, and why retinoic acid fails to reverse, immunodeficiency. When depleted of vitamin A, T cells undergo programmed cell death (PCD), which is enhanced by the natural competitor of retinol, anhydroretinol. PCD does not happen by apoptosis, despite the occurrence of shared early events, including mitochondrial membrane depolarization, permeability transition pore opening, and cytochrome c release. It also lacks caspase-3 activation, chromatin condensation, and endonuclease-mediated DNA degradation, hallmarks of apoptosis. PCD following vitamin A deprivation exhibits increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), drastic reductions in ATP and NAD(+) levels, and activation of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) -1. These latter steps are causative because neutralizing ROS, imposing hypoxic conditions, or inhibiting PARP-1 by genetic or pharmacologic approaches prevents energy depletion and PCD. The data highlight a novel regulatory role of vitamin A in mitochondrial energy homeostasis.
It was hypothesized that prenatal exposure to cocaine and other substances would be related to delayed expressive language development. Speech and language data were available for 458 6-year olds (204 were exposed to cocaine). No significant univariate or multivariate differences by cocaine exposure group were observed. Classification and regression tree modeling was then used to identify language variable composites predictive of cocaine exposure status. Meaningful cut points for two language measures were identified and validated. Children with a type token ratio of less than 0.42 and with fewer than 97 word types were classified into a low language group. Low language children (n = 57) were more likely to be cocaine exposed (63.1%), with cocaine-exposed children 2.4 times more likely to be in the low language group compared with control children after adjustment for covariates. Prenatal cigarette, but not alcohol exposure, was also significantly related to expressive language delays.
The aim of the 18 months follow up study was to assess the frequency of anemia during IFN/RBV therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C; to manage anemia either with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO)--epoetin alpha or with RBV dose reduction and to compare the rate of SVR in patients with RBV dose reduction and with administration of epoetin alpha. Study enrolled 61 patients with chronic active hepatitis C aged 33-61 years. All patients had HCV genotype 1b. Out of them 41 were male and 20 female. Anemia (Hb <10 or >2 g/dL Hgb drop from baseline) developed in 41 patients out of 61 (67,21%) during the therapy. These 41 patients were randomized into two groups: 21 patients who received 40 000 IU epoetin alpha weekly (I group) and 20 patients in whom for managing anemia we used standard of care (SOC) or RBV dose reductions from 1000/1200 to 800/600 mg (II group). In all 21 patients of the I group the Hb level normalized without reduction of RBV dose. In this group of patients SVR at 6 months after completion of full course of treatment was achieved in 17 (66%) patients. Improvement of quality of life (QOL) was observed in all 21 patients. Out of 20 patients of II group with standard of care (SOC) 5 patients developed symptomatic anemia with fatigue and dyspnoea; RBV was stopped temporarily. In 15 patients RBV dose was reduced from 1200 mg to 600 mg for correction of anemia. In this group of patients SVR at 6 months after treatment completion was achieved in 7 (25%) patients. Lower RBV doses yield a lower treatment response in patients with HCV genotype 1. In anemic HCV-infected patients on RBV/PEG-IFN therapy, EPO maintains RBV dose and significantly improves anemia and QOL. EPO has the potential to improve adherence rate, which may in turn improve SVR.
In a cirrhotic liver, the regenerative ability and specific functions are impaired; a hepatic resection increases the possibility of postoperative liver failure. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulates liver regeneration, accelerates restoration of hepatic function, and improves fibrosis. A truncated type II transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TbetaTR), which specifically inhibits TGF-beta signaling as a dominant-negative receptor, appears to prevent the progression of liver fibrosis. We demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of adenovirus-mediated HGF and TbetaTR gene transduction after partial hepatectomy for liver cirrhosis.
Rats were treated with dimethylnitrosamine for 3 weeks, and they all had severe cirrhosis. After partial hepatectomy (10%), we injected adenovirus expressing bacterial beta-galactosidase (AdLacZ), adenovirus expressing a truncated type II TGF-beta receptor (AdTbetaTR), adenovirus expressing hepatocyte growth factor (AdHGF), or AdTbetaTR + AdHGF into the portal vein, which was followed by an additional 2-week dimethylnitrosamine treatment.
On histologic examination, fibrotic tissue had decreased in the livers of the AdTbetaTR + AdHGF-treated rats compared with rats that were treated by AdLacZ, AdTbetaTR alone, and AdHGF alone. Liver function, which included serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, improved significantly in AdTbetaTR + AdHGF-treated rats compared with all other groups. The number of hepatocytes that were positive for proliferating-cell nuclear antigen was greater (P < .05) in AdHGF alone and AdTbetaTR + AdHGF-treated rat livers than in AdLacZ- and AdTbetaTR-treated rats. All AdTbetaTR + AdHGF-treated rats survived >60 days, and AdTbetaTR + AdHGF treatment markedly improved the survival rate after a partial hepatectomy.
Our results suggest that the combination of HGF and TbetaTR gene therapy may increase the possibility of hepatectomy in a cirrhotic liver by improving fibrosis, hepatic function, and hepatocyte regeneration.
Arsenic is a human skin carcinogen. Cancer is probably a disease driven by stem cells (SCs), and SCs are likely a key target during arsenic oncogenesis. In utero arsenic exposure predisposes mice to skin cancers that overproduce cancer SCs (CSCs) and have distorted CSC signaling and population dynamics. Therefore, we hypothesized CSC accumulation may occur during arsenic-induced malignant transformation in vitro of human skin keratinocytes. Thus, the HaCaT cell line, malignantly transformed by arsenite (100 nM, 30 weeks; termed As-TM cells) in prior work, was further studied for the quantity and nature of SCs after this transformation. SCs were isolated from passage-matched control and As-TM cells by a magnetic bead system that enriches for CD34-positive cells. There were 2.5 times more SCs isolated from As-TM cells than control. Holoclone production from As-TM putative CSCs was 2.5-fold higher by 1 week and 3.5-fold higher by 2 weeks than control SCs. Potential malignant phenotype was assessed in isolated SC/CSCs. Transcript level of SC/CSC markers were elevated in both isolated As-TM CSCs and control SCs compared with parental cells, but compared with control SCs, As-TM putative CSCs had elevated CD34, K5, K14, K15, and K19 transcripts and dramatically stronger staining for p63, Rac1, K5, Notch1, and K19. As-TM putative CSCs also showed markedly elevated MMP-9 secretion and colony formation, indicators of cancer phenotype, even compared with total population of As-TM cells. Thus, malignant phenotype is particularly pronounced in CSCs after arsenic-induced transformation of human skin cells and occurs concurrently with a potential overproduction of these cells.
Isoniazid (INH), a widely used antituberculosis drug, has been associated with serious drug-induced liver injury (DILI). INH-modified proteins have been proposed to play important roles in INH DILI; however, it remains to be determined whether INH or reactive metabolites bind irreversibly to proteins. In this study, mass spectrometry was used to define protein modifications by INH in vitro and in patients taking INH therapy. When INH was incubated with N-acetyl lysine (NAL), the same isonicotinic-NAL (IN-NAL) adducts were detected irrespective of the presence or absence of any oxidative enzymes, indicating auto-oxidation may have been involved. In addition, we found that INH could also bind to human serum albumin (HSA) via an auto-oxidation pathway, forming isonicotinic amide adducts with lysine residues in HSA. Similar adducts were detected in plasma samples isolated from patients taking INH therapy. Our results show that INH forms protein adducts in the absence of metabolism.
Individual differences in coping with novelty and in the response to psychoactive drugs have been related to early life events, such as the age of weaning. Outbred CD-1 mice underwent a precocious (postnatal day (pnd) 15, Wean-15 group), regular (pnd 21, Wean-21 group), or delayed (pnd 27, Wean-27 group) weaning, and were tested as adults (pnd > 60). In Experiment 1, animals underwent a treatment history with d-amphetamine (AMPH 0, 1, or 5 mg/kg once/day for three days) in a familiar environment. On testing day, mice were challenged with SAL or a standard 1 mg/kg AMPH dose (to evaluate acute drug effects and sensitization), and placed in the familiar environment. As expected, regular Wean-21 animals showed an AMPH-induced hyperactivity and a profile of conditioned locomotion, whereas the same dosage failed to induce any change in Wean-15 and Wean-27 groups. Levels of spontaneous novelty seeking were particularly elevated for Wean-27 mice, when compared with the other weaning groups. In Experiment 2, pairing of AMPH administration (0, 1, 2, 3.3, or 5 mg/kg once/day for three days) with a distinct environment produced a classical conditioned place preference. The magnitude of the preference profile was significantly more marked for Wean-15 mice, when compared with the other two weaning groups. Both experiments also provided evidence that the development of sensitization was particularly evident in Wean-27 mice. In summary, delayed weaning was associated in adult mice with both elevated levels of novelty seeking and increased sensitization to drug effects. Conversely, animals weaned precociously were much more responsive to AMPH-induced incentive conditioning. These results appear relevant to the issue of early experiences as possible risk factors for a number of psychiatric disorders in humans, including the abuse of drugs.
Hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) suffer from excessive oxidative stress and inflammation. Vitamin D analogues are currently the first line therapy for SHP, but the influence of vitamin D treatment on inflammation and oxidative stress remains unknown. This study investigated the influence of vitamin D therapy on oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in hemodialysis patients with SHP. Twenty-five patients (mean age 58 ± 12 years, 13 males and 12 females) were enrolled in the study to receive calcitriol treatment for 16 weeks. We evaluated changes in the serum biochemical parameters, inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels], serum oxidative stress condition [total antioxidant status (TAS)], and CD4(+) T-lymphocyte intracellular cytokines [interferon γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4)] before and at the end of the 16-week calcitriol treatment. Correlations between each of these factors were also studied. All patients with SHP had low serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) levels and elevated serum levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), CRP and IL-6. Twenty patients (10 males and 10 females) responded to the calcitriol therapy, with significant decrements in serum iPTH. Our results showed that calcitriol can effectively suppress iPTH secretion, reduce inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6) and oxidative stress. It can also effectively reduce inflammatory cytokine (CD4(+) IFN-γ) and increase anti-inflammatory cytokine (CD4(+) IL-4). Interestingly, significant correlations between CD4(+) IFN-γ levels and serum iPTH levels, as well as between TAS and iPTH levels were noted. Overall, our study has demonstrated calcitriol treatment significantly attenuates inflammation and oxidative stress in hemodialysis patients with SHP.
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists combined with opioids are thought to be effective in the control of pain states. We evaluated morphine use and analgesia in 37 patients postlaparotomy. Patients received 60 mg of oral dextromethorphan or placebo the night before and again 1 h before surgery. Morphine was titrated intraoperatively to maintain blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of baseline and postoperatively via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The dextromethorphan and placebo groups were compared for morphine use intraoperatively, in recovery, via PCA in the first 4 and 24 h, and total use over the study period. Pain scores at rest and on activity for the first 4 and 24 h were also compared. Intraoperatively, the dextromethorphan group required less morphine: 13.1+/-4.3 vs 17.6+/-6.0 mg (P = 0.012). Postoperatively, there was no significant difference between the dextromethorphan and placebo groups for morphine use: in the recovery room 10.9+/-7.7 vs 12.1+/-7.7 mg; the first 4 h of PCA 15.9+/-9.3 vs 12.7+/-5.1 mg; the first 24 h of PCA 76.4+/-44.7 vs 61.8+/-27.5 mg; or in total morphine use 100.4+/-49.5 vs 91.5+/-3.1 mg. Pain scores for the two groups were not statistically different throughout the study period. We conclude that 60 mg of oral dextromethorphan given the night before and repeated an hour before surgery does not provide a postoperative morphine-sparing effect or improve analgesia after laparotomy.
Patients given dextromethorphan before surgery had significantly reduced intraoperative morphine requirements. However, postoperative morphine requirements were unaltered. Dextromethorphan may need to be continued postoperatively to improve postoperative analgesia.
Naloxone injected intrathecally had a different effect on the inhibition of the inhibition of the tail flick response produced by beta-endorphin and morphine injected intraventricularly. The intrathecal naloxone completely antagonized the effect of beta-endorphin but had only a very weak effect on morphine. In the same rats the cataleptic response to beta-endorphin was antagonized as well; however no definitive conclusion could be made regarding the antagonism of the morphine-induced catalepsy. The results indicate that spinal endorphin is involved in the production of intraventricular beta-endorphin-induced spinal tail flick inhibition and suggest that intraventricular beta-endorphin and morphine elicit their pharmacological action via the activation of different descending inhibitory systems.
To obtain further insight into the mechanism underlying the vasodilator effect of nebivolol. Since oxidative inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) is regarded as an important cause of its decreased biological activity, we studied (1) the effect of nebivolol on some oxidative parameters in essential hypertensive patients; (2) the effect of plasma of nebivolol-treated patients on reactive oxygen species production and NO availability in endothelial cells.
A total of 20 healthy subjects and 20 matched essential hypertensive patients treated with atenolol or nebivolol according to a double-blind, randomized design participated in the study. We measured low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and plasma hydroperoxides, 8-isoprostanes, oxidized LDL, susceptibility of LDL to oxidation (lag phase) and LDL vitamin E and the effect of plasma of nebivolol- and atenolol-treated patients on reactive oxygen species production and NO availability in endothelial cells exposed to oxidative stress.
In hypertensive patients, nebivolol and atenolol significantly reduced blood pressure values after 4 weeks of treatment. Plasma and LDL hydroperoxides, plasma 8-isoprostanes, plasma ox-LDL and LDL lag phase were significantly improved only in the patients receiving nebivolol compared with the atenolol group. Similarly there was a reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and O2*- concentration in endothelial cells exposed to oxidative stress after incubation of the cells with plasma of the patients enrolled in the trial only in the patients receiving nebivolol compared to atenolol group. Furthermore, the reduction of basal and stimulated NO induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells was significantly lower in the patients receiving nebivolol compared to atenolol group.
The findings of the present study indicate that nebivolol, through its antioxidant properties, increases NO also by decreasing its oxidative inactivation.
The goal of the multicenter drug surveillance project AMSP ("Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie") is the monitoring, assessment and analysis of adverse drug reactions (ADR) of psychopharmalogical drugs. We report about a 23 year-old patient with a depressive episode. He developed severe pseudohallucinations under a treatment with moclobemide. The symptoms occur 6 days after starting the medication and decline within two days after stopping moclobemide. The term "pseudohallucinations" is discussed controversially but still of high interest.
Vincristine is an anti-neoplastic agent for intravenous use. Inadvertent intrathecal administration of vincristine tends to follow a predictable clinical sequence of a progressive ascending radiculomyeloencephalopathy, usually fatal in outcome. We report a case of a 10-year-old girl who suffered an inadvertent intrathecal vincristine administration. We have outlined the management strategy used and her consequent neurological progress. She has survived but with a significant neurological deficit. Her outcome is, however, less severe than in previous literature reports; this may in part be attributable to early aggressive neurological management. This case also serves to highlight the tragic consequences of human error when handling chemotherapeutic agents of this nature.
