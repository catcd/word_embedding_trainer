Chronic pain is maintained in part by long-lasting neuroplastic changes in synapses and several proteins critical for synaptic plasticity are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Here, we show that proteasome inhibitors administered intrathecally or subcutaneously prevented the development and reversed nerve injury-induced pain behavior. They also blocked pathological pain induced by sustained administration of morphine or spinal injection of dynorphin A, an endogenous mediator of chronic pain. Proteasome inhibitors blocked mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in all three pain models although they did not modify responses to mechanical stimuli, but partially inhibited responses to thermal stimuli in control rats. In the spinal cord, these compounds abolished the enhanced capsaicin-evoked calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release and dynorphin A upregulation, both elicited by nerve injury. Model experiments demonstrated that the inhibitors may act directly on dynorphin-producing cells, blocking dynorphin secretion. Thus, the effects of proteasome inhibitors on chronic pain were apparently mediated through several cellular mechanisms indispensable for chronic pain, including those of dynorphin A release and postsynaptic actions, and of CGRP secretion. Levels of several UPS proteins were reduced in animals with neuropathic pain, suggesting that UPS downregulation, like effects of proteasome inhibitors, counteracts the development of chronic pain. The inhibitors did not produce marked or disabling motor disturbances at doses that were used to modify chronic pain. These results suggest that the UPS is a critical intracellular regulator of pathological pain, and that UPS-mediated protein degradation is required for maintenance of chronic pain and nociceptive, but not non-nociceptive responses in normal animals.
The effects of five different dietary levels of vitamin D3 on the coronary arteries of groups of 17-60 2-month old weanling Yorkshire swine were studied. Four groups were fed the following levels of vitamin D3 per ton of ration continuously for 4 months: group I--100,000 IU, group II--300,000 IU, group IV--2,000,000, and group V--4,000,000 IU. Swine in group III were fed the diet containing 100,000 IU of vitamin D3 per ton of ration for the first 2 months of the study after which they were fed a diet supplemented with 4,000,000 IU of vitamin D3 per ton of ration for the remaining 2 months of the study. The highest degree of intimal thickening of the coronary arteries was observed among group V. The thickened areas contained numerous lipid-containing cells and degenerate cells without stainable lipid. Electron microscopic examination revealed a greater frequency of degenerate cells without stainable lipid in the coronary arteries of groups III and IV than in groups I and II. These results suggest a possible link between excessive daily intake of vitamin D3 and the development of human coronary atherosclerosis.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator of intestinal inflammation. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is the main source of NO in inflammation. Because iNOS is ubiquitously expressed, our aim was to determine which cellular source(s) of iNOS plays the central role in mediating intestinal inflammation.
Chimeric lines were produced via bone marrow (BM) transplantation following irradiation. Colitis was induced with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) or trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The severity of colitis and markers of inflammation were assessed in standard fashion. Leukocyte recruitment was assessed by intravital microscopy.
The irradiated chimeric lines with iNOS-/- BM-derived cells were markedly more resistant to both DSS- and TNBS-induced injury. Resistance to DSS-induced colitis was lost when wild-type (wt) BM was used to reconstitute iNOS-/- mice. Neutrophils were the main source of iNOS in DSS-induced colitis. iNOS-/- chimeric lines had decreased colonic macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression and increased levels of the protective growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor. LPS-mediated leukocyte recruitment was reduced in iNOS-/- mice, and there were marked changes in the inflammatory cell infiltrates between the chimeric lines with iNOS-/- vs wt BM-derived cells. Furthermore, the lamina propria CD4 +ve cells from chimeric lines with iNOS-/- BM-derived cells had reduced intracellular cytokine expression.
iNOS produced by BM-derived cells plays a critical role in mediating the inflammatory response during colitis. Cell-specific regulation of iNOS may represent a novel form of therapy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Titers of circulating antigalactosyl antibodies (a-Gal Ab) were assessed by passive hemagglutination using rabbit red blood cells in 40 normal subjects, in 14 patients with immunodeficient states, in 47 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and in 15 patients with an Henoch-Sch√∂nlein disease (HS). Titers of controls ranged from 1:16 to 1:64. All immunodeficient patients exhibited very low titers (1:1). On the contrary, the existence of an enhanced humoral immune response status, as observed in RA, was not reflected by a parallel increase of a-Gal Ab titers. However, in this disease, a strong relationship existed between titers exceeding control values (greater than 1:64) and the prior occurrence of renal injury under gold or D-penicillamine therapy. Lastly, the discovery of elevated titers (greater than 1:64) in HS only when renal involvement occurred further suggests that such antibodies reflect a renal injury.
Congenital hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the retinal pigmented epithelium is an ocular lesion found in patients harboring mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene. We report that Apc-deficient zebrafish display developmental abnormalities of both the lens and retina. Injection of dominant-negative Lef reduced Wnt signaling in the lens but did not rescue retinal differentiation defects. In contrast, treatment of apc mutants with all-trans retinoic acid rescued retinal differentiation defects but had no apparent effect on the lens. We identified Rdh5 as a retina-specific retinol dehydrogenase controlled by APC. Morpholino knockdown of Rdh5 phenocopied the apc mutant retinal differentiation defects and was rescued by treatment with exogenous all-trans retinoic acid. Microarray analyses of apc mutants and Rdh5 morphants revealed a profound overlap in the transcriptional profile of these embryos. These findings support a model wherein Apc serves a dual role in regulating Wnt and retinoic acid signaling within the eye and suggest retinoic acid deficiency as an explanation for APC mutation-associated retinal defects such as congenital hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the retinal pigmented epithelium.
Parallel treatment with haloperidol and ultralow-dose haloperidol significantly increased the psychotropic neuroleptic effect of traditional doses of the drug under conditions of preliminary of simultaneous administration, which attests to a bipathic effect of this preparation. Combination of ultralow and therapeutic doses of haloperidol significantly reduced its cataleptogenic side effect.
Long-Evans, hooded rats were intubated with one of four dose combinations of pentazocine and tripelennamine on Days 7-20 of pregnancy: 0:0 (mg/kg pentazocine:tripelennamine), 20:10, 40:0, or 40:20. An additional group had free access to lab chow and water throughout pregnancy. At birth, reduced body weights were evident in all drug-treated offspring. Growth deficits were not noted at 5, 10, 15 or 20 days of age. Three measures of activity were collected at 18 days of age, however, none of these measures were differentially affected as a function of prenatal treatment. At 85 days of age, offspring were tested in a two-way shuttle avoidance paradigm. Although the number of avoidances was not significantly affected by prenatal treatment, offspring exposed to these drugs in combination had shorter response latencies than controls with increased training and made more intertrial crossing responses. Additional offspring were tested for seizure susceptibility at 100 days of age. None of the parameters of seizure activity were significantly affected by prenatal drug treatment. Prenatal exposure to pentazocine and tripelennamine resulted in prenatal growth deficits, increased activity during the intertrial interval and decreased response latencies in a shuttle avoidance learning task, suggesting that this polydrug combination may be associated with some long-term behavioral teratogenic risks.
This study aims to assess the best postoperative analgesia during maxillofacial surgery by using small doses of ketorolac or tramadol or their association and evaluates the presence of adverse effects due to NSAID or opioid use.
After their informed consent, 51 patients ASA I and II undergoing major maxillofacial surgery, were randomised in three groups and the following protocol was used: group K received ketorolac (30 mg i.v.) at the time of skin closure and repeated after 8 hrs and 16 hrs from the end of the operation. Group T received tramadol (100 mg i.v.) in the same condition; and group KT received first tramadol (100 mg i.v.) during surgery and then ketorolac (30 mg) was given in the administrations that followed. Meperidine 50 mg was used in case of unsatisfactory analgesia. Pain was evaluated using pain intensity scores 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours from the end of the operation. Data was analysed using Anova and c2 test.
The groups were comparable with regard to age, weight, duration of surgery. Very good postoperative analgesia was recorded in three groups. There is no difference statistically between K, T and KT groups in the pain scores measured. Only a low number of patients required opioids administration to achieve adequate analgesia. The patients were considered to have achieved excellent analgesia in 64.8% in T group, in 41.2% of the K group and in 58.8% of the KT group. There were no cases of insufficient analgesia. We did not find a significant difference considering BP, HR, respiratory depression in the post-operative period. Vomiting was registered in 41.2% of this T group vs 11.2% of the K group and in 35.5% of the KT group.
Ketorolac and Tramadol produced comparable, effective and low cost postoperative analgesia during maxillofacial surgery. There are only statistically significant differences considering side effects.
Sodium dichromate dihydrate is one of a number of inorganic compounds containing hexavalent chromium (CR VI) found in drinking water supplies as a contaminant resulting from various industrial processes including electroplating operations, leather tanning, and textile manufacturing. Because of the lack of adequate experimental data on the toxicity and carcinogenicity of hexavalent chromium ingested orally, and because hexavalent chromium has been found in human drinking water supplies, the California Congressional delegation and the California Environmental Protection Agency nominated hexavalent chromium to the NTP for study. In study 1, male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to sodium dichromate dihydrate (greater than 99% pure) in drinking water for 3 months. In study 2, sodium dichromate dihydrate was administered in drinking water to male B6C3F1, BALB/c, and am3-C57BL/6 mice for 3 months. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. In study 1, groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were given drinking water containing 0, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, or 1,000 mg sodium dichromate dihydrate/L for 3 months (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 5, 10, 17, 32, or 60 mg sodium dichromate dihydrate/kg body weight to rats and 9, 15, 26, 45, or 80 mg/kg to mice). On a molecular weight basis, these doses are equivalent to approximately 1.7, 3.5, 5.9, 11.2, and 20.9 mg hexavalent chromium/kg body weight per day to rats and 3.1, 5.2, 9.1, 15.7, and 27.9 mg/kg per day to mice. Additional groups of 10 rats per sex were exposed to the same concentrations of sodium dichromate dihydrate for 4 weeks. All rats and mice survived to the end of the study. Reduced body weights occurred in 500 and 1,000 mg/L male rats, 1,000 mg/L female rats, and in male and female mice exposed to 125 mg/L or greater. Water consumption by male and female rats exposed to 250 mg/L or greater and male and female mice exposed to 125 mg/L or greater was generally less than that by the control groups, and decreases in urine volume and increases in urine specific gravity in rats were related to reduced water consumption. Exposure to sodium dichromate dihydrate caused a microcytic hypochromic anemia in rats and mice, but the severity was less in mice. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were decreased in rats. Increased bile acid concentrations in exposed groups of rats may have been due to altered hepatic function. The incidences of histiocytic cellular infiltration were generally significantly increased in the duodenum of rats and mice, the liver of female rats, and the mesenteric lymph node of mice exposed to 125 mg/L or greater. Significantly increased nonneoplastic lesions (focal ulceration, regenerative epithelial hyperplasia, and squamous epithelial metaplasia) occurred in the glandular stomach of male and female rats exposed to 1,000 mg/L. Incidences of epithelial hyperplasia of the duodenum were significantly increased in all exposed groups of mice. In study 2, sodium dichromate dihydrate was administered in drinking water to groups of 10 male B6C3F1, 10 male BALB/c, and five male am3-C57BL/6 mice for 3 months at exposure concentrations of 0, 62.5, 125, or 250 mg/L (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 8, 15, or 25 mg/kg sodium dichromate dihydrate or 2.8, 5.2, or 8.7 mg/kg chromium to B6C3F1, BALB/c, and am3-C57BL/6 mice). All mice in study 2 survived until study termination. Mean body weights of 125 and 250 mg/L B6C3F1 and BALB/c mice and all exposed groups of am3-C57BL/6 mice were less than those of the control groups. Mice exposed to 250 mg/L consumed less water than the control groups. Exposure concentration-related decreases in mean red cell volumes and mean red cell hemoglobin values were observed in all three mouse strains. Erythrocyte counts were increased in exposed B6C3F1 and BALB/c mice but not in am3-C57BL/6 mice. Changes in organ weights were generally consistent with reduced body weights in exposed groups in all mouse strains. No biologically significant differences in reproductive parameters were observed in any strain. Histiocytic cellular infiltration and epithelial hyperplasia of the duodenum occurred in most mice exposed to 125 or 250 mg/L, and the incidences of these lesions were increased in the 62.5 mg/L group compared to controls. Secretory depletion was present in the pancreas of most mice exposed to 125 or 250 mg/L. The incidences of glycogen depletion of the liver were significantly increased in male B6C3F1 mice exposed to 125 or 250 mg/L and in all exposed groups of male am3-C57BL/6 mice. The incidence of histiocytic cellular infiltration in the mesenteric lymph node was significantly increased in the 250 mg/L group of male am3-C57BL/6 mice. Sodium dichromate dihydrate was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA100 and TA98 and in E. coli strain WP2 uvrA pKM101 with and without induced rat liver S9 enzymes. The results of four micronucleus tests conducted in the three strains of mice from studies 1 and 2 were mixed. In study 1, no significant increases were seen in micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes in peripheral blood samples from male or female B6C3F1 mice; there was a decrease in the percentage of polychromatic erythrocytes among total erythrocytes (an indication of bone marrow toxicity), but the changes were small and not well correlated with exposure concentrations. In study 2, a significant exposure concentration-related increase (P<0.001) in micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes was seen in am3-C57BL/6 male mice. An equivocal increase in micronucleated erythrocytes was noted in male B6C3F1 mice, based on a small increase in micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes that did not reach statistical significance. No increase in micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes was observed in male BALB/c mice. No significant effect of sodium dichromate dihydrate exposure on the percentage of polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in any of the three micronucleus tests conducted in study 2. In summary, administration of sodium dichromate dihydrate in the drinking water to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice resulted in focal ulceration, hyperplasia, and metaplasia in the glandular stomach at the limiting ridge in rats in the 1,000 mg/L group and evidence of increased histiocytic infiltration in the liver (female), duodenum of the small intestine, and/or pancreatic lymph nodes at concentrations as low as 62.5 mg/L, the lowest concentration studied. In addition, a microcytic, hypochromic anemia occurred at all exposure concentrations and was considered evidence of a toxic response resulting from absorption of Cr VI following oral ingestion in rats. A similar, but less severe, anemia was evident in mice receiving drinking water containing sodium dichromate dihydrate; histiocytic infiltration was noted in the duodenum of all three strains studied (B6C3F1, BALB/c, and am3-C57BL/6) at all concentrations employed, in the mesenteric lymph nodes at 125 mg/L or greater in the B6C3F1 strain, and at 250 mg/L in the am3-C57BL/6 strain. There was no consistent evidence of hepatocyte injury in mice in any of the strains tested. Variations in glycogen content were considered more likely related to diminished food intake than to the toxicity of sodium dichromate dihydrate. Synonyms: Chromic acid; dichromic acid; disodium salt, dihydrate; disodium dichromate dihydrate; chromium VI.
Minoxidil is a new potent antihypertensive vasodilator. Although highly effective, its use is limited by the association of the drug with pericardial effusion. We examined possible relationships in 37 patients. There was no significant effusions identified by echocardiography in 22 patients under active treatment. Retrospective review of 15 additional patients no longer under treatment identified seven who had had effusion and one who had had transient pericarditis. Resolution of effusion accompanied withdrawal in five patients; rechallenge was followed by effusion in one patient. Ninety-one episodes of pericardial disease have been reported in 1,869 experimental subjects (4.8%). Pericardial tamponade occurred in 21, with eight associated deaths. There are no specific patient characteristics that predict the likelihood of effusion. Since the reaction is both idiosyncratic and potentially fatal, it seems appropriate to continue to limit the use of minoxidil.
Cocaine is associated with an increased risk for, and progression of, clinical disease associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A human xenograft model, in which human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were implanted into severe combined immunodeficiency mice (huPBL-SCID) and infected with a HIV reporter virus, was used to investigate the biological interactions between cocaine and HIV infection. Systemic administration of cocaine (5 mg/kg/d) significantly increased the percentage of HIV-infected PBL (two- to threefold) and viral load (100- to 300-fold) in huPBL-SCID mice. Despite the capacity for cocaine to increase corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels in control mice, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was suppressed in HIV-infected animals, and corticosterone levels were further decreased when animals were exposed to HIV and cocaine. Activating huPBL in vitro in the presence of 10(-8) M cocaine increased expression of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) coreceptors. Expression of CCR5 was also increased at early time-points in the huPBL-SCID model following systemic exposure to cocaine (54.1+/-9.4% increase over control, P<0.01). This effect preceded the boost in viral infection and waned as HIV infection progressed. Cocaine has been shown to mediate immunosuppressive effects by activating sigma-1 receptors in immune cells in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with these reports, a selective sigma-1 antagonist, BD1047, blocked the effects of cocaine on HIV replication in the huPBL-SCID mouse. Our results suggest that systemic exposure to cocaine can enhance HIV infection in vivo by activating sigma-1 receptors and by modulating the expression of HIV coreceptors.
The role of beta-adrenergic agonists, such as isoproterenol, on vascular capacitance is unclear. Some investigators have suggested that isoproterenol causes a net transfer of blood to the chest from the splanchnic bed. We tested this hypothesis in dogs by measuring liver thickness, cardiac output, cardiopulmonary blood volume, mean circulatory filling pressure, portal venous, central venous, pulmonary arterial, and systemic arterial pressures while infusing norepinephrine (2.6 micrograms.min-1.kg-1), or isoproterenol (2.0 micrograms.min-1.kg-1), or histamine (4 micrograms.min-1.kg-1), or a combination of histamine and isoproterenol. Norepinephrine (an alpha- and beta 1-adrenergic agonist) decreased hepatic thickness and increased mean circulatory filling pressure, cardiac output, cardiopulmonary blood volume, total peripheral resistance, and systemic arterial and portal pressures. Isoproterenol increased cardiac output and decreased total peripheral resistance, but it had little effect on liver thickness or mean circulatory filling pressure and did not increase the cardiopulmonary blood volume or central venous pressure. Histamine caused a marked increase in portal pressure and liver thickness and decreased cardiac output, but it had little effect on the estimated mean circulatory filling pressure. Isoproterenol during histamine infusions reduced histamine-induced portal hypertension, reduced liver size, and increased cardiac output. We conclude that the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, has little influence on vascular capacitance or liver volume of dogs, unless the hepatic outflow resistance is elevated by agents such as histamine.
Stunning of the left atrium and atrial appendage is a well known but not fully clarified phenomenon observed during the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation regardless of the cardioversion method attempted.
To assess the effects of propafenone and amiodarone on left atrium and left atrial appendage contractility.
Forty patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (20 females, 20 males), aged 60-83 (mean 72.0+/-10.1) years, were enrolled into the study. Half of these patients had sinus rhythm restored by the administration of oral propafenone (150-300 mg) and the remaining 20 patients were treated with intravenous amiodarone (150-450 mg). The control group consisted of 20 patients (10 females, 10 males) aged 52-78 (mean 61.2+/-9.3) years with sinus rhythm and no history of atrial fibrillation. All the patients had a transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography performed while still in the AF, before drug administration and 1 hour after sinus rhythm restoration.
All haemodynamic parameters of the left atrium measured after the sinus rhythm restoration were significantly worse when compared with the control group. Left atrial fractional shortening and total atrial fraction were significantly lower after propafenone than amiodarone (8.6+/-3.6% vs 11.7+/-5.5%, p<0.05; and LA FC 16.2+/-5.3% vs 23.3 (+/-6.3)% respectively, p<0.05). Doppler echocardiographic parameters included in the analysis such as mitral flow and superior left pulmonary vein flow were significantly lower in the sinus rhythm restoration group than in the control group. Among them the end-diastolic mitral flow velocity amplitude and flow velocity integral as well as the maximum pulmonary retrograde velocity were significantly worse in the group treated with propafenone than in patients receiving amiodarone. All the atrial appendage Doppler velocity parameters were significantly reduced after the sinus rhythm restoration in both groups. In the patients treated with propafenone, values of these parameters were significantly decreased compared with the patients receiving amiodarone.
Successful pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation causes the left atrium and left atrial appendage contractility impairment similar to that observed with other methods of the sinus rhythm restoration. Following the AF cardioversion the level of left atrial stunning is higher in the patients treated with propafenone than in subjects receiving amiodarone.
Rats were injected with saline, 1.0 mg/kg or 2.6 mg/kg of diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP). Three days later the animals were placed in cages in which they could press a lever to obtain their entire daily ration of food. The time of day at which responses occurred and the time between successive responses were recorded over a six day period to determine the circadian pattern of lever-pressing and the distribution of inter-response times (IRTs). The saline injected rats exhibited a normal nocturnal pattern of feeding, while both DFP treated groups exhibited a significantly greater tendency to eat during the day. Analysis of the IRT distributions of the three groups showed a different pattern of results. The saline and 1.0 mg/kg DFP groups produced nearly identical IRT distributions, while the 2.6 mg/kg group produced an IRT distribution which was marked by significant increases in the interquartile range and median IRT. Since the 1.0 mg/kg dose of DFP produced a circadian disruption but did not affect the IRT distribution, it appears that the disruption of circadian activity by DFP which was reported by Raslear and Kaufman cannot be solely explained by simple changes in the motor response.
There is evidence that major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) are associated with deregulation of synaptic plasticity with downstream alterations of neurotrophins. NT3 is an important neurotrophin in the central nervous system, and performs key biological functions, such as promoting the survival, differentiation, and plasticity of neurons. NT3 has a central role in the early neuronal development; enhancing the survival of dopaminergic neurons, suggesting possible involvement in the physiopathology of dopamine related neuropsychiatric disorders such as SZ. Variations in the NT3 gene increase the risk of SZ. Three groups of chronically medicated DSM-IV patients with SZ, on treatment with clozapine (n=12), haloperidol (n=12), risperidone (n=12) and 10 healthy controls had 5 ml blood samples collected by venipuncture. NT3 serum levels were assessed using sandwich-ELISA and were significantly lower in SZ patients (p<0.005) when compared to either controls. These findings suggest that the NT3 signaling system may play a role in the pathophysiology of SZ and might be related to the course of illness or to treatment variables. Longitudinal studies are warranted.
Neural crest cells are a migratory cell population that give rise to the majority of the cartilage, bone, connective tissue, and sensory ganglia in the head. Abnormalities in the formation, proliferation, migration, and differentiation phases of the neural crest cell life cycle can lead to craniofacial malformations, which constitute one-third of all congenital birth defects. Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is characterized by hypoplasia of the facial bones, cleft palate, and middle and external ear defects. Although TCS results from autosomal dominant mutations of the gene TCOF1, the mechanistic origins of the abnormalities observed in this condition are unknown, and the function of Treacle, the protein encoded by TCOF1, remains poorly understood. To investigate the developmental basis of TCS we generated a mouse model through germ-line mutation of Tcof1. Haploinsufficiency of Tcof1 leads to a deficiency in migrating neural crest cells, which results in severe craniofacial malformations. We demonstrate that Tcof1/Treacle is required cell-autonomously for the formation and proliferation of neural crest cells. Tcof1/Treacle regulates proliferation by controlling the production of mature ribosomes. Therefore, Tcof1/Treacle is a unique spatiotemporal regulator of ribosome biogenesis, a deficiency that disrupts neural crest cell formation and proliferation, causing the hypoplasia characteristic of TCS craniofacial anomalies.
A wealth of previous studies reported pathological alterations in extrahippocampal regions in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Previous experimental findings have also demonstrated that the entorhinal cortex and the neocortex are damaged in different animal models of acute limbic seizures. The present study was aimed at verifying possible alterations in neocortical areas, and, in particular, structural changes of GABAergic interneurons in the sensorimotor cortex, in pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy in the rat. Series of sections were Nissl stained and processed for immunocytochemistry using antibodies that recognize nonphosphorylated neurofilament (SMI311), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) which is expressed by a subset of cortical GABAergic neurons, the GABA transporter (GAT1), and isoform 65 of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), the GABA synthetic enzyme. Epileptic rats showed decreased cortical thickness, and diffuse gliosis was observed with GFAP antibody. Neurofilament alterations were also detected in sections processed using SMI311 antiserum. In addition, a diffuse decrease of PV, GAD65, and GAT1 immunoreactivity was observed in the sensorimotor cortex. Altered expression of PV, GAD65, and GAT1 pointed out specific neocortical disturbances in GABAergic inhibition, which could play a crucial role in seizure generation and expression. Thus, the present findings indicate that damage of GABAergic interneurons could be strictly associated with neocortical hyperexcitability in temporal lobe epilepsy.
Using the epilepsy model obtained by systemic administration of pilocarpine in rats in the present study we investigated the changes caused by seizures on content and species of gangliosides and phospholipids, as well as on cholesterol concentration, glutathione reduced contents, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity and lipid peroxidation levels in rat hippocampus. Wistar rats received pilocarpine hydrochloride (400mg/kg, i.p., pilocarpine group), and other group received 0.9% saline (i.p., control group). Results showed that seizures significantly decreased the total content of lipids and glutathione reduced concentration in rat hippocampus. We also observed that seizures significantly reduced the absolute quantity of the major brain gangliosides (GM1, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b) and phospholipids (sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine). Our data also showed a decreased Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity and an increased TBARS levels in hippocampus of seized rats. If confirmed in human beings, these data could suggest that the alteration in lipid composition, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity, glutathione reduced content and TBARS levels caused by seizures might contribute to the neurophysiopathology of seizures observed in epileptic patients.
Sematilide, a close structural analog of N-acetylprocainamide, prolongs cardiac action potentials in vitro, whereas it does not depress maximum action potential upstroke slope, a "class III" action. This report outlines an evaluation of the clinical pharmacologic actions of sematilide in 14 patients with chronic high-frequency nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias. In all, 36 intravenous infusions (range 0.15 to 1.5 mg/kg over 15 minutes) were administered in a dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study design. Sematilide prolonged rate-corrected QT (QTc) in a dose- and concentration-related fashion, did not alter PR or QRS, and slowed heart rate at high concentrations (greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). The relations between dose and total area under the time-concentration curve, dose and peak plasma concentration, and peak plasma concentration and increase in QTc were linear (r = 0.66 to 0.92; p less than 0.001). QTc increases of approximately equal to 25% were seen at plasma concentrations of approximately equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml. The mean elimination half-life (+/- SD) was 3.6 +/- 0.8 hours, and most of a dose (77 +/- 13%) was recovered unchanged in the urine. Plasma concentrations greater than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml suppressed arrhythmias (5 patients) or aggravated them (3), including 1 patient who needed cardioversion for an episode of torsades de pointes (2.7 micrograms/ml). Thus, sematilide exerts class III actions in patients. Further studies to evaluate the role of this antiarrhythmic mode of action should be conducted at doses designed to limit QTc increases.
A 37 year old patient with chronic schizophrenia developed polydipsia and hyponatremia induced by several neuroleptics. We treated the patient successfully with molindone. The etiology of polydipsia with hyponatremia is discussed.
The protective efficacy of the antimuscarinic agent scopolamine was evaluated against soman (o-pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate [GD])-induced respiratory toxicity in guinea pigs. Anesthetized animals were exposed to GD (841 mg/m(3)) by microinstillation inhalation exposure and treated 30 seconds later with endotracheally aerosolized scopolamine (0.25 mg/kg) and allowed to recover for 24 hours. Treatment with scopolamine significantly increased survival and reduced clinical signs of toxicity and body weight loss in GD-exposed animals. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid showed normalization of GD-induced increased cell death, total cell count, and protein following scopolamine treatment. The BAL fluid acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase levels were also increased by scopolamine treatment. Respiratory dynamics parameters were normalized at 4 and 24 hours post-GD exposure in scopolamine-treated animals. Lung histology showed that scopolamine treatment reduced bronchial epithelial and subepithelial inflammation and multifocal alveolar septal edema. These results suggest that aerosolized scopolamine considerably protects against GD-induced respiratory toxicity.
The effects of salvinorin A (Salvia divinorum principal ingredient), a potent Œ∫-opioid natural hallucinogen, on learning and memory were investigated. Wistar rats were tested in the 8-arm radial maze, for object recognition and passive avoidance tasks for spatial, episodic, and aversive memory. Attention was assessed using a latent inhibition task. Salvinorin A (80-640 Œºg/kg subcutaneous [sc]) did not affect short-term memory, but it impaired spatial long-term memory. Episodic and aversive memories were impaired by salvinorin A (160-640 Œºg/kg). Memory impairment was blocked by the selective Œ∫-opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine ([nor-B]; 0.5-1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [ip]). Salvinorin A (160 Œºg/kg) disrupted latent inhibition, after LiCl treatment, such as reduced sucrose intake, suggesting an attention would result in an impairment of cognitive behavior. These findings demonstrate for the first time that salvinorin A has deleterious effects on learning and memory, through a Œ∫-opioid receptor mechanism.
