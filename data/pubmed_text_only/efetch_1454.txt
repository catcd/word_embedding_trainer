1. The main neurological disorders associated with chronic VSA are peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar disease, chronic encephalopathy and dementia. Apart from peripheral neuropathy, the clinical features are non-specific, evidence for solvent-related toxicity is in most cases circumstantial and there is no clear dose/response relationship. 2. Peripheral neuropathy is mainly associated with n-hexane and methyl n-butyl ketone. 3. Cerebellar disease is usually associated with toluene exposure; in the more severe cases there is often radiological evidence of irreversible cerebellar atrophy. 4. Chronic encephalopathy and dementia are the most serious consequence of solvent exposure, particularly to toluene in abusers and to mixed solvents in industrial workers. Postmortem studies in some abusers have shown generalized axonal degeneration, demyelination and brain atrophy. 5. Further studies on low level solvent exposure are needed as little is known about the neurological consequences of mild VSA, especially as regards individual susceptibility and possible interactions between solvents and other toxins such as ethanol.
Two cases of 5-fluorouracil-induced neurotoxicity from the University of North Carolina are presented. 5-Fluorouracil metabolism is briefly discussed with reference to possible mechanisms for the neurotoxicity. A possible role for thiamine supplementation in the prevention of this unusual complication is supported by our experience.
Reducing the mass of local anesthetic minimizes the effects of hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section and the incidence of maternal adverse events preserving fetal well-being, but it may result in insufficient anesthesia. Hypotension associated with greater masses of subarachnoid anesthesia can be controlled by prophylactic continuous infusion of phenylephrine. The effects of prophylactic continuous infusion of phenylephrine on pressure control on maternal and fetus results in cesarean sections with different doses of hyperbaric bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia.
A non-randomized prospective study of 60 gravidas at term scheduled for elective cesarean sections was undertaken. Patients were allocated into two groups depending on hyperbaric bupivacaine dose administered for spinal anesthesia, 12 or 8 mg, along with 5 μg of sufentanil and 100 μg of morphine. Patients were hydrated with 10 mL.kg(-1) of Ringer's lactate before the anesthesia. Shortly after, continuous infusion of 100 μg.min(-1) of phenylephrine was initiated to maintain blood pressure at baseline levels. The following parameters were evaluated: level of anesthetic blockade, consumption of vasopressors, incidence of maternal events, and conditions of the newborn.
Maternal data was similar in both groups regarding the level of anesthetic blockade, phenylephrine consumption along time, incidence of hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, pain, and tremors. Conceptual data showed similarities between both groups regarding blood gases and umbilical vein lactate levels. The pH of all newborns was > 7.2.
On maintaining the blood pressure with prophylactic continuous infusion of phenylephrine the incidence of maternal adverse events and conditions of birth do not differ whether spinal anesthesia is performed with 12 mg or 8 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine.
A study was made of the effects of gentamicin (40 mg/kg/day for 7 days) on the excretion of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium in the urine of rats. Volume of urine, protein excretion and the urinary activities of the enzymes alanine aminopeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase were also monitored. There were no significant changes in the excretion of sodium or potassium and the excretion of magnesium was too variable to permit a meaningful interpretation of changes in its excretion. Significant changes occurred in the excretion of calcium and protein and in the 24 hr urine osmolarity. The earliest of these changes, on day 4, was an increase in calcium excretion (P less than 0.01) which progressed until the drug was stopped and persisted throughout the 5 follow-up days. The increase in protein excretion was significant (P less than 0.01) by day 5 and the decrease in osmolarity (P less than 0.01) by day 6. These changes were preceded, on day 1, by a significant (P less than 0.001) rise in the activities in urine of all three enzymes. This early enzymuria suggests that considerable perturbation of cell integrity occurred before the increase in calcium excretion. Further studies are required to elucidate what role, if any, the loss of calcium plays in the genesis of tubular cell injury.
Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, was added to the treatment regimen of seven patients with biopsy proven inflammatory bowel disease. Six of the seven patients showed a marked clinical improvement in symptoms, especially pain and diarrhea after starting omeprazole. One of the six is using omeprazole as her sole medication for her colitis currently. Others have been able to decrease steroid doses. A possible mechanism of action relates the similar chemical structure of omeprazole to metronidazole which is efficacious in colitis.
Modulation of sex steroid pre-receptor in adipose tissue is important for the development of metabolic diseases, but its roles in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has not been fully characterized. Herein we compared the expression of key sex steroid converting enzymes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) between patients with PCOS and the matched controls. Most of the sex steroid converting enzymes were highly expressed in the SAT, except 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1). Compared with the controls, PCOS patients showed significantly higher levels of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase1-2 (3β-HSD1-2), aldo-keto reductase 1C 1-3 (AKR1C1-3) and leptin, but lower level of P450 aromatase and 5α-reductase 1. Interestingly, leptin was positively correlated to AKR1C2 expression and negatively to 5α-reductase1 as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). In summary, the expression of enzymes synthesizing testosterone and enzymes inactivating DHT and progesterone was higher in SAT of PCOS patients compared to controls. Correlation analysis indicated that increased leptin expression may be negatively related to local DHT level. These data suggested that sex steroid converting enzymes expression was different in SAT of PCOS patients that might contribute to abnormal testosterone and leptin level of PCOS patients.
Interferon alpha provides benefit in only a limited number of patients with chronic anti-HBe-positive hepatitis B. The aim of this study was to verify the long-term efficacy of lamivudine treatment of these patients and the incidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus mutants.
Fifteen consecutive patients with chronic anti-HBe-positive hepatitis B were treated with lamivudine 100 mg once daily for 52 weeks. Levels of alanine aminotransferase, HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, and IgM antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen were monitored during therapy and 12-month follow up. The polymerase gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and the region coding for YMDD amino acid motif was directly sequenced.
Only 2/15 patients (13%) had a sustained virological and biochemical response and improved histologically. Eleven out of 15 (74%) showed inhibition of viral replication and normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels during lamivudine treatment but relapsed 1-12 months after terminating therapy. In the two remaining patients (13%), HBV DNA initially became negative but reappeared in the serum after 24 weeks, and in both patients the emergence of YMDD mutants was demonstrated.
Our data confirm the antiviral efficacy of lamivudine in anti-HBe-positive patients, but response to a 1-year course was only transient as the majority of patients relapsed after therapy withdrawal. The lack of a sustained effect and the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutants suggest that therapy for chronic hepatitis B should be based on a combination of several therapeutic agents.
While the warfarin embryopathy is well defined, central nervous system abnormalities associated with gestational warfarin exposure require further definition. Based on the timing of warfarin exposure in humans, it has been proposed that second- and third-trimester exposure predisposes to CNS abnormalities while first-trimester exposure more typically is associated with the warfarin embryopathy. A case is presented of a liveborn male with Dandy Walker malformation, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and Peter anomaly of the right eye who was exposed to warfarin between the 8th and 12th weeks of gestation who had none of the stigmata of the warfarin embryopathy. His is the first known case of exposure confined to the first trimester, and the fifth case of Dandy Walker malformation among a total of 15 CNS cases associated with this drug. This case offers evidence that Dandy Walker malformation may represent a distinct complication of in utero first-trimester exposure, and consideration of these particular abnormalities with exposure limited to a period prior to the known appearance of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors suggests that warfarin has a direct teratogenic effect on central nervous system morphogenesis.
Despite its potential, use of trans-resveratrol as an anticancer drug is severely constrained because of its tendency to prolong gastric ulceration. We found that in addition to delaying ulcer healing, trans-resveratrol also aggravated acute gastric ulceration induced by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by reducing the synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E(2) via a specific inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 that also hampered angiogenesis. However, for the first time, we showed that the 3'-5'-hydroxylated congener [(E)-HST-1] of trans-resveratrol, synthesized in multigram scale, exerted potential chemotherapeutic property but was nonulcerogenic in nature, rather moderately accelerated healing of indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration. HST-1 did not suppress COX-1, COX-2 expression, and PGE(2) synthesis but reduced the level of inflammatory myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. The healing was augmented primarily through the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-dependent pathway. HST-1 treatment induced endothelial NOS (eNOS) expression and reduced inducible NOS (iNOS), resulting in increased eNOS/iNOS ratio. The selective iNOS inhibitor [L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl) lysine hydrochloride] and nonselective NOS inhibitor (N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) treatment revealed that eNOS could be the probable molecular switch to accelerate the indomethacin-induced ulcer healing in HST-1-treated mice. Furthermore, the anticancer effect of HST-1 on U937 and K562 leukemia cell lines was found to be significantly better than that of trans-resveratrol. Overall, these established HST-1 as a potentially better anticancer compound than trans-resveratrol, considering it is devoid of any ulcerogenic side effects. In conclusion, for the first time, we showed that a novel analog of trans-resveratrol, HST-1, was devoid of ulcerogenic adversative effects of trans-resveratrol but retained potentially better anticancer property.
Motor and state functioning of 20 infants born to methadone-maintained women and 25 born to controls was assessed at 1 day and 1 month of age using Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale with Kansas Supplements (NBAS-K). The infants were of mothers who were Black, of low SES, between the ages of 18 and 35 years, and who had good prenatal care. Motor behaviors were scored on NBAS-K items: General Tonus, Motor Maturity, and Tremulousness. State behaviors were scored on 2 items: Alertness and General Irritability. Guttman's Multidimensional Scalogram Analysis (MSA) of individual profiles revealed an orthogonal relationship between motor and state functioning, with motor functioning being a much clearer discriminator between methadone and non-methadone infants than state functioning. With age, both groups generally improved, but non-methadone infants maintained some of their advantage in motor functioning. Both groups showed a variety of behavior patterns during the neonatal period. The results suggest that methadone acts differentially on CNS functioning, with strong effects on neuro-motor functioning.
Both clinical and animal studies indicate that prenatal exposure to opiate produces effects that occur in two phases. An acute phase consists of a neonatal abstinence syndrome characterized by increased CNS arousal. The major behavior symptoms seen in both humans and animals include hyperactivity, disturbed sleep and increased lability of state. This early phase can be quite prolonged, lasting from 12 weeks hyperactivity, disturbed sleep and increased lability of state. This early phase can be quite prolonged, lasting from 12 weeks to six months in humans and 20-25 days in rats. Although confirming pharmacokinetic studies are needed, it is possible that these persistent symptoms result from the slow clearance of the drug from neonatal tissues. The second phase of the syndrome is less well-understood but the available clinical evidence suggests that exposure to heroin, particularly in a pattern of polydrug abuse, can result in impaired organizational and perceptual abilities, poor self-adjustment and in situations requiring motor inhibition, heightened activity. Studies of pre-school children exposed prenatally to methadone, show no effects on intellectual and cognitive functioning but do reveal heightened activity or energy level, impulsivity, and brief attention span and persistence. A finding of impaired motor inhibition while performing a task has been stressed by one worker as an area of particular vulnerability among these children. A strikingly similar effect, characterized as an impaired ability to modulate task-oriented motor activity, has been described for adult rats prenatally exposed to methadone.
The metabolic test with antipyrine was performed, the relationship between genotypes of GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms were studied, and cotinine level was measured in 116 men chronically exposed to mercury. The individuals were divided in 4 groups depending on the diagnosis of chronic mercury intoxication. The changes in the parameters of antipyrine test were studied in linked samples (N=62, 4 year interval); in patients with chronic mercury intoxication, the disease stage was taken into account. Inhibition of antipyrine metabolism, increased frequency of combination of GSTT1(0/0)/GSTM1(+) genotypes in patients with chronic mercury intoxication, and the specificity of cytochrome P450 inhibition with mercury suggest that disease progression is related to inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoforms in the brain that catalyze regulation of endogenous substrates.
Proteinuria is an important risk factor for cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy on proteinuria in normolipidemic patients with well-controlled hypertension have not been studied. A total of 63 normolipidemic (total cholesterol <240 mg/dL) and proteinuric (300 to 3000 mg/d) patients with well-controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg) were randomized to receive either placebo (n=32) or pravastatin (10 mg/d; n=31) after a 3-month placebo period. Pravastatin lowered proteinuria after 6 months by 54% (P<0.0001). Creatinine clearance was stable throughout the study in the 2 groups. Despite unchanged plasma endothelin-1 levels throughout the study, urinary excretion of the peptide was decreased and significantly correlated with improvement in urinary protein excretion in pravastatin-treated patients (r=0.64, P=0.001). The urinary excretion of retinol-binding protein decreased after pravastatin administration, probably reflecting an improvement in tubular function. In contrast, the urinary excretion of IgG did not change significantly throughout the study in either group. Multivariate analysis revealed that proteinuria was only significantly correlated with statin use (P<0.0001, R2= 0.66). Linear regression analysis in the statin-treated group did not show any correlation between changes in lipid profiles and proteinuria regression. Thus, in addition to their primary function of antilipidemia, the addition of pravastatin to treatment for well-controlled hypertension may have an additive effect on reducing proteinuria independent of hemodynamics and lipid-lowering effects, possibly through inhibiting renal endothelin-1 synthesis and improving tubular function.
1. The antihypertensive effect of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, trimepranol (10--14 mg/twice daily), chlorthalidone (50 mg every second day) and their combination was studied in eighteen patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In a controlled randomized cross-over study the drugs were given for 6 week periods. 2. A significant and equal decrease in blood pressure was achieved both with trimepranol and chlorthalidone, whereas their combination was significantly more effective. 3. Trimepranol significantly antagonized the chlorthalidone-induced hypokalemia. 4. The results favor the use of diuretic or diuretic-beta-adrenoceptor blocker combination over beta-adrenoceptor blocker monotherapy in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.
Motor functioning of 38 infants, 15 exposed in utero to methadone, was assessed on Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale with Kansas Supplements (NBAS-K) (Items: General Tonus, Motor Maturity, Activity, and Tremulousness) at 1 day, and at 4 months on Bayley Infant Behavior Record (IBR) (Items: Tension, Activity, Interest in Body Motion, Gross Coordination, and Fine Coordination). At 4 months, methadone infants generally showed a profile of poorer motor coordination, greater tenseness and interest in body motion, and higher activity level than did non-methadone infants. Guttman's Multidimensional Scalogram Analysis (MSA) of the 5 IBR motor-item profiles showed that a line can be drawn that almost perfectly discriminates the methadone and non-methadone infants by their joint performance on these 5 variables. A scatterplot of each infant's sum scores of the Brazelton versus IBR motor items revealed a significant correlation between 1-day and 4-month motor functioning. Methadone infants showed poorer motor functioning at both ages. This analysis of behavioral continuity again revealed an almost perfect discrimination between the two groups.
The influence of sevoflurane on lidocaine-induced convulsions was studied in cats. The convulsive threshold (mean +/- SD) was 41.4 +/- 6.5 mg. l(-1) with lidocaine infusion (6 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)), increasing significantly to 66.6 +/- 10.9 mg. l(-1) when the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was 0.8%. However, the threshold (61.6 +/- 8.7 mg. l(-1)) during 1.6% sevoflurane was not significant from that during 0.8% sevoflurane, indicating a celling effect. There was no significant difference in the convulsive threshold between sevoflurane and enflurane. The rise in blood pressure became less marked when higher concentrations of sevoflurane or enflurane were administered and the blood pressure at convulsions decreased significantly in 1.6% sevoflurane, and in 0.8% and 1.6% enflurane. However, there was no significant difference in the lidocaine concentrations measured when the systolic blood pressure became 70 mmHg. Apamin, a selective blocker of calcium-dependent potassium channels, was administered intracerebroventricularly in rats anesthetized with 0.8% sevoflurane to investigate the mechanism of the anticonvulsive effects. Apamin (10 ng) had a tendency to decrease the convulsive threshold (21.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.9 +/- 2.5 mg. l(-1)) but this was not statistically significant. It is suggested that sevoflurane reduces the convulsive effect of lidocaine toxicity but carries some risk due to circulatory depression.
A case is reported of a 68-year-old woman admitted to the intensive care unit with an adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to accidental poisoning with anhydrous phthalic acid. She was given prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (Fraxiparine). During the period of intensive care (mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure), the patient experienced a stroke from which she recovered only partially. During pleurectomy for persistent pneumothorax, a lung biopsy was carried out. It confirmed the diagnosis of ARDS and recognized multiple pulmonary arterial thrombi. Because of these two thrombotic phenomena, a coagulation defect was searched for. Platelet aggregation tests were all positive with heparin and two low molecular weight fractions. The patient recovered remarkably once she was no longer given Fraxiparine, being extubated nine days afterwards. Six months after discharge, the patient's platelets still aggregated with heparin. The possible mechanism was a heparin-platelet-endothelium complex. It is noteworthy that, in this case, no thrombocytopaenia was found. It may have been countered by thrombocytosis, induced by cellular factors released during ARDS.
Thalidomide is increasingly being used due to its effectiveness in the treatment of a variety of dermatologic conditions refractory to other treatments. Although thalidomide's side effects have been well-documented in the literature since its entry in the 1950s, some of the risks associated with its use are still being discovered. Recently, increased incidence of venous thrombosis following thalidomide use has been reported in the treatment of diseases with disease-related thrombotic risks, such as malignancy and lupus with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, as well as concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and/or systemic corticosteroids. We report a case of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolus (PE) following thalidomide use in a patient with leprosy (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL) who was concurrently treated with prednisone, as well as a review of relevant literature. Our findings substantiate an increase in risk for thrombosis following thalidomide use in the dermatology and non-cancer clinical setting.
Migrainelike headache is a sequela of cocaine use. This finding expands the range of neurological complications of cocaine use and is consistent with the potential role of serotonin in the development of migraine. In these subjects, the desire to avoid the cocaine-induced headache eventually became part of the resolve to quit use.
1. We compared the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist valsartan in cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced hypertension and nephrotoxicity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. SHR (8 - 9 weeks old) on high-sodium diet were given CsA (5 mg kg(-1)d (-1) s.c. ) for 6 weeks. The rats were treated concomitantly either with enalapril (30 mg kg(-1)d (-1) p.o.) or valsartan (3 or 30 mg kg(-1) d (-1) p.o.). To evaluate the role of bradykinin in the action of enalapril, some rats received a bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist icatibant (HOE 140, 500 microg kg(-1) d (-1) s.c.) during the last 2 weeks of enalapril treatment. 3. Blood pressure was recorded every second week by tail cuff method. Renal function was measured by serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and urinary excretion of proteins at the end of the experiment. The activity of the renal kallikrein-kinin system was estimated by urinary kallikrein excretion. 4. CsA caused hypertension, impaired renal function and induced morphological nephrotoxicity with glomerular damage and interstitial fibrosis. Enalapril and the lower dose of valsartan attenuated the CsA-induced hypertension to the same extent, while the higher dose of valsartan totally abolished it. Icatibant did not reduce the antihypertensive effect of enalapril. Urinary kallikrein excretion was similar in all groups. 5. Enalapril and valsartan equally prevented the CsA-induced deterioration of kidney function and morphology. 6. The renin-angiotensin but not the kallikrein-kinin system plays a crucial role in CsA-toxicity during high intake of sodium in SHR.
Abecarnil (isopropyl-6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) is a metabolically stable anxiolytic and anticonvulsant beta-carboline derivative with few sedative and muscle relaxant effects in rodents. Abecamil binds with high affinity to benzodiazepine receptors. Because long-term treatment with benzodiazepines leads to development of dependence, we evaluated in mice whether abecarnil also possesses a potential for producing dependence, using electroencephalographic and electromyographic monitoring, and behavioral assessment of anxiety to detect withdrawal responses after chronic treatment. Diazepam was used as a reference. Mice withdrawn from chronic treatment with diazepam (15 mg/kg/day for 12 days) showed a time-related evolution of anxiety, muscle rigidity and seizures between days 4 and 21 after discontinuation of the treatment. A period between withdrawal days 1 and 3 was symptom free. Mice withdrawn from chronic administration of abecarnil (6 mg/kg/day for 12 days) showed no anxiety and no changes in seizure susceptibility and muscle tone. The doses of diazepam and abecarnil used for chronic treatment were equivalent in terms of kinetics and binding to benzodiazepine receptors. These data indicate that long-term treatment with abecarnil does not induce benzodiazepine-like dependence in mice. Thus, it may be predicted that chronic treatment with abecarnil in humans may offer an important alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety.
Airway irritation is a major drawback of desflurane anesthesia. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of intravenous fentanyl given before thiopental induction on airway irritation caused by a stepwise increase in desflurane in children.
Eighty children (2-8 years) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind study. Forty received saline and 40 received 2 microg/kg of fentanyl intravenously; this was followed by thiopental sodium 5 mg/kg in both groups. Patients were assistant-ventilated with desflurane 1%, which was then increased by 1% every six breaths up to 10%. During this period, cough, secretion, excitation and apnea were graded and the desflurane concentration at which airway irritation symptoms first occurred was recorded. The results were analyzed using Pearson's chi-squared test.
The incidence of typical airway irritation events was lower with fentanyl than with saline (cough, 2.5% vs. 42.5%; secretion, 27.5% vs. 82.5%; excitation, 10% vs. 82.5%; apnea, 20% vs. 65%; P < 0.05). The mean expired desflurane concentration at which the first airway irritation symptom occurred was greater with fentanyl than with saline (7.3% vs. 5.5%, P < 0.05).
Intravenous fentanyl in children reduces airway complications caused by desflurane.
An increased and prolonged duration of pain relief after morphine administration has been found in elderly patients. Whether this is due to alterations in pharmacokinetics, receptor binding profile or other factors remains unsolved. The aims were to elucidate the pharmacokinetics after intravenous administration of morphine and oxycodone in elderly patients older than 70 years.
A randomized non-blinded study with 16 patients aged older than 70 years scheduled for elective hip replacement receiving morphine or oxycodone 0.05 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 15 minutes.
A 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model best described the disposition of morphine and oxycodone. The estimated elimination half-lives for morphine and oxycodone were (mean +/- SD) 2.7 +/- 3.6 (range 0.8-11.6) and 3.1 +/- 1.3 (range 1.1-4.8) hr, respectively. Volume of distribution at steady state was estimated to be 243 +/- 256 and 277 +/- 187 L, and clearance to be 1748 +/- 623 and 1206 +/- 546 ml/min for morphine and oxycodone, respectively.
The increased and prolonged duration of pain relief after morphine administration seen in some elderly patients cannot, based on these findings, be ascribed to changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters between elderly and younger patients. Similar for oxycodone, no changes in the pharmacokinetic could be found when comparing the parameters found in elderly patients with those from younger healthy volunteers. A great variability within the individual pharmacokinetic parameters was seen for both drugs. Therefore, we recommend that treatment with morphine and oxycodone in elderly patients is initiated very conservatively and is titrated slowly to effect.
Cholinergic neurons play a major role in memory and attention. The dysfunction and death of these neurons, especially in the hippocampus, are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, studying the cholinergic properties and cell survival may help in treating this disease. We investigated the possible effects of [6]-shogaol on cholinergic signaling in HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells. HT22 cells express essential cholinergic markers, including choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and choline transporter (ChTp). HT22 cells treated with H(2)O(2) for 3h showed an increase in ROS production (35%). These features were partly recovered by [6]-shogaol. Treating H(2)O(2)-treated HT22 cells with [6]-shogaol markedly increased the expression of ChAT and ChTp, an effect similar to that of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, K-252a, an inhibitor of the BDNF receptor Trk B, attenuated the effects of both [6]-shogaol and BDNF. These data suggest that [6]-shogaol protects neurons by increasing ChAT and ChTp expression through a BDNF increase and thus may be useful for treating neurodegenerative diseases.
Case report of a hepatic adenoma which most probably developed under oral anticonceptives. The tumor of 1.2kg was resected atypically with the help of a Sharplan-CO2 Laserbeam, resulting in minimal blood loss. The pros and contras of the surgical laser are being discussed.
