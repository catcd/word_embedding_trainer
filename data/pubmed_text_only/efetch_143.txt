We investigated the in vitro effect of the water-soluble, highly stable thalidomide analogue CC-3052 on HIV-1 expression and TNF-alpha production in latently infected promonocytic U1 cells, acutely infected T cells and monocyte-derived human macrophages (MDM), and in mitogen-stimulated ex vivo cultures from patients with primary acute HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 expression was assessed by Northern blot analysis of RNAs, and ELISA for p24 antigen release and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. TNF-alpha expression was evaluated by RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-ELISA for mRNA and ELISA for protein secretion. We demonstrated that CC-3052 is able to inhibit HIV-1 expression, as evaluated by mRNA, p24 release and RT activity, in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)- and cytokine-stimulated U1 cells. Furthermore, CC-3052 inhibited HIV-1 expression, as evaluated by p24 and RT activity, in acutely infected MDM and T cells. As far as TNF-alpha is concerned, CC-3052 significantly reduced TNF-alpha mRNA and protein secretion in PMA-stimulated U937 and U1 cells, and in PMA-stimulated uninfected and acutely infected MDM. Consistently, the addition of CC-3052 reduced TNF-alpha production in phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated whole blood cultures from patients during the primary acute phase of HIV-1 infection. Since TNF-alpha is among the most potent enhancers of HIV-1 expression, the effect of CC-3052 on TNF-alpha may account for its inhibitory activity on HIV-1 expression. Given the well documented immunopathological role of TNF-alpha and its correlation with viral load, advanced disease and poor prognosis, CC-3052 could be an interesting drug for the design of therapeutic strategies in association with anti-retroviral agents.
To investigate synergistic effect of bromocriptine (BCT) combining tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on reversing multidrug resistance in a nude mouse model of liver neoplasm.
Human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG(2) (HepG(2) group), drug resistant hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG(2)/adriamycin (HepG(2)/ADM group) and hepatocarcinoma cell line transfected with TNF-alpha gene HepG(2)/ADM/TNF (TNF group and BCT group) were injected into the liver of nude mice via orthotopic implantation to establish multidrug resistance model of liver neoplasm in vivo. All the mice were injected with 5-fluouracil + adriamycin + mitomycin in abdominal cavity for 7 d. The mice in BCT group was simultaneously given bromocriptine through gastric canal. Size and weight of the tumor were measured. Furthermore tumor histological character and growth of the nude mice was observed and its chemosensitivity was tested. MDR associated genes and proteins (MRP, LRP) of implanted tumors were detected by immunohistochemical staining and reverse transcriptive polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and apoptosis rate of hepatocarcinoma cells was detected by TUNEL assay.
The nude mouse model of each cell line was all inoculated successfully. The tumor growth rate and weight were significantly different among groups (P < 0.05). After chemotherapy tumor growth inhibition rate was higher in BCT group (67%) compared to ADM and TNF groups (P < 0.01), and similar to HepG(2) group (54%). MDR1 and LRP mRNA could be detected in all groups, but TNF-alpha was detected only in TNF-alpha and BCT groups. Furthermore, MDR1 and LRP protein expression of tumors in TNF-alpha and BCT groups was low similar to HepG(2) group. The apoptosis rate of hepatocarcinoma cells was much higher in BCT group than in other groups (P < 0.05) with TUNEL assay.
TNF-alpha gene can down-regulate the MDR associated genes and proteins expression for example MDR1, LRP, and lower its tumorgenesis. Moreover, bromocriptine can enhance the susceptibility of HepG(2)/ADM cells to cytotoxic drugs.
The venous complications associated with the administration of two preparations of diazepam, an aqueous (Valium) or a lipid (Diazemuls) preparation were investigated in 100 patients before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a double-blind randomized study. No differences in pain during injection or subsequent thrombophlebitis were found when a large vein was used for the injections. In a retrospective study of 78 patients who had received either preparation in a vein on the dorsum of the hand, the frequency of thrombophlebitis was significantly less with the lipid preparation. Both preparations provided effective sedation for endoscopy.
Abuse of ergotamine can release a generalised brain edema and brain infarctions. This can be visualized by CT, MR and angiography. The reason, however, can only be found in the patients history.
The frequency of muscle pain was studied in two groups of patients. One group consisted of 106 women undergoing Caesarean section; the other comprised 20 pre-menopausal women undergoing hysterectomy. Both groups received a single bolus injection of suxamethonium 100 mg to facilitate tracheal intubation. There was a statistically significant decrease in the frequency of muscle pain in the pregnant group (7.5%) compared with the non-pregnant group (30%).
Multiple blood pressure readings were obtained with time in 12 infants with documented in utero exposure to cocaine. Approximately half had hypertension or high-normal blood pressure with no evidence of renal, cardiovascular, or endocrinologic abnormalities.
It has been shown that multiple exposures of gravid rats to cocaine during late gestation result in significant incidences of severe malformations. Hind limb reduction defects were frequent findings in this study. Other studies have shown that comparable abnormalities can be induced in experimental animals by various procedures including vascular clamping, direct fetal exposure to epinephrine, uterine handling following laparotomy, as well as by exposure to hyperbaric oxygen. This paper reviews these and other studies, and presents a novel mechanistic hypothesis that explains their common findings. It is proposed that in each instance, conceptual hypoxia results from hypoperfusion caused by transient vasoconstriction. Following the resumption of normal perfusion, reactive oxygen species are generated by the ischemia/reperfusion mechanisms thought to underlie many pathobiologic lesions. It is proposed that the conceptus is particularly vulnerable to the toxicity of oxygen radicals because of its low antioxidant activities and the highly reduced state of its undifferentiated cells. Sensitivity to cocaine and uterine handling appears to be enhanced during late gestation and it is hypothesized that this results from changes in oxygenation and iron content that increase both the substrate and catalyst for generation of reactive oxygen species.
Pentamidine isethionate has been associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. This article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to date. Pentamidine-induced torsade de pointes may be related to serum magnesium levels and hypomagnesemia may synergistically induce torsade. Torsade de pointes occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with pentamidine. In these patients, no other acute side effects of pentamidine were observed. Torsade de pointes can be treated when recognized early, possibly without discontinuation of pentamidine. When QTc interval prolongation is observed, early magnesium supplementation is advocated.
Using the Affymetrix 500K Mapping array and publicly available genotypes, we identified 18 SNPs whose allele frequency differed significantly(P < 1 x 10(-5)) between pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases (n = 317) and non-ALL controls (n = 17,958). Two SNPs in ARID5B not only differed between ALL and non-ALL groups (rs10821936, P = 1.4 x 10(-15), odds ratio (OR) = 1.91; rs10994982, P = 5.7 x 10(-9), OR = 1.62) but also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from other subtypes (rs10821936, P = 1.62 x 10(-5), OR = 2.17; rs10994982, P = 0.003, OR 1.72). These ARID5B SNPs also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from other subtypes in an independent validation cohort (n = 124 children with ALL; P = 0.003 and P = 0.0008, OR 2.45 and 2.86, respectively) and were associated with methotrexate accumulation and gene expression pattern in leukemic lymphoblasts. We conclude that germline variants affect susceptibility to, and characteristics of, specific ALL subtypes.
Chronic cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin occurs at least one year after the chemotherapy is finished. As such, it is a serious late complication in patients with malignant lymphomas. The aim of the study was to identify the incidence of late clinical and subclinical doxorubicin cardiotoxicity and cardiopulmonary performance of patients being in remission for five and more years from the initial therapy.
We worked with 96 patients (47 men and 49 women) aged 43 +/- 15 (median 41, 23-79) years. Average period of monitoring was 6.2 +/- 1.5 (median 6.5-10) years. On the basis of therapy protocol, the patients were administered a maximum doxorubicin cumulative dose (CD DOX) of 377 +/- 147 (median 300, 50-880) mg/m2. Additional treatment after initial conventional therapy was performed in 32 patients (33%) due to high risk, progression or relapse of tumour. EXAMINATION METHODS: Patients were examined by resting echocardiography before and after initial therapy, and during follow-up examination after 5 years. Also, dynamic stress echocardiography and spiroergometry were performed during follow-up examination. Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease below 50 %, progressive decrease of LVEF > 10 % as compared with initial value, and decreased peak oxygen intake pVO2 < 20 ml/kg/min were considered as pathological. We also evaluated systolic function and index of myocardial performance (Tei-index).
Clinical cardiotoxicity was observed in 4 % of patients, subclinical in 31% of patients. Diastolic dysfunction was found in 38 % of patients; pathological values of Tei-index were noted in 31% of patients. Value of stress increment of LVEF was 13 +/- 4 % (median 12; 5-25). Decreased pVO2 was observed in 15 % of patients. Cardiovascular disease and age > 60 years represent a higher risk of left ventricular dysfunction. Additional treatment after initial therapy represents a higher risk only if diastolic dysfunction is found (OR = 2.37, p < 0.05). Multi-dimensional regression analysis proved the relationship between pathological EF, CD DOX > or = 300 mg/m2, age > 60 years and cardiovascular disease (for CD DOX p < 0.05; age p < 0.01; concomitant cardiovascular disease p < 0.01, with r = 0.57 and p < 0.02 values for the overall model).
The above-mentioned findings should positively influence the approach of oncologists and haematologists to long-term cardiological monitoring (at least with the help of resting echocardiography) in adult patients treated with antracyclines during initial chemotherapy.
The direct effect of the local anesthetic lidocaine was studied using the hippocampal slice preparation in order to assess the involvement of this structure in lidocaine-induced seizure activity. Changes in the evoked field potential amplitude and latency were used to measure the effect of the drug. A dose-dependent depression of the evoked field potentials was observed at lidocaine concentration of 10(-4)M and greater. No synchronized population bursting (seizures) was observed at any of the concentrations tested (10(-6)M to 10(-3)M). However, the hippocampal slice preparation is capable of producing seizure activity, as was demonstrated following application of penicillin G. The results suggest that the hippocampus is not the site of lidocaine-induced seizure activity.
To evaluate pulmonary responses to intratracheal administration of surfactant with and without dexamethasone in rats with paraquat-induced lung injury.
Prospective, randomized, controlled study.
University research facility.
Adult male Sprague Dawley rats.
Rats were anesthetized and underwent a tracheostomy and arterial catheter insertion 3 days after intraperitoneal injection of paraquat (35 mg/kg). The rats were ventilated for 90 mins after sequential designation as controls or as recipients of intratracheal surfactant alone (50 or 100 mg/kg) or surfactant (50 or 100 mg/kg) plus dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg).
Arterial blood gases were determined at 15, 30, 60, and 90 mins. After 90 mins of ventilation, a static pressure-volume curve was performed, and inflammatory cells, total protein content, and cytokines were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Postmortem histology was then examined. Treatment with 50 mg/kg dexamethasone/Survanta and 100 mg/kg Survanta with and without dexamethasone significantly increased oxygenation shortly after instillation when compared with the control group, with the response maintained throughout the study period. Static pressure-volume curves showed that the group receiving 100 mg/kg dexamethasone/Survanta had significantly higher lung volumes than the control group. Total cell, neutrophil, and macrophage counts were decreased significantly in the animals treated with 100 mg/kg dexamethasone/Survanta compared with untreated control rats. Total protein recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the animals treated with 100 mg/kg Survanta with and without dexamethasone was decreased significantly compared with control animals. The histologic appearance of the lungs was markedly better in the groups treated with surfactant with or without dexamethasone.
Results suggest that the combined administration of high doses of intratracheal surfactant and dexamethasone improves gas exchange, ameliorates lung inflammation, and alleviates lung damage after paraquat-induced lung injury. Surfactant alone and lower doses of surfactant plus dexamethasone had a lesser effect on these measures.
In this study, we evaluated the effects of α-mangostin on cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 ERα-positive human breast cancer cells. Our results showed that α-mangostin inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation whereas ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells were less sensitive to the agent. Additionally, α-mangostin effectively induced apoptosis as evidenced by the appearance of apoptotic nuclei observed with Hoechst 33258 staining and evaluation of sub-G1 DNA contents by flow cytometry. α-Mangostin also activated caspases-8, -9, and -7; increased the protein levels of Bax, p53, and cytosolic cytochrome c; and induced PARP cleavage while reducing Bid and Bcl-2 protein expression. In addition, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was transported from mitochondria to the cytosol after α-mangostin treatment. α-mangostin also induced apoptosis in 17-β-estradiol (E2)-stimulated MCF-7 cells in parallel with the non-stimulated cells. Moreover, treatment with 10μM α-mangostin for 48h specifically decreased the expression of ERα and pS2, an estrogen-responsive gene, in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of ERα expression in MCF-7 cells with siRNA attenuated α-mangostin-induced cell growth inhibition and caspase-7 activation. These results suggest that ERα is required for α-mangostin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Therefore, α-mangostin may be used to prevent and treat of ER-positive breast cancer.
Although chronic amiodarone has been proven to be effective to suppress ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), how we predict the recurrence of VT/VF after chronic amiodarone remains unknown. This study evaluated the predictive value of the QT interval, spatial, and transmural dispersions of repolarization (SDR and TDR) for further arrhythmic events after chronic amiodarone. Eighty-seven leads body surface ECGs were recorded before (pre) and one month after (post) chronic oral amiodarone in 50 patients with sustained monomorphic VT associated with organic heart disease. The Q-Tend (QTe), the Q-Tpeak (QTp), and the interval between Tpeak and Tend (Tp-e) as an index of TDR were measured automatically from 87-lead ECG, corrected Bazett's method (QTce, QTcp, Tcp-e), and averaged among all 87 leads. As an index of SDR, the maximum (max) minus minimum (min) QTce (max-min QTce) and standard deviation of QTce (SD-QTce) was obtained among 87 leads. All patients were prospectively followed (15 +/- 10 months) after starting amiodarone, and 20 patients had arrhythmic events. The univariate analysis revealed that post max QTce, post SD-QTce, post max-min QTce, and post mean Tcp-e from 87-lead but not from 12-lead ECG were the significant predictors for further arrhythmic events. ROC analysis indicated the post max-min QTce > or = 106 ms as the best predictor of events (hazard ratio = 10.4, 95%, CI 2.7 to 40.5, P = 0.0008). Excessive QT prolongation associated with increased spatial and transmural dispersions of repolarization predict the recurrence of VT/VF after amiodarone treatment.
Altered function of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain has recently been associated with an idiopathic form of partial epilepsy, suggesting that functional alterations of these receptors can be involved in the processes leading to epileptic seizures. Thus, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may form a novel target for antiepileptic drug development. In the present study, various nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, including novel amino-alkyl-cyclohexane derivatives, were evaluated in two animal models, namely the maximal electroshock seizure test in mice and amygdala-kindling in rats. For comparison with these standard models of generalized and partial seizures, the effects against nicotine-induced seizures were examined. Because some of the agents tested showed an overlap between channel blocking at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and NMDA receptors, the potency at these receptors was assessed by using patch clamp in a hippocampal cell preparation. Preferential nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists were potent anticonvulsants in the maximal electroshock seizure test and against nicotine-induced seizures. The anticonvulsant potency in the maximal electroshock seizure test was decreased by administration of a subconvulsant dose of nicotine. Such a potency shift was also seen with selective NMDA receptor antagonists, which were also efficacious anticonvulsants against both maximal electroshock seizures and nicotine-induced seizures. Experiments with agents combining nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and NMDA receptor antagonistic effects suggested that both mechanisms contributed to the anticonvulsant effect of the respective agents in the maximal electroshock seizure test. This was not found in kindled rats, in which nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists exerted less robust effects. In conclusion, it may be suggested that nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism might be a valuable therapeutic approach to treat generalized epileptic seizures but rather not complex partial seizures.
To perform a systematic literature review of the long-term safety of methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
A search was performed in Medline, Cochrane and EMBASE. Adults with RA who had received MTX monotherapy for more than 2 years were studied.
88 published studies were included. Over 12 years of treatment, the termination rate of MTX due to toxicity was less than for sulfasalazine, gold, d-penicillamine and higher than for hydroxychloroquine (level of evidence 2a-2b). Long-term use of MTX does not appear to be a risk factor for serious infections, including herpes zoster (2b-4), and could provide a survival benefit by reducing cardiovascular mortality (2b). The prevalence of raised liver enzymes (more than twice the upper limit of normal) is close to 13% of patients; 3.7% of patients stopped MTX permanently owing to liver toxicity (2b). Data on the risk for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis are conflicting: a meta-analysis showed an incidence of fibrosis of 2.7% after 4 years of MTX (2a). However, two other studies on sequential liver biopsies did not show evidence for developing severe damage (2b). Insufficient data are available to fully assess the risk of lymphoma and malignancies, although there is no strong evidence of increased risk (2b-4).
This systematic literature search on MTX monotherapy with relatively low-dose use during at least 2 years shows favourable long-term safety.
After blocking aldehyde dehydrogenase activity with disulfiram in rats, a single injection of ethanol or a single day of inhaling ethanol vapor resulted in neuronal degeneration in the cerebral cortex and elsewhere that was detected by a specific silver stain and by electron microscopy. Treatment of rats with alcohol alone and with disulfiram alone did not cause neuronal degeneration. The minimum blood alcohol levels and disulfiram doses administered to the rats which caused neural degeneration are not distant from those values described in a clinical case of abuse of disulfiram.
Acrolein is the metabolite of cyclophosphamide (CP) believed to be involved in the bladder toxicity associated with this anticancer drug. The mechanism by which this extremely reactive intermediate is delivered to the bladder is not known. Glutathione (GSH) readily conjugates with acrolein, and the acrolein mercapturate S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-N-acetylcysteine (3-hydroxy-PrMCA) has been found in the urine of animals and man given CP. The objectives of this study were to prepare and characterize synthetic standards of the GSH acrolein adduct (3-oxopropyl)glutathione (3-oxoPrGSH), the acrolein mercapturates S-(3-oxopropyl)-N-acetylcysteine (3-oxoPrMCA) and 3-hydroxyPrMCA, and the S-oxidation product of 3-oxoPrMCA (3-oxoPrMCA S-oxide). In addition, the release of acrolein from, and the bladder toxicity of, these conjugates was determined. 3-OxoPrGSH and 3-oxoPrMCA were prepared with a 99% yield by condensing acrolein with GSH and N-acetylcysteine, respectively. 3-HydroxyPrMCA was prepared with a 63% yield by refluxing 3-chloropropanol and N-acetylcysteine in a basic medium. Oxidation of 3-oxoPrMCA with H2O2 was used to prepare 3-oxoPrMCA S-oxide. By decreasing the reaction time to 1 h, and adjusting the ratio of 3-oxoPrMCA to H2O2, the yield of 3-oxoPrMCA S-oxide was increased to 96%. The anhydrous aldehyde, 3-oxoPrMCA, afforded characteristic aldehydic proton resonances (1H NMR) in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide. New resonances were observed in deuterated water, indicating a 75% hydration of the aldehyde to the corresponding geminal diol. This phenomenon was enhanced with 3-oxoPrMCA S-oxide where approximately 100% hydration of the aldehyde to the corresponding geminal diol was observed. When incubated at 25 degrees C in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 M KCl, pH 8.0, 3-oxoPrMCA released approximately 6% and 3-oxoPrMCA S-oxide released approximately 16-18% of the theoretical maximum yield of acrolein after 30 min, as indicated by an increase in absorbance at 210 nm and confirmed by trapping this aldehyde as a semicarbazone. There was less than a 2% yield of acrolein from 3-hydroxyPrMCA or 3-oxoPrGSH under similar conditions. At pH 7.4 the release of acrolein from 3-oxoPrMCA and 3-oxoPrMCA S-oxide was decreased by 50%. An assay where aldehydes are reacted with m-aminophenol in acid media produced fluorescence consistent with 72%, 46%, 23%, and 1% yields of acrolein from 3-oxoPrMCA S-oxide, 3-oxoPrMCA, 3-oxoPrGSH, and 3-hydroxyPrMCA, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
The present study was performed to gain more information on the nature of the opioid peptide(s) involved in the mechanism of action of alpha-methyldopa. Conscious, normotensive Wistar rats were used and all treatments were given intracisternally. For blood pressure and heart rate, pretreatment with a midportion beta-endorphin antiserum resulted in a parallel shift to the right of the dose-response curve for alpha-methyldopa. In addition, when rats were pretreated with various dilutions of this antiserum and treated with a constant dose of alpha-methyldopa, the antiserum dose-dependently inhibited alpha-methyldopa-induced hypotension and bradycardia. Using antisera specifically recognizing the C-terminus of beta-, gamma- and alpha-endorphin, respectively, revealed that only the beta-endorphin antiserum inhibited the decrease in blood pressure seen after administration of alpha-methyldopa. An antiserum against [Met5]enkephalin did not influence the cardiovascular responses following alpha-methyldopa. On the other hand, a dynorphin(1-13) antiserum also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the hypotension induced by alpha-methyldopa. When administered 3 h after the injection of alpha-methyldopa, the beta-endorphin and dynorphin(1-13) antisera failed to reverse the hypotension induced by alpha-methyldopa. The results favor a role for beta-endorphin(1-31) and dynorphin(1-13) in the hypotension centrally mediated by alpha-methyldopa.
The inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) via phosphorylation by Akt or protein kinase C (PKC), or the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades can play a pivotal role in left ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction. Our previous data showed that MAPK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathways could be modulated by poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibition raising the possibility that cardiac hypertrophic signaling responses may be favorably influenced by PARP inhibitors. A novel PARP inhibitor (L-2286) was tested in a rat model of chronic heart failure following isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction. Subsequently, cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial collagen deposition were assessed; additionally, mitochondrial enzyme activity and the phosphorylation state of GSK-3beta, Akt, PKC and MAPK cascades were monitored. PARP inhibitor (L-2286) treatment significantly reduced the progression of postinfarction heart failure attenuating cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, and preserving the integrity of respiratory complexes. More importantly, L-2286 repressed the hypertrophy-associated increased phosphorylation of panPKC, PKC alpha/betaII, PKC delta and PKC epsilon, which could be responsible for the activation of the antihypertrophic GSK-3beta. This work provides the first evidence that PARP inhibition beneficially modulates the PKC/GSK-3beta intracellular signaling pathway in a rat model of chronic heart failure identifying a novel drug target to treat heart failure.
A 44-year-old maniacodepressive woman developed acute encephalopathy due to the association of lithium carbonate and haloperidol. She was treated with lithium salts for many years and the serum level of lithium was within the therapeutic range. The encephalopathy was worsened by hyperthermia, dehydration, and reintroduction of haloperidol, 5 days after the first discontinuation of the neuroleptic. The clinical features were characterized by a persistent cerebellar syndrome, more than one year after the interruption of these medications.
A 30 year old women, beginning her 19th day postpartum, was admitted for lowering of alertness. The day before she complained of cephalalagia. Neurologic examination showed pyramidal tract signs on the right part of the body, a bilateral Babinski sign, and central oculomotor palsy. She started a treatment by nasal pulverization of phenylephrine, a sympathomimetic vasoconstrictor, one week before, and took bromocriptine (5 mg per day) from childbirth to second week postpartum. CT scan was normal. Lumbar puncture showed a high level of proteins, from transsudative origin. Cerebral angiography showed a beading aspect of arterial branches, especially in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Two days after drug withdrawal, the patient recovered. This angiographic pattern has already been described in cases of cerebral angiopathy due to sympathomimetic drug abuse, and in cases of postpartum cerebral angiopathy. The chronology, in our case, makes the responsibility of the phenylephrine very likely. Nonetheless, ergot derivatives (i.e. ergonovine, bromocriptine) have also been accused of giving cerebral postpartum angiopathy. In our case, we think that bromocriptine may have triggered the cerebral angiopathy due to phenylephrine.
Carcinogenesis is often linked to aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling, in many cases caused by activating CTNNB1 mutations (encoding β-catenin). Recently, β-catenin was established as a decisive regulator of hepatic glutamine synthetase (GS) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) expression in mouse hepatocarcinogenesis. This study was aimed to analyse the connection of β-catenin signalling and GS/CYP expression in human paediatric tumours. Samples from 23 paediatric tumours were analysed for activating mutations in CTNNB1. Protein expression of the model β-catenin target GS and of various CYP isoforms was analysed and correlated with CTNNB1 mutational status and histological findings. Activating CTNNB1 mutations were frequent in hepatoblastoma (80%) and nephroblastoma (31%). In CTNNB1-mutated hepatoblastoma, expression of GS was only detected in tumour areas with epithelial, not with mesenchymal differentiation. Particularly high expression of glutamine synthetase was found in hepatoblastoma cells directly neighbouring a mesenchymal-type tumour area or stroma cells, associated with above-average cell proliferation. GS expression was not observed in CTNNB1-mutated nephroblastoma. Hepatoblastoma with activated β-catenin expressed different CYPs relevant for the metabolism of cytostatic drugs, but with high interindividual variance and heterogeneity within a single tumour. GS and different CYPs are co-expressed in hepatoblastoma with activated β-catenin. Moreover, other factors like histological subtype of tumour cells and cell-cell-interactions at the borders between different areas of the tumours affect expression of these β-catenin target genes. Analysis of CYP expression in resected tumour tissue might be useful for the selection of appropriate cytostatics for post-operative chemotherapy.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although common, the etiology of PD remains poorly understood. Genetic studies infer that the disease results from a complex interaction between genetics and environment and there is growing evidence that PD may represent a constellation of diseases with overlapping yet distinct underlying mechanisms. Novel clinical approaches will require a better understanding of the mechanisms at work within an individual as well as methods to identify the specific array of mechanisms that have contributed to the disease. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) strategies provide an opportunity to directly study the affected neuronal subtypes in a given patient. Here we report the generation of iPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons from a patient with a triplication in the α-synuclein gene (SNCA). We observed that the iPSCs readily differentiated into functional neurons. Importantly, the PD-affected line exhibited disease-related phenotypes in culture: accumulation of α-synuclein, inherent overexpression of markers of oxidative stress, and sensitivity to peroxide induced oxidative stress. These findings show that the dominantly-acting PD mutation is intrinsically capable of perturbing normal cell function in culture and confirm that these features reflect, at least in part, a cell autonomous disease process that is independent of exposure to the entire complexity of the diseased brain.
The purpose of this study was to examine the cytotoxicity and cardiotoxicity of new doxorubicin (DXR) derivatives, 3'-deamino-3'-(2-methoxy-4- morpholinyl)DXR (MRA-MT), and 4'-deoxy-4'-iodo-doxorubicin (IDXR), comparing them to doxorubicin (DXR). Both anthracycline derivatives were approximately 1.5- to 9-fold more active than DXR in inhibiting the colony-formation ability of DU145, HOS, and A2780 human cancer cell lines. Anesthetized rats given a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of DXR 10 mg/kg showed significant changes in both ECG (S alpha T segment and QRS complex widening) and hemodynamic parameters (impairment in systemic arterial dP/dtmax systolic and diastolic blood pressure), whereas animals that received MRA-MT (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) had no significant signs of acute cardiotoxicity. In this case the animals treated with IDXR 1.2 mg/kg showed alterations in the ECG as the animals treated with DXR. In the chronic cardiotoxicity study, some animals received MRA-MT (0.03 mg/kg i.v. once a week for 3 weeks) and others IDXR (4 mg/kg once a week for 3 weeks). They did not show any alteration in ECG and cardiac histological picture. By contrast, DXR (3 mg/kg i.v. once a week for 3 weeks) induced a severe cardiomyopathy, characterized by progressive widening of S alpha T segment, increase in T wave, and histological damage consisting of vacuolations and loss of myofibrils. These results suggest that MRA-MT and IDXR are more active in vitro and markedly less cardiotoxic in vivo than DXR.
