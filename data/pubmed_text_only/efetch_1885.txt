Amikacin sulfate was given to 21 febrile children with neutropenia and cancer for 9 +/- 3 days. Peak serum amikacin levels ranged between 13 and 32 microgram/mL, and trough levels were consistently less than 2 microgram/mL. Renal toxic effects were detected in two children (9.5%) and were extremely mild. Two additional children (16.5%) experienced mild, transient, unilateral, high-frequency hearing losses. The lack of serious renal and auditory impairment suggests that children are at less risk than adults from aminoglycoside therapy.
Nine patients with untreated essential hypertension (mean casual blood pressure 173/109 +/- 14/7 mm Hg) (+/- SD) were studied in the control state and after 16 weeks of treatment with nifedipine, 10 mg orally every 8 hours. Direct arterial blood pressure monitored continuously over 24 hours showed that nifedipine significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the day and the night. The variability of blood pressure was not altered by nifedipine therapy. There was no significant change in heart rate after nifedipine therapy. Chronic nifedipine therapy increased forearm blood flow and decreased forearm vascular resistance, consistent with its action as a vasodilator. The absolute blood pressure responses to tilt, handgrip and cold were reduced, but the percent increase in pressure was not altered by therapy. Plasma renin activity was not altered by chronic nifedipine therapy. At each study, the sensitivity and setting of the baroreflex response to i.v. phenylephrine was measured. After chronic nifedipine therapy there was resetting of the sinoaortic baroreflex and an increase in its sensitivity. Successful control of blood pressure with nifedipine led to a significant reduction in the left ventricular mass index.
Pb (lead) exposure and stress are co-occurring risk factors (particularly in low socioeconomic communities) that also act on common biological substrates and produce common adverse outcomes, including cognitive impairments. This study sought to determine whether lifetime Pb exposure combined with prenatal stress would enhance the cognitive deficits independently associated with each of these risk factors and to explore associated mechanisms of any observed impairments. Learning was evaluated using a multiple schedule of repeated learning and performance in female rats subjected to lifetime Pb exposure (0 or 50 ppm Pb in drinking water beginning in dams 2 months prior to breeding; blood Pb levels ∼10 μg/dl), to prenatal restraint stress on gestational days 16 and 17, or to both. Blood Pb, corticosterone levels, brain monoamines, and hippocampal nerve growth factor levels were also measured. Sequence-specific learning deficits produced by Pb, particularly the number of responses to correctly learn response sequences, were further enhanced by stress, whereas performance measures were unimpaired. Statistical analyses indicated significant relationships among corticosterone levels, frontal cortex dopamine (DA), nucleus accumbens dopamine turnover, and total responses required to learn sequences. This study demonstrates that Pb and stress can act together to produce selective and highly condition-dependent deficits in learning in female rats that may be related to glucocorticoid-mediated interactions with mesocorticolimbic regions of brain. These findings also underscore the critical need to evaluate toxicants in the context of other risk factors pertinent to human diseases and disorders.
Bilateral injection of 3.5 micrograms of colchicine into the dentate gyrus produced hyperactivity, impaired retention of a passive avoidance task, and enhanced the motor stimulant effects of a dopaminergic agonist (apomorphine) and the analgesic effects of morphine. In contrast, there was no alteration in scopolamine-induced hyperactivity. These effects were associated with a decrease in the thickness of the granule cell layer in both the superior and inferior blade of the dentate gyrus and a coincident decrease in the size of the overlying dentate molecular layer. Intraperitoneal injection of monosialoganglioside GM1 (30 mg/kg) beginning 3 days prior to surgery and continuing for 25 days following surgery appeared to limit the extent and duration of these behavioral effects. GM1 facilitated recovery of motor activity and attenuated the impaired retention of the passive avoidance task and the alterations in pharmacological sensitivity following intradentate injection of colchicine. Despite the facilitative effects of GM1 on behavior histological analysis of the hippocampus did not reveal a protective effect of this compound on colchicine-induced granule cell destruction. The results of these studies suggest that intradentate injection of colchicine is a useful model of human diseases where only restricted populations of neurons are damaged. Furthermore, these studies indicate that the use of monosialoganglioside GM1 might be a useful primary or adjunct approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and their behavioral sequelae.
Coumarin anticoagulants are known to cause hepatotoxicity, but only a few cases have been reported. Coumarins are usually administered following cardiovascular surgery and the differential diagnosis is post-transfusion hepatitis.
We report the case of a 46-year-old woman who presented with jaundice, elevated liver function tests, positive antinuclear and smooth muscle antibodies following prodromal signs of fatigue and nausea. The patient had been treated with phenprocoumon for 5 months in order to prevent thromboembolism after two strokes assumed to be due to an open foramen ovale and an aneurysmatic atrial septum.
There was no evidence of viral or other causes of hepatitis. The patient rapidly developed subacute liver failure with encephalopathy and phenprocoumon treatment was stopped. With intensive care support, as well as high-dose prednisolone treatment, she recovered. Owing to positive antinuclear and smooth muscle antibodies, the initial diagnosis 'acute autoimmune hepatitis with liver failure was made.
The lack of hypergammaglobulinaemia and the rapid recurrence of hepatitis following re-exposure to phenprocoumon led to the final diagnosis of phenprocoumon-induced idiosyncratic drug allergic hepatitis with secondary autoimmune phenomena.
In a previous study comparing fluconazole and itraconazole administered as antifungal prophylaxis in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, we found that fluconazole administration concurrent with cyclophosphamide (CY)-based conditioning was associated with fewer early toxicities compared to itraconazole. Fluconazole inhibits cytochrome P450 2C9, which is involved with the activation of CY, and so might provide protection from CY-related toxicities. To investigate this further, we compared CY and CY-metabolite data from patients who received fluconazole (n = 56) concurrent with CY-containing conditioning and in patients who did not (n = 17). The fluconazole group had greater exposure to CY, and lower peak serum concentration of CY-metabolite 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide. In a separate cohort, we examined outcomes in patients randomized to receive either fluconazole (n = 152) or placebo (n = 147) concurrent with CY-containing conditioning in a prior randomized trial. Patients who received fluconazole experienced less hepatic and renal toxicity, and had lower mortality. No difference in relapsed malignancy was apparent. These data support the hypothesis that fluconazole, when coadministered with CY, decreases CY-related toxicities by inhibiting cytochrome P450 2C9 metabolism.
The noncompetitive glutamate N-methyl-D: -aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine induces transient psychotic symptoms in man. Involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms in these effects has been suggested.
The purpose of this article is to study the effects of ketamine on extrastriatal dopamine receptor availability in healthy subjects and extracellular dopamine levels in rat cortex.
The effect of computer-driven subanesthetic ketamine infusion on cortical dopamine release was studied in healthy male subjects using a controlled study design. Dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was quantified using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]FLB 457. A conventional region of interest-based analysis and voxel-based analysis was applied to the PET data. The ketamine-induced cortical dopamine release in rats was studied using in vivo microdialysis.
Ketamine infusion reduced significantly the [11C]FLB 457 binding potential (BP) in the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortices, suggestive of increased dopamine release. This brain imaging finding was further supported by a microdialysis experiment in rats showing that ketamine increased the extracellular dopamine concentration by up to 200% in the retrosplenial cortex. Ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms were associated with changes in the [11C]FLB 457 BP in the dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices.
Our results suggest that cortical dopaminergic mechanisms have a role in the emergence of ketamine-induced psychosis-like symptoms in man. The glutamate-dopamine interaction in the posterior cingulate during ketamine infusion is well in line with the recent functional and structural imaging studies suggesting involvement of this cortical area in the development of schizophrenic psychosis.
The revealed correlation of blood pressure variation in the females who had used hormonal contraceptives and certain features of their cardiovascular histories were used to define the group of risk for borderline arterial hypertension during the intake of Ovidon or Non-Ovlon and to develop the criteria for differentiated choice of estrogen-gestagen drugs.
Potential adverse effects of estrogen-gestagen contraceptive agents on blood pressure were studied in 220 fertile women (19 to 45 years old) throughout 2152 menstrual cycles. The contraceptive agents used were ovidon, non-ovlon, rigevidon and triquilar. Blood pressure was measured prior to administration of contraceptive agents, after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of administration, and 1 month after termination of administration of estrogen-gestagen contraceptives. Evaluation of the cardio-vascular status indicated that of 220 women 212 had various risk factors for elevated blood pressure: 28 had excessive body weight, 14 were older than 35 years, 21 had a history of complicated pregnancy and labor, 2 had neurocirculatory dystonia, 54 had family history of cardio- vascular diseases, 70 smoked at least 20 cigarettes; more than on half of women (163) complained of headache of various severity. Each risk factor was assigned a rank of 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong). All contraceptive agents tested had an effect on blood pressure. The most pronounced elevation of blood pressure was observed after administration of ovidon: statistically significant increase of the systolic blood pressure was observed after 3-month administration and after 1 year this parameter exceeded the initial values by 6-7 mm Hg. During the use of non-ovlon, significant increase of the systolic blood pressure was first observed later, after 6 months, and 1 year later it exceeded the initial values only by 3-4 mm Hg. Significant increase of the diastolic pressure (by 3-6 mm Hg) was observed only after 9 months of ovidon administration and after 1 year of non-ovlon administration. Contraceptive agents with reduced dosage of steroid components (rigevidon or triquilar) produced less pronounced increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure (less than by 2-3 mm Hg). The changes in blood pressure after the use of ovidon and non-ovlon were more pronounced in women with combined rank of risk factors of 7.
Prolonged cell proliferation in response to irritation by calculi may itself evoke malignant transformation of the urothelium. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are still unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate cell cycle regulatory mechanisms in bladder carcinogenesis induced by bladder calculi. Six-week-old Wistar rats were consecutively fed a diet containing 5% terephthalic acid (TPA), 5% TPA plus 4% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)), 4% NaHCO(3), or basal diet for 48 weeks. Animals were killed at weeks 12, 24, and 48. Treatment with 5% TPA caused high incidences of bladder calculi, preneoplastic lesions, and neoplastic lesions. Immunohistochemical examination revealed overexpression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), retinoblastoma (Rb), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in bladder preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. In contrast, p16 expression was reduced or absent. These results were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. Quantitation of mRNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed a significant increase in cyclin D1 and PCNA mRNA in tumor cells. None of the 16 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) had ras mutations as examined by PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. These results suggested that deregulation of p16-cyclin D1/Cdk4-Rb pathway, but not oncogenic activation of ras, plays a crucial role in bladder tumorigenesis induced by bladder calculi.
Renal papillary necrosis has been induced in 36.4% to 75% of rats which were gavage-fed with analgesic mixtures containing proprietary combinations of aspirin, paracetamol, phenacetin, phenazone, salicylamide and caffeine. These findings support the recent recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council which suggest that the free availability of analgesic mixtures be restricted.
The occurrence of hemorrhagic cystitis with the use of high-dose cyclophosphamide is thought to be a toxic effect of cyclophosphamide metabolites directly on the bladder mucosa. To decrease both the concentration of metabolites in contact with the bladder mucosa and the time of such contact, a regimen of diuresis and frequent voiding or catheter drainage was instituted in patients at risk for the development of hemorrhage. Prior to institution of this regimen, 8 of 97 patients experienced massive clot-producing hemorrhage, three-quarters of whom died as a direct result of such hemorrhage. Subsequent to use of this regimen, only 1 of 198 patients experienced this degree of hemorrhage. Although this is only a phase II study, the dramatic decrease in the incidence of hemorrhage strongly suggests the efficacy of this regimen in decreasing the potential morbidity associated with cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins generated during the postprandial phase are atherogenic. Large very low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) or chylomicrons (CMs) are not as atherogenic as their remnants (Rem). Small and dense LDLs are associated with cardiovascular disease. Low-density lipoprotein size is partly under genetic control and is considered as a relatively stable LDL feature. In this article, we present data on retinyl palmitate kinetics correlated with the modification of LDL features in terms of size, density, and in vitro receptor binding affinity after an oral fat load. Six nondiabetic, hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) patients and 6 healthy controls were examined. Low-density lipoprotein size was assessed by gradient gel electrophoresis, and LDL density by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Low-density lipoprotein binding affinity was tested by in vitro competition binding assay on normal human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) and hepatoma cells (HepG2). Kinetic parameters were estimated in CM and Rem fractions by compartmental modeling. Hypertriglyceridemic patients showed significantly higher triglyceride area and a slower CM fractional catabolic rate. Postprandial LDL density increased both in HTG patients and in the control group with a significant difference between groups at 6 hours. Fasting LDL size was lower in HTG patients vs controls but decreased similarly in the postprandial phase. Low-density lipoprotein size and density postprandial modifications were not correlated with any investigated parameter. Postprandial LDLs were internalized more efficiently by HSF than baseline LDL only in the HTG group. In conclusion, postprandial LDLs are smaller and denser compared with fasting LDLs after an oral fat load. Postprandial LDLs also slightly increased their affinity to the HSF cell receptors.
The carcinogenic effects of combinations of methapyrilene hydrochloride (MP), nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), and phenobarbital (PB) or partial hepatectomy (PH) were examined following sequential treatment of rats. MP is a generally non-genotoxic liver carcinogen of moderate potency, NDEA is a genotoxic liver carcinogen, PB is primarily a liver tumor promoter and PH induces cell proliferation. The dose of each carcinogen was chosen to be below that causing significant liver tumor incidence when given singly. There were 12 protocols involving groups of 28 female rats each. Short treatments with NDEA and MP were followed by 60 weeks of PB promotion or by partial hepatectomy. Each treatment was given separately or in double combination as controls. Several animals of each group were killed at intervals during the experiment for examination of toxic effects and the presence of altered hepatic foci. In only 3 of 12 groups was there a significant incidence of rats with liver neoplasms: the two groups given three treatments: NDEA, MP and PB (86% tumors) or NDEA, MP and PH (33%), and the group receiving NDEA and MP without promotion (46%). The results clearly indicated a co-carcinogenic effect between NDEA and MP. Continuous PB potentiated tumor development, while PH did not. There was no evidence of liver toxicity from any of the treatments, but clear cell foci observed in three groups at weeks 13 and 33 correlated with the later development of liver neoplasms.
Paclitaxel and docetaxel are novel chemotherapeutic agents that promote the polymerization and inhibit the depolymerization of microtubules. Sensory neuropathy is common with these agents, particularly paclitaxel. We evaluated 64 patients treated with these drugs; 54 were followed prospectively. Eleven (17%, including six of the 54 prospectively followed patients) developed muscle weakness that was predominantly proximal. The weakness was idiosyncratic, occurring at any stage of treatment, had a variable course, and was reversible upon cessation of drug. All patients developed symptoms or signs of taxane-induced sensory neuropathy. Weakness was likely neuropathic in origin; electrodiagnostic studies suggested a distal axonopathy in some patients and proximal denervation (anterior horn cell or nerve root) in other.
Resistance to the capacity of insulin to suppress lipolysis may be an important link in the association between abdominal obesity and hypertension. Furthermore, a more active renin-angiotensin system in adipose tissue may contribute to insulin-resistant lipolysis in abdominally obese hypertensive subjects. We determined nonesterified fatty acid concentrations and turnover as well as lipid oxidation under basal conditions and during steady-state euglycemia with two levels of insulinemia (72 and 287 pmol/L) in lean normotensive, abdominally obese normotensive, and abdominally obese hypertensive subjects. To assess the role of the renin-angiotensin system in determining non-esterified fatty acid turnover, we repeated studies in the abdominally obese hypertensive subjects after double-blind random assignment to placebo or enalapril for 1 month each. The main findings were the following: (1) Nonesterified fatty acid flux was significantly higher in abdominally obese hypertensive subjects at both levels of insulinemia than in either abdominally obese normotensive or lean normotensive subjects and correlated significantly with both mean blood pressure and total systemic resistance during the higher level of insulinemia. (2) Enalapril significantly improved insulin-resistant lipolysis in the abdominally obese hypertensive subjects. The improvement in insulin suppressibility of nonesterified fatty acid flux at the high hormonal concentrations correlated positively with the magnitude of reduction in blood pressure. (3) Basal lipid oxidation and suppression in response to insulin were similarly impaired in both obese groups. Resistance to the antilipolytic actions of insulin is thus a characteristic feature in abdominally obese hypertensive subjects and may be linked to the elevated blood pressure in these individuals. A more active renin-angiotensin system may partly explain the insulin-resistant lipolysis in this form of hypertension.
To compare the epidural administration of fentanyl (1 microg/mL) combined with lidocaine 0.4% to preservative-free morphine for postoperative analgesia and side effects in children undergoing major orthopedic surgery.
In a prospective, double-blind study, 30 children, ASA I-II, 2-16-yr-old, were randomly allocated to receive immediately after surgery either epidural F-L (epidural infusion at a rate of 0.1-0.35 mL/kg/hr of 1 microg/mL of fentanyl and lidocaine 0.4%) or epidural M (bolus of 20 microg/kg of morphine in 0.5 mL/kg saline every eight hours). Both groups received 40 mg/kg of iv metamizol (dipyrone) every six hours. In the F-L Group, blood samples were taken on the second and third postoperative day to determine total lidocaine concentrations. Adequacy of analgesia using adapted pediatric pain scales (0-10 score) and side-effects were assessed every eight hours postoperatively.
Resting pain scores were under 4, 95% of the time in the F-L Group and 87% of the time in the M Group (Chi square=4.674, P <0.05). The frequency of complications was very similar in both groups. The F-L Group total plasma lidocaine concentrations were directly related to the dose received, and below the toxic range in all patients.
Postoperative epidural fentanyl with lidocaine infusion provides slightly better analgesia than conventional bolus administration of epidural morphine. Side-effects or risk of systemic toxicity were not augmented by the addition of lidocaine to epidural opioids.
The use of opioids in labour analgesia has primarily been as an adjuvant to local anesthetics. For early labour, satisfactory analgesia with epidural sufentanil alone is possible. This study evaluates the impact of epinephrine on sedative side effects and analgesia related to the latter technique.
After Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent this prospective, randomized, double-blind study evaluated 43 nulliparous subjects requesting epidural analgesia. The study site, a tertiary care obstetric unit, accommodates 3500-4500 deliveries annually. Group selection was randomized and blinded by selection of a sealed envelope containing a number which corresponded to a premixed labelled syringe of saline or epinephrine (100 microg/mL). An epidural catheter was placed in a standardized fashion. All subjects received 40 microg of sufentanil and 0.5 mL from the premixed syringe, diluted to 10 mL with NaCl. A blinded observer collected data on maternal sedation, lightheadedness, hemodynamics, oxygenation, and fetal heart rate over a one-hour period following sufentanil injection.
The addition of epinephrine significantly (P <0.05) reduced the incidence of sedation and lightheadedness after epidural sufentanil at all data collection points, except two. Analgesic duration was also significantly prolonged by this addition (120 +/- 56 vs 84 +/- 32 min). Maternal satisfaction was high regardless of solution.
Forty micrograms of epidural sufentanil produces satisfactory analgesia in early labour. The addition of epinephrine improves the side effect profile of this technique while prolonging the duration of analgesia. Epidural sufentanil requires attention to maternal monitoring of oxygenation as maternal desaturation occurred in both groups.
Psoriasis is a multifactorial skin disease characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation and chronic inflammation, the most common form of which is psoriasis vulgaris (PsV). We present a genome-wide association analysis of 2,339,118 SNPs in 472 PsV cases and 1,146 controls from Germany, with follow-up of the 147 most significant SNPs in 2,746 PsV cases and 4,140 controls from three independent replication panels. We identified an association at TRAF3IP2 on 6q21 and genotyped two SNPs at this locus in two additional replication panels (the combined discovery and replication panels consisted of 6,487 cases and 8,037 controls; combined P = 2.36 × 10⁻¹⁰ for rs13210247 and combined P = 1.24 × 10⁻¹⁶ for rs33980500). About 15% of psoriasis cases develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA). A stratified analysis of our datasets including only PsA cases (1,922 cases compared to 8,037 controls, P = 4.57 × 10⁻¹² for rs33980500) suggested that TRAF3IP2 represents a shared susceptibility for PsV and PsA. TRAF3IP2 encodes a protein involved in IL-17 signaling and which interacts with members of the Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family.
We carried out a meta-analysis of two recent psoriasis genome-wide association studies with a combined discovery sample of 1,831 affected individuals (cases) and 2,546 controls. One hundred and two loci selected based on P value rankings were followed up in a three-stage replication study including 4,064 cases and 4,685 controls from Michigan, Toronto, Newfoundland and Germany. In the combined meta-analysis, we identified three new susceptibility loci, including one at NOS2 (rs4795067, combined P = 4 × 10⁻¹¹), one at FBXL19 (rs10782001, combined P = 9 × 10⁻¹⁰) and one near PSMA6-NFKBIA (rs12586317, combined P = 2 × 10⁻⁸). All three loci were also associated with psoriatic arthritis (rs4795067, combined P = 1 × 10⁻⁵; rs10782001, combined P = 4 × 10⁻⁸; and rs12586317, combined P = 6 × 1⁻⁵) and purely cutaneous psoriasis (rs4795067, combined P = 1 × 10⁻⁸; rs10782001, combined P = 2 × 10⁻⁶; and rs12586317, combined P = 1 × 10⁻⁶). We also replicated a recently identified association signal near RNF114 (rs495337, combined P = 2 × 10⁻⁷).
Golabi, Ito, and Hall reported a family with X linked mental retardation (XLMR), microcephaly, postnatal growth deficiency, and other anomalies, including atrial septal defect, in 1984.
This family was restudied as part of our ongoing study of XLMR, but significant linkage to X chromosome markers could not be found. Extreme short stature and microcephaly as well as other new clinical findings were observed. Mutations in the polyglutamine tract binding protein 1 gene (PQBP1) have recently been reported in four XLMR disorders (Renpenning, Hamel cerebro-palato-cardiac, Sutherland-Haan, and Porteous syndromes) as well as in several other families. The clinical similarity of our family to these patients with mutations in PQBP1, particularly the presence of microcephaly, short stature, and atrial septal defect, prompted examination of this gene.
A missense mutation in PQBP1 was identified which changed the conserved tyrosine residue in the WW domain at position 65 to a cysteine (p.Y65C).
This is the first missense mutation identified in PQBP1 and the first mutation in the WW domain of the gene. The WW domain has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of transcription by interacting with the PPxY motif found in transcription factors. The p.Y65C mutation may affect the proper functioning of the PQBP1 protein as a transcriptional co-activator.
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory joint disease that is distinct from other chronic arthritides and which is frequently accompanied by psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) and seronegativity for rheumatoid factor. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 609 German individuals with PsA (cases) and 990 controls with replication in 6 European cohorts including a total of 5,488 individuals. We replicated PsA associations at HLA-C and IL12B and identified a new association at TRAF3IP2 (rs13190932, P = 8.56 × 10⁻¹⁷). TRAF3IP2 was also associated with PsV in a German cohort including 2,040 individuals (rs13190932, P = 1.95 × 10⁻³). Sequencing of the exons of TRAF3IP2 identified a coding variant (p.Asp10Asn, rs33980500) as the most significantly associated SNP (P = 1.13 × 10⁻²⁰, odds ratio = 1.95). Functional assays showed reduced binding of this TRAF3IP2 variant to TRAF6, suggesting altered modulation of immunoregulatory signals through altered TRAF interactions as a new and shared pathway for PsA and PsV.
To find new candidate loci predisposing individuals to Kawasaki disease, an acute vasculitis that affects children, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 622 individuals with Kawasaki disease (cases) and 1,107 controls in a Han Chinese population residing in Taiwan, with replication in an independent Han Chinese sample of 261 cases and 550 controls. We report two new loci, one at BLK (encoding B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase) and one at CD40, that are associated with Kawasaki disease at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Our findings may lead to a better understanding of the role of immune activation and inflammation in Kawasaki disease pathogenesis.
We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Kawasaki disease in Japanese subjects using data from 428 individuals with Kawasaki disease (cases) and 3,379 controls genotyped at 473,803 SNPs. We validated the association results in two independent replication panels totaling 754 cases and 947 controls. We observed significant associations in the FAM167A-BLK region at 8p22-23 (rs2254546, P = 8.2 × 10(-21)), in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region at 6p21.3 (rs2857151, P = 4.6 × 10(-11)) and in the CD40 region at 20q13 (rs4813003, P = 4.8 × 10(-8)). We also replicated the association of a functional SNP of FCGR2A (rs1801274, P = 1.6 × 10(-6)) identified in a recently reported GWAS of Kawasaki disease. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Kawasaki disease.
We extended our previous genome-wide association study for psoriasis with a multistage replication study including 8,312 individuals with psoriasis (cases) and 12,919 controls from China as well as 3,293 cases and 4,188 controls from Germany and the United States and 254 nuclear families from the United States. We identified six new susceptibility loci associated with psoriasis in the Chinese study containing the candidate genes ERAP1, PTTG1, CSMD1, GJB2, SERPINB8 and ZNF816A (combined P < 5 × 10⁻⁸) and replicated one locus, 5q33.1 (TNIP1-ANXA6), previously reported (combined P = 3.8 × 10⁻²¹) in the European studies. Two of these loci showed evidence for association in the German study at ZNF816A and GJB2 with P = 3.6 × 10⁻³ and P = 7.9 × 10⁻³, respectively. ERAP1 and ZNF816A were associated with type 1 (early onset) psoriasis in the Chinese Han population (test for heterogeneity P = 6.5 × 10⁻³ and P = 1.5 × 10⁻³, respectively). Comparisons with the results of previous GWAS of psoriasis highlight the heterogeneity of disease susceptibility between the Chinese and European populations. Our study identifies new genetic susceptibility factors and suggests new biological pathways in psoriasis.
Initial studies of the effect of chronic carbamazepine (CBZ) against cocaine-induced seizures indicated that there were genetic differences in both the time course for the development of the anticonvulsant effects of CBZ against cocaine-induced seizures and the persistence of these effects. The present studies were initiated to investigate the time course for the development and persistence of the anticonvulsant effects of chronic CBZ against cocaine seizures in BALB/cByJ, C57Bl/6J and SJL/J mice. The anticonvulsant actions of CBZ were dependent on the duration of CBZ administration, requiring 4-7 days to achieve maximal efficacy. However, once the anticonvulsant effects of CBZ were manifest, the effect persisted for up to 5 days after stopping CBZ treatment depending on the genotype. The levels of CBZ and its active epoxide metabolite were determined in plasma and brain at various time points during and after chronic CBZ treatment. The levels of CBZ and CBZ-10,11-epoxide were substantially reduced over the course of treatment in all three strains, such that the levels of the two compounds in plasma and brain could not account for the decreased susceptibility to cocaine seizures observed following chronic CBZ. These results suggest that the effects of CBZ on cocaine seizures are mediated by relatively long-term changes in one or more biological systems associated with cocaine's convulsant effects.
Systemic chemotherapy can be complicated by colonic toxicity, which usually determines the onset of pseudomembranous colitis and, rarely, of ischemic colitis in patients with cancer. This report describes the case of a 49-year-old woman with liver metastases from a neuroendocrine tumor of unknown origin who developed mild ischemic colitis after chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The patient developed symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, which resolved in about 10 days. She had a normal white blood cell count throughout her illness; the assay of stool specimens for Clostridium difficile toxins and the stool cultures were both negative. A sigmoidoscopy showed a mild, transient ischemic colitis, which was confirmed by pathologic examination of the biopsy specimens. Although carboplatin is not related to severe colonic cytotoxicity, it has been previously reported that paclitaxel induces necrosis of the gastrointestinal mucosa and inhibits angiogenesis. Pseudomembranous colitis is the most frequent complication in patients with cancer who undergo paclitaxel-based chemotherapy and develop gastrointestinal toxicity. Once C. difficile infection has been excluded, a diagnosis of ischemic colitis should be considered, especially in patients with cancer who have normal white blood cell counts.
