Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) suppresses smooth muscle cell proliferation through inhibition of the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway. Since the ERK1/2 pathway is implicated in mediating hypertrophic signaling, we studied the changes in Mfn2 in cardiac hypertrophy using in vitro and in vivo models. Phenylephrine was used to induce hypertrophy in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). In vivo hypertrophy models included spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), pressure-overload hypertrophy by transverse aortic constriction (TAC), hypertrophy of non-infarcted myocardium following myocardial infarction (MI), and cardiomyopathy due to cardiac-restricted overexpression of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (beta(2)-TG). We determined hypertrophic parameters and analysed expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and Mfn2 by real-time PCR. Phosphorylated-ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK) was measured by Western blot. Mfn2 was downregulated in phenylephrine treated NRCMs (by approximately 40%), hypertrophied hearts from SHR (by approximately 80%), mice with TAC (at 1 and 3 weeks, by approximately 50%), and beta(2)-TG mice (by approximately 20%). However, Mfn2 was not downregulated in hypertrophied hearts with 15 weeks of TAC, nor in hypertrophied non-infarcted myocardium following MI. phospho-ERK1/2 was increased in hypertrophied myocardium at 1 week post-TAC, but not in non-infarcted myocardium after MI, indicating that downregulated Mfn2 may be accompanied by an increase of phospho-ERK1/2. This study shows, for the first time, downregulated Mfn2 expression in hypertrophied hearts, which depends on the etiology and time course of hypertrophy. Further study is required to examine the causal relationship between Mfn2 and cardiac hypertrophy.
Cocaine (COCA)-induced neurobehavioral symptoms, which can be observed simultaneously with exacerbation in biochemical markers, were evaluated in mice, and compared with the changes observed in a representative hepatic failure model induced by thioacetamide (TAA). The effects of pretreatment with buprenorphine (BUP) (0.25, 0.5 or 1 mg/kg i.p.), a mixed opioid agonist-antagonist and an antidote against fatal COCA toxicity, were also examined. At 5 min after the COCA administration (65 mg/kg i.p.), the liver ATP levels were attenuated, and an exacerbation of the CNS-stimulating effects of COCA could be characteristically observed for hepatotoxicity-related neurobehavioral symptoms (changes in alertness, interest, body tension, head movement and walking). At 24 h, the ALT (alanine aminotransferase) activity was elevated, and hepatotoxic attenuation was observed for all of the scores on the neurobehavioral symptoms; this was almost identical to the symptoms observed in the TAA-treated group of mice. Recovery was observed by 72 h for all of the morbid changes. The hepatotoxic biochemical changes and the sum score for all five neurobehavioral symptoms were significantly ameliorated by low doses (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) of BUP, both at 5 min and 24 h.
With an overall prevalence of 10-20%, gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) represents one of the most frequent and economically relevant health problems of industrialized countries. We performed an association scan of >500,000 SNPs in 280 individuals with gallstones and 360 controls. A follow-up study of the 235 most significant SNPs in 1,105 affected individuals and 873 controls replicated the disease association of SNP A-1791411 in ABCG8 (allelic P value P(CCA) = 4.1 x 10(-9)), which was subsequently attributed to coding variant rs11887534 (D19H). Additional replication was achieved in 728 German (P = 2.8 x 10(-7)) and 167 Chilean subjects (P = 0.02). The overall odds ratio for D19H carriership was 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.8-2.6, P = 1.4 x 10(-14)) in the full German sample. Association was stronger in subjects with cholesterol gallstones (odds ratio = 3.3), suggesting that His19 might be associated with a more efficient transport of cholesterol into the bile.
Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) is used for unresponsiveness to other treatment for patients with stiff-person syndrome (SPS). The authors report a patient with SPS who developed acute and life-threatening baclofen withdrawal symptoms. Open surgery disclosed a small position-dependent leak in the catheter connector. This catheter failure was not detected by standard noninvasive checking methods.
Cocaine abuse causes autonomic and cardiovascular effects that may be life threatening. Attenuation of cocaine-induced seizures has been produced by the noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel complex, dizocilpine. The purpose of the present study was, first, to determine effects of dizocilpine on the incidence of pacing-induced ventricular arrhythmias and, second, to evaluate the effects of dizocilpine on cocaine-induced depression of sympathetic efferent activity to the heart. Adult dogs were anesthetized and instrumented for blood pressure and an electrocardiogram. After vagotomy and thoracotomy, electrodes and strain gauges were sutured onto the right atrium and ventricle. A left thoracic sympathetic efferent nerve was isolated and stimulated for analysis of the innervation pattern. Arrhythmias were induced with programmed electrical stimulation of the heart before and during left cardiac sympathetic efferent nerve stimulation. The control incidence of induced arrhythmias was only 2%, which increased to 21% during left sympathetic stimulation. Cocaine (2 mg/kg iv) significantly increased these to 11 and 42%, respectively. Dizocilpine (0.5 mg/kg iv) reduced the incidence of induced ventricular arrhythmias to 2% with cocaine (P < 0.05) and to 19% with cocaine and left sympathetic stimulation (P < 0.01). One or two sympathetic efferent cardiac nerves were stimulated to evaluate innervation patterns. These nerves were severed and prepared for recording multifiber efferent neurograms. Nerve traffic was analyzed by counting positive spikes for 15 s. Control activities were normalized at 100%. Within 6 min, cocaine (2 mg/kg iv) reduced the sympathetic efferent activity to 83 +/- 4% of control (n = 14 nerves).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Reversible neurotoxic symptoms were observed in three adult patients with absence status epilepticus on lamotrigine (LTG) therapy after administration of an IV bolus followed by oral valproic acid (VPA). Neurotoxicity was likely related to elevated serum LTG levels, as improvement correlated with discontinuing or reducing LTG dosage.
Ketamine is widely used as a pediatric anesthetic. Studies in developing rodents have indicated that ketamine-induced anesthesia results in brain cell death. Additional studies are needed to determine if ketamine anesthesia results in brain cell death in the nonhuman primate and if so, to begin to define the stage of development and the duration of ketamine anesthesia necessary to produce brain cell death. Rhesus monkeys (N = 3 for each treatment and control group) at three stages of development (122 days of gestation and 5 and 35 postnatal days [PNDs]) were administered ketamine intravenously for 24 h to maintain a surgical anesthetic plane, followed by a 6-h withdrawal period. Similar studies were performed in PND 5 animals with 3 h of ketamine anesthesia. Animals were subsequently perfused and brain tissue processed for analyses. Ketamine (24-h infusion) produced a significant increase in the number of caspase 3-, Fluoro-Jade C- and silver stain-positive cells in the cortex of gestational and PND 5 animals but not in PND 35 animals. Electron microscopy indicated typical nuclear condensation and fragmentation in some neuronal cells, and cell body swelling was observed in others indicating that ketamine-induced neuronal cell death is most likely both apoptotic and necrotic in nature. Ketamine increased N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR1 subunit messenger RNA in the frontal cortex where enhanced cell death was apparent. Earlier developmental stages (122 days of gestation and 5 PNDs) appear more sensitive to ketamine-induced neuronal cell death than later in development (35 PNDs). However, a shorter duration of ketamine anesthesia (3 h) did not result in neuronal cell death in the 5-day-old monkey.
The carcinogenic potential of muraglitazar, a dual human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha/gamma agonist, was evaluated in 2-year studies in mice (1, 5, 20, and 40 mg/kg) and rats (1, 5, 30, and 50 mg/kg). Benign gallbladder adenomas occurred at low incidences in male mice at 20 and 40 mg/kg (area under the curve [AUC] exposures > or = 62 times human exposure at 5 mg/day) and were considered drug related due to an increased incidence of gallbladder mucosal hyperplasia at these doses. There was a dose-related increased incidence of transitional cell papilloma and carcinoma of the urinary bladder in male rats at 5, 30, and 50 mg/kg (AUC exposures > or = 8 times human exposure at 5 mg/day). At 30 and 50 mg/kg, the urinary bladder tumors were accompanied by evidence of increased urine solids. Subsequent investigative studies established that the urinary bladder carcinogenic effect was mediated by urolithiasis rather than a direct pharmacologic effect on urothelium. Incidences of subcutaneous liposarcoma in male rats and subcutaneous lipoma in female rats were increased at 50 mg/kg (AUC exposures > or = 48 times human exposure at 5 mg/day) and attributed, in part, to persistent pharmacologic stimulation of preadipocytes. Toxicologically relevant nonneoplastic changes in target tissues included thinning of cortical bone in mice and hyperplastic and metaplastic adipocyte changes in mice and rats. Considering that muraglitazar is nongenotoxic, the observed tumorigenic effects in mice and rats have no established clinical relevance since they occurred at either clinically nonrelevant exposures (gallbladder and adipose tumors) or by a species-specific mechanism (urinary bladder tumors).
This study was performed to determine the effect of prolonged status epilepticus on the activity and subcellular location of a neuronally enriched, calcium-regulated enzyme, calcineurin. Brain fractions isolated from control animals and rats subjected to pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus were subjected to differential centrifugation. Specific subcellular fractions were tested for both calcineurin activity and enzyme content. Significant, status epilepticus-induced increases in calcineurin activity were found in homogenates, nuclear fractions, and crude synaptic membrane-enriched fractions isolated from both cortex and hippocampus. Additionally, significant increases in enzyme levels were observed in crude synaptic fractions as measured by Western analysis. Immunohistochemical studies revealed a status epilepticus-induced increase in calcineurin immunoreactivity in dendritic structures of pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. The data demonstrate a status epilepticus-induced increase in calcineurin activity and concentration in the postsynaptic region of forebrain pyramidal neurons.
Hyperglycemia increases oxidative stress in various tissues and leads to diabetic cardiovascular complication. Dyslipidemia, such as an increase in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), is well recognized in diabetic patients with hyperglycemia. However, the mechanism by which hyperglycemia causes the increased LDL oxidation remains unclear. Albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulation, and can function as an antioxidant. Therefore, we examined whether glycoxidative modification inhibits the antioxidant activity of albumin to LDL oxidation and clarified the mechanism by which this modification may suppress its antioxidant activity. Human serum albumin (HSA) was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline with and without glucose at 37 degrees C for up to 8 weeks under aerobic conditions (referred to as glycoxidation (goHSA) and oxidation (oHSA), respectively). Metal chelator-treated, nonoxidative HSA (chHSA) and freshly prepared HSA (fHSA) were used as controls. N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), a glycoxidative product, was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Oxidation was estimated by measuring the thiols of the HSA molecule. Copper-mediated oxidation of LDL was conducted in the presence or absence of modified HSAs at 37 degrees C for 6 days. Malondialdehyde and negative charge of LDL were measured. To clarify the mechanism of reduced antioxidant activity of HSA, we examined firstly the binding activity of modified HSAs to copper, and secondly the effects of free radical scavengers on the formation of malondialdehyde. CML was formed in goHSA in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Both goHSA and oHSA significantly decreased the contents of free thiol groups compared to ch- and fHSAs. The antioxidant activity of goHSA to LDL oxidation was the lowest among various modified HSAs. The oHSA showed a moderate decrease in antioxidant activity. The binding activity of go- and oHSAs to copper was lower than that of ch- and fHSAs. The formation of MDA from LDL oxidation in the presence of goHSA was completely inhibited by Tiron (1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-benzenedisulfonic acid) and superoxide dismutase. In contrast, catalase and mannitol had no effect. Our results indicate that in vitro glycoxidation of HSA induced a marked loss of antioxidant activity of this molecule to copper-mediated oxidation of LDL, which may be caused by the generation of superoxide.
The optimal treatments for relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) remain equivocal. We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a sequential treatment consisting of induction and consolidation with arsenic trioxide (ATO), peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest after high-dose cytarabine chemotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Between 2005 and 2009, 35 patients (26 with hematologic and 9 with molecular relapse) were enrolled. Induction therapy resulted in complete remission in 81% of those with hematologic relapse, and most patients became negative for PML-RARα after the first ATO consolidation course, but 4 remained positive. Administration of the second ATO consolidation course further decreased the transcript levels in 3 patients. In total, 25 patients proceeded to PBSC harvest, all of whom successfully achieved the target CD34+ cell doses, and 23 underwent autologous HCT with PML-RARα-negative PBSC graft. Posttransplant relapse occurred in 3 patients, and there was no transplant-related mortality. With a median follow-up of 4.9 years, the 5-year event-free and overall survival rates were 65% and 77%, respectively. These findings demonstrate the outstanding efficacy and feasibility of the sequential treatment featuring ATO and autologous HCT for relapsed APL. This study was registered at http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ as #C000000302.
Palytoxin (PLTX), a marine toxin identified in Palythoa zoanthid corals and Ostreopsis dinoflagellates, represents an increasing hazard for human health. Recently, dermatological problems have been associated to cutaneous exposure to PLTX during Ostreopsis blooms arising the need for experimental data characterizing PLTX effects on the skin. This study highlights in vitro the cytotoxic effects of PLTX on human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line). A short time exposure (4h) to PLTX reduced mitochondrial activity (MTT assay), cell mass (SRB assay) and plasma membrane integrity (LDH leakage) with different potencies: EC₅₀ values of 6.1 ± 1.3×10⁻¹¹, 4.7 ± 0.9 × 10⁻¹⁰ M and 1.8 ± 0.1 × 10⁻⁸ M, respectively. PLTX effect on mitochondrial activity was ouabain- and Na+-sensitive, but only partially sensitive to removal of Ca²+ ions. One hour exposure to the toxin also induced a Na+-dependent and Ca²+-independent superoxide anion production. These results indicate that among the chain of intracellular events following the interaction of PLTX with the Na+/K+-ATPase the first and crucial step is the increased intracellular Na+ concentration that triggers a sequence of cell dysfunction involving mitochondrial affection and oxidative stress, leading to an irreversible cell death. The PLTX concentrations inducing cytotoxicty seem to be lower than those of potential cutaneous human exposure during Ostreopsis ovata blooms, indicating the harmful potential of the toxin.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in hepatic stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis. We previously reported that α-lipoic acid (LA) and its reduced form dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) inhibited toxicant-induced inflammation and ROS generation. In the present study, we further examined the effects of LA/DHLA on thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis in rats and the possible underlying mechanisms in hepatic stellate cells in vitro. We found that co-administration of LA to rats chronically treated with TAA inhibited the development of liver cirrhosis, as indicated by reductions in cirrhosis incidence, hepatic fibrosis, and AST/ALT activities. We also found that DHLA inhibited TGF-β/PDGF-stimulated HSC-T6 activation and ROS generation. These effects could be mediated by the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. According to our current results, LA may have a beneficial role in the treatment of chronic liver diseases caused by ongoing hepatic damage.
The aim of this study is to verify whether the combination of glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 null and GSTT1 null genotypes, which is a candidate genetic risk factor for troglitazone-induced liver failure, is common to that for the carbamazepine-induced mild hepatotoxicity.
The genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1, and microsomal epoxide hydrolase-3 and -4, were determined in 192 Japanese epileptics treated with carbamazepine.
The GSTM1 null (GSTM1-) and GSTT1 null (GSTT1-) genotypes in the subjects were 55.7 and 39.6%, respectively. The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were elevated in 46 (24.0%) and 62 (32.3%) cases, and the mean values were approximately 2.3- and 1.8-times higher than the upper limit of normal levels, respectively. The levels of ALT and AST were significantly higher in GSTM1- than in GSTM1 present (GSTM1+) genotypes (p = 0.007 and 0.004, respectively). The level of ALT was significantly higher in GSTM1-/T1- than in GSTM1+/T1- and GSTM1+/T1+ (p = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively), and that of AST was significantly higher in GSTM1-/T1- and GSTM1-/T1+ than in GSTM1+/T1+ (p = 0.02 and 0.003, respectively). The microsomal epoxide hydrolase genotype did not influence the hepatotoxicity.
These findings suggested that GSTM1- rather than GSTM1-/T1- was a risk factor for carbamazepine-induced mild hepatotoxicity.
Effects of methoxychlor (MXC) and estradiol-17beta (E) were studied in mouse preimplantation embryos. Pregnant mice received s.c. injections of sesame oil only, 10 microg E, or 0.5 mg purified (95%) MXC on Days 2-4 of pregnancy (plug = Day 1). Another group received a single dose of 2.5 microg E on Day 2 only. Based on the average weight of pregnant females, 10 microg of estradiol was equivalent to 0.33 mg/kg of bw, 2.5 microg of estradiol was equivalent to 0.082 mg/kg of bw, and the 0.5-mg dose of MXC was equivalent to 16.5 mg/kg of bw. All embryos were collected for analyses on Day 4. MXC and both estradiol-17beta doses suppressed embryonic development to blastocyst, decreased embryo cell numbers, and caused abnormal blastocyst formation. The high estradiol-17beta dose significantly increased the percent degenerating embryos and caused a tube-locking effect, with retention of embryos in the oviduct. In contrast to estradiol-17beta, MXC at the dose used in this study did not alter tubal transport of embryos. Also in contrast to estradiol-17beta, MXC increased the percentage of nuclear fragmentation and micronuclei. In preimplantation embryos, MXC and estradiol-17beta both suppressed embryo development. MXC effects were, however, different from those of estradiol-17beta, indicating a difference in mechanism of action, possibly due to cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis.
A 23-year-old mentally retarded woman was brought to the emergency department 2-2.5 hr after ingesting an unknown quantity of mesoridazine. She was lethargic and somewhat uncooperative, but did answer questions. Her ECG was normal. She was treated with gastric lavage, 50 g activated charcoal, and 10 oz magnesium citrate solution. Her condition continued to decline until, at 2 hr after arrival, she was comatose and becoming increasingly hypotensive. Her ECG showed long runs of markedly widened QRS complexes. The patient was given an iv infusion of dobutamine to maintain blood pressure. She suffered a convulsion, loss of blood pressure, and developed ventricular tachycardia which progressed to ventricular fibrillation unresponsive to electrical cardioversion, pacing, and vigorous prolonged CPR. She was pronounced dead 6-6.5 hr after the ingestion. Antemortem blood level of mesoridazine was 16 micrograms/ml and no other drugs were detected. While sudden deaths have been reported with therapeutic doses of mesoridazine and its parent thioridazine, deaths are uncommon in overdose. Rapid death seen in this case emphasizes the importance of close monitoring and aggressive treatment of phenothiazine overdoses.
Clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by its cardiotoxic side effects. Recent studies established that metformin (MET), an oral antidiabetic drug, possesses an antioxidant activity. However, whether it can protect against DOX-induced energy starvation and mitochondrial damage has not been reported. Our results, in a rat model of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, show that DOX treatment significantly increased serum levels of LDH and CK-MB, indicators of cardiac injury, and induced expression of hypertrophic gene markers. DOX also caused marked decreases in the cardiac levels of glutathione, CoA-SH and ATP, and mRNA expression of catalase and NQO-1. These biochemical changes were associated with myocardial histopathological and ultrastructural deteriorations, as observed by light and electron microscopy, respectively. Cotreatment with MET (500 mg/kg) eliminated all DOX-induced biochemical, histopathological, and ultrastructural changes. These findings demonstrate that MET successfully prevents DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo by inhibiting DOX-induced oxidative stress, energy starvation, and depletion of intramitochondrial CoA-SH.
Tardive oculogyric crisis (OGC) is a dystonic syndrome that starts after long-term use of dopamine receptor antagonists. Atypical antipsychotics have reduced liability for inducing tardive dystonia and show antidystonic properties in patients with pre-existing tardive dystonia. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug, and there have been case reports that clozapine may be an effective treatment for tardive dystonia. Surprisingly, we found that three patients appeared to develop tardive OGC while taking clozapine. The relationship between tardive OGC and clozapine is still unknown. However, it is possible that the previous antipsychotic exposure could have created a sensitising or priming effect on the striatum. Also, there are some suggestions of an underlying susceptibility and possibly a genetic predisposition, at least in some patients.
Proton pump inhibitors, the reference standard in adults with acid-related disorders, are increasingly being used in children despite limited pediatric safety and pharmacokinetic data. This study evaluated these parameters in rats aged 21-60 days, which approximately correlates with children aged 2-11 years. Lansoprazole at doses of 0, 5, 15, 50, or 150 mg/kg per day was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats from weaning through sexual maturity. Safety assessments included clinical, neurobehavioral, ophthalmologic, and gender-specific developmental milestones, clinical pathology including urinalysis, organ weight (at necropsy), and histopathologic evaluation. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected on the first and last days of treatment. After the end of dosing, decreases in body weight gain, serum total protein and albumin (males), and microcytic hypochromic anemia were observed at doses of > or =50mg/kg per day, and hypoglycaemia (females) at 150 mg/kg per day. Selected groups exhibited increases in absolute and relative duodenal and stomach weights (> or =15 mg/kg per day), decreases in absolute and relative thymus weights (> or =50 mg/kg per day), increased relative liver weights (> or =50 mg/kg per day), and chronic adhesions to the spleen (> or =15 mg/kg per day). No other changes were observed. The area under the curve values in 60-day-old rats was less than those observed in 21-day-old rats. Areas under the curve values for lansoprazole were higher in female than male 60-day-old rats. No unexpected signs of toxicity were observed in the current preadolescent rats relative to those observed in adult rats in previous studies. The NOEL in preadolescent rats was similar to adults and gives a safety margin of one- to five-fold relative to the pediatric dose (0.87 mg/kg in 2-11-year-olds). These results provide comparative evidence for the value of studies in rats to support safety in a pediatric population.
β-amyloid (Aβ) and copper play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the behavioral correlativity and molecular mechanisms of Aβ and copper toxicity have been investigated less often. In the present study, we investigated the interaction and toxicity of Aβ1-42 and copper in the Aβ1-42 transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans worm model CL2006. Our data show that the paralysis behavior of CL2006 worms significantly deteriorated after exposure to 10(-3) mol L(-1) copper ions. However, the paralysis behavior was dramatically attenuated with exposure to 10(-4) mol L(-1) copper ions. The exogenous copper treatment also partially changed the homeostatic balance of zinc, manganese, and iron. Our data suggest that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was responsible for the paralysis induced by Aβ and copper in CL2006. The ROS generation induced by Aβ and copper appear to be through sod-1, prdx-2, skn-1, hsp-60 and hsp-16.2 genes.
4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone is a potent and abundant procarcinogen found in tobacco smoke, and glucuronidation of its major metabolite, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) including UGT2B17 is an important mechanism for 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone detoxification. Both copies of the UGT2B17 gene are deleted in approximately 10% of Whites and the deletion is associated with a reduction in NNAL glucuronidation activity in vitro. In this study, we examined the effects of the UGT2B17 deletion (0/0) on NNAL glucuronidation rates in a sample of 82 healthy cigarette smokers and further examined its effects on lung cancer risk in a separate case-control study. In the healthy smokers study, a lower urinary ratio of NNAL-glucuronide to NNAL was observed in women with the UGT2B17 deletion (0/0) as compared with women with either the wild-type or heterozygous genotypes (P = 0.058). There were no significant differences in this ratio by genotype in men (P = 0.597). In the case-control study of 398 lung cancer patients and 697 community controls, the UGT2B17 deletion (0/0) was associated with a significant increase in risk of lung cancer in women (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.0). The risk for the subset of women with lung adenocarcinoma was 2.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.3). The deletion was not associated with other lung histologic types in women and was not associated with the risk for any lung histologic types in men. The association of the UGT2B17 deletion with increased lung adenocarcinoma in women is consistent with its association with decreased NNAL glucuronidation rates in women and with studies showing that NNAL is a selective inducer of lung adenocarcinoma in experimental animals.
The present study tested the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia (hHcys) induces podocytes to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the activation of NADPH oxidase (Nox). It was found that increased homocysteine (Hcys) level suppressed the expression of slit diaphragm-associated proteins, P-cadherin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), in conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes, indicating the loss of their epithelial features. Meanwhile, Hcys remarkably increased the abundance of mesenchymal markers, such as fibroblast specific protein-1 (FSP-1) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). These phenotype changes in podocytes induced by Hcys were accompanied by enhanced superoxide (O⁻₂) production, which was substantially suppressed by inhibition of Nox activity. Functionally, Hcys significantly enhanced the permeability of the podocyte monolayer coupled with increased EMT, and this EMT-related increase in cell permeability could be restored by Nox inhibitors. In mice lacking gp91( phox ) (gp91(-/-)), an essential Nox subunit gene, hHcys-enhanced podocyte EMT and consequent glomerular injury were examined. In wild-type (gp91(+/+)) mice, hHcys induced by a folate-free diet markedly enhanced expression of mesenchymal markers (FSP-1 and α-SMA) but decreased expression of epithelial markers of podocytes in glomeruli, which were not observed in gp91(-/-) mouse glomeruli. Podocyte injury, glomerular sclerotic pathology, and marked albuminuria observed in gp91(+/+) mice with hHcys were all significantly attenuated in gp91(-/-) mice. These results suggest that hHcys induces EMT of podocytes through activation of Nox, which represents a novel mechanism of hHcys-associated podocyte injury.
Elevated nitric oxide (NO) production has been implicated in the development of morphine antinociceptive tolerance. This study was conducted to establish the temporal relationship between morphine-induced increases in neuronal NO and loss of pharmacologic activity. Five groups of rats equipped with microdialysis probes in the jugular vein and hippocampus received an intravenous infusion of saline or morphine (0.3, 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg/h) for 8 h. Morphine concentrations in the blood and hippocampal microdialysate were determined by LC/MS-MS; NO production was quantified with an amperometric sensor implanted in the contralateral hippocampus. Antinociceptive effect was monitored at selected time points during and following infusion by electrical stimulation vocalization. The data were fit with a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to obtain parameters governing morphine disposition, stimulation of NO production, antinociception, and antinociceptive tolerance development. An additional three groups of rats were pretreated with l-arginine, the NO precursor (100, 300, or 500 mg/kg/h for 8 h), to elevate NO concentrations prior to morphine infusion. Morphine administration resulted in a dose-dependent increase in NO production; the time course of altered NO production coincided with the development of antinociceptive tolerance. l-arginine pretreatment initially enhanced morphine-induced analgesia early in the morphine infusion. However, this NO-associated increase in opioid response dissipated rapidly due to a dominant NO-induced loss of antinociception. Pharmacodynamic modeling suggested that this latter effect was consistent with a hyperalgesic response. These data define a strong, time-dependent relationship between morphine-induced stimulation of NO production and tolerance development, identify specific NO-induced alterations in nociceptive processing after morphine administration, and indicate that NO is a key mediator of antinociceptive tolerance development.
Oral isotretinoin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of moderate to severe acne, but ever since oral isotretinoin was introduced as a modality for acne, the relationship between oral isotretinoin therapy and psychiatric problems, especially depression, has been controversial. The purposes of this study were to know the acute effects of oral isotretinoin therapy on psychiatric symptoms and to investigate the relationships among them, which have not been reported in the published work. This cohort study included 38 acne patients who started oral isotretinoin therapy. Individual patients were examined before administering oral isotretinoin and 2 and 8 weeks after commencement. Acne severity was graded using the Leeds revised acne grading system. Acute psychiatric effects of oral isotretinoin were assessed using a questionnaire authorized by two psychiatrists. This questionnaire included assessments of acne-related quality of life (Assessment of the Psychological and Social Effects of Acne [APSEA]), depression (Beck's depression inventory [BDI]), anxiety (Beck's anxiety inventory [BAI]) and psychopathology (Symptomchecklist-90-revised [SCL-90-R]). Acne grading and APSEA showed similar change patterns. Both improved after 8 weeks of oral isotretinoin treatment. On the other hand, the severity of depression decreased after 2 weeks of treatment. A significant correlation was found between BDI and APSEA, but no correlation was found between BDI and acne grade. These results indicate that oral isotretinoin therapy alleviates depressive symptoms. Improvements in depression are directly related to acne-related life quality improvements rather than to improvement in acne grade.
Mental retardation (MR) is frequent in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Allele 5 of a tetranucleotide polymorphism in an Alu element (GXAlu) localized in intron 27b of the NF1 gene has previously been associated with autism. We considered that the microsatellite GXAlu could also represent a risk factor in MR without autism. We developed a rapid method for genotyping by non-denaturing HPLC and assayed the allelic variation of GXAlu marker on in vitro gene expression in Cos-7 cells. A French population of 157 individuals (68 non syndromic non familial MR (NS-MR) patients diagnosed in the University Hospital of Tours; 89 controls) was tested in a case-control assay. We observed a significant association (χ(2)=7.96; p=0.005) between alu4 carriers (7 AAAT repeats) and MR (OR: 7.86; 95% C.I.: 2.13-28.9). The relative in vitro expression of a reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) was higher for alu4 and alu5, suggesting a regulation effect for these alleles on gene expression in vivo. Our results showed an association with a polymorphism regulating the NF1 gene or other genes during brain development.
Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) can replace lost neurons and improve the functional deficits. Cell transplantation strategies have been tried in the epileptic disorder, but the effect of exogenous NSCs is unknown. In this study, we attempted to test the anti-epileptogenic effect of NSCs in adult rats with status epilepticus. Experimental status epilepticus was induced by lithium-pilocarpine injection, and beta galactosidase-encoded human NSCs were transplanted intravenously on the next day of status epilepticus. Spontaneous recurrent seizures were monitored with Racine's seizure severity scale. Immunohistochemistry with anti-beta gal, Tuj-1, NeuN, GFAP, CNPase, GluR2, parvalbumin, and GABA were performed and extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) were recorded. Human NSCs suppressed spontaneous recurrent seizure formation and transplanted NSCs were differentiated into GABA-immunoreactive interneurons in the damaged hippocampus. Amplitude of fEPSP in the hippocampal CA1 was reduced, which was reversed by picrotoxin. These findings suggest that NSCs could be differentiated into inhibitory interneurons and decrease neuronal excitability, which could prevent spontaneous recurrent seizure formation in adult rats with pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus.
