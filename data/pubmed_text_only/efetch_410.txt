A 41-year-old woman, who was on flutamide for hair loss for 3 months, presented with deep jaundice. She developed hepatic encephalopathy but gradually recovered after discontinuing flutamide. Flutamide can cause fatal toxic liver injury and hence should be used with close monitoring of liver profile.
Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) are important mediators of a variety of pathological processes, including inflammation and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Cytokines and chemokines are detected at mRNA level in human and animal ischemic brains. This suggests that hypoxia/reoxygenation may induce cytokine production through generation of ROIs. In this study, we investigated the cytokine induction and inhibition by antioxidants in rat cortical mixed glial cells exposed to in vitro ischemia-like insults (hypoxia plus glucose deprivation). The results showed that interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA and protein, but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), were induced during hypoxia/hypoglycemia followed by reoxygenation in the mixed glial cells. The accumulation of IL-6 mRNA was induced as early as 15 min after hypoxia/hypoglycemia and its level was further increased after subsequent reoxygenation. Among the antioxidants studied, only resveratrol suppressed IL-6 gene expression and protein secretion in mixed glial cultures under hypoxia/hypoglycemia followed by reoxygenation. These findings suggest that resveratrol might be useful in treating ischemic-induced inflammatory processes in stroke.
Patients treated with cisplatin or carboplatin show increased renal excretion of carnitine. It is currently unclear whether this is also the case for oxaliplatin and which are the responsible mechanisms.
We investigated 22 patients treated either with a single dose of cisplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin. Carnitine and kidney function parameters were determined in plasma and urine. Inhibition and mRNA expression of OCTN2, the principle carnitine transporter, were assessed in L6 cells overexpressing OCTN2 and in 293-EBNA cells, respectively.
Renal excretion of free and short-chain acylcarnitine increased already at the day of administration was maximal the day after and had normalized 1 week after administration of cisplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin. The renal excretion fractions for free carnitine and acylcarnitines increased 4-10 times during treatment with platin derivatives. Renal excretions of alpha1-microglobulin and other proximal tubular markers were also increased, compatible with a proximal tubular defect. Direct inhibition of OCTN2 expressed in L6 cells by cisplatin, oxaliplatin or platinum(2+) could not be demonstrated, and experiments using urine from patients treated with cisplatin inhibited OCTN2 activity no more than expected from the carnitine content in the respective urine sample. Cisplatin was associated with a time- and concentration-dependent decrease of OCTN2 mRNA and protein expression in 293-EBNA cells.
All platin derivatives investigated are associated with renal tubular damage in humans without significantly affecting glomerular function. The rapid onset and complete reversibility of this effect favour a functional mechanism such as impaired expression of OCTN2 in proximal tubular cells.
The overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-Gp), encoded by the human multidrug resistant gene (MDRA), decreases lipophilic drug accumulation in multidrug resistant cells in vitro. It is still not clear whether P-Gp contribute to the problem of multidrug resistance (MDR) in osteogenic sarcoma (OS). We examined the MDR1 expression of 20 OS specimens (11 primary tumors, 10 xenografts, 1 overlapping), by Northern blotting and by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and evaluated by the relationship between MDR1 expression and patient prognosis. RT-PCR revealed MDR1 expression in 9/20 OS; 5/11 primary tumors and 5/10 OS-xenografts; northern blotting revealed MDR1 expression in only 5/20 OS. One primary OS specimen and its corresponding xenograft had similar levels of MDR1 expression. All 20 patients with OS were treated with chemotherapeutic protocols including doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate and ifosfamide. Eight of 9 OS-patients expressing MDR1 were resistant to chemotherapy and had a poor prognosis. The relationship between MDR1 expression and poor prognosis in the 20 OS-patients was significant (p < 0.01). The results support the assumption that MDR1 expression is related to MDR in human OS.
Research with animals and humans has suggested that acute and subacute use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA "ecstasy") may lead to memory impairment. However, research is limited by (1) low power due to small sample sizes, (2) the possible confound of polydrug use, and (3) the failure to consider intelligence as a covariate. The present study compared the memory performance on the Wechsler Memory Scale-III of 26 abstinent (2-wk. minimum) recreational MDMA users with 26 abstinent (2-wk. minimum) recreational polydrug users. Despite significantly greater polydrug use amongst these MDMA users, no significant group differences in memory were observed. Regression of total lifetime amount of MDMA use also did not predict memory performance after accounting for intelligence. In addition, the length of time since abstinence (at least 2 wk.) was not associated with an increase in memory performance. Greater total lifetime cocaine use, rather than total lifetime MDMA use, was significantly associated with greater decrements in General Memory and Delayed Verbal Memory performance.
Recently, atypical antipsychotic treatments have been used in children with autistic disorder (AD). However, data on safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents in autistic children are limited. In this open, prospective trial, subjects were treated with risperidone for six weeks. Nineteen children (12 male, 7 female) aged 4 to 8 years were started on 0.5 mg daily with individual titration to a maximum of 1.5 mg daily. Behavioural assessments were completed by Conner's parent 10-item index, AD symptom checklist and CGI-Global improvement. Statistically significant improvement was observed in mean total scores of Conner's parent 10-item index from baseline to the end of study (p< 0.001). On the basis of the CGI-Global improvement item, 15 children were considered responders. Statistically significant improvement was also found in some aspects of social contact, impulsive-aggression and repetitive, ritualistic behaviour based on assessment with the AD-symptom checklist. Weight gain and increase in night-time sleep were the most frequent side effects.
Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is important in ulcerative colitis (UC) by mediating the arrest and further migration of neutrophils. In vitro studies have shown that colonocytes from chronically inflamed colon and cultured colon cancer cells are capable of expressing ICAM-1. The aim of this study was to assess the ICAM-1 expression in human colonic tissue representing UC, Crohn's disease (CD), adenomas, and adenocarcinomas, with special attention to the epithelium.
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from the archives of the Department of Pathology of Rigshospitalet University of Copenhagen was examined. Colonic tissue from 10 patients with UC, 10 with CD, 32 adenomas, 27 adenocarcinomas, and 10 lymph node metastases were included. The expression of ICAM-1 was assessed by using the EnVision(+)technique (DakoCytomation).
Endothelial ICAM-1 was up-regulated in areas with dense lymphocyte infiltration and near crypt abscesses and ulcerations. Ulcerations were covered by a continuous layer of macrophages and epithelial cells expressing ICAM-1. Similar observations were made in the case of adenomas and adenocarcinomas, but in adenocarcinomas the epithelial ICAM-1 was more diffuse and not related solely to sites of surface destruction.
In the colon, endothelial cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells are in certain conditions capable of expressing ICAM-1. Although the ICAM-1 expression was related to both the degree and the nature of inflammation, the data indicate increased susceptibility of cancer cells to express ICAM-1. Epithelial and macrophage ICAM-1 might be involved in the immune surveillance and the first-line defense of the diseased colon.
A case is reported of total bilateral cochleo-vestibular destruction following instillation of Framycetin into the middle ear, under pressure, through a transtympanic drain. Toxicity of Framycetin after local use is exceptional and only one case, reported by Ransome, was found in the published literature. The interest of this observation is that, by using puncture of the foot of the stapes, it was possible to find Framycetin in the perilymphatic liquid three weeks after the injection of the product.
A 4-year-old boy developed progressive neck pain and an expansile osteogenic lesion of C2; the diagnosis was an aneurysmal bone cyst. An image-guided biopsy with 3D CT planning was performed followed by Ethibloc injection into the aneurysmal bone cyst. Subsequent CT and MR images demonstrated embolization material in the vertebrobasilar system, and the patient died of brain stem and cerebellar infarction 23 hours after the intervention. The course of events and technical considerations are discussed.
In rat sciatic nerve, relative neural toxicity and relative motor nerve conduction blockade were assessed for two amide-linked local anesthetics (etidocaine and lidocaine) and two ester-linked local anesthetics (chloroprocaine and procaine). As measures of neural toxicity, nerve fiber injury and edema were assayed by light microscopic examination of nerve tissue sampled 2 days after perineural (next to the sciatic nerve) injection of various concentrations of the local anesthetics. Both nerve injury and edema increased with concentration of local anesthetics, but injury was frequently present in nerve fascicles with little or no edema. In parallel studies, the amplitude of the electrical activity elicited from the interosseous muscles of the foot following ipsilateral electrical stimulation at the sciatic notch was monitored for up to 15 minutes to assess the extent of motor nerve blockade. The resulting log concentration-response curves were analyzed for differences in potency. Both for injury and for conduction block, the order of decreasing potency was: etidocaine, lidocaine, chloroprocaine, procaine. These results are not consistent with the proposal that ester-linked agents are more likely than other local anesthetic agents to cause nerve injury.
Recent randomized clinical trials suggest an increased risk of stroke with hormone therapy (HT), whereas observational studies have suggested mixed results. Differences in design, definitions of HT exposure, and stroke outcome may explain these discrepancies. Little attention has been paid to identifying subgroups of women who are particularly sensitive to HT.
To investigate the risk of various stroke outcomes among women using HT based primarily on estradiol-17beta (unopposed or combined with norethisterone acetate) and to assess the potential modifying effect by presence of risk factors for stroke.
Prospective cohort study.
In 1993, the Danish Nurse Study was established, and questionnaires on lifestyle and HT use were sent to all Danish nurses older than 44 years, of whom 19,898 (85.8%) replied.
Postmenopausal women (n = 13,122) free of previous major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and cancer.
Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (n = 144) identified in the national registries of hospital discharges and cause of deaths in the total follow-up through December 31, 1998.
In 1993, 28.0% of the 13 122 were current HT users, 14.3% were past users, and 57.7% were never users. Overall, HT exposure was not consistently associated with stroke. However, subdivision based on the presence of hypertension showed a significantly increased risk of stroke among hypertensive women. Compared with hypertensive never HT users, an increased risk of total stroke was found with current use (hazard ratio, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-4.74) and especially with current use of estrogen-progestin (hazard ratio, 3.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-6.76). Normotensive women had no increased risk of stroke with HT.
We found an increased risk of stroke among hypertensive but not normotensive women using HT. The present study suggests that HT should be avoided in hypertensive women.
We evaluated the role insulin plays in the regulation of hepatic S14 gene transcription using the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model. Nuclear run-on activity and mRNAS14 levels were reduced by more than 85% in diabetic rats compared to those in intact animals. After the administration of insulin, both S14 run-on activity and mRNAS14 levels were rapidly induced. Within 1 h of insulin administration, S14 run-on activity and mRNAS14 were induced 5- and 8-fold, respectively. S14 gene expression was restored to intact levels within 4 h, with overall increases in run-on activity and mRNAS14 of 7- and 20-fold, respectively. The full induction of mRNAS14 cannot be accounted for solely by activation of S14 gene transcription, implicating insulin effects at the posttranscriptional level. However, our results show that the principal target for insulin action on the S14 gene is transcriptional. Administration of dibutryl cAMP and theophylline fully blocked the insulin-mediated increase in S14 gene transcription, indicating that hepatic cAMP levels play a dominant negative role in regulating S14 gene transcription in vivo. Fructose administration to starved diabetic rats induced only a marginal 60% increase in mRNAS14 and S14 run-on activity within 4 h, while insulin plus fructose or insulin plus glucose fully restored S14 gene expression to intact levels within the same time period. Thus, dietary fructose or a metabolite generated from fructose alone cannot induce S14 gene transcription or mRNAS14 to intact levels in the starved diabetic rat. Acute effects of dietary carbohydrate on hepatic S14 gene transcription are insulin dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Two cases of mania following the discontinuation of treatment with isocarboxazid are described. Although this phenomenon has been reported by several investigators to occur after cessation of tricyclic antidepressant therapy, there exists only one isolated report of hypomania after discontinuation of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Possible mechanisms for the occurrence of hypomania and mania after withdrawal from antidepressants are discussed.
Chronic methamphetamine (MA) abuse is associated with disruption of frontostriatal function as well as deficits in cognitive control. To examine the relationship between drug use patterns and cognitive deficits, we pooled previously published behavioral data with new data collected using the Stroop Attention Test. Subject groups are composed of 38 MA-abusing individuals who recently initiated abstinence (36.1 +/- 8.8 years of age), 27 MA-abusing individuals who had initiated abstinence more than 1 year prior to study (38.7 +/- 7.7 years of age), and 33 non-substance-abusing controls (33.9 +/- 8.5 years of age). The recently abstinent MA-abusing individuals exhibited greater Stroop reaction time (RT) interference compared with both the control group (p = .001) and the long-term abstinent MA-abusing individuals (p = .01). No difference was seen between long-term abstinent MA-abusing individuals and controls (p = .87). Stroop RT interference correlated positively with both duration of drug use (p = .003) and drug abstinence (p = .05). The data in the current study provide evidence that cognitive function may improve with protracted drug abstinence.
Hematopoiesis in vertebrate development involves an embryonic, primitive wave and a later, definitive wave in which embryonic blood cells are replaced with adult blood cells. We here show that zebrafish fgf1 is involved in vivo in primitive hematopoiesis. Fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF1) morpholino knockdown leads to abnormal accumulation of blood cells in the posterior intermediate cell mass at 32 hr postfertilization. Expression of the erythroid markers gata1 and ika, normally diminishing in differentiating erythrocytes at this stage, is maintained at abnormally high levels in primitive blood cells. The onset of erythrocyte differentiation as assessed by o-dianisidine staining is severely delayed. Most fgf1 morphants later recover to wild-type appearance, and primitive erythrocytes eventually differentiate. Zebrafish fgf1 is syntenic to human FGF1, which maps to a critically deleted region in human del(5q) syndrome posing an increased risk of leukemia to patients. As its knockdown in zebrafish changes expression of gata1, a gene involved in hematopoietic stem cell decisions, FGF1 should be considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of del(5q) syndrome.
N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA; 40 mg/kg, i.p.) did not elicit catalepsy, but it potentiated the cataleptic effect of haloperidol and GABAB receptor agonist, baclofen. MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.), NMDA-receptor antagonist, reversed haloperidol- but not baclofen-induced catalepsy. MK-801 also potentiated the anticataleptic effect of scopolamine and bromocriptine against haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium-channel antagonists such as nimodipine and nitrendipine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), reversed the anticataleptic effect of MK-801, and potentiated the cataleptic effect of haloperidol, as well as baclofen. These observations indicate the involvement of NMDA receptors in catalepsy, and suggest a potential clinical implication of NMDA-receptor antagonists in Parkinson's disease.
In 16 depression clinics in hospitals and outpatient facilities in the Netherlands, a study was performed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of citalopram and fluvoxamine and to determine the difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal side-effects. A total of 217 patients with a depressive disorder (DSM-III-R criteria) and a score of at least 16 on the Hamilton rating scale for depression were randomized to treatment. The results of this study indicate that the two drugs are equally effective. The adverse events occurring during treatment show a similar pattern between the two drugs, but citalopram is better tolerated than fluvoxamine. Citalopram induces fewer gastrointestinal adverse events compared with fluvoxamine. However, this did not affect the drop-out rates.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/thrombosis (HIT/HITT) is a severe, life-threatening complication that occurs in 1% to 3% of patients exposed to heparin. Interactions between heparin, human platelet factor 4 (hPF4), antibodies to the hPF4/heparin complex, and the platelet Fc receptor (FcR) for immunoglobulin G, FcgammaRIIA, are the proposed primary determinants of the disease on the basis of in vitro studies. The goal of this study was to create a mouse model that recapitulates the disease process in humans in order to understand the factors that predispose some patients to develop thrombocytopenia and thrombosis and to investigate new therapeutic approaches. Mice that express both human platelet FcgammaRIIA and hPF4 were generated. The FcgammaRIIA/hPF4 mice and controls, transgenic for either FcgammaRIIA or hPF4, were injected with KKO, a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for hPF4/heparin complexes, and then received heparin (20 U/d). Nadir platelet counts for KKO/heparin-treated FcgammaRIIA/hPF4 mice were 80% below baseline values, significantly different (P <.001) from similarly treated controls. FcgammaRIIA/hPF4 mice injected with KKO and 50 U/d heparin developed shock and showed fibrin-rich thrombi in multiple organs, including thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature. This is the first mouse model of HIT to recapitulate the salient features of the human disease and demonstrates that FcgammaRIIA and hPF4 are both necessary and sufficient to replicate HIT/HITT in an animal model. This model should facilitate the identification of factors that modulate disease expression and the testing of novel therapeutic interventions.
In the last few years several open studies supported the hypothesis that L-5-HTP may be an effective antidepressant. Because of the lack of a controlled double-blind trial we started our own investigations to confirm this hypothesis in L-5-HTP. In 1972 we performed two open dose finding trials with L-5-HTP in combination with Benzerazide. These open studies were followed by a double-blind trial comparing L-5-HTP in combination with Benzerazide to Imipramine in 30 patients. Assessments were carried out on day 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20. For data collection we used the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the AMP-system, a Global Rating Scale of Severity of Depression and a Brief Rating Scale for the Behaviour on the ward. In this article we report only a part of the results, mainly on the findings with the AMP-system and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. During our double-blind trial we could not find any significant difference in efficacy of L-5-HTP and Imipramine. The same was found in an open trial. Furthermore the L-5-HTP results showed no difference compared with the results of an Imipramine treatment in 40 patients in earlier double-blind studies. L-5-HTP and Imipramine caused different patterns of side effects. L-5-HTP caused mainly gastrointestinal side effects and Imipramine caused mainly dryness of the mouth and tremor. The gastrointestinal side effects caused by L-5-HTP seemed to be dose dependent.
More than 2,000 arsenic-related skin lesions (as at 2002) in a few villages of China's Southwest Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture represent a unique case of endemic arseniasis related with indoor combustion of high-arsenic coal. The skin lesion prevalence was significantly higher in ethnic Han villagers than in ethnic Hmong villagers. This study was focused on a possible involvement of XPD/ERCC2 G23591A and A35931C polymorphisms in risk modulation of skin lesions and in the body burden of As in this unique case of As exposure. G23591A and A35931C were genotyped by a PCR-based procedure. Total As contents in hair and urine samples as well as environmental samples of the homes of the two ethnic clans were analysed. A significant higher presentation of A/A35931 (homozygous wild) genotype in both clans was found in skin lesion patients, compared with their asymptomatic fellow villagers (67.1 vs. 46.3%, OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.35-4.14, P=0.002). Interestingly, the population frequencies of the A/A35931 genotype did not show significant differences between ethnic Han villagers and their Hmong neighbours (47.1 vs. 45.5%). Very low frequencies of homozygous and heterozygous variant genotypes of G23591A were recorded in the residents in target village. G/A23591 and A/A23591 were detected only in 3.2% (8/244) and 0.8% (2/244) of the villagers, respectively. The polymorphic status at the locus of A35931C might modulate the risk for arsenic-related skin lesions in the investigated groups.
Two adult male patients with acute leukemia developed a fatal Budd-Chiari-like illness while receiving 6-thioguanine. Both had previously received cytosine arabinoside. Antemortem and postmortem specimens of liver showed changes characteristic of toxic veno-occlusive disease. Similar findings have been described after ingestion of certain plant alkaloids and after treatment with arsphenamine, urethane, and ionizing radiation to the liver. We are unaware of any published reports of veno-occlusive disease of the liver after treatment with either 6-thioguanine or cytosine arabinoside. Although 6-thioguanine was most likely responsible for this syndrome, it is not possible to eliminate cytosine arabinoside as the causative agent. Since both drugs are occasionally used for benign conditions, physicians should be aware of this possible complication.
The antihypertensive effect of labetalol was evaluated in 18 adult black patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension previously controlled with a combination of a diuretic and a beta blocker. After a 4-week washout period, standing blood pressure had increased from 138 +/- 2.2/85 +/- 1.5 mmHg, (mean +/- SEM) to 154 +/- 1.9/100 +/- 0.6 mmHg. Labetalol was then titrated to a maximum of 600 mg BID to obtain a standing diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 90 mmHg and/or a decrease of greater than or equal to 10 mmHg from baseline (end of washout period). By the end of the labetalol titration period, standing blood pressure had decreased to 140 +/- 2.0/84 +/- 1.5 (p less than 0.01). Following a 2-week maintenance period, standing blood pressure was 136 +/- 1.6/80 +/- 1.5 mmHg (NS vs. titration). Labetalol therapy was well tolerated and reduced diastolic blood pressure to less than or equal to 90 mmHg in 17 of 18 patients, 13 of whom required dosages less than or equal to 300 mg BID. The average reduction in standing heart rate while on labetalol was 4 bpm (p less than 0.01). Side effects were limited to skin rash in one patient and possible mild urinary retention in another. These data indicate that labetalol is an effective antihypertensive for black patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.
The role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in certain pathological states is still unclear. We have investigated the effect of anthracyclines (maximum dose, 450 mg/m(2) of body surface) on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and how it influences the level of plasma ET-1 in 21 patients (12 female and nine male) with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We also studied the association between plasma ET-1 concentration and echocardiographic parameters. Serum ET-1 was measured by ELISA. Left ventricular function was analysed by echocardiography: ejection fraction (EF), velocity-time integral, E- and A-waves, E:A ratio, deceleration time (DT) and Doppler index were all measured. Statistical analysis was made by the Wilcoxon rank test. EF and serum ET-1 level decreased significantly (EF, 56.29+/-5.0% to 48.57+/-5.9%, P<0.0001; ET-1, 6.45+/-4.0 pg/ml to 2.9+/-1.0 pg/ml, P<0.0001). DT increased significantly (179.8+/-47.8 ms to 215.5+/-66.7 ms, P<0.01) after anthracycline therapy. There was no difference in other echocardiographic parameters before and after therapy. The decrease in serum ET-1 concentration might be a result of anthracycline's direct cytotoxic effect and the decreasing level of ET-1 can play a role in the reduction of EF. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the presence and severity of endothelial damage.
Preclinical studies have emphasized that persistent small afferent input will induce a state of central facilitation, which can be regulated by systemically administered sodium channel blockers. We have extended these preclinical studies to the human volunteers by examining the effects of lamotrigine and 4030W92, two structurally related voltage-sensitive sodium channel antagonists, on acute sensory thresholds and facilitated processing induced by intradermal capsaicin. Fifteen healthy subjects received 4030W92, lamotrigine, and placebo in a randomized order using double-blinded crossover design methodology in three sessions each separated by a 7-day washout period. In each session, baseline neurosensory testing was performed on the volar aspect of the subject's left forearm. Subjects were then dosed with either lamotrigine (300 mg), 4030W92 (100 mg), or placebo, followed 2 h later by capsaicin (100 microg) injected intradermally on the volar aspect of the left forearm. Pain scores, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were measured at the time of injection and every 5 min for 15 min. Fifteen minutes after the capsaicin injection, the hyperalgesic area was determined by von Frey hair, stroking, and heat; the flare response was outlined; and neurosensory testing again was performed halfway between the edge of the hyperalgesic area and the capsaicin injection site. While capsaicin significantly decreased the hot pain and VF pain thresholds, oral lamotrigine and 4030W92 failed to alter this response to capsaicin, relative to placebo treatment. Similarly, oral lamotrigine or 4030W92 did not alter the pain scores reported from mechanical pain stimuli at any time postcapsaicin. This study showed a lack of effect of two structurally similar sodium channel antagonists on a human experimental pain model using intradermal capsaicin, which is consistent with other studies on the effects of sodium channel antagonists of capsaicin-induced pain and hyperalgesia. This lack of effect stands in contrast to reported effects of sodium channel antagonists on preclinical models of cutaneous hyperalgesia or effects of lamotrigine on clinical neuropathic pain.
Twelve children, all boys, aged 4 to 7 years, with a diagnosis of autistic disorder and low concentrations of spinal 6R-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (tetrahydrobiopterin) were selected to participate in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The children received a daily dose of 3 mg tetrahydrobiopterin per kilogram during 6 months alternating with placebo. Treatment-induced effects were assessed with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale every third month. The results showed small nonsignificant changes in the total scores of Childhood Autism Rating Scale after 3- and 6-month treatment. Post hoc analysis looking at the 3 core symptoms of autism, that is, social interaction, communication, and stereotyped behaviors, revealed a significant improvement of the social interaction score after 6 months of active treatment. In addition, a high positive correlation was found between response of the social interaction score and IQ. The results indicate a possible effect of tetrahydrobiopterin treatment.
