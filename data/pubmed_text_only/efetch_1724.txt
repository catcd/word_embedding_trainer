A 14-year-old girl with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection had fatal intravascular hemolysis after intravenous administration of ceftriaxone. Laboratory studies confirmed the presence of an antibody against ceftriaxone in the serum and on the patient's red blood cells. No evidence of sepsis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or anaphylaxis was found.
Obstructive renal failure is a rare but serious complication of pregnancy. Although most cases are due to extrinsic compression, renal tract obstruction can also be due to intraluminal precipitation of sulfadiazine prescribed for maternofoetal toxoplasmosis. The diagnosis is suggested by clinical history, ultrasound (radiolucent stones situated anywhere in the renal tract) and especially analysis of the urine pellet (wheat sheaf formation of yellowish crystals). Urinary drainage by double J stent or percutaneous nephrotomy is indicated in the absence of clinical improvement in response to symptomatic treatment and adequate alkaline rehydration. The risk of sulfadiazine crystallization must be systematically prevented by a sufficient water intake and urinary alkalinization right from the start of treatment.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation can give rise to acute hepatitis and even fatal fulminant hepatitis in patients receiving immunosuppressive or cytostatic treatment. Recently, the prophylactic use of lamivudine for HBV reactivation in HBV surface antigen-positive chronic-disease patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been reported. However, the appropriate duration for this prophylactic therapy is unclear. Here, we report 2 cases of fatal fulminant hepatitis B reactivation in HSCT patients after lamivudine withdrawal. One patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma completed 6 courses of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine [Oncovin], and prednisone) and autologous peripheral blood SCT (PBSCT). Lamivudine was discontinued 3 months after transplantation. The second patient had acute myeloid leukemia. He received induction chemotherapy and postremission allogeneic PBSCT as late intensified consolidation therapy. Lamivudine treatment was discontinued 10 months after transplantation. In both patients, HBV reactivation 2 to 3 months following lamivudine cessation led to fatal fulminant hepatitis. We suggest that the duration of prophylactic use of lamivudine in chronic HBV carriers receiving HSCT be prolonged until the patient's immune system has been reconstituted.
The monthly intracisternal inoculation of young adult New Zealand white rabbits with low-dose (100 micrograms) aluminum chloride induces aggregates of phosphorylated neurofilament that mimics the intraneuronal inclusions of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The chronic progressive myelopathy and topographically-specific motor neuron degeneration that occurs in the absence of suppressions of neurofilament messenger RNA levels in this model contrasts with the acute fulminant encephalomyelopathy and nonspecific gene suppressions that occur subsequent to high-dose (1000 micrograms) aluminum chloride inoculations. Further analysis of this unique model of chronic motor system degeneration can be expected to provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
To test two different antiemetic regimens for preventing nausea and vomiting in patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) undergoing systemic chemotherapy (CT) with ProMECE-CytaBOM (P-C).
Twenty consecutive untreated adult outpatients with histologically confirmed NHL and scheduled to receive P-C chemotherapy were registered in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study to compare the antiemetic efficacy of a levosulpiride (LS)-based and metoclopramide (MTC)-based regimen.
Complete protection from vomiting was recorded in 93% (62/67) of courses with the LS-regimen and in 89% (62/70) with the MTC-regimen (p = 0.428). No nausea was observed in 84% (56/67) of courses with the LS-regimen and in 74% (52/70) with the MTC-regimen (p = 0.183). No differences in prevention of emesis were recorded when patients crossed to the other regimen. Both regimens were well tolerated; however, on day 8 of chemotherapy, when both antiemetic regimens were administered at a higher dose, the LS-based combination showed significantly lower toxicity (p = 0.035).
ProMECE-CytaBOM-induced emesis can be prevented in most cases with appropriate, specifically designed antiemetic therapy. Both the LS- and MTC-based combinations resulted in a high percentage of complete protection from emesis, but the higher incidence of side effects observed with MTC makes the LS-based regimen preferable for patients receiving P-C chemotherapy.
Sampatrilat is a novel vasopeptidase inhibitor that may offer a greater benefit than traditional angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF). The present study was undertaken to determine whether sampatrilat improves hemodynamic function and cardiac remodeling through a direct action on the failing heart in rats with CHF following left coronary artery ligation (CAL). Sampatrilat (30 mg/kg a day) was administered orally to the animals from the 1st to 6th week after the operation. Sampatrilat reduced the mortality of the rats with CAL (20 versus 57% for untreated rats). Treatment with sampatrilat for 5 weeks suppressed tissue ACE and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activities. Sampatrilat did not affect the arterial blood pressure, whereas it attenuated the CAL-induced increases in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, heart weight, and collagen content of the viable left ventricle. To assess the direct effects of sampatrilat on collagen synthesis, we measured the incorporation of [(3)H]proline into cultured cardiac fibroblasts. Sampatrilat at concentrations that inhibited NEP activity in vitro augmented the atrial natriuretic peptide-induced decrease in [(3)H]proline incorporation by the cells. In addition, sampatrilat prevented the angiotensin I-induced increase in [(3)H]proline incorporation, whereas captopril did not. The results suggest that long-term treatment with sampatrilat regresses cardiac remodeling in rats with CAL, which is associated with improvement of hemodynamic function. The mechanism by which sampatrilat improved cardiac remodeling may be attributable to the direct inhibition of cardiac fibrosis, possibly acting through the cardiac natriuretic peptide system.
Ten subjects completed an open pilot study of carbamazepine in hospitalized aggressive and explosive children diagnosed as having conduct disorder. The subjects (9 boys, 1 girl) ranged in age from 5.25 to 10.92 years (mean = 8.27). Ratings were done at the end of a 1-week baseline period and after 3 weeks of treatment with carbamazepine. Ratings were carried out by multiple raters in several settings, using various rating instruments. The optimal daily doses of carbamazepine ranged from 600 to 800 mg (mean = 630); plasma levels at post-treatment rating ranged from 4.8 to 10.4 micrograms/mL (mean = 6.2). Administration of carbamazepine was associated with clinically and statistically significant declines in the target symptoms of aggressiveness and explosiveness. These results are promising and suggest that a critical assessment of the efficacy and safety of carbamazepine is warranted under double-blind and placebo-controlled conditions in this population.
To investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanism of octreotide on experimental hepatic fibrosis in rats.
Hepatofibrotic rats models were established with carbon tetrachloride. All the experimental rats were divided into four groups: normal control group, pre-and post-treatment model group, and octreotide-treated group in which the rats were injected subcutaneously with octreotide at the dose of 50ng/100g, twice daily, for thirty days. Serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN) and pro-collagen type III peptide (PCIII) were detected by radioimmunoassay. Hepatic fibrosis scoring grade was assessed through Van-Gieson staining and observed under light microscope. Protein expression levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) were determined with immunohistochemical staining method. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of collagen type I and PCIII were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Serum levels of HA (ng/L), LN (microg/L) and PCIII (ng/L) in pre- and post-treatment model groups were higher than those in normal control group (121.8+/-9.5 and 110.3+/-13.4 vs. 33.1+/-3.7, 85.7+/-12.1 and 78.2+/-7.9 vs. 37.1+/-6.3, 35.9+/-3.5 and 33.7+/-2.6 vs. 15.6+/-2.8, respectively, t > or = 9.41, P<0.05), and there was no significant difference between the two model groups. Concentrations of HA (55.8ng/L+/-7.2ng/L), LN (43.1microg/L+/-3.4microg/L) and PCIII (27.8ng/L+/-3.4ng/L) decreased significantly in octreotide-treated group, compared with those in model groups (t >or=2.76, P<0.05). With histological analysis, fibrotic scoring grade in octreotide-treated group was obviously ameliorated, compared with that in model groups (chi2 > or = 3.97, P<0.05). Imaging analysis revealed that alpha-SMA and TGFbeta1 immunohistological staining areas were markedly shrinked in octreotide-treated group (t > or = 2.47, P < 0.05). In two model groups, PCIII and type I mRNA levels significantly up-regulated as compared with those in normal group (t > or = 9.27, P<0.001), and they were inhibited by octreotide markedly (t > or = 2.47, P<0.05).
Octreotide can inhibit hepatic stellate cells transforming into myofibroblasts, down-regulate TGFbeta1, collagen type I and PCIII transcriptions, so that it has therapeutic effects on experimental hepatic fibrosis.
The effects of ritodrine hydrochloride on the L/S ratio, the clinical and biochemical status of the mother, and the amniotic fluid were studied in a total of 46 women between the 28th and 35th wk of their pregnancy. An increase in the L/S ratio and creatinine levels in the amniotic fluid, significant changes in the maternal serum levels of potassium, sodium, alpha 1-antitrypsin and glucose were found, whereas the urea levels remained unchanged. Maternal hyperglycemia and hypokalemia in both maternal serum and amniotic fluid, were more pronounced when the ritodrine was infused in 5% dextrose. The findings from monitoring the cardiovascular systems of both mother and fetus, agreed with previous reports. It was concluded that ritodrine hydrochloride has a positive effect on the fetal lung maturation, probably by accelerating the release of surfactant. Its administration, however, should be under laboratory control.
Isolated heart cells are highly susceptible to the toxicity of catecholamine oxidation products, namely, to catecholamine-glutathione adducts. Although cellular uptake and/or efflux of these products may constitute a crucial step, the knowledge about the involvement of transporters is still very scarce. This work aimed to contribute to the characterization of membrane transport mechanisms, namely, extraneuronal monoamine transporter (EMT), the multidrug resistant protein 1 (MRP1), and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes from adult rats. These transporters may be accountable for uptake and/or efflux of adrenaline and an adrenaline oxidation product, 5-(glutathion-S-yl)adrenaline, in cardiomyocyte suspensions. Our results showed that 5-(glutathion-S-yl)adrenaline efflux was mediated by MRP1. Additionally, we demonstrated that the adduct formation occurs within the cardiomyocytes, since EMT inhibition reduced the intracellular adduct levels. The classical uptake2 transport in rat myocardial cells was inhibited by the typical EMT inhibitor, corticosterone, and surprisingly was also inhibited by low concentrations of another drug, a well-known P-gp inhibitor, GF120918. The P-gp activity was absent in the cells since P-gp-mediated efflux of quinidine was not blocked by GF120918. In conclusion, this work showed that freshly isolated cardiomyocytes from adult rats constitute a good model for the study of catecholamines and catecholamines metabolites membrane transport. The cardiomyocytes maintain EMT and MRP1 fully active, and these transporters contribute to the formation and efflux of 5-(glutathion-S-yl)adrenaline. In the present experimental conditions, P-gp activity is absent in the isolated cardiomyocytes.
Hypoxia is a key factor in tumor development, contributing to angiogenesis and radiotherapy resistance. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a major transcription factor regulating the response of cancer cells to hypoxia. However, tumors also contain areas of more severe oxygen depletion, or anoxia. Mechanisms for survival under anoxia are HIF-1alpha independent in Caenorhabditis elegans and, thus, differ from the hypoxic response. Here we report a differential response of cancer cells to hypoxia and anoxia by demonstrating the induction of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF-4) and growth arrest DNA damage 153 (GADD153) protein specifically in anoxia and the lack of induction in hypoxia. By applying RNAi, ATF-4 induction in anoxia was shown to be independent of HIF-1alpha, and desferrioxamine mesylate (DFO) and cobalt chloride induced HIF-1alpha but not ATF-4 or GADD153. Furthermore, the inductive response of ATF-4 and GADD153 was not related to alterations in or arrest of mitochondrial respiration and was independent of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease mutations. In reoxygenated anoxic cells, ATF-4 had a half-life of less than 5 minutes; adding the proteasome inhibitor to normoxic cells up-regulated ATF-4 protein. Extracts from primary human tumors demonstrated more ATF-4 expression in tumors near necrotic areas. Thus, this study demonstrates a novel HIF-1alpha-independent anoxic mechanism that regulates ATF-4 induction at the protein stability level in tumor cells.
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a rare entity. A MEDLINE English-language search from 1966 to the present revealed no reports of acetaminophen toxicity and acute fatty liver in pregnancy.
An 18-year-old, African American woman, gravida 1, presented at 33 weeks' gestation with signs and symptoms consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy and fetal death. Markedly elevated transaminases prompted a search for other etiologies, and acetaminophen toxicity was diagnosed. Liver biopsy revealed acute fatty liver of pregnancy and toxin-induced injury consistent with acetaminophen use. The patient's condition deteriorated, resulting in fulminant hepatic failure and requiring postpartum orthotopic liver transplantation.
The combination of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and acetaminophen toxicity resulted in acute liver failure. Attention to clinical and biochemical parameters can lead to diagnosis and management.
To reduce the severity of post procedure pain associated with uterine artery embolization (UAE) for leiomyomata, we used continuous infusion of low concentration ropivacaine through an epidural catheter.
Thirteen patients for UAE were evaluated. In a patient without indication for epidural anesthesia, the pain was controlled with intermittent morphine infusion. Other patients had post procedure pain managed with 10 ml bolus of 1% lidocaine and continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at 5 ml x hr-1 for 16 hours.
The patient complained of severe pain just after UAE and required epidural lidocaine. Then, we started to infuse lidocaine or ropivacaine just before starting UAE. Among these cases, 9 patients required extra pain control using NSAIDs as a rescue. Only three patients required no medication except epidural analgesia.
Continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at a rate of 5 ml x hr-1 is not enough for pain management after UAE.
Pelvic ultrasound plays a significant role in the diagnosis of uterine abnormalities; however, occasionally the radiologic findings may be misleading.
A case of suspected uterine vessel calcification was detected on ultrasound in a patient hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease that was originally interpreted as uterine gas. The lack of change over serial ultrasound scans in conjunction with the patient's benign clinical course led to reassessment of the initial impression; the findings were then attributed to uterine vessel calcification.
Uterine vessel calcification in a polysubstance abuser may be a manifestation of the known atherosclerotic cardiovascular complications of cocaine. Although ultrasound findings may be misleading, clinical judgment is essential to rule out clostridial endomyometritis.
We report three cases of cauda equina syndrome following spinal anesthesia with dibucaine. In two cases, the lumbar puncture was repeated and additional doses of dibucaine were administered to obtain adequate sensory blockade. In the last case, spinal anesthesia worked well with single injection of dibucaine. In all cases patients complained of varying degrees of bladder and bowel dysfunction, perineal sensory loss and lower extremity motor weakness on the next day, and the diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome was made. With only one case, the symptom disappeared four months later, but the rest of the patients suffered from sensory disturbance and defecation for more than four months after the surgery. One possible cause is a direct neurotoxic effect of high concentration dibucaine due to its maldistribution within the subarachnoid space. We have to consider the neurotoxicity and dose of the local anesthetic for obtaining a safer method and for preventing this complication.
Valproate is an effective anticonvulsant. Although it is usually well tolerated, it has been associated with many neurological, hematopoietic, hepatic, and digestive system side effects. Among these side effects, hyperammonemia without clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatotoxicity is rare and is an important clinical consideration. The aim of this article was to evaluate the reasons for the unexpected symptoms observed in seven patients with epilepsy patients during valproate treatment. We evaluated seven adult patients with localization-related epilepsy who presented with different acute or subacute neurological symptoms related to valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Four of the seven patients had acute onset of confusion, decline in cognitive abilities, and ataxia. Two had subacute clinical symptoms, and the other patient had symptoms similar to those of acute toxicity. These unusual clinical symptoms and similar cases had not been reported in the literature before. Serum ammonia levels were elevated in all seven patients. After discontinuation of valproate, complete clinical improvement was observed within 5-10 days. On the basis of our work, we suggest that the ammonia levels of a patient who has new neurological symptoms and has been taking valproate must be checked. Clinicians should be aware that these clinical symptoms may be related to valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy. The symptoms have been observed to resolve dramatically after withdrawal of the drug.
Potent organophosphorous (OP) agents, such as VX, are hazardous by absorption through the skin and are resistant to conventional pharmacological antidotal treatments. The residence time of a stoichiometric bioscavenger, human butyrylcholinesterase (huBuChE), in the plasma more closely matches that of VX than do the residence times of conventional therapy drugs (oxime, anti-muscarinic, anticonvulsant). Intramuscular (i.m.) huBuChE afforded almost complete protection when administered prior to the onset of observable cholinergic signs of VX poisoning, but once signs of poisoning became evident the efficacy of i.m. huBuChE decreased. A combination of nerve agent therapy drugs (oxime, anti-muscarinic, anticonvulsant) with huBuChE (i.m.) protected 100% (8/8) of guinea-pigs from a lethal dose of VX (0.74 mg/kg) to 48 h, even when administered on signs of poisoning. Survival was presumed to be due to immediate alleviation of the cholinergic crisis by the conventional pharmacological treatment drugs, in conjunction with bioscavenger that prevented further absorbed agent reaching the AChE targets. Evidence to support this proposed mechanism of action was obtained from PKPD experiments in which multiple blood samples and microdialysate samples were collected from individual conscious ambulatory animals. Plasma concentrations of intramuscularly-administered atropine, diazepam and HI-6 reached a peak within 15 min and were eliminated rapidly within 4h. Plasma concentrations of huBuChE administered by the i.m. route took approximately 24h to reach a peak, but were well-maintained over the subsequent 7days. Thus, the pharmacological therapy rapidly treated the initial signs of poisoning, whilst the bioscavenger provided prolonged protection by neutralising further nerve agent entering the bloodstream and preventing it from reaching the target organs.
Functional and organic psychoses have been reported in association with propranolol therapy. The authors report a rare occurrence of both types of psychoses in the same individual at two different times during propranolol therapy.
Significant progress has been achieved in osteoporosis treatment, in terms of agents with novel mechanisms of action, of new schedules of administration, and of long-term treatment safety demonstration. Alendronate, ibandronate, intranasal calcitonin, parathyroid hormones, raloxifene, risedronate, hormone replacement therapy, strontium ranelate and zoledronate decrease the risk of vertebral fracture. Alendronate, risedronate, strontium ranelate and zoledronate reduce the risk of hip fracture in women with osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, and calcium and vitamin D in institutionalized patients. In two meta-analyses, the combination of calcium and vitamin D was able to reduce the risk of falling, and hip fracture risk was decreased (>700 IU/day). Two subsequently published large trials were unable to detect any antifracture effect. PTH(1-84) reduces the risk of new vertebral fracture. There is no indication that combining PTH with a bone resorption inhibitor has any additional benefit to either drug alone. Strontium ranelate is a new agent for the treatment of osteoporosis, with antifracture efficacy whatever the severity of osteoporosis. An extension of the phase 3 trials up to 5 years has shown sustained antifracture efficacy. The humanized monoclonal antibody to the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) denosumab causes a rapid, high-magnitude, dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption. Spine, hip and forearm bone mineral density increased, to an extent slightly higher than with the weekly administration of 70 mg alendronate.
Breath-holding (BH) has been used as a simple probe to increase endogenous carbon dioxide (CO2). In patients with Panic Disorder (PD), lower baseline BH duration is associated with caffeine-induced panic attacks. In this paper, we assessed BH duration in PD patients in relation to panic attacks induced by caffeine intake.
BH duration and state anxiety were assessed in 40 PD patients (12 males), both at baseline and after a 400-mg caffeine challenge test.
Patients panicking after caffeine administration (14 patients, 4 males) exhibited a significant reduction of their post-challenge BH duration, while no change of the BH duration was observed in non-panicking patients (26 patients, 8 males). Reduction in post-challenge BH duration was not related to higher anxiety levels--as reflected in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Form scores--independently of the occurrence of a panic attack. Panickers exhibited significantly lower baseline BH duration, compared to non-panickers.
Our findings indicate that in PD patients, caffeine-induced panic attacks are strongly associated with a significant reduction of BH duration at both pre- and post-challenge. Jointly, these findings suggest that in a subgroup of PD patients, sensitivity to endogenous CO2 accumulation may underlie both the lower BH durations and the caffeine-induced panic attacks. In this subgroup of PD patients, caffeine might exert its panicogenic properties through the exacerbation of patients' already pathological hypersensitivity to CO2 accumulation, as indicated by both the significant decrease of their BH duration at post-challenge and by their significantly lower baseline BH duration respectively.
To evaluate the effect of inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), by aminoguanidine, or leukocyte infiltration, by fucoidin, on gastropathy induced by two different doses of indomethacin in rats.
Rats were treated with saline, aminoguanidine (50 or 100 mg.kg(-1), i. p.) or fucoidin (25 mg.kg(-1), i. v.). Indomethacin was then given at a dose of 5 or 20 mg.kg(-1). At the end of 3 h, macroscopic gastric damage and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were assessed.
Aminoguanidine reduced the gastric damage induced by indomethacin at 20 mg.kg(-1), but increased gastric MPO activity. However, aminoguanidine did not influence the gastric damage induced by indomethacin at 5 mg.kg(-1). Fucoidin prevented both the gastric damage and the increase in gastric MPO activity induced by indomethacin at 20 mg. kg(-1), but not at 5 mg.kg(-1).
Indomethacin at a dose of 20 mg.kg(-1), but not at 5 mg.kg(-1), induced gastropathy dependent on neutrophil infiltration and iNOS-generated NO.
This study was carried out in order to investigate the potential cytoprotective effects of ozonized sunflower oil (OSO) in the damage of rat gastric mucosa induced by indomethacin and also to elucidate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and some constituents of antioxidant defense such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in these effects.
The gastric damage was induced by indomethacin (20 mg/kg) as solution in 0.5% sodium bicarbonate and given intragastrically. Three hours later OSO (4, 12 and 24 mg/kg) and cimetidine 25 mg/kg were administered also by oral route. Four hours thereafter the rats were killed and the stomachs were removed for biochemical analysis and histological study.
The gastric ulcer index was reduced by OSO and cimetidine. OSO also reduced TBARS concentration, but it increased SOD activity in gastric mucosa homogenates. In contrast, CAT activity was not significantly modified the treatment. Histological study confirmed the cytoprotective effects of OSO in rat gastric mucosa damaged by indomethacin.
It was concluded that cytoprotective effects of OSO in rat gastric mucosa are mediated at least partially by upregulation of the antioxidant system and mainly SOD.
A 58-year-old man with a history of tuberculosis had been treated with anticonvulsant drugs for a long period and presented with a small lesion in the apex of the left lung. Prior to thoracotomy treatment with isoniazid and rifampicin was started. Fulminant hepatitis developed and the patient died on the 7th postoperative day, 9 days after starting the drugs. The risk of hepatotoxicity from isoniazid is increased when it is given concomitantly with anticonvulsants, halothane or rifampicin, all of which induce microsomal enzymes.
Mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is a negative regulator of p53. In the present study, we examined MDM2 transcriptional activity and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in lung tumors with respect to MDM2 SNP309 genotypes and p53 mutation status, and the effects of MDM2 SNP309 genotypes and p53 mutation status on lung cancer prognosis.
p53-null lung cancer cells were cotransfected with MDM2 P2 reporter construct containing the TT or GG genotype and wild-type or mutant p53 plasmids for luciferase reporter assay. Genomic DNA from 306 lung tumors and adjacent normal tissues was used to determine p53 mutation and MDM2 genotype by direct sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism. Real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR was applied to determine MDM2 mRNA levels. Overall survival was also calculated.
Transcriptional activity of the MDM2 promoter containing the SNP309 GG genotype was significantly lower than that containing the TT genotype in p53-null lung cancer cells cotransfected with wild-type p53 expression plasmid under mithramycin A treatment. MDM2 mRNA levels in tumors with the SNP309 TG and GG genotypes were higher than those in tumors with the TT genotype, particularly in wild-type p53 tumors. Stage I patients with MDM2 SNP309 GG also had better overall survival than TT carriers, especially wild-type p53 patients (hazard ratio = 0.34; 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.80). Similar results were not observed in late-stage patients.
MDM2 SNP309 was associated with MDM2 transcripts, mRNA levels, and survival in stage I non-small-cell lung cancer patients with wild-type p53 tumors.
This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of hepatic adverse effects encountered with antithyroid drugs.
Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department (in- or out-patients) from 1986 to 1992.
Four patients (1.7%) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent. Two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole (Néomercazole). Two others had a mixed (cholestatic and cytolytic) hepatitis following carbimazole. One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after Benzylthiouracil (Basdène) had replaced carbimazole. Biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug, while biliary, viral and immunological searches were negative. Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutropenia.
Toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants, as for haematological disturbances, a pre-therapeutic determination and a careful follow-up of relevant biological markers. Moreover, hepatotoxicity may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents.
The syndrome of "painful legs and moving toes" is characterised by spontaneous causalgic pain in the lower extremities associated with peculiar involuntary movements of the toes and feet. It has been observed after a variety of lesions affecting the posterior nerve roots, the spinal ganglia and the peripheral nerves. The pathophysiology of the syndrome is unknown. I report a patient who developed the syndrome during treatment for schizophrenia with the antipsychotic agent molindone hydrochloride. The patient's response to the combination of clonazepam and baclofen suggests that the pathophysiology of the "painful legs and moving toes" may be linked to impairment of spinal serotonergic and GABA functions.
