Comparative effects of four barbiturates, phenobarbital (PB), amobarbital (AB), sodium barbital (NaBB), and barbituric acid (BA) on the development of neoplasms in the intestinal tract and other organs were investigated in rats following initiation with methyl(acetoxymethyl)nitrosamine (DMN-OAc). Four-week-old F344/NCr male rats were given a single i.p. injection of 0.05 nmol DMN.OAc in 5 ml sterile phosphate buffered saline/kg body weight. Two weeks after DMN.OAc treatment, the animals were provided with either tap water or drinking water containing 500 p.p.m. of PB, NaBB, AB, or BA for the remaining experimental period. Control groups received a single i.p. injection of 5 ml of sterile phosphate buffer/kg body weight and 2 weeks later were given either tap water or drinking water containing 500 p.p.m. of one of the barbiturates listed above. Rats were killed at 52 weeks or 80 weeks after DMN.OAc injection. DMN.OAc induced multiple intestinal tumors that occurred mostly in the mucosa of the small intestine, especially the terminal ileum. None of the barbiturates had any effect on either incidence or multiplicity of intestinal tumors. PB significantly enhanced the development of hepatocellular tumors as well as thyroid follicular cell neoplasms in DMN.OAc initiated rats, while the subsequent administration of NaBB, but not other barbiturates, resulted in the development of renal cortical and pelvic transitional cell tumors. This is the first demonstration of promotion of carcinogenesis in renal pelvic transitional epithelium, a cell type not previously recognized as vulnerable to initiation by DMN.OAc given i.p. NaBB without prior administration of DMN.OAc induced severe nephropathy and focal hyperplasia of both renal cortical tubular and pelvic transitional cell epithelium. No such effects were observed with either PB, AB, or BA. Our results failed to confirm the earlier findings of others that intestinal epithelial carcinogenesis could be promoted by continuous oral administration of NaBB. However, these results strongly support and extend our previous conclusions that some barbiturates have broad organ specificities and promote epithelial carcinogenesis in more than one organ and tissue.
We report two cases of patients who developed ventricular tachycardia while receiving intravenous infusions of ganciclovir [9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methylguanine, DHPG]. Worsening cytomegalovirus infection prompted renewal of ganciclovir therapy under close cardiac monitoring in one of these patients, and ventricular tachycardia recurred. The close temporal relationship between administration of the drug and onset of the arrhythmias in conjunction with the absence of other factors known to predispose to arrhythmias suggest that ganciclovir may have played a role in the development of arrhythmias in these patients. The clinical courses of the patients are discussed, as are autopsy results.
We identified, by homozygosity mapping, a novel locus on 10q21.3-q22.1 for Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS) in a consanguineous Moroccan family. Phenotypic features of GOSHS in this inbred family included microcephaly and mental retardation, which are both central nervous system defects, as well as Hirschsprung disease, an enteric nervous system defect. Furthermore, since bilateral generalized polymicogyria was diagnosed in all patients in this family, this feature might also be considered a key feature of the syndrome. We demonstrate that homozygous nonsense mutations in KIAA1279 at 10q22.1, encoding a protein with two tetratrico peptide repeats, underlie this syndromic form of Hirschsprung disease and generalized polymicrogyria, establishing the importance of KIAA1279 in both enteric and central nervous system development.
To examine our patients with brucellosis and renal involvement. Although brucellae have been recovered from the urine of patients with brucellosis, renal involvement is uncommon.
The data from 15 patients (8 males and 7 females, mean age 43 +/- 18.9 years, range 16 to 80), who had been admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of brucellosis with renal involvement from 1998 to 2006, were retrospectively evaluated.
In almost all cases, urinalysis revealed hematuria and variable amounts of proteinuria; some of the patients had pyuria. Of the 15 patients, 14 had renal failure. The etiology of renal failure was prerenal azotemia in 1, acute tubular necrosis because of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in 1, anuric tubulointerstitial nephritis due to rifampin use in 1, nephritis accompanied by brucellar endocarditis in 3, brucellar endocarditis and tubulointerstitial nephritis-associated vasculitis in 1, brucellar membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 1, and brucellar tubulointerstitial nephritis clinically in 6 patients. Hemodialysis was required in 5 patients. Chronic renal failure developed in 1 patient, 2 patients were lost to follow-up, and renal function completely recovered in 11 patients. Two patients underwent renal biopsy and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with intraglomerular infiltration of histiocytes was identified in 1 patient and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with vasculitis and immune complex nephritis features was identified in the other.
In areas endemic for brucellosis, this infection can be associated with hematuria, proteinuria, and renal failure. In addition, many diverse etiologies can play a role in the renal involvement associated with Brucella infection.
The increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in Western countries has led to an expanding interest of scientific research in this field. Therefore, a vast need of experimental models that mimic the natural pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a short time period is present. The goal of our study was (1) to develop an efficient mouse model for HCC research, in which tumours develop in a natural background of fibrosis and (2) to assess the time-dependent angiogenic changes in the pathogenesis of HCC.
Weekly intraperitoneal injections with the hepatocarcinogenic compound N-nitrosodiethylamine was applied as induction method and samples were taken at several time points to assess the angiogenic changes during the progression of HCC.
The N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced mouse model provides well vascularised orthotopic tumours after 25 weeks. It is a representative model for human HCC and can serve as an excellent platform for the development of new therapeutic targets.
Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is rare clinical entity possible owing to the diluting and fibrinolytic effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). When it occurs, it is most commonly encountered in the thoracic segment of the subarachnoid space. We present a case of a 50-year-old man who sustained spinal SAH in the cervical and thoracic segments related to anticoagulant therapy. He progressed to significant neurological deficit since he was inoperable, an observation that supports the need for decompression surgery. We should be aware of potential hematomyelia should a patient on anticoagulant therapy develop neurological symptoms localized to the spinal cord. When available, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the modality of choice to diagnose and follow-up spinal SAH.
In this study 10 of 17 patients receiving long-term amitriptyline treatment (average duration: 3.7 years, average dose: 138 mg) had their medication tapered and discontinued under double-blind conditions. Eight became depressed within 3 to 15 weeks. None of the 7 control subjects became depressed during the 6 months of the study. Those who became depressed also showed psychomotor retardation and sleep disturbance. Relief of longstanding anticholinergic side effects followed medication discontinuation. Some patients whose amitryptyline was discontinued experienced a mild withdrawal syndrome within the first 2 weeks, consisting of irritability, dream and sleep disturbance, and restlessness during the first few weeks.
This study was designed to investigate whether Resveratrol (Res) could be a prophylactic factor in the prevention of I/R injury and to shed light on its underlying mechanism. Primary culture of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were randomly distributed into three groups: the normal group (cultured cardiomyocytes were in normal conditions), the I/R group (cultured cardiomyocytes were subjected to 2 h simulated ischemia followed by 4 h reperfusion), and the Res+I/R group (100 Âµmol/L Res was administered before cardiomyocytes were subjected to 2 h simulated ischemia followed by 4 h reperfusion). To test the extent of cardiomyocyte injury, several indices were detected including cell viability, LDH activity, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. To test apoptotic cell death, caspase-3 activity and the expression of Bcl-2/Bax were detected. To explore the underlying mechanism, several inhibitors, intracellular calcium, SOD activity and MDA content were used to identify some key molecules involved. Res increased cell viability, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, Bcl-2 expression, and SOD level. While LDH activity, capase-3 activity, Bax expression, intracellular calcium and MDA content were decreased by Res. And the effect of Res was blocked completely by either L-NAME (an eNOS inhibitor) or MB (a cGMP inhibitor), and partly by either DS (a PKC inhibitor) or Glybenclamide (a K(ATP) inhibitor). Our results suggest that Res attenuates I/R injury in cardiomyocytes by preventing cell apoptosis, decreasing LDH release and increasing ATPase activity. NO, cGMP, PKC and K(ATP) may play an important role in the protective role of Res. Moreover, Res enhances the capacity of anti-oxygen free radical and alleviates intracellular calcium overload in cardiomyocytes.
Primary rat hepatocellular tumours, induced by a combination of diethylnitrosamine and 2-acetylaminofluorene, were examined for the presence of neuroendocrine peptides by immunocytochemical methods. Two-thirds of the tumours showed positive immunostaining for either neuron-specific enolase (NSE), protein S-100 or bombesin. NSE was commonly observed both in hepatocarcinomas and in neoplastic nodules, whereas protein S-100 was more frequently seen in carcinomas (49% positive) than in nodules (13% positive). Bombesin, previously shown to function as an autocrine growth factor in small-cell carcinoma of the lung, was present in neurosecretory granules in 13% of the nodules and 29% of the carcinomas. Normal, preneoplastic and peritumorous liver tissue, including the frequent atypical foci present in the latter two categories, was uniformly negative for all neuroendocrine markers. The foci, like the nodules and carcinomas, generally stained positively for the liver tumour marker glutathione S-transferase type P (GSTP). The results suggest that dysdifferentiation of altered hepatocytes in a neuroendocrine direction may be a common, late event in liver carcinogenesis which could possibly contribute to tumour formation, e.g. by establishing autocrine or paracrine circuits.
The use of [(+)-1,2-bis(3,5-dioxopiperazinyl-1-yl)]propane (ICRF-187) as a protective agent against normal tissue toxicity caused by combined Adriamycin (ADR) and whole body hyperthermia (WBH; 2 h at 41.5 degrees C) was assessed in a rat model. The effect of ICRF-187 on the antitumor response induced by the combination of ADR and WBH was also investigated in order to assess alterations in the therapeutic index of this combined therapeutic modality treatment. ICRF-187 significantly reduced ADR-mediated body weight loss, renal toxicity, and cardiomyopathy under both normothermic and hyperthermic conditions as shown by morphological and functional assays. ADR-induced neuropathy (seen only in normothermic rats) was also ameliorated by ICRF-187. Although this study did not show a pronounced effect of ICRF-187 on ADR-induced acute myelosuppression, ADR-mediated chronic anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis were reduced by ICRF-187 in both normothermic and WBH-treated rats. The effect of ICRF-187 on antitumor response was evaluated with a tumor growth delay assay using an in vivo transplantable fibrosarcoma. ICRF-187 caused no significant change in tumor growth delay induced by either ADR alone or ADR combined with WBH. Indeed, the only complete tumor regression following treatment resulted from the combination of ICRF-187 plus ADR plus WBH. Thus, ICRF-187 significantly increases the therapeutic index of the combined modality treatment of ADR and WBH by selectively reducing normal tissue toxicity without interfering with antitumor efficacy.
In a cross-sectional study of 4558 Australians, it was found that the proportion of subjects reporting indigestion, palpitations, tremor, headache and insomnia increased significantly with mean caffeine intake. A multiple logistic regression model was used to show that the association between the prevalence of these symptoms and usual daily caffeine consumption remained significant in both males and females for palpitations, tremor, headache and insomnia after controlling for the potential confounding factors of age, adiposity, smoking, alcohol intake and occupation. Adiposity was strongly correlated with the prevalence of indigestion and the apparent association between caffeine and indigestion disappeared when adiposity was controlled for. According to the logistic model, the relative risk of experiencing symptoms for people consuming 240 mg of caffeine (approximately 4-5 cups of coffee or tea) per day (the population average) compared with caffeine abstainers is 1.6 for palpitations, 1.3 for tremor, 1.3 for headache, and 1.4 for insomnia in males and 1.7, 1.5, 1.2 and 1.4 respectively for females. Further logistic regression analysis indicated that the associations found between caffeine intake and symptoms did not depend on the source of caffeine. In general, coffee consumption has no significant effect over and above that attributable to its caffeine content. If these associations are causal, then approximately one quarter of the reported prevalence of palpitations, tremor, headache and insomnia is attributable to caffeine consumption in this study population.
Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination-associated hepatitis and jaundice was first identified in 1988. Numerous case reports and case series have been published since then, but there is no precise estimate of this risk.
A retrospective cohort study in the United Kingdom to estimate the risk of acute liver injury associated with the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and compare it with the one of amoxicillin alone. Data were derived from a cohort of 93,433 users of the combination drug amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and 360,333 users of amoxicillin alone who were aged between 10 and 79 years and who were followed up from 1991 through 1992. After reviewing the information on subjects with suspected liver injury that was recorded on computer files, the clinical records of 177 patients from the attending general practitioners were requested.
They were 35 cases of idiopathic acute liver injury. None was fatal. There were 14 cases of acute liver injury among users of amoxicillin alone. The type of liver injury was hepatocellular in half the cases. There were 21 cases of acute liver injury among users of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid together. The type of liver injury was cholestatic in three quarters of the cases. The incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing acute liver injury associated with the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and amoxicillin alone were 1.7 (1.1-2.7) and 0.3 (.02-0.5) per 10 000 prescriptions, respectively. The rate ratios and 95% CIs of acute liver injury for amoxicillin and clavulanic acid together compared with amoxicillin alone were 6.3 (3.2-12.7) for all patients and 8.4 (3.6-20.8) for patients presenting with jaundice. Among users of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid together, the risk of developing acute liver injury was more than 3 times greater after a course of 2 or more consecutive prescriptions than after a single course of therapy. The risk also increased with age among users of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid together. The combination of advancing age and repeated prescriptions resulted in a risk of developing acute liver injury greater than 1 per 1000 users of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid together.
The beneficial effects of the ethanol extract of Zingiber zerumbet rhizome (EEZZR) for use in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were investigated. Syrian golden hamsters were fed a high-fat diet to induce NAFLD. EEZZR (100, 200, or 300mg/kg) were orally administered by gavage once daily for 8weeks. The higher plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and hepatic lipids, as well as the degree of insulin resistance were lowered by EEZZR. Histological evaluation of liver specimens demonstrated that the hepatic steatosis of EEZZR-treated groups was improved. EEZZR decreased hepatic mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and its lipogenic target genes. The hepatic mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î±, together with its target genes responsible for Î²-oxidation of fatty acids were also upregulated by EEZZR. In conclusion, these findings suggest that EEZZR has the promising potential to ameliorate NAFLD.
1. Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic prazosin treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.). Orthostatic hypotension was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period. The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and rauwolscine (-16%(-)-33% MAP). However, the head-up tilt induced orthostatic hypotension in the SHR treated with prazosin (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with rauwolscine (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 3. Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with prazosin at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. MAP in conscious SHR after chronic prazosin treatment was 14% lower than in the untreated SHR (n = 8). Head-up tilts in these rats did not produce orthostatic hypotension when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.). Conversely, administration of rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic prazosin treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats. 4. The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1-agonist cirazoline (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Abbott-53693 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and noradrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic prazosin pretreatment. Both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cirazoline were abolished in chronic prazosin treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4). On the other hand, the pressor effects of Abbott-53693 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in SHR with chronic prazosin treatment than without such treatment. Furthermore, the bradycardia that accompanied the noradrenaline-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic prazosin treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Sixty-five patients with symptomatic, drug-refractory, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation were treated with oral sotalol (80 to 480 mg twice daily). Sotalol was withdrawn in 11 patients because of continued inducibility of ventricular tachycardia at the time of follow-up electrophysiologic study. Therefore, the clinical effectiveness of sotalol could be evaluated in 54 patients followed up for 11.5 +/- 6 months (range 0.2 to 25). The actuarial incidence of successful sotalol therapy was 54 +/- 13% at 6 months and 47 +/- 13% at 12 months. In 39 patients who underwent electrophysiologic testing while receiving oral sotalol, the drug prevented the reinduction of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in 8 (20%). During follow-up study, arrhythmia recurred in 1 (17%) of 6 patients whose ventricular tachycardia was noninducible with oral sotalol and in 8 (44%) of 18 with inducible tachycardia but who were continued on oral sotalol therapy. Adverse effects were noted in 28 patients (42%), requiring drug withdrawal in 13 (22%) and dose reduction after hospital discharge in 10 (15%). Exacerbation of ventricular arrhythmia occurred in six patients (9%), one of whom had associated hypokalemia. Sotalol is frequently useful in the control of intractable, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and its efficacy appears to be predicted by programmed stimulation. However, there is a high rate of limiting side effects, which precludes its use in a large number of patients, and a substantial risk of arrhythmia exacerbation.
Epidemiologic studies are reporting associations between lead exposure and human cancers. A polymorphism in the 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) gene affects lead toxicokinetics and may modify the adverse effects of lead.
The objective of this study was to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the ALAD region among renal cancer cases and controls to determine whether genetic variation alters the relationship between lead and renal cancer. Occupational exposure to lead and risk of cancer was examined in a case-control study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Comprehensive analysis of variation across the ALAD gene was assessed using a tagging SNP approach among 987 cases and 1298 controls. Occupational lead exposure was estimated using questionnaire-based exposure assessment and expert review. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression.
The adjusted risk associated with the ALAD variant rs8177796(CT/TT) was increased (ORâ=â1.35, 95%CIâ=â1.05-1.73, p-valueâ=â0.02) when compared to the major allele, regardless of lead exposure. Joint effects of lead and ALAD rs2761016 suggest an increased RCC risk for the homozygous wild-type and heterozygous alleles ((GG)ORâ=â2.68, 95%CIâ=â1.17-6.12, pâ=â0.01; (GA)ORâ=â1.79, 95%CIâ=â1.06-3.04 with an interaction approaching significance (p(int)â=â0.06). No significant modification in RCC risk was observed for the functional variant rs1800435(K68N). Haplotype analysis identified a region associated with risk supporting tagging SNP results.
A common genetic variation in ALAD may alter the risk of RCC overall, and among individuals occupationally exposed to lead. Further work in larger exposed populations is warranted to determine if ALAD modifies RCC risk associated with lead exposure.
Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure (ALF) remains a major clinical problem. Although a majority of patients recovers after severe liver injury, a subpopulation of patients proceeds to ALF. Bile acids are generated in the liver and accumulate in blood during liver injury, and as such, have been proposed as biomarkers for liver injury and dysfunction. The goal of this study was to determine whether individual bile acid levels could determine outcome in patients with APAP-induced ALF (AALF). Serum bile acid levels were measured in AALF patients using mass spectrometry. Bile acid levels were elevated 5-80-fold above control values in injured patients on day 1 after the overdose and decreased over the course of hospital stay. Interestingly, glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) was significantly increased in non-surviving AALF patients compared with survivors. GDCA values obtained at peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and from day 1 of admission indicated GDCA could predict survival in these patients by receiver-operating characteristic analysis (AUCâ=â0.70 for day 1, AUCâ=â0.68 for peak ALT). Of note, AALF patients also had significantly higher levels of serum bile acids than patients with active cholestatic liver injury. These data suggest measurements of GDCA in this patient cohort modestly predicted outcome and may serve as a prognostic biomarker. Furthermore, accumulation of bile acids in serum or plasma may be a result of liver cell dysfunction and not cholestasis, suggesting elevation of circulating bile acid levels may be a consequence and not a cause of liver injury.
Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are common replacements for the phased-out polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and have been detected at high concentrations in environmental samples. OPFRs are structurally similar to organophosphate pesticides and may adversely affect the developing nervous system. This study evaluated the overt toxicity, uptake, and neurobehavioral effects of tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), and tris (2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (TDBPP) in early life stage zebrafish. Chlorpyrifos was used as a positive control. For overt toxicity and neurobehavioral assessments, zebrafish were exposed from 0 to 5 days postfertilization (dpf). Hatching, death, or malformations were evaluated daily. Teratogenic effects were scored by visual examination on 6 dpf. To evaluate uptake and metabolism, zebrafish were exposed to 1âÂµM of each organophosphate (OP) flame retardant and collected on 1 and 5 dpf to monitor accumulation. Larval swimming activity was measured in 6 dpf larvae to evaluate neurobehavioral effects of exposures below the acute toxicity threshold. TDBPP elicited the greatest toxicity at >1âÂµM. TDCPP and chlorpyrifos were overtly toxic at concentrations â¥10âÂµM, TCEP, and TCPP were not overtly toxic at the doses tested. Tissue concentrations increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the parent chemical after 24âh exposures. TDCPP and TDBPP and their respective metabolites were detected in embryos on 5 dpf. For all chemicals tested, developmental exposures that were not overtly toxic significantly altered larval swimming activity. These data indicate that OPFRs adversely affect development of early life stage zebrafish.
Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are the most common gynecological neoplasms and may be associated with significant morbidity. Recently, we described a rat model (Eker rat) of fibroid development in which reproductive tract leiomyomas develop spontaneously with high frequency. The present studies describe the estrogen and antiestrogen responsiveness of an Eker rat leiomyoma-derived cell line in vitro and a nude mouse xenograft system in vivo. In this cell line, estradiol stimulated growth in estrogen-depleted medium, whereas the nonsteroidal antiestrogen tamoxifen maximally inhibited cell proliferation in medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum. Proliferation was also decreased by the biologically active tamoxifen metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen; the metabolite was more effective than the parent compound in exerting this growth inhibition. Compared to placebo-treated controls, estradiol increased the size of tumors that developed in a nude mouse xenograft system, whereas tamoxifen increased tumor latency and decreased tumor size. This study of leiomyoma cells in a well defined system suggests that antiestrogens may prove efficacious in the treatment of this clinically important neoplasm.
In utero exposure of rat embryos to dimethadione (DMO), the N-demethylated teratogenic metabolite of the anticonvulsant trimethadione, induces a high incidence of cardiac heart defects including ventricular septal defects (VSDs). The same exposure regimen also leads to in utero cardiac functional deficits, including bradycardia, dysrhythmia, and a reduction in cardiac output (CO) and ejection fraction that persist until parturition (10 days after the final dose). Despite a high rate of spontaneous postnatal VSD closure, we hypothesize that functional sequelae will persist into adulthood. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were administered six 300âmg/kg doses of DMO, one every 12âh in mid-pregnancy beginning on the evening of gestation day 8. Postnatal cardiac function was assessed in control (CTL) and DMO-exposed offspring using radiotelemetry and ultrasound at 3 and 11 months of age, respectively. Adult rats exposed to DMO in utero had an increased incidence of arrhythmia, elevated blood pressure and CO, greater left ventricular volume and elevated locomotor activity versus CTL. The mean arterial pressure of DMO-exposed rats was more sensitive to changes in dietary salt load compared with CTL. Importantly, most treated rats had functional deficits in the absence of a persistent structural defect. It was concluded that in utero DMO exposure causes cardiovascular deficits that persist into postnatal life in the rat, despite absence of visible structural anomalies. We speculate this is not unique to DMO, suggesting possible health implications for infants with unrecognized gestational chemical exposures.
Osteosarcomas have many established risk factors, both genetic and environmental, but by themselves these explain only part of the total cancer incidence. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental estrogen associated with risk of several kinds of tumour. The lysyl oxidase gene (LOX) may also contribute to risk of tumours including osteosarcomas. Here, we investigated possible interactions of BPA and a LOX polymorphism on the risk of osteosarcoma.
The present hospital-based case-control study included 106 cancer patients and 112 controls from a Chinese population. Internal burden of BPA exposure was assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) method. Genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP methods.
Compared with those in low BPA exposure group, subjects with BPA more than or equal to median value had significant increased risk of osteosarcoma among subjects who carried GC or CC genotypes. A significant interaction with BPA level and the -22 G/C polymorphism was observed for osteosarcoma overall, osteosarcoma affecting knee and osteosarcoma affecting hip, as P(forinteraction) = 0.036 for osteosarcoma overall; P(forinteraction) = 0.024 for osteosarcoma affecting knee; and P(forinteraction) = 0.017 for osteosarcoma affecting hip.
The results suggest that BPA exposure interacts with the -22 G/C polymorphism of the LOX gene to increase the risk of osteosarcoma.
Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC) has been used for years as a fungicide and bactericide for wood and paint preservation without any reports of cutaneous side-effects. During the last few years, it has entered cosmetic products and is temporarily permitted in the EU Cosmetics Directive in a use concentration of 0.1%. In the present study, we report our preliminary experience with patch testing consecutive contact dermatitis patients with IPBC. A patch test concentration of 0.1% seems appropriate for initial screening but deserves further evaluation. Among 311 consecutive patch test patients, 3 patients with a positive patch test to IPBC have been identified. Contact allergy is likely in at least 1 case, based on clinical history, exposure history, patch testing with dilution series, ROAT and chemical analysis.
Insulin resistance is a feature of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Inverse correlations between indexes of insulin sensitivity and serum markers of inflammation have been observed and, particularly, TNF-alpha has been shown to be associated with the appearance of insulin resistance in pregnancy. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a protein member of the collectin family. Its deficiency is genetically determined and predisposes to recurrent infections and chronic inflammatory diseases. To test the hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to a proinflammatory state could favor the appearance of GDM during pregnancy, we studied R52C and G54D polymorphisms of MBL2 gene and plasma MBL levels from 105 consecutive GDM women and 173 healthy pregnant women. An association was found between G54D and GDM [odds ratio, 2.03 (1.18-3.49); P < 0.01], and this association remained significant when the presence of both mutated alleles was considered [odds ratio, 1.76 (1.04-2.96); P < 0.05] but not for the R52C. GDM patients who carried the G54D mutation required insulin therapy more frequently (56.4 vs. 30.4%, chi(2) =5.83; P = 0.027) and had heavier infants (3326.4 +/- 546.9 vs. 3087.5 +/- 395.5 g; P < 0.05) than GDM women homozygous for the wild-type allele. An inverse correlation in GDM patients between neonatal weight and plasma MBL levels (r = -0.320; P = 0.002) was found, remaining significant after adjustment for confounding variables. In conclusion, pregnant women bearing the G54D MBL allele have a greater risk for developing GDM and having heavier infants.
Antiarrhythmic effects of intravenous coronary vasodilators (verapamil, diltiazem, bepridil, trimetazidine and nicorandil) were evaluated using two canine ventricular arrhythmia models (halothane-adrenaline arrhythmia and digitalis arrhythmia), and the minimum effective plasma concentrations of the drugs were determined for each arrhythmia model. Verapamil (0.1 mg/kg), diltiazem (0.1 mg/kg), bepridil (1 mg/kg) and high dose trimetazidine (10 mg/kg) were effective on halothane-adrenaline arrhythmia; and the minimum effective plasma concentrations of the above drugs were less than 30 +/- 10 ng/ml, less than 18 +/- 5 ng/ml, 0.38 +/- 0.11 microgram/ml and 7.0 +/- 1.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Nicorandil (1 mg/kg) did not suppress halothane-adrenaline arrhythmia. Verapamil, diltiazem and bepridil must have suppressed the halothane-adrenaline arrhythmia by blocking the Ca channel. Verapamil (1 mg/kg), diltiazem (1 mg/kg), bepridil (5 mg/kg), trimetazidine (3 mg/kg) and nicorandil (3 mg/kg) were ineffective on digitalis arrhythmia, even though their maximum hypotensive doses were used.
Studies on the neurocognitive effects of cocaine abuse are equivocal with respect to the specific types of deficits observed, although the vast majority of studies indicate that at least some deficits in certain broad functions such as attention, learning and memory, executive functions, and response speed exist. All of these studies based their results on null hypothesis statistical significance testing (NHSST). It is argued that effect size analysis, which provides information about the magnitude of difference, offers a more valid index of cognitive impairments in a population when compared to NHSST. Accordingly, the objective of the current study was to conduct an effect size analysis (or a meta-analysis in cases where the same test measure was utilized in more than one study) to determine the type and the magnitude of the specific cognitive deficits found as a result of cocaine use. Effect sizes were calculated for each test variable across 15 empirical studies that met inclusion criteria. The results from 481 cocaine users and 586 healthy normal controls revealed that cocaine use had the largest effect on several measures of attention (0.40 < d < 1.10). Moderate to large effect sizes (d > 0.50) were also obtained on tests of visual memory and working memory. Minimal effect sizes (d < 0.30) were obtained on tests of verbal fluency and other language functions and sensory-perceptual functions. Tests of executive functioning produced mixed findings and were interpreted in terms of degree rather than nature of impairment. The results are consistent with findings from neuroimaging and neurochemical studies that have found cocaine use to be associated with dysfunctions in the anterior cingulate gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex; these regions are highly implicated in the mediation of attentional and executive functions, respectively. Methodological limitations of the empirical studies included in the analysis are discussed.
Lenalidomide, a highly potent immunomodulatory derivative of thalidomide, potentiates the action of paclitaxel in vitro against prostate cancer cell lines in co-culture with mononuclear cells. A modular Phase I study of lenalidomide and paclitaxel in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) was conducted to assess PSA kinetics with lead-in lenalidomide and the feasibility of the combination.
Men with metastatic CRPC with prior taxane chemotherapy were planned for single-agent "lead-in" lenalidomide for 21/28 days at dose-levels: -1 (5 mg), 0 (10 mg), +1 (15 mg), +2 (20 mg), +3 (25 mg); followed by lenalidomide at the same dose and schedule in combination with weekly intravenous paclitaxel 100 mg/m(2) over 3 h on days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days utilizing a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design.
Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 4/6 patients with first-cycle combination therapy at the 10 mg dose-level and 3/6 patients at the 5 mg dose-level of lenalidomide, respectively. These included Grade 3 neutropenia precluding planned paclitaxel therapy (n = 3), grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (n = 2), chest pain (n = 1) and pulmonary embolism (n = 1). With lead-in lenalidomide, two patients with lymph-node dominant CRPC had a PSA-decline and regression in lymph node disease, respectively. Two of seven evaluable patients had PSA declines by 50% with combination therapy. Progression-free survival was 13 weeks (range 4-35 weeks).
The high dose-limiting toxicity rates observed with lenalidomide and weekly paclitaxel require exploration of alternate dose-schedules of the combination in the second-line setting of CRPC. These early observations suggest distinctive toxicity and efficacy outcomes from thalidomide in combination with paclitaxel.
