To report 4 cases of propythiouracil (PTU)-induced lupus or vasculitis and to review the literature on that subject.
We describe the clinical presentation, course, and outcome of 4 patients and review the medical literature registered in the Medline PubMed database from 1966 to 2004 by using the keywords: Graves, thyrotoxicosis, propylthiouracil, lupus, vasculitis, arthritis, rash, ANA, and ANCA. Cases were classified into drug-induced lupus (DIL) or vasculitis using accepted definitions and evaluated with emphasis on gender, age, origin, duration of treatment, delay in diagnosis, clinical and serological features, and outcome.
We described our 4 patients and analyzed 42 well-documented cases of DIL- and PTU-induced vasculitis (30 had vasculitis and 12 fulfilled the classification criteria of DIL). Patients with vasculitis were significantly older (mean 43 versus 22 years) and had a longer duration of treatment in comparison with DIL (35 versus 24 weeks). Musculoskeletal symptoms were prominent in DIL, while renal and pulmonary involvement was found in a significantly higher proportion of PTU-induced vasculitis. ANA, anti-DNA, and anti-histone were predominantly found in DIL, while p-ANCA was found in a similar proportion of patients in both groups. c-ANCA was detected only in patients with vasculitis. All patients with DIL completely recovered (most after stopping PTU), while about 50% of PTU-induced vasculitis needed steroids or immunosuppressive drugs, including cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis.
Most of the cases of PTU-induced autoimmune phenomena are due to vasculitis. Despite the common presence of p-ANCA in both DIL- and PTU-induced vasculitis, substantial differences in demographic, clinical, and outcome features of these entities allow an accurate diagnosis and consequent management.
A 64-year-old male was treated continuously with rifampin, isoniazid and streptomycin for pulmonary atypical mycobacteriosis, Mycobacterium kansasii. Five weeks after beginning the treatment, the patient suddenly developed acute renal failure. A renal biopsy showed crescentic lesions characteristic of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with moderate interstitial changes. Serum antirifampin antibody was detected, and the cessation of rifampin treatment was followed by a rapid spontaneous recovery of the patient's renal function. This is, to our knowledge, the first case of rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with rifampin treatment where circulating antirifampin antibody is demonstrated and the renal function spontaneously improved after discontinuing rifampin treatment.
The potentially beneficial hemodynamic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in heart failure may relate, in part, to their ability to increase the production of vasodilator prostanoids. Low dose aspirin is commonly prescribed in CHF and may attenuate the vasodilator effects of ACE inhibitors. We sought to determine the effects of low dose aspirin on the peripheral hemodynamic effects of captopril in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).
Nine patients with chronic heart failure were randomized in a placebo controlled, cross over study, to 75 mg of aspirin daily or placebo. After 7 days treatment the response to 25 mg of captopril was evaluated over 180 min using venous occlusion plethysmography. Forearm blood flow (FBF) and forearm venous capacitance (FVC) were measured.
Mean arterial pressure and heart rate did not change. After placebo, FBF increased in response to captopril (+18%, 95%CI 24.2, 11.8), a response inhibited by aspirin (-1.4%, 2.9, -5.7), p < 0.005. After placebo, FVC increased in response to captopril (+7.6%, 9.8, 5.4), which was also inhibited by aspirin (+2.0%, 4.6, -0.6), aspirin vs. placebo, p = 0.02).
In patients with chronic heart failure even low dose aspirin inhibits both the acute arterial and venous dilator responses to captopril. This action of aspirin may reduce the long-term clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors.
The main cause of azathioprine (AZA)/6-mercaptopurine (6MP)-induced adverse reactions is a reduction in the activities of the metabolizing enzymes thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPA). Adverse reactions develop at a high frequency in Japanese patients at half the dose required for European and American patients; however, the association with TPMT and ITPA gene polymorphisms in Japanese has not been fully investigated.
Gene mutations of TPMT and ITPA, the major AZA/6-MP -metabolizing enzymes, were investigated retrospectively in 16 Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in whom AZA/6MP treatment induced adverse reactions.
The TPMT gene was found to have a wild-type sequence in all patients, but in the ITPA gene a mutation, 94C>A, was detected at a rate of 50% (8/16), with 83.3% (5/6) occurring in patients with acute bone marrow suppression and 75% (3/4) in those with agranulocytosis. The 94C>A allele frequency was 10 of 32 (0.313; 95% CI, 0.180-0.486). Adverse reactions developed earlier in patients with the 94C>A mutation. However, in half the patients, no gene polymorphism was noted.
It is suggested that the ITPA gene mutation is closely related to the adverse reactions of AZA/6-MP in Japanese patients, and screening for the mutant allele is useful for predicting the most serious adverse reactions, agranulocytosis and acute bone marrow suppression.
Guanethidine, acting on the rat isolated anococcygeus, causes adrenergic neurone blockade (slowly terminated by washing), noradrenaline potentiation and, with higher concentrations, spasm (both rapidly terminated by washing). 2 The spasm is an indirect sympathomimetic action, for it is sensitive to phentolamine and reserpine and shows tachyphylaxis. 3 The concentration of cocaine equieffective with the spasmogenic concentration of guanethidine as an inhibitor of noradrenaline uptake caused much less spasm. Moreover, it did not enhance noradrenaline efflux from anococcygeus loaded with (-)-[3H]-noradrenaline, as guanethidine did. 4 The spasm induced by guanethidine in excess of cocaine is due to guanethidine-evoked noradrenaline release.
Most renal cell carcinomas coexpress vimentin and keratin, while renal tubular epithelia express only keratin. Investigation of the intermediate filament composition of tubular epithelia in diseased rat and human kidneys now shows that altered tubular epithelia unequivocally coexpress keratin and vimentin. In rats, pronounced coexpression of vimentin and keratin was observed in chronic nephrosis induced by daunomycin, and the extent of coexpression seemed to increase with the incidence of altered collapsed and cystically dilated tubules and with the degree of tubular epithelial proliferation. It was also seen during tubular regeneration after acute tubulotoxic injury induced by mercury chloride poisoning, with vimentin expression being lost in fully regenerated tubular epithelium. In man, expression was seen in chronically and irreversibly damaged kidneys. Thus, vimentin can be expressed temporarily in acutely and reversibly damaged kidneys and chronically in irreversibly damaged kidneys. Vimentin could perhaps be regarded as an indicator of the regenerating and proliferating activity of tubular lesions.
Induction of Nrf2-mediated detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes is an effective strategy for cancer chemoprevention. The goal of this study was to examine the role of calcium [Ca(2+)] in regulating a well-known phenolic chemopreventive compound tertiary-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) activation of Nrf2 and induction of Nrf2 downstream target gene heme-oxygenase (HO-1). tBHQ alone caused Nrf2 nuclear localization and induced HO-1 mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. Using RT-PCR and Western blotting, we showed that tBHQ-induced transcription of HO-1 is Ca(2+)-dependent. Chelation of [Ca(2+)](ext) or [Ca(2+)](intra) by EGTA or BAPTA attenuated tBHQ-induced HO-1. Cotreatment of tBHQ with inhibitors of [Ca(2+)]-sensitive protein kinase C and camodulin kinase did not attenuate HO-1 induction. Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 induced by tBHQ was also not affected by treatment of EGTA or BAPTA. Additionally, EGTA and BAPTA treatments decreased basal nuclear phosphorylation of CREB and decreased tBHQ-induced Nrf2-CBP binding and Nrf2 binding to enhancer as well as polymerase II binding to the promoter of HO-1 gene. Furthermore, tBHQ in combination with higher [Ca(2+)](ext) augmented HO-1 induction both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the modulation of [Ca(2+)](int) could be used as an adjuvant to increase the efficacy of chemopreventive agents. Taken together, our results indicated that in addition to tBHQ-induced oxidative stress-mediated Nrf2 translocation, HO-1 induction by tBHQ also appears to be dependent on a series of Ca(2+)-regulated mechanisms.
We describe the production of an experimental model of parkinsonism induced by cinnarizine (CNZ) in three healthy sylvanna monkeys. The drug produced a severe but reversible parkinsonism in all animals. After discontinuation of CNZ, all animals recovered but the oldest one was akinetic for 6 weeks. CNZ produced a persistent reduction in HVA and 5-HIAA levels in the CSF. Our data suggest a predominant presynaptic effect on DA and 5-HT neurons; and could account for the longstanding parkinsonism induced by calcium antagonist in some patients as well as the depression observed in these subjects.
The modulation of cerebellar Purkinje cell activity and EEG from parietal cortex was studied in the rat model of epilepsy induced by penicillin under acute haloperidol and amphetamine treatment. The discharge pattern of Purkinje cells showed tendency towards inhibition and EEG power spectra increased after parenteral administration of penicillin (1000000 IU/kg, i.p.). Acute haloperidol treatment (1 mg/kg, i.p.), performed after the development of penicillin induced epileptic episodes, elicited a prominent excitation of Purkinje cell discharges associated with parallel increase in mean EEG power spectra. However, acute DL-amphetamine treatment induced marked suppression of Purkinje cell discharges as well as outstanding decrease of the mean EEG power spectra. These results indicate that cerebellar Purkinje cells may be important in the control of seizure activity and that noradrenergic influences are relevant.
This study was aimed to investigate the homeobox A9 (HOXA9) mRNA and protein expression in myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 and effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA 1 µmol/L) or arsenic trioxide (As2O3 1 µmol/L) on its expression, and to explore the pathogenesis of leukemia mediated by HOXA9 at mRNA and protein levels. The expression of HOXA9 mRNA and protein were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (FQ-RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. HL-60 cells were divided into 3 group: normal control added with RPMI 1640 medium, ATRA group and As2O3 group. The results indicated that HOXA9 mRNA expression in each group showed a firstly increasing and then decreasing tendency, in which the expression of HOXA9 mRNA was observed at day 1, increased at day 2, and decreased at day 3; while HOXA9 protein expression in each group was observed at day 1, the expression of HOXA9 protein in control group and ATRA group showed firstly increase and then decrease. The expression of HOXA9 protein in As2O3 group showed a decreased tendency gradually. The expression of HOXA9 mRNA in ATRA groups at day 1-3 was higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). The differences of HOXA9 mRNA expression between As2O3 groups and the control group were not significant at day 1 and day 3, but was higher than that in control group at day 2 (P < 0.05). The expression of HOXA9 protein in ATRA group at day 1- day 3 was higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). Compared with control group, the expression of HOXA9 protein in As2O3 group was higher at day 1 (P < 0.05), lower at day 2 (P < 0.05), and no significant differences at day 3. It is concluded that HOXA9 mRNA and protein express in HL-60 cells. ATRA 1 µmol/L can up-regulate the expression of HOXA9 mRNA and protein in HL-60 cells. The mechanisms of treatment of leukemia by ATRA and As2O3 may be associated with the regulation of the HOXA9 mRNA or protein expression.
We report the case of a 28-year-old man who was admitted in an emergency because of severe abdominal pain with gastrointestinal haemorrhage and shock. Laparotomy showed infarction of the small intestine with mesenteric veins thrombosis. Severe thromboembolic complications occurred during the post-operative period: bilateral femoral deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, axillary and subclavian vein thrombosis associated with an intravenous catheter, portal hypertension related to portal vein thrombosis and cavernoma, thrombosis of the superior longitudinal sinus. Laboratory investigations performed after thrombotic episodes and repeated 5 years later evidenced a type 1 Heparin Cofactor II deficiency (HCII Ag by EID: 40 percent; functional Tollefsen's method: 60 percent). This heterozygous deficiency was also found in one of the patient's sons. This is the first reported case of HCII deficiency associated with mesenteric infarction and cerebral thrombophlebitis. The relationship between these severe venous thrombotic episodes and the HCII deficiency is discussed in relation to the dermatan sulphate-HCII couple physiology. Vascular injury may act as a triggering factor in patients with HCII deficiency.
Nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in sinusoidal endothelial cells is reduced in the injured liver and leads to intrahepatic portal hypertension. The present study evaluates the effects of liposome-mediated gene transfer of eNOS on the intrahepatic vascular resistance and portal venous pressure (PVP) in cirrhotic rats.
Hepatic cirrhosis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)), whereas the control normal rats were given the same dose of peanut oil. Plasmid eukaryotic expression vector (liposome-pcDNA3/eNOS) was injected into the portal vein of CCl(4) cirrhotic rats, whereas cirrhotic controls received the same dose of naked plasmid (liposome-pcDNA3) or Tris buffer, and control normal rats received the same dose of Tris buffer. Five days after gene transfer, the levels of eNOS mRNA and protein, NO production, PVP and the changes of hepatic intrahepatic vascular resistance were investigated.
Five days after eNOS gene transfer, the levels of eNOS mRNA, eNOS protein and NO production in cirrhotic rats increased remarkably, while hepatic vascular resistance and PVP decreased significantly in cirrhotic rats.
Liposome-mediated eNOS gene transfer via intraportal injection is feasible and the increase of intrahepatic eNOS leads to a marked decrease in introhepatic vascular resistance and PVP. These data indicate that intrahepatic eNOS plays an important role in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension and gene transfer of eNOS is a potential and novel therapy for portal hypertension.
Transplantable tumors and cell lines have been developed from pheochromocytomas arising in mice with a heterozygous knockout mutation of the neurofibromatosis gene, Nf1. Nf1 encodes a ras-GTPase-activating protein, neurofibromin, and mouse pheochromocytoma (MPC) cells in primary cultures typically show extensive spontaneous neuronal differentiation that may result from the loss of the remaining wild-type allele and defective regulation of ras signaling. However, all MPC cell lines express neurofibromin, suggesting that preservation of the wild-type allele may be required to permit the propagation of MPC cells in vitro. MPC lines differ from PC12 cells in that they express both endogenous phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and full-length PNMT reporter constructs. PNMT expression is increased by dexamethasone and by cell-cell contact in suspension cultures. Mouse pheochromocytomas are a new tool for studying genes and signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation in adrenal medullary neoplasms and are a unique model for studying the regulation of PNMT expression.
The Rx homeobox gene is a transcriptional regulator indispensable for development of the eye and ventral forebrain. Rx-null homozygotes lack optic pits, which are the earliest ocular structures. To study the roles Rx may play at various stages of eye and brain development, we generated an allelic series at the Rx locus. The targeted allele, Rx(neo), is a severely hypomorphic or null allele. This Rx(neo) allele is converted via FLP-mediated recombination to the Rx(flox) allele, which is phenotypically identical to the wildtype allele. Cre-mediated conversion of Rx(flox) generates the RxDelta2 allele, which, when homozygous, results in an Rx-null phenotype that includes perinatal lethality, anophthalmia, and anterior neural and craniofacial defects. Mice carrying these alleles allow both Cre-mediated inactivation and FLP-mediated activation of Rx gene activity on a conditional basis and will be useful in examining Rx function at different developmental stages and in distinct tissue environments.
The aim of the study was to describe the use of the Brief Symptom Inventory in characterizing the type and severity of emotional distress in 26 patients with chronic hepatitis C who were receiving interferon-alpha-2B and ribavirin. The 6-month actuarial incidence of neuropsychiatric toxicity, determined by physician interview, was 58%. Significant differences in mean depression, anxiety, and somatization Brief Symptom Inventory T scores were noted in the 15 patients with clinically apparent neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to the 11 patients without neuropsychiatric toxicity. Because of its brevity and simplicity, the Brief Symptom Inventory may prove to be a useful adjunct to clinician assessment in detecting and monitoring emotional distress during interferon-alpha treatment of chronic hepatitis C.
Lung and colon tumors were induced in A/J, C3H, and A/J X C3H (AC3) mice by administering 16 mg/kg vinyl carbamate followed by 6 weekly doses of 12 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM). Beginning 1 week after carcinogen treatment, the mice received chemopreventive agents, dexamethasone or piroxicam, at 0.1 and 75 mg/kg in the diet, respectively. Both AOM and vinyl carbamate induces lung tumors, but only AOM induced colon tumors. The strain sensitivity for both colon and lung tumors was A/J > AC3 > C3H mice. Dexamethasone and piroxicam reduced the multiplicity of colon and lung tumors in A/J and AC3 mice, demonstrating the advantage of a combined colon and lung bioassay. The ability of budesonide, a drug that prevents mouse lung tumors, to modulate DNA methylation in vinyl carbamate-induced lung tumors was also determined. Budesonide administered for only 7 days prior to sacrifice caused a dose-dependent (0.6 to 2.4 mg/kg diet) reversal in tumors of DNA hypomethylation and hypomethylation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II gene in the differentially methylated region (DMR) 2 region of exons 4 to 5. Longer treatment with budesonide reversed hypomethylation when administered up to the time of sacrifice. These results indicate that reversal of the hypomethylation of DNA and of specific genes in lung tumors may be applicable as a surrogate end-point biomarker for chemoprevention.
A dozen studies have been published showing that opiate antagonists suppress alcohol drinking in animals, and two independent placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of naltrexone found this agent was associated with decreased alcohol craving and consumption in alcohol-dependent patients. Nalmefene is a newer opiate antagonist that has a number of potential advantages over naltrexone in the treatment of alcoholism, including no dose-dependent association with liver toxicity and more effective binding to central opiate receptors. Consequently, a double-blind pilot study was conducted to gather preliminary data on the safety and efficacy of nalmefene for reducing alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent subjects. Twenty-one alcohol-dependent subjects meeting admission criteria were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with 40 mg nalmefene, 10 mg nalmefene, or placebo, resulting in 7 patients/treatment group. Nalmefene was well tolerated, with no serious adverse drug reactions. The 40 mg group had a significantly lower rate of relapse (p < or = 0.05), and a greater increase in the number of abstinent days/week (p < or = 0.09), than the other treatment groups. A significant decrease in the number of drinks/drinking day was noted for both nalmefene groups (p < or = 0.04), but not for placebo. These results were supported by parallel decreases in ALT. These pilot data provide preliminary support for the hypotheses that nalmefene can be safely given to alcoholics, and that nalmefene may have a role in reducing alcohol consumption and preventing relapse, particularly at the 40 mg level. A full-scale study is underway to confirm these preliminary findings.
The effects of an ethanol extract of the aerial parts of Ruta chalepensis on the central nervous system (CNS) and LD(50) determination were studied in mice. A crude extract was given systemically and its effects were tested on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, sodium pentobarbital-induced hypnosis, exploratory activity, anxiety and nociception. Results from the experimental models tested showed: (1) a delay in the onset of seizures and a dose-dependent suppression in the tonic phase and mortality induced by PTZ; (2) a prolongation of the time of sodium pentobarbital-induced hypnosis; (3) a significant attenuation in the anxiety-response and (4) a reduction in the licking time and shaking behavior in the formalin-induced nociception test. The sedative-hypnotic potentiation, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and antinociceptive effects suggest that Ruta chalepensis induces a depressant activity on the CNS.
To evaluate the incidence of acute adverse reactions and degrees of heat sensation and local pain after intravenous injection of high and medium concentrations of iodinated contrast medium for computed tomography (CT).
A prospective study was performed involving 729 patients who underwent contrast CT scans. High-concentration (370 mgI/mL) and medium-concentration (300 mgI/mL) iodinated contrast medium was assigned to 342 patients (group H, aged 20-90 years, mean = 59.8 years) and to 387 patients (group M, aged 20-95 years, mean = 61.7 years), respectively. An injection rate of contrast medium (1, 2, or 4 mL/s) at a base volume of 2 mL/kg of body weight was selected according to the protocols for the evaluated diseases and regions. Each patient was assessed for heat sensation and local pain at the injection site using a visual analog scale (ranging from none for 0 to severe for 10). Acute adverse reactions were recorded when they occurred.
There were no significant differences in patient background factors, including age, sex, history of prior adverse reactions, and allergies, between the 2 groups. The score for heat sensation was significantly higher in group H than in group M (4.46 +/- 2.44 vs. 3.44 +/- 2.45; P < 0.0001 for heat sensation). The data did not show a higher incidence of adverse reactions in group H than in group M (5 [1.46%] of 342 patients vs. 2 [0.52%] of 387 patients; P = 0.26) or a higher score for local pain in group H than in group M (0.98 +/- 1.70 vs. 0.88 +/- 1.49; P = 0.66), respectively.
High and medium concentrations of iodinated contrast medium can be used for CT study with comparable safety profiles even though heat sensation produced by the high-concentration CM is greater than that produced by the medium-concentration CM.
The bronchodilatatory effect of inhaled dopamine or dopamine D(2) receptor agonists in cases of bronchial constriction may involve the suppression of pathologically increased airway sensory nerve activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the regulation of the dopamine D(2) receptor mRNA expression in the ganglia of rats with nitrogen dioxide-induced chronic bronchitis compared with that in ganglia of healthy control animals. Rats were exposed to nitrogen dioxide (10 ppm, 20 d) and dopamine D(2) receptor mRNA levels in sensory ganglia (jugular-nodose, trigeminal, cervical dorsal root and thoracic dorsal root ganglia) were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and compared to control tissues. Whereas for trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia the dopamine D(2) receptor expression levels showed no difference between both animal groups, there was a significant (p<0.05) increase in the jugular-nodose ganglia with a 2.1-fold factor. The increase of dopamine D(2) receptor mRNA in jugular-nodose sensory neurons which innervate the airways may represent a neurochemical basis for the effects seen in man and animal models following topical administration of dopamine or dopamine agonists onto the respiratory epithelium.
BACKGROUND: The role of copper accumulation in the onset of hepatitis is still unclear. Therefore, we investigated a spontaneous disease model of primary copper-toxicosis in Doberman pinschers so to gain insights into the pathophysiology of copper toxicosis, namely on genes involved in copper metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) defences. RESULTS: We used quantitative real-time PCR to determine differentially expressed genes within a target panel, investigating different groups ranging from copper-associated subclinical hepatitis (CASH) to a clinical chronic hepatitis with high hepatic copper concentrations (Doberman hepatitis, DH). Furthermore, a non-copper associated subclinical hepatitis group (N-CASH) with normal hepatic copper concentrations was added as a control. Most mRNA levels of proteins involved in copper binding, transport, and excretion were around control values in the N-CASH and CASH group. In contrast, many of these (including ATP7A, ATP7B, ceruloplasmin, and metallothionein) were significantly reduced in the DH group. Measurements on defences against oxidative stress showed a decrease in gene-expression of superoxide dismutase 1 and catalase in both groups with high copper. Moreover, the anti-oxidative glutathione molecule was clearly reduced in the DH group. CONCLUSION: In the DH group the expression of gene products involved in copper efflux was significantly reduced, which might explain the high hepatic copper levels in this disease. ROS defences were most likely impaired in the CASH and DH group. Overall, this study describes a new variant of primary copper toxicosis and could provide a molecular basis for equating future treatments in dog and in man.
Because of serious cardiovascular events, warnings against concomitant use of certain medications with the use of antihistamine (HismanalR have been published and added to product labeling. Quinine, the optical isomer to quinidine, is included in these warnings. We present the case of a patient with only mild electrolyte disturbances who experienced an episode of torsades de pointes after a single dose of quinine while taking astemizole.
Ferulic acid (FA), isolated from the root of Scrophularia buergeriana, is a phenolic compound possessing antioxidant, anticancer, and antiinflammatory activities. Here, we have investigated the hepatoprotective effect of FA against carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced acute liver injury. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with vehicle or FA (20, 40, and 80mg/kg) 1h before and 2h after CCl(4) (20μl/kg) injection. The serum activities of aminotransferases and the hepatic level of malondialdehyde were significantly higher after CCl(4) treatment, while the concentration of reduced glutathione was lower. These changes were attenuated by FA. The serum level and mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-α significantly increased after CCl(4) treatment, and FA attenuated these increases. The levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein and mRNA expression after CCl(4) treatment were significantly higher and FA reduced these increases. CCl(4)-treated mice showed increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and decreased levels of inhibitors of NF-κB in cytosol. Also, CCl(4) significantly increased the level of phosphorylated JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and nuclear translocation of activated c-Jun. FA significantly attenuated these changes. We also found that acute CCl(4) challenge induced TLR4, TLR2, and TLR9 protein and mRNA expression, and FA significantly inhibited TLR4 expression. These results suggest that FA protects from CCl(4)-induced acute liver injury through reduction of oxidative damage and inflammatory signaling pathways.
Postoperative pain after radical retropubic prostatectomy can be severe unless adequately treated. Low thoracic epidural analgesia and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia were compared in this double-blind, randomized study.
Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive either low thoracic epidural analgesia (group E) or patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (group P) for postoperative pain relief. All patients had general anesthesia combined with thoracic epidural analgesia during the operation. Postoperatively, patients in group E received an infusion of 1 mg/ml ropivacaine, 2 microg/ml fentanyl, and 2 microg/ml adrenaline, 10 ml/h during 48 h epidurally, and a placebo patient-controlled intravenous analgesia pump intravenously. Patients in group P received a patient-controlled intravenous analgesia pump with morphine intravenously and 10 ml/h placebo epidurally. Pain, the primary outcome variable, was measured using the numeric rating scale at rest (incision pain and "deep" visceral pain) and on coughing. Secondary outcome variables included gastrointestinal function, respiratory function, mobilization, and full recovery. Health-related quality of life was measured using the Short Form-36 questionnaire, and plasma concentration of fentanyl was measured in five patients to exclude a systemic effect of fentanyl.
Incisional pain and pain on coughing were lower in group E compared with group P at 2-24 h, as was deep pain between 3 and 24 h postoperatively (P < 0.05). Maximum expiratory pressure was greater in group E at 4 and 24 h (P < 0.05) compared with group P. No difference in time to home discharge was found between the groups. The mean plasma fentanyl concentration varied from 0.2 to 0.3 ng/ml during 0-48 h postoperatively. At 1 month, the scores on emotional role, physical functioning, and general health of the Short Form-36 were higher in group E compared with group P. However, no group x time interaction was found in the Short Form-36.
The authors found evidence for better pain relief and improved expiratory muscle function in patients receiving low thoracic epidural analgesia compared with patient-controlled analgesia for radical retropubic prostatectomy. Low thoracic epidural analgesia can be recommended as a good method for postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery.
Antiarrhythmic drugs administered intravenously run the risk of producing a hemodynamic collapse even when used by expert and well trained hands. The arrhythmias in the focal point of a preexcitation syndrome constitute a very special situation in which extreme caution must be used when using intravenous drugs, because the conduction through accessory channels can vary, depending on multiple factors. We describe a case of a patient with an accessory atrioventricular pathway and orthodromic tachycardia who developed cardiac arrest by wide QRS tachycardia after receiving intravenous amiodarone.
This study investigated the in vitro effects of the polyphenols resveratrol, mangiferin and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the histiophagous ciliate Philasterides dicentrarchi, which causes fatal scuticociliatosis in farmed turbot Scophthalmus maximus L. Of the 3 polyphenols, resveratrol showed strongest antiprotozoal activity, reducing ciliate density after 1 wk culture by, on average, 91% at 50 microM, and 96% at 500 microM. EGCG reduced ciliate density by, on average, 93% at 500 microM, with no significant effect at 50 microM. Mangiferin reduced ciliate density by, on average, 56% at 500 microM, again with no significant effect at 50 microM. In view of these findings, we discuss the potential utility of chemotherapy with polyphenols as a strategy for the control of scuticociliatosis in farmed turbot.
