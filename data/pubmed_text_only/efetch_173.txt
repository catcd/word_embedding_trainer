Sinus arrest is a rare complication of metoclopramide administration.
A 51-year-old woman developed Guillain-Barre syndrome and severe dysautonomia. Metoclopramide was administered for the treatment of gastroparesis. Sinus arrest followed drug administration on several occasions and on rechallenge.
After reviewing the literature and discussing possible etiologies for this unusual adverse drug reaction in this setting, we recommend that metoclopramide be used with caution in patients prone to develop bradyarrythmias, particularly those with dysautonomias and Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Mammary adenocarcinomas were induced by medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA) in female BALB/c mice. From 5 primary tumors, 9 different sublines were established by s.c. transplantation into syngeneic female mice; these developed after a long latent period (4-12 months). Each subline was transplanted both into 4 mice treated with 40mg of MPA depot (s.c. contralaterally to the tumor inoculum) and into 4 non-treated mice. Of the 9 sublines, 6 proved to be hormone-dependent (MPA-D) and 3 hormone-independent or autonomous (MPA-I). However, even the autonomous lines, when treated with MPA, showed a slight increase in growth. All MPA-D lines had a high content of ER (20-254 fmoles/mg of protein), PR (63-710), PRL-R (44-74) and low or non-detectable EGF-R. Of the 3 MPA-I sublines that were studied, 2 showed a high content of ER (16-125), PR (27-708), PRL-R (19-70) and EGF-R (29-65) while the other one had a low content of ER (0-36), PR (0-13), no EGF-R and moderate PRL-R (15-52). Spontaneous mammary tumors of BALB/c and C3H origin, which also showed an MPA-I pattern of tumor growth, had high levels of EGF-R. We postulate that MPA has a direct effect on mammary tumor cells in MPA-D lines and that the expression of EGF-R is correlated with an autonomous pattern of growth.
We tested the hypothesis that Niaspan (a prolonged release formulation of niacin) increases tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) expression and Notch signaling activity and promotes arteriogenesis after stroke. Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and were treated with or without Niaspan. Niaspan significantly elevated local cerebral blood flow, and increased arteriogenesis as indicated by increased arterial diameter and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation in the ischemic brain after stroke. The increased arteriogenesis significantly correlated with the functional outcome after stroke. Niaspan treatment of stroke upregulated TACE, Notch1, and Notch intracellular domain expression in the ischemic brain. To further investigate the mechanisms of Niaspan-induced arteriogenesis, a primary brain arterial culture was used. Niacin treatment significantly increased arterial sprouting and VSMC migration compared with control nontreated arterial cells. Inhibition of TACE by the TACE inhibitor or knockdown of TACE gene expression in brain arterial culture significantly attenuated Niacin-induced arterial sprouting and VSMC migration. In addition, TACE treatment of arterial culture significantly increased arterial VSMC migration and arterial sprouting. Knockdown of Notch1 marginally decreased arterial sprouting and VSMC migration compared with scrambled control. Niaspan promotes arteriogenesis, which is mediated, in part, by TACE.
Proteasome is an important target in cancer therapy. To enhance the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors is a challenging task due to the paucity of understanding the functional interactions between proteasome and other cellular pathways in mammalian cells. Taking advantage of the knowledge gained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that dyclonine and alverine citrate, the major components of two over-the-counter medicines, can substantially enhance the cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibitor MG132 on breast cancer cells. This study also highlights an important yeast genetic approach to identification of potential therapeutics that can be used for combination therapy with proteasome inhibitors.
Local danazol therapy reduces the signs and symptoms of endometriosis without inhibition of regular ovulation and menstruation and without atrophic changes to the endometrium or vaginal wall. It has been suggested that danazol has possible non-cytotoxic direct actions on eutopic endometrial cells and endometriotic cells. We have investigated the direct effects of danazol on a human endometrial epithelial cell line, HHUA, which is believed to retain many normal intracellular signaling pathways. A thoroughly dissolved solution of danazol enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis in HHUA cells without inhibiting cell proliferation. Semi-quantitative flow cytometric analysis revealed that danazol did not enhance cell surface expression of Fas antigens. The enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis by endometrial cytokines such as EGF, IL-1beta and interferon-gamma was not additively enhanced by danazol; nor did danazol enhance growth suppression by anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel, carboplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Moreover, danazol did not enhance the irradiation-induced cell growth suppression of radiation-sensitive human cervical squamous cancer ME180 cells. These results indicate that danazol may regulate endometrial epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis within normal physiology.
Both intermittent intravenous and intermittent oral calcitriol have been shown to be effective in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients and it has been claimed that intravenous calcitriol causes less hypercalcemia. However, there has been no published systematic comparison of the two routes of administration of intermittent calcitriol. Therefore in a prospective crossover study 11 (9 male) patients on maintenance hemodialysis were randomized to receive intravenous followed by oral calcitriol for 4 months each, or oral followed by intravenous calcitriol, commencing at 2 micrograms postdialysis three times per week. Initial serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (PTH) was 446 +/- 111 (normal < 65) pg/ml. Calcium-containing phosphate binders were not used. Calcitriol was ceased if hypercalcemia developed and restarted at 2 micrograms or 1 microgram when calcium returned to normal. Hypercalcemia was frequent (11 episodes in 8 patients on intravenous calcitriol and 10 episodes in 7 patients on oral calcitriol) and dose reduction to 1 microgram was necessary in 7 patients on intravenous and on 6 patients on oral. Serum PTH fell during both treatments. Parathyroid enlargement was seen in 10 glands from 4 patients, but no size reduction was demonstrated with treatment. There was no reduction in activity on quantitative metabolic bone scan. In summary, intermittent oral calcitriol and intermittent intravenous calcitriol were equally effective in reducing serum parathyroid hormone levels and at a dose of 2 micrograms postdialysis caused hypercalcemia with equal frequency.
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous disease. Endocapillary proliferation is associated with higher risk of progressive disease, and clinical studies suggest that corticosteroids mitigate this risk. However, corticosteroids are associated with protean cellular effects and significant toxicity. Furthermore the precise mechanism by which they modulate kidney injury in IgAN is not well delineated. To better understand molecular pathways involved in the development of endocapillary proliferation and to identify novel specific therapeutic targets, we evaluated the glomerular transcriptome of microdissected kidney biopsies from 22 patients with IgAN. Endocapillary proliferation was defined according to the Oxford scoring system independently by 3 nephropathologists. We analyzed mRNA expression using microarrays and identified transcripts differentially expressed in patients with endocapillary proliferation compared to IgAN without endocapillary lesions. Next, we employed both transcription factor analysis and in silico drug screening and confirmed that the endocapillary proliferation transcriptome is significantly enriched with pathways that can be impacted by corticosteroids. With this approach we also identified novel therapeutic targets and bioactive small molecules that may be considered for therapeutic trials for the treatment of IgAN, including resveratrol and hydroquinine. In summary, we have defined the distinct molecular profile of a pathologic phenotype associated with progressive renal insufficiency in IgAN. Exploration of the pathways associated with endocapillary proliferation confirms a molecular basis for the clinical effectiveness of corticosteroids in this subgroup of IgAN, and elucidates new therapeutic strategies for IgAN.
No systematic study has been performed to evaluate the effect of cisapride on the QT interval in premature infants. Cisapride, which has recently been withdrawn by the Food and Drug Administration and is no longer an approved therapy, was commonly used for preterm infant care to improve the advance of enteral feedings and to reduce reflux and associated apnea. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of recommended doses of cisapride on the QT interval in this population.
Prospective blinded evaluation of electrocardiogram for QT, JT, QTc, and JTc measurements in 25 preterm infants before and after cisapride administration.
Twelve of 25 infants (48%) developed repolarization abnormalities with cisapride administration: 32% of the infants (8/25) studied had QTc prolongation (>/=0.450 seconds), whereas 10/25 had JTc prolongation (>/=0.360 seconds). Preterm infants <32 weeks significantly prolonged their QTc interval from 0.41 +/- 0.02 to 0.44 +/- 0.02. The QTc and/or JTc was prolonged in 54% of infants receiving 0.1 mg/kg/dose and 42% receiving 0.2 mg/kg/dose.
The QTc and JTc interval significantly prolonged in preterm infants <32 weeks on the recommended dose of cisapride therapy. A QTc >/=0.450 seconds developed in 32% of infants treated with cisapride, whereas the JTc prolonged in 40%. A significant percentage of infants (54%) developed prolonged QTc intervals at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/dose. From these data we conclude that there is a higher risk of prolongation of the QTc interval and risk of arrhythmias with greater prematurity.
To investigate color vision in epilepsy patients treated with vigabatrin or carbamazepine monotherapy and to evaluate the association between vigabatrin-induced visual field defects and dyschromatopsia.
Nonrandomized comparative trial.
Thirty-two epilepsy patients treated with vigabatrin monotherapy, 18 patients treated with carbamazepine monotherapy, and 47 age-matched healthy controls were examined.
Color vision was examined with Standard Pseudoisochromatic Plates 2 (SPP2) screening test, Farnsworth-Munsell 100 (FM 100) hue test, and Color Vision Meter 712 anomaloscope.
Abnormal color perception was found in 32% of the epilepsy patients treated with vigabatrin monotherapy and 28% of the epilepsy patients treated with carbamazepine monotherapy. The total error score in the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test was abnormally high in the vigabatrin monotherapy patients who had concentrically constricted visual fields and a statistically significant correlation was found between the temporal visual field extents and the age-adjusted Farnsworth-Munsell 100 total error score in vigabatrin monotherapy patients (R = .533, P = 0.003 in the right eye, R = .563, P = 0.001 in the left eye). Four of 31 (12%) vigabatrin monotherapy patients, and 1 of 18 (6%) carbamazepine monotherapy patients had a blue axis in Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test. In the anomaloscope, there were a few pathologic findings in both groups. In the SPP2 screening test, a few plates were not seen in both groups.
Both examined antiepileptic drugs, vigabatrin and carbamazepine, cause acquired color vision defects. The abnormal color perception seems to be associated with constricted visual fields in the vigabatrin monotherapy patients. The duration of carbamazepine therapy correlates with high FM100 total error score. The best method for detecting dyschromatopsia in patients treated with vigabatrin or carbamazepine was the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test. The SPP2 screening test does not seem to be useful in clinical practice.
CITED2 is a transcriptional modulator which has been implicated in human oncogenesis. In the present study, we examined whether CITED2 is also involved in the resistance of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. We first observed that knockdown of CITED2 using short-hairpin RNA sensitized non-tumorigenic HEK293 cells to cisplatin. Sensitization to cisplatin following knockdown of CITED2 was also observed in cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and in cisplatin-resistant HeLa cells, thereby showing that acquired cisplatin resistance could be reversed by CITED2 knockdown. This sensitization response was dependent on the status of p53 since efficient sensitization was observed in p53-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Sk-Hep-1 cells, whereas a negligible response was produced in the two p53-defective cell lines HCC Mahlavu and lung cancer H1299. In contrast, overexpression of CITED2 decreased sensitivity of HEK293 cells to cisplatin, while moderate resistance was produced in HeLa cells. Overexpression of CITED2 also decreased sensitivity to cisplatin in p53-defective H1299 cells when exogenous p53 expression was re-introduced. We observed that knockdown of CITED2-induced CBP/p300-mediated p53 acetylation (Lys373) in HEK293 cells, thereby leading to a decrease of p53 ubiquitination and subsequent accumulation of the p53 protein. Notably, the effects of CITED2 knockdown on p53 accumulation and the increase of p53's target Bax were more pronounced after treatment with cisplatin. Based on these results, we propose that a combination of cisplatin and CITED2 shRNA may represent an effective treatment against p53-sensitive cancer cells.
An analysis was made of 539 cases of venous flare reactions associated with the administration of doxorubicin. These reactions always were nondebilitating and generally were transient with complete resolution occurring within 45 minutes of onset in 462 patients (86%). Local urticaria occurred in 133 patients (25%), and 35 patients (6%) reported either vein pain or a stinging sensation. In 20 cases (4%), erythema in the region immediately surrounding the infusion site accompanied the primary manifestation of erythema along the course of the vein proximal to the infusion site. The incidence of initial flare reactions peaked in the autumn months. These reactions frequently occurred at clinical sites in sporadic clusters. Clinical features are described that differentiate flare reactions from early extravasations of doxorubicin. Procedures for minimizing the possibility of the occurrence or reappearance of flare reactions are suggested.
To investigate mechanisms of chemical-induced congenital heart defects (CHD) we have developed a rat model using dimethadione (DMO), the N-demethylated metabolite of the anticonvulsant, trimethadione (TMD). Dosing pregnant rats with 300mg/kg DMO every 12h from the evening of gestational day (GD) 8 until the morning of GD 11 (six total doses) produces a mean 74% incidence of CHD with inter litter variability ranging from 40 to 100%. The goal of this study was to determine if the variability in maternal serum concentrations of DMO on GD 14, a surrogate marker for total exposure, was related to the inter-litter differences in teratogenic outcomes. To test this hypothesis, pregnant rats were dosed as described above and serum levels of DMO assessed on GD 14. On GD 21, foetuses were collected by caesarean section, assessed for a number endpoints and the outcomes were correlated with the GD 14 serum concentrations of DMO. DMO exposure was associated with decreased foetal body weight, increased incidence of sternal defects and CHD, but these endpoints were not meaningfully correlated with maternal concentrations of DMO. Novel findings were decreased viability as measured one-hour following caesarean section, and delayed alveolar maturation. The major conclusions from these studies were first, that serum DMO concentrations on GD 14 did not predict teratogenicity, and second, delayed lung development may contribute to the decreased survival of foetuses at the time of caesarean section.
A retrospective analysis was conducted to compare the tolerability and efficacy of single-agent capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in the first-line treatment of patients aged > or =65 years with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
Consecutive patients with mCRC treated at the Military Medical Institute, Warsaw, between January 2003 and June 2008 were eligible. A total of 123 patients were identified (FOLFIRI, n = 67; capecitabine, n = 56).
The overall response rate with FOLFIRI was 28.1 versus 16.4% with capecitabine (P = 0.1398). Median time to disease progression with FOLFIRI was 8.8 versus 7.5 months with capecitabine (P = 0.20), and median overall survival was 19.0 versus 15.4 months (P = 0.93). In the FOLFIRI group, neutropenia and anaemia were significantly more frequent than in the capecitabine group. The main non-haematological toxicity was hand-foot syndrome found only in the capecitabine group.
Single-agent capecitabine and FOLFIRI are effective first-line regimens in patients aged > or =65 years with mCRC.
These experiments examined the potential for single or repeated doses of aspartame to exacerbate or facilitate the production of seizures in Fischer-344 rats. In adult animals, 1,000 mg/kg of aspartame given by gavage acutely or over a 14 day period had no significant effect on the rate of kindling induced by stimulation of the prepyriform cortex. A single dose of 1,000 mg/kg of aspartame had no effect on the number of animals developing tonic seizures after electroconvulsive shock, nor did aspartame affect the frequency or duration of seizure activity after pentylenetetrazol. In a second series of studies, young male and female rats were dosed with 1,000 mg/kg of aspartame on day 3-13 or 21-35 of age. Prior exposure to aspartame had no significant effect on the rate of kindling at 90 days of age. These experiments indicate that aspartame does not act a pro-convulsant in rats.
Twenty-five patients with a variety of histologic types of advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma refractory to previous chemotherapy were entered into a trial of vincristine infusion. Patients received 5-day courses of vincristine 0.25 mg/m2/day by continuous intravenous infusion after an initial 0.5 mg intravenous bolus injection. Courses were repeated every 3 weeks. Objective responses were observed in nine patients (36%), all of whom had previously received vincristine given by conventional bolus injection. A complete response occurred in a patient with diffuse mixed histiocytic lymphocytic lymphoma, and partial responses were observed in eight patients with the following histologic types: diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic (4); nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic (2); diffuse mixed histiocytic lymphocytic (1); and diffuse histiocytic (1). Duration of response lasted from 1.2 to 16.2 months (mean, 4.4 months). The principal complication of therapy was mild-to-moderate neurotoxicity; this occurred in 12 patients (48%) who received a total of 54 courses of vincristine infusion. Hematologic toxicity was minimal and nausea/vomiting did not occur. Vincristine infusion may afford palliation for patients with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphomas who have become refractory to standard chemotherapeutic regimens even if they have received prior vincristine by conventional bolus injection. These data suggest the possibility of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of vincristine in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by use of an infusion technique.
The therapeutic effect of hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) plus 514.5-nm argon ion laser radiation was compared to HpD plus 630-nm argon ion laser-pumped dye laser radiation in experimental urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma models. Cultured human bladder cancer cells (EJ) containing HpD were 2.8-fold more sensitive to 514.5-nm radiation than to 630-nm radiation as measured by clonogenic capacity. The relative effectiveness of 514.5-nm versus 630-nm light was approximately proportional to the spectral absorbance for cell-bound HpD at these wavelengths. HpD-sensitized photoirradiation was studied in solid tumors produced by a) the subcutaneous inoculation of cells from murine bladder tumors induced by N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazoyl]formamide (CAS: 24554-26-5) into female C3H mice (MBT-2 tumor) and b) the intravesical instillation of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (CAS: 684-93-5) into the urinary bladders of female Wistar rats. The tumors were exposed to 144 J/cm2 laser light 24-48 hours following ip injection of 20 mg HpD/kg body weight. By 24-48 hours, animals that received HpD and light of either wavelength had partially or completely necrosed tumors. Control groups showed no necrotic changes. Regression of MBT-2 tumors was also investigated. Seven of 14 and 6 of 12 animals had nonpalpable tumors 1 week after treatment with 514.5-nm and 630-nm light, respectively. Tumors in control groups demonstrated no regression. Spectral transmittance from 630 nm to 514.5 nm decreased by about 4% for 130- to 160-micron-thick sections of canine urothelium and bladder submucosa-muscularis. The results of this study indicate that HpD plus 514.5-nm laser radiation may be an effective treatment for small or superficial malignant lesions of the urinary bladder.
The copper-binding cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and the heparan sulphate (HS)-containing proteoglycan glypican-1 (Gpc-1) can both be attached to lipid rafts via their glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, and copper ions stimulate their cointernalization from the cell surface to endosomes. The prion protein controls cointernalization and delivers copper necessary for S-nitrosylation of conserved cysteines in the Gpc-1 core protein. Later, during recycling through endosomal compartments, nitric oxide can be released from the S-nitroso groups and catalyses deaminative degradation and release of the HS substituents. Here, by using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that normal PrP(C) and Gpc-1 colocalize inside GT1-1 cells. However, in scrapie-infected cells (ScGT1-1), Gpc-1 protein remained at the cell surface separate from the cellular prion protein. Scrapie infection stimulated Gpc-1 autoprocessing and the generated HS degradation products colocalized with intracellular aggregates of the disease-related scrapie prion protein isoform (PrP(Sc)). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Gpc-1 and PrP(C) in uninfected cells, and between HS degradation products and PrP(Sc) in infected cells. Silencing of Gpc-1 expression or prevention of Gpc-1 autoprocessing elevated the levels of intracellular PrP(Sc) aggregates in infected cells. These results suggest a role for Gpc-1 autoprocessing in the clearance of PrP(Sc) from infected cells.
We analyzed the excretion of the three urinary enzymes, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), alanine aminopeptidase (AAP), and glycyl-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (GP-DAP) and the three urinary proteins, beta-microglobulin (beta 2-M), alpha-microglobulin (alpha 1-M), and albumin during the intravenous administration of anti cancer drugs in 4 prostatic cancer patients and 16 urothelial cancer patients. The patients with prostatic cancer were treated with VIP (vincristine, ifosfamide, peplomycin) chemotherapy and the patients with urothelial cancer were treated with MP (methotrexate, cisplatinum) or MEP (methotrexate, Etoposide, cisplatinum) combination chemotherapy. beta 2-M was the best parameter for drug-induced renal damage because of its sharp and large reactivities. Any urinary enzyme or protein especially albumin which had showed a markedly high value before the chemotherapy was not suitable as a urinary drug-induced renal damage parameter. There was a close resemblance in reactivity pattern between GP-DAP and AAP probably because of the same localization of these enzymes in the renal tubular bruch borders. In the patients with renal damage by chemotherapy, all parameters were changed showing two peaks or persisted with high values.
Dysregulation of dopamine receptors is thought to underlie levodopa-induced dyskinesias in experimental models of Parkinson's disease. It is unknown whether an imbalance of the second messengers, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), is involved in the alterations of levodopa/dopamine signal transduction. We examined cAMP and cGMP signalling in the interconnected cortico-striatal-pallidal loop at the peak of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the substantia nigra. In addition, we examined the role of phosphodiesterase (PDE) and the rate of cAMP and cGMP degradation on the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in animals pretreated with PDE inhibitor, zaprinast. Unilateral lesion of substantia nigra led to an increase in cAMP but a decrease in cGMP levels in the ipsilateral basal ganglia. After chronic levodopa treatment, cAMP and cGMP were differentially regulated in eukinetic animals: the cAMP level increased in the cortex and striatum but decreased in the globus pallidus of both hemispheres, whereas the cGMP decreased below baseline levels in the contralateral cortico-striatal-pallidal regions. In dyskinetic animals chronic levodopa treatment led to an absolute decrease in cAMP and cGMP levels in cortico-striatal-pallidal regions of both hemispheres. Pretreatment with zaprinast reduced the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesias, and partly prevented the decrease in cyclic nucleotides compared with pretreatment with saline-levodopa. In conclusion, using a rat model of hemiparkinsonism, we observed a significant reduction in the levels of cyclic nucleotides in both hemispheres at the peak of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. We propose that such a decrease in cyclic nucleotides may partly result from increased catabolism through PDE overactivity.
The effects of morphine and captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on respiratory frequency have been investigated in non-anesthetized mice. Morphine (10.0 mg/kg) reduced the respiratory frequency which gradually returned to the control level 2 h after the injection. The same dose of morphine when given together with captopril (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg), caused a similar reduction in respiratory rate. This respiratory depression however, persisted until the end of the observation period. Similar results were obtained with the same dose of morphine in mice pretreated with captopril. The minimal dose of morphine reducing respiratory frequency (3.0 mg/kg), when given to the mice pretreated with captopril (0.1 mg/kg) caused a significant reduction in respiratory frequency and this effect was equal to that obtained with 10.0 mg/kg morphine alone. The results are discussed from the point of the possible inhibitory effect of captopril on the enkephalin degrading enzyme(s).
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) carries a dismal prognosis in older patients. In this study, the authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of arsenic trioxide combined with low-dose cytarabine in untreated patients aged >or=60 years with AML.
In a phase 1/2 design, arsenic trioxide was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg on Days 1 through 5 and on Days 8 through 12, and low-dose cytarabine was given subcutaneously twice daily on Days 1 through 14 in escalating doses to a target of 10 mg/m(2) per dose. Of 64 patients who had pathologically confirmed AML, excluding patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and using World Health Organization criteria, the median age was 71 years, 10 patients (16%) had treatment-related AML, 40 patients (63%) had an antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disorder, and 35 patients (55%) had unfavorable cytogenetics. Thirty-four patients (53%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or 3.
Complete remission was achieved in 21 of 61 patients (34%), including 15 of 50 patients (30%) who had secondary or treatment-related AML, 10 of 33 patients (30%) who had unfavorable cytogenetics, and 6 of 34 patients (18%) who had a poor baseline performance status. The mortality rate within the first 4 weeks was 8%. Neutropenic fever was observed in >80% of patients, and 41% of patients had bacteremia. Nonhematologic toxicity generally was mild and reversible and included fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, rash, peripheral edema, and elevated transaminases. There were no clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias.
The addition of arsenic trioxide to low-dose cytarabine appeared to improve responses in elderly patients who had AML compared with either agent alone, and a randomized trial of the combination versus single-agent low-dose cytarabine is ongoing.
The authors describe a case of type 4 renal tubular acidosis, observed in a subject with liver cirrhosis, the pathogenetic cause of which was probably the assumption of spironolactone. It is thought that, even if such an eventuality is not very frequent, it must be considered in clinical practice, in view of the negative consequences that the reduction in urinary ammonium excretion and hyponatriemia, together with this particular form of acidosis, may have on the neurological state of the patients.
Caudal regression syndrome (CRS) comprises developmental anomalies of the caudal vertebrae, neural tube, urogenital and digestive organs, and hind limbs, the precursors of all of which are derived from the caudal eminence. Although the syndrome is well recognized, the etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms are poorly understood. Genetic and experimental models may provide some important clues to the early events that precede the dysmorphogenesis in CRS. The objectives of this study were to determine the susceptible stages for induction of CRS and to ascertain the early events that precede the development of this syndrome in a mouse model. Single oral doses of 100, 150, or 200 mg/kg retinoic acid (RA) were administered to TO mice on one of Gestation Days (GD) 8 to 12, and fetuses were observed on GD 18. All doses administered on GD 8 or 9 resulted in CRS in a large number of survivors. Agenesis of the tail, caudal vertebral defects, spina bifida occulta/aperta, imperforate anus, rectovesicle or rectourethral fistula, renal malformations, cryptorchidism, gastroschisis, and limb malformations, including the classical mermaid syndrome (sirenomelia), were characteristic features of this animal model. Several craniofacial malformations accompanied CRS in the GD 8 treatment group. Chronologic examination of treated embryos at early stages revealed pronounced cell death in the caudal median axis, hindgut, and neural tube and consequently, failure of development of the tail bud in the high-dose groups. In the 100 mg/kg RA group, patches of hemorrhage occurred initially that subsequently coalesced into large hematomas and the tail progressively regressed. Histologic examination revealed the onset and progression of hemorrhage, edema, and cell death in these embryos. Transillumination and histologic preparations also revealed dilation of the caudal neural tube in the prospective CRS embryos. Thus, a combination of cell death, vascular disruption, and tissue deficiency appears to be the highlight of caudal regression in this model. Symmelia appeared to be due to failure of fission or due to the merger of limb fields rather than a result of fusion of two limb buds. The data are also indicative of caudal agenesis in the high-dose RA groups and caudal regression due to a combination of vascular disruption, edema, and cell death in the lower dose groups of TO mouse embryos.
Systemic administration of morphine hydrochloride (MF; 5-80 mg/kg; i.p.) in rats enhanced the epileptogenic potential of pilocarpine hydrochloride (PIL) in a dose-dependent manner. PIL, 100 mg/kg; i.p., which did not result in convulsions by itself, produced sustained limbic seizures and epileptic brain damage in MF-pretreated rats. MF-induced enhancement of PIL neurotoxicity was blocked by naloxone hydrochloride (NAL; 2 and 10 mg/kg; i.p.). Administration of NAL (2-20 mg/kg) prior to PIL in the dose of 380 mg/kg moderately decreased the incidence of convulsions, brain damage and lethal toxicity produced by this agent. These results support the hypothesis that opiate mechanisms are involved in the maintenance of the threshold for propagation of seizure activity within limbic circuits.
