To determine the possible involvement of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the development of airway hyper responsiveness (AHR).
Twenty-five rabbits were randomly divided into five groups (5 animals each). Four groups were exposed to 2.0 ppm ozone 1 h/day for 1 (group B(0)), 2 (group B(1)), 4 (group B(2)), and 8 (group B(3)) days, respectively. The control group (group A) breathed only filtered room air. The changes of the VIP level and the mRNA expression of VIP receptor 1 (VIPR1) in the lung were detected at various ozone-stressing time points. In situ hybridization was performed to examine the distribution of VIPR1 in the lung.
(1) The concentration of VIP in the lung increased slowly and were maximal at day 4, then returned to the normal level. (2) The changing pattern of the VIPR1 mRNA in the lung was similar to those observed for VIP. Increases in VIPR1 mRNA were detectable by 1 day and maximal by 2 - 4 days, and then decreased slowly. (3) In group A, VIPR1 was expressed on airway epithelium, in pulmonary interstitial and focal areas of airways and vascular smooth muscles. By days 2 to 4, hybridization staining increased and the majority of VIPR1-positive cells was located in the perivascular and peribronchiolar area. On day 8, very few positive cells were seen in the lung.
VIP may play an important role in the development of AHR by binding with VIPR1.
We recently demonstrated that benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) causes cardiac hypertrophy by altering arachidonic acid metabolism through the induction of the expression of CYP ω-hydroxylases and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzymes. The inhibition of CYP ω-hydroxylase enzymes partially reversed the BaP-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, it is important to examine whether the inhibition of sEH also confers cardioprotection. For this purpose, male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally daily with either the sEH inhibitor 1-(1-methanesulfonyl-piperidin-4-yl)-3-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-urea (TUPS; 0.65 mg/kg), BaP (20 mg/kg), or the combination of BaP (20 mg/kg) and TUPS (0.65 mg/kg) for 7 days. Thereafter, the heart, liver, and kidney were harvested, and the heart to body weight ratio was measured. The expression of the hypertrophic markers, sEH, heme oxygenase-1, and CYP450 enzymes was determined. Our results demonstrate that BaP alone significantly induced the expression of sEH and CYP ω-hydroxylases in the heart, liver, and kidney tissues. Treatment with TUPS significantly reversed the BaP-mediated induction of the hypertrophic markers, completely prevented the increase in the heart to body weight ratio, and reduced the BaP-induced CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP4F4, and CYP4F5 genes in the heart. The current study demonstrates the cardioprotective effect of sEH inhibitor, TUPS, against BaP-induced cardiac hypertrophy and further confirms the role of sEH and CYP450 enzymes in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.
1. The patient, a 59 year old woman, developed a state of acute excitation several hours after the administration of 400 mg of the fluorquinolone pefloxacin in combination with 1000 mg paracetamol. Nine days later, after a total dosage of pefloxacin of 800 mg, she was admitted to our hospital with a psychotic disorder. 2. There was a full remission of symptoms after treatment with perazine up to a dosage of 500 mg/day. 3. Three years ago, the patient had developed a manic state under a medication with corticosteroids. 4. So far, the mechanism of--in this case--long-lasting central nervous side effects of fluorquinolones is not known. In patients with increased vulnerability of the CNS or in advanced age the application of fluorquinolones should be considered critically, in particular in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Granisetron (BRL 43694A) is a novel, selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist developed for the prophylaxis and treatment of cytostatic drug-induced emesis. After a brief review of the preclinical evaluation of granisetron the clinical findings with this novel compound are summarised. From the data of large randomised trials one can conclude that granisetron is an active antiemetic, both as a prophylactic and an intervention agent, to an extent which is superior or at least equal to the best available antiemetic combination regimens, having a major efficacy ranging from 74 to 92%. Granisetron may be given as a single, 5-min infusion before chemotherapy and is thus more convenient to administer than many antiemetic regimens. The adverse event profile of granisetron is favourable with a wide therapeutic margin. The only consistent side-effects attributable to granisetron are headache in about 14% of the patients and constipation in about 4% of the patients. Headache induced by granisetron was generally mild and resolved spontaneously or was promptly relieved with standard analgesics. No extrapyramidal side-effects were observed with granisetron.
Since the early 1990s, mitoxantrone has been used as a chemotherapeutic agent for adjuvant intravesical treatment following transurethral resection of superficial transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder. Although its efficacy as adjuvant intravesical therapy remains questionable and its use has not gained wide acceptance, the safety profile of the drug has been reported as favorable. We report the first case of mitoxantrone-induced severe bladder contracture leading to a completely nonfunctional bladder after intravesical administration of the drug. Cystectomy and urinary diversion were the final consequences for the patient.
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a rare complication of solid organ transplantation. Immunosuppressive drugs, including cyclosporin A and tacrolimus, have frequently been incriminated. Here we report a case of tacrolimus-induced HUS in a woman with small-for-size syndrome after living-donor liver transplantation. Hypertension, microangiopathic anaemia and end-stage renal failure occurred in the immediate post-transplant period; all other risk factors that might be implicated in the development of HUS were investigated and excluded if no evidence was found. A possible association between small-for-size syndrome, which frequently results in a high blood concentration of tacrolimus post-operatively, and the occurrence of HUS is discussed.
Combination lipid-reducing therapy is increasingly used, particularly for the management of severe or combined dyslipidemia in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease. To assess the potential additive effects of combining the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe with a bile acid resin (BAR), a prospective chart review was performed of 40 patients in whom ezetimibe 10 mg/day was added to a stable regimen that included a BAR. At an average follow-up of 107 +/- 57 days, ezetimibe coadministration significantly reduced total cholesterol by 18%, triglycerides by 14%, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 19% (all p < or =0.03), without significantly changing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the combination was well tolerated.
Twenty-four healthy male subjects participated in a study comparing plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin generated by single applications of Nitradisc 32 mg, Transiderm-Nitro 50 mg and Nitro-Dur 104 mg patches and from one inch of Nitrobid 2% ointment. The three patch preparations are designed to release 10 mg nitroglycerin systemically over a 24 h period. Nitrobid ointment is intended to deliver 15 mg nitroglycerin per inch of ointment, and to be reapplied at least every 8 h. Blood was taken for nitroglycerin assay up to and including 24 h after each application. Assay for nitroglycerin was performed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique. Plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin were sustained up to the 24 h mark with all three patch preparations, but not with application of Nitrobid ointment. Nitrobid was associated with a rapid rise in nitroglycerin plasma concentrations maximal 1 h after application. Plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin absorbed from Nitrobid ointment fell below those absorbed from all three patch preparations after 8 h. Clinically, all four formulations were similar with respect to side effects, with headache and dizziness being the most common.
A case of capecitabine-associated cerebellar ataxia is presented.
A 65-year-old white woman with stage IV colorectal cancer with liver metastasis was started on a chemotherapy regimen of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab, given every three weeks. She tolerated the first two treatment cycles fairly well without major toxicities. The capecitabine dosage was started at 2000 mg daily for 14 days during the first cycle and increased to 2500 and 3000 mg daily during the second and the third cycles, respectively. On day 5 of the third cycle, the patient reported increased nausea, fatigue, and sleepiness, and the dosage of capecitabine was subsequently reduced to 2500 mg daily. On day 12 of the fourth treatment cycle, she reported ongoing lightheadedness and progressive gait disturbance with worsening ataxia over the past 3 days. Her capecitabine dosage was further reduced to 2000 mg daily, and the time between treatment intervals was increased to four weeks. The patient continued to experience intermittent, but less severe, ataxia during the fifth treatment cycle. On the day before the seventh cycle was to begin, she had ataxic gait and could not walk without assistance. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no evidence of brain metastasis or cerebellar abnormality. The chemotherapy was postponed for a total of six weeks until the ataxia completely resolved. Her chemotherapy was ultimately discontinued due to disease progression. Her neurologic symptoms did not recur.
A patient receiving capecitabine-containing chemotherapy developed persistent but reversible cerebellar ataxia.
We report here a child developing hypomania while treated with clarithromycin.
Case report.
A 3-year-old boy was treated for pneumonia with oral clarithromycin in monotherapy. The boy became somewhat hyperactive and irritable after the second dose. After the third dose he presented with psychomotor agitation, pressured speech, irritability, aggressive behaviour and insomnia. The antibiotic was identified as the only possible cause of the described clinical picture and was discontinued immediately. The hypomanic symptoms subsided gradually over 36 h.
Commonly-used medications can produce uncommon adverse reactions. Clinicians, especially general practitioners, pediatricians, as well as child and adolescent psychiatrists ought to be aware of such a possibility when evaluating a child with suddenly changed behaviour.
In 14 patients with hypertensive crisis treated with diazoxide, close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms was performed. Standard 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded before and after diazoxide. All patients showed a significant fall in blood pressure after drug administration. Seven patients (50%) showed significant ST-T changes after diazoxide. Six patients (43%) developed substernal discomfort demonstrated by substernal pain of tightness. Five patients (35%) had both chest discomfort and ST-T changes. One of these patients with substernal pain and ST elevation had evidence of acute myocardial infarction with serial enzyme studies. In the patients with significant ST-T changes, the average fall in blood pressure was significantly greater than the average fall in blood pressure in the patients without significant ST-T changes. These findings suggest that both ST-T changes and substernal discomfort were due to myocardial ischemia secondary to a sudden severe drop in blood pressure.
Cocaine abuse has recently emerged as a major problem among young adults, and is increasingly associated with a variety of medical complications. In view of recent reports demonstrating that illicit cocaine use may cause rhabdomyolysis, we reviewed the collective experience of a university-affiliated medical center to identify patients with cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis.
Among hospital admissions due to acute cocaine abuse during the period June 1987 through June 1988, we identified seven patients who exhibited biochemical evidence of skeletal muscle injury. Six of these patients presented within one hour of free-basing cocaine with complaints of thoracic skeletal muscle pain. Hospital admission was prompted by the suspicion of myocardial ischemia or infarction. The remaining patient was incidentally found to have an elevated serum level of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) after abusing cocaine and was hospitalized to exclude a cardiac origin.
Serum CPK levels in the seven patients rose to a mean peak value of 16.1 +/- 3.6 mu kat/L, and returned toward normal within 72 hours. A cardiac origin for the elevated CPK values was excluded by negative results of determinations of CPK-MB fractions.
Rhabdomyolysis must be added to the every-growing list of medical complications associated with the illicit use of cocaine. Skeletal muscle injury may be a more common complication of cocaine abuse than has previously been appreciated, escaping medical attention when the clinical manifestations are relatively mild. The importance of recognizing this clinical entity lies in the potential confusion with myocardial ischemia. This point is illustrated by the fact that each of our patients was hospitalized to exclude the possibility of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. Cardiac ischemia could not be differentiated from skeletal muscle injury solely on the basis of clinical assessment.
Based on long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in B6C3F1 mice conducted by the National Toxicology Program, 2,2-Bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol (BMP) and tetranitromethane (TNM) have been identified as carcinogens. Following 2 yr of exposure to 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm BMP in feed, or exposure to 0.5 or 2 ppm TNM by inhalation, increased incidences of lung neoplasms were observed in B6C3F1 mice at all exposure concentrations compared to unexposed mice. The present study characterizes genetic alterations in the K-ras protooncogene in BMP- and TNM-induced lung neoplasms, respectively, and compares the findings to spontaneous lung neoplasms from corresponding control mice. The frequencies of the K-ras mutations were 57% (29/51) in BMP-induced lung neoplasms compared to 15% (3/20) in lung neoplasms from dosed feed control mice, and 54% (14/26) in TNM-induced lung neoplasms compared to 60% (3/5) in lung neoplasms from inhalation control mice. G --> A transitions at the second base of the K-ras codon 12 (GGT --> GAT) were the most frequent pattern of K-ras mutations identified in BMP-induced (20/29) and TNM-induced lung neoplasms (13/14), which differed from the mutational patterns identified in the lung neoplasms from unexposed control mice. These results indicate that mutations in the K-ras gene are involved in B6C3F1 lung carcinogenesis following BMP- and TNM-exposure, and the high frequency and specificity of the ras mutation profile in lung neoplasms (G --> A transition) may be due to in vivo genotoxicity by the parent compounds or their metabolites.
Colchicine may be a cause of neuropathy. An experimental model to study this is developed.
In facial dermatosurgery, the addition of sympathomimetics to local anaesthetics produces a desirable topical effect by creating an almost bloodless operation field due to transitory vasoconstriction. In an 87-year-old woman suffering from a meningioma that had caused blindness of the left eye, a basal-cell carcinoma was removed from the right side of the nose. The local anaesthetic contained noradrenaline at a concentration of 1:50,000. After the operation, the patient complained of headache and a transient loss of vision. We suggest that noradrenaline caused vasoconstriction of the arteria centralis retinae via arterial periorbital anastomoses. Patients with severe vision disorders should be considered a risk group, in whom sympathomimetics should not be added to local anaesthetics used in skin surgery of the middle and upper face.
Oxidative stress and lipid accumulation play important roles in alcohol-induced liver injury. Previous reports showed that, in livers of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-activated mice, genes involved in antioxidant defense are induced, whereas genes involved in lipid biosynthesis are suppressed. To investigate the role of Nrf2 in ethanol-induced hepatic alterations, Nrf2-null mice, wild-type mice, kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-knockdown (Keap1-KD) mice with enhanced Nrf2, and Keap1-hepatocyte knockout (Keap1-HKO) mice with maximum Nrf2 activation, were treated with ethanol (5 g/kg, po). Blood and liver samples were collected 6h thereafter. Ethanol increased alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase activities as well as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in serum of Nrf2-null and wild-type mice, but not in Nrf2-enhanced mice. After ethanol administration, mitochondrial glutathione concentrations decreased markedly in Nrf2-null mice but not in Nrf2-enhanced mice. H(2)DCFDA staining of primary hepatocytes isolated from the four genotypes of mice indicates that oxidative stress was higher in Nrf2-null cells, and lower in Nrf2-enhanced cells than in wild-type cells. Ethanol increased serum triglycerides and hepatic free fatty acids in Nrf2-null mice, and these increases were blunted in Nrf2-enhanced mice. In addition, the basal mRNA and nuclear protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(Srebp-1) were decreased with graded Nrf2 activation. Ethanol further induced Srebp-1 mRNA in Nrf2-null mice but not in Nrf2-enhanced mice. In conclusion, Nrf2 activation prevented alcohol-induced oxidative stress and accumulation of free fatty acids in liver by increasing genes involved in antioxidant defense and decreasing genes involved in lipogenesis.
This experiment attempted to determine the mechanism by which amphetamine reduces locomotor hyperactivity in neonatal rats given brain dopamine (DA)-depleting 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injections. Brain DA neurons were destroyed selectively in neonatal rats by intraventricular (i.v.t.) injections of 6-OHDA following desmethylimipramine (DMI) pretreatment. Control rats received DMI and i.v.t. injections of the 6-OHDA vehicle solution. Rats given the 6-OHDA treatment displayed 7-fold increases in locomotor activity compared to controls during days 16-55 of life. Throughout this period, amphetamine (1 mg/kg) reduced locomotor hyperactivity in 6-OHDA-treated rats but increased locomotor activity in control rats. The reduction of hyperactivity caused by amphetamine (0.5-4 mg/kg) was dose-related and was not accompanied by stereotyped behavior. Like amphetamine, methylphenidate (4 mg/kg) reduced locomotor hyperactivity in rats given 6-OHDA. The DA antagonist, spiroperidol (50-200 micrograms/kg) failed to attenuate the hyperactivity-reducing effect of amphetamine in 6-OHDA-treated rats at doses which abolished the stimulant effect of amphetamine in control rats. However, the serotonin antagonist methysergide (0.5-4 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent antagonism of the effect of amphetamine in 6-OHDA-treated rats. Pretreatment with propranolol ((5 mg/kg), phentolamine (5 mg/kg), atropine (0.5 mg/kg) or naloxone (10 mg/kg) failed to alter the reduction in locomotor hyperactivity caused by amphetamine. The serotonin releasing agent, fenfluramine (3 mg/kg), and the serotonin agonist, quipazine (0.5-4 mg/kg), both reduced locomotor hyperactivity in 6-OHDA-treated rats while not altering locomotion in control rats. These results confirm previous observations that amphetamine reduces locomotor hyperactivity caused by neonatal 6-OHDA administration and suggest that this effect is mediated by increased serotonergic neurotransmission.
This study was designed to evaluate the effects of nitroglycerin and phenylephrine-induced arterial hypertension on regional myocardial blood flow in awake dogs with acute occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery. Myocardial blood flow to four transmural layers from epicardium to endocardium was estimated with 7-9 micron radionuclide labeled microspheres in 1) the non-ischemic myocardium, 2) the central ischemic zone, and 3) the border zone separating ischemic from normally perfused myocardium. Measurements were repeated 1) during infusion of nitroglycerin, 0.015 mg/kg/min, 2) during phenylephrine administered to increase arterial pressure 60 mm Hg above the control measurements, and 3) during combined nitroglycerin and phenylephrine administration. Both nitroglycerin and phenylephrine increased myocardial blood flow to the central ischemic area; nitroglycerin significantly decreased the resistance of the collateral vascular system, while the increased flow during phenylephrine administration was accounted for entirely by the increased arterial pressure with no change in collateral vascular resistance. The increased blood flow to the central ischemic zone during nitroglycerin administration was delivered preferentially to the subendocardium, while the increased blood flow during phenylephrine administration was directed exclusively to the subepicardium. Neither nitroglycerin nor phenylephrine significantly altered computed vascular resistance of the border zone, but because of the increased driving pressure, blood flow to the border zone was significantly increased during phenylephrine administration.
The risks and benefits of treating hypertension in individuals older than 80 years are uncertain. A meta-analysis has suggested that a reduction in stroke events of 36% may have to be balanced against a 14% increase in total mortality.
To report the results of the pilot study of the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET), which is in progress to address these issues.
The HYVET-Pilot was a multicentre international open pilot trial. In 10 European countries, 1283 patients older than 80 years and with a sustained blood pressure of 160-219/90-109 mmHg were allocated randomly to one of three treatments: a diuretic-based regimen (usually bendroflumethiazide; n = 426), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor regimen (usually lisinopril; n = 431) or no treatment (n = 426). The procedure permitted doses of the drug to be titrated and diltiazem slow-release to be added to active treatment. Target blood pressure was < 150/80 mmHg and mean follow-up was 13 months.
In the combined actively treated groups, the reduction in stroke events relative hazard rate (RHR) was 0.47 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.93] and the reduction in stroke mortality RHR was 0.57 (95% CI 0.25 to 1.32). However, the estimate of total mortality supported the possibility of excess deaths with active treatment (RHR 1.23, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.01).
The preliminary results support the need for the continuing main HYVET trial. It is possible that treatment of 1000 patients for 1 year may reduce stroke events by 19 (nine non-fatal), but may be associated with 20 extra non-stroke deaths.
The anti-convulsant properties of angiotensin IV (Ang IV), an inhibitor of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) and somatostatin-14, a substrate of IRAP, were evaluated in the acute pilocarpine rat seizure model. Simultaneously, the neurochemical changes in the hippocampus were monitored using in vivo microdialysis. Intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered Ang IV or somatostatin-14 caused a significant increase in the hippocampal extracellular dopamine and serotonin levels and protected rats against pilocarpine-induced seizures. These effects of Ang IV were both blocked by concomitant i.c.v. administration of the somatostatin receptor-2 antagonist cyanamid 154806. These results reveal a possible role for dopamine and serotonin in the anti-convulsant effect of Ang IV and somatostatin-14. Our study suggests that the ability of Ang IV to inhibit pilocarpine-induced convulsions is dependent on somatostatin receptor-2 activation, and is possibly mediated via the inhibition of IRAP resulting in an elevated concentration of somatostatin-14 in the brain.
Once defined clinical criteria are fulfilled in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, prognosis without orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) may be very poor. In the present study, we examined the application and outcome of OLT in 548 patients admitted to a single center between 1990 and 1996. Four hundred twenty-four (77%) of the patients studied did not fulfill transplantation criteria, and 396 of these (93%) survived. The majority of the 28 nonsurvivors (7%) in this group fulfilled two of three combined criteria, and the finding of a high APACHE III score could be used as an indicator for the need for OLT. Of the 56 patients (45%) not listed, in only a small proportion was this caused by psychiatric reasons, and in the majority, it was a consequence of the rapid development of multiple organ failure and cerebral edema. This also applied to 24 (35%) of the 68 listed patients in whom the rapidity of clinical deterioration, reflected in increasing APACHE III scores, was such that even with the prompt availability of donor organs, OLT was not possible. In the final event, only 44 (35%) of those who fulfilled criteria underwent OLT, of whom 33 (75%) survived to leave the hospital. Survival was greatest in those receiving unreduced grafts, and markers of early graft function differed significantly between survivors and nonsurvivors. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment in a relatively small number of patients with acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, and for a substantial proportion, transplantation was never an option because of the rapidity of clinical deterioration. APACHE III scoring may be of value in decision making and in better defining patients in clinical trials.
1. This is a report of a patient who developed an acute organic psychosis due to neurotoxicity of lithium several days after tapering off a long-lasting clozapine therapy. 2. The organic brain syndrome with initial illusionary misperceptions, a confusional state and a lapse into a pre-coma developed three days after the end of clozapine therapy and seven days after the beginning of haloperidol addition. 3. Possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors responsible for the severe neurotoxicity of lithium after withdrawal of clozapine and addition of haloperidol are discussed.
A 75-year-old Japanese woman with polycythemia vera was admitted to our hospital in January 2003 with suspected pulmonary thromboembolism. After administration of heparin, platelet count decreased from 1,694 x 10(9)/l on admission to 60 x 10(9)/l on hospital day 14. The patient developed acute limb embolism and transient cerebral ischemic attack on days 17 and 25, respectively. Signs and symptoms mimicked those of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Antibodies against heparin and platelet factor 4 complexes were detected in serum, and a diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis was made. Argatroban treatment improved thrombocytopenia and hypercoagulable state.
The aim of the study was to investigate the alteration in serum matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels after chemotherapy and the association between the changes in serum levels of MMP-9 and response to chemotherapy in patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer.
Twenty-eight consecutive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and 24 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The patients were treated with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. After two cycles, the response was evaluated. Before and after two cycles of chemotherapy, serum samples were collected from the patients.
Prechemotherapy MMP-9 (ng/ml) levels were significantly higher in patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer than in controls (7.2 ± 2.8 vs 4.5 ± 2.1, P <0.001). Prechemotherapy MMP-9 levels were elevated compared to postchemotherapy levels as well (7.2 ± 2.8 vs 5.2 ± 3.3, P = 0.005). Prechemotherapy MMP-9 levels were significantly higher than postchemotherapy MMP-9 levels in patients with partial response (7 patients) (8.2 ± 1.8 and 3.2 ± 2.3, respectively; P = 0.018), but the pre- and postchemotherapy MMP-9 levels were no different in patients with stable disease or progressive disease (21 patients) (7 ± 3.1 and 5.9 ± 3.3, respectively; P = 0.08).
The difference between pre- and postchemotherapy MMP-9 levels in responders was more prominent than that in nonresponders. Whether the decline in serum MMP-9 levels might be used as a marker of response to chemotherapy should be investigated in larger studies.
Although adverse reactions of many kinds caused by propafenone have been observed, yet there has been no documented report of hemolytic reaction. Four episodes of hemolytic reaction in three patients receiving intravenous propafenone were reported. These reactions took place a few hours after the administration and one of the episodes was complicated with acute left ventricular heart failure and shock. Cessation of propafenone administration together with relevant therapeutic measures tide the patients over and hemolysis disappeared in several hours. Toxicological examination revealed no physical or chemical deterioration and biological contamination of the remaining medication and no such reaction was noted when the drug of the same batch was given to other patients. It is considered that the hemolytic episodes were related to allergic constitution of the patients. Judging from the clinical manifestations, these episodes were hemolytic reactions of immune complex type.
To present a single case of ampicillin-induced recurrent cholestasis and a literature review.
A 23-year-old man was hospitalized due to recurrent and self-limited cholestatic symptoms. He had used ampicillin before each cholestatic attack. He became well clinically and biochemically each time after cessation of the drug. One year after his recovery and discontinuance of ampicillin, the patient has had no recurrence of cholestasis. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug reaction was probable.
Ampicillin-related hepatotoxicity is very rare, with injury being mainly hepatocellular. To our knowledge, there is only 1 case report in the literature referring to chronic cholestatic-type hepatotoxicity related to ampicillin.
Ampicillin, which is one of the most widely used antibiotics, may cause recurrent cholestatic hepatitis. Clinicians should be aware of this adverse effect, and it should be kept in mind during diagnostic workup of liver injury.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative progressive currently untreatable disease, characterized by selective motor neuron degeneration; the incidence and prevalence of ALS are greater in men than in women. Although some important mechanisms that might contribute to the death of motor neurons have been identified, the mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology are still uncertain. In particular, the mechanisms underlying the role of gender in ALS and whether treatments should take into account sexual dimorphism remain only partially understood. Recently, the P2X7 receptor for ATP was reported to display neurotoxic potential in motor neuron disorders, and antagonism of the receptor has been suggested to be helpful in these disorders. Studying transgenic mice with superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations, widely used as model for ALS, may provide a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and of toxicity towards motor neurons, also possibly helping to understand whether treatments for ALS should take into account sexual dimorphism. The aim of the work was (1) investigating on gender-dependence of disease progression in the standard model for ALS - the transgenic mouse bearing superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations - and (2) assessing if a P2X7 receptor antagonist treatment should take into account sexual dimorphism. We evaluated if gender affect the disease course, the motor performance, the weight loss and the lifespan in mice overexpressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1. We measured motor impairment, motor strength and coordination by rotarod and grip strength testing. Further, we assessed if a treatment with the P2X7 receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue G - a dye that can cross the blood-brain barrier, has low toxicity, and has exhibited therapeutic effects in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases - impact on the disease progression, in male and female ALS mice. We found that (1) the onset and the disease progression, and the survival were dependent on gender: male performed worst than female, lost body weight and died before; (2) treatment with the P2X7 receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue G ameliorated the disease progression. The treatment effect was gender-dependent: amelioration was greater in male than in female. In conclusions, we suggest that not only pathogenetic mechanism of motor neuron toxicity but also the drug treatment effectiveness may depend on gender; sexual dimorphism should be considered when investigating on ALS treatment efficacy in the ALS animal model. Our findings also point on the potential relevance of P2X7 receptor antagonism for ALS treatment, and highlight the importance of adopting a sex-specific approach to searching for treatment of ALS.
Candidate predictive biomarkers for irinotecan and oxaliplatin were assessed in 1,628 patients in Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, CPT-11: Use and Sequencing (FOCUS), a large randomized trial of fluorouracil alone compared with fluorouracil and irinotecan and compared with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in advanced colorectal cancer.
The candidate biomarkers were: tumor immunohistochemistry for MLH1/MSH2, p53, topoisomerase-1 (Topo1), excision repair cross-complementing gene 1 (ERCC1), O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltranserase (MGMT), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2); germline DNA polymorphisms in GSTP1, ABCB1, XRCC1, ERCC2, and UGT1A1. These were screened in more than 750 patients for interaction with benefit from irinotecan or oxaliplatin; two markers (Topo1 and MLH1/MSH2) met criteria to be taken forward for analysis in the full population. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.
One thousand three hundred thirteen patients (81%) were assessable for Topo1 immunohistochemistry (low, < 10%; moderate, 10% to 50%; or high, > 50% tumor nuclei). In patients with low Topo1, PFS was not improved by the addition of either irinotecan (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.22) or oxaliplatin (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.07); conversely, patients with moderate/high Topo1 benefited from the addition of either drug (HR, 0.48 to 0.70 in all categories; interaction P = .005; overall, P = .001 for irinotecan; P = .05 for oxaliplatin). High Topo1 was associated with a major overall survival benefit with first-line combination chemotherapy (HR, 0.60; median benefit, 5.3 months); patients with moderate or low Topo1 did not benefit (HR, 0.92 and 1.09, respectively; interaction P = .005). MLH1/MSH2 did not show significant interaction with treatment, although the low rate of loss (4.4%) limits the power of the study for this biomarker.
Topo1 immunohistochemistry identified subpopulations that did or did not benefit from irinotecan, and possibly also from oxaliplatin. If verified independently, this information will contribute to the individualization of treatment for colorectal cancer.
