This is a report of 3 cases of ocular damage which occurred during t he use of oral contraceptives. A 21-year-old woman experienced sudden loss of vision in her right eye after 4 months of combination type oral contraceptive therapy. Ocular tension was normal; the fundus showed occlusion of the central retinal artery. The other eye was normal. Anticoagulant medications were given iv and orally. The next day vision was improved and some restoration of circulation to the retina was noted. After 18 months vision and visual fields were normal in both eyes. In another case a 42-year-old patient experienced sudden loss of vision in her left eye. She had been taking contraceptive pills for 14 months. The right eye was normal. The fundus of the left eye showed evidence of acute occlusion of the central artery of the retina with only the temporal side of the field of vision retained. The oral contraceptive was discontinued and anticoagulation medication given. No improvement occurred. After 6 months total occlusion of the lower temporal artery remained. The third case, 1 21-year-old woman, complained of progressive blurring vision in the right eye for 2 weeks. She had taken oral contraceptives following a normal delivery 7 months previously but had stopped medication 1 month before admission. The affected eye showed a central scotoma and a markedly restricted visual field. Anticoaguland drugs and vitamin-B were given. After 7 days vision was markedly improved and the central scotoma had decreased in size. After another week vision and visual fields were normal. In this case an optic neuritis due to occlusion of a branch of the retinal artery was thought to have been present. Immediate therapy for such cases is important. Since estrogens have been implicated in the etiology of thromboembolic disease, smaller doses of this steroid (50 instead of 80 mcg) are recommended.
Pain on injection, reported in 28-90% of patients, is one of the most described side effects of the intravenous application of propofol. Many different approaches have been used in attempts to minimize propofol induced pain, with varied results. Using a randomized, double-blind protocol design, the author-section pain following the administration of two different particle size formulations of propofol with or without lidocaine in 388 nonpremedicated ASA I-II adult patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were allocated randomly to receive either a small particle size lipid emulsion of propofol (Anepol: average particle size 140.5 nm), or standard propofol (Propofol: average particle size 193.3 nm), by dividing into 4 groups. Group 1 received 2 ml NaCl 0.9% and Propofol, group 11 received 2 ml lidocaine 2% and Propofol, group III received 2 ml NaCl 0.9% and Anepol and group IV received 2 ml lidocaine 2% and Anepol into a dorsal vein of the hand. Pain during propofol injection was evaluated over 5-10 seconds, until loss of conscious, using a four point scale. Sixty-seven patients (69.1%) complained of pain in group 1, as compared with 50%, 41.2% and 39.2% in group II, III and IV (p < 0.05). The reported severity of injection pain was not significantly different between the groups. The authors conclude that small particle size propofol causes less pain on injection than standard propofol.
Bromodichloromethane (BDCM) and tribromomethane given by corn oil gavage were previously found to induce neoplasia in the large intestine of rats. Our chronic bioassay of BDCM administered in drinking water failed to produce colon neoplasia in male F344/N rats. We recently reported that BDCM induces aberrant crypt foci (ACF), putative precursor lesions in the development of colon cancer, when included in the drinking water of male rats. To investigate whether ACF induced by BDCM could be promoted by corn oil (CO), male F344/N rats were exposed to 0.7 g BDCM/L in drinking water or 50 mg BDCM/kg body weight by oral gavage in CO. Animals exposed to drinking water, CO, or 15 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM) (ip) constituted the negative, vehicle, and positive controls. After 26 wk, colons were examined for ACF. A significant decrease in water consumption was observed in both the positive controls and BDCM-treated animals; however, no difference was noted in final body weight. The administration of CO to AOM-exposed animals produced a significant increase in total ACF when compared to AOM alone. BDCM produced a significant increase in ACF when compared to control, but no difference was noticed between BDCM exposure by oral CO gavage and control. Additionally, no difference was noted between BDCM exposure by drinking water and by oral CO gavage. This study demonstrates that the formation of ACF is independent of the route of BDCM exposure (drinking water vs. oral corn oil gavage), with both routes producing similar ACF values of 1.33 +/- 0.49 and 1.5 +/- 0.51 ACF/colon.
Many patients with Parkinson disease (PD) suffer from nonmotor symptoms including depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, decreased energy level, and an overall decline in quality of life. Comorbid depression, hypothyroidism, and sleep disorders may account for some, but not all, of these problems. Testosterone deficiency affects 20% to 25% of males over the age of 60 years in the general population and may cause signs and symptoms of the nonmotor symptoms seen in PD. We observed numerous patients with PD whose nonmotor symptoms were refractory to treatment.
To determine whether treatment of comorbid testosterone deficiency in male patients with PD can lead to improvements in refractory nonmotor symptoms.
Case studies were reviewed of the first 5 male patients who had PD with symptoms of testosterone deficiency who were treated in our clinic. All patients had low serum testosterone levels. Screening for testosterone deficiency symptoms using the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Questionnaire was performed for 4 of the 5 patients. Additionally, to assess the prevalence of PD, total testosterone levels in 68 patients in our PD registry were sent for evaluation.
Following testosterone replacement therapy, all 5 patients experienced significant improvements in their refractory nonmotor symptoms. Of 68 male patients with PD enrolled in our PD registry, 24 (35%) had plasma evidence of testosterone deficiency. We also noted that the risk of testosterone deficiency per decade was found to increase 2.8-fold per decade (P<.001), paralleling that which is found in the general elderly male population.
The findings from this study reveal the heretofore unrecognized high prevalence of testosterone deficiency in elderly male patients with PD similar to that found in the general population. These symptoms, which may be refractory to antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antiparkinsonian medications, may respond to treatment with testosterone. More rigorous controlled studies will need to be undertaken to examine the treatment of this common comorbidity in male patients with PD.
At this meeting, novel analgesic effects were described for a number of compounds. Gabapentin was significantly effective in the treatment of pain associated with phantom limb pain after amputation and traumatic avulsion of the brachial plexus. Capsaicin analog, EC-665, prevented referred viscero-somatic hyperalgesia associated with bladder inflammation. Indomethacine was compared with UP-454-21, a selective COX-2 inhibitor showing comparable effectiveness between both drugs in their anti-inflammatory/analgesic properties. Contralateral treatment with local anesthetics resulted in a long-lasting anti-inflammatory effect in unilateral carra-geenan-induced inflammation. Spinal neostigmine reduced spinal bupivacaine-induced hypotension while lamo-trigine showed a definite benefit in varied patients with neuropathic pain. Intra-articular administration of a ketorolac and morphine combination following arthroscopic knee surgery showed a significant decrease in postoperative pain and the need for postoperative analgesic. Oral CR oxycodone was shown to be an effective analgesic for the oral management of postoperative pain.
We evaluated the effects of zonisamide on inflammatory and neuropathic pain using the mouse formalin test and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice with a reduced withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimuli, respectively. When administered systemically (subcutaneously, s.c.), intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or intrathecally (i.t.) before formalin injection, zonisamide (3 and 10 mg/kg, s.c., 10 and 30 microg, i.c.v., or i.t.) significantly reduced licking/biting behavior during the second phase of the formalin test in a dose-dependent manner. However, zonisamide (30 microg, i.t.) did not affect the second phase of the formalin test when given after the first phase, suggesting that it can prevent the development of injury-induced hyperexcitability of the spinal dorsal horn triggered by the repetitive nociceptive input during the first phase. Moreover, zonisamide administered into the dorsal hindpaw ipsilateral but not contralateral to the formalin injection partly reduced the second phase. Thus it is likely that zonisamide generates analgesic effects in the formalin test via both central and peripheral mechanisms. In mice with STZ-induced diabetes, zonisamide (10 and 30 mg/kg, s.c. or 10 and 30 mug, i.t.) reversed the mechanical hyperexcitability. Our results suggest that zonisamide can be a useful therapeutic agent, presumably for both prevention and reversal of pathophysiologic pain.
Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with MLL rearrangements (MLL-R) represents a distinct leukemia with a poor prognosis. To define its mutational landscape, we performed whole-genome, exome, RNA and targeted DNA sequencing on 65 infants (47 MLL-R and 18 non-MLL-R cases) and 20 older children (MLL-R cases) with leukemia. Our data show that infant MLL-R ALL has one of the lowest frequencies of somatic mutations of any sequenced cancer, with the predominant leukemic clone carrying a mean of 1.3 non-silent mutations. Despite this paucity of mutations, we detected activating mutations in kinase-PI3K-RAS signaling pathway components in 47% of cases. Surprisingly, these mutations were often subclonal and were frequently lost at relapse. In contrast to infant cases, MLL-R leukemia in older children had more somatic mutations (mean of 6.5 mutations/case versus 1.3 mutations/case, P = 7.15 × 10(-5)) and had frequent mutations (45%) in epigenetic regulators, a category of genes that, with the exception of MLL, was rarely mutated in infant MLL-R ALL.
Transcriptional elongation is critical for gene expression regulation during embryogenesis. The super elongation complex (SEC) governs this process by mobilizing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAP2). Using exome sequencing, we discovered missense mutations in AFF4, a core component of the SEC, in three unrelated probands with a new syndrome that phenotypically overlaps Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) that we have named CHOPS syndrome (C for cognitive impairment and coarse facies, H for heart defects, O for obesity, P for pulmonary involvement and S for short stature and skeletal dysplasia). Transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses demonstrated similar alterations of genome-wide binding of AFF4, cohesin and RNAP2 in CdLS and CHOPS syndrome. Direct molecular interaction of the SEC, cohesin and RNAP2 was demonstrated. These data support a common molecular pathogenesis for CHOPS syndrome and CdLS caused by disturbance of transcriptional elongation due to alterations in genome-wide binding of AFF4 and cohesin.
Intrathecal baclofen therapy by the continuous intrathecal infusion of baclofen has been shown to be an effective treatment for spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and other disorders. To demonstrate the efficacy and safety of intrathecal baclofen therapy, we investigated the muscle relaxant and neurotoxic activities of intrathecal baclofen in rats, compared with intravenous baclofen. Intrathecal and intravenous administration of baclofen dose-dependently inhibited the anemic decerebrate rigidity with ED(50) values of 0.31microg/animal (=1.1-1.3microg/kg) and 0.43mg/kg, respectively. Intrathecal administration of baclofen induced no noticeable changes in a spontaneous electroencephalogram at 30microg/animal. Intravenous administration of baclofen induced an abnormal electroencephalogram with flat waves in all the animals and the no-observed-effect level was estimated to be 5mg/kg. In some animals, intravenous administration of baclofen induced sporadic spikes or sharp waves with background flat waves, indicating inhibitory and excitatory effects on the central nervous system. In conclusion, intrathecal administration of baclofen dose-dependently inhibited anemic decerebrate rigidity in rats and the effective dose was more than 300 times lower than that of intravenous baclofen. The safety margin of intrathecal baclofen was greater than that of intravenous baclofen (> or =97 versus 12). These results suggest that intrathecal baclofen therapy is superior to systemic baclofen therapy in both efficacy and safety.
Baclofen is a central nervous system agent that is commonly used for the treatment of muscle spasticity in spinal cord injury patients. Acute withdrawal of this medication can induce the development of neurological symptoms, including seizure disorder, psychosis, hallucinations and visual disturbances. We report 3 cases of acute central nervous system symptoms that developed in spinal cord injury patients. Each patient had been chronically maintained on a baclofen regimen to control muscle spasticity. Symptoms developed shortly after baclofen therapy was interrupted following genitourinary surgery. It is important that urologists become familiar with the symptomatology of baclofen withdrawal, the methods of its prevention and the appropriate therapy should the syndrome develop.
Although earlier reports highlighted a tumor suppressor role for manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), recent evidence indicates increased expression in a variety of human cancers including aggressive breast carcinoma. In the present article, we hypothesized that MnSOD expression is significantly amplified in the aggressive breast carcinoma basal subtype, and targeting MnSOD could be an attractive strategy for enhancing chemosensitivity of this highly aggressive breast cancer subtype.
Using MDA-MB-231 and BT549 as a model of basal breast cancer cell lines, we show that knockdown of MnSOD decreased the colony-forming ability and sensitized the cells to drug-induced cell death, while drug resistance was associated with increased MnSOD expression. In an attempt to develop a clinically relevant approach to down-regulate MnSOD expression in patients with basal breast carcinoma, we employed activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) to repress MnSOD expression; PPARγ activation significantly reduced MnSOD expression, increased chemosensitivity, and inhibited tumor growth. Moreover, as a proof of concept for the clinical use of PPARγ agonists to decrease MnSOD expression, biopsies derived from breast cancer patients who had received synthetic PPARγ ligands as anti-diabetic therapy had significantly reduced MnSOD expression. Finally, we provide evidence to implicate peroxynitrite as the mechanism involved in the increased sensitivity to chemotherapy induced by MnSOD repression.
These data provide evidence to link increased MnSOD expression with the aggressive basal breast cancer, and underscore the judicious use of PPARγ ligands for specifically down-regulating MnSOD to increase the chemosensitivity of this subtype of breast carcinoma.
A 45-year-old woman with intractable cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis was successfully treated with total cystectomy and ileal neobladder substitution. To our knowledge this is the first reported reconstruction of the lower urinary tract in a patient with acute hemorrhagic cystitis using a neobladder. Neobladder substitution is contraindicated if the urethra or bladder neck is involved in the disease, although neither was involved in our patient. Whether these lesions are generally left intact has not been discussed previously. If a neobladder can be used, life threatening hemorrhagic cystitis should be treated with total cystectomy accompanied by immediate neobladder substitution.
Second- and third-generation cephalosporins, especially cefotetan, are increasingly associated with severe, sometimes fatal immune hemolytic anemia. We noticed that 10 of our 35 cases of cefotetan-induced hemolytic anemias were in patients who had received cefotetan prophylactically for obstetric and gynecologic procedures. Eight of these cases of severe immune hemolytic anemia are described.
The present investigation employed meta-analytic procedures to quantitatively evaluate the empirical evidence on the relationship between drug abuse and aggression between intimate partners. Data from 96 studies yielding 547 effect sizes indicated that increases in drug use and drug-related problems were significantly associated with increases in aggression between intimate partners (d= .27). Cocaine emerged as the illicit substance with the strongest relationship to psychological, physical, and sexual aggression (ds= .39 to .62). Marijuana was also identified as having a significant association with partner aggression. Results showed comparable effect sizes for men and women, regardless of the sex of the drug user and/or perpetrator of partner aggression, with female reports of aggression having yielded larger effect sizes than male reports. Moderator analyses revealed that relative to other groups, married or cohabiting couples and Black participants evidenced significantly stronger effect sizes. The findings are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms linking drugs to partner aggression, and implications for future research are discussed in terms of focusing on conducting studies that assess the interaction of context and temporal sequencing of drugs and partner aggression.
The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of alpidem, a new imidazopyridine derivative with benzodiazepine-like anxiolytic effects, with those of lorazepam and placebo on memory and attention in two age groups of healthy volunteers. The study design was that of a randomized double-blind crossover trial with 12 young (18-30 years old) and 12 elderly (65-80) subjects. At weekly intervals, each subject was administered single oral doses of 25 mg alpidem, 50 mg alpidem, 1 mg lorazepam, and placebo in a randomized sequence. Computerized memory and attention tests were performed 90 minutes before and 320 minutes after drug administration. Lorazepam and alpidem 50 mg produced memory impairments: for verbal memory tests the difference against placebo was highly significant for both drugs, while for visual memory this impairment was significant for lorazepam only. No memory effects were seen with 25 mg alpidem. There were no significant drug effects on attention, suggesting a specific amnestic effect not explained by general sedation. Performance of the elderly subjects was much lower than that of the younger ones in both memory and attention tasks. It was not possible to observe any interaction effects between drug and age.
Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most important occupational diseases and, after presbyacusis, the most frequent cause of hearing loss. NIHL is a complex disease caused by an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. The various environmental factors involved in NIHL have been relatively extensively studied. On the other hand, little research has been performed on the genetic factors responsible for NIHL. To test whether the variation in genes involved in coupling of cells and potassium recycling in the inner ear might partly explain the variability in susceptibility to noise, we performed a case-control association study using 35 SNPs selected in 10 candidate genes on a total of 218 samples selected from a population of 1,261 Swedish male noise-exposed workers. We have obtained significant differences between susceptible and resistant individuals for the allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies for three SNPs of the KCNE1 gene, and for the allele frequencies for one SNP of KCNQ1 and one SNP of KCNQ4. Patch-clamp experiments in high K+-concentrations using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell model were performed to investigate the possibility that the KCNE1-p.85N variant (NT_011512.10:g.21483550G>A; NP_00210.2:p.Asp85Asn) was causative for high noise susceptibility. The normalized current density generated by KCNQ1/KCNE1-p.85N channels, thus containing the susceptibility variant, differed significantly from that from wild-type channels. Furthermore, the midpoint potential of KCNQ1/KCNE1-p.85N channels (i.e., the voltage at which 50% of the channels are open) differed from that of wild-type channels. Further genetic and physiological studies will be necessary to confirm these findings.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of aging related dementia and has been extensively studied by several groups around the world. A general consensus, based on neuropathology, genetics and cellular and animal models, is that the 4 kDa amyloid β protein (Aβ) triggers a toxic cascade that induces microtubule-associated protein τ (MAPT) hyperphosphorylation and deposition. Together, these lesions lead to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration, modeled in animals, that ultimately causes dementia. Genetic studies show that a simple duplication of the Aβ precursor (APP) gene, as occurs in Down syndrome (trisomy 21), with a 1.5-fold increase in expression, can cause dementia with the complete AD associated neuropathology. The most fully characterized form of AD is early onset familial AD (FAD). Unfortunately, by far the most common form of AD is late onset AD (LOAD). FAD has well-identified autosomally dominant genetic causes, absent in LOAD. It is reasonable to hypothesize that environmental influences play a much stronger role in etiology of LOAD than of FAD. Since AD pathology in LOAD closely resembles FAD with accumulation of both Aβ and MAPT, it is likely that the environmental factors foster accumulation of these proteins in a manner similar to FAD mutations. Therefore, it is important to identify environmentally driven changes that "phenocopy" FAD in order to find ways to prevent LOAD. Epigenetic changes in expression are complex but stable determinants of many complex traits. Some aspects are regulated by prenatal and early post-natal development, others punctuate specific periods of maturation, and still others occur throughout life, mediating predictable changes that take place during various developmental stages. Environmental agents such as mercury, lead, and pesticides can disrupt the natural epigenetic program and lead to developmental deficits, mental retardation, feminization, and other complex syndromes. In this review we discuss latent early- life associated regulation (LEARn), where apparently temporary changes, induced by environmental agents, become latent and present themselves again at maturity or senescence to increase production of Aβ that may cause AD. The model provides us with a novel direction for identifying potentially harmful agents that may induce neurodegeneration and dementia later in life and provides hope that we may be able to prevent age-related neurodegenerative disease by "detoxifying" our environment.
Terazosin is a selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period study evaluated the effects of posture and of oral and intravenous administration of terazosin on blood pressure and heart rate in patients with hypertension. At least one week after withdrawal of all antihypertensive medications, 31 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 114 mmHg were enrolled in the study. After a 24-hour, single-blind, placebo lead-in phase, the patients were randomized to receive either oral terazosin (1 mg on day 1, 2 mg on day 2, and 5 mg on days 3 and 4), a 12-hour intravenous infusion of terazosin (2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 7.5 mg), or placebo for 4 consecutive days. Head-up tilt (60 degrees for 20 minutes) evaluations were performed before and 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 6, 12, and 16 hours after start of administration during the placebo lead-in phase and on each of the 4 days of the double-blind treatment phase. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored every 2 minutes during the 20-minute tilt. Statistically significantly larger mean changes in blood pressure and heart rate were observed with the 7.5-mg intravenous dose of terazosin compared with those after oral terazosin or placebo. With respect to intravenous terazosin, the orthostatic changes were maximal on the first day of the 4-day treatment and increased with increasing doses of terazosin. Maximum orthostatic changes in blood pressure after oral administration of terazosin were not significantly different from those observed with placebo. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events during tilt were dizziness and nausea. Dizziness occurred more frequently with intravenous terazosin than with oral terazosin. The results of this study indicate that oral dose titration of terazosin rather than a slower rate of terazosin infusion minimized the postural effects on blood pressure and associated symptoms during head-up tilt.
The majority of breast cancers are oestrogen dependent and in postmenopausal women the supply of oestrogens in breast tissue is derived from the peripheral conversion of circulating androgens. There is, however, a paradox concerning the epidemiology of breast cancer and the dietary intake of phytoestrogens that bind weakly to oestrogen receptors and initiate oestrogen-dependent transcription. In Eastern countries, such as Japan, the incidence of breast cancer is approximately one-third that of Western countries whilst their high dietary intake of phytoestrogens, mainly in the form of soy products, can produce circulating levels of phytoestrogens that are known experimentally to have oestrogenic effects. Indeed, their weak oestrogenicity has been used to advantage by herbalist medicine to promote soy products as a natural alternative to conventional hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Such usage could increase in light of recent evidence that long-term HRT usage may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer with a consequent reduction in prescription rates. So, are phytoestrogens safe as a natural alternative to HRT and could they be promoters or protectors of breast cancer? If they are promoters, then we must assume that it is due to their oestrogenic effect. If they are protectors, then other actions of phytoestrogens, including their ability to inhibit enzymes that are responsible for converting androgens and weak oestrogens into oestradiol, must be considered. This paper addresses these questions by reviewing the actions of phytoestrogens on oestrogen receptors and key enzymes that convert androgens to oestrogens in relation to the growth of breast cancer cells. In addition, it compares the experimental and epidemiological evidence pertinent to the potential beneficial or harmful effects of phytoestrogens in relation to the incidence/progression of breast cancer and their efficacy as natural alternatives to conventional HRT.
The combination of oleoyl-estrone (OE) and a selective beta3-adrenergic agonist (B3A; CL316,243) treatment in rats results in a profound and rapid wasting of body reserves (lipid).
In the present study we investigated the effect of OE (oral gavage) and/or B3A (subcutaneous constant infusion) administration for 10 days to overweight male rats, compared with controls, on three distinct white adipose tissue (WAT) sites: subcutaneous inguinal, retroperitoneal and epididymal. Tissue weight, DNA (and, from these values cellularity), cAMP content and the expression of several key energy handling metabolism and control genes were analyzed and computed in relation to the whole site mass.
Both OE and B3A significantly decreased WAT mass, with no loss of DNA (cell numbers). OE decreased and B3A increased cAMP. Gene expression patterns were markedly different for OE and B3A. OE tended to decrease expression of most genes studied, with no changes (versus controls) of lipolytic but decrease of lipogenic enzyme genes. The effects of B3A were widely different, with a generalized increase in the expression of most genes, including the adrenergic receptors, and, especially the uncoupling protein UCP1.
OE and B3A, elicit widely different responses in WAT gene expression, end producing similar effects, such as shrinking of WAT, loss of fat, maintenance of cell numbers. OE acted essentially on the balance of lipolysis-lipogenesis and the blocking of the uptake of substrates; its decrease of synthesis favouring lipolysis. B3A induced a shotgun increase in the expression of most regulatory systems in the adipocyte, an effect that in the end favoured again the loss of lipid; this barely selective increase probably produces inefficiency, which coupled with the increase in UCP1 expression may help WAT to waste energy through thermogenesis.
There were considerable differences in the responses of the three WAT sites. OE in general lowered gene expression and stealthily induced a substrate imbalance. B3A increasing the expression of most genes enhanced energy waste through inefficiency rather than through specific pathway activation. There was not a synergistic effect between OE and B3A in WAT, but their combined action increased WAT energy waste.
Carvedilol, a new vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and a potent antioxidant, produces a high degree of cardioprotection in a variety of experimental models of ischemic cardiac injury. Recent clinical studies in patients with heart failure have demonstrated that carvedilol reduces morbidity and mortality and inhibits cardiac remodeling. The present study was designed to explore whether the protective effects of carvedilol on the ischemic myocardium include inhibition of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and, if so, to determine its mechanism of action. Anesthetized rabbits were subjected to 30 minutes of coronary artery occlusion followed by 4 hours of reperfusion. Detection of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was based on the presence of nucleosomal DNA fragments on agarose gels (DNA ladder) and in situ nick end labeling. Carvedilol (1 mg/kg IV), administered 5 minutes before reperfusion, reduced the number of apoptotic myocytes in the ischemic area from 14.7 +/- 0.4% to 3.4 +/- 1.8% (77% reduction, P<.001). Propranolol, administered at equipotent beta-blocking dosage, reduced the number of apoptotic myocytes to 8.9 +/- 2.1% (39% reduction, P<.05). DNA ladders were observed in the hearts of all six vehicle-treated rabbits but only one of six carvedilol-treated rabbits (P<.01). Immunocytochemical analysis of rabbit hearts demonstrated an upregulation of Fas protein in ischemic cardiomyocytes, and treatment with carvedilol reduced both the intensity of staining as well as the area stained. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion led to a rapid activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in the ischemic area but not in nonischemic regions. SAPK activity was increased from 2.1 +/- 0.3 mU/mg (basal) to 8.9 +/- 0.8 mU/mg after 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 20 minutes of reperfusion. Carvedilol inhibited the activation of SAPK by 53.4 +/- 6.5% (P<.05). Under the same conditions, propranolol (1 mg/kg) had no effect on SAPK activation. Taken together, these results suggest that carvedilol prevents myocardial ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes possibly by downregulation of the SAPK signaling pathway, by inhibition of Fas receptor expression, and by beta-adrenergic blockade. The former two actions represent novel and important mechanisms that may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of carvedilol.
Sixteen patients with Parkinson's disease and therapeutic response fluctuations entered an open-label trial of a controlled-release carbidopa/levodopa preparation, Sinemet CR4. Sinemet CR4 behaved as a slow release preparation. At the end of 6 weeks CR4 treatment, there was an increase in percent "on" time and mean interdose interval; the number of daily doses and "off" periods were diminished and a slight reduction in the variability of plasma levodopa levels was observed. Overall benefit waned over the next 6 months, despite addition of standard levodopa or Sinemet to overcome the delayed onset of antiparkinsonian effect of CR4 which resulted from prolongation in the Tmax for levodopa. The major benefits of CR4 were reduction in off time and in the number of daily off periods, with fewer levodopa doses per day and prolongation of the interdose interval.
The presence of vascular invasion in hepatocellular cancer (HCC) correlates with prognosis, and is a critical determinant of both the therapeutic approach and the recurrence or intrahepatic metastases. The authors sought to identify candidate therapeutic agents capable of targeting the invasive phenotype in HCC.
A gene expression signature associated with vascular invasion derived from 81 human cases of HCC was used to screen a database of 453 genomic profiles associated with 164 bioactive molecules using the connectivity map. Candidate agents were identified by their inverse correlation to the query gene signature. The efficacy of the candidate agents to target invasion was experimentally verified in PLC/PRF-5 and HepG2 HCC cells.
The gene signature associated with vascular invasion in HCC comprised of 47 up-regulated and 26 down-regulated genes. Computational bioinformatics analysis revealed several putative candidates, including resveratrol and 17-allylamino-geldanamycin (17-AAG). Both of these agents reduced HCC cell invasion at noncytotoxic concentrations. 17-AAG, a heat shock protein 90 (HSP-90) inhibitor, was shown to modulate the expression of several diverse cancer-associated genes, including ADAMTS1, part of the query signature, and maspin, an HSP-90-associated protein with a tumor suppressor role in HCC.
Candidates for further evaluation as therapies to limit invasion in HCC have been identified using a computational bioinformatics analysis of phenotype-associated gene expression. Phenotype targeting using genomic profiling is a rational approach for drug discovery. Therapeutic strategies targeting a defined cancer-associated phenotype can be identified without a detailed knowledge of individual downstream targets.
A fifty-six-year-old white male diabetic developed leukocytoclastic angiitis after treatment with clindamycin for an infected foot ulcer. The eruption subsided following withdrawal of the drug, recurred when it was re-administered, and cleared after it was again withdrawn. Clindamycin or lincomycin allergy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of leukocytoclastic angiitis in patients who take these drugs.
We tested the effects of daily melatonin treatment on the growth of the ascites hepatoma in rats, determining survival time, cell number and cell cycle phases at various stages of tumor development. Melatonin inhibited cellular proliferation, doubled mean life-time and increased survival. Thymidine incorporation in hepatoma cells from treated rats decreased significantly without changes in the apoptotic index. Flow cytometric analysis showed that melatonin slowed cell cycle progression by increasing the number of cells in phase G0G1. Thus, similar to in vitro models, melatonin's oncostatic action in vivo appears to be directed to specific cell cycle mechanisms, which remain to be elucidated.
