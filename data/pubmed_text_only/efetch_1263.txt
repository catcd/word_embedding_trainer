A 10-year multicentre analysis of the frequency of sensitivity to common preservatives collected in 16 centres in 11 countries has shown stable but persisting high levels of sensitivity to formaldehyde and 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one + 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MCI/MI). It has also revealed a significant increase in the level of reactivity to methyldibromoglutaronitrile (MDBGN) from 0.7% in 1991 to 3.5% in 2000. The current high level of sensitivity to MDBGN requires an urgent safety re-evaluation and risk assessment update along with consideration of immediate lowering of use concentrations, especially in leave-on products.
Exacerbation of ventricular arrhythmias by antiarrhythmic drugs the lignocaine-type has not been reported previously. In this paper we describe three patients with a variety of ventricular arrhythmias who were treated with tocainide and developed worsening of the ventricular arrhythmias. In one patient, frequent ventricular ectopic beats were converted to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in another, nonsustained VT was converted to sustained VT, and in a third, monomorphic VT was converted to multimorphic VT. These patients illustrate the need for careful supervision of antiarrhythmic therapy for VT, even when lignocaine-like drugs are being used.
Twelve weeks of naltrexone significantly improves drinking outcomes in alcoholics; however, the clinical benefits of naltrexone decline shortly after treatment is discontinued.
The present study investigated whether extended treatment with naltrexone significantly improved drinking outcomes.
One hundred forty-six alcohol-dependent patients received broad spectrum treatment or motivational enhancement therapy and either 12 or 24 weeks of naltrexone. The primary dependent variables were percent days abstinent and percent heavy drinking days.
Using an intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences in percent days abstinence or percent heavy drinking days at the end of phase 2 between patients who received 24 weeks of treatment with naltrexone (chi = 63.23) or patients who received 12 weeks of treatment with naltrexone followed by 12 weeks of treatment with placebo (chi = 65.82). Similarly, the average percent heavy drinking days was not significantly different at the end of phase 2 between the group that received 24 weeks of naltrexone (chi = 21.9) and the group that received 12 weeks of naltrexone followed by 12 weeks of placebo (chi = 22.14). Medication compliance was low in the second phase of the study. Drinking outcomes declined with declining compliance whether patients were taking naltrexone or placebo.
The results of this study suggest that administering naltrexone beyond an initial 12 weeks of treatment may not be beneficial to all patients and should be administered along with close medical monitoring to insure compliance.
Drug-induced organ injury is a multifaceted process, involving numerous cell types and mediators, and remains a significant safety issue in pharmaceutical development and clinical therapy. Organotypic in vitro models, including precision-cut tissue slices, possess the multi-cellular, structural and functional features of in vivo tissue to facilitate the elucidation of mechanisms of drug-induced organ injury and to characterize species susceptibilities. This study reviews diclofenac-induced hepatotoxicity and presents data comparing the metabolism, specific binding of diclofenac products to cellular proteins and the effects on liver function in rat, monkey and human liver slices. Concentration- and time-dependent increases in specific protein binding demonstrate the progressive nature of the toxicity. Altered liver function correlated with the species differences in the extent of diclofenac metabolism (rat>monkey or human). Liver injury was not detectable within 24h, unlike specific protein binding, yet it developed by 48 h and lower concentrations of diclofenac exhibited effects by 72 h, demonstrating that continued metabolism and the accumulation of specific protein binding could lead to altered cell function. The decline of liver slice ATP levels at concentrations not affecting GSH levels implicates mitochondrial dysfunction as a primary indicator of hepatotoxicity, of which oxidative stress may be a contributing cause. Diclofenac affected monkey liver slices function at similar concentrations as rat liver slices, while human liver slices exhibited less extensive specific protein binding and required higher diclofenac concentrations to alter cell function.
The prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to exert a chemopreventive effect in esophageal and other gastrointestinal tumors. The precise mechanism by which this occurs, however, is unknown. While the inhibition of COX-2 as a potential explanation for this chemopreventive effect has gained a great deal of support, there also exists evidence supporting the presence of cyclooxygenase-independent pathways through which NSAIDs may exert their effects. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis of 29 Barrett's epithelial samples and 60 esophageal adenocarcinomas demonstrated abundant expression of the COX-2 protein in Barrett's epithelium, but marked heterogeneity of expression in esophageal adenocarcinomas. The three esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines, Flo-1, Bic-1, and Seg-1, also demonstrated varying expression patterns for COX-1 and COX-2. Indomethacin induced apoptosis in all three cell lines, however, in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. In Flo-1 cells, which expressed almost undetectable levels of COX-1 and COX-2, and in Seg-1, which expressed significant levels of COX-1 and COX-2, indomethacin caused upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. The upregulation of Bax was accompanied by the translocation of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytoplasm, and activation of caspase 9. Pre-treatment of both cell lines with the specific caspase 9 inhibitor, z-LEHD-FMK, as well as the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK, blocked the effect of indomethacin-induced apoptosis. These data demonstrate that induction of apoptosis by indomethacin in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells is associated with the upregulation of Bax expression and mitochondrial cytochrome c translocation, and does not correlate with the expression of COX-2. This may have important implications for identifying new therapeutic targets in this deadly disease.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of manganese (Mn) deficiency on chondrocyte development in tibia growth plate. Ninety 1-day-old Arbor Acres chicks were randomly divided into three groups and fed on control diet (60 mg Mn/kg diet) and manganese deficient diets (40 mg Mn/kg diet, manganese deficiency group I; 8.7 mg Mn/kg diet, manganese deficiency group II), respectively. The width of the proliferative zone of growth plate was measured by the microscope graticule. Chondrocyte apoptosis was estimated by TUNEL staining. Gene expression of p21 and Bcl-2, and expression of related proteins were analyzed by quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Compared with the control group, manganese deficiency significantly decreased the proliferative zone width and Bcl-2 mRNA expression level, while significantly increased the apoptotic rates and the expression level of p21 gene in chondrocytes. The results indicate that manganese deficiency had a negative effect on chondrocyte development, which was mediated by the inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation and promotion of chondrocyte apoptosis.
Nitric oxide (NO)-releasing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to have a safer profile and additional anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory properties compared to parent compounds. Preventive treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide 35-55-with the NO-releasing derivative of flurbiprofen HCT1026 delayed disease onset and significantly decreased disease severity. HCT1026 treatment was associated to (i) decreased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, caspase-1, and iNOS in blood cells; (ii) decreased ability of encephalitogenic T cells to proliferate; (iii) reduced number of central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating T cells; (iv) decreased axonal loss and demyelination; (v) increased CD4(+) CD69(-) CD25(+) regulatory T cells in the spleen.
The effect of protection of dopaminergic neurons by talipexole, a dopamine (DA) agonist, is investigated on a methamphetamine (MA)-induced parkinsonism model of mice (C57BL/6N). The reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the striatum 72 h after MA (5 mg/kg every 2 h, four times) treatment was attenuated by the administration of talipexole (0.25 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg) prior to the administration of MA. In an in vitro experiment, talipexole inhibited the adduction reaction of hydroxyl radicals to salicylate. Taken together, these data suggest that the protective effect of talipexole on DA neurons is, in part, caused by the hydroxyl radical-scavenging action of the drug.
In allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), donor T cell-mediated graft versus host leukemia (GVL) and graft versus autoimmune (GVA) activity play critical roles in treatment of hematological malignancies and refractory autoimmune diseases. However, graft versus host disease (GVHD), which sometimes can be fatal, remains a major obstacle in classical HCT, where recipients are conditioned with total body irradiation or high-dose chemotherapy. We previously reported that anti-CD3 conditioning allows donor CD8(+) T cells to facilitate engraftment and mediate GVL without causing GVHD. However, the clinical application of this radiation-free and GVHD preventative conditioning regimen is hindered by the cytokine storm syndrome triggered by anti-CD3 and the high-dose donor bone marrow (BM) cells required for induction of chimerism. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) are known to induce apoptosis of cancer cells and reduce production of proinflammatory cytokines by nonmalignant cells. Here, we report that SAHA inhibits the proliferative and cytotoxic activity of anti-CD3-activated T cells. Administration of low-dose SAHA reduces cytokine production and ameliorates the cytokine storm syndrome triggered by anti-CD3. Conditioning with anti-CD3 and SAHA allows induction of chimerism with lower doses of donor BM cells in old nonautoimmune and autoimmune lupus mice. In addition, conditioning with anti-CD3 and SAHA allows donor CD8(+) T cell-mediated GVA activity to reverse lupus glomerulonephritis without causing GVHD. These results indicate that conditioning with anti-CD3 and HDAC inhibitors represent a radiation-free and GVHD-preventative regimen with clinical application potential.
The effect of adenosine agonist pretreatment on the seizure activity of caffeine was investigated in NIH Swiss mice. The seizure ED50 of caffeine alone was determined to be 223 mg/kg and this was reduced to 68 mg/kg following pretreatment with 0.30 mg/kg N-ethyl carboxamidoadenosine (NECA). Additionally, NECA dose-dependently increased the seizure potency of 100 mg/kg caffeine (a dose which is normally subconvulsant). A proconvulsant effect of NECA was also detected following intracerebroventricular administration of 2.5 ug NECA, however the same doses of N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) and 2-chloroadenosine (2 C1-ADO) did not precipitate seizures. The data reveal proconvulsant actions of both peripherally and centrally administered NECA towards caffeine-induced seizures. Such actions need to be reconciled with the general anticonvulsant action of adenosine and adenosine agonists.
Over the last three years, there have been over twenty case reports of lymphoma in patients given low-dose methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. We observed the first case of cutaneous pseudolymphoma.
A 56-year-old man had been treated with methotrexate (15 mg/day) for 6 years due to rheumatoid arthritis. He developed three isolated papulonodular ulcerations on the limbs. The histology and immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated T and B lymphoplasmocyte infiltration without epidermotropism nor destruction of the annexes. Immunolabelling for anti-Epstein-Barr virus was negative. There was a IgG lambda type monoclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia, Bence-Jones proteinuria and an increase in beta 2-microglobulin. The thoracoabdominal scan, bone marrow biopsy and gallium scintigraphy were normal. There was no sign of a Gougerot-Sjögren syndrome nor of a Felty syndrome. The skin lesions and the Bence-Jones proteinuria disappeared rapidly after withdrawal of methotrexate. There has been no recurrence with a follow-up of 16 months.
The diagnosis of pseudolymphoma was retained on the basis of the clinical features, the histological and immunohistochemical evidence and especially on the clinical course after methotrexate withdrawal, i.e. spontaneous regression of the lesions within 3 weeks. A similar course has been observed in three cases of lymphocyte proliferation suggesting that this immunosuppressor would be the most probable causative agent. Lymphocyte proliferation, mainly B-cell lymphomas in haematopoietic organs occurring under methotrexate administration have occurred mainly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Three cases have also been described in patients with dermatomyositis, but none have been reported in patients with psoriasis. This would suggest that cofactors involved in these autoimmune diseases could also have an effect: immunodepression, potentialization due to associated treatment (corticosteroids), Epstein-Barr virus...
Data on these observations should be combined in order to analyse the question of the safety of low-dose methotrexate in these patients.
The nerve agent soman, as well as other organophosphates such as paraoxon and phospholine in concentrations that caused cholinergic symptoms induced a progressive dose-related necrosis in rat skeletal muscle fibers. The severity of the myopathy depended on a critical decrease in activity and duration of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. The number of muscle fibers affected was greatest with soman, followed by tertiary phospholine, paraxon , and quaternary phospholine. The necrotic nerve fibers were repaired within 1 week. Atropine and gentamycin in concentrations that do not block neuromuscular transmission, attenuate the necrotic action of the organophosphates by interacting with the presynaptic Ca2+ uptake mechanism. The half-time recovery rate of AChE after exposure to soman varied between 12 hr for sciatic nerve, 5-9 days for muscle, and 14 days for brain. AChE activity of peripheral nerve was minimally inhibited by soman and had recovered to control activity within 24 hr. The reason for this apparent insensitivity of the nerve AChE to soman may be due to the high activity of an enzyme that hydrolyzes soman. AChE at the neuromuscular junction in part has a protective and regulatory function through its control of free acetylcholine (ACh). By limiting the accumulation of ACh and the extent of its interaction with pre- and postsynaptic membranes, the morphological integrity of nerve terminals and muscle is preserved.
This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of benzbromarone compared to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid level in hyperuricemic patients with normal renal function (serum creatinine < or = 1.5). The authors conducted a crossover study consisting of two four-week treatment periods of allopurinol 300 mg/day and benzbromarone 100 mg/day separated by a four-week washout period. Fourteen patients with mean age and duration of hyperuricemia of 60.78 +/- 8.62 and 6.93 +/- 3.69 years, respectively, were recruited and all completed our study protocol. This study was a crossover design consisting of two four-week treatments of allopurinol and benzbromarone separated by a four-week washout period. The serum uric acid level was reduced from 9.89 +/- 1.43 mg/dl to 5.52 +/- 0.83 mg/dl and from 9.53 +/- 1.48 to 4.05 +/- 0.87 mg/dl by allopurinol and benzbromarone, respectively. The efficacy of benzbromarone in lowering serum uric acid level was significantly superior to allopurinol (p=0.005). No patient reported clinical side effects during treatment with either drug. In conclusion, the authors have shown that benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol in the reduction of serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic patients with normal renal function.
Previous studies have shown that human bladder cells (UROtsa), a target of arsenic-induced cancer, can biotransform arsenite to monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)), which is more cytotoxic and capable of transforming the UROtsa cells following long-term, low-level exposure. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) causes hyperplasia in bladder cells and is considered a key biomarker in bladder cancer. To investigate the role of mitogenic pathway stimulation in MMA(III)-induced transformation, UROtsa cells were treated with 50nM MMA(III) for 12, 24, or 52 weeks and analyzed by Western blot for COX-2 expression. Elevations in COX-2 expression were noted following chronic MMA(III) exposure, and this induction increased with duration of exposure, suggesting that COX-2 or the signal transduction pathways responsible for COX-2 protein expression may play a role in MMA(III)-induced transformation. Acute exposure studies found MMA(III) treatment (10, 50, and 100nM, 4 h) induced COX-2 in UROtsa cells with the lowest doses (10 and 50nM) causing the strongest induction. Using pharmacological inhibitors of various pathways, it was shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK-1/-2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and src were important in the induction of COX-2 by MMA(III). ERK-2 phosphorylation was verified by Western blot analysis with a peak at 15 min, and c-jun was translocated to the nucleus following 50nM MMA(III) treatment. To determine MMA(III) targets, receptors of the erythroblastosis oncogene family (ErbB) family were further investigated. Chronic MMA(III) exposure led to upregulation of the EGFR or ErbB1. Short-term MMA(III) treatment caused the phosphorylation of ErbB2 in its autophosphorylation site. To verify the importance of these signaling pathways to the growth of the MMA(III)-transformed UROtsa cells in soft agar, various inhibitors were used to block pathways and monitor cells growth. Pathways of importance in anchorage-independent growth of UROtsa cells chronically exposed to MMA(III) are src, PI3K, and COX-1 and -2. As COX-2 is an important mediator that contributes to carcinogenesis via promotion of cell proliferation, inhibition of cell death, induction of angiogenesis, and facilitation of invasion, and it is highly upregulated both acutely and chronically in the MMA(III)-transformed cells, it is likely that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and increased COX-2 expression is a plausible mechanism for MMA(III) bladder carcinogenesis.
Fescue toxicosis affects wild and domestic animals consuming ergot alkaloids contained in tall fescue forage infected with the endophytic fungus, Neotyphodium coenophialum. When animals are consuming infected fescue (E+) forage during periods of elevated ambient temperatures (summer), a range of phenotypic disorders collectively called summer slump is observed. It is characterized by hyperthermia, with an accompanying decrease in feed intake, growth, milk yield, and reproductive fitness. Laboratory mice also exhibit symptoms of fescue toxicosis at thermoneutral (TN) temperature, as indicated by reduced growth rate and reproductive fitness. Our goal was to characterize the differences in gene expression in liver of mice exposed to summer-type heat stress (HS) and E+ when compared to mice fed E+ at TN temperature. Mice were fed E+ diet under HS (34 +/- 1 degrees C; n = 13; E+HS) or TN conditions (24 +/- 1 degrees C; n = 14; E+TN) for a period of 2 weeks between 47 and 60 days of age. Genes differentially expressed between E+HS versus E+TN were identified using DNA microarrays. Forty-one genes were differentially expressed between treatment groups. Expressions of eight genes were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Genes coding for phase I detoxification enzymes were upregulated in E+HS mouse liver. This detoxification pathway is known to produce reactive oxidative species. We observed an upregulation of genes involved in the protection against reactive oxidative species. Key genes involved in de novo lipogenesis and lipid transport were also upregulated. Finally, genes involved in DNA damage control and unfolded protein responses were downregulated.
Urethane is an established animal carcinogen and has been classified as "reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen." Until recently, urethane metabolism via esterase was considered the main metabolic pathway of this chemical. However, recent studies in this laboratory showed that CYP2E1, and not esterase, is the primary enzyme responsible for urethane oxidation. Subsequent studies demonstrated significant inhibition of urethane-induced genotoxicity and cell proliferation in Cyp2e1-/- compared to Cyp2e1+/+ mice. Using Cyp2e1-/- mice, current studies were undertaken to assess the relationships between urethane metabolism and carcinogenicity. Urethane was administered via gavage at 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day, 5 days/week, for 6 weeks. Animals were kept without chemical administration for 7 months after which they were euthanized, and urethane carcinogenicity was assessed. Microscopic examination showed a significant reduction in the incidences of liver hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in Cyp2e1-/- compared to Cyp2e+/+ mice. Lung nodules increased in a dose-dependent manner and were less prevalent in Cyp2e1-/- compared to Cyp2e+/+ mice. Microscopic alterations included bronchoalveolar adenomas, and in one Cyp2e1+/+ mouse treated with 100 mg/kg urethane, a bronchoalveolar carcinoma was diagnosed. Significant reduction in the incidence of adenomas and the number of adenomas/lung were observed in Cyp2e1-/- compared to Cyp2e1+/+ mice. In the Harderian gland, the incidences of hyperplasia and adenomas were significantly lower in Cyp2e1-/- compared to Cyp2e+/+ mice at the 10 mg/kg dose, with no significant differences observed at the high or low doses. In conclusion, this work demonstrated a significant reduction of urethane-induced carcinogenicity in Cyp2e1-/- compared to Cyp2e1+/+ mice and proved that CYP2E1-mediated oxidation plays an essential role in urethane-induced carcinogenicity.
Cyclophosphamide (CTX) and ifosfamide (IFX) are alkylating agents used to treat osteosarcoma (OS). It was previously demonstrated that the sensitivity of OS cells to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC, the active metabolite of CTX) is augmented by interleukin (IL)-12 in vitro through a mechanism involving the Fas/FasL pathway. The purpose of these studies was to determine whether this synergistic effect is operational in vivo.
Mice were injected intravenously with human LM7 osteosarcoma cells. Treatment was initiated with IFX (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) with or without intranasal polyethylenimine (PEI):IL-12 gene therapy given twice weekly for 6 weeks.
Expression of IL-12 protein in the lung was demonstrated in all mice receiving intranasal PEI:IL-12 but not in control mice or those treated with IFX alone. Increased expression of FasL was detected in lungs of all mice receiving IFX. Both IFX and PEI:IL-12 alone significantly inhibited lung metastasis when compared with control groups (P < 0.05). However, the most significant tumor effect was observed in mice receiving IFX+PEI:IL-12 (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical staining for CD31 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and the number of proliferating cells as quantified by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining were also most significantly decreased in mice receiving combination therapy.
These data indicate that combining IFX and IL-12 may have therapeutic potential and that this increased efficacy may be mediated through a mechanism involving the Fas/FasL pathway.
The side effects of opioids have been widely investigated, but it is unknown whether the subjective effects of mu agonists and mixed action opioids produce similar symptom profiles. This study examined the structure and predictive validity of somatic and cognitive/affective side-effect profiles of morphine and pentazocine using the Somatic Side Effects Questionnaire and the Cognitive and Affective Side Effects Questionnaire.
The subjects were 122 female and 90 male healthy volunteers that received an intravenous bolus administration of either 0.08 mg/kg of morphine or 0.5 mg/kg pentazocine. Pre- and post-drug experimental pain testing was also performed. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis resulted in similar factor structures for both drugs.
The most frequently reported side effects across both drugs involved feeling relaxed, sedation, and feeling in control. At equianalgesic doses, pentazocine had greater aversive side effects than morphine, whereas morphine was more associated with feelings of control and euphoria. For both drugs, females reported greater frequency of negative side effects than males. Using cluster analysis, we identified similar symptom profiles for each drug. These drug-related side-effect profiles were linked with analgesic responses. Specifically, groups that had a more positive side-effect profile experienced the greatest analgesic effect based on changes in ischemic pain sensitivity.
These findings have implications for decisions regarding opioid management of acute, chronic, and malignant pain conditions.
Administration of aluminum sulfate in the drinking water of male Sprague-Dawley rats for thirty days resulted in an impairment of both consolidation and extinction of a passive avoidance task. No impairment of performance was observed on an active avoidance task, radial arm maze or open field activity measure. Biochemical analysis indicated a slight (less than 10%) but significant increase in hippocampal muscarinic receptor number after aluminum treatment as determined by tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB) binding. No changes were found in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, 3H-QNB binding in the cortex or tritiated pirenzepine (3H-PZ) binding in the hippocampus or cortex. These results indicate that cholinergic degeneration was not the cause of the observed cognitive impairments.
Cytokine mRNA levels were measured in serial splenic aspirates from 27 patients with visceral leishmaniasis during monotherapy with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma; n = 9), sodium antimony gluconate (SAG; n = 8), or amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC; n = 10). At baseline, mRNA for IFN-gamma was detected in 18 (86%) of 21 patients, and mRNA for interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4 was detected in 21 (100%) and 10 (48%) of 21 patients, respectively. With IFN-gamma treatment alone, levels of IFN-gamma mRNA decreased by day 10 and then returned to baseline levels; IL-10 mRNA levels were high throughout treatment. In the SAG and ABLC groups, levels of IFN-gamma and IL-10 mRNA decreased significantly. Polarized Th2 cell type responses do not appear to develop in Indian kala-azar; instead, there is an initial mixed Th1-Th2 cell picture. With successful treatment and resolution of infection, both components of the immune response appear to involute.
In this study we used liver mitochondrial and microsomal fraction from rats pretreated with seaweed Ulva lactuca polysaccharide extract (ULP - 200mg/kg body weight, daily for 21 days, oral gavage) on D-Galactosamine (500mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) challenge. Effectiveness of ULP was determined based on functional status of trichloro acetic acid (TCA), urea cycle, and microsomal enzymes. The composition of sulfate polysaccharide content such as total sugars, sulfate and uronic acid were examined. In addition the fine ultra structural changes were examined using electron microscopy (EM). We observed significant (p<0.001) mitochondrial and microsomal abnormalities during liver damage by D-Galactosamine, consequently altering enzymes of energy metabolism. Electron microscopy of D-Galactosamine intoxicated rat liver tissue revealed the swelling and loss of mitochondrial cristae. Conversely the rats pretreated with ULP against D-Galactosamine challenge prevented (p<0.05) the significant abnormality of TCA, microsomal enzymes and severity of mitochondria as observed in EM study in rats injected with D-Galactosamine alone. However no effective prevention was observed in urea cycle enzymes among D-Galactosamine and treatment group rats. These results showed the effectiveness of ULP in stabilizing the functional status of mitochondrial and microsomal membrane which might be due to the presence of sulfated polysaccharide that could prevented the oxidative stress induced by D-Galactosamine intoxication.
Arterial emboli are largely a reflection of cardiac disease. Thalidomide is an antiangiogenic drug used in cancer therapy. Venous thrombosis incidence increased during treatment with thalidomide. We reported arterial thrombosis in two cases with multiple myeloma implemented in thalidomide treatment. Standard emergency intervention was applied. In the postoperative period, enoxiparine was given to all the patients. Warfarin treatment was started in the level of INR 2-2,5. ASA with a dose of 100 mg/day was added to the treatment. In conclusion, this side effect of the use of thalidomide should be taken into consideration while doing examinations with respect to the etiology in arterial thromboembolism and because of this vascular complication that threatens life; we suggest stopping the thalidomide treatment.
After smoking "crack," the free-base form of cocaine, a 27-year-old man suffered an infarction of most of the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Concomitant drug use seemed to have been limited to ethanol and ibuprofen. Search for other possible causes was negative. Angiography revealed narrowing of the supraclinoid portion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and cutoff of at least two distal branches. There was no beading or irregularity to suggest vasculitis. Crack may have induced vasospasm in the ICA through recognized sympathomimetic actions of cocaine.
Using a randomised double-blind crossover design with Latin square allocation of treatments in 20 subjects (7 male, 13 female-ages: 61-87 years) with systolic hypertension, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of once daily felodipine (extended release) 5-20 mg, enalapril 5-20 mg and their combination compared with placebo in four treatment phases each of 6 weeks duration. During each phase, doses were titrated to achieve a predose clinic supine systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or to a predetermined maximum dose. In both the felodipine and combination phases, predose supine and standing systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly reduced compared with the placebo phase (decrease in supine pressure: -13/-5 and -18/-7, respectively). Only predose supine diastolic pressure was significantly reduced (-3 mmHg) compared to placebo in the enalapril phase. In combination the effects of the two drugs on predose blood pressure were additive. There was a 40-60% increase in reported symptoms in the felodipine and combination phases compared with the placebo and enalapril phases. Thus, in elderly subjects with systolic hypertension, felodipine effectively reduces blood pressure throughout the dose interval but with vasodilator adverse effects. In contrast, enalapril is well tolerated but is less effective in reducing blood pressure throughout the whole dose interval.
Androgens, while essential for prostate gland development, have been postulated to contribute to carcinogenesis, and antioxidants have been postulated to suppress prostate cancer development. We theorized that antioxidants might suppress prostate cancer cell growth by blocking androgen effects on cell survival. This hypothesis was tested by in vitro studies conducted in ALVA-101, an androgen responsive human prostate cancer cell line.
ALVA-101 was cultured with or without testosterone (T, 10(-12) M) and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC, 10 microg/mL). Cell Titer 96 AQ, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Northern and Western blot were used to quantify the cell growth, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity, mRNAs of survivin, Bcl-2, androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA), and proteins of AR and survivin.
PDTC suppressed EMSA of NF-kappaB and significantly decreased (p < 0.05) T's stimulatory effects on cell growth, mRNAs of survivin, Bcl-2, AR and PSA and synthesis of proteins of AR and survivin. Antisense to both survivin and Bcl-2 suppressed cell growth.
PDTC, a potent inducer of apoptosis, exerts antiandrogen-like action by reducing AR protein and reversing the stimulatory effects of androgen on potent inhibitors of apoptosis.
The effects of minocycline on behavioral changes and neurotoxicity in the dopaminergic neurons induced by the administration of methamphetamine (METH) were studied. Pretreatment with minocycline (40 mg/kg) was found to attenuate hyperlocomotion in mice after a single administration of METH (3 mg/kg). The development of behavioral sensitization after repeated administration of METH (3 mg/kg/day, once daily for 5 days) was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with minocycline (40 mg/kg). A reduction in the level of dopamine (DA) and its major metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), in the striatum after the repeated administration of METH (3 mg/kg x 3, 3-h interval) was attenuated in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment with and the subsequent administration of minocycline (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg). Furthermore, minocycline (40 mg/kg) significantly attenuated a reduction in DA transporter (DAT)-immunoreactivity in the striatum after repeated administration of METH. In vivo microdialysis study demonstrated that pretreatment with minocycline (40 mg/kg) significantly attenuated increased extracellular DA levels in the striatum after the administration of METH (3 mg/kg). In addition, minocycline was not found to alter the concentrations of METH in the plasma or the brain after three injections of METH (3 mg/kg), suggesting that minocycline does not alter the pharmacokinetics of METH in mice. Interestingly, METH-induced neurotoxicity in the striatum was significantly attenuated by the post-treatment and subsequent administration of minocycline (40 mg/kg). These findings suggest that minocycline may be able to ameliorate behavioral changes as well as neurotoxicity in dopaminergic terminals after the administration of METH. Therefore, minocycline could be considered as a useful drug for the treatment of several symptoms associated with METH abuse in humans.
