A 36-year-old male patient was scheduled to undergo ureteroscopic lithotomy because of left ureteral stone under spinal anesthesia. After receiving a renewed spinal anesthesia with 8 mg tetracaine to compensate for the first attempt (with 10 mg tetracaine), which proved to be a failure, he was soon seized with episodic seizure attacks. Central nervous system toxicity of the local anesthetic might be the cause of the seizure. We brought forward this case for discussion for warning that the possibility of systemic toxicity of local anesthetic might exist despite a seemingly undisputable spinal anesthesia.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) are proposed mediators of cytokine-induced beta-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes. We produced transgenic mice with increased beta-cell expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase. Expression of these antioxidants increased beta-cell ROS scavenging and improved beta-cell survival after treatment with different sources of ROS. MnSOD or catalase conferred protection against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced beta-cell injury. Coexpression of MnSOD and catalase provided synergistic protection against peroxynitrite and STZ. To determine the potential effect of these antioxidants on cytokine-induced toxicity, we exposed isolated islets to a cytokine mixture, including interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma. Cytokine toxicity was measured as reduced metabolic activity after 6 days and reduced insulin secretion after 1 day. Cytokines increased ROS production, and both antioxidants were effective in reducing cytokine-induced ROS. However, MnSOD and/or catalase provided no protection against cytokine-induced injury. To understand this, the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling cascade was investigated. Antioxidants reduced NF-kappaB activation by ROS, but none of the antioxidants altered activation by cytokines, as measured by inhibitor of kappaB phosphorylation, NF-kappaB translocation, inducible NO synthase activation, and NO production. Our data agree with previous reports that antioxidants benefit beta-cell survival against ROS damage, but they are not consistent with reports that antioxidants reduce cytokine toxicity. ROS appear to have no role in cytokine toxicity in primary beta-cells.
Twenty-three 50-year-old men with untreated, essential hypertension had elevated plasma concentrations of the platelet release product beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) compared to 14 age-matched control men (p less than 0.01). BTG correlated with arterial plasma adrenaline concentrations in the hypertensive (r = 0.44, p less than 0.05), normotensive (r = 0.73, p less than 0.01) and combined group (r = 0.51, p less than 0.01). Significant correlations (p less than 0.05) between BTG and cholesterol (LDL + VLDL fraction) were observed both in the hypertensive and the normotensive group. In the hypertensive group arterial adrenaline correlated with cholesterol (LDL + VLDL) (p less than 0.05). These findings are consistent with increased platelet activity in middle-aged men with essential hypertension, and may indicate that plasma adrenaline influence platelet function. The risk factors for coronary artery disease (blood pressure, lipid status, stress as evidenced by catecholamine release and platelet function) were positively related. Measurement of arterial instead of venous adrenaline is essential for the demonstration of the associations presented.
The anticonvulsant potential of 6-chloro-2-(ethylamino)-4-methyl-4-phenyl-4H-3,1-benzoxazine (etifoxine), a non-benzodiazepine tranquilizer, was evaluated in mice in comparison to valproate, phenytoin and clobazam. Maximal seizures were induced by electroshock (MES) and the chemical convulsants pentetrazol (PTZ), picrotoxin (PTX), bicuculline (BIC), isoniazid (INH), nicotine (NIC) and strychnine (STR). Tonic extensor convulsions were prevented by etifoxine in the following rank order of potency (ED50 values with seizure tests): 39.5 (PTX), 101 (PTZ), 101 (MES), 154 (INH), 181 (NIC), 397 (BIC), and greater than 800 mg/kg p.o. (STR). Clonic seizures were induced by threshold doses of PTZ, PTX and pilocarpine (PIL) and antagonized by etifoxine at ED50 values of 181 (PIL), 221 (PTZ), and greater than 800 mg/kg p.o. (PTX). Hence, etifoxine blocked both tonic and clonic seizures but was more potent against the tonic component. The anticonvulsant profile of etifoxine appeared similar to that of valproate. However, in terms of potency, protective indices (ED50 rotarod/ED50 seizure test) and therapeutic indices (LD50/ED50 seizure test) etifoxine was on an average 3.7, 12 and 14 times superior to valproate, respectively. It is concluded that etifoxine has a marked anticonvulsive potential and may be beneficially used in epileptic disorders, especially of the grand mal type.
Thirty-seven evaluable patients with progressive disseminated breast carcinoma were treated with a combination of mitoxantrone 14 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks plus prednisone 20 mg/m2 p.o. daily with a reducing dose over several weeks. Thirteen of 37 patients (35%) achieved an objective response with two complete regressions. The median duration of response was 7 months and the median duration of survival 14 months. The cardiac function of all patients was monitored by serial left ventricular ejection fraction, at rest and after stress, and 3-monthly thereafter. Ten patients showed a deterioration in the ejection fraction after a minimum cumulative dose of 86 mg/m2 (six cycles), but only four developed clinical cardiac failure which was easily reversible after stopping mitoxantrone. Leucopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. Nausea and/or vomiting were generally mild and transient. Alopecia was minimal. These results confirmed that this combination is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of disseminated breast carcinoma, and cardiotoxicity can be avoided with adequate monitoring of the left ventricular ejection fraction after six cycles of therapy (86 mg/m2).
We report a case of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder after cyclophosphamide therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Urologic evaluation and histologic confirmation occurred only after low grade tumor cells were identified in multiple urine samples. Malignant cells can be distinguished from drug effect in urinary specimens from patients treated with cyclophosphamide and all such cases should include regular cytologic evaluations.
Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a potentially fatal form of ventricular arrhythmia that occurs under conditions where cardiac repolarization is delayed (as indicated by prolonged QT intervals from electrocardiographic recordings). A likely mechanism for QT prolongation and TdP is blockade of the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr)), which is encoded by HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene). The gastroprokinetic agent cisapride is a potent blocker of HERG currents and serious cardiac arrhythmias and deaths from TdP and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in patients taking cisapride. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of the gastroprokinetic agents domperidone and metoclopramide on HERG channels transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Both domperidone and metoclopramide concentration-dependently blocked HERG currents, and the following values were calculated for IC(50) (the concentrations causing half-maximal inhibition) and n (the Hill coefficient): 57.0 nmol/l and 0.99 for domperidone, 5.4 micromol/l and 0.95 for metoclopramide. The observation that the extent of block of HERG currents by domperidone increased at more positive membrane potentials whereas block of HERG currents by metoclopramide displayed a smaller degree of voltage dependency seems to indicate that domperidone and metoclopramide have distinct binding sites on HERG channels. In conclusion, the potency for block of HERG currents is about 100-fold lower for metoclopramide when compared to domperidone.
Pre-neoplastic lesions in rodent liver often express high levels of MDM2 and lack a p53 response to DNA damage. The question we posed was whether there is a liver-specific regulation of the p53/MDM2 feedback loop and if it can be related to the development of pre-neoplastic lesions, referred to as enzyme altered foci (EAF) in rats. Acute responses of p53 and MDM2 to diethylnitrosamine (DEN) were characterized by employing immunohistochemistry, western blotting, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. A single dose of DEN induced a centrilobular p53 response that peaked at 24 h. It was associated with transcriptional activation of MDM2 and signs of apoptosis. However, in midzonal hepatocytes, which constitutively expressed high levels of cytoplasmic MDM2, there was a rapid-onset but transient p53 response. It was terminated at 24 h and there were no signs of apoptosis. The rapidly declining p53 levels in midzonal areas was preceded by a transient peak in MDM2 mRNA levels at 6 h. Rats pre-treated with repeated low or high weekly doses of DEN exhibited EAF and these lesions expressed high levels of cytoplasmic MDM2. Using MDM2 as a marker for EAF gave similar results as using glutathione transferase-P (GST-P) as a marker. Furthermore, small EAF, elicited by low doses of DEN, were preferentially localized to midzonal areas. It is concluded that in centrilobular areas DEN-induced alterations in p53/MDM2 levels are compatible with a previously described feedback loop. An attenuated p53 response in midzonal hepatocytes can be related to a high constitutive expression of MDM2 in these cells. The localization of small EAF to midzonal areas, and the fact that EAF cells expressed high levels of MDM2, indicates that MDM2 expression is a factor governing initiation and early development of EAF. The data support the hypothesis that EAF hepatocytes are initiated via epigenetic mechanisms.
Fatty acid desaturases such as steaoryl-CoA desaturase (SCD) convert saturated to unsaturated fatty acids and are involved in lipogenesis. Observational and animal data suggest that SCD-1 activity is related to insulin sensitivity. However, the effects of insulin-sensitizing drugs on SCD gene expression and desaturase activities are unknown in humans. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study, 24 subjects with type 2 diabetes and one subject with partial lipodystrophy and diabetes due to dominant-negative mutation in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) gene (P467L) received placebo and rosiglitazone for 3 months. SCD gene expression in adipose tissue was determined in 23 subjects, and in a representative subgroup (n = 10) we assessed fatty acid composition in fasting plasma triglycerides to estimate SCD and delta6- and delta5-desaturase activity, using product-to-precursor indexes. SCD mRNA expression increased by 48% after rosiglitazone (P < 0.01). SCD and delta5-desaturase but not delta6-desaturase activity indexes were increased after rosiglitazone versus placebo (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). The change in activity index but not the expression of SCD was associated with improved insulin sensitivity (r = 0.73, P < 0.05). In the P467L PPARgamma carrier, SCD and delta5-desaturase activity indexes were exceptionally low but were restored (52- and 15-fold increases, respectively) after rosiglitazone treatment. This study shows for the first time that rosiglitazone increases SCD activity indexes and gene expression in humans. An increased SCD activity index may reflect increased lipogenesis and might contribute to insulin sensitization by rosiglitazone. The restored SCD activity index after rosiglitazone in PPARgamma mutation supports a pivotal role of PPARgamma function in SCD regulation.
The circadian timing system rhythmically controls behavior, physiology, cellular proliferation and xenobiotic metabolism over the 24-h period. The suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus coordinate the molecular clocks in most mammalian cells through an array of circadian physiological rhythms including rest-activity, body temperature, feeding patterns and hormonal secretions. As a result, shift work that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic in humans. In experimental models, chronic jet-lag (CJL) suppresses rest-activity and body temperature rhythms and accelerates growth of two transplantable tumors in mice. CJL also suppresses or significantly alters the expression rhythms of clock genes in liver and tumors. Circadian clock disruption from CJL downregulates p53 and upregulates c-Myc, thus favoring cellular proliferation. Here, we investigate the role of CJL as a tumor promoter in mice exposed to the hepatic carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN).
In experiment 1 (Exp 1), the dose-dependent carcinogenicity of chronic intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of DEN was explored in mice. In Exp 2, mice received DEN at 10 mg/kg/day (cumulative dose: 243 mg/kg), then were randomized to remain in a photoperiodic regimen where 12 h of light alternates with 12 h of darkness (LD 12:12) or to be submitted to CJL (8-h advance of light onset every 2 days). Rest-activity and body temperature were monitored. Serum liver enzymes were determined repeatedly. Mice were sacrificed and examined for neoplastic lesions at 10 months.
In Exp 1, DEN produced liver cancers in all the mice receiving 10 mg/kg/day. In Exp 2, mice on CJL had increased mean plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase and more liver tumors as compared to LD mice at approximately 10 months (p = 0.005 and 0.028, respectively). The mean diameter of the largest liver tumor was twice as large in CJL vs LD mice (8.5 vs 4.4 mm, p = 0.027). In LD, a single histologic tumor type per liver was observed. In CJL, up to four different types were associated in the same liver (hepatocellular- or cholangio-carcinomas, sarcomas or mixed tumors). DEN itself markedly disrupted the circadian rhythms in rest-activity and body temperature in all the mice. DEN-induced disruption was prolonged for >or= 3 months by CJL exposure.
The association of circadian disruption with chronic DEN exposure suggests that circadian clocks actively control the mechanisms of liver carcinogenesis in mice. Persistent circadian coordination may further be critical for slowing down and/or reverting cancer development after carcinogen exposure.
Carboplatin is a well-established chemotherapeutic agent used to treat a variety of pediatric malignancies. Platinum analogues such as cisplatin are known to be ototoxic, but little is known regarding the ototoxicity of carboplatin. We performed a single institution retrospective chart review of pediatric oncology patients who received platinum-containing regimens from 1993 to 2002. Ninety-nine patients with sufficient medical and audiologic data were identified. Significant hearing loss was defined as a Brock grade 1 or higher. The incidence was compared among 3 treatment groups (carboplatin only, carboplatin and cisplatin, and cisplatin only). Significant hearing loss in patients receiving carboplatin only was rare, observed in only 1/25 (4%) of patients. In contrast, 19/27 (70%) of patients receiving carboplatin and cisplatin possessed significant hearing loss, as did 27/47 (57%) of those patients receiving cisplatin only P<0.001. The difference in hearing loss could not be explained by different cumulative exposures of the platinum agents. Carboplatin, when used without cisplatin, is rarely associated with severe hearing loss, even at high cumulative doses.
We conducted a single-bind placebo controlled study using 24-hour continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings. The arrhythmogenic potential of the combination of salbutamol and theophylline was investigated in 25 ambulatory subjects with severe chronic airflow obstruction (mean age 65 +/- 8 SD, mean FEV1 31 percent +/- 13 SD predicted). Asymptomatic arrhythmias were very prevalent in the study population: 76 percent of the patients had runs of supraventricular tachycardia while 24 percent had runs of ventricular tachycardia. Individual arrhythmia frequency showed greater between-test variability than previously described in non-COPD subjects. The mode of administration of salbutamol may have affected arrhythmia frequency in that subjects using aerosol nebulizers had more ventricular extrasystoles than those using metered dose inhalers. Although the addition of theophylline to salbutamol significantly increased heart rate and supraventricular extrasystoles, there was no statistically significant increase in ventricular arrhythmias.
We report a patient with tuberculosis treated with a five-drug regimen who experienced severe acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities including hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. These disturbances are believed to be due to treatment with capreomycin, which produced renal magnesium wasting and possible tubular damage. Therefore, we recommend frequent determinations of serum electrolytes, magnesium, and calcium in patients treated with capreomycin.
Three male patients aged 52, 49 and 74 years who were treated with hydroxyurea for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) or essential thrombocytosis developed severely painful ulcers on the lower legs and feet after an interval varying from 4 months to 2.5 years. These ulcers only healed after discontinuation of the drug. This is an adverse effect of hydroxyurea that is not infrequently seen but is difficult to recognise. The precise pathogenesis is still unclear but micro-circulatory disorders and a direct cytostatic effect on the epidermal cells probably play a role. Often, the drug has already been used for several years before the ulcers develop. They are resistant to treatment unless the hydroxyurea is stopped. Alternatives to hydroxyurea are imatinib for the treatment of CML and interferon alpha-2a or anagrelide for essential thrombocytosis.
Life-threatening and fatal hyponatraemic complications following ecstasy use have previously been documented.
To define clinical features of hyponatraemia following the ingestion of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy').
Retrospective case series.
All enquiries to the London centre of the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) between December 1993 and March 1996 were screened for cases of MDMA use associated with hyponatraemia (serum sodium <130 mmol/l). History of fluid consumption, presenting features and subsequent clinical course were recorded.
Seventeen patients, aged 15-26 years, were identified. Serum sodium levels ranged between 107 mmol/l and 128 mmol/l. In six patients, biochemical results were consistent with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Analytical confirmation of MDMA ingestion was obtained in 10 patients. Ten patients were known to have ingested a large amount of non-alcoholic or alcoholic fluid. The clinical pattern was remarkably uniform, with initial vomiting and disturbed behaviour, followed in 11 patients by seizures. Drowsiness, a mute state and disorientation were observed for up to 3 days. Two patients died; 14 made a complete recovery.
MDMA can cause life-threatening hyponatraemic encephalopathy when accompanied by excessive fluid ingestion. The mechanism involves inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.
We have recently shown that genetic inactivation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma), the isoform linked to G-protein-coupled receptors, results in increased cardiac contractility with no effect on basal cell size. Signaling via the G-protein-coupled beta-adrenergic receptors has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, suggesting that PI3Kgamma might play a role in the pathogenesis of heart disease.
To determine the role for PI3Kgamma in hypertrophy induced by G-protein-coupled receptors and cardiomyopathy, we infused isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, into PI3Kgamma-deficient mice. Compared with controls, isoproterenol infusion in PI3Kgamma-deficient mice resulted in an attenuated cardiac hypertrophic response and markedly reduced interstitial fibrosis. Intriguingly, chronic beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation triggered impaired heart functions in wild-type mice, whereas PI3Kgamma-deficient mice retained their increased heart function and did not develop heart failure. The lack of PI3Kgamma attenuated the activation of Akt/protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes in response to isoproterenol. beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptor densities were decreased by similar amounts in PI3Kgamma-deficient and control mice, suggesting that PI3Kgamma isoform plays no role in the downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors after chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation.
Our data show that PI3Kgamma is critical for the induction of hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction function in response to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation in vivo. Thus, PI3Kgamma may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of decreased cardiac function in heart failure.
The intent of this study was to determine whether altering the metabolism of neurosteroids via blockade of the enzyme, steroid sulfatase, could enhance memory retention in rats. The steroid sulfatase inhibitor p-O-(sulfamoyl)-N-tetradecanoyl tyramine (DU-14) was administered alone and in combination with the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) to rats which were then tested for the reversal of scopolamine-induced amnesia. A single 30 mg/kg IP dose of DU-14 produced a significant inhibition of steroid sulfatase activity in both brain (14.8%), and liver (85.2%) tissues, 24 hours following administration. In a passive avoidance test, DU-14 enhanced the reversal of amnesia by DHEAS. These results suggest that steroid sulfatase inhibition can potentiate the memory enhancing properties of DHEAS.
Gene regulated in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) is a novel estrogen-regulated gene shown to play a pivotal role in hormone-stimulated breast cancer growth. GREB1 is expressed in the prostate and its putative promoter contains potential androgen receptor (AR) response elements.
We investigated the effects of androgens on GREB1 expression and its role in androgen-dependent prostate cancer growth.
Real-time PCR demonstrated high level GREB1 expression in benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), localized prostate cancer (L-PCa), and hormone refractory prostate cancer (HR-PCa). Androgen treatment of AR-positive prostate cancer cells induced dose-dependent GREB1 expression, which was blocked by anti-androgens. AR binding to the GREB1 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Suppression of GREB1 by RNA interference blocked androgen-stimulated LNCaP cell proliferation.
GREB1 is expressed in proliferating prostatic tissue and prostate cancer, is regulated by androgens, and suppression of GREB1 blocks androgen-induced growth suggesting GREB1 may be critically involved in prostate cancer proliferation.
To document a case of anion gap, nonketotic metabolic acidosis occurring in a patient with acute renal failure who was receiving metformin.
A 67-year-old white man presented with a 9-day history of weakness, nausea, dizziness, and difficulty moving; he had also not eaten during the previous 2 days. The patient had numerous abnormalities on his serum chemistry panel and arterial blood gases, including a pH of 7.1 and an anion gap of 21 mEq/L No ketones were detected in the urine. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids, sodium bicarbonate, insulin, and hemodialysis. All medications were discontinued. The acidosis resolved shortly after hemodialysis. The hospital course was complicated by the onset of atrial fibrillation occurring on day 2 that did not respond to chemical cardioversion. On day 6 the patient was discharged home with resolving acute renal failure and normal serum pH.
The mortality rate of biguanide-induced lactic acidosis is approximately 50%; thus, early recognition and treatment are essential. Suspicion of lactic acidosis should be high when diabetic patients who are taking a biguanide present with acidosis. The majority of cases of metformin-induced lactic acidosis have occurred in patients with contraindications to the drug (i.e., renal dysfunction). Thus, it is important to maintain strict adherence to these contraindications and monitor patients for deteriorating renal function.
Previous studies have shown that physiological stimulation of brain activity increases anaerobic glucose consumption, both in humans and in experimental animals. To investigate this phenomenon further, we measured extracellular lactate levels within different rat brain regions, using microdialysis. Experiments were performed comparing the effects of natural, physiological olfactory stimulation of the limbic system with experimental limbic seizures. Olfactory stimulation was carried out by using different odors (i.e. both conventional odors: 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine, green pepper essence; thymol; and 2-sec-butylthiazoline, a sexual pheromone). Limbic seizures were either induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine (200-400 mg/kg) or focally elicited by microinfusions of chemoconvulsants (bicuculline 118 pmol and cychlothiazide 1.2 nmol) within the anterior piriform cortex. Seizures induced by systemic pilocarpine tripled lactic acid within the hippocampus, whereas limbic seizures elicited by focal microinfusion of chemoconvulsants within the piriform cortex produced a less pronounced increase in extracellular lactic acid. Increases in extracellular lactate occurring during olfactory stimulation with the sexual pheromone (three times the baseline levels) were non-significantly different from those occurring after systemic pilocarpine. Increases in lactic acid following natural olfactory stimulation were abolished both by olfactory bulbectomy and by the focal microinfusion of tetrodotoxin, while they were significantly attenuated by the local application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist AP-5. Increases in hippocampal lactate induced by short-lasting stimuli (olfactory stimulation or microinfusion of subthreshold doses of chemoconvulsants, bicuculline 30 pmol) were reproducible after a short delay (1 h) and cumulated when applied sequentially. In contrast, limbic status epilepticus led to a long-lasting refractoriness to additional lactate-raising stimuli and there was no further increase in lactate levels when the olfactory stimulation was produced during status epilepticus. Increases in lactic acid following olfactory stimulation occurred with site specificity in the rhinencephalon (hippocampus, piriform and entorhinal cortex) but not in the dorsal striatum. Site specificity crucially relied on the quality of the stimulus. For instance, other natural stimuli (i.e. tail pinch) produced a similar increase in extracellular lactate in all brain areas under investigation. The major conclusion of this work is that the presentation of an odor known to be a rat pheromone results in lactate production as great as that induced by the systemic convulsant pylocarpine (maximum: 2.286+/-0.195 mM and 1.803+/-0.108 mM, respectively). This supports the notion that the great magnitude of lactate production known to accompany seizures can result from the intensified neural activity per se ("aerobic gycolysis"), not merely from local anoxia or other pathological changes.
Cardiotoxicity is a rare but serious side effect of 5-flourouracil (5-FU). The cardiotoxicity incidence of 5-FU is increasing with its frequent use in chemotherapy protocols. To explain the mechanism of this cardiotoxicity, many theories have been suggested by different authors. Most commonly, coronary artery vasospasm and flouroacetate,a toxic metabolite of 5-FU, are considered responsible for the toxicity. Ischemic symptoms and signs related to 5-FU are observed during the late phase of the administration of the drug. The close and careful monitorization of all the patients, especially the ones with pre-existent coronary artery disease, during 5-FU infusion is mandatory. Because there is not a single and effective modality of treatment or prophylaxis for 5-FU cardiotoxicity, the patients should be selected carefully for 5-FU administration and 5-FU infusion should be stopped as soon as a symptom is encountered.
Refractory peptic ulceration is the term applied to those gastric and duodenal ulcers which remain unhealed despite active treatment for at least 3 months. Sulphydryl-containing agents stimulate the formation of gastrointestinal mucus, bind the oxygen-derived free radicals that mediate tissue damage and play an important role in protein synthesis. This is the first report which suggests that these agents stimulate the healing of refractory gastric and duodenal ulceration without any adverse events.
The effect of metformin or rosiglitazone monotherapy versus placebo on insulin signaling and gene expression in skeletal muscle of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes was determined. A euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, combined with skeletal muscle biopsies and glucose uptake measurements over rested and exercised muscle, was performed before and after 26 weeks of metformin (n = 9), rosiglitazone (n = 10), or placebo (n = 11) treatment. Insulin-mediated whole-body and leg muscle glucose uptake was enhanced 36 and 32%, respectively, after rosiglitazone (P < 0.01) but not after metformin or placebo treatment. Insulin increased insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity, and phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 and AS160, a newly described Akt substrate that plays a role in GLUT4 exocytosis, approximately 2.3 fold before treatment. These insulin signaling parameters were unaltered after metformin, rosiglitazone, or placebo treatment. Expression of selected genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle was unchanged between the treatment groups. Low-intensity acute exercise increased insulin-mediated glucose uptake but was without effect on insulin signaling. In conclusion, the insulin-sensitizing effects of rosiglitazone are independent of enhanced signaling of IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/Akt/AS160 in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
Severe congenital protein C deficiency is a rare life-threatening disorder that presents with purpura fulminans, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thrombotic complications during the neonatal period. Affected children require acute replacement therapy with fresh frozen plasma or protein C concentrate, for example, Ceprotin (Baxter AG, Vienna). Long-term management and outcome is dependent on effective anticoagulation with warfarin, low-molecular weight heparin, or protein C concentrate. We describe the successful use of intravenous protein C concentrate for thrombotic prophylaxis in 2 sisters with severe type I protein C deficiency. Individualized long-term prophylactic regimens were developed based on clinical response. In vivo pharmacokinetic analyses of protein C concentrate were performed in each patient. Analysis of the protein C gene coding sequences identified 2 mutations in both patients, the previously described Arg169 to Trp mutation, and a novel mutation that changes Cys17 into a stop codon.
This prospective, phase II study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of midazolam as a sedative agent in nine critically ill Japanese patients without coma who had been admitted to an intensive care unit. An adequate level of sedation (sedative score [SS] 4-6) was induced by midazolam 0.14 - 0.39 mg/kg and maintained with a dose range of 0.08 - 0.24 mg/kg per h. One patient was excluded from the efficacy analysis since optimum sedation was not maintained by continuous infusion. The percentage of time during which SS 5 was achieved varied among the patients. The most frequent adverse events were hypotension, partial pressure of carbon dioxide elevation and premature ventricular contraction. Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that lower drug clearance rates were correlated with the presence of complications. The 50% of effective concentration values of SS 5, estimated by logistic regression analysis, varied greatly (mean, 251 ng/ml). In conclusion, midazolam infusion achieved successful sedation in this critical care setting. The optimum dose differed among the patients, however, and was influenced by the presence of complications.
This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of midazolam as a sedative agent in 14 critically ill patients without coma admitted to the intensive care unit at Nihon University Itabashi Hospital, Japan. Adequate sedation (sedation score [SS] 4-6) was induced with 0.058- 0.372 mg/ kg midazolam and maintained with a dose range of 0.03-0.4 mg/kg per h. Most burn or trauma patients required higher midazolam doses than patients with cardiovascular disease. The most frequent adverse events observed were hypotension, heart-rate fluctuation and electrocardiogram abnormalities. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the population suggested that lower drug clearance rates correlated with presence of complications. Plasma concentrations (EC50) of SS 5, estimated by logistic regression analysis, varied among patients (mean 194 ng/ml). Midazolam infusion achieved successful sedation in this critical care setting, but the optimum dose differed by patient and was influenced by the presence of complications.
Left ventricular remodeling after an acute myocardial infarction may result in progressive left ventricular dilation that may be associated with increased mortality. We studied the effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone on left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction.
Rats (n = 90) were randomized to undergo either left coronary artery ligation or sham operation. Three weeks after surgery, rats received either no treatment or milrinone, which was continued until 2 days before the rats were killed. Ninety days after the initial surgery, hemodynamic measurements were made before and after volume loading. The rats were killed, the hearts were removed, and passive pressure-volume curves were obtained. The hearts were fixed at a constant pressure and analyzed morphometrically. Compared with untreated infarcted rats, milrinone-treated infarcted rats had a lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (1.7 +/- 0.4 versus 4.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), a lower left ventricular volume (1.25 +/- 0.20 versus 2.37 +/- 0.30 ml/kg, p less than 0.001) and a lower left ventricular wall stress index (1.3 +/- 0.2 versus 1.7 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular chamber stiffness was higher in milrinone-treated infarcted rats than in untreated infarcted rats. Milrinone had no cardiac effect on uninfarcted animals.
Chronic milrinone therapy after acute myocardial infarction improves cardiac hemodynamic indexes and attenuates progressive left ventricular dilation.
To describe the endometrial appearance in postmenopausal breast cancer patients on tamoxifen and to assess a routine surveillance scheme for endometrial lesions.
Three hundred and seventeen postmenopausal breast cancer women already on tamoxifen at the start of the study (group I) and 89 breast cancer women assessed before any tamoxifen intake (group II) underwent an initial and then yearly scans with transvaginal ultrasonography, followed by an hysteroscopy and biopsy for women with an endometrium thickened above 8mm. Endometrial thickness was also measured in 823 women with no breast cancer nor tamoxifen intake (group III).
Initial mean endometrial thickness was 8.2mm in group I, 4.4mm in group II and 3.4mm in group III (P<0.001). Eighteen percent endometrial lesions were found in group I and 3.3% in group II. We observed a significant association between endometrial pathology and both cumulated dose and total duration. Polyps were the most frequent and first to appear pathology. Five cancers were detected in group I, and all of them had taken tamoxifen for more than 3 years.
Our surveillance scheme could be lightened; an acceptable screening scheme might include a baseline assessment before the start of tamoxifen and, if normal, yearly screening after 3 years of tamoxifen therapy, yearly surveillance for women with an abnormal baseline assessment and immediate investigation for symptomatic women.
