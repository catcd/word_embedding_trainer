Identification of patients at risk for drug-induced torsades de pointes arrhythmia (TdP) is difficult. Increased temporal lability of repolarization has been suggested as being valuable to predict proarrhythmia. The predictive value of different repolarization parameters, including beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (BVR), was compared in this serial investigation in dogs with chronic AV block.
In anesthetized dogs with electrically remodeled hearts, the dose-dependent difference in drug-induced TdP (d-sotalol, 2 and 4 mg/kg IV over 5 minutes, 25% and 75% TdP, respectively) could not be accounted for by prolongation of QT(c) (410+/-37 to 475+/-60 versus 415+/-47 to 484+/-52 ms, respectively). BVR was quantified by Poincare plots at baseline and immediately before onset of d-sotalol-induced extrasystolic activity. TdP occurrence was associated with an increase in short-term variability (STV) of the left ventricular monophasic action potential duration (3.5+/-1.5 to 5.5+/-1.6 versus 3.0+/-0.7 to 8.6+/-3.8 ms, respectively), which was reversible when TdP was abolished by I(K,ATP) activation. The absence of TdP despite QT(c) prolongation after chronic amiodarone treatment could also be explained by an unchanged STV. In experiments with isolated ventricular myocytes, STV increased after I(Kr) block and was highest in cells that subsequently showed early afterdepolarizations.
Proarrhythmia is not related to differences in prolongation of repolarization but corresponds to BVR, here quantified as STV of the left ventricle. STV could be a new parameter to predict drug-induced TdP in patients.
Streptomycin sulfate has been known to be ototoxic since its use in the treatment of tuberculosis. This report describes 10 years of experience in the treatment of Meniere's disease with streptomycin. Streptomycin has been used in classical Schuknecht ablation of the vestibular system in bilateral Meniere's disease; classical Schuknecht ablation of the vestibular system in unilateral Meniere's disease in the only hearing ear; intratympanic streptomycin in the treatment of unilateral Meniere's disease; and low-dose intramuscular streptomycin as outpatient treatment in unilateral Meniere's disease. The results of bilateral vestibular ablation were similar to Schuknecht's and others. Patients developed profound ataxia with a wide-based gait and oscillopsia, which improved rapidly over a period of months. Approximately 30% experienced significant improvement in hearing, which usually deteriorated again after several months. All patients were relieved of vertigo. Patients with unilateral Meniere's disease in the only hearing ear responded as did the bilateral cases. Hearing in the only hearing ear was preserved in all cases. Low-dose subototoxic streptomycin as outpatient treatment offers promise in some cases for relieving attacks of Meniere's disease while improving hearing without producing the temporary disabling effects of ataxia and oscillopsia. Streptomycin and similar drugs that may reduce the production of endolymph may eventually be the treatment of choice in Meniere's disease.
A 56-year-old man presented with recurrent smear and culture-negative meningitis having ingested Ibuprofen before each episode. The association between Ibuprofen and meningitis has been well established in systemic lupus erythematosus but has been reported only rarely in previously healthy patients.
Delirium is an organic psychiatric syndrome characterized by fluctuating consciousness and impaired cognitive functioning. High-potency typical neuroleptics have traditionally been used as first-line drugs in the treatment of delirium. However, these drugs are frequently associated with undesirable adverse events including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). The purpose of the present open-label, flexible-dose study was to provide preliminary data on the usefulness and safety of quetiapine for patients with delirium.
Twelve patients with DSM-IV delirium were treated with flexible doses of open-label quetiapine (mean +/- SD dosage = 44.9 +/- 31.0 mg/day). To evaluate the usefulness and safety of quetiapine, scores from the Delirium Rating Scale, Japanese version, were assessed every day (for 1 outpatient, at least twice per week), and scores from the Mini-Mental State Examination, Japanese version, and the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale were assessed at baseline and after remission of delirium. Data were gathered from April to October 2001.
All patients achieved remission of delirium several days after starting quetiapine (mean +/- SD duration until remission = 4.8 +/- 3.5 days). Quetiapine treatment was well tolerated, and no clinically relevant change in EPS was detected.
Quetiapine may be a useful alternative to conventional neuroleptics in the treatment of delirium due to its rapid onset and relative lack of adverse events. Further double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are warranted.
Alternatively spliced GNAS1 and XL-GNAS1, encoding respectively the stimulatory G-protein alpha-subunit (Gsalpha) and the extra-large stimulatory G-protein alpha-subunit (XLsalpha), are located on the imprinted chromosomal region 20q13.12-13. We presently report a functional polymorphism in the imprinted XL-GNAS1 gene. In three patients, a 36 bp insertion and two basepair substitutions flanking this insertion were found in the paternally inherited XL-GNAS1 exon 1. They clinically manifest an enhanced trauma-related bleeding tendency and a variable degree of mental retardation. A platelet aggregation inhibition test to evaluate Gs function was developed. Their platelets display Gs hyperfunction and an enhanced cAMP generation upon stimulation of Gs-coupled receptors. The prevalence of the XLsalpha insertion in a normal control group was 2.2%. Normal controls, inheriting the insertion maternally, had a normal platelet Gs activity, whereas controls inheriting the insertion paternally had increased inducible platelet Gs activity, defining the insertion as a functional polymorphism. This paternally inherited XLsalpha insertion represents a new genetic cause of an inherited bleeding tendency, although to a variable degree.
Thirty-two patients with psoriatic arthritis unresponsive to conventional therapy were treated wtih the antipyrimidine azaribine. For the group, improvement was highly significant (P less than 0.01) when average painful joint count, ring size, grip strength, pain, and morning gel were compared with baseline measurements. The spectrum of response of individual patients varied from total remission or arthritis in 5 patients to no improvement in 7. Dermatitis improved more than 50% in 26 patients. Reduction in hematocrit, gastrointestinal irritation, and occasional central nervous system toxicity were readily reversed by decreasing or discontinuing dosage. Azaribine appears to be a useful agent for trial in the treatment of refractory psoriatic arthritis.
Seizure causes neuronal cell loss in both animal models and human epilepsy. To determine the contribution of apoptotic mechanisms to seizure-induced neuronal cell death, rat brains were examined for the occurrence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive nuclei after pilocarpine-induced seizure. Numerous TUNEL-positive cells were observed throughout the postseizure hippocampus, piriform cortex, and entorhinal cortex. Combined TUNEL/NeuN immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the vast majority of TUNEL-positive cells were neurons. To identify components of the signal transduction cascade promoting postseizure apoptosis, the expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) was examined. Seizure-induced increases in p75NTR protein and mRNA were detected in hippocampus, piriform cortex, and entorhinal cortex. Immunohistochemical double labeling revealed almost complete correspondence between TUNEL-positive and p75NTR-expressing cells, suggesting that seizure-induced neuronal loss within the CNS occurs through apoptotic signaling cascades involving p75NTR.
The possibility of epilepsy resulting from maternal thalidomide ingestion was investigated by obtaining a telephoned neurological history from all suspect families in the United Kingdom in which the specific diagnosis was uncertain. The annual incidence in the first seven years of life was found to be five times the figure for the general population, and the prevalence of active epilepsy is significantly increased in the teenage thalidomide population. That this increased incidence and prevalence of epilepsy is not a chance observation is supported by published clinical and experimental evidence of central nervous system abnormalities in thalidomide embryopathy, in addition to the known neurological effects of the drug in the adult.
Nephrotoxicity severely limits the use of the anticancer drug cisplatin. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contribute to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. We developed novel orally active epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) analogs and investigated their prophylactic effect in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity was manifested by increases in blood urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine, urinary N-acetyl-Î²-(d)-glucosaminidase activity, kidney injury molecule 1, and histopathology. EET analogs (10 mg/kg/d) attenuated cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by reducing these renal injury markers by 40-80% along with a 50-70% reduction in renal tubular cast formation. This attenuated renal injury is associated with reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and ER stress evident from reduction in related biomarkers and in the renal expression of genes involved in these pathways. Moreover, we demonstrated that the attenuated nephrotoxicity correlated with decreased apoptosis that is associated with 50-90% reduction in Bcl-2 protein family mediated proapoptotic signaling, reduced renal caspase-12 expression, and a 50% reduction in renal caspase-3 activity. We further demonstrated in vitro that the protective activity of EET analogs does not compromise the anticancer effects of cisplatin. Collectively, our data provide evidence that EET analogs attenuate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, ER stress, and apoptosis without affecting the chemotherapeutic effects of cisplatin.
Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist with established anti-vasospastic action in man and, possibly cardioprotective effects during ischaemia. Although it is regularly used in the treatment of acute myocardial ischaemia, few double-blind randomized trials have been performed in this area. Recently, one trial was published which showed that nifedipine, when added to conventional treatment (beta-blockers, nitrates) of patients hospitalized for unstable angina pectoris (UAP) prevents recurrent ischaemia. Several further trials are known to be under way. The American nifedipine angina-myocardial infarction study (NAMIS) comprises sub-protocols both for patients diagnosed as UAP and patients diagnosed as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In the former, a comparison is made between a nifedipine and a propranolol based regimen. Recurrence of ischaemia is the end point. In the NAMIS-protocol for AMI; nifedipine is compared with placebo. Infarct-size and complications are the end points. The Holland Interuniversity Nifedipine/metoprolol Trial (HINT) is similar in design to the NAMIS UAP-study. However, it has a placebo group for comparison and also deals with the combination of nifedipine and beta-blockade. NAMIS and HINT may resolve several important questions in reference to the treatment of acute myocardial ischaemia but they are of insufficient size to study effects on total mortality. Finally, in the area of secondary prevention after MI, a major trial (secondary prevention reinfarction nifedipine trial: SPRINT) is known to be under way in Israel.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage colony stimulating factor plasma levels are elevated in acute coronary syndromes. IL-6 has an inherent negative inotropic action and, with tissue factor (TF), mediates the ischemia-reperfusion myocardial injury. We hypothesized that inducible ischemia leads to cytokine production, TF expression, and consequently persistent left ventricular dysfunction after dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in coronary artery disease patients.
DSE was performed in 103 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. Blood samples were obtained at rest, at peak stress, and 30 minutes after cessation of dobutamine infusion for measurement of macrophage colony stimulating factor, IL-6, and TF. New or worsening wall motion abnormalities at peak stress and their duration into recovery were noted. Median IL-6 and TF levels were increased at peak stress and at 30 minutes into recovery compared with rest (2.7 and 2.4 versus 2.1 pg/mL for IL-6, 310 and 385 versus 266 pg/mL for TF [P<0.01] in patients with an ischemic response; n=55). Compared with rest, a greater release of IL-6 at peak stress and recovery was observed in patients with increasing number of ischemic segments at peak DSE (2 versus 3 to 4 versus 5 to 6 versus 7 to 8 segments; P=0.03). The time to recovery of wall motion abnormalities was also associated with IL-6 levels at peak stress and recovery (r=0.51 and r=0.39, P<0.05). Macrophage colony stimulating factor levels remained unchanged throughout DSE.
Reversible ischemia induced during DSE increases IL-6 and TF plasma levels. IL-6 is related to the extent of left ventricular dysfunction at peak stress and to persistent LV dysfunction during recovery.
1. We investigated the regulation of the atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide genes in a rat model of myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol (IP rat) and in a rat model of cardiac hypertrophy induced by aorto-caval shunt (AC shunt rat). 2. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) mRNA levels in atria were significantly higher in IP rats than in controls at 18 h after the administration of isoproterenol, but not significant increases were observed in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA expression levels at any time point examined. In the ventricles, the BNP mRNA levels peaked at 18 h after isoproterenol administration, whereas ANP mRNA levels gradually increased until 3 days after isoproterenol administration. 3. The BNP mRNA levels in both atria and ventricles were significantly increased at 1 day after the introduction of aorto-caval shunt, while the ANP mRNA levels were not. 4. Plasma BNP levels were closely correlated with left ventricular weight per bodyweight, in both IP rats and AC shunt rats. 5. These results suggest the differential regulation of ANP and BNP genes in both the atria and ventricles in these two pathological models.
Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) rats have been used as an animal model for rheumatoid arthritis. Several studies have shown that the pharmacokinetics of a number of drugs are altered in AA rats. We investigated the effects of AA on the barrier functions of the intestine using a rat model. Intestinal CYP3A activities (midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and 7-benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin 7-hydroxylation) in AA rats were significantly decreased compared with those in normal rats, with marked decrease observed in the upper segment of intestine. Intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity at upper segment was also significantly decreased in AA rats to 60% of that in normal rats, and the other segments (middle and lower) of intestine also exhibited tendencies toward decrease in P-gp activity. This decrease was supported by the finding that levels of mdr1a mRNA and P-gp protein were decreased in AA rats. No significant differences were observed in intestinal paracellular and transcellular permeability between AA and normal rats. These results suggest that intestinal CYP3A and P-gp activities are decreased in AA rats, and that the pharmacokinetics and bioavailabilities of drugs whose membrane permeation is limited by intestinal CYP3A and/or P-gp may be altered in rheumatic diseases.
1. We investigated the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in cortisol induced hypertension using the technique of total autonomic blockade (AB). 2. Four healthy young males were given 50 mg cortisol 6 hourly for 6 days. On the day prior to, and the last day of, cortisol treatment, AB was produced using oral prazosin 1 mg, intravenous clonidine 300 micrograms, propranolol 0.2 mg/kg and atropine 2 mg. The adequacy of blockade was assessed using the haemodynamic response to Valsalva manoeuvre. 3. Cortisol produced a significant rise in systolic blood pressure (130 +/- 2 vs 110 +/- 1 mmHg, pre vs post cortisol; P < 0.01). On the final treatment day, AB augmented the increase in diastolic blood pressure (delta DBP), mean arterial pressure (delta MAP) and heart rate (delta HR) compared to the pretreatment day, delta DBP: 43 +/- 6 vs 17 +/- 4 mmHg, post vs pre cortisol, P < 0.005, delta MAP: 39 +/- 4 vs 14 +/- 4 mmHg, P < 0.001, delta HR: 45 +/- 5 vs 26 +/- 4 b.p.m., P < 0.05. The change in systolic blood pressure (delta SBP) was not statistically significant (32 +/- 4 vs 7 +/- 3 mmHg, P = 0.065). 4. These results suggest that the ANS exerts a modulating influence on the hypertensive effect of cortisol.
A short-term double-blind sequential trial of indomethacin against placebo in the treatment of low back pain, with and without nerve root pain such as sciatica, showed that indomethacin was significantly more effective than placebo in the group with nerve root pain. On the other hand, no difference was found between the treatments in the patients with uncomplicated low back pain. This difference may result from an effect of indomethacin on the inflammatory process around the nerve root which has been shown to be present when this is compressed.
The aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of "meth mouth" and the medical risks associated with this serious condition.
Methamphetamine is a very addictive, powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac dysrhythmias, hypertension, hallucinations, and violent behavior. Dental patients abusing methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene, xerostomia, rampant caries ("meth mouth"), and excessive tooth wear. Oral rehabilitation of patients using methamphetamine can be challenging.
A 30-year-old Caucasian woman presented with dental pain, bad breath, and self-reported poor esthetics. A comprehensive examination including her medical history, panoramic radiograph, and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions, which is not very common for a healthy adult. She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the drug.
The patient's medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of "meth mouth." Although three different dental treatment modalities (either conventional or implant-supported) have been offered to the patient since August 2007, the patient has yet to initiate any treatment.
This clinical case showing oral manifestations of meth mouth was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing methamphetamines. Dental practitioners also may be skeptical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients, as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification.
Migraine is often associated with health consequences including impaired quality of life, and the cost of treating migraine headaches places a significant financial burden on patients who suffer from migraines. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and triptans are commonly used for the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Aspirin is widely accepted as a treatment option for migraine pain relief and could provide an alternative not only for treatment of moderate migraine attacks, but also for severe migraine attacks. The efficacy and safety of 1,000 mg effervescent aspirin (eASA) was evaluated in comparison to 50 mg sumatriptan and placebo in an individual patient data meta-analysis of three randomized, placebo-controlled, single- dose migraine trials. Pain-relief at 2 h, pain-free at 2 h and sustained pain-free up to 24 h were calculated. For eASA, the response rates were 51.5 % (95 % CI: 46.6-56.5 %), 27.1 % (95 % CI: 22.6-31.4 %), and 23.5 % (95 % CI: 19.3-27.7 %). For sumatriptan, the response rates were 46.6 % (95% CI: 40.0-53.2 %), 29% (95 % CI: 23.0-34.9 %), and 22.2 % (95 % CI: 16.7-27.6 %). The corresponding rates for placebo were 33.9 % (95% CI: 29.1-38.6 %), 15.1 % (95 % CI: 11.5-18.7 %), and 14.6 % (95 % CI: 11.0-18.1 %). The treatment effect of eASA and sumatriptan were significantly different from placebo (p < 0.001), but differences between eASA and sumatriptan were not significant. The remission of accompanying symptoms and the subgroup analyses of patients with moderate or severe migraine pain at baseline revealed no significant differences between eASA and sumatriptan. Safety was evaluated based on the frequency of reported adverse events, and treatment with eASA was associated with lower incidence of adverse events than was with sumatriptan. This individual patient data meta-analysis provided evidence that eASA 1,000 mg is as effective as sumatriptan 50mg for the treatment of acute migraine attacks and has a better side effect profile. This is also true for patients with moderate as well as severe headache at baseline. Patients therefore should be advised to use eASA first for migraine attacks and use a triptan in case of no response.
The recurrent mossy fiber pathway of the dentate gyrus expands dramatically in the epileptic brain and serves as a mechanism for synchronization of granule cell epileptiform activity. It has been suggested that this pathway also promotes epileptiform activity by inhibiting GABA(A) receptor function through release of zinc. Hippocampal slices from pilocarpine-treated rats were used to evaluate this hypothesis. The rats had developed status epilepticus after pilocarpine administration, followed by robust recurrent mossy fiber growth. The ability of exogenously applied zinc to depress GABA(A) receptor function in dentate granule cells depended on removal of polyvalent anions from the superfusion medium. Under these conditions, 200 microM zinc reduced the amplitude of the current evoked by applying muscimol to the proximal portion of the granule cell dendrite (23%). It also reduced the mean amplitude (31%) and frequency (36%) of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Nevertheless, repetitive mossy fiber stimulation (10 Hz for 1 s, 100 Hz for 1 s, or 10 Hz for 5 min) at maximal intensity did not affect GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents evoked by photorelease of GABA onto the proximal portion of the dendrite, where recurrent mossy fiber synapses were located. These results could not be explained by stimulation-induced depletion of zinc from the recurrent mossy fiber boutons. Negative results were obtained even during exposure to conditions that promoted transmitter release and synchronized granule cell activity (6 mM [K(+)](o), nominally Mg(2+)-free medium, 33 degrees C). These results suggest that zinc released from the recurrent mossy fiber pathway did not reach a concentration at postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors sufficient to inhibit agonist-evoked activation.
A 16-year-old male started on isotretinoin 80 mg daily for acne developed persistent headache 3 weeks later, with myoclonus and confusion 10 weeks later. During initial hospital assessment his Glasgow Coma Scale score fell acutely to 8 and he required ventilation. Brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were normal and an electroencephalogram (EEG) showed features of encephalopathy. No cause was found. He was extubated after 24 hours and made a full recovery. This is the first report of a generalized encephalopathy thought likely to be due to isotretinoin.
Amplification of chromosome 11q13 is commonly seen in breast carcinomas and candidate genes from this region include CCND1 and EMSY. Here, we investigate the prognostic significance of CCND1 and EMSY amplification in a large series of breast carcinomas and in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation positive breast cancers. Amplification of CCND1 and EMSY was assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Both CCND1 and EMSY amplifications were associated with a significantly worse outcome in ER-positive patients treated with tamoxifen only, in contrast to nonamplified tumors (P = 8.55 x 10(-4) and P = 8.35 x 10(-5), respectively). In multivariable Cox models, which included standard prognostic markers, co-amplification of CCND1 and EMSY was significantly more predictive of outcome than was amplification of either gene alone or neither gene amplified in ER-positive tamoxifen-treated patients (P = 5.47 x 10(-5)). EMSY gene amplification was a significantly less common event in BRCA2 mutation carriers as compared to BRCA1 mutation carriers (9 versus 24%, respectively). In contrast, CCND1 amplification occurred at a similar frequency in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancers (22 versus 18%, respectively). In summary, co-amplification of CCND1 and EMSY identified a poor prognostic subset of ER-positive tamoxifen-treated patients. In addition, EMSY amplification occurred at a lower frequency in BRCA2 mutation carriers providing evidence to support EMSY amplification as a somatic surrogate for BRCA2 loss in sporadic breast cancer.
We presented evidence that primary cultures of rat pituitary cells respond to estradiol by increased incorporation of precursors into prolactin. The response is specific for estrogenic hormones and is maximal at physiological concentrations of estradiol. The time course and magnitude of the response in cultured cells is in agreement with that observed under in vivo conditions, suggesting that estrogen exerts its effect mainly through a direct action on the pituitary gland. The data presented indicate that estrogen stimulates prolactin synthesis predominantly through increased prolactin mRNA accumulation, and to a lesser extent, through mammotroph cell proliferation. Chronic treatment with DES caused sustained proliferation of pituitary cells leading to prolactin producing pituitary tumors in the Fischer 344 rat, but not in the Holtzman rat. The genetic basis for these differences are currently under investigation.
Inhaled nitric oxide, a selective pulmonary vasodilator, reverses hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and is an effective treatment in some cases of human pulmonary hypertension. Localization of nitric oxide synthase had indicated a neural role for nitric oxide. Thus, we studied the interactions between inhaled nitric oxide and systemic and pulmonary vascular reactivity in acute neurogenic hypertension. In 6 male beagle dogs (mean weight: 15 +/- 1 kg), anesthetized by chloralose (8 cg/kg) and in spontaneous ventilation, the hemodynamic effects on systemic and pulmonary circulation of inhaled nitric oxide (12 ppm) were studied before and after acute sino-aortic denervation. The hemodynamic effects of intravenous propranolol (300 micrograms/kg) were studied after denervation. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP), mean arterial pulmonary pressure (MAPP), cardiac input (CI) and oxygen venous saturation (SvO2) were measured. [table: see text] Sino-aortic denervation causes an acute and transitory pulmonary hypertension due to a double mechanism: a post-capillary hypertension (increase PCP) secondary to an increase left ventricular post-charge by systemic hypertension and a precapillary hypertension. In fact, vascular pulmonary resistances increase from 1.8 +/- 0.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.8 uW after denervation (p < 0.05). Change in pulmonary vascular reactivity induced by catecholamines is probably involved. Propranolol but not inhaled nitric oxide reverse pulmonary hypertension due to sino-aortic denervation.
Although it is clear that vascular endothelial cells synthesize and release endothelin (ET), the contribution of this vasconstrictor peptide to the regulation of vascular tone appears limited in normal conditions. One possibility to explain this moderate effect is that continuous production of nitric oxide (NO) may permanently inhibit the release and the vasoconstrictor effects of ET. In these conditions, inhibition of NO synthesis might unmask a vasopressor response to ET. Thus, we tested whether bosentan (3 mg/kg i.v.), a non-peptide antagonist of ETA and ETB receptors, or BQ-123 (3 mg/kg), an antagonist of ETA receptors, affected the hypertensive response induced by the NO synthase inhibitors NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME 3 mg/kg) or NG-nitro L-arginine (3 mg/kg) in anesthetized, normotensive rats. Bosentan or BQ-123 did not affect blood pressure. L-NAME significantly increased mean arterial pressure (% increase from baseline: 25 +/- 5%), and this was reduced by bosentan (13 +/- 3%; p < 0.05) or by BQ-123 (14 +/- 5%; p < 0.01). In contrast, bosentan did not affect the pressor response to phenylephrine. The response to L-NAME (3 mg/kg) was also reduced by bosentan in ganglion-blocked (chlorisondamine: 2.5 mg/kg; controls 89 +/- 10; bosentan: 45 +/- 7%) or pithed rats (controls: 165 +/- 9; bosentan 85 +/- 12%; p < 0.01). Bosentan also inhibited the pressor response to NG-nitro L-arginine (3 mg/kg-1) in normal (controls 24 +/- 5, bosentan 10 +/- 3%; p < 0.01) or ganglion-blocked rats (controls 86 +/- 13; bosentan 25 +/- 8; p < 0.01). Finally, L-NAME induced a modest increase in plasma levels of ET-1 (controls: 26.8 +/- 4.1; L-NAME: 38.5 +/- 3.3 pg/ml; p < 0.05). Thus, acute inhibition of NO synthesis unmasks a tonic vasopressor influence of ET.
In phenobarbitone-anesthetized rats the effects of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) were examined on the capsaicin-induced increase of plantar cutaneous blood flow in the rat hind paw as measured by laser Doppler flowmetry. IL-1 beta (0.5-500 pg) or TNF alpha or TNF beta (50-500 pg) was injected subcutaneously into the left paws, while the right paws received vehicle (10 microL) only. IL-1 beta was without effect on blood flow by its own but dose dependently enhanced the hyperemia due to capsaicin (0.3 microgram). TNFs failed to enhance the capsaicin-induced vasodilatation although 5000 pg TNF alpha produced a transient increase of local blood flow. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not alter the capsaicin-induced vasodilatation but prevented IL-1 beta (50 pg) from augmenting the hyperemic response to capsaicin. Likewise, blockade of nitric oxide formation by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) failed to affect the capsaicin-evoked vasodilatation but abolished its amplification by IL-1 beta. Systemic pretreatment with a neurotoxic dose of capsaicin reduced the capsaicin-induced hyperemia and prevented the facilitatory effect of IL-1 beta. The hyperemia evoked by intraplantar calcitonin gene related peptide (0.038-3.8 ng) was not altered by IL-1 beta (50 pg). These data indicate that IL-1 beta but not TNF enhances the cutaneous hyperemic response to capsaicin. This proinflammatory action arises from sensitization of afferent nerve endings and depends on nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase products as essential intermediates.
