The advent of HIV protease inhibitors has greatly extended the life span of AIDS patients. With an aging HIV(+) population, the cardiometabolic side effects of these drugs are becoming increasingly important clinical concerns. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that inhibition of adipose lipolysis will retard atherogenic lesion development induced by the antiviral protease inhibitors.
LDLR-null mice receiving ritonavir were compared with those receiving ritonavir plus lipolysis inhibitor acipimox or vehicle alone to determine how acipimox would affect ritonavir-induced atherogenesis. Intermittent high-fat high-cholesterol diet was used to facilitate optimal atheromatous lesion development. Drug effects were assessed as changes in aortic lesion score, plasma lipid and lipoprotein profile, body fat mass, and insulin-induced suppression of plasma fatty acid concentrations. Ritonavir increased aortic lesions, in association with decreased body fat mass, impaired antilipolysis action of insulin, and increased proatherogenic plasma lipoproteins. All these adverse effects were attenuated by cotreatment with acipimox.
Our results provide the first direct evidence that supports the hypothesis that dysregulation of adipose lipolysis is an important contributor to the proatherogenic role of selected HIV protease inhibitors.
Myopathy is a well-known side effect of corticosteroid therapy. Creatine monohydrate (Cr) supplementation has been shown to increase fat-free mass and muscular function. This study aimed to investigate if Cr administration could offset the deleterious functional effects of high doses of steroids. Fifty-six male Syrian golden hamsters were randomized among 4 groups: GI (n = 10), subcutaneous (s.c.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) saline; GII (n = 10), s.c. saline and i.p. Cr (600 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)); GIII (n = 18), s.c. dexamethasone (7.5 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) and i.p. saline; and GIV (n = 18), s.c. dexamethasone and i.p. Cr. Daily voluntary running was measured using activity wheels for 18 d. At the end of the study, statistically significant differences in running were observed between all groups, except for GI versus GII (GI, 8878 +/- 2737 m; GII, 9145 +/- 2000 m; GIII, 4289 +/- 2623 m; GIV, 6339 +/- 2345 m). Dexamethasone led to a significant decrease in cross-sectional area of type II fibers of the medial gastrocnemius. The cross-sectional area of type I fibers was significantly larger in GIV than in GIII. In conclusion, Cr administration attenuated the impairment of daily spontaneous running of hamsters receiving a high dose of corticosteroids. Additional research is needed to clarify the clinical implications of this finding.
We recently showed that indomethacin reduces lipoperoxidation occurring in the nonischemic zone (right ventricle + septum; RVS) of rat hearts with permanent coronary occlusion. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this biochemical effect is associated with an improvement of residual cardiac function or with modifications of delayed ventricular remodeling, or both. Rats received either indomethacin (1 mg/kg i.p.) or a placebo 5 min before coronary occlusion, and then twice a day for 48 hours. Six hours after ligation, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (leukocyte infiltration index) was measured in the ischemic zone (left ventricle; LV) and in RVS. Forty-eight hours after ligation, left ventricular function was assessed in vivo. Alterations in myocardial geometry were estimated 21 days after ligation on histologic cross-sections. In the indomethacin group, cardiac function was improved compared with that with placebo, and the indexes of ventricular remodeling were not affected by the treatment. Finally, indomethacin at the dose used did not affect MPO activity in the LV. It is concluded that indomethacin treatment leads to a better maintenance of residual nonischemic tissue contractility without worsening late ventricular shape changes. These results could in part be explained by the ability of the treatment to decrease inflammatory mediator-induced oxidative stress in RVS without affecting infarct healing caused by leukocyte infiltration in LV.
Sulfasalazine is a widely used anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and several rheumatological disorders. Although as many as 20% of treated patients may experience reversible, dose-dependent side effects, less frequent but potentially severe, systemic reactions have also been reported.
A severe systemic reaction to sulfasalazine developed in a 21-year old female with rheumatoid arthritis characterized by eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis and myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures. The clinical course and management of this patient are presented as well as a review of the incidence and outcome of severe systemic reactions to sulfasalazine.
Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.
Multiple episodes of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in developing rats (P7-P9) lead to progressive epileptiform activity and severe cognitive impairment in adulthood. The present work studied possible underlying abnormalities in the neocortex and hippocampus of pilocarpine-treated animals.
Wistar rats were submitted to pilocarpine-induced SE at P7, P8, and P9, and were killed at P35. Immunocytochemistry was performed on 50-microm vibratome sections, by using antibodies against nonphosphorylated neurofilament (SMI-311), parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD-65). Ten-micron cryostat sections were processed for immunohistoblot by using antibodies against GluR1, GluR2/3, and GluR4 alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits and NR2ab N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit.
Adult rats submitted to SE at P7-9 showed: (a) altered distribution of neocortical interneurons; (b) increased cortical and reduced hippocampal GAD-65 expression; and (c) altered expression of hippocampal AMPA and NMDA receptors.
We conclude that multiple SE episodes during P7-9 generate long-lasting disturbances that underlie behavioral and electrographic abnormalities later in life.
Captopril (C) causes ARF in hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) with a single functioning kidney (SK). Retrospective studies in two patients showed that episodes of C-induced ARF were preceded by a rise in urinary Na+ excretion and a rapid decrease in body weight. These observations prompted us to investigate whether extracellular fluid volume depletion secondary to C-induced natriuresis can be responsible for ARF. Prospective studies were performed in four patients with RAS-SK treated with C. These studies have shown that: ARF is associated with negative Na+ balance and is corrected by salt replacement, even without interrupting C; ARF is preceded by a rise in urinary prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 6-keto-F1 alpha; ARF is prevented by either saline infusion or aspirin administration; ARF does not occur when the dose of C is not sufficient to raise PGs and urinary N + excretion. We conclude therefore that C-induced ARF in patients with RAS-SK can be secondary to salt depletion dependent on a raised secretion of PGs.
A reversible toxic liver damage was observed in a non-alcoholic woman treated with disulfiram. The causative relationship was proven by challenge.
1. To characterize the vergence signal carried by the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), it was subjected to reversible blockade by small injections of 10% lidocaine hydrochloride. The effects of these blockades on both conjugate and vergence eye movements were studied. 2. With this procedure, experimentally induced internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) and its effects on conjugate eye movements could be studied acutely, without possible contamination from long-term oculomotor adaptation. In the eye contralateral to the MLF blockade, saccadic and horizontal smooth-pursuit eye movements were normal. Horizontal abducting nystagmus, often seen in patients with INO, was not observed in this eye. 3. As previously reported for INO, profound oculomotor deficits were seen in the eye ipsilateral to the MLF blockade. During maximal blockade, adducting saccades and horizontal smooth-pursuit movements in this eye did not cross the midline. Adducting saccades were reduced in amplitude and peak velocity and showed significantly increased durations. Abducting saccades, which were slightly hypometric, displayed a marked postsaccadic centripetal drift. 4. The eye ipsilateral to the blockade displayed a pronounced, upward, slow drift, whereas the eye contralateral to the blockade showed virtually no drift. Furthermore, although vertical saccades to visual targets remained essentially conjugate, the size of the resetting quick phases in each eye was related to the amplitude of the slow phase movement in that eye. Thus the eye on the affected side displayed large quick phases, whereas the eye on the unaffected side showed only slight movements. On occasion, unilateral downbeating nystagmus was seen. This strongly suggests that the vertical saccade generators for the two eyes can act independently. 5. The effect of MLF blockade on the vergence gain of the eye on the affected side was investigated. As a measure of open-loop vergence gain, the relationship of accommodative convergence to accommodation (AC/A) was measured before, during, and after reversible lidocaine block of the MLF. After taking conjugate deficits into account, the net vergence signal to the eye ipsilateral to the injection was found to increase significantly during the reversible blockade. 6. The most parsimonious explanation for this increased vergence signal is suggested by the accompanying single-unit study. This study showed that abducens internuclear neurons, whose axons course in the MLF, provide medial rectus motoneurons with an appropriate horizontal conjugate eye position signal but an inappropriate vergence signal. Ordinarily, this incorrect vergence signal is overcome by another, more potent, v
We demonstrated the effect of clonazepam (2 mg/day) on Meige syndrome in two schizophrenic patients under continuous treatment with antipsychotic drugs, and changes in the plasma levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in these cases. The plasma levels of HVA and MHPG during treatment with clonazepam were decreased in the responder, while not changed in the non-responder to clonazepam. A difference between the responder and the non-responder was not found in the plasma GABA levels. These results suggest that hyperactivities of the central dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurones are involved in the pathophysiology of Meige syndrome.
To report a case in which the aromatase inhibitor letrozole produced irritable mood elevation followed by depression in a woman with a history of postpartum depression.
A 60-year-old Caucasian woman who had a severe depressive episode after the birth of her only child, 32 years earlier, was treated successively with anastrozole and letrozole following a mastectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Mrs X was prescribed anastrozole for about 6 weeks. During this time she experienced labile mood, increased activity, tremulousness and difficulty sleeping. These symptoms disappeared after stopping the anastrozole. On letrozole, she developed an acute irritable activated mood elevation, which then subsided into a prolonged major depression after withdrawal of letrozole. These effects occurred during co-prescription of amitriptyline at a low dose for urinary frequency.
The present case suggests caution may be warranted when employing aromatase inhibitors, especially in women with a past history of postpartum affective disorder or bipolar disorder. As with postpartum mania, the primary mechanism of the effect may be acute reduction in circulating oestrogen levels.
The autosomal dominant, giant-platelet disorders, May-Hegglin anomaly (MHA; MIM 155100), Fechtner syndrome (FTNS; MIM 153640) and Sebastian syndrome (SBS), share the triad of thrombocytopenia, large platelets and characteristic leukocyte inclusions ('Döhle-like' bodies). MHA and SBS can be differentiated by subtle ultrastructural leukocyte inclusion features, whereas FTNS is distinguished by the additional Alport-like clinical features of sensorineural deafness, cataracts and nephritis. The similarities between these platelet disorders and our recent refinement of the MHA (ref. 6) and FTNS (ref. 7) disease loci to an overlapping region of 480 kb on chromosome 22 suggested that all three disorders are allelic. Among the identified candidate genes is the gene encoding nonmuscle myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9; refs 8-10), which is expressed in platelets and upregulated during granulocyte differentiation. We identified six MYH9 mutations (one nonsense and five missense) in seven unrelated probands from MHA, SBS and FTNS families. On the basis of molecular modelling, the two mutations affecting the myosin head were predicted to impose electrostatic and conformational changes, whereas the truncating mutation deleted the unique carboxy-terminal tailpiece. The remaining missense mutations, all affecting highly conserved coiled-coil domain positions, imparted destabilizing electrostatic and polar changes. Thus, our results suggest that mutations in MYH9 result in three megakaryocyte/platelet/leukocyte syndromes and are important in the pathogenesis of sensorineural deafness, cataracts and nephritis.
Interest in the physiologic and pharmacologic role of bioactive compounds present in plants has increased dramatically over the last decade. Of particular interest in relation to human health are the classes of compounds known as the phytoestrogens, which embody several groups of non-steroidal estrogens, including isoflavones and lignans that are widely distributed within nature. The impact of dietary phytoestrogens on normal biologic processes was first recognized in sheep. Observations of sheep grazing on fields rich in clover and cheetahs fed high soy diets in zoos suggested that flavonoids and related phytochemicals can affect mammalian health. Endogenous estrogens have an important role not only in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, but also in various non-gonadal systems, such as cardiovascular systems, bone, and central nervous systems, and lipid metabolism. There have been several clinical studies of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in post-menopausal women to examine whether HRT has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, bone fractures, lipid metabolism, and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, estrogen contributes to the development of some estrogen-dependent cancers, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer and the number of patients with these cancers is increasing in developed countries. Although recent mega-studies showed negative results for classical HRT in the prevention of some of these diseases, the molecules that interact with estrogen receptors are candidate drugs for various diseases, including hormone-dependent cancers. This review focuses on the molecular properties and pharmaceutical potential of phytoestrogens.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are members of the interleukin-1 receptor family and are involved in the responsiveness to pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Recent studies have demonstrated that TLRs are activated by endogenous signals, such as heat shock proteins and oxidative stress, which may contribute to congestive heart failure. Oxidative stress is one of the major factors in doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiac dysfunction. Thus, we hypothesized that TLRs contribute to the pathogenesis of Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Cardiac dysfunction was induced by a single injection of Dox (20 mg/kg IP) into wild-type (WT) mice and TLR-2-knockout (KO) mice. Five days after Dox injection, left ventricular dimension at end-diastole was smaller and fractional shortening was higher in KO mice compared with WT mice (P<0.01). Nuclear factor-kappaB activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines after Dox were suppressed in KO mice compared with WT mice (P<0.01). The numbers of TUNEL-positive nuclei and Dox-induced caspase-3 activation were less in KO mice than in WT mice (P<0.01). Survival rate was significantly higher in KO mice than in WT mice 10 days after Dox injection (46% vs 11%, P<0.05).
These findings suggest that TLR-2 may play a role in the regulation of inflammatory and apoptotic mediators in the heart after Dox administration.
Peripheral neuropathy has been noted as a complication of therapy with perhexiline maleate, a drug widely used in France (and in clinical trials in the United States) for the prophylactic treatment of angina pectoris. In 24 patients with this complication, the marked slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity and the electromyographic changes imply mainly a demyelinating disorder. Improvement was noted with cessation of therapy. In a few cases the presence of active denervation signified a poor prognosis, with only slight improvement. The underlying mechanism causing the neuropathy is not yet fully known, although some evidence indicates that it may be a lipid storage process.
1. The pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, metabolism and antihypertensive effects of nitrendipine have been studied in 12 patients with impaired renal function and moderate to severe hypertension. The drug was administered simultaneously by the i.v. [13C4] and oral (commercial tablet 20 mg) routes. 2. No differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between the two routes of administration. The systemic clearance after i.v. administration in patients with renal impairment (18.2 +/- 6.1 ml min-1 kg-1) was similar to that observed in healthy volunteers. Despite complete absorption of drug from the tablet the bioavailability of the parent compound was 21.2 +/- 12.5%. Cumulative urinary excretion of nitrendipine metabolites was correlated with the creatinine clearance (r = 0.946). 3. Significant reductions in mean arterial blood pressure (mean: 23.6%) at the end of the nitrendipine infusion and after oral administration of 20 mg (mean: 17.5%) were observed. The blood pressure lowering effect of nitrendipine could be correlated within individuals with serum nitrendipine concentrations using a log linear model. 4. Following 4 weeks of therapy an average dose of 77 mg nitrendipine day-1 was required to achieve a systolic blood pressure below 160 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. The reduction in blood pressure during multiple dosing was related to the nitrendipine steady-state concentration. There was a significant relationship between the nitrendipine bioavailability and the dose required for sufficient blood pressure control. 5. No accumulation of nitrendipine caused by impaired renal function was observed during multiple dosing. Thus, no reduction of the nitrendipine dose in patients with renal impairment is necessary.
Time may be an important variable when evaluating the efficacy of lipid-altering drugs. In this analysis of the Advicor Versus Other Cholesterol-Modulating Agents Trial Evaluation, niacin extended-release/lovastatin 1000/40 mg was as effective as atorvastatin 10 mg and more effective than simvastatin (both 10 mg and 20 mg) in achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goals. The titration schedule for this study included the initiation of niacin-extended release/lovastatin 500/20 mg once a day for 4 weeks, titrated to the starting dose of 1000/40 mg after 4 weeks, and then titrated to the final dose of 2000/40 mg. The titration schedule for both atorvastatin and simvastatin was 10 mg per day for 8 weeks and then titrated to 40 mg per day. Using this schedule, 50% of niacin extended-release/lovastatin and atorvastatin patients reached low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goals within approximately 7 weeks, compared with simvastatin, in which 50% reached both treatment goals in 13-14 weeks. These time differences may have potential clinical relevance in reducing coronary heart disease risk.
Motor limbic seizures occur following a systemic injection of pilocarpine (380 mg/kg) in rats. Focal injection of the selective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, (+/-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (2-APH, 5-20 pmol), bilaterally into the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) prior to pilocarine blocks these seizures. Muscimol (50 pmol), a potent gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist, injected bilaterally into EP produces a similar protection against pilocarpine-induced seizures. Thus by blocking excitatory neurotransmission or facilitating inhibition within the EP, the severity of limbic seizures can be reduced.
Adenoviruses can cause severe toxicity in children and in immunocompromised adults, and therefore a means to abrogate replication would be useful. With regard to cancer treatment, replication competent oncolytic adenoviruses have been safe in humans, although their efficacy has been variable. Therefore, more effective agents are now entering clinical testing and, consequently, replication-associated side effects remain a concern. Preclinical analysis of replication related toxicity has been hampered by a lack of permissive models. Therefore, it has been difficult to study modulation of human adenovirus replication in immune competent animals.
We investigated four different hamster carcinoma cell lines for transduction and cell killing potency in vitro and in vivo. Gene transfer was assessed using replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing luciferase. Cell killing was studied in vitro and in vivo using an oncolytic adenovirus that kills tumor cells by viral replication. After the most promising animal model had been selected, abrogation of virus replication was assessed in vitro and in vivo using a TCID(50) assay.
The results obtained suggest wild-type adenovirus replication in all four tested Syrian hamster cell lines and also normal organs. Virus replication could be abrogated with chlorpromazine, cidofovir and cytosine arabinoside, and the effect occurred subsequent to nuclear delivery of the viral genome. Attenuation of virus replication also was seen in vivo both in tumors and the liver.
Syrian hamsters may comprise a valuable immune competent model for evaluating anti-adenoviral drugs. Furthermore, chlorpromazine or cidofovir might be useful in case of adenovirus replication-associated symptoms in humans.
A maculopapular rash has been associated with the administration of imipenem-cilastatin, an antibiotic that was used for treatment of a postoperative infection. This is a first-time association of imipenem with a leukocytoclastic vasculitic reaction. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis has been previously documented with ciprofloxacin, zidovudine, piperazine, and lithium.
Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (Type II HAT), the "white clot syndrome," has not been previously reported as a cause for fulminant hepatic failure after liver transplantation. Thrombocytopenia and the use of heparin are common events in the newly transplanted patient. A man who was transplanted for sclerosing cholangitis, and re-exposed to heparin, is described with thrombocytopenia, thrombosis of all hepatic vessels, and heparin antibodies. Type II HAT is an immune phenomenon that can apparently occur despite T-cell-directed immunosuppression. Suspicion is a key element in establishing diagnosis. We no longer use heparin routinely in liver transplant cases.
Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) is a distinct form of common food allergy characteristically induced by a combination of causative food ingestion and physical exercise. Recent investigations have documented that aspirin consumption, in place of exercise, also induces allergic symptoms.
A 63-year-old man began low dose aspirin therapy on September 2005. Since January 2006, he had repeated episodes of generalized urticaria and lost consciousness while he was exercising after eating wheat. He was strongly positive for omega-5 gliadin in a cap-system fluorescent enzyme immunoassay. Therefore, a diagnosis of wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis was made.
Patients with aspirin-provoked FDEIA have been reported previously as taking ordinary doses of aspirin for reducing pain, inflammation and fever. However, in our patient, low dose aspirin therapy for reducing cardiovascular risk possibility induced FDEIA. Growing numbers of elderly people take low doses of aspirin for prevention of cerebral or myocardial infarction. Therefore, physicians should remember that aspirin consumption, even at low doses, is a risk factor for FDEIA.
Two antibiotic tetracyclines, demeclocycline (DMC) and minocycline, share several biochemical and behavioral properties with lithium (Li). DMC inhibited both noradrenaline- and chloradenosine-sensitive cyclic AMP accumulation in rat cerebral cortical slices both in vitro and ex vivo following two weeks of chronic dietary treatment. Minocycline, a lipophilic tetracycline, produced similar results in vitro. Both DMC and minocycline reduced open-field activity levels in rats following acute treatment, four hours prior to testing. Moreover, both drugs inhibited amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in the open field. Chronic treatment with 0.4% and 0.8% dietary DMC for two weeks attenuated amphetamine hyperactivity without affecting baseline activity levels in the open field. Neither DMC nor minocycline attenuated apomorphine-induced stereotypy at doses that attenuated amphetamine hyperactivity, a profile which is similar to that of lithium. Unlike lithium, however, DMC did not reverse reserpine-induced hypoactivity.
The mechanism for secretin-induced gastrin release in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is uncertain. We evaluated whether the stimulatory effect of intravenous secretin on gastrin release was partly mediated through a beta-adrenergic stimulatory mechanism. Serum gastrin concentrations and heart rate were monitored in six patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Secretin (2 clinical units/kg) increased mean serum gastrin concentrations from 1558 pg/ml basally to a peak of 3683 pg/ml (136% above baseline). This increase was not altered by pretreatment with 2 mg of propranolol intravenously, a dose which in previous studies blocked terbutaline-induced gastrin release. Secretin increased heart rate by 14 beats/min (20% above base-line) and this also was not altered by propranolol pretreatment. Thus, the stimulatory effects of secretin on gastrinoma cells and the heart do not appear to be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors.
Antidepressants are often used to treat chronic daily headache disorders such as transformed migraine, in part because of the high prevalence of associated mood disorder. We conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of combined treatment with amitriptyline and fluoxetine compared with amitriptyline alone for chronic daily headache due to transformed migraine.
Thirty-nine patients, 26 women and 13 men, aged 20 to 69 years (mean, 36.4; SD, 2.5) who fulfilled criteria for transformed migraine proposed by Silberstein et al were studied prospectively. Amitriptyline was dosed as follows: 8 mg/day for 6 days, 8 mg twice a day for 6 days, 20 mg/day for 6 days, and 20 mg twice a day for 45 days. In the group receiving combination therapy, fluoxetine was dosed and administered identically. The initial and end of the study (9 weeks) headache indices (frequency x intensity) were compared between groups.
Twenty-seven patients completed the study, 13 in the amitriptyline-alone group (group 1) and 14 in the combination-therapy group (group 2). The most frequent adverse event in both groups was dry mouth, and there was no significant difference in the occurrence of this or other adverse events between the two groups. Initial headache indices were similar for groups 1 and 2. The mean difference between the initial and final headache index for group 1 was 513.5 (P<.0005) and 893 (P<.0017) for group 2. The difference between the final headache index for the two groups was not significant (P>.207).
We were unable to demonstrate any significant benefit from amitriptyline plus fluoxetine over amitriptyline alone in the treatment of chronic daily headache/transformed migraine. Because of the small number of subjects involved and the short duration of our study, a type II error cannot be excluded.
Ulnar-mammary syndrome is a rare pleiotropic disorder affecting limb, apocrine gland, tooth and genital development. We demonstrate that mutations in human TBX3, a member of the T-box gene family, cause ulnar-mammary syndrome in two families. Each mutation (a single nucleotide deletion and a splice-site mutation) is predicted to cause haploinsufficiency of TBX3, implying that critical levels of this transcription factor are required for morphogenesis of several organs. Limb abnormalities of ulnar-mammary syndrome involve posterior elements. Mutations in TBX5, a related and linked gene, cause anterior limb abnormalities in Holt-Oram syndrome. We suggest that during the evolution of TBX3 and TBX5 from a common ancestral gene, each has acquired specific yet complementary roles in patterning the mammalian upper limb.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a primary cause of invasive bacterial infection and pneumonia and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In prior studies we showed that pre-treating mice with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a potent agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), protects against S. pneumoniae-induced mortality and reduces pulmonary bacterial burden. The current studies were conducted to help elucidate the mechanism for this protective effect, and to characterize the response in the lung during the first 10h following infection. C57Bl/6 mice were treated with TCDD one day prior to intranasal infection with serotype 3 S. pneumoniae. Monitoring of bacteria in the lung airways revealed that bacterial growth was inhibited in the TCDD-treated animals within 10h of infection. To address the mechanism of this rapid protective response, macrophages, neutrophils, and invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells were quantified, and levels of natural antibodies produced by B-1 B cells were evaluated. Functional assays addressed whether AhR activation reduced the capacity of lung epithelial cells to bind bacteria, and whether TCDD treatment enhanced production of antimicrobial agents in the lung or blood. None of the hypothesized mechanisms was able to explain the protective effect. Finally, the exposure paradigm was manipulated to test whether administration of TCDD after instillation of the bacteria was also protective. Results showed that TCDD must be administered in advance of exposure to bacteria, suggesting that the lung environment is rendered inhospitable to the pathogens.
We investigated the use of analgesics containing phenacetin or acetaminophen in 173 young women with urinary bladder cancer and 173 matched controls. The cases, who were 20 to 49 years old at the time of diagnosis of cancer, were 6.5 times more likely to report regular use of analgesics containing phenacetin at least one year before diagnosis than were their matched controls (odds ratio, 6.5; 95 per cent confidence interval, 1.5 to 59.2). Among the 15 women (13 cases and 2 controls) reporting regular use of phenacetin-containing drugs, 8 of the cases and 1 of the controls reported daily use for over one year (P = 0.04). Excessive use of analgesics containing acetaminophen was not reported. The increased risk of bladder cancer in young women who regularly used phenacetin-containing products remained present after adjustments for all other identified risk factors.
