Induced mainly by cigarette smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global public health problem characterized by progressive difficulty in breathing and increased mucin production. Previously, we reported that acrolein levels found in COPD sputum could activate matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9).
To determine whether acrolein increases expression and activity of MMP14, a critical membrane-bound endopeptidase that can initial a MMP-activation cascade.
MMP14 activity and adduct formation were measured following direct acrolein treatment. MMP14 expression and activity was measured in human airway epithelial cells. MMP14 immunohistochemistry was performed with COPD tissue, and in acrolein- or tobacco-exposed mice.
In a cell-free system, acrolein, in concentrations equal to those found in COPD sputum, directly adducted cysteine 319 in the MMP14 hemopexin-like domain and activated MMP14. In cells, acrolein increased MMP14 activity, which was inhibited by a proprotein convertase inhibitor, hexa-d-arginine. In the airway epithelium of COPD subjects, immunoreactive MMP14 protein increased. In mouse lung, acrolein or tobacco smoke increased lung MMP14 activity and protein. In cells, acrolein-induced MMP14 transcripts were inhibited by an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing antibody, EGFR kinase inhibitor, metalloproteinase inhibitor, or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 3/2 or MAPK8 inhibitors, but not a MAPK14 inhibitor. Decreasing the MMP14 protein and activity in vitro by small interfering (si)RNA to MMP14 diminished the acrolein-induced MUC5AC transcripts. In acrolein-exposed mice or transgenic mice with lung-specific transforming growth factor-alpha (an EGFR ligand) expression, lung MMP14 and MUC5AC levels increased and these effects were inhibited by a EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib.
Taken together, these findings implicate acrolein-induced MMP14 expression and activity in mucin production in COPD.
We report clinically rare and serious adverse reactions that occurred after the co-administration of ranitidine, ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin: completely reversible aseptic meningitis and irreversible bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and vestibulopathy. Recurrent urinary inflammations treated with antibacterials, classic familial migraine, and allergy to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and chromium were favourable predisposing factors for the adverse event in this patient. A close chronological relation between administration of drugs (especially ibuprofen) and adverse reactions was noted. No evidence of infection and/or autoimmune disease was found. The mechanism of these serious events may be explained as a hypersensitive reaction affecting the meninges and, partially, cochlea.
The aim of this study was to determine if CPU228, a derivative of dofetilide, is more effective than dofetilide in attenuating isoproterenol-induced heart failure by recovering downregulated FK506 binding protein (FKBP12.6), and suppressing oxidative stress, upregulated NADPH oxidase and protein kinase C epsilon (PKC epsilon) hyperphosphorylation in the myocardium.
Heart failure was induced by isoproterenol (1 mg/kg s.c. for 5 days) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Intervention with either CPU228 or dofetilide (2 mg/kg on Days 3-5) was then conducted in vivo and in vitro.
Isoproterenol produced compromised left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular pressure rise (dp/dt(max)) and fall (dp/dt(min)), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, associated with oxidative stress, abnormal FKBP12.6, NADPH oxidase p67phox and PKC epsilon in the myocardium. CPU228 was more effective in attenuating these changes than dofetilide in vivo. Dofetilide produced a prolonged QTc to replace a shortened one. In primary neonatal cardiomyocytes, cultured with isoproterenol and treated with either CPU228 or dofetilide at 10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/l, isoproterenol produced a hyperadrenergic state characterized by downregulated FKBP12.6, upregulated NADPH oxidase p67phox and PKC epsilon in vitro. CPU228 was more effective than dofetilide in recovering these changes in a dose-dependent manner without a prolonged QTc.
CPU228 was more effective than dofetilide in attenuating heart failure by normalizing isoproterenol-induced changes, including downregulation of FKBP12.6, upregulation of NADPH oxidase and PKC epsilon hyperphosphorylation in vivo and in vitro.
Erythropoietin has anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. We wanted to evaluate its activity in preventing damage to the gastric mucosa.
We examined the protective effect of erythropoietin on indometacin-induced gastric mucosa damage in the rat stomach and compared its potency with that of famotidine. We also measured effects on oxidant and antioxidant parameters in the rat stomach.
Famotidine and erythropoietin 2500 and 5000 IU/kg reduced the ulcer area by 98%, 31% and 58%, respectively, compared with the indometacin group. Superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione level were decreased and myeloperoxidase activity increased in the indometacin group compared with healthy rats. Famotidine and erythropoietin at all doses increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels significantly compared with the indometacin group. Myeloperoxidase activity was decreased by erythropoietin and famotidine.
These results support the view that erythropoietin counteracts the effects of indometacin in inducing gastric ulcer and could be used as a an antiulcer compound. Its antiulcer effect is less potent than that of famotidine. The antiulcerogenic effects of erythropoietin may be related to its intrinsic ability to sustain the activities of free-radical scavenging enzymes and the bioavailability of glutathione.
Recently, pleural mesothelioma has been treated by cytoreductive surgery and intraoperative hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cisplatin. The well-established cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin and distressing data from an animal study raised concern about its impact on cardiac function. In the present study, early cardiotoxicity of this treatment modality was prospectively analyzed.
In 13 pleural mesothelioma patients, cardiotoxicity was monitored by clinical examination, electrocardiography, Troponin levels, cardiac ultrasonography, and estimation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by radionuclide ventriculography before and during the first 6 months after cytoreductive surgery and intraoperative hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy with doxorubicin (25-54 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (65-120 mg/m(2)).
No clinical cardiac failure or treatment-related death was observed. In two patients transient atrial fibrillation was noted; one associated with pulmonary emboli. Early posttreatment Troponin release was not of predictive value. Ultrasonography did not reveal significant alterations. LVEF decreased significantly (mean 0.07 or 11%, P = .001) during the first 3 months and remained stable thereafter. In univariate analysis, the degree of LVEF reduction was statistically related to maximal intrathoracic doxorubicin concentration (P = .031) and total cisplatin dose (P = .029). Direct exposure of the heart to the drugs as a result of partial pericardectomy was not associated with greater LVEF decrease. On the contrary, partial pericardectomy seemed to be associated with a smaller LVEF decline than when the pericardium remained intact (P = .045). In this small series, no statistically significant correlation between other treatment or pharmacokinetic parameters and LVEF decline was found. Notably, higher doxorubicin plasma concentrations and exposure were not associated with increased LVEF reduction.
Early cardiotoxicity is limited after this treatment modality using substantial doses of doxorubicin and cisplatin. Hence, this study suggests that intrathoracic chemotherapy with doxorubicin and/or cisplatin may be used for primary and secondary pleural malignancies, even immediately after extensive thoracic surgery, without concern of severe early cardiotoxicity.
Recently the new specific phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil was introduced into therapy for erectile dysfunction. Because of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor-induced increases of cyclic GMP in the vasculature, vasodilation in various vascular beds is induced, which in combination with various nitrovasodilators (e.g., when used simultaneously for the treatment of coronary artery disease), may lead to excessive hypotension. Thus nitrovasodilators are contraindicated when sildenafil may be used and reports of a number of accidents have recently been published. We therefore studied the acute interactions of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) with sildenafil in six chronically instrumented conscious dogs for each nitrate to assess the magnitude of blood pressure drops (and compensatory increases in heart rate) during a 24-h nitrate administration (infusion into the pulmonary artery). Sildenafil (3 mg/kg) was given orally (after a 24-h fast) 30 min after start of nitrate infusion. GTN, PETN, or ISDN (which follow different steps of metabolic conversion to nitric oxide) were applied at submaximal dosages leading to 90% of maximal coronary artery dilation at 1.5 microg/kg per min, 0.75 microg/kg per min, or 6 microg/kg per min, respectively. During GTN infusion sildenafil caused a maximum drop in mean blood pressure of 21 +/- 3 mm Hg (rise in heart rate from 117.0 +/- 7.2 to 126.0 +/- 6 .0/min) and during ISDN infusion of 18 +/- 3 mm Hg (rise in heart rate from 115.0 +/- 7.0 to 125 +/- 6/min), which was significantly less (p < 0.01) during PETN (only 6 +/- 1 mm Hg with a rise in heart rate from 107.0 +/- 5.0 to 122.0 +/- 7.0/min). When sildenafil is used during exposure to nitrates (e.g., in coronary artery disease), the PETN-induced drop in blood pressure at equi-effective dosages (with regard to coronary dilation) is substantially smaller compared with that of GTN or ISDN, which is probably because of lesser potentiation of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor-induced effects in the arteriolar bed, thus minimizing critical drops in blood pressure.
A 56 year-old man was referred to hospital for evaluation of syncopal episodes. During head-up tilt testing, his symptom was reproduced, associated with bradycardia and hypotension, by a low dose of isoproterenol (0.02 microg. kg (-1). min(-1)) infusion in the supine position before tilting-up. Isoproterenol infusion can provoke a vasovagal response without tilting. Careful observation of the patient's hemodynamics is mandatory not only during tilting, but also in the supine position before tilting-up.
The central and peripheral nervous system effects of acute and subchronic exposure to three organic phosphoro-acid esters (dimethoate, dichlorvos, parathion-methyl) were studied. CNS-dependent variables included mean EEG amplitude, mean frequency of the EEG, and the activity (power density) of six component frequency bands. Peripheral nervous system evaluations included determinations of conduction velocity, and both relative and absolute refractory periods. Cholinesterase activity was measured in blood, brain and other organs. The results indicate that acute large doses of these agents produce substantial changes in these measures of CNS and PNS function. In subchronic experiments it was found that a six weeks administration of 1/50 LD50 of the chemicals induced early functional changes in both the central and the peripheral nervous systems. It is recommended that when cholinesterase inhibition is detected in humans, functional evaluations of CNS and PNS should follow.
The authors tested the use of repeated cognitive measures to identify those older individuals who experience cognitive decline after administration of a centrally acting medication. Subjects were 30 medically stable, older volunteers, mean age 71.4. Administration was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover "challenge" from baseline to placebo, 50 mg, or 75 mg of diphenhydramine. More patients exhibited significant cognitive decrements after 75 mg of diphenhydramine than after placebo on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test Total Recall and the Trails B test. Data were consistent with models based on prediction intervals. Quantitative algorithms using prediction equations can characterize the normal limits of within-subject variability and define excessive cognitive change in elderly subjects, showing promise for use in monitoring patients to identify those who experience mild cognitive toxicity from prescribed medications.
Organophosphate poisoning is well known for its characteristic symptoms and signs, but food poisoning caused by pesticide-contaminated food is seldom reported.
We report three incidents of food poisoning that resulted from exposure to the organophosphate insecticide methamidophos in vegetables. These outbreaks caused a cholinergic syndrome in 4 patients. The cholinergic overactivity led as to suspect organophosphate food poisoning. All patients recovered well following appropriate therapy. The clinical diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning was confirmed by reduced levels of erythrocytes and plasma cholinesterase and the presence of methamidophos in the vegetable leftovers. The implicated vegetables and levels of methamidophos were: Ipomoea batatas 255 ppm, Gynura bicolor 110 ppm, and red cabbage 26.3 ppm. Since methamidophos is normally applied to vegetables during planting, improper selection and/or overuse of pesticide or improper harvest times may explain the occurrence of these high residue levels of methamidophos.
In a double-blind cross-over trial 15 captopril (daily dose 600 mg) treated patients, received in addition to the converting-enzyme inhibitor, placebo or bendrofluazide (7.5 mg). Bendrofluazide lowered blood pressure, while body weight decreased slightly. During captopril-bendrofluazide treatment, the plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated, while no effect on the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha was found.
The combination of artesunate and mefloquine is currently one of the most effective treatments against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. To improve patient compliance to such a combination, the two agents have been combined in a prepacked single blister. Patients were instructed to simultaneously co-administer the drugs once a day for three days. In the present randomized, double-blind, parallel group, comparative, single center study in Thailand, this concept was investigated in 204 adults and children with acute, uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Patients were randomized into two treatment groups and received once a day over a three-day period the following: Group A received artesunate, 4-5 mg/kg/day, and mefloquine, total dose = 25 mg/kg, approximately 8.5 mg/kg/day, simultaneously. Group B received artesunate, 4-5 mg/kg/day, and mefloquine, total dose = 25 mg/kg, sequentially (i.e., no mefloquine dose on the first day, 15 mg/kg on the second day, and 10 mg/kg on the third day). Both treatment groups showed no relevant differences in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed a cure rate at day 28 (primary endpoint) of 100% in group A and 99% in group B (difference not significant). The secondary endpoints of mean time to fever clearance (group A = 34 hours, group B = 31 hours) and mean time to parasite clearance (group A = 44 hours group B = 48 hours) were similar between groups (both differences not significant). Tolerability was good in both treatment groups, with no difference in the overall incidence of adverse events. There was a low incidence of nausea/vomiting (4.9% in both groups) and central nervous system side effects (4.9% in group A versus 8.8% in group B). These were comparable between groups and generally of a mild nature. The three-day combination of artesunate and mefloquine (Artequin, Mepha, Ltd., Aesch, Switzerland) with the introduction of mefloquine on day 1 offers a practical dosing regimen that is highly effective and well tolerated in patients of different ages with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. It is likely that the prepacked blister approach translates clinically into a better patient compliance, thereby contributing to limit the development of drug resistance.
Pilocarpine (PILO) induces in rats limbic seizures that become secondarily generalized and evolve to status epilepticus (SE). Spontaneous recurrent seizures are registered during the long-term period following the systemic administration of PILO in rats. EEG, behavioral, and pathological features resemble those of complex partial seizures. The antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) diazepam, phenobarbital (PB), valproic acid (VPA) and trimethadione protect against PILO-induced SE while phenytoin (PHT) and carbamazepine (CBZ) are ineffective. Studies with AEDs on spontaneous seizures (chronic period) of this model have not yet been established. We now report the effects of different AEDs on spontaneous seizures. Male Wistar rats were subjected to PILO-induced SE. Following recovery from SE animals were daily observed in order to detect spontaneous seizures and to establish the baseline seizure frequency. PB 40 mg/kg, PHT 100 mg/kg, CBZ 120 mg/kg, VPA (450 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg) and ethosuximide (ETX) 400 mg/kg were given daily to epileptic rats for two weeks during the spontaneous recurrent seizures period. PB, CBZ and PHT were effective against spontaneous seizures. VPA was also effective against spontaneous seizures at the dose of 600 mg/kg and ETX was inactive against these seizures. Such pharmacological profiles correlate well with complex partial seizures. The results indicate that spontaneous recurrent seizures after PILO-induced SE may be a useful model for finding new AEDs with better efficacy against complex partial seizures. The use of animal models that share both pharmacological and phenomenological features with human epilepsy might improve their predictive value for specific types of human epilepsy.
The combination of tobramycin and ticarcillin is an established regimen used to empirically treat patients with granulocytopenia and fever. However, the clinician now has a plethora of newer alternative antibiotic combinations from which to choose. In this retrospective study of 25 granulocytopenic patients recently treated with tobramycin and ticarcillin, a combined favorable or partial response rate of 78% was achieved, without loss of efficacy over time as a result of emerging resistance of organisms. Our reevaluation of this antibiotic regimen emphasizes that it continues to be as efficacious and safe as newer antibiotic combinations, and supports its continued use until a newer regimen is shown to have significant advantages. This study also emphasizes the significance of staphylococci as pathogens in granulocytopenia, and suggests the need to add specific antistaphylococcal coverage whenever catheter-related infection is suspected.
The effects of sex steroids and prolactin on haloperidol-induced catalepsy were investigated in male rats. Repeated administration with estradiol benzoate (5 micrograms/rat, twice daily for 10 days) significantly potentiated catalepsy induced by 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg haloperidol, but no effect was observed 10 min or 1 h after a single injection of estradiol benzoate (5 or 50 micrograms/rat). Conversely, a single administration with the catecholestrogen 2-hydroxyestradiol (50 micrograms/rat) significantly increased haloperidol-induced catalepsy, suggesting that catecholestrogens may directly interfere with nigrostriatal dopaminergic transmission. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy has been found to be attenuated in conditions of hyperprolactinaemia resulting from anterior pituitary isograft underneath the kidney capsule. This is consistent with the hypothesis that prolactin may stimulate nigro-striatal dopaminergic function. Results obtained also indicate that medroxy-acetate progesterone, a progesterone derivative, may influence haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Specifically, a single administration with medroxy-acetate progesterone (5 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced catalepsy but opposite effects were observed after repeated administration of medroxy-acetate progesterone (5 mg/kg, i.p., once a day for 7 days).
CDw150, a receptor up-regulated on activated T or B lymphocytes, has a key role in regulating B cell proliferation. Patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease have mutations in a gene encoding a protein, DSHP/SAP, which interacts with CDw150 and is expressed in B cells. Here we show that CDw150 on B cells associates with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, 59 kDa and 145 kDa in size. The 59-kDa protein was identified as the Src-family kinase Fgr. The 145-kDa protein is the inositol polyphosphate 5'-phosphatase, SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP). Both Fgr and SHIP interact with phosphorylated tyrosines in CDw150's cytoplasmic tail. Ligation of CDw150 induces the rapid dephosphorylation of both SHIP and CDw150 as well as the association of Lyn and Fgr with SHIP. CD95/Fas-mediated apoptosis is enhanced by signaling via CDw150, and CDw150 ligation can override CD40-induced rescue of CD95-mediated cell death. The ability of CDw150 to regulate cell death does not correlate with serine phosphorylation of the Akt kinase, but does correlate with SHIP tyrosine dephosphorylation. Thus, the CDw150 receptor may function to regulate the fate of activated B cells via SHIP as well as via the DSHP/SAP protein defective in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease patients.
In this study, we report the protective effects of IAA on diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. BALB/c mice received daily IAA at 50 (T(50)), 250 (T(250)), and 500 (T(500)) mg Kg(-1) per body mass by gavage for 15 days. At day 15, animals were administered DEN and sacrificed 4 h later. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were analyzed in sera. In addition, hepatomorphologic alterations, activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR), gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and DNA integrity were evaluated in the liver. IAA administration did not show any alterations in any of the parameters available, except for a reduction of the gene expression for antioxidant enzymes by 55, 56, 27, and 28% for SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR upon T(500), respectively compared with the control. Several hepatic alterations were observed by DEN exposure. Moreover, IAA administration at 3 doses was shown to provide a total prevention of the active reduction of CAT and GR induced by DEN exposure compared with the control. IAA at T(500) was shown to give partial protection (87, 71, 57, and 90% for respectively SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR) on the down-regulation of the enzymes induced by DEN and this auxin showed a partial protection (50%) on DEN-induced DNA fragmentation for both parameters when compared to DEN alone. This work showed IAA hepatocarcinogenesis protection for the first time by means of a DEN-protective effect on CAT and GR activity, and by affecting antioxidant gene expression and DNA fragmentation.
A 13-year-old boy presented with juvenile chronic arthritis of 6 months' duration. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were not detected. Western blotting showed a deficiency of the beta subunit of the eighth component of complement. The same deficiency was present in the patient's sister. C8 beta deficiency is usually detected in individuals who survive meningococcal disease. There was no such history in this family. Juvenile chronic arthritis has not previously been described in patients with C8 beta deficiency.
Postoperative shivering and pain are frequent problems in patients recovering from anaesthesia with particularly high incidences being observed after remifentanil-isoflurane-based general anaesthesia. The opioid tramadol is generally effective in preventing shivering and treating pain, but its effects are not characterized after remifentanil-based general anaesthesia. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluated the effects of intraoperative intravenous tramadol on postoperative shivering and pain after remifentanil-based general anaesthesia.
After Ethics Committee approval, 60 patients scheduled for lumbar disc surgery were included. Surgery was performed under general anaesthesia (remifentanil, isoflurane). Patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 mg kg(-1) tramadol in 30 mL 0.9% saline infused intravenously (n = 30) or 30 mL saline (n = 30) 45-30 min before skin closure. The following parameters were assessed every 10 min for 2 h: shivering, pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, sedation, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of shivering during the first 2 postoperative hours. Secondary variables were: shivering intensity, pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, sedation, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation.
Shivering was less frequent in patients treated with tramadol (20% vs. 70%, P = 0.0009) and was of lower intensity (severe shivering: 10% vs. 46.7%, P = 0.003). Pain scores were similar between the groups and all other secondary outcome variables failed to reveal significant differences.
Compared with placebo, intraoperative intravenous administration of 2 mg kg(-1) tramadol reduces the incidence and extent of postoperative shivering without alterations in pain perception after lumbar disc surgery under remifentanil-isoflurane-based general anaesthesia.
We have characterized the human gene SLC39A4, which encodes a protein with features characteristic of a ZIP zinc transporter. The chromosomal location and expression of SLC39A4, together with mutational analysis of eight families affected with acrodermatitis enteropathica, suggest that SLC39A4 is centrally involved in the pathogenesis of this condition.
K-Ras mutations predict resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies. Because combinations of anti-EGFR with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy are promising treatments, we analyzed the effect of K-Ras mutations in patients having received exclusive 5-FU therapy.
This study was conducted on 93 stage IV colorectal cancer patients with unresectable measurable liver metastasis receiving 5-FU-leucovorin (56 men and 37 women; 77 cancer deaths). Liver metastases (n = 93) along with primary tumors (n = 48) were analyzed for K-Ras mutations (codons 12 and 13), p53 mutations (exons 4-9), p53 polymorphism (codon 72), thymidylate synthase (TS) polymorphism (28-bp repeats including G>C mutation), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism (677C>T, 1298A>C), thymidylate synthase (TS) activity, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase activity, folylpolyglutamate synthase activity, and p53 protein expression.
Thirty-six of 93 (38.7%) metastases were K-Ras mutated (30 at codon 12 and 6 at codon 13). Mutated primary tumors (16 of 48) matched perfectly with mutated metastases. The additional analyzed tumor markers were not different between K-Ras mutated and wild-type tumors. The objective response rate was 37%: 44.4% in K-Ras mutated versus 32.1% in wild-type K-Ras metastasis (P = 0.27). Low TS activity in metastasis was the only significant predictor of tumor response (P = 0.047). K-Ras status did not influence specific survival.
The present data indicate a perfect concordance of K-Ras mutations between primary and liver metastasis and suggest that any predictive and/or prognostic value of K-Ras mutations in treatments combining anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies with 5-FU should be exclusively linked to the anti-EGFR agent.
In order to study the incidence and course of nephrocalcinosis in full-term infants with congestive heart failure receiving long-term furosemide treatment, 36 such infants (median age 2.9 months, range 1.2-8.0) and 36 full-term control infants not receiving any diuretics (median age 3.4 months, range 1.1-8.4) were studied by renal ultrasonography and random urine calcium variables. The infants with nephrocalcinosis were followed at 3-6 month intervals up to 2 years of age, or until ultrasonic resolution. Nephrocalcinosis was found in 5 out of the 36 (14%) treated infants, but in none of the controls (P = 0.03). The dose of furosemide was higher in the infants with nephrocalcinosis than in those without (1.9+/-0.6 vs. 1.3+/-0.4 mg/kg per day; P = 0.01). The urinary calcium concentration was higher in the infants receiving furosemide than in controls and a similar trend was observed in the urinary calcium/creatinine ratio, but these variables did not differ between the study infants with and without nephrocalcinosis. Ultrasonic resolution of nephrocalcinosis was observed in 3 of the 5 infants at 12 months, but in the other 2 the condition still persisted at 24 months.
Long-term furosemide treatment in full-term infants with congestive heart failure entails a considerable risk of developing nephrocalcinosis. Renal ultrasonography is warranted in these patients within a few months after initiation of the treatment and in the case of nephrocalcinosis alteration of the diuretic regimen is to be considered.
To compare two protocols of epidural administration of racemic methadone for postoperative analgesia (continuous infusion and intermittent bolus), focussing on plasma concentration, analgesic efficacy and side effects.
Ninety patients undergoing abdominal or lower-limb surgery were randomly assigned to two groups in a prospective double-blind design. The continuous infusion patients (n=60) received initial doses of 3 to 6 mg followed by 6 to 12 mg by continuous infusion over 24 hr. The bolus administration patients (n=30) received repeated boluses of 3 to 6 mg of racemic methadone every eight hours. Pain intensity was assessed on a visual analog scale. Amount of supplementary analgesia was recorded, as was the incidence of side effects. Plasma methadone concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Treatment was continued for 72 hr.
Pain relief was good and comparable in both groups throughout the three days of treatment. No accumulation of plasma racemic methadone was observed in either group, although the concentrations were significantly higher in the bolus group. Miosis was significantly more frequent in the bolus group.
Plasma methadone concentrations were significantly lower with continuous infusion. Plasma methadone accumulation, which is considered the main disadvantage for its purported influence on the incidence of side effects, did not occur at the doses used over the three days of treatment that we report.
Cyclophosphamide (CP) is an antineoplastic agent that is used for the treatment of many neoplastic diseases. Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a major dose limiting side effect of CP. Recent studies show that aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase is a potent antioxidant and prevents changes caused by oxidative stress such as depletion of antioxidant activity and tissue injury. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of aminoguanidine on parameters of oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes and bladder injury caused by CP. Adult male rats were randomly divided into four groups. Control rats were administered saline; the AG control group received 200 mg/kg body wt of aminoguanidine; The CP group received a single injection of CP at the dose of 150 mg/kg body wt intraperitoneally. The CP + AG group received aminoguanidine (200 mg/kg body wt) intraperitoneally 1 h before the administration of CP. The rats were sacrificed 16 h after CP/saline administration. The bladder was used for light microscopic studies and biochemical studies. The markers of oxidative damage including protein carbonyl content, protein thiol, malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes were assayed in the homogenates along with the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione reductase and glutathione S transferase. In the bladders of CP treated rats edema of lamina propria with epithelial and sub-epithelial hemorrhage was seen. All the parameters of oxidative stress that were studied were significantly elevated in the bladders of CP treated rats. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes were significantly lowered in the bladders of CP treated rats. Aminoguanidine pretreatment prevented CP-induced oxidative stress, decrease in the activities of anti-oxidant enzymes and reduced bladder damage. The results of the present study suggest the antioxidant role for aminoguanidine in CP-induced bladder damage.
The side-effects of prochlorperazine (CompazineR StemetilR) were traced in thirty-six children up to the age of sixteen years and compared with those collected from literature. These side-effects appeared to be predominantly neurological and were independent of the dosage. Impaired consciousness, dyskinesia, pyramidal signs and hypertonus were the main neurological manifestations. Dyskinesia was the most frequent sign. These side-effects disappear spontaneously after discontinuation of the drug. Instant cure can be acquired by intra-muscular administration of orphenadrine (DisipalR).
Neuropathic pain accompanies peripheral nerve injury after a wide variety of insults including metabolic disorders, traumatic nerve injury, and neurotoxic drugs. Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, caused by drugs such as vincristine and taxol, occurs in cancer patients who receive these drugs as antineoplastic agents. Although a variety of remediations have been attempted, the absence of knowledge concerning mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain has hindered the development of treatment strategies. Vincristine, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, produces painful peripheral neuropathy in humans and mechanical hyperalgesia in rats. To test the hypothesis that alterations in C-fiber nociceptor function occur during vincristine-induced painful peripheral neuropathy, we performed in vivo extracellular recordings of single neurons from the saphenous nerve of vincristine-treated rats. Forty-one percent of C-fiber nociceptors were significantly hyper-responsive to suprathreshold mechanical stimulation. As a population, these mechanically hyper-responsive nociceptors also had significantly greater responses to suprathreshold heat stimulation; however, heat hyper-responsiveness was found only in a subset of these nociceptors and was never detected in the absence of mechanical hyper-responsiveness. In addition, mean conduction velocities of A-fibers and C-fibers in vincristine-treated rats were significantly slowed. Mean heat and mechanical activation thresholds of C-fiber nociceptors, their distribution among subclasses, and the percentage of spontaneously active neurons in vincristine-treated rats were not statistically different from controls. Vincristine does not, therefore, cause generalized impairment of C-fiber nociceptor function but rather specifically interferes with mechanisms underlying responsiveness to suprathreshold stimuli. Furthermore, vincristine-induced nociceptor hyper-responsiveness may involve alterations specifically in mechanotransduction in some nociceptors and alterations in general cellular adaptation mechanisms in others.
Drug-induced nephrolithiasis is a rare finding, especially with beta-lactamins. We report a case of acute renal failure due to amoxicillin crystallization.
A 48 year-old woman was admitted because of pneumococcal meningitis. After 4 days on high-dose amoxicillin (320 mg/kg/day), she developed acute oliguric renal failure and amoxicillin crystallization was documented by infrared spectrometry. The outcome was favorable after amoxicillin dosage tapering, together with one single hemodialysis session and further hydratation.
Amoxicillin is mainly excreted in the urine in its unchanged form. The risk of crystalluria is increased by low urinary pH, low urine output and high-dose of the drug. Such a crystalluria should be accurately identified by infrared spectrometry.
Etodolac (E), is a non-narcotic analgesic and antiinflammatory drug. A biodegradable polymer dextran has been utilized as a carrier for synthesis of etodolac-dextran conjugates (ED) to improve its aqueous solubility and reduce gastrointestinal side effects. An activated moiety, i.e. N-acylimidazole derivative of etodolac (EAI), was condensed with the polysaccharide polymer dextran of different molecular weights (40000, 60000, 110000 and 200000). IR spectral data confirmed formation of ester bonding in the conjugates. Etodolac contents were evaluated by UV-spectrophotometric analysis. The molecular weights were determined by measuring viscosity using the Mark-Howink-Sakurada equation. In vitro hydrolysis of ED was done in aqueous buffers (pH 1.2, 7.4, 9) and in 80% (v/v) human plasma (pH 7.4). At pH 9, a higher rate of etodolac release from ED was observed as compared to aqueous buffer of pH 7.4 and 80% human plasma (pH 7.4), following first-order kinetics. In vivo investigations were performed in animals. Acute analgesic and antiinflammatory activities were ascertained using acetic acid induced writhing model (mice) and carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model, respectively. In comparison to control, E and ED1-ED4 showed highly significant analgesic and antiinflammatory activities (p <0.001). Biological evaluation suggested that conjugates (ED1-ED4) retained comparable analgesic and antiinflammatory activities with remarkably reduced ulcerogenicity as compared to their parent drug--etodolac.
