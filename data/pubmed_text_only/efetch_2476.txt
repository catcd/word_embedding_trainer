The Hox genes are an evolutionarily conserved family of genes, which encode a class of important transcription factors that function in numerous developmental processes. Following their initial discovery, a substantial amount of information has been gained regarding the roles Hox genes play in various physiologic and pathologic processes. These processes range from a central role in anterior-posterior patterning of the developing embryo to roles in oncogenesis that are yet to be fully elucidated. In vertebrates there are a total of 39 Hox genes divided into 4 separate clusters. Of these, mutations in 10 Hox genes have been found to cause human disorders with significant variation in their inheritance patterns, penetrance, expressivity and mechanism of pathogenesis. This review aims to describe the various phenotypes caused by germline mutation in these 10 Hox genes that cause a human phenotype, with specific emphasis paid to the genotypic and phenotypic differences between allelic disorders. As clinical whole exome and genome sequencing is increasingly utilized in the future, we predict that additional Hox gene mutations will likely be identified to cause distinct human phenotypes. As the known human phenotypes closely resemble gene-specific murine models, we also review the homozygous loss-of-function mouse phenotypes for the 29 Hox genes without a known human disease. This review will aid clinicians in identifying and caring for patients affected with a known Hox gene disorder and help recognize the potential for novel mutations in patients with phenotypes informed by mouse knockout studies.
PEG-rHuMGDF administered to normal mice is a lineage-specific growth factor for megakaryocytes and platelets as judged by morphologic examination of hematologic cells in marrow and peripheral blood smears. The purpose of this study was to document that PEG-rHuMGDF in myelosuppressed mice promotes multilineage hematopoietic recovery. High-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in mice results in profound myelosuppression and 0-30% survival. Mice receiving a single dose of PEG-rHuMGDF (1000 microg/kg) 1 day after 5-FU (225 mg/kg) demonstrate an increased survival (76% vs 27% in control mice at 14 days). Compared to surviving controls, PEG-rHuMGDF-treated mice not only show the expected higher platelet counts, but also increased marrow colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage, increased multilineage marrow cellularity, and increased neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood. PEG-rHuMGDF- and vehicle-treated mice both develop hepatic abscesses after 5-FU treatment, but the abscesses in the PEG-rHuMGDF-treated mice contain more neutrophils, suggesting that myeloid reconstitution contributes to their survival. Furthermore, survival in 5-FU-treated mice is significantly improved by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and antibiotics, suggesting that infection rather than thrombocytopenia is the predominant cause of death. PEG-rHuMGDF after 5-FU promotes survival accompanied by accelerated lymphohematopoietic repopulation, suggesting that PEG-rHuMGDF, a lineage-specific thrombopoietic factor in normal mice, promotes multilineage hematopoietic recovery in myelosuppressed mice.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HIT/T) syndrome is usually triggered by an immune response after repeated administration of heparin. The syndrome is strongly associated with limb deep vein thrombosis and is potentially life-threatening if unrecognized. We describe the case of a patient with compartment syndrome of the left forearm complicated by HIT/T that developed after Port-A-Cath implantation through the left subclavian vein. Prompt recognition of HIT/T, immediate withdrawal of heparin, and timely institution of thrombolytic therapy successfully prevented limb loss.
We report a case of an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy involving salazosulphapyridine in a slow-acetylator patient with ulcerative colitis. Rather than hypersensitivity the mechanism of the neuropathy can be assumed to be toxicity. The role played by the respective different metabolites in the occurrence of this uncommon side effect is uncertain.
The goal of this study was to determine the role of nitric oxide in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. We examined the microcirculation of the cerebrum in vivo. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by the formation of venular leaky sites and clearance of fluorescent-labeled albumin (FITC-albumin) before and during phenylephrine-induced acute hypertension. We compared disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension in untreated rats and in rats treated for 1 h with topical application of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 100 microM) or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 100 microM). Under control conditions, no venular leaky sites were visible and clearance of FITC-albumin was minimal in untreated rats and in rats treated with topical application of nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. Phenylephrine (20 micrograms/kg/min for 5 min) infusion increased systemic arterial pressure by a similar magnitude in all groups of rats and produced disruption of the blood-brain barrier in venules. However, the magnitude of disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension was significantly less in rats treated with L-NMMA (52% reduction in the clearance of FITC-albumin) and L-NAME (47% reduction in clearance of FITC-albumin). The findings of the present study suggest that synthesis/release of nitric oxide contributes to disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension.
Amplification of the HER-2/neu and topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) genes has been linked to the effects of anthracyclines. Their role in predicting the outcome of anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients has remained controversial.
The present substudy of the Scandinavian Breast Group trial 9401, in which an epirubicin-based regimen (nine courses of tailored and dose-escalated fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide [FEC]) was compared with three or four courses of standard FEC followed by bone marrow-supported high-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin), included high-risk breast cancer patients (with eight or more positive axillary lymph nodes or at least five nodes with additional poor prognostic indicators). Amplification of HER-2/neu was determined retrospectively in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections by chromogenic in situ hybridization. TOP2A was tested only in HER-2/neu-amplified tumors.
HER-2/neu amplification alone, which was present in 32.7% of the tumors, was a strong prognostic factor for short relapse-free (P = .0034) and overall survival (P = .0008) but showed no direct association with treatment assignment. TOP2A coamplification, which was present in 37% of HER-2/neu-amplified tumors, was associated with better relapse-free survival in patients treated with tailored and dose-escalated FEC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.45; P = .049). A statistical multivariate Cox's regression analysis confirmed the predictive significance of TOP2A coamplification (HR = 0.30; P = .020) in HER-2/neu-amplified tumors. There was no such association in patients with HER-2/neu-amplified tumors without TOP2A gene amplification.
Coamplification of HER-2/neu and TOP2A may define a subgroup of high-risk breast cancer patients who benefit from individually tailored and dose-escalated adjuvant anthracyclines.
The sigma(1) (sigma(1)) receptor exerts a potent neuromodulatory role in the brain with relevant consequences in memory processes, response to stress, depression and pharmacodependence. Its precise endogenous ligand is not yet identified but the sigma(1) receptor appears to be one target for the nongenomic rapid effects of neuroactive steroids in the brain. The aim of the present study was to establish whether differences in sigma(1) receptor-mediated behaviours could be observed among mouse strains, in relation with differences in either sigma(1) receptor expression or steroid levels. The sigma(1)-receptor immunohistochemical distribution appeared similar between Swiss and C57BL/6 strains in all the brain structures examined. The levels of in vivo [(3)H](+)-SKF-10 047 binding to sigma(1) receptors were lower in Swiss than in C57BL/6. Adrenalectomy/castration significantly increased [(3)H](+)-SKF-10 047 binding only in Swiss. The behavioural efficacy of the selective sigma( 1) agonists igmesine and PRE-084 -- reversion of the scopolamine-induced amnesia in the passive avoidance test; diminution of the immobility duration in the forced swimming test -- were significantly higher in C57BL/6 than in Swiss. Steroid levels were measured in the brain in basal conditions and after stress. C57BL/6 mice presented in both conditions, the lowest progesterone levels, this steroid acting as an endogenous sigma(1) antagonist. Collectively, the results suggested that strain differences in neuroactive steroid and particularly, progesterone, biosynthesis and sensitivity may contribute to the differential behavioural efficacy of sigma(1)-receptor ligands. Noteworthy, these observations are coherent with strain differences observed in the intensity of cocaine-induced reward properties, known to critically involve the sigma(1) receptor.
The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of gastric mucosal injury induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on 100 RA patients treated with NSAIDs. Patient factors potentially contributing to the development of NSAID-induced gastric mucosal injury were identified by logistic regression analysis; gastric mucosal injury and ulcers were used as objective variables. Gastric mucosal injury was detected in 62 of 100 patients, and eight of these patients had ulcers. Previous history of ulcers, lifestyle, NSAID dosage, and body mass index were associated with the development of gastric mucosal injury,and the use of diclofenac and steroid dose were associated with the development of ulcers. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) did not appear to influence the risk of NSAID-induced gastric mucosal injury. RA patients treated for long periods with NSAIDs for RA symptoms should be controlled with DMARDs, without consideration of increased doses of steroids, in terms of risk for NSAID-induced gastric mucosal injury. Simultaneously, concomitant use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) such as famotidine should be considered.
In 984 patients with generalized anxiety disorder who received buspirone in double-blind studies, the incidence of drowsiness (9 percent) did not differ significantly from that (10 percent) reported in 334 patients who received placebo. A probability value of p less than or equal to 0.10 was the criterion for significance. The incidence of drowsiness in buspirone-treated patients was significantly less than that in each of the groups receiving diazepam (32 percent), clorazepate (26 percent), lorazepam (58 percent), or alprazolam (43 percent). The side effects that did occur significantly more frequently in the buspirone group than in the placebo group were dizziness (9 percent versus 2 percent), headache (7 percent versus 2 percent), nervousness (4 percent versus 1 percent), light-headedness (4 percent versus less than 1 percent), diarrhea (3 percent versus less than 1 percent), paresthesia (2 percent versus less than 1 percent), excitation (2 percent versus less than 1 percent), and sweating/clamminess (1 percent versus 0 percent). The severities of these effects were predominantly rated as only mild or moderate. Fatigue occurred less frequently in buspirone-treated patients than in those receiving any of the benzodiazepines, and weakness occurred more frequently in diazepam-treated patients. Depression occurred less frequently in buspirone-treated patients than in those receiving clorazepate, diazepam, or lorazepam. Impotence occurred only in clorazepate- and lorazepam-treated patients. Decreased libido occurred more frequently in diazepam-treated patients, whereas increased libido was more frequent in clorazepate-treated patients. Nausea was reported more frequently in buspirone-treated patients than in those receiving clorazepate, diazepam, or alprazolam; diarrhea occurred more frequently in the buspirone group than in the diazepam group. The mean daily doses of the various treatments were buspirone, 20 mg; diazepam, 20 mg; clorazepate, 24 mg; lorazepam, 3 mg; and alprazolam, 1.5 mg. In an open-field study in West Germany involving 5,414 patients, gastrointestinal-related complaints were the most frequently reported side effects.
Pyruvic acid semi- and thiosemicarbazones (1 and 2, respectively) were tested as inhibitors of bacterial, fungal, experimental tumour and plant cell growth. 1 and 2 displayed a growth-inhibitory effect in vitro against different bacterial strains, and especially against St. aureus mutant UV-2 and S. lutea. The compounds proved to have low activity in vivo against L 1210 and P 388 leukemia, adenocarcinoma 755 and melanoma B 16. 2 inhibited strongly the growth of cultured cells of Lycopersicon esculentum (100% inhibition at a concentration of 1,5 mumol/ml) while 1 was not active.
Contrary to an earlier report by Coxon, scoline pain occurs in African negroes. Its incidence was determined in a prospective study involving a total of 100 Nigerian patients (50 out-patients and 50 in-patients). About 62% of the out-patients developed scoline pain as compared with about 26% among the in-patients. The abolition of muscle fasciculations (by 0.075mg/kg dose of Fazadinium) did not influence the occurrence of scoline pain. Neither the type of induction agent (Althesin or Thiopentone) nor the salt preparation of suxamethonium used (chloride or bromide), affected the incidence of scoline pain.
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between changes in IL-1β expression and intestinal apoptosis after chemotherapy. And we further determine whether interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) reduces apoptosis in vivo after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy in the small intestine.
Intestinal mucositis was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of 5-FU (200 mg/kg). IL-1Ra (1 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously twice daily after 5-FU injection. 5-FU-induced intestinal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. The expression of IL-1β induced by 5-FU in local intestinal tissue was examined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Assessment of 5-FU-induced mucositis (histology, diarrhea scores, bowel weight) was performed. The apoptosis-related proteins were investigated by western blotting analysis. The proliferation of intestine was examined by immunohistological staining of PCNA. Viability of IEC-6 cells was determined using the CCK-8 assay. The apoptosis of IEC-6 cells was examined by Hoechst 33342 staining.
The variation of IL-1β expression induced by 5-FU was in accordance with the changes in intestinal apoptosis. Administration of IL-1Ra could block the destructive effect of IL-1β and reduce apoptosis in the small intestinal crypt after chemotherapy. The protection against apoptosis was in accordance with the reduction of the up-regulation of Bax and caspase 3 and the elimination of the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Moreover, IL-1Ra attenuated the severity of intestinal mucositis induced by 5-FU and enhanced intestinal crypt proliferation. In vitro experiments showed that IL-1Ra suppressed apoptosis and increased cell viability in enterocyte IEC-6 cells treated with 5-FU. Additionally, IL-1Ra did not affect the chemotherapeutic effect of 5-FU in tumor CT-26 xenograft mice.
Our studies elucidate that IL-1β is quite possibly involved in and mediated the course of intestinal apoptosis after 5-FU chemotherapy. Administered with IL-1Ra protects mice against intestinal apoptosis induced by 5-FU, relieves mucosal impairment of the small intestine, and facilitates the recovery of the intestinal mucosa. IL-1Ra treatment offers a novel promising strategy for the prevention and cure of chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis in clinical practice.
Retigabine is a novel anticonvulsant drug that not only augments gamma-aminobutyric acid mechanisms, but also opens voltage gated K+ channels (KCNQ). In this study we investigated the effects of retigabine on detrusor activity in rats.
To conscious, female Sprague-Dawley rats undergoing continuous cystometry retigabine was given intravenously (0.5, 1 and 5 mg/kg(-1)). The KCNQ channel blocker linopirdine was given intravenously (2 mg/kg(-1)) 5 minutes prior to retigabine (1 mg/kg(-1)). In addition, retigabine was given intracerebroventricularly (1, 5 and 10 microg) and intravesically (100, 500 and 1,000 ng ml(-1)). The effects of the drug (intravesical administration) on capsaicin induced bladder overactivity were also tested.
Retigabine given intravenously (1 mg/kg(-1)) decreased baseline and maximal bladder pressures, increased voided and infused volumes, and increased voiding intervals. Retigabine (10 microg) given intracerebroventricularly decreased baseline pressure and increased voided and infused volumes as well as voiding intervals. However, bladder pressures were not significantly affected. Intravesical retigabine (1,000 ng.ml(-1)) decreased maximal bladder pressure, increased voided and infused volumes, and increased voiding intervals. Given intravesically for 30 minutes prior to intravesical capsaicin (30 microM) instillation retigabine (1,000 ng.ml(-1)) decreased the detrusor overactivity induced by capsaicin. The KNCQ channel blocker linopirdine (2 mg/kg(-1)) completely blocked the effects of intravenous retigabine (1 mg/kg(-1)).
Retigabine given intravenously, intracerebroventricularly and intravesically increased micturition volume and voiding intervals and, when given intravesically, it decreased capsaicin induced detrusor overactivity, suggesting that KCNQ channels can be interesting targets for drugs aiming at micturition control. Retigabine may be a candidate to test as a treatment for detrusor overactivity in humans.
Two multiple myeloma patients relapsed after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Conventional chemotherapy, including thalidomide, showed very little effect, but both patients responded well to a standard dose of bortezomib. One patient was treated with two additional cycles of bortezomib, but his clinical course suddenly deteriorated. Unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) with reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) was performed in refractory disease. After CBT, the clinical course was aggravated by tumor lysis syndrome and other conditions, thus resulting in patient death on day 34. Thereafter, we administered CBT with RIC on the second patient after just one course of bortezomib therapy since she was in partial remission. The second patient developed acute and chronic GVHD, and both responded to the steroid therapy. She has been in complete remission for more than 48 months after CBT. These results suggested that the timing of CBT with RIC may be very important, and cytoreduction with not only ASCT but also bortezomib could give a promising chance for a successful CBT.
Using a mouse embryo bioassay, we examined the embryotoxic properties of serum obtained from eight women who had ingested cocaine base paste (CBP) for a period of 1-3 years.
Two-cell stage mouse embryos were cultured in the presence of serum extracted from eight CBP-smoking or control women. After 48h, embryos were evaluated to determine their developmental stage and then processed by Tarkoswki's technique to determine the proportion of embryos with micronuclei, in order to establish the number of micronuclei/embryo.
Serum from CBP patients diminished the percentage of embryos progressing to the compacted morula stage, while increasing the proportion of embryos with micronuclei and the corresponding micronuclei/embryo ratio.
These findings provide the first experimental evidence of embryotoxic compounds in the serum of CBP-smoking women. This study highlights the reproductive risk of chronically ingested CBP and demonstrates the need for further studies.
Exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) improves tissue perfusion in large animals and humans with chronic myocardial ischemia. Because tissue perfusion is mainly dependent on the arteriolar tree, we hypothesized that the neovascularizing effect of VEGF should include arteriogenesis, an effect not as yet described in large mammalian models of myocardial ischemia. In the present study we investigated the effect of intramyocardial plasmid-mediated human VEGF(165) gene transfer (pVEGF(165)) on the proliferation of vessels with smooth muscle in a pig model of myocardial ischemia. In addition, we assessed the effect of treatment on capillary growth, myocardial perfusion, myocardial function and collateralization. Three weeks after positioning of an Ameroid constrictor (Research Instruments SW, Escondido, CA) in the left circumflex artery, pigs underwent basal perfusion (single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT] with (99m)Tc-sestamibi) and regional function (echocardiography) studies at rest and under dobutamine stress, and were then randomly assigned to receive transepicardial injection of pVEGF(165) 3.8 mg (n = 8) or placebo (empty plasmid, n = 8). All experimental steps and data analysis were done in a blinded fashion. Five weeks later, pVEGF(165)-treated pigs showed a significantly higher density of small (8-50 microm in diameter) vessels with smooth muscle, higher density of capillaries, and improved myocardial perfusion. These results indicate an arteriogenic effect of VEGF in a large mammalian model of myocardial ischemia and encourage the use of VEGF to promote arteriolar growth in patients with severe coronary artery disease.
Clinical studies have demonstrated an excess of transition metals, including zinc and iron, in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's patients. In the present study, the neurotoxic effect of zinc was investigated using iron as a positive control. Addition of zinc or iron to brain homogenates increased lipid peroxidation. Zinc was less potent than iron in inducing lipid peroxidation. Coincubation with desferrioxamine prevented zinc- and iron-induced lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, glutathione (GSH), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, or melatonin inhibited zinc-induced lipid peroxidation. The oxidative effect of zinc was further investigated in anesthetized rats. Seven days after intranigral infusion of zinc, lipid peroxidation was elevated in the infused SN, and dopamine content and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive axons were decreased in the ipsilateral striatum. Zinc was less potent than iron in inducing neurodegeneration in vivo. L-Buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine pretreatment (i.c.v.), which depletes cellular GSH levels, enhanced zinc-induced oxidative injuries in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Moreover, simultaneous infusion of zinc and iron appeared to augment oxidative injuries in rat brain. Taken together, our results demonstrate that intranigral infusion of zinc caused degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in rat brain. Furthermore, coexistence of zinc and iron augmented oxidative injuries in rat brain. These findings indicate that both zinc and iron contribute to the etiology of Parkinsonism.
In mouse, oral administration of the benzene extract of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis flowers at a dose level of 1 gm/kg body weight/day from day 5-8 of gestation led to termination of pregnancy in about 92% of the animals. The effect was associated with a significant fall in peripheral level of progesterone and increase in uterine acid phosphatase activity, as measured on day 10. The ovary exhibited signs of luteolysis, and the corpus luteal delta 5-3 beta -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity decreased markedly. The interceptive effect of the extract was prevented completely by exogenous progesterone (1 mg/mouse/day) or chorionic gonadotropin (1 I.U./mouse/day) and partially (62.5%) by exogenous prolactin (500 micrograms/mouse/day). In unilaterally pregnant mouse having trauma-induced deciduomata in the sterile horn, the extract caused resorption of the fetuses, and regression of the deciduomata accompanied by reduction in weight of the ovaries. Luteolysis, may be due to interference with the luteotropic influence, and a consequent fall in plasma level of progesterone have been suggested as the plausible cause of termination of pregnancy.
Podosome-type adhesions are actin-based membrane protrusions involved in cell-matrix adhesion and extracellular matrix degradation. Despite growing knowledge of many proteins associated with podosome-type adhesions, much remains unknown concerning the function of podosomal proteins at the level of the whole animal. In this study, the spontaneous mouse mutant nee was used to identify a component of podosome-type adhesions that is essential for normal postnatal growth and development. Mice homozygous for the nee allele exhibited runted growth, craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities, ocular anterior segment dysgenesis, and hearing impairment. Adults also exhibited infertility and a form of lipodystrophy. Using genetic mapping and DNA sequencing, the cause of nee phenotypes was identified as a 1-bp deletion within the Sh3pxd2b gene on mouse Chromosome 11. Whereas the wild-type Sh3pxd2b gene is predicted to encode a protein with one PX domain and four SH3 domains, the nee mutation is predicted to cause a frameshift and a protein truncation altering a portion of the third SH3 domain and deleting all of the fourth SH3 domain. The SH3PXD2B protein is believed to be an important component of podosomes likely to mediate protein-protein interactions with membrane-spanning metalloproteinases. Testing this directly, SH3PXD2B localized to podosomes in constitutively active Src-transfected fibroblasts and through its last SH3 domain associated with a transmembrane member of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase family of proteins, ADAM15. These results identify SH3PXD2B as a podosomal-adaptor protein required for postnatal growth and development, particularly within physiologic contexts involving extracellular matrix regulation.
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system plays an important role in regulating ovarian follicular development and steroidogenesis. IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) mostly inhibit IGF actions, and IGFBP proteolysis is a major mechanism for regulating IGF bioavailability. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPPA) is a secreted metalloprotease responsible for cleavage of IGFBP4 in the ovary. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PAPPA plays a role in regulating ovarian functions and female fertility by comparing the reproductive phenotype of wild-type (WT) mice with mice heterozygous or homozygous for a targeted Pappa gene deletion (heterozygous and PAPP-A knockout [KO] mice, respectively). When mated with WT males, PAPP-A KO females demonstrated an overall reduction in average litter size. PAPP-A KO mice had a reduced number of ovulated oocytes, lower serum estradiol levels following equine chorionic gonadotropin administration, lower serum progesterone levels after human chorionic gonadotropin injection, and reduced expression of ovarian steroidogenic enzyme genes, compared to WT controls. In PAPP-A KO mice, inhibitory IGFBP2, IGFBP3, and IGFBP4 ovarian gene expression was reduced postgonadotropin stimulation, suggesting some compensation within the ovarian IGF system. Expression levels of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, luteinizing hormone receptor, and genes required for cumulus expansion were not affected. Analysis of preovulatory follicular fluid showed complete loss of IGFBP4 proteolytic activity in PAPP-A KO mice, demonstrating no compensation for loss of PAPPA proteolytic activity by other IGFBP proteases in vivo in the mouse ovary. Taken together, these data demonstrate an important role of PAPPA in modulating ovarian function and female fertility by control of the bioavailability of ovarian IGF.
We examined the effect of KRP-297, a new thiazolidinedione derivative, on glucose uptake in the soleus muscle of two animal models of insulin resistance that show moderate (ob/ob mice) and severe (db/db mice) hyperglycemia. Insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake in soleus muscle was 53.8% lower in ob/ob mice versus lean mice (P < .05). When administered to ob/ob mice, KRP-297 (0.3 to 10 mg/kg) decreased plasma glucose and insulin levels and improved the impaired insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake in soleus muscle in a dose-dependent manner. Soleus muscle from db/db mice exhibited defects in both basal (35.0% decrease, P < .01) and insulin-stimulated (50.5% decrease, P < .01) 2DG uptake. These defects were improved by treatment with KRP-297 (0.3 to 10 mg/kg). Moreover, KRP-297 prevented severe hyperglycemia and the marked decrease in pancreatic insulin content in db/db mice. These results suggest that KRP-297 treatment is useful to prevent the development of diabetic syndromes in addition to ameliorating the impaired glucose transport in skeletal muscle.
The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of olanzapine, clozapine, and haloperidol on neurocognitive function in schizophrenic patients who present with documented episodes of physical aggression and to determine whether change in cognitive function is related to aggression. One hundred physically aggressive schizophrenic inpatients were assigned to a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week treatment, and received cognitive evaluations at baseline. There were 33, 34, and 33 subjects in the clozapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol groups, respectively. They were administered a battery of tests assessing psychomotor function, general executive function, visual and verbal memory, and visuospatial ability. A general cognitive index was derived from the above battery. The overall score on the Modified Overt Aggression Scale was used to measure the number and severity of the aggressive events. Psychiatric symptoms and side effects were also assessed. The improvement in the general cognitive index differed significantly among the 3 treatment groups, with olanzapine being superior to both haloperidol and clozapine. Further analyses revealed significantly greater improvement with olanzapine in several cognitive domains. Furthermore, improvement in the general cognitive index was significantly associated with a decrease in aggression in the olanzapine group but not in the other 2 medication groups. In violent schizophrenic patients, olanzapine treatment is associated with better cognitive functioning relative to haloperidol and clozapine. This improvement in neurocognitive function is associated with a decrease in aggressive behavior. As clozapine markedly reduced aggression, there may be different pathways for the antiaggressive effect of olanzapine and that of clozapine.
Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits wild-type hepatitis B virus (HBV) and lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ADV against lamivudine-resistant mutants and of adefovir and interferon (IFN) add-on to lamivudine for patients with severe acute exacerbation of hepatitis caused by lamivudine-resistant mutants.
Fourteen patients with breakthrough hepatitis were treated with ADV. Four of the 14 patients also received IFN as combined treatment for severe acute exacerbation of hepatitis.
At week 24, serum HBV DNA levels had significantly decreased by a median of over 4.8 log copies/ml in the ADV group and over 5.9 log copies/ml in the ADV + IFN group compared to baseline. The median decrease in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels from baseline to week 24 was -1.05 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in the ADV group [significant at week 24 compared with baseline (p = 0.012)] and -22.3 times the ULN in the ADV + IFN group.
Administration of ADV add-on to lamivudine for patients with breakthrough hepatitis reduced HBV DNA and ALT levels. ADV and IFN add-on to lamivudine could prevent a fatal course in patients with severe acute exacerbation of hepatitis.
