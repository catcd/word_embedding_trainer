We compared the effect of the renal nerves on renal function, plasma renin activity, and renal renin and angiotensinogen mRNA contents in Wistar rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, the left kidney was exposed, its nerves were sectioned, the ureter was cannulated, and a flow probe was placed on the renal artery. The renal nerves were stimulated for 1 hour to reduce renal blood flow by 15% and 30%, after which blood was removed for measurement of plasma renin activity, and kidneys were analyzed for renal renin and angiotensinogen mRNA. Frequency-related reductions in filtration rate were similar, from 15% to 50%, as was sodium excretion, from 30% to 70%, in both SHR and Wistar rats. Basal plasma renin activity and responses to nerve stimulation in SHR were approximately half those of Wistar rats (all P < .001). SHR renal renin mRNA concentrations were approximately three quarters those of Wistar rats and were unchanged by either low- or high-level renal nerve stimulation, whereas the higher rate increased renin mRNA approximately threefold (P < .05) in the Wistar rats. SHR renal angiotensinogen mRNA was one quarter that of the Wistar rats and was unaffected by nerve stimulation, whereas in the Wistar rats it was increased threefold (P < .05) by the low but not high level of nerve stimulation. These findings show that whereas the renal nerves are able to modulate hemodynamic and tubular functions relatively normally in SHR, their ability to increase renin release, renal renin, and angiotensinogen mRNA levels is depressed.
To explore the efficacy of anti-viral drug in combination with immunoregulatory agent in treatment of chronic hepatitis B.
Totally 98 patients with chronic hepatitis B were divided at random into 3 groups. In groups A (42 cases) lamivudine was used in combination with thymopentin to treat chronic hepatitis B. Lamivudine or thymopentin was used alone in groups B (38 cases) and C (18 cases), respectively. The dynamic changes in serum parameters reflecting HBV replication and liver function were observed.
At the end of the treatments, the rates of negative conversion of HBeA g and positive conversion of anti-HBe in the serum were significantly higher in group A than in group B (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between group A and group C (P>0.05). The rate of negative conversion of HBV DNA was markedly higher in group A than in group C (P<0.05). However, there was no remarkable difference between group A and group B (P>0.05). The changes in parameters of viral replication in 6 and 12 months after the treatments were not significantly different from those at the end of the treatments. The effective rate and total effective rate were markedly higher in group A than in the ther 2 groups. Meanwhile, the rate of ALT normalization of remained higher than 85% in group A.
Lamivudine in combination with thymopentin can exert great and lasting effects on HBV and is effective in normalization of ALT.
A 83-year-old patient had been treated for pityriasis rubra pilaris with 70 mg etretinate daily. He developed acute renal impairment, with creatinine levels reaching 73 mg/l on day 7. After discontinuation of etretinate, all biological changes were reversible. Although renal impairment is not considered as retinoid side effect, the chronology of renal changes is very suggestive of etretinate responsibility.
Lamivudine is a potent inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effectiveness of lamivudine for the treatment of HBV reactivation with or without fulminant hepatic failure in renal transplant recipients. Forty-two renal transplant recipients (30 men, 12 women) were enrolled onto this study. Eight patients presented with HBV reactivation without fulminant hepatic failure and were administered lamivudine (group I), 5 patients presented with HBV and hepatic failure and were administered lamivudine (group II), 5 patients presented with HBV and hepatic failure but were not administered lamivudine (group III), and 24 patients were asymptomatic HBV carriers who were not administered lamivudine (group IV). Lamivudine was administered at a dose of 100 or 150 mg once daily. A greater prevalence of recent use of a combination of antilymphocyte immunoglobulin (ALG) and methylprednisolone (MP) occurred in patients with hepatic failure (groups II and III) than those without hepatic failure (30% versus 6.3%; P = 0.043). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of MP use alone (20% versus 25%; P = 0.746). Mortality rates for groups I, II, and III were significantly different (12.5%, 40%, 100%; P = 0.008). One patient in group I died of sepsis without evidence of HBV DNA, even in the terminal event. In group II, 3 of 5 patients (60%) were rescued by lamivudine therapy. In group III, without lamivudine treatment, there was a 100% mortality rate despite intensive plasmapheresis. HBV DNA was not detectable after lamivudine treatment in 7 of 8 patients in group I and 3 of 5 patients in group II. Creatinine levels did not change significantly during lamivudine treatment. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion rates after lamivudine treatment were 7.7% and 37.5%, respectively. We conclude that ALG is a potent trigger of HBV-related fulminant hepatic failure in renal transplant recipients, whereas lamivudine is an effective and lifesaving treatment. Prompt use of lamivudine is recommended in renal transplant recipients with evidence of HBV reactivation to prevent catastrophic fulminant hepatic failure.
Cerebral hemorrhage associated with antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy in acute stroke continues to present a major clinical problem. Rupture of the cerebral microvasculature involves the degradation and remodeling of extracellular matrix. Here we demonstrated that the delayed administration of heparin 3 hours after photothrombotic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) caused cerebral hemorrhage in wild-type (WT) mice but not in tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-deficient knockout (KO) mice. Heparin administration increased tPA activity and its mRNA expression at 6 and 12 hours after MCAO in the ischemic hemispheres of WT mice. The expression of tPA was enhanced in microglial cells in the ischemic border zone. We also observed an exacerbation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 expression at the mRNA level and its conversion to an active form after heparin administration in the ischemic hemisphere in WT mice but not in tPA KO mice. The increased MMP 9 expression was localized in microglial cells and endothelial cells. These findings suggest that endogenous tPA, through the enhancement of MMP 9 expression and proteolytic activation, plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of heparin-produced cerebral hemorrhage. Targeting tPA, MMP 9, or both may provide a new approach for preventing cerebral hemorrhage associated with antithrombotic therapy for stroke in humans.
An account is given of chronic diphenyl hydantion (DPH) encephalopathy in 21 mentally retarded epileptics with increasing psychomotor deterioration, choreiform hyperkinesia, deposits of immunoglobulins in the skin, and changes in serum immunoglobulins. Three months after withdrawal of DPH the condition proved partially reversible, from the clinical as well as laboratory point of view. Eleven patients have been followed for 1 year after discontinuation of DPH, and the findings were largely unchanged from the 3-month follow-up examination. Before the drug was withdrawn, seven patients exhibited deposits of immunoglobulins at the dermo-epidermal junction and in vessel walls. At the end of 1 year such deposits were found in only three patients, all of whom were on another antiepileptic drug.
Ketanserin suppresses baroreflex-mediated tachycardia following the administration of hypotensive doses of sodium nitroprusside in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The purpose of this study was to compare the baroreflex effects of ketanserin with those of the more selective S2-serotonergic receptor antagonist ritanserin and the alpha 1-blocker prazosin. In conscious SHR, both ketanserin (3 mg/kg) and prazosin (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg) caused a significant reduction in blood pressure. Ritanserin (3 mg/kg) and the combination of a low dose of prazosin (0.01 mg/kg) and ritanserin (3 mg/kg) did not lower blood pressure significantly. Baroreflex responses were determined by measuring the maximal changes in heart period (HP = 60,000/HR) after administration of 20 to 100 micrograms/kg sodium nitroprusside. Whereas saline and prazosin lacked an effect on changes in HPmax, ketanserin reversed the decrease in delta HPmax into a significant increase. Ritanserin alone caused a slight but insignificant inhibition, whereas the combination of ritanserin and prazosin blocked the sodium nitroprusside-induced reflex tachycardia. Ritanserin, in contrast to prazosin or ketanserin, lowered resting heart rate values. We conclude that the interference of ketanserin with the baroreflex in SHR is a unique property of this agent, related to its simultaneous effects on serotonin (5-HT) S2-receptors and alpha 1-adrenoceptors.
The present microdialysis study was aimed at evaluating the anticonvulsant effect of the adenosine A(1) receptor agonist 2-chloroadenosine (2-CADO) against pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats. The hippocampal neurotransmitter modulation on the action of 2-CADO and its possible activation of hippocampal adenosine A(2a) receptors was also assessed. Intrahippocampal perfusion of 2-CADO (100 microM) produced a sustained attenuation of baseline dopamine levels, while eliciting a delayed augmentation of both glutamate and GABA efflux. When co-perfused with pilocarpine (10 mM) or injected systemically (7.5 mg/kg), 2-CADO prevented the development of seizures as well as pilocarpine-evoked augmentation of the glutamate and dopamine levels. However, the delayed increase in glutamate overflow with intrahippocampal 2-CADO was still observed. Intraperitoneal injection of selective adenosine A(2a) receptor antagonist SCH 58261 reversed the 2-CADO-elicited attenuation of pilocarpine-induced increment in dopamine efflux and completely abolished the delayed augmentation of glutamate levels, irrespective of perfusion with pilocarpine. Intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg 2-CADO mostly prevented the elevation of pilocarpine-induced glutamate efflux but could not confer adequate protection. We conclude that 2-CADO can prevent pilocarpine-induced seizures by both intrahippocampal perfusion and systemic administration. The attenuation of pilocarpine-induced dopamine efflux and the late elevations of glutamate are likely to be mediated by hippocampal A(2a) receptors. Inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release does not appear to be sufficient for the anticonvulsant action. Postsynaptic events could play a more important role.
Antipsychotic medications cause a wide range of adverse effects and have been associated with sudden death in psychiatric patients.
To supply power spectral analysis of heart rate variability as a tool to examine the arrythmogenic effects of neuroleptics.
Heart rate analysis was carried out in patients with schizophrenia on standard doses of neuroleptic monotherapy -- 21 were on clozapine, 18 on haloperidol and 17 on olanzapine -- and in 53 healthy subjects.
Patients with schizophrenia on clozapine had significantly higher heart rate, lower heart rate variability and lower high-frequency and higher low-frequency components compared with patients on haloperidol or olanzapine and matched control subjects. Prolonged QTc intervals were more common in patients than controls.
Patients treated with neuroleptic medications, especially clozapine, showed autonomic dysregulation and cardiac repolarisation changes. Physicians should be aware of this adverse reaction.
Methimazole, carbimazole, and propylthiouracil (PTU) are the mainstays of antithyroid drug therapy. Adverse effects of these drugs have been documented in less than 15% of patients undergoing treatment for hyperthyroidism. Common problems include fever, skin rash, urticaria, arthralgias, and arthritis. Vasculitis associated with antineutrophil anticytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) has been reported on several occasions following treatment with PTU. However, vasculitis rarely appears to be associated with carbimazole. We report the clinical history of a woman with a necrotizing glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage associated with carbimazole therapy.
Tacrolimus (FK 506) is a new, more powerful immunosuppressant and is more effective in the prevention and treatment of allograft rejection in humans than cyclosporine (CysA). The present study was conducted to determine whether FK 506 increases ET(A) receptor mRNA in blood vessels in rats. FK 506 5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks increased blood pressure and expression of ET(A) receptor mRNA in mesenteric arteries of Wistar-Kyoto rats. However, 0.5 mg/kg/day of FK 506 did not increase blood pressure or ET(A) mRNA levels in the vasculature. The dose of 0.1 microM CysA used in clinical practice induced expression of ET(A) receptor mRNA in cultured rat vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMCs). A clinical dose (0.01 microM) of FK 506 did not increase expression of ET(A) receptor mRNA in VSMCs. However, 0.1 microM FK 506 increased the levels of ET(A) receptor mRNA in VSMCs. These results indicate that the upregulating effect of FK 506 on the ET(A) receptor in the vasculature may contribute to the genesis of FK 506-induced hypertension. The lower incidence of complications seen with FK 506 may be due in part to its use at a lower clinical dose compared to that of CysA.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in developed countries. To identify common breast cancer susceptibility alleles, we conducted a genome-wide association study in which 582,886 SNPs were genotyped in 3,659 cases with a family history of the disease and 4,897 controls. Promising associations were evaluated in a second stage, comprising 12,576 cases and 12,223 controls. We identified five new susceptibility loci, on chromosomes 9, 10 and 11 (P = 4.6 x 10(-7) to P = 3.2 x 10(-15)). We also identified SNPs in the 6q25.1 (rs3757318, P = 2.9 x 10(-6)), 8q24 (rs1562430, P = 5.8 x 10(-7)) and LSP1 (rs909116, P = 7.3 x 10(-7)) regions that showed more significant association with risk than those reported previously. Previously identified breast cancer susceptibility loci were also found to show larger effect sizes in this study of familial breast cancer cases than in previous population-based studies, consistent with polygenic susceptibility to the disease.
Using data from a genome-wide association study of 907 individuals with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cases) and 2,398 controls and with validation in samples totaling 2,386 cases and 2,419 controls, we have shown that common variation at 9p21.3 (rs3731217, intron 1 of CDKN2A) influences acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk (odds ratio = 0.71, P = 3.01 x 10(-11)), irrespective of cell lineage.
Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer and almost 90% of lung cancer is due to cigarette smoking. Even though nicotine, one of the major ingredients of cigarette smoke and the causative agent for addiction, is not a carcinogen by itself, several investigators have shown that nicotine can induce cell proliferation and angiogenesis. We observed that the proliferative index of nicotine is different in the lung cancer cell lines H1299 (p53-/-) and A549 (p53+/+) which indicates that the mode of up-regulation of survival signals by nicotine might be different in cells with and without p53.
While low concentrations of nicotine induced activation of NF-κB, Akt, Bcl2, MAPKs, AP1 and IAPs in H1299, it failed to induce NF-κB in A549, and compared to H1299, almost 100 times higher concentration of nicotine was required to induce all other survival signals in A549. Transfection of WT-p53 and DN-p53 in H1299 and A549 respectively, reversed the mode of activation of survival signals. Curcumin down-regulated all the survival signals induced by nicotine in both the cells, irrespective of their p53 status. The hypothesis was confirmed when lower concentrations of nicotine induced NF-κB in two more lung cancer cells, Hop-92 and NCI-H522 with mutant p53 status. Silencing of p53 in A549 using siRNA made the cells susceptible to nicotine-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation as in A549 DN-p53 cells.
The present study reveals a detrimental role of nicotine especially in lung cancer patients with impaired p53 status and identifies curcumin as a potential chemopreventive.
One hundred seventy-one patients, 60 years of age or older with isolated systolic hypertension, were randomly assigned to receive chlorthalidone 12.5, 25.0, or 50.0 mg or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The majority of the patients receiving chlorthalidone 12.5 mg achieved therapeutic success with no clinically significant biochemical changes or side effects. The 50.0-mg dose level enhanced efficacy only minimally over the 25.0-mg dose level. Drug-related side effects were significantly more prevalent in the chlorthalidone 50.0-mg group than in the placebo group. The data suggest that most elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, regardless of the severity, could be treated effectively and safely with chlorthalidone 12.5 mg per day.
Intoxication with most anticonvulsants can produce asterixis. Asterixis rarely occurs with therapeutic serum anticonvulsant levels. We report two patients with asterixis who were taking valproic acid and had serum levels within the therapeutic range. Neither patient had clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatotoxicity. Only one other patient has been reported with valproate-associated asterixis in the absence of toxic serum drug levels or hepatotoxicity. Asterixis seems to be due to a central effect of the drug unrelated to hepatotoxicity or sedation.
Fifty patients with fulminant hepatic failure from paracetamol overdose were reviewed retrospectively to determine whether there had been any avoidable delays in treatment with protective agents, or other preventable factors which could contribute to the high mortality. Only nine were admitted to the local hospital early enough (within 12 hours) to benefit from protective agents, and only three of these were treated. Treatment was delayed in two patients while the results of plasma paracetamol concentrations were awaited. Signs of grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy were never found until 72 hours after the overdose, and sudden deterioration in consciousness at an earlier stage was due either to the sedative effects of drugs or to hypoglycaemia, which in one patient went unrecognised for 24 hours. A rapid deterioration in prothrombin time, which became prolonged by at least 25 seconds at 48 hours, preceded the onset of grade 3 encephalopathy, and this is the time at which transfer should be arranged to avoid the danger of brain-stem coning. This occurred more rapidly in those transferred at a later stage of their illness.
The role of peripheral epinephrine in the influence of anxiety on pain was investigated by intravenously infusing epinephrine and placebo in three increasing doses. The effect of epinephrine was measured within subjects on several subjective and autonomic measures: subjective pain, skin conductance response, heart rate response due to electrical stimulation, threshold for heat pain and threshold for pressure pain. Heat pain threshold was measured both on normal skin and on skin sensitized with capsaicin, since there is evidence that effects of sympathetic stimulation are only to be found in damaged or sensitized skin. Epinephrine caused a slight increase in subjective pain due to electrical stimulation and a decrease in heat pain threshold, which was larger on capsaicin-treated than on normal skin. However, heart rate response due to electrical stimulation and pressure pain threshold were not significantly influenced, while skin conductance response was even inhibited by epinephrine. Attentional focus, which was manipulated within electrical stimulation, seemed to have a much stronger influence on pain responses than pharmacological manipulation, independent of epinephrine. It may be speculated that, although evidence was found for effects of epinephrine on pain, they may be overruled by effects of attention.
Increasing evidence supports a role for oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines, and apoptosis in the pathophysiology of focal ischemic stroke. Previous studies have found that the multi-action drug, carvedilol, is a mixed adrenergic antagonist, and that it behaves as an antioxidant and inhibits apoptosis. In the current study, the authors investigated whether carvedilol provides protection in focal cerebral ischemia and whether this protection is associated with reduced apoptosis and the downregulation of the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 1beta (IL-1beta). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by an intraluminal filament technique. Carvedilol (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) was injected daily subcutaneously 2 or 4 days before the induction of ischemia. Neurologic scores, infarct volumes, TUNEL staining, and mRNA levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were assessed at 24 hours reperfusion. The effect of carvedilol on microvascular cortical perfusion was studied with continuous laser-Doppler flowmetry. Twenty-four hours after MCAO, carvedilol at all three doses reduced infarct volumes by at least 40% and reduced neurologic deficits on average by 40% compared with vehicle-treated controls when given 2 or 4 days before the induction of ischemia. This protection was not mediated by changes in temperature or blood flow. Treatment with all three dose regimens resulted in fewer TUNEL positive cells compared with controls. At 24 hours reperfusion, carvedilol decreased TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression by 40% to 50% in the ipsilateral ischemic cortex compared with the contralateral controls. The results of the current study indicate that carvedilol is neuroprotective in focal cerebral ischemia and may protect the ischemic brain by inhibiting apoptosis and attenuating the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta.
Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent for life-threatening arrhythmias but has some noncardiac toxicity. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) induced by amiodarone during long-term therapy seems to be rare among adverse effects.
We report on two elderly cases that developed hyponatremia caused by SIADH occurring during the initial loading period of amiodarone therapy. Both cases improved within 3 weeks after reduction of the dose, although amiodarone was continued.
Amiodarone-induced SIADH may occur during the initial loading period, and it may be improved by reduction of the dose without discontinuation of the drug.
Antipsychotic medications differ in their sedative potential, which can affect cognitive performance. The primary objective of this double-blind study was to compare the effects of treatment initiation with risperidone and quetiapine on cognitive function in subjects with stable bipolar disorder.
Subjects had a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder in partial or full remission and a Young Mania Rating Scale score <or= 8 at screening. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences: risperidone-quetiapine or quetiapine-risperidone. Subjects in the risperidone-quetiapine sequence received 2 mg of risperidone with dinner and placebo with breakfast during period 1 and 100 mg of quetiapine with dinner and 100 mg with breakfast during period 2. Subjects in the quetiapine-risperidone sequence received the same treatments in reverse order. The 2 treatment periods were separated by a 6- to 14-day washout period. Cognitive function, including attention, working memory, declarative memory, processing speed, and executive functions, was measured before and after dosing. The Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue was also completed. The primary endpoint was a neurocognitive composite score (NCS). The study was conducted from November 2004 through August 2005.
Thirty subjects were randomly assigned; 28 took all doses of study medication and completed a baseline and at least 1 postbase-line assessment in each treatment. On the NCS, significantly better overall cognitive function was seen after risperidone than after quetiapine at each time point after dosing. Subjects performed significantly better after risperidone than after quetiapine (p < .05) on 9 of the 18 individual cognitive outcome measures and significantly better after quetiapine than after risperidone on 1 measure. Sleeping or the need for sleep during the test days was reported in significantly more patients after receiving quetiapine than risperidone.
The results indicate that initiation of quetiapine treatment was associated with more immediate adverse cognitive effects and increased somnolence than risperidone treatment.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00097032.
Many anesthetic agents are known to have cardiac effects. The effects of pentobarbital, thiopental and isoflurane on dogs with electrical remodeling are lacking.
We studied 12 dogs that underwent two anesthesias. First, anesthesia was induced (N=12) with intravenous thiopental (17 mg/kg) induction followed by isoflurane inhalation (1.5%-3% via endotracheal tube). For electrical remodeling, we created complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) and myocardial infarction (MI). In 6 of the 12 dogs we also infused nerve growth factor (NGF) to the right stellate ganglion. All dogs had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implanted. A second anesthesia was done 66 +/- 20 days later. In 8 of the 12 dogs (6 without NGF), pentobarbital was used as the only anesthetic. In the remaining 4 dogs (all with NGF), 3 received thiopental and 1 received isoflurane.
During the first anesthesia, none of 12 dogs had cardiac arrhythmia. During the second anesthesia, none of the 8 dogs that received pentobarbital developed ventricular fibrillation (VF). In contrast, all the dogs receiving either thiopental or isoflurane died of VF within 2 to 3 minutes. QT and P-P intervals before VF were 440 +/- 36 milliseconds and 298 +/- 28 milliseconds, longer and shorter (respectively) than those obtained the day prior to surgery (315 +/- 25 milliseconds, P < 0.001; 330 +/- 22 milliseconds, P < 0.01, respectively).
Thiopental and isoflurane are not arrhythmogenic in normal dogs and dogs with acute MI and CAVB, but are extremely proarrhythmic in dogs with chronic MI and CAVB. Consistent with the results of in vitro studies, pentobarbital did not induce ventricular arrhythmia in dogs with cardiac electrical remodeling.
The goal of this study was to investigate whether treatment with bezafibrate improves glucose tolerance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The study included 37 NIDDM patients with HbA1 concentrations greater than 8.5% and normal kidney and liver function who were being treated with diet alone or diet together with a sulfonylurea drug. One patient withdrew because of constipation. At randomization and after 3 mo of treatment, patients were given a standard mixed-test-meal tolerance test (MTT; 500 cal) after an overnight fast, and plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, metabolite, nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), and triglyceride concentrations were measured at 15- to 30-min intervals. Serum lipid, HbA1, and fructosamine concentrations were measured at monthly intervals. Glucose, NEFA, and triglyceride concentrations were significantly lower throughout the second MTT in bezafibrate patients (P less than 0.01-0.001) but not in the placebo group. Fasting serum insulin and C-peptide levels, but not postprandial concentrations, were reduced only in bezafibrate patients (P less than 0.05). After 3 mo, mean fasting serum triglyceride concentrations fell from 2.2 to 1.4 mM (P less than 0.001), total serum cholesterol concentrations from 6.3 to 5.5 mM (P less than 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations from 4.2 to 3.5 mM (P less than 0.001) in bezafibrate patients. There were no changes in serum lipid concentrations in the placebo group. Treatment of patients with moderately controlled NIDDM with bezafibrate improves glucose tolerance and the serum lipid profile. Bezafibrate treatment may be a useful adjunct to hypoglycemic therapy in patients with NIDDM.
The cystatin CRES (cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic; Cst8) is the defining member of a reproductive subgroup of family 2 cystatins of cysteine protease inhibitors and is present in the epididymis and spermatozoa, suggesting roles in sperm maturation and fertilization. To elucidate the role of CRES in reproduction, mice lacking the Cst8 gene were generated and their fertility examined. Although both male and female Cst8(-/-) mice generated offspring in vivo, spermatozoa from Cst8(-/-) mice exhibited a profound fertility defect in vitro. Compared to spermatozoa from Cst8(+/+) mice, spermatozoa from Cst8(-/-) mice were unable to undergo a progesterone-stimulated acrosome reaction and had decreased levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting a defect in the ability of Cst8(-/-) spermatozoa to capacitate. Incubation of Cst8(-/-) spermatozoa with dibutyryl cAMP and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine rescued the fertility defect, including the capacity for sperm protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Both untreated Cst8(+/+) and Cst8(-/-) spermatozoa, however, exhibited similar increased total levels of cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) activity throughout the capacitation time course compared to spermatozoa incubated under noncapacitating conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that mice lacking CRES may have altered local levels of cAMP/PKA activity, perhaps because of improper partitioning or tethering of these signaling molecules, or that the CRES defect does not directly involve cAMP/PKA but other signaling pathways that regulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation and capacitation.
Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency is a recessive autosomal neurodegenerative disorder resembling the Friedreich ataxia phenotype but is due to mutations in the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (TTPA) gene. In a recent article, we described a patient with ataxia carrying reduced serum vitamin E levels and showing CTA/CTG expansions of 320 triplet repeats in the SCA8 gene.
To perform a screening of the TTPA gene in the patient and to evaluate the effects of treatment with vitamin E on the patient's neurologic disturbances.
We performed a single-strand conformation polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5 exons of the TTPA gene in the patient's family members.
The results indicated the patient to be a compound heterozygote for 2 mutations (in exon 3), each transmitted by one of the 2 parents, yielding a nonfunctional protein.
We describe for the first time, to our knowledge, a mutated form of the TTPA gene in a patient also carrying an expansion in the SCA8 gene. The lack of improvement in the patient's symptoms on supplementation with alpha-tocopherol suggests that the SCA8 mutations may act in the neurodegeneration process, worsening the neurologic signs caused by the vitamin E deficit, and it could be speculated that the co-occurrence of mutant alleles for 2 distinct loci may influence the clinical course of the disease.
In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we studied 40 cigarette smokers to determine the effects of one week of transdermal clonidine hydrochloride (Catapres-TTS No. 2) treatment on the withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation. Subjects were instructed to maintain their usual cigarette intake during days 1 through 3 and cease smoking for days 4 through 6. All of the withdrawal symptoms measured (craving, irritability, anxiety, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and hunger) significantly increased during the three days of smoking cessation in the placebo group. There was a 4.3-fold increase in craving, a 3.8-fold increase in irritability, a 3.7-fold increase in anxiety, and a 3.3-fold increase in restlessness in the placebo group compared with the transdermal clonidine group during the three days of smoking cessation. Impairment of concentration and hunger were not significantly diminished by transdermal clonidine treatment during smoking cessation. In addition, a trend was present in the transdermal clonidine group to spontaneously decrease the number of cigarettes smoked per day during the smoking period. Side effects were generally mild. We conclude that transdermal clonidine treatment ameliorates some of the short-term withdrawal symptoms, especially craving, associated with smoking cessation.
