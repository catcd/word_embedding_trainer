Many malignant tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) express or over-express EGFR that have shown correlations with rapid growth, metastases, resistance to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and poor prognosis. Gefitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFRTK). Gefitinib specifically inhibited EGF-stimulated cell proliferation in vitro and it also exhibited a broad anti-tumor spectrum against NSCLC, prostate, colorectal, and ovarian cancers in vivo. Gefitinib showed dose-dependent and reversible reduction of c-fos mRNA level and decreased Ki67 significantly in tumors in vivo. In in vitro studies, gefitinib arrested the cell cycle at G1 phase by inducing intrinsic cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors and following inhibition of cdk2. Apoptosis was also seen in gefitinib-treated tumor cells and skin biopsy samples from clinical study. Gefitinib inhibited VEGF production in tumor cells through inhibition of EGFR signaling, leading to suppression of angiogenesis. In clinical studies, gefitinib demonstrated therapeutic benefit in patients who failed conventional chemotherapy. No correlation has been established between the anti-tumor activity of gefitinib and EGFR expression level, whilst sensitivity factors to gefitinib are yet to be elucidated. Identification of sensitivity factors will be a key for effective use of EGFRTK inhibitors including gefitinib for cancer treatment.
Resveratrol is indicated to be involved in neuroprotection and anti-inflammation in epileptic rats. The molecular mechanism is still not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of resveratrol in nuclear factor-kappa B associated inflammatory responses induced by status epilepticus. Our data showed that seizures activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), increased the activity of nuclear factor-kappa B and promoted the expressions of inflammatory molecules including inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-1β. Futhermore, resveratrol significantly inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and the production of proinflammatory molecules via mTOR pathway. Additionally, we also proved that the inhibition of mTOR signal by resveratrol was mostly attributed to AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation. Altogether, our results suggest that resveratrol suppresses inflammatory responses induced by seizures partially via AMPK/mTOR pathway.
In 1930, thousands of Americans were poisoned by an illicit extract of Jamaica ginger ("jake") used to circumvent the Prohibition laws. A neurotoxic organophosphate compound, triorthocresyl phosphate (TOCP), had been used as an adulterant. The earliest reports were of peripheral neuritis, but later it was evident that an upper motor neuron syndrome had supervened. This TOCP poisoning apparently involved various cell groups and tracts in the spinal cord; the lesions was not peripheral at all. We interviewed 11 survivors of the illness residing in eastern Tennessee. Four were carefully examined. The principal findings showed the spasticity and abnormal reflexes of an upper motor neuron syndrome. One patient had mild disease, despite typical findings, and had lived a normal life.
In 15 subjects 6 different parts of the body were treated with the potent topical corticosteroid (CS) amcinonide once a day for 21 days. The skin thickness of the treated areas was measured sonographically at intervals of 2 days. After completion of the CS application the regression of the CS-induced reduction in skin thickness was measured for a further 14 days. A clear thinning of the skin could be measured after only 4 days and continued up to the 21st day of treatment. This thinning regressed completely in all areas after 10-12 days. The thinning and regression curves were very similar for all body areas. Differences in intensity of thinning were evident. No tachyphylaxis was detected.
In recent years, considerable emphasis has been placed on identifying new cancer chemopreventive agents, which could be useful for the human population. Tephrosia purpurea has been shown to possess significant activity against hepatotoxicity, pharmacological and physiological disorders. Earlier we showed that Tephrosia purpurea inhibits benzoyl peroxide-mediated cutaneous oxidative stress and toxicity. In the present study, we therefore assessed the effect of Tephrosia purpurea on 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbal-13-acetate (TPA; a well-known phorbol ester) induced cutaneous oxidative stress and toxicity in murine skin. The pre-treatment of Swiss albino mice with Tephrosia purpurea prior to application of croton oil (phorbol ester) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cutaneous carcinogenesis. Skin tumor initiation was achieved by a single topical application of 7,12-dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (DMBA) (25 microg per animal per 0.2 ml acetone) to mice. Ten days later tumor promotion was started by twice weekly topical application of croton oil (0.5% per animal per 0.2 ml acetone, v /v). Topical application of Tephrosia purpurea 1 h prior to each application of croton oil (phorbol ester) resulted in a significant protection against cutaneous carcinogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. The animals pre-treated with Tephrosia purpurea showed a decrease in both tumor incidence and tumor yield as compared to the croton oil (phorbol ester)-treated control group. In addition, a significant reduction in TPA-mediated induction in cutaneous ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and [3H]thymidine incorporation was also observed in animals pre-treated with a topical application of Tephrosia purpurea. The effect of topical application of Tephrosia purpurea on TPA-mediated depletion in the level of enzymatic and non-enzymatic molecules in skin was also evaluated and it was observed that topical application of Tephrosia purpurea prior to TPA resulted in the significant recovery of TPA-mediated depletion in the level of these molecules, namely glutathione, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase and catalase. From these data we suggest that Tephrosia purpurea can abrogate the tumor-promoting effect of croton oil (phorbol ester) in murine skin.
Six calves were given the immunomodulator Baypamun and housed together with another six calves of which, three were experimentally infected with bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), whereas the remaining three served as untreated controls. The three experimentally infected calves as well as the three controls developed clinical signs of the typical acute form of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR). Of the calves treated with Baypamun, those that had only one injection of the immunomodulator, either at the start of the experiment (time 0) or 2 days later, underwent a much milder form of IBR and recovered in a shorter time than the experimentally infected calves or the controls. The calves that received four injections of the immunomodulator, i.e. at time 0 and subsequently for the next 3 days, remained healthy throughout the 30 days of observation. Moreover, the virus shedding by the Baypamun treated calves was significantly reduced. It was speculated that the use of an immunomodulator, eventually associated with a vaccination programme, would be a feasible approach to reduce significantly the onset of outbreaks of BHV-1, one of the main infectious agent initiating the respiratory disease in cattle.
We explored the activity of SIRT1 activators (SRT501 and SRT2183) alone and in combination with panobinostat in a panel of malignant lymphoid cell lines in terms of biological and gene expression responses. SRT501 and SRT2183 induced growth arrest and apoptosis, concomitant with deacetylation of STAT3 and NF-κB, and reduction of c-Myc protein levels. PCR arrays revealed that SRT2183 leads to increased mRNA levels of pro-apoptosis and DNA-damage-response genes, accompanied by accumulation of phospho-H2A.X levels. Next, ChIP assays revealed that SRT2183 reduces the DNA-binding activity of both NF-κB and STAT3 to the promoter of GADD45G, which is one of the most upregulated genes following SRT2183 treatment. Combination of SRT2183 with panobinostat enhanced the anti-growth and anti-survival effects mediated by either compound alone. Quantitative-PCR confirmed that the panobinostat in combination with SRT2183, SRT501 or resveratrol leads to greater upregulation of GADD45G than any of the single agents. Panobinostat plus SRT2183 in combination showed greater inhibition of c-Myc protein levels and phosphorylation of H2A.X, and increased acetylation of p53. Furthermore, EMSA revealed that NF-κB binds directly to the GADD45G promoter, while STAT3 binds indirectly in complexes with NF-κB. In addition, the binding of NF-κB/STAT3 complexes to the GADD45G promoter is inhibited following panobinostat, SRT501 or resveratrol treatment. Moreover, the combination of panobinostat with SRT2183, SRT501 or resveratrol induces a greater binding repression than either agent alone. These data suggest that STAT3 is a corepressor with NF-κB of the GADD45G gene and provides in vitro proof-of-concept for the combination of HDACi with SIRT1 activators as a potential new therapeutic strategy in lymphoid malignancies.
Acute oliguric renal failure due to acute interstitial nephritis developed in a patient after treatment with phenylbutazone. The histological, immuno-histological and serological features in this case are compatible with the involvement of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in the pathogenesis of this drug-induced interstitial nephritis. Other side effects of phenylbutazone on the kidney and the water and electrolyte metabolism are discussed.
To describe a case of pemoline-induced liver failure resulting in liver transplantation.
A 9-year-old white boy, diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and treated with pemoline, developed signs and symptoms of liver failure. Pemoline therapy was discontinued, but the patient's liver function continued to decline. Ultimately, a liver transplantation was required.
Pemoline, an agent used in ADHD treatment, has been associated with hepatotoxicity with the majority of cases occurring in pediatric patients. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of pemoline-induced liver failure resulting in liver transplantation. The mechanism of action remains unclear, with several hypotheses being postulated including hypersensitivity reactions, dose-related phenomena, and autoimmune-mediated reactions.
With increasing evidence linking pemoline to liver failure, this agent should not be considered first-line therapy for ADHD. Prior to initiating therapy, baseline liver function tests should be obtained and closely monitored, and parents and patients should be educated on the signs and symptoms of liver toxicity.
To investigate the association between insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene and the A/B polymorphism of the chymase (CMA) gene with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. The study subjects had been participants in along-term trial of therapy with an ACE inhibitor.
Follow-up data of 157 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were collected. DNA fragments of ACE gene and CMA gene were amplified by PCR and analysed by RFLP. LVDd, IVST and LVPWT were measured by Ultrasonic Cardiogram (UCG).
(1) When long-term treatment with Benazepril was carried out, the blood pressure was markedly decreased and the heart rate was maintained steadily. (2) Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy was improved. (3) The magnitudes of regression of LVM and LVMI during therapy were greater in the DD group than in the II and ID group. No significant differences of other indices were found in the different genotype groups of ACE. (4) No significant differences of all indices were found in the different genotype groups of CMA. (5) No interaction appeared between the genotypes of the ACE and the genotypes of the CMA.
Hypertensive patients with DD genotype were more likely to have regression of left ventricular hypertrophy when treated with ACE inhibitors than patients with other ACE genotypes. No evidence was found to support an association between CMA genotype and regression of LVH in those patients.
To describe a case of toxicity secondary to chronic ingestion of 6-12 times the recommended daily allowance of over-the-counter (OTC) chromium picolinate.
A 33-year-old white woman presented with weight loss, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, liver dysfunction (aminotransferase enzymes 15-20 times normal, total bilirubin 3 times normal), and renal failure (serum creatinine 5.3 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen 152 mg/dL). She had ingested chromium picolinate 1200-2400 microg/d for the previous 4-5 months to enhance weight loss. The patient had chromium plasma concentrations 2-3 times normal. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome were ruled out by clinical findings, peripheral blood smears, and a bone marrow biopsy. The patient was managed with supportive measures and received blood product transfusions and hemodialysis. Hemolysis stabilized and liver function improved over 6 days. Liver function returned to normal prior to discharge. Renal function began to return on day 12 and her serum creatinine on discharge was 1.3 mg/dL. One year later, all laboratory values were within normal limits.
Trivalent chromium is an essential trace element that is considered safe when ingested in normal quantities. Trivalent chromium compounds are used by patients to enhance weight loss, increase lean body mass, and/or improve glycemic control. Information regarding the toxicity of chromium picolinate is limited.
Chromium supplements may cause serious renal impairment when ingested in excess. Medication histories should include attention to the use of OTC nutritional supplements often regarded as harmless by the public and lay media.
To compare efficacy and toxicity of two schedules of intermediate-dose methotrexate (IDM) and cytarabine (Ara-C) in remission consolidation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
In 1986, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) began a randomized trial to test two schedules of consolidation chemotherapy in children with newly diagnosed B-precursor cell ALL. MTX and Ara-C were given as overlapping 24-hour infusions. The dose and sequence of MTX and Ara-C administration were based on a preclinical model that had demonstrated synergism between these two agents. Two hundred fifteen patients in complete remission were randomized to front-loading consolidation therapy in which six MTX/Ara-C infusions were administered at 3-week intervals from the 7th through the 19th week of therapy. Two hundred thirteen patients in complete remission were randomized to receive standard consolidation therapy in which the six MTX/Ara-C infusions were given every 12 weeks from the 7th through the 67th week of therapy.
Both regimens produced similar rates of adverse side effects, except for a higher incidence of CNS toxicity in individuals randomized to the front-loading arm (32 of 215 v 12 of 213 patients, P = .002). Leukoencephalopathy occurred in three patients on the front-loading regimen and was permanent in one. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the probability of continuing in complete remission for 5 years was 79% (SE = 5%) and 85% (SE = 5%) for good-risk patients, and 66% (SE = 6%) and 61% (SE = 7%) for poor-risk patients randomized to front-loading and standard regimens, respectively.
Although differences in complete remission durations were not statistically significant by log-rank analysis (P = .62 for good-risk patients, .89 for poor-risk patients, and .99 overall), the results are comparable to those in previous studies using more toxic agents as components of remission consolidation therapy.
Bromocriptine was given in a controlled trial to 86 parkinsonian patients. Eight of 30 previously untreated patients with early and mild disease showed sustained benefit for two years and did not develop "on-off" effects or dyskinesias. Only two of 23 patients unable to tolerate or failing to respond to levodopa benefited from bromocriptine. Thirty-three patients with residual disabilities despite maximum tolerated doses of levodopa were also given bromocriptine: although benefit accrued, treatment was abandoned because of unacceptable side effects, and there was no improvement in the 11 with severe "on-off" disabilities. Although it was found that benefit from 70 mg daily of bromocriptine was comparable to that from 750 mg of levodopa with carbidopa, bromocriptine seems to offer no advantage to the majority of patients who have received or are receiving levodopa and/or carbidopa.
To determine whether non-invasive measurement of brain electrical activity can predict ischemic brain damage, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory- (SEP) and auditory- (AEP) evoked potentials before, during, and after trimethaphan-induced profound arterial hypotension in dogs. The authors set out to compare the change in electrical activity with the degree of brain damage, as determined by microscopic examination. Dogs were anesthetized with halothane (1.4 vol % inspired), maintained horizontal (head at the level of the heart), and ventilated mechanically (FIO2 0.50); deviations from normal acid-base status were corrected. Twenty animals received a 1.5-mg/kg intravenous bolus of trimethaphan. Three animals were resistant to the drug. The remaining animals had profound hypotension [mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) at some steady level between 12 and 25 mmHg] for 1 h. Eight of these animals died during or soon after the hypotensive period as a consequence of cardiac arrest (three), intestinal bleeding (three) or unknown causes (two). In all survivors, EEG intensity and the amplitude of the SEP decreased during hypotension; both variables recovered with restoration of MABP. All nine animals surviving hypotension had no apparent neurologic or behavioral deficit nor any histologic evidence of ischemic brain cell injury. We were thus unable to find a MABP threshold for brain with minimal brain injury. Our findings suggest, under the conditions of our experiments, a great margin of tolerance for profound hypotension by the brain in this species. Other organ systems--the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and liver--proved to be more susceptible to ischemic damage. Eight of the nine surviving animals had elevations in serum alanine transaminase (SGPT), aspartate transaminase (SGOT), and alkaline phosphatase. Animals with the greatest increases in these enzymes showed centrilobular hepatocyte degeneration.
Chelation of excessive neuronal zinc ameliorates zinc neurotoxicity and reduces subsequent neuronal injury. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of this neuroprotective effect, we used a focused cDNA array of stress-response genes with zinc chelation (calcium EDTA) in our rat model of fluid percussion brain injury at 2 h, 24 h, and 7 days after injury. In parallel experiments, we compared neuronal cell death in TUNEL-stained brain sections in traumatized rats with and without calcium EDTA treatment. Zinc chelation induced the expression of several neuroprotective genes; neuroprotective gene expression correlated with substantially decreased numbers of TUNEL-positive cells.
The examine the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (ApoE-/- mice) fed a "Western-style diet" and the effect of simvastatin intervention.
Male ApoE-/- mice (n=36) were fed a "Western-style diet" from the age of 8 weeks. After 16 weeks, they were randomly given either simvastatin (25 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹) or normal saline (control group) by gavage for 8, 16, or 24 weeks. The left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and diameter of the myocardial cells were determined with Hematoxylin-Eosin stain, and the level of fibrosis of the myocardial matrix was assessed with Masson stain. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), Cathepsin S (Cat S), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in the myocardium of ApoE-/- mice.
ApoE-/- mice fed a "Western-style diet" showed an significant age-dependent increase in total cholesterol (TC), LV wall thickness, myocardial cell diameter and LV collagen content (P<0.05). The simvastatin treatment group showed significantly reduced LV wall thickness, myocardial cell diameters and LV collagen content at 40 weeks when compared with the control group (P<0.05). Furthermore, treatment with simvastatin also significantly inhibited the mRNA and protein expressions of MMP-9 and Cat S as well as increased the mRNA and protein expressions of PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma at 32 and 40 weeks compared with the control group (P<0.05).
ApoE-/- mice fed a "Western-style diet" had cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, which worsened with age. Simvastatin treatment inhibits the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and this effect may be mediated through increased levels of PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma and reduced levels of TC, MMP-9, and Cat S.
We investigated whether benidipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB), can normalize cardiac expression profiles of the endothelin (ET)-1 system in insulin-resistant diabetes. Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of human Type 2 diabetes, were treated for 12 wk with vehicle or benidipine (3 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). OLETF rats exhibited a significant increase in ET-1 in plasma and left ventricular (LV) tissues compared with nondiabetic controls. Expression of prepro-ET-1, ET-converting enzyme, and ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in LV tissues was also significantly higher in OLETF rats. The two MAPKs, JNK and p38MAPK, both of which are activated by ET-1, were more abundantly expressed in OLETF rat LV tissues. All these alterations were reversed to nondiabetic levels when OLETF rats were treated with the subdepressor dose of benidipine. Furthermore, benidipine therapy resulted in hindering cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac perivascular fibrosis in OLETF rats. The beneficial actions of benidipine at the subdepressor dose on cardiac remodeling in insulin-resistant diabetes may involve normalization of the upregulated ET-1 system.
Lower molecular weight polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), components of flame retardants, are found in the environment and in human and animal tissues. Toxicity studies were conducted in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice by administering a flame retardant containing these lower molecular weight PBDEs (BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, and BDE153) by oral gavage 5 days/week for 13 weeks at doses of 0.01, 5, 50, 100 or 500mg/kg/day. Liver was the primary target organ in rats and mice. Treatment-related increases in liver weights, liver cytochrome P450 (1A1, 1A2, 2B) and UDPGT (rats only) levels, and liver lesions were seen in both rats and mice. Hepatocyte hypertrophy and vacuolization increased in incidence and severity with treatment, and occurred at levels of 50mg/kg and above in rats, and at 100mg/kg and above in mice. Liver Cyp 1A1, 1A2, and 2B levels were increased at exposure levels of 50mg/kg and above in rats and mice. In addition, treatment-related thyroid lesions occurred particularly in rats. The most sensitive parameter for PBDE toxicity was the increase in liver weights which occurred at 5mg/kg above in rats and 50mg/kg and above in mice. These results suggest that liver may be a target organ for carcinogenesis processes after long-term administration of PBDEs. A chronic PBDE study is currently being conducted by the National Toxicology Program.
Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an autosomal dominant vascular disease. The clinical manifestations are epistaxis, mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations. There are two predominant types of HHT caused by mutations in Endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) (ACVRL1) genes, HHT1 and HHT2, respectively. No cure for HHT has been found and there is a current need to find new effective drug treatments for the disease. Some patients show severe epistaxis which interferes with their quality of life. We report preliminary results obtained with Raloxifene to treat epistaxis in postmenopausal HHT women diagnosed with osteoporosis. We tried to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of raloxifene. ENG and ACVRL1 genes code for proteins involved in the transforming growth factor beta pathway and it is widely accepted that haploinsufficiency is the origin for the pathogenicity of HHT. Therefore, identification of drugs able to increase the expression of those genes is essential to propose new therapies for HHT. In vitro results show that raloxifene increases the protein and mRNA expression of ENG and ALK1 in cultured endothelial cells. Raloxifene also stimulates the promoter activity of these genes, suggesting a transcriptional regulation of ENG and ALK1. Furthermore, Raloxifene improved endothelial cell functions like tubulogenesis and migration in agreement with the reported functional roles of Endoglin and ALK1. Our pilot study provides a further hint that oral administration of raloxifene may be beneficial for epistaxis treatment in HHT menopausal women. The molecular mechanisms of raloxifene involve counteracting the haploinsufficiency of ENG and ALK1.
This subanalysis of the phase 3 VISTA trial aimed to assess the frequency, characteristics and reversibility of, and prognostic factors for, bortezomib-associated peripheral neuropathy (PN) in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma ineligible for high-dose therapy who received bortezomib plus melphalan-prednisone.
Patients received nine 6-wk cycles of VMP (bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2), days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, 32, cycles 1-4, and days 1, 8, 22, 29, cycles 5-9; melphalan 9 mg/m(2), days 1-4, cycles 1-9; and prednisone 60 mg/m(2), days 1-4, cycles 1-9).
Overall, 47% of patients receiving VMP developed PN, including 19% grade 2 and 13% grade ≥ 3 (<1% grade 4). The PN incidence was dose-related and reached a plateau at a cumulative bortezomib dose of approximately 45 mg/m(2). Median time to PN onset was 2.3 months. Bortezomib-associated PN was reversible; 79% of events improved by at least one NCI CTCAE grade within a median of 1.9 months and 60% completely resolved within a median of 5.7 months, with reversibility similar in responding and non-responding patients. By multivariate analysis, baseline neuropathy was the only consistent risk factor for any PN [hazard ratio (HR) 1.785, P=0.0065], grade ≥ 2 PN (HR 2.205, P=0.0032), and grade ≥ 3 PN (HR 2.438, P=0.023); age, pre-existing diabetes, International Staging System stage, obesity, and creatinine clearance did not affect the overall rate of PN.
Rates of bortezomib-induced PN in the frontline setting were similar to those in relapsed patients and resolved in most cases.
The Authors report a case of incessant torsade de pointes, associated with QT prolongation, due to the proarrhythmic effect of quinidine, which was successfully treated with i.v. verapamil. The arrhythmia occurred after oral administration of quinidine polygalacturonate (550 mg + 275 mg + 275 mg over a 4-hour period) for the conversion of atrial fibrillation in a 41-year-old woman with mild mitral stenosis and regurgitation. Verapamil was administered as an i.v. bolus (5 mg at a rate of 1 mg/min) and with in four minutes the arrhythmia disappeared. The electrophysiological mechanisms of torsade de pointes and the potential role of Ca+(+)-channel-blocking agents in its treatment are briefly discussed.
We have analyzed the effect of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB, Kanechlor-400) on 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) induced lung tumor. Male A/J mice (6 weeks old) were used for the experiment. A total of 2.5 mg/kg PCB was administered intraperitoneally (PCB group), a total of 0.38 mmol/kg 1-NP was administered intraperitoneally for 17 times (1-NP group), PCB was administered followed by i.p. injection of 1-NP (PCB + 1-NP group), and only vehicle was administered (control group). The lung lesions induced were examined 18 weeks after the final treatment with 1-NP or vehicle. In control group, no neoplastic lesion in the lung was induced. In PCB group, only one lesion with adenoma was induced. In 1-NP group, various kinds of lung neoplastic lesions including hyperplasia, adenoma and adenocarcinoma were induced. In PCB + 1-NP group, both the number and size of tumors induced were significantly more than those in 1-NP group. In addition, the number of adenocarcinoma formed was more in PCB + 1-NP group than in 1-NP group. Each lesion was microdissected to collect and analyze DNA of the targeted tissue. K-ras gene mutation was detected in part of adenoma lesions and all the carcinoma lesions. The mutation was found in either 1-NP or PCB + 1-NP group, but not in control and PCB group. The pattern of K-ras mutation was CAA to CGA in codon 61 or GGT to GAT in codon 12. There was no difference in the pattern of K-ras mutation despite of the pretreatment with PCB. Although the present data are from small sample size, it was suggested that PCB may promote (but not initiate) 1-NP induced lung tumorigenesis, and may not induce K-ras mutation directly in the experimental system.
Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Despite intensive clinical investigation and many novel therapeutic approaches, average survival for the patients with malignant gliomas is only about 1 year. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has shown potent and cancer-selective killing activity and drawn considerable attention as a promising therapy for cancers, but concerns over delivery and toxicity have limited progress. We have developed a secretable trimeric TRAIL (stTRAIL) and here evaluated the therapeutic potential of this stTRAIL-based gene therapy in brain tumors. An adenovirus (Ad-stTRAIL) delivering stTRAIL was injected into intra-cranial human glioma tumors established in nude mice and tumor growth monitored using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ad-stTRAIL gene therapy showed potent tumor suppressor activity with no toxic side effects at therapeutically effective doses. When compared with 1, 3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), a conventional therapy for malignant gliomas, Ad-stTRAIL suppressed tumor growth more potently. The combination of Ad-stTRAIL and BCNU significantly increased survival compared to the control mice or mice receiving Ad-stTRAIL alone. Our data indicate that Ad-stTRAIL, either alone or combined with BCNU, has promise as a novel therapy for malignant gliomas.
Oxidative stress, which is defined as the over-production of free radicals, can dramatically alter neuronal function and has been linked to status epilepticus (SE). The pathological process and underlying mechanisms involved in the oxidative stress during SE are still not fully clear. In the current study, SE was induced in rats by lithium-pilocarpine administration. Our data show that hippocampal neuron death occurs at 6h and is sustained for 7 days after SE. The production of nitric oxide (NO) started to increase at 30 min and was evident at 6h and 7 days after SE, which coincided with increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) after SE, whereas, activated caspase-3 prominently appeared at 7 days after SE. Further, FK506, an immunosuppressant, partially rescued the neuron death and attenuated the expression of NO, nNOS, iNOS, MDA and activated caspase-3. Taken together, our study indicates that oxidative stress mediated hippocampal neuron death occurs prior to caspase-3 activation and that FK506 plays an important role in protecting hippocampal neurons during status epilepticus.
The aim of the study was to compare hypotensive reaction after treatment with enalapril and enalapril with isosorbide mononitrate in patients with mild and moderate hypertension. Investigations were carried out in 49 patients. In every patient at baseline and after 3 hours from oral administration of enalapril or enalapril and isosorbide mononitrate plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity, plasma aldosterone concentration and blood pressure were estimated. All measurements were repeated after 7 days of treatment. Adding a nitric oxide donor--isosorbide mononitrate--to enalapril does not enhance decrease in blood pressure nor influence plasma renin activity, plasma ACE activity nor plasma aldosterone concentration in patients with mild and moderate hypertension.
EPO-018B, a synthetic peptide-based erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA), is coupled to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and designed to specifically bind and activate the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor to result in production of red blood cells. This study was designed to evaluate the potential subchronic toxicity of EPO-018B for Cynomolgus monkeys and Sprague-Dawley rats both at 0, 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg every week for 5 weeks, followed by 6-week recovery for rats and 12-week recovery for monkeys. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for rats and monkeys were both considered to be at least 0.5 mg/kg/day, the minimum toxic dose to be 5.0 mg/kg/day and the severe toxic dose to be more than 50.0 mg/kg/day. The toxicological effects included the exaggerated pharmacology and secondary sequelae that resulted from an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment to healthy animals. Most treatment induced effects were reversible or showed ongoing recovery upon discontinuation of treatment. The anticipated patient population for EPO-018B treatment is targeted to be the anemia patients caused by chronic renal failure or chemotherapy against to cancer and is expected to have an ideal clinical application prospect.
A polysaccharide fraction (SFPSA) was obtained from the rhizomes of Stachys floridana Schuttl. ex Benth. by hot water extraction and sequential purification of anion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography. SFPSA was found to be an acidic polysaccharide fraction with an average molecular weight of 168kDa and composed of rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose and arabinose in a molar percentage of 7.75:1.65:14.92:1.87:33.17:40.64, respectively. SFPSA could inhibit the proliferation and growth of human colon cancer HT-29 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner within 48h, induce the apoptosis and increase the accumulation in G₂/M phase of HT-29 cells. Furthermore, it was found that SFPSA could decrease Bcl-2 mRNA level, and increase the mRNA expressions of Bax and p53 and the activity of caspase-3. These results indicated that SFPSA might induce apoptosis of HT-29 cells through regulation of apoptosis-associated gene expressions such as Bcl-2, Bax and p53 and the activation of caspase-3.
Side-effects of longterm therapy on the coagulation system become manifest either as hemorrhages or as an increased risk of thromboembolism. The most frequent drug-induced coagulation defect is thrombopathia. The most important drug-induced plasmatic coagulation disorders are caused by anti-coagulants and therefore predictable. In patients exposed to hemorrhage risk, non-steroidal antiphlogistics are not contraindicated since they entail inhibition of platelet aggregation and prolonged hemorrhage time. High doses of penicillin G and the semisynthetic penicillins can lead to hemorrhage in patients with renal insufficiency. Corticosteroids and contraceptives however tend to induce hypercoagulability.
