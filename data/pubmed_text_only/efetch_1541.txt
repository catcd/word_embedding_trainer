Nonionic low-osmolar contrast agents are considered safe for intravenous or intra-arterial administration and are used widely in the general population, as well as in patients on hemodialysis therapy. There are data limited to case reports for contrast-induced hearing loss; however, the ototoxicity induced by contrast agents in patients with chronic kidney disease has never been described. We report a case of permanent sensorineural deafness after abdominal aortic angiography with iopamidol in a woman with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis therapy and review the literature relating to contrast use with the development of hearing impairment.
Bortezomib (VELCADE), formerly known as PS-341, is a novel dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor with in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity. Bortezomib has been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. In this report, we examined the sensitivity of cell lines derived from Ewing's sarcoma-family of tumors (ESFT) to Bortezomib. Five ESFT-derived cell lines, TC-71, TC-32, SK-N-MC, A4573 and GRIMES, were highly sensitive to Bortezomib (IC(50) = 20 to 50 nM), and underwent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following drug treatment. Bortezomib-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase 3, cleavage of PARP and induction of p27 and p21 expression. Moreover, Bortezomib exhibited synergistic activity against the TC-71 and TC-32 cell lines when combined with TRAIL. Our results suggest that Bortezomib might be a useful agent for treatment of ESFT, when used alone or in combination with TRAIL.
We report the cases of two patients fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, who developed a marked depressive symptomatology in the first period of a treatment with clozapine, and were treated successfully with serotonergic drugs (paroxetine, clomipramine). The AA. discuss the possible neurochemical determinants and implications of these clinical observations.
Low level, antenatal exposure to dioxins is associated with low birth weight, which in turn is associated with long-term sequelae. We exposed the human extravillous cytotrophoblast (EVT) lines HTR-8/SV40 and TCL1 to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and assessed cell growth, invasion, and differentiation. TCDD had no effect on cell proliferation, invasion, or tube formation in Matrigel. The EVT-derived cells expressed a functional aryl hydrocarbon receptor protein; however, TCDD exposure did not alter expression levels of proteins involved in EVT differentiation in early pregnancy, including hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1A), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Integrin A1, A6, and AVB3. These results suggest that the reduction in fetal weight induced by dioxin is not the result of vascular remodeling via EVT dysfunction.
There is great evidence in recent years that oxygen free radicals play an important role in the pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study was performed to assess the changes in red blood cells thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) levels, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities in patients with autism (n = 27) compared to age- and sex-matched normal controls (n = 26). In the autistic group, increased TBARS levels (p < 0.001) and XO (p < 0.001) and SOD (p < 0.001) activity, decreased CAT (p < 0.001) activity and unchanged ADA activity were detected. It is proposed that antioxidant status may be changed in autism and this new situation may induce lipid peroxidation. These findings indicated a possible role of increased oxidative stress and altered enzymatic antioxidants, both of which may be relevant to the pathophysiology of autism.
A 70-year-old woman with angina pectoris developed a migrainous headache 3 days after starting oral propranolol. She had not complained of headaches since her second and third decade when she had suffered occasional attacks of migraine. It is likely that propranolol was the cause of her headache, since it recurred when she was rechallenged with the drug.
The authors investigated whether computerized parameters quantifying ventricular repolarization delay, heterogeneity, and instability characterize individuals who developed drug-induced Torsades de Pointes. Assessing an individual's propensity to Torsades de Pointes when exposed to a QT-prolonging drug is challenging because baseline QT prolongation has limited predictive value. Five-minute digital 12-lead electrocardiograms were acquired at baseline and after a sotalol challenge in 16 patients who had a history of Torsades de Pointes in the context of a QT-prolonging drug and 17 patients who did not have such history. Computerized measurements of QTc, T peak to T end intervals (TpTe), TpTe/QTc, and QT variability were implemented, and novel quantifiers of ventricular repolarization heterogeneity from the early (ERD) and late (LRD) part of the T wave were investigated. Compared with electrocardiograms of patients without a history of Torsades de Pointes, the baseline electrocardiograms of patients with a history of Torsades de Pointes had a longer QTc and an increased repolarization heterogeneity of the early part of the T wave (ERD30%: 44 +/- 13 vs 35 +/- 8 ms, P = .02). On sotalol, the electrocardiograms from individuals with Torsades de Pointes revealed a delay of the terminal part of the T wave that was not present in patients without Torsades de Pointes (TpTe: 27 +/- 40 vs -2 +/- 21 ms, P = .02; LRD70%: 20 +/- 29 vs 2 +/- 4 ms, P = .04). Results suggest that the electrocardiogram abnormalities characterizing patients with a history of Torsades de Pointes are (1) an increased repolarization heterogeneity at baseline and (2) a sotalol-induced prolongation of the terminal part of the T wave.
Apoptosis is an important physiological process. Normally, a healthy cell maintains a delicate balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, allowing it to live and proliferate. It is thus not surprising that disturbance of this delicate balance may result in disease. It is a well known fact that apoptosis also contributes to several acquired forms of hearing impairment. Noise-induced hearing loss is the result of prolonged exposure to excessive noise, triggering apoptosis in terminally differentiated sensory hair cells. Moreover, hearing loss caused by the use of therapeutic drugs such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and cisplatin potentially may result in the activation of apoptosis in sensory hair cells leading to hearing loss due to the "ototoxicity" of the drugs. Finally, apoptosis is a key contributor to the development of presbycusis, age-related hearing loss. Recently, several mutations in apoptosis genes were identified as the cause of monogenic hearing impairment. These genes are TJP2, DFNA5 and MSRB3. This implies that apoptosis not only contributes to the pathology of acquired forms of hearing impairment, but also to genetic hearing impairment as well. We believe that these genes constitute a new functional class within the hearing loss field. Here, the contribution of apoptosis in the pathology of both acquired and genetic hearing impairment is reviewed.
Pyrethroids are known to be neurotoxic. However, their toxic effects including that of allethrin on the male reproductive tract are not elucidated. Adult male rats were treated orally with 25, 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg body weight allethrin every day for 60 days. Lipid peroxidation was increased (p < 0.001) in the caput, cauda, and testes. Nitric oxide production was increased (p < 0.001) in the caput, but unaltered in the cauda and testes. The activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase were decreased in the caput and cauda where as a decrease was observed in the testis obtained from allethrin treated rats. In the epididymides and testes, damage to tubular architecture, congestion, degeneration of epithelial cell lining, intestinal edema, and presence of dead or degenerating spermatids were observed in a dose dependent manner. The expression profile of genes involved in spermatogenesis (Tgf-beta1), sperm maturation (Spag11e), and sperm function (Defb22) were reduced (p < 0.001) in allethrin rats. The expression of p53 gene was decreased and increased phosphorylation of MAPK (p42/p44) expression was observed the male reproductive tract tissues of allethrin treated rats. Although earlier studies have reported the effects of allethrin inhalation because of the use of mosquito coils and vaporizers, our results for the first time prove that oral exposure to allethrin could affect fertility and may contribute to deregulation of cell cycle in the male reproductive tract.
To determine whether patients with an uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) and an isolate resistant to trimethoprim had worse clinical outcomes following empirical treatment with trimethoprim 200 mg twice daily for 3 days than did those with a susceptible isolate.
This was a prospective cohort study of clinical outcome. We enrolled 497 women (>or=18-70 years) presenting to general practitioner surgeries in Norwich and Gloucester with at least two symptoms of acute (<7 days) uncomplicated UTI. Significant bacteriuria was defined as >or=10(4) cfu/mL from a mid-stream urine (MSU).
Of enrolled patients 75% (334/448) had significant bacteriuria, and trimethoprim resistance was present in 13.9% (44/317) of isolates. Patients with resistant isolates had a longer median time to symptom resolution (7 versus 4 days, P=0.0002), greater reconsultation to the practice (39% versus 6% in first week, P<0.0001), more subsequent antibiotics (36% versus 4% in first week, P<0.0001) and higher rates of significant bacteriuria at 1 month (42% versus 20% with susceptible isolate, P=0.04). Half of patients reconsulting in the first week had a resistant organism.
Patients with uncomplicated UTI caused by trimethoprim-resistant organisms had significantly worse clinical outcomes than those with trimethoprim-susceptible organisms. Nevertheless, trimethoprim resistance was rarer than predicted from routine laboratory submissions and we calculate that 23 women require microbiological investigation to prevent one reconsultation arising from resistance-based treatment failure. We therefore suggest empirical antibiotic treatment in acute, uncomplicated UTIs. If patients reconsult in the first week, we suggest a change of antibiotic treatment with urine culture and susceptibility testing then done. More generally, laboratory resources should concentrate on resistance surveillance to inform empirical antibiotic choice.
Fifty-day-old unilaterally nephrectomized and 1% saline-drinking Sprague-Dawley CD male rats were divided into three comparable groups on the basis of blood pressure, body weight, and fluid intake. The control group received vehicle only, the second group received 19-nor-progesterone [19-nor-pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (19-Nor-Prog)] in a dose of 250 micrograms/24 h, and the third group received aldosterone-acetate (Aldo-Ac) in a dose of 125 micrograms/24 h, by means of Alzet osmotic minipumps implanted sc for 21 days. Both the 19-Nor-Prog- and the Aldo-Ac-treated rats became hypertensive to a similar degree in the course of the study. Rats given Aldo-Ac also developed polydipsia, decreased body weight, cardionephromegaly, and hypokalemia. The 19-Nor-Prog-treated rats showed no significant changes in heart and kidney weights. The hypertensinogenicity of 19-Nor-Prog is unrelated to significant changes in heart and kidney weight, as is the case with potent mineralocorticoids.
Nine depressed patients were treated with alaproclate, a selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor, for 3 weeks in a dose of 400 mg daily. The pupillary responses to tyramine, phenylephrine, and pilocarpine eye drops were measured on consecutive days before, after 1 week and after 3 weeks of treatment. The tyramine-induced mydriasis was unaffected by alaproclate, suggesting that it does not significantly inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline. The pilocarpine-induced miosis and the phenylephrine-induced mydriasis were both enhanced after 1 week but not after 3 weeks of treatment. This suggests that alaproclate acutely increases the responsiveness of postsynaptic muscarinic and alpha 1 adrenoceptors.
To investigate the potential role of drug therapy in preventing or exacerbating seizure-related brain injury in the prepubescent brain, we administered kainic acid to rats at postnatal day 35. Therapy with daily phenobarbital was started directly before or 1 day after kainic acid was administered, and was continued through postnatal day 153. Rats receiving phenobarbital had therapeutic concentrations during most of the 24-hour dosing period, but also experienced supratherapeutic peak concentrations. The animals were subsequently tested using the water maze (a measure of visuospatial memory), open field (a measure of activity level), and handling tests (a measure of emotionality). The frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures was monitored during and after phenobarbital therapy. Kainic acid resulted in status epilepticus on postnatal day 35 in all the rats that received it but those receiving phenobarbital first manifested a shorter and less severe status epilepticus as compared to the rats given kainic acid alone. Rats starting phenobarbital immediately before kainic acid was administered did not differ from control rats on behavioral testing and had no subsequent spontaneous recurrent seizures and no histological lesions. Rats receiving kainic acid alone performed significantly poorer than did control rats in the water maze, were more aggressive, had histological lesions, and manifested spontaneous recurrent seizures. As compared to the group treated only with kainic acid, rats receiving kainic acid followed by phenobarbital at postnatal days 36 to 153 manifested similar aggressiveness and histological lesions, similar frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures after phenobarbital taper, and even greater disturbances in memory, learning, and activity level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The possibility that intranasally administered phenylephrine might cause systemic vasoconstriction and an important increase in blood pressure if administered to susceptible individuals in higher doses was investigated in two groups potentially at high risk: 12 patients with chronic nasal congestion whose blood pressure was normal and 14 patients with hypertension receiving the beta-blocker metoprolol. On two separate days increasing doses (0.5 to 4 mg) of phenylephrine or a placebo of identical appearance were instilled into the nostrils at hourly intervals. The blood pressure and the heart rate were recorded every 10 minutes. The total amount of phenylephrine administered (7.5 to 15 mg) was 4 to 30 times the manufacturer's recommended dose. No significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate occurred in either group after the instillation of phenylephrine.
Between May 1980 and April 1981 four patients were referred to one hospital with syncope or recurrent ventricular fibrillation while taking antiarrhythmic or phenothiazine drugs. In all the patients ventricular tachyarrhythmias with the characteristics of torsades de pointes were documented in association with prolonged QT intervals. With removal of the offending agent (in all the patients) supplemented by temporary overdrive pacing (in two patients) the tachyarrhythmias subsided. This study suggests that drug-induced torsades de pointes is an important clinical entity that occurs more frequently than has been suspected.
Muscle symptoms in patients who are treated with statins and have normal creatine kinase levels are not well understood.
To report biopsy-confirmed myopathy and normal creatine kinase levels associated with statin use.
Case reports from preliminary analysis of an ongoing clinical trial.
Clinical research center in a community hospital.
Four patients with muscle symptoms that developed during statin therapy and reversed during placebo use.
1) Patients' ability to identify blinded statin therapy and 2) standard measures of functional capacity and muscle strength.
All four patients repeatedly distinguished blinded statin therapy from placebo. Strength testing confirmed weakness during statin therapy that reversed during placebo use. Muscle biopsies showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, including abnormally increased lipid stores, fibers that did not stain for cytochrome oxidase activity, and ragged red fibers. These findings reversed in the three patients who had repeated biopsy when they were not receiving statins. Creatine kinase levels were normal in all four patients despite the presence of significant myopathy.
Some patients who develop muscle symptoms while receiving statin therapy have demonstrable weakness and histopathologic findings of myopathy despite normal serum creatine kinase levels.
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in childhood. Empiric antibiotic therapy is guided by the clinical presentation, the patient's ability to take oral agents and the local resistance pattern of Escherichia coli (E. coli), the most common pathogen. Most children (with both upper and lower UTI) can safely be treated with oral antibiotics. We recommend pivmecillinam or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid as first-line empiric therapy for upper UTI. Amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are no longer first-line oral agents due to increasing E. coli resistance to both drugs. For lower UTI nitrofurantoin is an excellent first choice. In Norway, lack of paediatric antibiotic syrups is a great challenge and we recommend that such formulations are introduced to the Norwegian market.
Local anesthetics are the most commonly used drugs in dentistry. The number of adverse reactions reported, particularly toxic reactions, are extraordinarily negligible. This article reports a case of lidocaine toxicity with its typical manifestation in a 37-yr-old healthy male. The toxic reaction followed transoral/transpharyngeal topical spraying of lidocaine preoperatively during preparation for general anesthesia. A review of dosages of the most commonly used local anesthetic drugs in dentistry and the management of a toxic reaction is presented. Clinicians need to be in a position to recognize and successfully manage this potential adverse reaction.
To study the comparative efficacy of the quinine and artesunate in complicated malaria in children.
All cases admitted to the Pediatrics ward of our hospital with clinical features of complicated malaria (WHO criteria) having asexual forms of P. falciparum in the peripheral smear, were included in the study. Relevant investigations were carried out for confirmation of diagnosis and to assess the prognosis. The patients were sub-grouped into 6 categories as per clinical presentations and each subgroup received alternatively either quinine or artesunate by systematic random sample method. Every odd number received quinine (Group-1) and every even number received artesunate (Group-2). 40 cases in each group were considered for the study and the data obtained were compiled and analyzed by suitable statistical tests.
80 children with complicated malaria enrolled in the present study, of which 48 were boys and 32 were girls. The mean age was 7.93+3.56 years. The most common presentations were fever, splenomegaly and altered sensorium. The CRT, FCT and PCT were significantly less in the artesunate group (50.4 +/- 31.49 hrs; 43.55 +/- 20.12 hrs, and 41.67 +/- 16.78 hrs respectively) as compared to the quinine group (70.15 +/- 17.56 hrs, 62.23 +/- 16.99 hrs, and 52.24 +/- 12.69 hrs respectively) ( p<0.05) No side effects were observed in the artesunate treated group.
Artesunate is a much better drug than quinine in complicated malaria in terms of rapid coma resolution, fever clearance, parasite clearance and better tolerability.
Since Oct. 1981 a new systemic antifungal drug Ketoconazole is available in the Federal Republic of Germany that has proven effective even in severe cases with fungal infections. This case-study will call attention on a rare but important side effect, namely Ketoconazole induced hepatitis. As an acute icteric viral hepatitis, type Non-A-Non-B-hepatitis possibly misdiagnosed only a carefully compiled history of the recent intake of drugs points at the real cause of hepatitis. In our case-report we observed a considerable increase in serum enzymes, especially GOT, GPT and GLDH after a drug-challenge with two tablets. We recommend so-called liver functions tests 2 to 3 weeks after beginning of therapy and further-on in monthly intervals. Histologically at that time toxic hydropic changes of the liver cells and a mesenchymal reaction with portal and intralobular mainly eosinophilic infiltration could be established. The serum enzymes came to normal only after 12 weeks.
Bumetanide, a new diuretic exerting its major effect on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, was evaluated in 20 patients with congestive heart failure. Dosage ranged from 1 mg to 3 mg daily depending on the patient's condition. The results after 3 and 8 days' treatment showed that bumetanide caused a significant diuresis, an increased excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride, and a comparable fall in the serum levels of these electrolytes. Changes in electrolyte levels were directly related to the dose of the drug. The resultant hypochloraemia was accompanied by a slight metabolic alkalosis. A comparative crossover study between placebo, bumetanide and frusemide using equipotent doses was performed in 10 patients. Both drugs had a similar effect upon water excretion and the serum and urinary electrolytes.
It is conceivable that toxic metals contribute to obesity by influencing various aspects of metabolism, such as by substituting for essential micronutrients and vital metals, or by inducing oxidative stress. Deficiency of the essential metal zinc decreases adiposity in humans and rodent models, whereas deficiencies of chromium, copper, iron, and magnesium increases adiposity. This study utilized the NHANES 99-02 data to explore the association between waist circumference and body mass index with the body burdens of selected toxic metals (barium, cadmium, cobalt, cesium, molybdenum, lead, antimony, thallium, and tungsten). Some of the associations were significant direct relationships (barium and thallium), and some of the associations were significant inverse relationships (cadmium, cobalt, cesium, and lead). Molybdenum, antimony, and tungsten had mostly insignificant associations with waist circumference and body mass index. This is novel result for most of the toxic metals studied, and a surprising result for lead because high stored lead levels have been shown to correlate with higher rates of diabetes, and obesity may be a key risk factor for developing diabetes. These associations suggest the possibility that environmental exposure to metals may contribute to variations in human weight gain/loss. Future research, such as prospective studies rather than the cross-sectional studies presented here, is warranted to confirm these findings.
CD147, also named extracelluar matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), is a member of the immunoglobulin family and a glycoprotein enriched on the surface of tumor cells, which promotes invasion, metastasis, growth and survival of malignant cells, and is known to confer resistance to some chemotherapeutic drugs. To determine the possible role of CD147 in the invasive properties of laryngeal carcinoma, we used an RNA interference approach to silence CD147 expression in the Hep2 cell line at high levels of CD147 expression. Our results showed that CD147 expression was significantly impeded at both mRNA and protein levels, which resulted in a decrease of the Hep2 invasion activity in vitro and tumorigenicity in nude mice. The suppression of CD147 expression also sensitized cells to cisplatin. Our current results indicated that CD147 was a laryngeal carcinoma-related gene and CD147 might be a potential target for therapeutic anti-cancer drugs.
To investigate the effect of pretreatment with a low dose of rocuronium on the occurrence of etomidate-induced myoclonus.
Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study.
Medical center in South Korea.
110 ASA physical status I, II, and III patients scheduled for elective cardiac or pulmonary surgery with general anesthesia.
All patients were randomized to pretreatment with a low dose of rocuronium (0.06 mg/kg; Group R) or placebo (saline; Group S), followed three minutes later by etomidate (0.3 mg/kg).
Patients were monitored for myoclonic movements and pain on a scale of 0-3. Bispectral index (BIS) and electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded continuously throughout the procedure.
Frequency of myoclonus was significantly lower in Group R (25%) than in Group S (63%). In the latter group, there was no difference in the frequency of male (59%) and female (68%) patients experiencing myoclonus. In Group S, EMG activity and BIS were significantly increased in patients who experienced severe myoclonus, and BIS was well correlated with EMG activity.
Pretreatment with a small dose of rocuronium before induction of anesthesia with etomidate significantly reduced the frequency of myoclonus.
The use of intravenous melphalan at higher doses is limited by severe myelosuppression. It was postulated that GM-CSF would permit the use of higher dose melphalan with only moderate myelosuppression easily manageable in an outpatient setting. Therefore, a phase I study of intravenous melphalan utilizing GM-CSF (recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) support was initiated. Intravenous melphalan at doses of 15-45 mg/m2 was administered every 28 days. GM-CSF was utilized at doses of 10-20 micrograms/kg/day subcutaneously Days 2-21 on a 28-day cycle. Twenty-five patients received 53 courses of therapy. The dose-limiting toxicities were severe or life-threatening granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Utilizing 20 micrograms/kg/day GM-CSF, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of melphalan is 30 mg/m2 and, with 10 mg/kg/day GM-CSF, the maximum tolerated melphalan dose is only 20 mg/m2. One patient with ovarian cancer achieved a partial response. Because the reported MTD of intravenous melphalan without GM-CSF is 30 mg/m2, GM-CSF has not allowed sufficient escalation of the intravenous melphalan dose for routine outpatient use.
We describe a patient with a longstanding paraplegia who developed spinal myoclonus on 3 different occasions spanning one year, once after an enhanced CT scan and twice after excretory urographies, one of which was also followed by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. To our knowledge only one case of spinal myoclonus secondary to the administration of intravenous contrast material in a patient with a spinal arteriovenous malformation has yet been reported. Taken together, the findings in these cases suggest that spinal myoclonus following intravenous iodine administration is indicative of an underlying spinal cord lesion.
