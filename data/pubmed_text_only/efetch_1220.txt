Previous investigations have shown that the combination of the conventional chemotherapeutic agent lomustine (CCNU) and the nitroimidazole radiation sensitizer misonidazole can lead to an improved therapeutic result. To study whether altered CCNU metabolism plays a role in this chemopotentiation, mice were treated with known modifiers of hepatic microsomal enzymes prior to CCNU exposure, and tumor response and systemic toxicity were assessed. KHT sarcoma-bearing C3H/HeJ mice were pretreated with either (a) five daily doses of phenobarbital (80 mg/kg) to induce the microsomal enzymes and then CCNU 48 hours later or (b) a 50-mg/kg dose of the microsomal enzyme inhibitor SKF 525A 1 hour before CCNU. Tumor response and normal tissue toxicity following treatment were measured using a regrowth delay and 30-day lethality assay, respectively. Phenobarbital pretreatment reduced both the antitumor efficacy and toxicity of CCNU (factor of approximately 0.8), while SKF 525A increased the effect of CCNU in both cases (factor of approximately 1.6). Thus, unlike pretreatments with the sensitizer misonidazole, pretreatments with phenobarbital or SKF 525A did not result in a therapeutic advantage for CCNU.
Cardiac troponin I is a useful biomarker of myocardial injury, but its use in mice and application to early drug discovery are not well described. The authors investigated the relationship between cTnI concentration in serum and histologic lesions in heart tissue from mice treated with isoproterenol (ISO). Cardiac TnI concentrations in serum increased in a dose-dependant manner and remained increased twenty-four to forty-eight hours after a single administration of isoproterenol. Increased cTnI concentration was of greater magnitude and longer duration than increased fatty acid binding protein 3 concentration, aspartate aminotransferase activity, and creatine kinase activity in serum. Isoproterenol-induced increases in cTnI concentrations were both greater and more sustained in BALB/c than in CD1 mice and correlated with incidence and severity of lesions observed in heart sections from both strains. In drug development studies in BALB/c mice with novel kinase inhibitors, cTnI concentration was a reliable stand-alone biomarker of cardiac injury and was used in combination with measurements of in vivo target inhibition to demonstrate an off-target contribution to cardiotoxicity. Additional attributes, including low cost and rapid turnaround time, made cTnI concentration in serum invaluable for detecting cardiotoxicity, exploring structure-activity relationships, and prioritizing development of compounds with improved safety profiles early in drug discovery.
Marked interpatient variability exists in blood pressure response to beta-blocker monotherapy. We tested the hypothesis that 2 common polymorphisms in the gene for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor are associated with antihypertensive response to metoprolol in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.
Forty hypertensive men and women aged 35 to 65 years were studied. Baseline studies included 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Patients took 50 mg metoprolol twice daily with weekly titration to response or 200 mg twice daily. After a minimum of 4 weeks at stable dose, treatment phase 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was repeated. The codon 49 and 389 genotypes for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor were determined by polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multilinear regression was performed to determine the impact of genotype and other variables on blood pressure response to metoprolol.
Patients homozygous for Arg at codon 389 had a nearly 3-fold greater reduction in daytime diastolic blood pressure (-13.3% +/- 8.4% versus -4.5% +/- 8.2%, P =.0018) compared with those who carried the variant allele. The haplotype pair (diplotype) for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor was also a significant predictor of response, with patients having the Ser49Arg389/Ser49Arg389 diplotype demonstrating a decline in blood pressure of 14.7 mm Hg versus 0.5 mm Hg in patients with the Gly49Arg389/Ser49Gly389 diplotype. In multiregression analysis, baseline daytime diastolic blood pressure, codon 389 genotype, and codon 49 genotype were significant predictors of blood pressure after treatment.
Our data suggest that beta(1)-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms are important determinants of antihypertensive response to metoprolol. In the future, codon 49 and 389 genotypes or beta(1)-adrenergic receptor haplotypes might be used to predict the diastolic blood pressure response to metoprolol in patients with hypertension.
The authors report the case of a man with a laryngeal neoplasm treated by chemotherapy including 5 FU who presented a severe cardiogenic shock responding to medical therapy with a favourable outcome. This classical clinical presentation is commented by the authors. Based on the electrocardiogram, the echocardiography and a review of literature, they favour as first underlying hypothesis the secondary metabolic pathway linked to ribonucleic acid (RNA), rather than a possible coronary spasm.
Cocaine use, frequently associated with other substance abuse, is becoming more common in the pregnant patient. These patients are more likely to experience peripartum complications. A case of hypertension and pulmonary oedema in such a patient, possibly triggered by ketamine, is reported. A tumultuous course in the intensive care unit was resolved when the patient's hypertension and sympathetic reactivity were successfully treated with barbiturates. A number of factors supported a diagnosis of barbiturate withdrawal in this patient, its onset also was related temporally to ketamine administration. Hypertension should be considered a sign of acute barbiturate withdrawal. If a history of cocaine use, particularly crack cocaine, is elicited, one should suspect multiple substance abuse and be especially cautious when administering ketamine.
We report a 75-year-old female gastric cancer patient with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy, which was successfully treated by the H2-blocker, lafutidine. From December 2007, she underwent second-line chemotherapy using paclitaxel (80 mg/m/2 day 1, 7, 14/28 days) for peritoneal dissemination which had been refractory to first-line chemotherapy using S-1 (80 mg/m / 2, day 1-28/42 days). After 2 courses, CT showed a complete response (CR) of the peritoneal dissemination. However, at the same time peripheral neuropathy appeared, which was aggravated to grade 3 at the 6th course. Beginning with the 7th course, we administered lafutidine (10 mg/day) for peripheral neuropathy, which recovered to grade 1 after 14 days of lafutidine administration. Lafutidine was administered until July 2008, when peripheral neuropathy kept grade 1 without lafutidine. After 9 courses, paclitaxel therapy failed because of general fatigue.
A 38 year-old man with ulcerative colitis recently treated with balsalazide was admitted with chest pain. Investigations demonstrated myocardial necrosis, ECG changes, echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities but normal epicardial coronary arteries and no LV scar on cardiac MRI. Myocarditis was diagnosed and balsalazide therapy was withdrawn, resulting in a full recovery and resolution of abnormalities.
To describe a profound cardiac dysfunction and a status epilepticus after a massive bupropion overdose.
A 35-year-old man was admitted in coma following the deliberate ingestion of 12 g of bupropion. The course was marked by the rapid onset of severe and prolonged status epilepticus and cardiogenic shock. Plasma bupropion level determined four hours after the estimated time of ingestion was 1.4 mg/L. All clinical features resolved completely in response to symptomatic treatment.
Several cases of bupropion overdose, with sinus tachycardia and seizures rapidly corrected by symptomatic treatment, have been reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this case of overdose with bupropion alone, at very high doses, is the first to describe clinical features comprising severe and prolonged status epilepticus and direct cardiotoxicity with the development of cardiogenic shock documented by echocardiogram.
To compare the pharmacokinetic properties of valproate modified-release (MR) granules with those of two existing valproate sustained-release (SR) formulations to confirm their bioequivalence.
Two randomized, open-label, two-period crossover studies under fasting conditions, and one open-label, randomized, single-dose, three-period crossover study under fasting and nonfasting conditions. Each study had a 7-day washout interval between periods.
Three hospitals in France.
Healthy male Caucasian volunteers aged 18-35 years (27 subjects in study 1, 24 in study 2, and 24 in study 3).
In studies 1 and 2, during two 15-day periods, subjects received either valproate MR granules or an existing valproate SR formulation. In study 3, subjects received only valproate MR granules 500 mg, once with water after a 10-hour fast, once with yogurt after a 10-hour fast, and once 30 minutes after a high-fat morning meal.
Blood samples were collected, and pharmacokinetic parameters of valproic acid were determined for single-dose (studies 1-3) and repeated-dose (studies 1 and 2) administration. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for area under the concentration-time curve and maximum concentration (C max ) were in the acceptance limits for bioequivalence (i.e., 90% CI 0.80-1.25) after single and repeated doses of valproate MR granules administered once/day or twice/day. Although time to C max was slightly decreased with valproate MR granules, this difference did not induce a significant difference in terms of C max . Valproate MR granule formulation was bioequivalent with existing SR formulations. High-fat breakfast or yogurt did not modify either the bioavailability or pharmacokinetic profile of valproate MR granules. This formulation was well tolerated. The adverse event profile did not differ among the various regimens.
Valproate MR granules, administered once/day or twice/day, may be an attractive alternative to existing SR formulations for patients who have difficulties with swallowing tablets or who favor granules over tablets.
Urethane-induced lung tumors and their genetic changes were investigated in transgenic (Tg) mice carrying a human prototype c-Ha-ras gene (rasH2 mice). Male and female rasH2 mice and non-transgenic (non-Tg) littermates were injected intraperitoneally with 1000 mg/kg of urethane once or three times at 2-day intervals. Hyperplasias and adenomas of the lung were observed in all animals of each group from week 10, and carcinomas were observed in male and female rasH2 mice of the triple injection group from week 10 and female non-Tg mice of the single injection group at 15/20 weeks. The multiplicities of lung proliferative lesions including hyperplasias, adenomas and carcinomas, in treated rasH2 mice were significantly higher than those in treated non-Tg mice. CAG to CTG transversions were observed in the c-Ha-ras gene in these lung proliferative lesions of rasH2 mice of the single injection group at high incidence (male: 58.3%, female: 62.5%), but no mutations of the mouse c-Ki-ras gene were evident in either rasH2 or non-Tg mice. In the triple injection group, transgene mutations were detected at a relatively low incidence, and mouse c-Ki-ras gene mutations(CAA to CGA) were observed in both rasH2 and non-Tg mice. These results suggest that the variation of the lesions induced by different doses of urethane was not the cause of the variation of the mutation spectrum and mutations of both transgene and mouse c-K-ras gene are not principal genetic events in urethane-induced lung proliferative lesions in rasH2 mice.
Two men (66 and 73 Years) with a cardiovascular history were hospitalized for rapid onset encephalopathy associated with myoclonia and an extrapyramidal syndrome. On the basis of the French Pharmacovigilance system, this symptomatology has been attributed to the coadministration of a proton pump inhibitor, lansoprazole (15mg/day) with levodopa. Lansoprazole withdrawal led to a normalisation of the situation.
Complete carcinogens must possess both initiating and promoting properties. Most N-nitroso compounds are mutagens and are considered to be initiators, but some are not mutagenic and yet are complete carcinogens. To investigate the two activities, brief treatments of male F344 rats with each of three mutagens, nitrosodimethylurea, nitrosodiethylurea and nitrosobis-(2-oxopropyl)-amine, were followed by chronic treatment (40 weeks) with one of four non-mutagens, nitrosomethyl-3-carboxypropylamine, nitrosodiethanolamine, nitrosomethyl-2-hydroxypropylamine or phenobarbital, the last being a well-known promotor of liver tumors in rats. Each treatment group consisted of 18 animals and there were control groups of 15 animals without initiation and 15 animals without promotion. All surviving rats were sacrificed at week 78. There were almost no tumors in untreated controls or in groups treated with the promotors, other than bladder tumors in one group. Certain tumors were numerous in the initiated groups, but there were only a few instances of increased incidences after treatment with the promotors. The action of the initiators appeared to be the dominant factor and there was scant indication in this experiment of the induction of tumors by the promotors of promotion of initiated cells in most organs (e.g. the liver). This indicates that it is unlikely that non-genotoxic carcinogens induce tumors by promotion of already-initiated cells, but that some other mechanism prevails.
There is growing interest in using cannabinoid type 2 (CB(2)) receptor agonists for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In this report, we describe the pharmacological characteristics of MDA7 (1-[(3-benzyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-6-yl)carbonyl]piperidine), a novel CB(2) receptor agonist.
We characterized the pharmacological profile of MDA7 by using radioligand-binding assays and in vitro functional assays at human cannabinoid type 1 (CB(1)) and CB(2) receptors. In vitro functional assays were performed at rat CB(1) and CB(2) receptors. The effects of MDA7 in reversing neuropathic pain were assessed in spinal nerve ligation and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy models in rats.
MDA7 exhibited selectivity and agonist affinity at human and rat CB(2) receptors. MDA7 treatment attenuated tactile allodynia produced by spinal nerve ligation or by paclitaxel in a dose-related manner. These effects were selectively antagonized by a CB(2) receptor antagonist but not by CB(1) or opioid receptor antagonists. MDA7 did not affect rat locomotor activity.
MDA7, a novel selective CB(2) agonist, was effective in suppressing neuropathic nociception in two rat models without affecting locomotor behaviour. These results confirm the potential for CB(2) agonists in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
The purpose of this study was to examine how pain to punctate mechanical stimuli varies with position within the zone of secondary hyperalgesia. Secondary hyperalgesia was produced by an intradermal injection of capsaicin (50 microg) into the volar forearm of human volunteers (n=9). Before and at 20, 60 and 100 min after the capsaicin injection, a computer-controlled electromechanical stimulator was used to deliver controlled-force stimuli to the skin via a 12-mm wide, 100-microm thick blade probe. Three forces (16, 32 and 64 g; 1 s) were each applied in a random order to 10 sites spaced in 1-cm increments along a line starting 1 cm from the injection site and ending near the wrist. At 40 and 80 min after capsaicin injection the 'zone of hyperalgesia' was determined with use of a hand-held 20-g von Frey probe. Whereas, before capsaicin, the blade probe produced little or no pain, after capsaicin the 32-g and 64-g stimuli evoked pain consistently within but not outside the border of secondary hyperalgesia determined with the von Frey probe. Within the zone of hyperalgesia the average pain ratings to the 64-g stimulus decreased exponentially with distance from the injection site. Surprisingly, the space constant for this exponential decay was large (about 18 cm), and thus the decrease in pain ratings from the center to the edge of the secondary zone was small (37%). However, pain ratings dropped precipitously just outside the zone of secondary hyperalgesia. This finding unlikely reflects a ceiling effect because pain ratings within the zone of secondary hyperalgesia increased linearly with force. The relatively uniform pain ratings to the blade stimuli within the zone of secondary hyperalgesia and the sharp border that delimits the zone of hyperalgesia indicate that this sensory disturbance approaches being an 'all-or-nothing' phenomenon. Thus, a two-state model for central plasticity is needed to explain secondary hyperalgesia.
We describe a mutation in the FGFR2 gene in affected members of a large family with inherited autosomal dominant craniosynostosis. The mutation is a G1044A transition at codon 344 of exon B of the gene and results in abnormal splicing of the FGFR2 transcript. The phenotypic effect of the mutation varies greatly. It ranges from minor anomalies such as slight hypertelorism and maxillary hypoplasia to severe manifestations such as brachycephaly and dolichocephaly. The severe cases required surgery because of increased intracranial pressure. The patients cannot be assigned clinically to one of the known craniosynostotic syndromes with mutations in FGFR2, e.g., Crouzon, Pfeiffer, or Jackson-Weiss. This study demonstrates that FGFR2 mutations can result in a spectrum of craniofacial abnormalities even within one family. The known eponymic syndromes of Crouzon, Pfeiffer, or Jackson-Weiss only describe phenotypic extremes of this spectrum. Therefore, the clinical classification should be abandoned and replaced by a molecular one such as "FGFR-associated craniosynostosis syndromes."
Although the overall incidence of infective endocarditis in the paediatric population is considered to be low, over the last 20 years a rising trend in infective endocarditis has been observed among children. This could be due to several reasons including the availability of improved diagnostic techniques, use of continuous central venous catheters and cardiac implants increasing the risk of infection, and the survival of a greater number of infants with congenital heart disease as a result of improved medical management. The predominant causative organisms of paediatric endocarditis include staphylococci and streptococci. There is increased concern surrounding the emergence of endocarditis in children caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and drug resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The treatment approach to paediatric endocarditis is similar to that for adult patients with endocarditis because of similarities in disease pathogenesis and aetiology. The therapeutic goal is to achieve sterilisation of the cardiac vegetations. The choice of antibacterial is dependent upon the susceptibility profile of the causative organism. Vancomycin or gentamicin is recommended for enterococcal endocarditis, according to guidelines from the American Heart Association. For staphylococcal endocarditis in patients with no prosthetic valve, oxacillin or nafcillin with or without gentamicin is the treatment of choice. In the case of endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin is commonly used in patients with no prosthetic valve and a combination of vancomycin, gentamicin and rifampicin (rifampin) for patients with prosthetic material. Cefazolin or ceftriaxone is the treatment of choice for penicillin allergic paediatric patients with endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci. While there have been no major changes in endocarditis therapy for the last decade, the current focus is on the recognition of multiple-drug resistant pathogens and the use of newer agents such as quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of resistant bacterial endocarditis. Prophylactic antibacterial therapy is recommended for procedures thought to be associated with the occurrence of bacteraemia involving organisms commonly associated with endocarditis. These include dental extractions and oral, respiratory tract, genitourinary, gastrointestinal or oesophageal procedures. Prophylactic antibacterials recommended by the American Heart Association during genitourinary and gastrointestinal surgical procedures in high risk patients include ampicillin + gentamicin or vancomycin + gentamicin in high risk patients with penicillin allergy. Ampicillin has been recommended for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in children undergoing oral, respiratory tract or oesophageal procedures. In the case of penicillin allergy in these patients, cephalosporins, clindamycin, azithromycin or clarithromycin have been recommended. The general consensus is that antibacterial prophylaxis during dental procedure is unnecessary, and in fact propagates bacterial resistance.
Renal biopsy specimens from two patients with gold nephropathy showed two distinctly different types of alterations. The first demonstrated lesions suggestive of immunologic injury primarily to the glomerulus and identical with membranous glomerulonephritis. The second had no evidence of immunologic injury, but contained extensive vacuolar degeneration of proximal tubular epithelial cells. Ultrastructurally, the vacuoles contained lipid materials and occupied the basal portion of the cells. Other tubular cells contained numerous "gold-containing" cytosegresomes. In this second specimen, it appeared that the filtered gold had a direct toxic effect on the tubular epithelium and perhaps also on the glomerular capillary wall. These findings suggest that gold nephropathy may indeed be a spectrum of a combination of both direct toxic and immunologic injury to glomeruli and tubules.
In a double-blind cross-over study, the arterial changes produced by hydrochlorothiazide were compared with those observed after the calcium antagonist felodipine in 16 patients with mild to moderate systemic hypertension. Diameter changes at the site of the common carotid and brachial arteries were investigated using pulsed Doppler velocimetry, and pulse-wave velocities of the aortic, brachial and femorotibial areas were measured using standard noninvasive techniques. Whereas hydrochlorothiazide and felodipine similarly decreased blood pressure, hydrochlorothiazide did not change pulse-wave velocity, and the diameters of the brachial and common carotid arteries. Felodipine significantly decreased pulse-wave velocity, and increased brachial arterial diameter and compliance, with no change in carotid arterial diameter. Evidence was found that although felodipine had specific effects on the arterial system of hypertensive subjects, hydrochlorothiazide did not produce any sizable arterial change. These differential effects may influence specifically the heart afterload, with important consequences for diuretics that are known to cause minimal changes in cardiac structure and function.
Diabetic nephropathy is a common cause for end-stage renal disease. Present study investigated the beneficial role of arjunolic acid (AA) against streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic nephropathy in rats. Diabetic renal injury was associated with increased kidney weight to body weight ratio, glomerular area and volume, blood glucose (hyperglycemia), urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. This nephro pathophysiology increased the productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), enhanced lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation and decreased intracellular antioxidant defense in the kidney tissue. In addition, hyperglycemia activates polyol pathway by increasing aldose reductase (AR) with a concomitant reduction in Na+-K+-ATPase activity. Investigating the oxidative stress responsive signaling cascades, we found the activation of PKCdelta, PKCvarepsilon, MAPKs and NF-kappaB (p65) in the renal tissue of the diabetic animals. Furthermore, hyperglycemia disturbed the equilibrium between the pro and anti-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family of proteins as well as reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, elevated the concentration of cytosolic cytochrome C and caspase-3 activity. Treatment of AA effectively ameliorated diabetic renal dysfunctions by reducing oxidative as well as nitrosative stress and deactivating the polyol pathways. Histological studies also support the experimental findings. Results suggest that AA might act as a beneficial agent against the renal dysfunctions developed in STZ-induced diabetes.
The effects of a single dose of either nifedipine 20 mg (n = 10) or captopril 50 mg (n = 10) were compared in 20 patients with symptomatic, chronic severe aortic regurgitation using angiography and micromanometer left ventricular pressure measurements. At 90 minutes, mean arterial pressure was reduced comparably after both drugs (86 +/- 15 to 76 +/- 18 mm Hg for nifedipine vs 95 +/- 19 to 77 +/- 18 mm Hg for captopril, p = NS between groups by analysis of variance), as was wedge pressure (11 +/- 5 to 9 +/- 4 mm Hg vs 13 +/- 9 to 9 +/- 5 mm Hg for captopril). Systemic vascular resistance was reduced more (p = 0.01) after nifedipine than after captopril (1,549 +/- 468 to 1,067 +/- 291 dynes s cm-5 vs 1,632 +/- 559 to 1,436 +/- 392 dynes s cm-5). Heart rate declined after captopril (84 +/- 14/min to 75 +/- 15/min, p = 0.002) but not after nifedipine (78 +/- 13 min to 80 +/- 14 min). Forward stroke volume increased after nifedipine (58 +/- 14 to 70 +/- 16 ml, p < 0.001) but not after captopril (58 +/- 17 to 59 +/- 16 ml). Thus, cardiac output increased after nifedipine (4.4 +/- 0.9 to 5.5 +/- 1.2 liters/min, p < 0.001) but decreased after captopril (4.8 +/- 1.2 to 4.3 +/- 1.0, p = 0.004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Twelve-hour overnight pneumocardiograms were assessed for sleep architecture and sleep efficiency in two groups of healthy term newborn infants: a group exposed prenatally to cocaine alone or in combination with other drugs and a non-exposed group. Sleep was differentiated from wakefulness by an increase in heart rate, an increase in or variation in the duration and amplitude of the respiration and increased artifacts on the heart rate channel. Quiet and active sleep were determined by the regularity or irregularity of heart rate and respiration. In a sub-set of infants, the number of arousals during active sleep was calculated. Overall significance was confirmed by ANOVA followed by paired comparisons using the Student's-test. When compared to non-exposed infants within the first week of life, infants exposed prenatally to cocaine alone or in combination with other drugs demonstrated more wakefulness and less sleep (P < 0.05), more frequent arousals during active sleep (P < 0.01), and the tendency of a higher proportion of active sleep compared to quiet sleep. These findings may have implications to both behavioral and respiratory control findings associated with prenatal cocaine exposure.
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-(ALK-) positive large B-cell lymphoma (ALK+ LBCL) is a rare, aggressive tumor characterized by an immunoblastic or plasmablastic morphologic appearance, expression of ALK, CD138, CD45, EMA, and often IgA by immunohistochemistry, and characteristic chromosomal translocations or rearrangements involving the ALK locus. The morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap of this tumor with other hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies may result in misdiagnosis. The tumor has been identified in both pediatric and adult populations and demonstrates a male predominance. Presentation is most often nodal, particularly cervical. No association with immunocompromise or geographic location has been recognized. The most common gene rearrangement is between clathrin and ALK (t(2;17)(p23;q23)), resulting in the CLTC-ALK chimeric protein, although other fusions have been described. Response to conventional chemotherapy is poor. The recent introduction of the small molecule ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, may provide a potential new therapeutic option for patients with this disease.
Ruthenium (Ru) derivatives have less toxicity and higher water-solubility than cisplatin, giving them great potential as antitumor metallodrugs. In this study, zebrafish were employed as a whole-organism model to screen new Ru compounds for anti-cell proliferation activity. After soaking fish embryos in cisplatin and five Ru derivatives, [Ru(terpy)(bpy)Cl]Cl, [Ru(terpy)(dppz)OH(2)](ClO(4))(2), [Ru(terpy)(tMen)OH(2)](ClO(4))(2), [Ru(terpy)(Me(4)Phen)OH(2)](ClO(4))(2), and Ru(bpy)(2)Cl(2), only cisplatin and [Ru(terpy)(bpy)Cl]Cl-treated embryos displayed obvious phenotypic effects, such as fin-reduction. After further modification of [Ru(terpy)(bpy)Cl]Cl's main structure and the synthesis of two structurally related compounds, [Ru(terpy)(dcbpyH(2))Cl]Cl and [Ru(terpy)(dmbpy)Cl]Cl, only [Ru(terpy)(dmbpy)Cl]Cl exhibited fin-reduction phenotypes. TUNEL assays combined with immunostaining techniques revealed that treatment with cisplatin, [Ru(terpy)(bpy)Cl]Cl, and [Ru(terpy)(dmbpy)Cl]Cl led proliferating fin mesenchymal cells to undergo apoptosis and consequently caused fin-reduction phenotypes. Furthermore, [Ru(terpy)(bpy)Cl]Cl was able to activate the P53-dependent and independent pathways, and induced human hepatoma cells to undergo apoptosis. In summary, it was concluded that the zebrafish model was effective for the screening of phenotype-based antiproliferation metallodrugs.
Osthole is an agent isolated from Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson and Angelica pubescens and has been used to treat several diseases, including metabolic syndromes. To investigate the hypoglycemic effects of osthole in diabetic db/db mice and the underlying mechanisms of these effects by in vitro assay, diabetic db/db mice and cell experiments were utilized to understand its possible effects. Osthole significantly activated both PPARalpha and PPARgamma in a dose-dependent manner based on the results of the transition transfection assay. The activation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma by osthole also resulted in an increase in the expression of PPAR target genes such as PPAR itself, adipose fatty acid-binding protein 2, acyl-CoA synthetases, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A. In vitro results suggested that osthole might be a dual PPARalpha/gamma activator, but its chemical structure differed from that of the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs. In addition, osthole markedly activated the AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream acetyl CoA carboxylase molecules by increasing their phosphorylation levels. Finally, obese diabetic db/db mice were treated with osthole by different administered routes, and osthole was found to markedly reduce blood glucose level. Interestingly, osthole did not reduce the blood insulin or lipid levels, two phenomena that did occur in animals treated with insulin sensitizers like PPAR agonists. These results suggest that osthole can alleviate hyperglycemia and could be potentially developed into a novel drug for treatment of diabetes mellitus.
The urokinase system is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer cells and is expressed at low levels in normal cells. To develop a platform for intracellular and targeted delivery of therapeutics in ovarian cancer, we conjugated urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) antibodies to liposomal nanobins. The arsenic trioxide-loaded nanobins had favorable physicochemical properties and the ability to bind specifically to uPA. Confocal microscopy showed that the uPA-targeted nanobins were internalized by ovarian cancer cells, whereas both inductively coupled plasma optical mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses confirmed more than four-fold higher uptake of targeted nanobins when compared with untargeted nanobins. In a coculture assay, the targeted nanobins showed efficient uptake in ovarian cancer cells but not in the normal primary omental mesothelial cells. Moreover, this uptake could be blocked by either downregulating uPA receptor expression in the ovarian cancer cells using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) or by competition with free uPA or uPA antibody. In proof-of-concept experiments, mice bearing orthotopic ovarian tumors showed a greater reduction in tumor burden when treated with targeted nanobins than with untargeted nanobins (47% vs. 27%; P < 0.001). The targeted nanobins more effectively inhibited tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo compared with untargeted nanobins, inducing caspase-mediated apoptosis and impairing stem cell marker, aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A1 (ALDH1A1), expression. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of tumors and organs corroborated these results, showing preferential localization of the targeted nanobins to the tumor. These findings suggest that uPA-targeted nanobins capable of specifically and efficiently delivering payloads to cancer cells could serve as the foundation for a new targeted cancer therapy using protease receptors.
Fluorometric measurements of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) are generally used to screen lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) using dried blood spots (DBSs). However, in DBS, it is difficult to measure lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity due to the influence of other lipases in whole blood. Recently, Hamilton used a fluorometric enzyme assay with 4-MU derivatives to measure the LAL activity in DBS. This method requires mercury chloride as stopping reagent, and the fluorescence intensity of 4-MU was measured at an acidic pH. We report a revised method to measure the LAL activity without using toxic mercury chloride and to measure the fluorescence intensity of 4-MU at a basic pH. For this measurement, we established a more practical method that does not require mercury chloride. The LAL activity in DBS was measured in 51 normal controls, seven obligate carriers and seven patients with CESD. The average LAL activities ± SD in the DBS from the normal, obligate carriers and CESD patients were 0.68 ± 0.2 (range: 0.3-1.08), 0.21 ± 0.1 (range: 0.11-0.41) and 0.02 ± 0.02 (range: 0-0.06) nmol/punch/h, respectively. There was a significant difference between the normal and the CESD. Our method does not require toxic mercury chloride and is an appropriate revised enzyme assay using DBS for screening patients with CESD.
Gliomas are the most common and devastating tumors of the central nervous system. Several studies have suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are promising anticancer agents. Biodegradable nanoparticulate systems have received considerable attention as potential drug delivery vehicles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of indomethacin-loaded nanocapsules and indomethacin ethyl ester-loaded nanocapsules on glioma cell lines. In addition, the effect of these formulations on normal neural tissue was also evaluated. In order to investigate this, glioma cell lines (U138-MG and C6) and hippocampal organotypic cultures were used. The main finding of the present study is that indomethacin-loaded nanocapsules formulation was more potent than a solution of indomethacin in decreasing the viability and cell proliferation of glioma lines. Indomethacin and indomethacin ethyl ester associated together in the same nanocapsule formulation caused a synergic effect decreasing glioma cell proliferation. In addition, when the glioma cells were exposed to 25 microM of indomethacin-loaded nanocapsules or indomethacin ethyl ester-loaded nanocapsules, a necrotic cell death was observed. Interestingly, 5 microM of indomethacin-loaded nanocapsules was able to cause an antiproliferative effect without promoting necrosis in glioma cells. Another important finding was that the cytotoxic effect induced by 25 microM or 50 microM of indomethacin-loaded nanocapsules or indomethacin ethyl ester-loaded nanocapsules, in glioma cells was not observed in the organotypic cultures, indicating selective cytotoxicity of those formulations for tumoral cells. Further investigations using in vivo glioma model should be helpful to confirm the distinct effects of indomethacin-loaded nanocapsules and indomethacin ethyl ester-loaded nanocapsules, in normal versus tumoral cells.
A 58-year-old man with chronic renal failure developed severe muscle pain and tenderness 1 week after starting bezafibrate 400 mg daily. Serum creatine kinase was 32,280 U/l. Muscle biopsy revealed scattered necrotic fibers and mild type 2b atrophy. Muscle total and free carnitine were at the upper limits of the normal range. Biochemical investigations of muscle homogenate showed normal carnitine pelmityl transferase (CPT) as well as normal individual glycolytic and mitochondrial enzyme activities. Withdrawal of the drug was followed by rapid clinical improvement. Our study casts doubt on the hypothesis that bezafibrate is able to affect muscle metabolic pathways. It is likely that the drug acts on cholesterol constituents of the muscle membrane, producing discontinuities of the sarcolemma and initiating cell necrosis.
The objective of this study was to study the clinical course and outcome of warfarinised patients who were hospitalised because of head trauma.
13 patients (ten males and three females; median age 69 years) who presented to the Royal Perth Hospital, Australia and who had suffered a head injury between July 1994 and June 2000 while concurrently taking warfarin, were studied.
Confusion was the commonest presenting symptom (four patients). Five patients presented after more than 24 hours of the injury. Eight patients were anticoagulated for thromboembolic disease and five for atrial fibrillation. The patients had a median injury severity score of 25 (range 1-43). The median international normalised ratio was 2.4 (range 1.8-10) on admission and 1.8 (range 1.0-10) on discharge. 11 of the 13 patients had computed tomography of the head. Intracerebral bleeding was the commonest injury (nine patients). The median length of hospital stay was six days (range 3-30). Five patients died (38.5%).
Warfarinised patients who sustain minor head trauma should be hospitalised for close neurological observation and should have a low threshold for performing computed tomography.
