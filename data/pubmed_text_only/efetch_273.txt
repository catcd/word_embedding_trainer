Amphotericin B deoxycholate is associated with infusion-related toxicity and renal toxicity.
To evaluate medical indications of this compound in a tertiary care center, analyze adverse reactions, infusion protocols and outcome of treated patients.
Retrospective analysis of 39 treatments indicated in 33 patients during 2007, exploring indications, infusion protocols and renal protective measures, infusion-related adverse reactions, nephrotoxicity, hypokalemia and outcomes.
On average, therapy lasted 12 days (2 to 39) and reached 600 mg of accumulated dose (100 to 1950) respectively. 24-hours infusions were applied in 63.2% of prescriptions and 35.9% received a 4-6 hour infusion schedule. In addition, 36.8% received daily a saline infusion before amphotericin. Adverse reactions were observed in 40% of treatments, predominating fever (25%). Nonetheless, nephrotoxicity was infrequent (9.4%), of low magnitude, only affecting patients without previous renal disease, and not requiring dialysis. Hypokalemia developed in 21.6% of treatments. More than half of medical indications were empirical (59%), for presumed infections by either filamentous fungi or yeasts. In the subgroup with microbiological information, main indications were invasive aspergillosis (15.4% of total), systemic candidiasis (12.8%) or meningeal cryptococcosis (10.3%). A favorable response was registered in 41%, and only 48.5% of patients survived. In a multivariate analysis, only age > 60 years remained as an independent factor for developing infusion-related adverse reactions. In the same manner, a SOFA score > 3 and corticosteroids administration at the same time than amphotericin B, were independently associated to a fatal outcome.
infusion-related adverse reactions are frequent during amphotericin B deoxycholate therapy, but renal toxicity is occasionally observed. Amphotercin B was used mainly as empirical therapy in this study.
We report a 34-year-old woman who, soon after a caesarian delivery with anesthesia by intrathecal bupivacaine hydrochloride injection, developed severe headache and high fever. Whereas C-reactive protein in the serum was normal, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed an increase in cell count (3,040/mm(3); mostly polymorphonuclear cells) and total protein (401 mg/dl), but only mildly decreased glucose content. No organisms were found by CSF staining and culture. Brain MRI scans were normal. Within 10 days after onset, her clinical conditions and CSF returned to normal. Considering previous reports, intrathecal bupivacaine hydrochloride seemed to be the most likely culprit for the development of chemical meningitis in our case.
Bilateral congenital cataracts are often characterized by morphology, etiology, and related conditions. We report a case of unique congenital cataracts with triangular morphology and associated prenatal methamphetamine exposure. Although this association is likely coincidental, the cataract's morphology in light of the specific timing of prenatal drug use deserves reporting.
Mild hypotension (drops of systolic blood pressure of > or = 20 mmHg) occurs in 14-38% of dobutamine stress echo (DSE) and carries a good prognosis for subsequent cardiac events. The incidence and significance of more profound hypotension (PH) (> or = 50 mmHg) is unknown.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of PH during DSE and its prognosis for subsequent cardiac events.
We reviewed 617 DSE performed at our institution between 1992 and 1996 and identified two DSE subgroups. The first group (PH group) consisted of all patients with PH during DSE. A second group was selected with baseline characteristics similar to the PH group but without PH during DSE (non-PH group). Follow-up was by a physician chart review and direct telephone contact. Cardiac event rates were determined for hard [myocardial infarction (MI), or cardiac death] and soft (angina, congestive heart failure, coronary angioplasty, or coronary bypass surgery) events occurring after the DSE.
Of the 617 DSE performed, 16 (3%) patients developed PH (PH group) during DSE, with 13 showing no inducible ischemia. The hard and soft cardiac event rate in this 13 PH group was 46% (mean follow-up of 28.7 +/- 18 months). Of the non-PH group, 32 patients had a negative DSE with a coronary event rate of 12.5%. Profound hypotension correlated with a significantly higher cardiac event rate (p < 0.02).
The incidence of PH during DSE is low (3%) and appears to predict a worse prognosis for subsequent cardiac events.
Skin infiltration of local anesthetics causes pain. In a double-blinded protocol, 22 volunteers received random intradermal injections to the volar surface of the forearm with each of the following solutions: normal saline solution 0.9% (NSS), lidocaine 1% (L), lidocaine 1% and sodium bicarbonate 8.4% (L+BIC), 2-chloroprocaine 2% (CP), 2-chloroprocaine 2% and sodium bicarbonate 8.4% (CP+BIC), and NaCHO(3) 8.4% (BIC). Initially, each volunteer received an open-labeled injection of NSS. A 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS, 1-100) was used to assess pain with each injection. The pH of each solution was stable for the length of the study. Repeated measures of variance were used for analysis. The VAS scores (mean +/- SD) for open-label and blinded NSS injections were 15.5 +/- 15.9 and 14.0 +/- 18.1, respectively. The scores for the studied solutions were as follows: BIC, 47.2 +/- 25.5; L, 25.8 +/- 27.6; L+BIC, 16.0 +/- 14.2; CP, 8.6 +/- 7.4; and CP+BIC, 6.8 +/- 6.7. No significant difference was found between CP and alkalinized CP, but the injection of both solutions was significantly less painful than that of all other solutions (P < 0.05). The pH of the solutions was not related to the pain score. We found that chloroprocaine caused less pain at injection than the more commonly used lidocaine.
Using 2-chloroprocaine can diminish pain caused by the intradermal injection of lidocaine. pH variations of the solution did not relate to the pain profile of the local anesthetic.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Current standard practices for treatment of HCC are less than satisfactory because of metastasis and recurrence. In addition to treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), arsenic trioxide (As2O3) also suppresses other solid tumors, such as HCC. However, the effects of As2O3 on the migration/invasion potential of liver cancer cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying in remain unclear. Here we found that As2O3 attenuated the migration/invasion potential of HCC cell lines by blocking matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activities and inducing a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). Indeed, As2O3 elevated the expression of microRNA-491 (miR-491) via demethylation. On one hand, as a target miRNA of MMP9, miR-491 decreased the MMP9 expression. On the other hand, miR-491 blocked the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which transcriptionally inactivated MMP2 and induced a MET (as determined by the increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expressions of snail, slug, and vimentin). Knockdown of miR-491 abolished the As2O3-induced MMPs inactivation, MET, and the migration/invasion potential of HCC cell lines. By understanding a novel mechanism how As2O3 inhibits the migration/invasion potential of liver cancer cells, our study may help to identify potential therapeutic targets for liver cancer.
We report 5 cases of acute visual and auditory neurotoxicity in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving desferrioxamine. Four patients complained of visual toxicity characterized by a decrease in visual acuity, loss of color vision and night blindness. In these patients there was a decrease in visual acuity, and the Farnsworth's test revealed a tritanopy (yellow-blue axis impairment); 1 patient also showed retinal pigmentary changes. A fifth patient complained of bilateral and severe neurosensorial deafness. Patients improved clinically upon drug-withdrawal. We recommend careful monitoring of audiovisual toxicity in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving this drug.
The gene encoding c-ABL, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, is involved in a chromosomal translocation resulting in expression of a BCR-Abl fusion protein that causes most chronic myelogenous and some acute lymphocytic leukemias (CML and ALL) in humans. The Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) expresses an alternative form of c-Abl, v-Abl, that transforms murine pro-B cells, resulting in acute leukemia and providing an experimental model for human disease. Gleevec (STI571) inhibits the Abl kinase and has shown great utility against CML and ALL in humans, although its usefulness is limited by acquired resistance. Since STI571 is active against A-MuLV-transformed cells in vitro, we performed a retroviral cDNA library screen for genes that confer resistance to apoptosis induced by STI571. We found that forced expression of Cdk6 promotes continued cell division and decreased apoptosis of leukemic cells. We then determined that the transcription factor E2A negatively regulates Cdk6 transcription in leukemic pro-B cells and that the v-Abl kinase stimulates Cdk6 expression via an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1-dependent pathway. Finally, we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor PD0332991 can act synergistically with STI571 to enhance leukemic cell death, suggesting a potential role for CDK6 inhibitors in the treatment of STI571-resistant CML or ALL.
The safety and tolerability of modafinil (400 mg/day, n = 14) and mirtazapine (60 mg/day, n = 13) in inpatient methamphetamine withdrawal treatment were compared to a historical comparison group receiving treatment as usual (pericyazine, 2.5-10 mg/day, n = 22). Modafinil and mirtazapine were well tolerated, producing minimal positive subjective effects and no discontinuation effects in this open-label study. Side effects were mild and transient. Aches and pains were most commonly reported by participants receiving mirtazapine, whereas headache was reported by modafinil-treated participants. Modafinil-treated participants had a milder withdrawal syndrome as measured by the Amphetamine Cessation Symptom Assessment and less sleep disturbance in comparison to mirtazapine. Pericyazine was associated with a more severe withdrawal syndrome in comparison to mirtazapine and modafinil. Both modafinil and mirtazapine were safe and well tolerated in methamphetamine withdrawal treatment. However, these early findings of efficacy in symptom amelioration should be replicated in an adequately powered, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind design.
The synthesis, pharmacological evaluation, and structure-activity relationships (SARs) of a series of novel arylalkylpiperazines structurally related to BP897 (3) are described. In binding studies, the new derivatives were tested against a panel of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline receptor subtypes. Focusing mainly on dopamine D(3) receptors, SAR studies brought to light a number of structural features required for high receptor affinity and selectivity. Several heteroaromatic systems were explored for their dopamine receptor affinities, and combinations of synthesis, biology, and molecular modeling, were used to identify novel structural leads for the development of potent and selective D(3) receptor ligands. Introduction of an indole ring linked to a dichlorophenylpiperazine system provided two of the most potent and selective ligands known to date (D(3) receptor affinity in the picomolar range). The intrinsic pharmacological properties of a subset of potent D(3) receptor ligands were also assessed in [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assays. Evidence from animal studies, in particular, has highlighted the dopaminergic system's role in how environmental stimuli induce drug-seeking behavior. We therefore tested two novel D(3) receptor partial agonists and a potent D(3)-selective antagonist in vivo for their effect in the cocaine-seeking behavior induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli after a long period of abstinence, and without any further cocaine. Compound 5 g, a nonselective partial D(3) receptor agonist with a pharmacological profile similar to 3, and 5p, a potent and selective D(3) antagonist, reduced the number of active lever presses induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli. However, 5q, a highly potent and selective D(3) partial agonist, did not have any effect on cocaine-seeking behavior. Although brain uptake studies are needed to establish whether the compounds achieve brain concentrations comparable to those active in vitro on the D(3) receptor, our experiments suggest that antagonism at D(2) receptors might significantly contribute to the reduction of cocaine craving by partial D(3) agonists.
Flestolol (ACC-9089) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes. This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min. In long-term infusion studies, flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days. Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta-adrenergic blockade. Flestolol produced a dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers. In contrast with other beta blockers, flestolol-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life. Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. In patients with unstable angina, flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain. It is concluded that flestolol is a potent, well-tolerated, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Use of flestolol in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation.
Levomepromazine (LMP) unexpectedly improved 16 of 23 chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients who were hospitalized in most cases for at least 2 years and who manifested positive symptoms, irritability and, in many cases, restlessness, hostility, uncooperativeness, poor concentration and aggressive behavior. Improvement led to discharge in 7 (6 to a foster home), placement on a waiting list for a foster home in 4 and improved behavior and autonomy in 5 patients. Five subjects developed seizures and 1 agranulocytosis. Whether improvement with LMP is caused by unique antischizophrenic properties or by diminished liability to induce side effects such as akathisia, a formal controlled study of LMP in treatment-resistant schizophrenia is merited.
Clinical investigation of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is limited because of lack of objective measurements and no consensus on use of a standard measuring tool. Currently, clinical trials use subject-completed diaries of dyskinesia throughout the day or investigator-administered clinical rating scales. An objective and valid method of measuring LID would reduce bias, variability, and decrease the time and number needed in trials of potential anti-dyskinetic agents. We have investigated using a force plate under standing subjects, which records movement of the center of pressure (CoP) to quantify LID over a levodopa (L-dopa) cycle. Twenty-two PD subjects (15 with LID, 7 without LID) admitted to an inpatient research facility had their PD meds withheld overnight, followed by a 2 hours intravenous L-dopa infusion the next day. The root mean squared of the velocity in the anterior-posterior direction (RMSV) derived from an analysis of the CoP, and, the modified Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (mAIMS) were performed repeatedly for 6 hours, initially as subjects were OFF before the infusion, through infusion until OFF again. There was a high correlation between the area under the curve (AUC) of the mAIMS and the RMSV within and between subjects. As a measure of LID, RMSV had excellent validity and reliability between subjects, and using a force plate was feasible. Sensitivity to changes in LID was initially demonstrated but should be repeated. Thus, CoP recordings on a force plate can objectively quantify LID in PD and may be very useful in clinical trials or other investigations of dyskinesia.
The efficacy and safety of esmolol, an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent (elimination half-life, 9 min), was investigated in 358 patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTs) in three multicenter studies (placebo-controlled, propranolol-controlled, and open-label baseline-controlled) and in 19 patients with myocardial ischemia (acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina) in a single-center, open-label study. Esmolol was infused intravenously in doses ranging from 25 micrograms/kg/min to 300 micrograms/kg/min. In SVT studies, efficacy was judged by one or more of the following: a reduction of at least 15% to 20% from the average baseline heart rate, heart rate less than 100 beats/min, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Results revealed that esmolol was superior to placebo and equal to propranolol in controlling heart rate in SVT patients. Conversion to NSR was comparable in patients treated with esmolol (14%) and in those treated with propranolol (16%). The majority of patients achieved therapeutic response at esmolol doses of 200 micrograms/kg/min or less. Among esmolol-treated patients, recovery from beta blockade (i.e., heart rate approaching baseline levels) was achieved within ten minutes after discontinuation of infusion, indicating a brief duration of action of esmolol. In contrast, beta blockade persisted 4.5 hours after discontinuation of propranolol. In patients with myocardial ischemia, esmolol effectively reduced heart rate and blood pressure, thereby decreasing rate-pressure product. The most frequent adverse effect in patients treated with esmolol was hypotension. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were reported in esmolol-treated patients. Esmolol was well tolerated in patients infused for durations of up to 24 hours and in patients with conditions for which treatment with beta blockers is inappropriate. These results suggest that esmolol effectively and rapidly controls the heart rate in patients with SVT and in patients with acute myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, because of its short half-life, esmolol offers excellent benefits as compared with the currently available beta-adrenergic blockers in the treatment of critically ill patients. Esmolol was well tolerated by patients for whom beta blockers in general would be unsuitable.
Turcot's syndrome is characterized clinically by the concurrence of a primary brain tumor and multiple colorectal adenomas. We attempted to define the syndrome at the molecular level.
Fourteen families with Turcot's syndrome identified in two registries and the family originally described by Turcot and colleagues were studied. Germ-line mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene characteristic of familial adenomatous polyposis were evaluated, as well as DNA replication errors and germline mutations in nucleotide mismatch-repair genes characteristic of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. In addition, a formal risk analysis for brain tumors in familial adenomatous polyposis was performed with a registry data base.
Genetic abnormalities were identified in 13 of the 14 registry families. Germ-line APC mutations were detected in 10. The predominant brain tumor in these 10 families was medulloblastoma (11 of 14 patients, or 79 percent), and the relative risk of cerebellar medulloblastoma in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis was 92 times that in the general population (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 269; P < 0.001). In contrast, the type of brain tumor in the other four families was glioblastoma multiforme. The glioblastomas and colorectal tumors in three of these families and in the original family studied by Turcot had replication errors characteristic of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. In addition, germ-line mutations in the mismatch-repair genes hMLH1 or hPMS2 were found in two families.
The association between brain tumors and multiple colorectal adenomas can result from two distinct types of germ-line defects: mutation of the APC gene or mutation of a mismatch-repair gene. Molecular diagnosis may contribute to the appropriate care of affected patients.
The goal of the present study was to examine the rate of cannabis use among participants in the Cognitive Assessment and Risk Evaluation (CARE) Program, a longitudinal program for individuals who are "at risk" for developing a psychotic disorder. Cannabis abuse was assessed in 48 individuals identified as at risk for psychosis based on subsyndromal psychotic symptoms and/or family history. At 1 year follow-up, 6 of the 48 (12.5%) at risk subjects had made the transition to psychosis. Of the 32 subjects who had no use or minimal cannabis use, one subject (3.1%) converted to psychosis. Of the 16 subjects who met criteria for cannabis abuse/dependence, five (31.3%) converted to psychosis. The results show a significant association between cannabis abuse and conversion to psychosis in this sample. Nicotine use was also found to be significantly associated with later conversion. The significant associations between cannabis and nicotine abuse and conversion to psychosis in individuals at risk for schizophrenia suggest that early identification and intervention programs should screen for and provide education about the deleterious effects of these substances.
There are studying the symptoms of development catalepsy at new home preparation, which is having the butirophenone's derivative. There are shown that the time development and manifestation of catalepsy are depending from preparation's dose: 0.1 mg/kg-1.3 mg/kg (maximum) -10 mg/kg in intravenous introduction and 1.2 mg/kg-3.5 mg/kg (maximum)-40 mg/kg in intraperitoneal introduction.
The formation of a reactive intermediate was found to be responsible for CYP3A4 metabolism-dependent inhibition (MDI) observed with (S)-N-[1-(3-morpholin-4-ylphenyl)ethyl]-3-phenyl-acrylamide (1). Structure-3A4 MDI relationship studies culminated in the discovery of a difluoro analogue, (S)-N-[1-(4-fluoro-3-morpholin-4-ylphenyl)ethyl]-3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)acrylamide (2), as an orally bioavailable KCNQ2 opener free of CYP3A4 MDI.
Hypertriglyceridaemia is a well known risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridaemia may be primary in origin or secondary to alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy or use of drugs. In this case report, the cause of acute pancreatitis was tamoxifen. We report on a patient with tamoxifen-induced acute pancreatitis and hypertriglyceridaemia who was successfully treated with insulin infusion and long-term gemfibrozil.
NSAIDs are widely used for patients presenting with low back pain. A quick-release formulation of lornoxicam, a potent NSAID from the chemical class of oxicams, offers a faster onset of pain relief compared with the standard tablet formulation.
Time to onset of pain relief with lornoxicam was compared with the quick-release formulation of diclofenac potassium in acute low back pain in a randomised, double-blind, multicentre study. 220 patients received either lornoxicam 24 mg or diclofenac potassium 150 mg on day 1 followed by lornoxicam 8 mg twice daily or diclofenac potassium 50 mg twice daily for 5 days. Efficacy outcomes included time to onset of pain relief, as measured by the stopwatch method (primary outcome), pain intensity, pain relief, rescue medication, ability to perform daily activities and global evaluation of the study medication.
The time to onset of pain relief ratios between diclofenac potassium/lornoxicam was 1.03 (95% CI 0.91, 1.26) and 1.05 (95% CI 0.93, 1.29) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses, respectively, demonstrating the non-inferiority of lornoxicam (defined by lower limits of the 95% CIs >0.80). Time to onset of pain relief was shorter with lornoxicam (30 minutes) compared with diclofenac potassium (36 minutes). The difference was not statistically significant (ITT analysis). A higher magnitude of analgesic effect associated with better global evaluation of the study medication for lornoxicam was also demonstrated. The drugs were equally well tolerated.
Lornoxicam administered as a quick-release formulation was shown to be non-inferior to the equivalent formulation of diclofenac potassium in terms of onset of pain relief and more effective on most of the major standard efficacy outcomes.
In vivo electrochemical recordings of the metabolism of catecholamines were obtained in the caudal ventrolateral medulla in anesthetized rats submitted to various experimental changes in systemic arterial pressure. Hypertension induced with phenylephrine and reversal of hypovolemia decreased the catechol metabolic activity. In contrast, controlled or hypovolemic hypotension, induced respectively with sodium nitroprusside or blood withdrawal (30% of blood volume), reversibly elicited the opposite pattern. This was suppressed by deafferentation. The changes in catechol metabolic activity in response to hypovolemia were accompanied by similar trends of variations of plasma vasopressin levels. By contrast with the increased catechol metabolic activity secondary to hypotension induced by either prazosin, sodium nitroprusside or hypovolemia, clonidine elicited a decrease in catechol metabolic activity. These data show a dynamic and specific involvement of the metabolism of catecholamines themselves promoted by changes in systemic arterial pressure. This pattern of functioning of catechol metabolism in the caudal ventrolateral medulla appears to be negatively related to systemic arterial pressure changes, a finding which does not fit with the proposed vasodepressor role of the A1-group.
Morphine is avoided by many neurosurgeons following cranial surgery. There exists a concern regarding the potential complications and a perception that cranial surgery is less painful than other surgical procedures. At British Columbia Children's Hospital continuous morphine infusions (CMI) have been used to control pain in pediatric neurosurgical patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of continuous intravenous morphine infusion to standard oral analgesics in a neurosurgical ward setting.
A retrospective review of medical records for 71 children was completed. The patients underwent either cranial reconstruction (2002-2007) or craniotomies for intradural pathology (2005-2007) at British Columbia Children's Hospital. Outcome measures included pain control and adverse events. Comparison was made between patients receiving a CMI and patients receiving acetaminophen and codeine.
Thirty-seven children received CMI on the ward (30 cranial reconstruction and 7 craniotomy), while 34 (10 cranial reconstruction and 24 craniotomy) received acetaminophen and codeine. There was no statistical difference in pain control. There was significantly more nausea on post-operative day one in the CMI group (p = 0.002). There were no other significant adverse events.
These findings suggest that CMI is comparable to acetaminophen and codeine with respect to analgesia and serious side effects. We recommend the use of CMIs as an alternative when pain is poorly controlled in post-operative pediatric neurosurgical patients to prevent the potential adverse consequences of inadequate analgesia.
To explore the therapeutic effect of three drugs, i.e., hydroxyprogesterone caproate (HPC), Tamoxifen (TMX) and Aminoglutethimide (AG), in the treatment of endometrial carcinoma.
The patients were collected by double-blind method and classified into 6 groups (3 groups used single drug and 3 groups used combined drugs) at random. The patient was given assigned drug therapy for 10 days according to her group after being admitted to the hospital. Operations were performed 7-10 days after drug therapy. Plasma FSH, LH, E2 and P were measured by standard radioimmunoassay of WHO. ER and PR in cancer tissues were examined by enzyme linked histochemistry. Cancer tissues obtained before and after drug therapy were examined pathologically.
The values of FSH, LH and E2 decreased and that of P increased after single drug therapy in the group treated with HPC; and the values of FSH, LH, E2 and P all decreased in the groups treated with TMX and AG respectively (P < 0.05). The values of FSH, LH and E2 decreased to different extent in the groups treated with combined drugs. The changes of FSH and E2 are remarkable (P < 0.05). The value of P increased a little with no statistical difference (P > 0.05). PR and ER usually increased after treatment with TMX, but decreased with HPC or AG, or combined drugs. The pathological changes indicate that the tumors responded to all of the three drugs. The response to TMX was most significant, following which was HPC.
HPC and TMX are two drugs proved to be useful in endometrial carcinoma. AG also can be used to treat endometrial carcinoma. It adds a new drug to the drug therapy for endometrial carcinoma.
2-Nitropropane (2-NP) is mutagenic in a number of short-term mutagenicity assays in vitro and in vivo, and is a potent hepatocarcinogen in rats. Many studies have determined that differences in the metabolism and disposition of the chemicals that produce mutagenicity were not responsible for their observed carcinogenic differences, but that carcinogenicity correlated with the ability of the respective isomer to induce cell proliferation in the target organ.
Three groups of male rats (control, 2-NP-treated [4 mmol/kg] and 2-NP + melatonin [10 mg/kg]) were used in the current study. Cell proliferation was quantitated by incorporation of 3H-thymidine, detected by autoradiography, into newly synthesized DNA. Histopatholgical study was carried out to investigate the morphological changes.
Twenty four hours after 2-NP administration, there was an increase in the labelling index (LI) and grain count per labelled nucleus (GC/N) in the hepatocytes of 2-NP-injected rats versus those of control animals. The increase was 69.5% in LI and 29.4% in GC/N. Melatonin treatment, 30 minutes preceding 2-NP, reduced the increase in LI (44.4%) and GC/N (20.7%) when compared with 2-NP-treated rats. Histopathology revealed multiple focal areas of necrosis in the liver following 2-NP injection. In the lung, there was a mucinous degeneration of the bronchial epithelium. Melatonin treatment restored the histopathological changes in both the liver and lung and they are more or less normal.
Overall, these results seem to indicate that the stimulatory effect of 2-NP on the cellular proliferation and the rate of DNA synthesis in the liver may be one of mechanisms by which the carcinogen induces its carcinogenic action. Also, melatonin treatment strongly protects the studied organs against the toxic effect of 2-NP.
Free radical genesis of disorder is one of the major subjects of discussion in the explanation of pathological conditions. In this study, the effects of micro molar quantities of sodium selenite treatment on diabetes-induced alterations in the antioxidant defense system were investigated.
Diabetes was induced by administration of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg body weight) and both diabetic and control animals were treated with sodium selenite (5 micromol/kg/day) for 4 weeks.
Our results have shown that induction of diabetes in the liver tissue of animals for 5 weeks resulted in decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) activities and concomitantly increased lipid peroxidation (LPO).
Sodium selenite treatment of the diabetic rats resulted in almost full restoration of all the parameters mentioned above. Metallothionein, which is known to be one of the major antioxidants and a central protein in heavy metal regulation, is altered by diabetes, and sodium selenite treatment restored this alteration as well.
Acetaminophen (AAP)-induced oxidative stress can cause cell death to induce liver damage. The antioxidant effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (HS) was shown in previous studies. In this study the effect of HS extract (HSE) on AAP-induced liver injury in BALB/c mice was investigated.
In vivo, BALB/c mice were fed orally with 200, 400 or 600 mg kg(-1) HSE for 2 weeks and then injected with 1000 mg kg(-1) AAP. Pretreatment with HSE decreased lipid peroxidation and increased catalase activity and glutathione level. It also decreased AAP-induced liver injury, accompanied by decreased expression of pJNK, Bax and tBid in the liver. Additionally, HSE protected BALB/c normal liver cells from AAP-induced damage in vitro.
It has been demonstrated that HSE can protect the mouse liver from AAP-induced injury and that the protective mechanism might involve decreasing oxidative stress and reducing cell death.
