Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs mediate anticancer effects by modulating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent and/or COX-2-independent mechanism(s); however, the toxicity issue is a concern with single agents at higher doses. In this study, we determined the combined effect of celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, along with exisulind (sulindac sulfone/Aptosyn) at low doses in prostate cancer.
We used a sequential regimen of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea + testosterone to induce prostate cancer in Wistar-Unilever rats. Following carcinogen treatment, celecoxib and exisulind individually and their combination at low doses were given in NIH-07 diet for 52 weeks. We determined the incidence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinomas, rate of tumor cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis were done to determine COX-2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Akt, androgen receptor, and cyclin D1 expression. Serum prostaglandin E2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme immunoassay/ELISA assays.
The rats that received celecoxib in combination with exisulind at low doses showed a significant decrease in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinomas as well as an enhanced rate of apoptosis. An overall decrease in COX-2, EGFR, Akt, androgen receptor, and cyclin D1 expression was found associated with tumor growth inhibition. Reduced serum levels of COX-2 protein, prostaglandin E2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha indicated anti-inflammatory effects. A strong inhibition of total and phosphorylated form of EGFR (Tyr(992) and Tyr(845)) and Akt (Ser(473)) was significant in rats given with these agents in combination.
In this study, we show for the first time that the combination of celecoxib with exisulind at low doses could prevent prostate carcinogenesis by altering key molecular events.
The present study investigated the protective effects of melatonin (MT) against gentamicin (GM)-induced nephrotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats. We also investigated the effects of MT on induction of apoptotic cell death and its potential mechanisms in renal tissues in response to GM treatment. The following four experimental groups were evaluated: (1) vehicle control, (2) MT (15 mg/kg/day), (3) GM (100 mg/kg/day), and (4) GM&MT. GM caused severe nephrotoxicity as evidenced by increased serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, increased renal tubular cell apoptosis, and increased Bcl2-associated X protein and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression. Additionally, GM treatment caused an increase in levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) protein expression in renal tissues. The significant decreases in glutathione content, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase activities and the increase in malondialdehyde content indicated that GM-induced tissue injury was mediated through oxidative reactions. In contrast, MT treatment protected kidney tissue against the oxidative damage and the nephrotoxic effect caused by the GM treatment. Histopathological studies confirmed the renoprotective effect of MT. These results indicate that MT prevents nephrotoxicity induced by GM in rats, presumably because it is a potent antioxidant, restores antioxidant enzyme activity, and blocks NF-κB and iNOS activation in rat kidney.
We report a case of an acute stroke patient with pulmonary embolism (PE) caused by delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She was treated with heparin to prevent neurological deterioration. However, 5 days after heparin had been given for 7 days, she developed PE. Heparin was re-started, but the platelet count decreased significantly, and a right ventricular thrombus appeared. She was finally diagnosed as having PE due to delayed-onset HIT because the HIT antibody was positive. When a patient develops thrombotic events during or after heparin therapy, the possibility of HIT should be considered.
Polyposis, asthma, aspirin-intolerance and aspirin-triad are mostly accompanied with eosinophilia of mucosal airways. Chemotactic cytokines, the CC-chemokines regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed (RANTES), eotaxin, and eotaxin-2 activate and attract eosinophilic leukocytes to the site of inflammation. This points to the implication of CC-chemokines in eosinophilia of nasal tissue of these diseases.
Therefore, nasal polypous tissue specimens of patients suffering from chronic nasal polypous sinusitis (NP), intrinsic asthma (ATA), aspirin-intolerance (AINA), and aspirin-triad (TRIAD) were investigated. The amount of mRNA and protein of CC-chemokines was analyzed using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and chemokine-specific enzyme-immuno-assays. The patterns of CC-chemokines were compared.
The mRNA-expression as well as protein synthesis of CC-chemokines was quantified in all tissues investigated. The expression of RANTES-mRNA in NP, ATA, AINA, and TRIAD (averaging 148-324% D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and protein synthesis (0.13-0.15 ng/mg tissue weight) did not differ significantly. But the protein synthesis of eotaxin- and eotaxin-2-mRNA was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in TRIAD (3.3 pg/mg and 3.4 ng/mg tissue weight) (4 ng/mg tissue weight), than in NP, ATA, or AINA (1.8 pg/mg and 2.1 ng/mg, 2.1 pg/mg and 1.6 ng/mg, or 1.7 pg/mg and 2.2 ng/mg tissue weight, respectively).
Patients suffering from TRIAD in association with tissue eosinophilia were characterized by elevated eotaxin and eotaxin-2 mRNA-expression as well as protein-synthesis. This pointed to the implication of eotaxins and RANTES in eosinophilia-associated diseases. Further studies will have to prove, whether the analysis of these chemokines might improve the diagnosis of eosinophilia associated polyposis and initiate the development of new therapeutic strategies.
The olfactory system of salmonids is sensitive to the adverse effects of metals such as copper and cadmium. In the current study, we analyzed olfactory-mediated alarm responses, epithelial injury and recovery, and a suite of olfactory molecular biomarkers encoding genes critical in maintaining olfactory function in juvenile coho salmon receiving acute exposures to cadmium (Cd). The molecular biomarkers analyzed included four G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) representing the two major classes of odorant receptors (salmon olfactory receptor sorb and vomeronasal receptors svra, svrb, and gpr27), as well as markers of neurite outgrowth (nrn1) and antioxidant responses to metals, including heme oxygenase 1 (hmox1), and peroxiredoxin 1 (prdx1). Coho received acute (8-168 h) exposures to 3.7 ppb and 347 ppb Cd, and a subset of fish was analyzed following a 16-day depuration. Coho exposed to 347 ppb Cd over 48 h exhibited a reduction in freeze responses, and an extensive loss of olfaction accompanied by histological injury to the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory injury in coho exposed to 347 ppb Cd was accompanied at the gene level by significant decreases in expression of the olfactory GPCRs and increased expression of hmox1. Persistent behavioral deficits, histological injury and altered expression of a subset of olfactory biomarkers were still evident in Cd-exposed coho following a 16-day depuration in clean water. Exposure to 3.7 ppb Cd also resulted in reduced freeze responses and histological changes to the olfactory epithelium within 48 h of Cd exposure, although the extent of olfactory injury was less severe than observed for fish in the high dose Cd group. Furthermore adverse behavioral effects were present in some coho receiving the low dose of Cd following a 16-day depuration. In summary, acute exposures to environmental levels of Cd can cause olfactory injury in coho salmon that may persist following depuration. Mechanism-based biomarkers of oxidative stress and olfactory structures can augment the evaluation of olfactory injury manifested at the physiological level.
Mirtazapine is a new antidepressant with a tetracyclic chemical structure that is not related to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The antidepressant effect results from stimulation of the noradrenergic system through antagonism at central (alpha2-inhibitory receptors. Clonidine exerts its antihypertensive effect by stimulating these receptors to cause a reduction in endogenous release of norepinephrine. Therefore, the two agents have mechanisms of action that potentially oppose one another. We report a case of hypertensive urgency that ensued after a patient stabilized on clonidine began taking mirtazapine.
Adenosine triphosphate as well as sodium nitroprusside has been used for hypotensive anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to examine the possibility that two hypotensive drugs may exert different effects on venous capacitance during controlled hypotension. In rats anesthetized with ketamine, mean arterial pressure was lowered to 50 mmHg by intravenous infusion of adenosine triphosphate or sodium nitroprusside. Venous capacitance was assessed before and during induced hypotension by measuring the mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP). MCFP was measured after briefly arresting the circulation by inflating an indwelling balloon in the right atrium. MCFP was lower during adenosine triphosphate-induced as well as sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension as compared with the respective value at control (P < 0.01 for adenosine triphosphate and sodium nitroprusside). However, the decrease in MCFP by adenosine triphosphate (0.8 +/- 0.1 mmHg) was less (P < 0.01) than that by sodium nitroprusside (2.3 +/- 0.3 mmHg). These results suggest that at a comparable level of arterial hypotension venodilator effect of adenosine triphosphate was less than that of sodium nitroprusside. Less venodilatation during adenosine triphosphate-induced hypotension may contribute to the maintenance of cardiac output during hypotensive anesthesia.
A rare cause of limb amputation is heparin-associated thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HATT). There have been no case reports in the rehabilitation literature of lower extremity amputation secondary to HATT. Three case reports are presented to illustrate how HATT can develop and cause limb ischemia with subsequent amputation. HATT occurs in less than 1% of patients receiving heparin, has an immunological basis for its etiology, and is diagnosed both clinically and with laboratory confirmation. In addition, there are various treatment options, with the most fundamental being cessation of heparin therapy. HATT does present in the rehabilitation setting and physiatrists should be prepared to diagnose and manage it effectively.
A 65-year-old man underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation and was prophylactically treated for cytomegalovirus infection with intravenous ganciclovir. He received standard dosages and had normal renal function. After 6 days of therapy he experienced psychotic symptoms with hallucinations, confusion, and disorientation. His altered mental status resolved after the drug had been discontinued for 5 days. Ganciclovir was suspected as a cause of the symptoms. Alternative etiologies of were explored and excluded.
Clinical use of doxorubicin is limited by its cardiotoxicity. In doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, vacuolization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) has been reported. We investigated whether doxorubicin had a direct action on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in isolated perfused rat hearts. The left and right atria were trimmed to maintain heart rate (HR) <200 beats/min. Postrest contractions, which are believed to be due primarily to Ca2+ release from the SR, were evoked with a programmable stimulator after variable rest intervals. The amplitude of the postrest contractions increased markedly as the rest interval increased. Doxorubicin (0.1 mM) significantly suppressed this potentiation of the postrest contractions. Furthermore, doxorubicin slowly induced aftercontractions and an increase in left ventricular diastolic pressure (LVDP), phenomena that are usually associated with ouabain intoxication. We conclude that doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy may be due to SR dysfunction, leading to intracellular Ca2+ overload.
The lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase LYP, encoded by the PTPN22 gene, is a critical regulator of signaling in T cells and recently emerged as a candidate target for therapy of autoimmune diseases. Here, by library screening, we identified a series of noncompetitive inhibitors of LYP that showed activity in primary T cells. Kinetic analysis confirmed that binding of the compounds to the phosphatase is nonmutually exclusive with respect to a known bidentate competitive inhibitor. The mechanism of action of the lead inhibitor compound 4e was studied by a combination of hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry and molecular modeling. The results suggest that the inhibitor interacts critically with a hydrophobic patch located outside the active site of the phosphatase. Targeting of secondary allosteric sites is viewed as a promising yet unexplored approach to develop pharmacological inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Our novel scaffold could be a starting point to attempt development of "nonactive site" anti-LYP pharmacological agents.
The post-marketing surveillance of edaravone has reported serious adverse reactions, including renal and hepatic disorders. Renal disorders were the most frequently reported serious/important adverse reactions, which led to the evaluation of their causation by edaravone, their severity, and the recovery of renal function.
A retrospective review was carried out of 207 Japanese patients with acute stroke who developed renal disorders on edaravone treatment.
No particular factor other than edaravone was found as a possible cause of the renal disorders in 17 patients (8.2%). In 91.8% of the patients evaluated, factors other than edaravone were associated with the development of renal disorders. Severe deterioration of systemic status (e.g., a severe infection or a decrease in blood pressure) was considered to be a highly probable cause of renal disorders that occurred before or during treatment with edaravone in 135 patients (65.2%). Fifty-nine patients (28.5%) underwent blood purification treatment (BPT). In the remaining 148 patients without BPT, the peak serum creatinine (SCr) level during follow-up was 3 mg/dl or more in 93 patients (44.9%) and less than 3 mg/dl in 55 patients (26.6%). The severity of renal disorders was moderate to severe in 73.3% of the 207 patients, and renal function recovered in 43%.
Appropriate treatment of deteriorated systemic status and the discontinuation of edaravone administration following the early discovery of renal disorders are recommended to reduce the development of severe renal disorders during edaravone treatment. The precise role(s) of edaravone in the pathogenesis of renal disorders should be evaluated in the future.
This study examined the effects of posttraining administration of substance P (SP) and of certain N- or C-terminal SP-fragments on retention performance of rats treated with diazepam (DZP). Twenty minutes before the training on an inhibitory avoidance task rats were given intraperitoneal injections of either DZP (2 mg/kg) or vehicle. Immediately after they were injected with SP (50 micrograms/kg), SPN 1-7 (167 micrograms/kg), SPC 6-11 (134 micrograms/kg), or vehicle. The posttrial administration of SP and SPN, but not SPC, facilitated avoidance behavior. Animals that received DZP before training and vehicle after the conditioning trial showed impaired retention. In contrast, in animals injected with SP and SPN after the training trial, DZP did not affect retention. These findings suggest that the amnestic effects of DZP can be blocked by the administration of SP and that the amino acid sequence responsible for this effect may be encoded by its N-terminal part.
Effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) on maleic dialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and total antioxidation capability (T-AOC) were compared in mice at different postnatal developmental stages, and concentrations and distributions of PFOS in different tissues were measured simultaneously. The male and female mice at postnatal day (PD) 7, PD 14, PD 21, PD 28 and PD 35 were distributed randomly to dosage group (50 mg/kg body weight) and control group (0 mg/kg body weight). Mice were administered with PFOS by once subcutaneous injection. Subsequently, after 24 hr, MDA content, SOD activity and T-AOC in brain and liver were analyzed. The PFOS concentrations in blood, brain and liver were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography negative electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). PFOS induced degression of the body weights of mice evidently and increase of relative weights of liver. Meanwhile, it depressed the SOD activity and T-AOC in brain and liver. The concentrations and distribution percentages of PFOS in blood, brain and liver of mice were significantly different at various postnatal developmental stages. Achieved results in this study indicate that younger mice pups were more sensitive to PFOS exposure. In addition, significant distinctions in concentrations and distribution percentages of PFOS in various tissues were demonstrated in this study. The gender difference observed was greater in the older mice. Thus it is worth giving attention especially to adverse effects of PFOS on foetus and children.
A case is presented of a 65 years old woman with a rheumatoid arthritis III stage who had developed a nephrotic syndrome due to the treatment with Feloran. The biopsy examination showed the pathomorphologic pattern of glomerulonephritis with minimum changes. The discontinuance of the Feloran treatment led to a full disappearance of the nephrotic syndrome. It is recommended that Feloran treatment should not be applied to patients with previous renal lesions.
Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and AP-1 nuclear transcriptional factors regulate expression of multiple genes involved in tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis; however, the relative contribution of each factor to cancer initiation and progression has not been established. Prostate carcinogenesis involves transformation of normal zinc-accumulating epithelial cells to malignant cells that do not accumulate zinc. Whereas activation of both NF-kappaB and AP-1 has been implicated in prostate cancer development and growth, we tested the relative effects of zinc supplementation on these important transcriptional factors. Herein, we demonstrate that physiological levels of zinc inhibit NF-kappaB but augment activities of AP-1 in DU-145 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. Additionally, we show that chelation of zinc with membrane-permeable zinc chelator, N,N,N',N',-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) abolishes this effect. We further propose a potential mechanism for this observation by demonstrating that zinc supplementation induces phosphorylation of the members of three major MAPK subfamilies regulating AP-1 and NF-kappaB activation (ERK 1/2, JNK and p38) while blocking TNF-alpha-mediated degradation of the inhibitory subunit I kappa B alpha and nuclear translocation of RelA in prostate cancer cells. VEGF, IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-9 are major pro-angiogenic and pro-metastatic molecules whose promoter regions contain binding sites for both NF-kappaB and AP-1. These cytokines have been associated with negative prognostic features in prostate cancer. We demonstrate that treatment of human prostate cancer cell lines with zinc reduces expression of VEGF, IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-9. We further show that zinc reduces expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and functionally suppresses tumor cell invasiveness and adhesion. Therefore, the ability of zinc supplementation to inhibit NF-kappaB supercedes zinc-mediated activation of AP-1 family members. Upregulation of intracellular zinc levels may have important implications for inhibiting the angiogenic and metastatic potentials of malignant cells, predominantly through suppression of NF-kappaB signaling.
Two patients presented with progressive cognitive impairment and parkinsonism related symptoms while being treated with sodium valproate. Both patients suffered from progressive cognitive decline and mobility disorders with an insidious onset over a period of months to years. After discontinuation of sodium valproate both debilitating symptoms resolved nearly completely. There is a growing prevalence and incidence of epilepsy above the age of 60 and a great number of these patients are on sodium valproate treatment. All clinicians treating elderly patients should be aware of the fact that this treatment can cause reversible cognitive decline and parkinsonism probably due to impairment of mitochondrial complex I function. Discontinuation of sodium valproate is strongly recommended in all patients with development of cognitive impairment or parkinsonism or both during sodium valproate treatment.
The present experiment was designed to investigate the role of peripheral dopamine D1-like receptors and to evaluate the prophylactic effect of zelandopam, a dopamine D1-like receptor agonist, on puromycin aminonucleoside (PA)-induced nephrosis in rats. Rats were divided into six groups (n=10 per group): 0.9% saline-injected rats (control); PA-injected rats (PAN); PA-injected rats treated with the selective dopamine D1-like receptor agonist zelandopam (30, 100, 300 mg/kg p.o. twice a day); PA-injected rats treated with prednisolone (1 mg/kg p.o. once a day). Nephrosis was induced in rats with a single intravenous injection of PA at a dose of 50 mg/kg. The effects of zelandopam and prednisolone in PA nephrosis rats were evaluated before injection of PA and at 7 and 14 days after injection. PA-induced nephrosis was characterized by an increase in urinary protein excretion (proteinuria) and plasma total cholesterol. Zelandopam dose-dependently attenuated the increase in proteinuria and total cholesterol. Prednisolone significantly attenuated the increase in proteinuria and total cholesterol and resulted in a significant decrease in body weight. The present study demonstrates for the first time that zelandopam, a selective dopamine D1-like receptor agonist, is effective in blunting the development of PA-induced nephrosis, and that the effects of zelandopam are dose dependent.
Through the application of TRAP (target-related affinity profiling), we identified a novel class of heteroaroylphenylureas that inhibit human CCL2-induced chemotaxis of monocytes/macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. This inhibition was concentration-dependent and selective with regard to other chemokines. The compounds, however, did not antagonize the binding of (125)I-labeled CCL2 to the CCR2 receptor nor did they block CCR2-mediated signal transduction responses such as calcium mobilization. Optimization of early leads for potency and pharmacokinetic parameters resulted in the identification of 17, a potent inhibitor of chemotaxis (IC(50) = 80 nM) with excellent oral bioavailability in rats (F = 60%). Compound 17 reduced swelling and joint destruction in two rat models of rheumatoid arthritis and delayed disease onset and produced near complete resolution of symptoms in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis.
Mice of the C57BL/6J strain became hyperactive to increasing doses of morphine sulfate. This response was similar to locomotor hyperactivity induced by amphetamine. Lesions and chemical blockade of posterior n. accumbens abolished amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and reduced but did not abolish the morphine response. These experiments demonstrate that the response to the two drugs is mediated by overlapping but noncongruent neural systems.
Retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), as an adipocyte secreted cytokine, was recently found to be inversely correlated with expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in insulin resistance (IR) state and to have an intimate relationship with IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-diabetic efficacy of cinnamaldehyde (Cin), berberine (Ber), and metformin (Met) as well as their impacts on the RBP4-GLUT4 system.
Rat models of T2DM were established by combination of intraperitoneal injection of low-dose streptozotocin and high fat diet induction. Rats were divided into five groups: the control group, the diabetes group, the diabetes + Ber group, the diabetes + Cin group, and the diabetes + Met group. Western blotting was used to detect the serum or tissue RBP4 and GLUT4 protein levels.
After treatment for four weeks, both Cin and Ber displayed significant hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, and insulin sensitizing functions (P < 0.01) compared with the control group. Their effects on lowering fasting plasma glucose (FPG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) seem even better than that of Met. Cin and Ber markedly lowered serum RBP4 levels and up-regulated the expression of tissue GLUT4 protein, and Cin seemed more notable in affecting these two proteins.
Both Cin and Ber display an exciting anti-diabetic efficacy in this study and may be of great value for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Their mechanisms involve the RBP4-GLUT4 system, during which the serum RBP4 levels are lowered and the expression of tissue GLUT4 protein is up-regulated.
A case is reported of fatal aplastic anemia developing in a 50-year-old woman who received lithium carbonate in the generally accepted dosage for a manic-depressive disorder. The serum lithium had been determined at regular intervals and never exceeded what is considered a safe level. Patients for whom lithium is prescribed should have periodic hematologic examinations.
The pI50 index and separation coefficients of chosen 3-N,N-diethylaminophenyl-N',N'-dialkylcarbamates were determined. Index pL50 (pI50 = negative logarithm of molar concentration of inhibitor inhibiting the enzyme activity by 50%) describes the effectiveness of the inhibitor. The rate of ability of the inhibitor to pass the blood-brain barrier is usually described by the separation coefficient in a system n-octanol/water (K(ow)). Obtained results were compared with pL50 and K(ow) of Exelon, the commercially used drug against the Alzheimer's disease.
