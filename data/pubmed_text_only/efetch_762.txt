The main treatment of asctrocytomas is surgery, which serves a double purpose: diagnosis and treatment. Surgery can be complemented with radiotherapy. With respect to chemotherapy, there continues to be a controversy as to whether it has the capacity to overcome the blood-brain barrier. An interesting option has been the implantation of biodegradable polymers of carmustine that are placed in the cavity left by the surgical procedure. With respect to the cerebral edema that can be associated with the carmustine implants, there can appear images in follow-up that are suggestive of relapse.
Tobacco exposure is implicated in many illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, but the mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood. The mechanisms by which tobacco induces pro-sympathetic and pro-inflammatory changes also remain elusive. Some studies have attributed these changes to the direct effects of nicotine, but such findings run counter to the pro-vagal, anti-inflammatory nature of the nicotinic pathway. We hypothesize that the illnesses associated with smoking may be partly attributable to autonomic dysfunction, sympathetic bias, and T helper (Th)2 inflammation induced by a paradoxical compensatory response to intermittent nicotinic exposure. The confusion of interpreting the adrenergia and inflammation associated with nicotine as a primary response instead of a secondary compensation may be explained by the unusually rapid absorption, action, and serum elimination of nicotine. Given the fast action and clearance of nicotine, even heavy smokers spend large portions of the day and the entire night in nicotine withdrawal, at which time rebound sympathetic bias may manifest as a result of desensitization of nicotinic receptors. This may help reconcile why the features observed in smokers such as tachycardia, hypertension, inflammation, insomnia, and anxiety, which are perhaps mistakenly attributed to the direct action of nicotine, are identical to those seen during acute nicotine withdrawal after smoking cessation. On the other hand, delayed responses to cessation of smoking such as weight gain and increased heart rate variability are compatible with reduced sympathovagal ratio and resensitization of nicotinic receptors. Sympathetic bias and the associated Th2 inflammation underlie many systemic diseases. Tobacco-related cancers may be partly attributable to immunomodulatory properties of chronic nicotine exposure by dampening Th1 immunity and enabling tumoral evasion of immune surveillance. Other conditions associated with tobacco exposure may also operate through similar autonomic and immune dysfunctions. Therapeutic implications are discussed.
Radioiodine therapy of nonthyroid cancers after sodium iodide symporter (NIS) gene delivery has been proposed as a potential application of gene therapy. However, it seems to be precluded by the rapid efflux of taken up iodine from most transduced xenografted tumors. We present an in vivo kinetic study of NIS-related hepatic iodine uptake in an aggressive model of hepatocarcinoma induced by diethylnitrosamine in immunocompetent Wistar rats. We followed the whole-body iodine distribution by repeated imaging of live animals. We constructed a rat NIS (rNIS) adenoviral vector, Ad-CMV-rNIS, using the cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a promoter. Injected in the portal vein in 5 healthy and 25 hepatocarcinoma-bearing rats and liver tumors in 9 hepatocarcinoma-bearing rats, Ad-CMV-rNIS drove expression of a functional NIS protein by hepatocytes and allowed marked (from 20 to 30% of the injected dose) and sustained (>11 days) iodine uptake. This contrasts with the massive iodine efflux found in vitro in human hepatic tumor cell lines. In vivo specific inhibition of NIS by sodium perchlorate led to a rapid iodine efflux from the liver, indicating that the sustained uptake was not attributable to an active retention mechanism but to permanent recycling of the effluent radioiodine via the high hepatic blood flow. Radioiodine therapy after Ad-CMV-rNIS administration achieved a strong inhibition of tumor growth, the complete regression of small nodules, and prolonged survival of hepatocarcinoma-bearing rats. This demonstrates for the first time the efficacy of NIS-based radiotherapy in a relevant preclinical model of nonthyroid human carcinogenesis.
Status of glomerular proteoglycans (PGs) in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was investigated. Rats were made nephrotic and sacrificed 0, 7, 14, and 21 days later. Maximal proteinuric response was observed between 7 and 14 days. Prior to sacrifice, they received injections of conjugated or unconjugated anti-heparan-sulfate-proteoglycan antibody, directed against its core protein (Mr = 18,000). Their kidneys were processed for direct and indirect immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase, tannic-acid staining, and tissue autoradiography (ARG). By tannic-acid staining, antibody binding sites identical to the anionic sites described previously were discovered. No qualitative differences were observed by these immunohistochemical techniques. Quantitative tissue ARG did not reveal any statistical differences in the binding of antibody between the control and nephrotic groups. For de novo biosynthetic studies, rats were sacrificed on day 10. Their kidneys were utilized for labeling of basement membrane PGs by employing [35S]-sulfate as the precursor product. Tissue ARG, as well as biochemical studies, were performed on the radiolabeled glomeruli. PGs were extracted with 4 M GuCl and characterized by Sepharose CL-6B and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. There was an overall increase in the total incorporated radioactivities in the glomerular and media fractions. No differences were observed in the macromolecular size characteristics of intact PGs and glycosaminoglycan chains of either glomerular or media fractions. However, an increase in the charge-density characteristics was observed in PGs of the nephrotic group. By tissue ARG, an increase in the grain densities over the basement membrane and mesangial matrices of the glomerulus was noted. These data indicate that the intact PGs, their chains and core protein do not undergo significant biochemical alterations; however, de novo synthesized PGs have higher charge-density characteristics which may be related to a higher degree of sulfation that occurs during the course of aminonucleoside nephrosis.
Hydroxyurea (HU) has been used in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) to reduce the frequency and severity of thrombotic complications of the disease. It acts by causing bone marrow depression, resulting in a decrease in platelet and leukocyte counts and in anemia with megaloblastosis. Herein we report a case of an 80-year-old man with ET who developed severe hemolytic anemia requiring multiple packed RBC transfusions while being treated with HU. The hemolysis persisted until discontinuation of the drug. This case suggests hemolysis as a potential side effect of HU and raises the clinical concern that not all HU-induced anemia is secondary to erythropoiesis depression. With the increasing use of HU in the management of ET, hemoglobinopathy, and other diseases, the importance of monitoring for hemolysis must be further emphasized in these patients.
Mosaic variegated aneuploidy is a rare recessive condition characterized by growth retardation, microcephaly, childhood cancer and constitutional mosaicism for chromosomal gains and losses. In five families with mosaic variegated aneuploidy, including two with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, we identified truncating and missense mutations of BUB1B, which encodes BUBR1, a key protein in the mitotic spindle checkpoint. These data are the first to relate germline mutations in a spindle checkpoint gene with a human disorder and strongly support a causal link between aneuploidy and cancer development.
In studies conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, treatment with either paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) or carboplatin was associated with an improvement in 1-year survival in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Based on these findings, a phase II trial of carboplatin plus paclitaxel was conducted in patients with advanced NSCLC to determine the activity and toxicity of this regimen. Eligibility requirements included stage IIIB or IV histologically confirmed NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, no prior chemotherapy, and adequate hematologic, renal, hepatic, and cardiac functions. Paclitaxel was administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg/m2 (28 patients) or 175 mg/m2 (23 patients), followed by a 1-hour infusion of carboplatin on day 2. Carboplatin was administered at a dose of 300 mg/m2 (16 patients) or, using the Calvert formula, a dose calculated to achieve an area under the concentration-time curve of 6 mg/mL x min (35 patients). Treatment was repeated every 28 days for a total of six cycles. Among the 51 eligible patients, 34 were men and 17 were women; their median age was 60 years and their median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1. Six patients had stage IIIB and 45 had stage IV disease. Grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 47% and 3% of treatment cycles, respectively. The most common nonhematologic toxicities noted included nausea and emesis, neuropathy, and arthralgia and myalgia. There were no complete responses and 14 partial responses, for an overall response rate of 27% (95% confidence interval, 17% to 41%). Median survival was 38 weeks and the survival rate at 1 year was 32%. Paclitaxel plus carboplatin, as given in this study, was found to be a moderately active regimen in patients with advanced NSCLC. This regimen warrants comparison with existing cisplatin-based regimens in a prospective randomized trial.
Cross-sectional studies suggest an association between exposure to ambient air pollution and atherosclerosis. We investigated the association between outdoor air quality and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis (common carotid artery intima-media thickness, CIMT).
We examined data from five double-blind randomized trials that assessed effects of various treatments on the change in CIMT. The trials were conducted in the Los Angeles area. Spatial models and land-use data were used to estimate the home outdoor mean concentration of particulate matter up to 2.5 micrometer in diameter (PM2.5), and to classify residence by proximity to traffic-related pollution (within 100 m of highways). PM2.5 and traffic proximity were positively associated with CIMT progression. Adjusted coefficients were larger than crude associations, not sensitive to modelling specifications, and statistically significant for highway proximity while of borderline significance for PM2.5 (P = 0.08). Annual CIMT progression among those living within 100 m of a highway was accelerated (5.5 micrometers/yr [95%CI: 0.13-10.79; p = 0.04]) or more than twice the population mean progression. For PM2.5, coefficients were positive as well, reaching statistical significance in the socially disadvantaged; in subjects reporting lipid lowering treatment at baseline; among participants receiving on-trial treatments; and among the pool of four out of the five trials.
Consistent with cross-sectional findings and animal studies, this is the first study to report an association between exposure to air pollution and the progression of atherosclerosis--indicated with CIMT change--in humans. Ostensibly, our results suggest that air pollution may contribute to the acceleration of cardiovascular disease development--the main causes of morbidity and mortality in many countries. However, the heterogeneity of the volunteering populations across the five trials, the limited sample size within trials and other relevant subgroups, and the fact that some key findings reached statistical significance in subgroups rather than the sample precludes generalizations to the general population.
Infusion-related adverse events (IRAEs) such as nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and thrombophlebitis that are associated with amphotericin B therapy often lead clinicians to prescribe a number of adjunctive pretreatment medications in an attempt to reduce the incidence and severity of these events. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of IRAEs during the first week of systemic amphotericin B therapy and to identify pretreatment regimens that are effective in preventing these IRAEs. Three hundred ninety-seven adult inpatients receiving amphotericin B therapy were prospectively monitored, and data regarding IRAEs and pretreatment regimens were collected. Of these patients, 282 (71%) developed at least one IRAE during the first 7 days of therapy. The IRAEs most commonly reported were fever (51% of patients) and chills (28%), followed by nausea (18%), headache (9%), and thrombophlebitis (5%). The most common regimens included diphenhydramine, a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and heparin, administered alone or in combination with these or other drugs. Overall, common pretreatment regimens were similar in efficacy to no pretreatment in the prevention of IRAEs. Thus empirical premedication for IRAEs associated with amphotericin B cannot be routinely advocated; instead, patients should be treated when symptoms first arise and then premedicated for subsequent amphotericin B infusions.
Forty-nine patients with non-small cell lung cancer were treated in a study designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose of outpatient paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ), given by 3-hour infusion, combined with a fixed dose of carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] = 6, Calvert method). The study population included 31 men and 18 women with previously untreated, unresectable stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer. Patients had a median age of 62 years (age range, 46 to 81 years) and a median Southwest Oncology Group performance status of 1 (range, 0 to 2). With six to 10 patients treated at each dose level, paclitaxel was given at a starting dose of 150 mg/m2, and doses were escalated by 25-mg/m2 increments. The carboplatin dose was fixed at an AUC of 6. Paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 was established as the maximum tolerated dose of this combination, and severe (grade 3) sensory neuropathy was defined as the dose-limiting toxicity. Objective responses were documented in 26 of 42 patients with objectively measurable disease, for an overall response rate of 62%. Although these data are preliminary, this regimen appears to be efficacious and cost-effective, and warrants further study. Paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 combined with carboplatin (AUC = 6) every 3 weeks is recommended for follow-up phase II and III clinical trials.
Few cytotoxic agents tested in adequate phase II trials involving patients with non-small cell lung cancer have produced single-agent response rates greater than 15%. Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) is one of them, with reported response rates ranging from 21% to 36%. Platinum-based regimens have been key to the development of the most effective combination therapies for NSCLC. We are currently investigating the efficacy and toxicity of combining paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) given by 3-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin (75 mg/m2) via 1-hour infusion, on a 21-day schedule for the treatment of 75 chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB (17.3%) or stage IV (82.6%) non-small cell lung cancer. Patient characteristics include a median age of 58 years (age range, 28 to 75 years) and a median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2; 19 patients (25.3%) are women and 56 (74.7%) are men. All patients received standard prophylactic premedication as well as adequate hydration. To date, 75 subjects and 328 courses are evaluable for toxicity. Hematologic toxicities have been moderate; grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 37% of cycles (50% of patients), and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in only 2% of cycles (2% of patients). Other notable toxicities were World Health Organization grade 2 or 3 alopecia and nausea/vomiting. Grade 1 or 2 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 26% and grade 3 or 4 in only 1% of all courses. Of 67 patients evaluable for response, complete remission was noted in three (5%) patients, partial remission in 25 (37%) patients, stable disease in 22 (33%) patients, and progressive disease in 17 (25%) patients. These results suggest that combination paclitaxel/cisplatin is active and well tolerated in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
A 28-year-old patient is described who presented with progressive dyspnoea and jaundice due to interstitial pneumonia and hepatitis. The most likely cause is a drug-related reaction to minocycline. We discuss the different kinds of drug-related reactions that are most likely involved.
Fenvalerate, a pyrethroid insecticide used worldwide, has been shown to have a potentially adverse effect on male reproduction. Our earlier study showed that maternal fenvalerate exposure during lactation impaired testicular development in male offspring. In this study, we investigated the effects of pubertal and early adult exposure to fenvalerate on steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis in mice. Male mice were administered fenvalerate (60 mg/kg) by gavage daily from postnatal day 35 (PND35) to PND63. Results showed that sperm count was significantly decreased in fenvalerate-treated mice. In addition, fenvalerate markedly decreased the layers of spermatogenic cells, disturbed the array of spermatogenic cells and increased the number of apoptotic cells in testes. The adverse effects of fenvalerate on male reproduction seemed to be associated with a decrease in serum and testicular testosterone (T). Although pubertal and early adult exposure to fenvalerate had little effect on the number of Leydig cells in testes, mRNA and protein levels of testicular T biosynthetic enzymes including P450(17alpha) and P450scc were significantly downregulated in fenvalerate-treated mice. In conclusion, pubertal and early adult fenvalerate exposure induces a deleterious effect on steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis in adulthood. The decreased testicular T synthesis partially contributes to fenvalerate-induced impairment on spermatogenesis.
Insulin has been shown to increase sympathetic nerve activity. Because evidence shows that insulin acts within the central nervous system, we hypothesized that lesions of the anteroventral third ventricle region, an area rich in insulin receptors, would abolish sympathetic responses to hyperinsulinemia. We measured mean arterial pressure and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity in fasted, anesthetized sham-lesioned (n = 8) and lesioned (n = 8) rats before and after intravenous insulin infusion at 0.13 U/h during euglycemic clamp. Additional sham-lesioned (n = 10) and lesioned (n = 5) rats received vehicle infusion. Insulin-infused sham-lesioned rats had substantially greater increases in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity (+83 +/- 18%) than vehicle-infused sham-lesioned rats (+27 +/- 4%). Most importantly, insulin-infused lesioned rats had increases in sympathetic activity (+32 +/- 11%) that were no greater than lesioned rats receiving vehicle (+23 +/- 16%). Blood pressure was not altered by insulin or vehicle. To test the possibility that lesions of the anteroventral third ventricle region nonspecifically suppress sympathetic excitatory responses, we evaluated reflex increases in lumbar sympathetic activity to nitroglycerin in sham-lesioned (n = 5) and lesioned (n = 8) rats. Rats with lesions and sham lesions showed comparable increases in lumbar nerve activity during nitroglycerin-induced hypotension. In summary, increases in sympathetic nerve activity to intravenous insulin infusion are abolished by anteroventral third ventricle lesions. These data indicate that the integrity of this brain region is necessary for activation of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity by systemic administration of insulin.
During previous phase I experience of weekly paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) used as a radiation sensitizer, decreased hematologic toxicity was noted. Therefore, an extended phase I/II trial of weekly paclitaxel in patients with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and activity of this alternative schedule. Twenty-six patients entered this study through six dose levels of paclitaxel (100, 125, 135, 150, 175, and 200 mg/m2/wk) administered weekly for 6 of 8 weeks. Doses were escalated if more than 80% of the intended dose was administered in the preceding cohort without evidence of grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity. All patients had a performance status of 0 to 2 and a median age of 63 years. Sites of disease included the lung, bone, liver, soft tissue, and brain. Twenty-four patients completed the first 8-week cycle and are evaluable for toxicity and response. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 200 mg/m2/wk and consisted primarily of neutropenia. Only one evaluable patient required hospitalization for febrile neutropenia. Other toxicities included rash, pulmonary infiltrate, myalgia, neuropathy, and alopecia. Nine of 24 patients (38%) demonstrated objective responses. We conclude that the maximum tolerated dose of weekly paclitaxel administered for 6 weeks in an 8-week cycle is 175 mg/m2/wk. The response rate is encouraging and this schedule merits further investigation.
Based on the activity of single-agent paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) and the significant 1-year survival rates of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with carboplatin, the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group initiated a phase II trial using both agents in patients with inoperable stage III or IV disease to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of the combination. Since July 1995, 31 patients fulfilling all eligibility criteria entered this study. All patients received paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion and carboplatin dosed to an area under the concentration-time curve of 7, every 3 weeks. No granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given. Among the 29 male and two female patients, the median age was 55 years (age range, 29 to 73 years) and the median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1. Most of the patients had stage IV adenocarcinoma (19) with low differentiation (15). The median number of chemotherapy cycles was two, with a range of one to six. Among 21 patients evaluable, seven achieved a partial response, 10 had stable disease, and four had progressive disease. It is too early to evaluate nine patients. Grade 2/3 nonhematologic toxicity included alopecia (48%), neurotoxicity (3.7%), and myalgia/arthralgia (7.4%). Grade 2/3 neutropenia occurred in 11.1% of patients, whereas grade 2 thrombocytopenia was seen in only 3.7%. One patient died following complications of severe allergic reaction. In conclusion, although this study is ongoing, combination treatment using paclitaxel and carboplatin is both effective and well tolerated in patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer.
Activation of the antiogensin II, type 1 (AT1) receptor mediates the myocardial response to numerous hypertrophic stimuli. This study tested the hypothesis that 2-tetradecylglycidic acid (TDGA), an oxirane carboxylate inhibitor of mitochondrial carnitine plamitoyltransferase-1, induces myocardial hypertrophy via the AT1 receptor system. Male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with 10 mg TDGA/kg/day for 7 days had a heart wet weight:body weight ratio of 3. 58+/-0.16 mg/g compared with a ratio of 2.79+/-0.07 for rats treated with vehicle (P<0.05). The plasma level of antiogensin II was 117. 75+/-17.39 pg/ml in rats treated with 10 mg TDGA/kg/day compared with 54.0+/-11.38 pg/ml for rats treated with vehicle (P<0.05). The plasma level of angiotensin I in these two groups of rats was not different statistically. Rats treated with TDGA and given drinking water containing 1 mg losartan/ml had a heart wet weight:body weight ratio of 2.84+/-0.05 mg/g. This value was not statistically different from the value measured in rats given drinking water containing 1 mg losartan/ml and treated with vehicle alone. No significant difference in the heart wet weight:dry weight ratio occurred among these groups of rats. Finally, treating rats with TDGA or giving rats drinking water that contained 1 mg losartan/ml altered neither their heart rate nor their mean arterial blood pressure when compared with untreated rats. This data, therefore, suggests that oxirane carboxylates induce myocardial hypertrophy by activating the AT1 receptor independent of changes in systemic hemodynamics.
This study investigates how secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure influences neonatal birth weight in Jordan, a country with high smoking prevalence. The findings revealed that as the average number of SHS exposure hours per week increased in the second trimester, the neonatal birth weight decreased while holding all covariates constant. Women who reported a higher average number of SHS exposure hours per week from work in the second trimester, home in the third trimester, and outside in the third trimester were at greater risk for having a low birth weight neonate than women who reported a lower average number of SHS exposure hours.
Acute renal failure due to intravascular hemolysis is a common clinical problem in North Indian patients. It constituted 21.5 percent of 325 patients dialyzed for acute renal failure over an 11-year period at Chandigarh. Thirty patients had developed acute intravascular hemolysis in association with erythrocyte glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6PD) deficiency, 17 due to copper sulphate intoxication and 8 due to envenomation by snakes. Less frequent causes were insect stings, incompatible blood transfusion, intake of anti-leprosy drug--dapsone in non-G-6PD-deficient patients, and mercuric chloride toxicity in two patients each; naphthalene poisoning in one; and uncertain causes in six patients. Renal histology was available in 55 patients. Acute tubular necrosis was seen in 54 and bilateral diffuse cortical necrosis in one patient. Fifty patients (71.43 percent) survived and 20(28.6 percent) diet. G-6PD erythrocyte deficiency, which is present in 4.5 percent of the North Indian population, was the most frequent cause of acute renal failure in this group.
There currently is no pharmacologic approach to the problem of anticipatory nausea and vomiting (ANV). Lorazepam (Ativan, Wyeth Laboratories, Philadelphia) is an interesting candidate drug if it could block the recall of the unpleasant events associated with chemotherapy, especially if it also has antiemetic properties. Since ANV is a conditioned (learned) response, it may well depend on a memory imprint of the stimulus. This pilot study was designed to use intravenous lorazepam given before and after cisplatin infusion in 32 patients, and to make detailed measurements of nausea, vomiting, recent memory, anxiety, and sedation as well as toxicity. Satisfactory responses occurred in about 70%, as rated separately both by investigator and patient. Forty-six percent did not even recall receiving chemotherapy, regardless of whether or not they vomited; 80% had no significant anxiety after chemotherapy. Adverse reactions included some cases of perceptual disturbance, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, hypotension, and one case of severe transient amnesia. No long-term adverse effects were noted.
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent with a wide spectrum of activity against malignant tumours. Because of its pronounced immunosuppressive effect it is also frequently used in organ transplantations and in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. The drug has toxic side effects, however, some of which are ascribed to specific metabolites. This report describes a patient who developed cyclophosphamide associated cystitis and pneumonitis while being treated for Wegener's granulomatosis. Early recognition of the condition and discontinuation of therapy is essential for a favourable outcome.
Spinal epidural lipomatosis is the excessive deposition of unencapsulated fat in the epidural space. This is a rare disorder often associated with high levels of endogenous steroids or the administration of exogenous steroids.
A 32-year-old man with congenital kyphosis treated with prednisolone daily for 5 months for interstitial lung disease developed compressive myelopathy.
Magnetic resonance imaging showed congenital kyphosis along with epidural lipomatosis compressing the cord. Cessation of steroid therapy was associated with improvement in the symptoms.
Spinal epidural lipomatosis is a rare side effect of chronic steroid therapy that may occur with relatively short-term, low-dose regimens. In patients with congenital vertebral anomalies, spinal fat deposition may worsen the neurological status in an already compromised cord. Discontinuation of steroid therapy is beneficial; some patients may require surgical intervention for decompression.
Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured during induced hypotension with increasing doses of adenosine triphosphate (1-5 mg X kg-1 X min-1 ATP) in dogs without (group I) and with (group II) intracranial hypertension. After administration of 1 mg X kg-1 X min-1 ATP, ICP increased significantly from 11 +/- 4 mm Hg to 14 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) (P less than 0.05; group I) and from 27 +/- 2 mm Hg to 38 +/- 6 mm Hg (P less than 0.05; group II), while mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased from 103 +/- 10 mm Hg to 86 +/- 6 mm Hg (P less than 0.05; group I) and from 110 +/- 11 mm Hg to 90 +/- 11 mm Hg (P less than 0.05; group II). In both groups a slow decrease of ICP after the initial increase occurred with further lowering of MAP, but ICP remained significantly above control values even with a dose of 5 mg X kg-1 X min-1 ATP (P less than 0.05). Ventricular volume-pressure response curves (VPR) before and during intravenous infusion of 3 mg X kg-1 X min-1 ATP were constructed to determine changes in intracranial compliance (ICC). In both groups I and II ATP decreased ICC. On the basis of these results it is recommended that in the presence of intracranial mass lesions ATP should not be given to induce arterial hypotension before the dura is opened.
Inhibition (quenching) of contact sensitization by cinnamic aldehyde (CA) reportedly occurs from eugenol (E) and d-limonene (d-L). Experimentally the former inhibited nonimmunologic contact urticaria (NICU) from CA in seven of eleven test subjects, which prompted a search for possible mechanisms, including chemical interaction, altered absorption, and anti-inflammatory activity, and competitive inhibition. Mixtures of CA and E and CA and d-L showed no chemical changes or intermolecular bonding. Absorption was not increased by cellophane tape stripping, and neither E nor d-L inhibited urticaria formation following stimulation of skin of five subjects with dermographism. Competitive inhibition at the receptor level may best explain the quenching phenomenon observed. Additional factors are presented that complicate the already numerous caveats in interpreting test results in NICU.
The membrane-active antifungal agent amphotericin B (AmB) is one of the few agents shown to slow the course of prion diseases in animals. Congo Red and other small molecules have been reported to directly inhibit amyloidogenesis in both prion and Alzheimer peptide model systems via specific binding. We propose that it is possible that AmB may act similarly to physically prevent conversion of the largely alpha-helical prion protein (PrP) to the pathological beta-sheet aggregate protease-resistant isoform (PrP(res)) in prion disease and by analogy prevent fibrillization in amyloid diseases. To assess whether AmB is capable of binding specifically to amyloid fibrils as does Congo Red, we have used the insulin fibril and Abeta 25-35 amyloid model fibril system. We find that AmB does bind strongly to both insulin (K(d) = 1.1 microM) and Abeta 25-35 amyloid (K(d) = 6.4 microM) fibrils but not to native insulin. Binding is characterized by a red-shifted AmB spectrum indicative of a more hydrophobic environment. Thus AmB seems to have a complementary face for amyloid fibrils but not the native protein. In addition, AmB interacts specifically with Congo Red, a known fibril-binding agent. In kinetic fibril formation studies, AmB was able to significantly kinetically delay the formation of Abeta 25-35 fibrils at pH 7.4 but not insulin fibrils at pH 2.
