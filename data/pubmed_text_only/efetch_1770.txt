Propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced hemolytic anemia is extremely rare. We reported a case of Graves' disease with these unusual clinical manifestations. A 41-year-old female presented with recurrent attacks of severe hemolytic anemia after PTU therapy. Sugar water test and erythrocytes osmotic fragility test revealed no cellular membrane defect of red blood cells. Antinuclear antibody, direct and indirect Coombs' tests were all negative and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was also within normal limits. PTU was not discontinued promptly due to unrecognizableness of such a rare case until two months later with recurrent attacks of severe hemolytic anemia. 1-131 therapy was performed on suspicion of related hemolytic anemia. Unfortunately, challenge of PTU occurred incidentally after discontinuation of PTU followed by severe hemolytic anemia. The diagnosis of PTU-induced hemolytic anemia was established thereafter. A MEDLINE search revealed only one such case reported in English literature. This is the first case report in Taiwan. It should be kept in mind that hemolytic anemia may be a rare complication of PTU therapy.
Resting, supine, and upright exercise hemodynamics were studied in 11 patients with pure or predominant mitral stenosis before and after 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin. Resting mean pulmonary wedge pressure was reduced from 27 +/- 1.6 to 21 +/- 1.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), while mean cardiac index (2.98 +/- 0.40 vs 2.68 +/- 0.30 cc/min/m2; NS) and mean heart rate (82 +/- 4.4 vs 87 +/- 6.7 bpm; NS) were unchanged after nitroglycerin. Resting mean left ventricular end-diastolic pressure dropped from 11 +/- 1.7 to 8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.02) after nitroglycerin, while stroke index (37 +/- 5.1 vs 32 +/- 3.8 mm Hg; NS) was unchanged. Left ventricular systolic pressure fell from 122 +/- 6.0 to 111 +/- 3.1 mm HG (p less than 0.001) after nitroglycerin. At peak supine exercise similar qualitative changes were observed. Mean pulmonary wedge pressure was lower after nitroglycerin (43 +/- 2.3 vs 36 +/- 2.1 mm Hg; p less than 0.02), while cardiac index (3.62 +/- 0.39 vs 3.4 +/- 0.26 cc/min/m2; NS) and heart rate (116 +/- 7.1 vs 113 +/- 4.6 bpm; NS) were not different. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (13 +/- 1.4 vs 10 +/- 1.3; NS) was slightly but not significantly reduced by nitroglycerin. Left ventricular stroke index (34 +/- 3.4 vs 31 +/- 2.2 mm Hg; NS) was unchanged by nitroglycerin. Left ventricular systolic pressure (137 +/- 7.3 vs 127 +/- 6.1 mm Hg; p less than 0.02) was reduced 10 mm Hg at peak supine exercise after nitroglycerin. During upright exercise, peak heart rate (160 +/- 8.1 vs 160 +/- 8.0 bpm; NS) and peak systolic blood pressure (117 +/- 5.7 vs 112 +/- 2.8 mm Hg; NS) were not changed with nitroglycerin. Exercise duration was improved after nitroglycerin (5.02 +/- 0.62 vs 5.66 +/- 0.65 minutes; p less than 0.02). Thus sublingual nitroglycerin lowers mean pulmonary wedge pressure to reduce pulmonary congestive symptoms, improves supine exercise hemodynamics, and may enhance treadmill exercise duration in some patients with pure or predominant mitral stenosis.
The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease events in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease is controversial.
To examine the benefits and harms of aspirin chemoprevention.
MEDLINE (1966 to May 2001).
1) Randomized trials at least 1 year in duration that examined aspirin chemoprevention in patients without previously known cardiovascular disease and 2) systematic reviews, recent trials, and observational studies that examined rates of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to aspirin use.
One reviewer read and extracted data from each included article and constructed evidence tables. A second reviewer checked the accuracy of the data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
Meta-analysis was performed, and the quantitative results of the review were then used to model the consequences of treating patients with different levels of baseline risk for coronary heart disease. Five trials examined the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events in patients with no previous cardiovascular disease. For patients similar to those enrolled in the trials, aspirin reduces the risk for the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (summary odds ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87]). Aspirin increased the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (summary odds ratio, 1.4 [CI, 0.9 to 2.0]) and major gastrointestinal bleeding (summary odds ratio, 1.7 [CI, 1.4 to 2.1]). All-cause mortality (summary odds ratio, 0.93 [CI, 0.84 to 1.02]) was not significantly affected. For 1000 patients with a 5% risk for coronary heart disease events over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 6 to 20 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. For patients with a risk of 1% over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 1 to 4 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events.
The net benefit of aspirin increases with increasing cardiovascular risk. In the decision to use aspirin chemoprevention, the patient's cardiovascular risk and relative utility for the different clinical outcomes prevented or caused by aspirin use must be considered.
The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and side effects of haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and lorazepam for the treatment of the symptoms of delirium in adult AIDS patients in a randomized, double-blind, comparison trial.
Nondelirious, medically hospitalized AIDS patients (N = 244) consented to participate in the study and were monitored prospectively for the development of delirium. Patients entered the treatment phase of the study if they met DSM-III-R criteria for delirium and scored 13 or greater on the Delirium Rating Scale. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to treatment with haloperidol (N = 11), chlorpromazine (N = 13), or lorazepam (N = 6). Efficacy and side effects associated with the treatment were measured with repeated assessments using the Delirium Rating Scale, the Mini-Mental State, and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale.
Treatment with either haloperidol or chlorpromazine in relatively low doses resulted in significant improvement in the symptoms of delirium as measured by the Delirium Rating Scale. No improvement in the symptoms of delirium was found in the lorazepam group. Cognitive function, as measured by the Mini-Mental State, improved significantly from baseline to day 2 for patients receiving chlorpromazine. Treatment with haloperidol or chlorpromazine was associated with an extremely low prevalence of extrapyramidal side effects. All patients receiving lorazepam, however, developed treatment-limiting adverse effects. Although only a small number of patients had been treated with lorazepam, the authors became sufficiently concerned with the adverse effects to terminate that arm of the protocol early.
Symptoms of delirium in medically hospitalized AIDS patients may be treated efficaciously with few side effects by using low-dose neuroleptics (haloperidol or chlorpromazine). Lorazepam alone appears to be ineffective and associated with treatment-limiting adverse effects.
Gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) are active as first-line therapy against advanced pancreatic cancer. This study aims to evaluate the activity and tolerability of this combination in patients refractory to standard gemcitabine (GEM). A total of 33 patients (median age of 57) were included with locally advanced and metastatic evaluable diseases, who had progressed during or following GEM therapy. The GEMOX regimen consisted of 1000 mg m(-2) of GEM at a 100-min infusion on day 1, followed on day 2 by 100 mg m(-2) of oxaliplatin at a 2-h infusion; a cycle that was given every 2 weeks. All patients received at least one cycle of GEMOX (median 5; range 1-29). Response by 31 evaluable patients was as follows: PR: 7/31(22.6%), s.d. > or = 8 weeks: 11/31(35.5%), s.d. < 8 weeks: 1/31(3.2%), PD: 12/31(38.7%). Median duration of response and TTP were 4.5 and 4.2 months, respectively. Median survival was 6 months (range 0.5-21). Clinical benefit response was observed in 17/31 patients (54.8%). Grade III/IV non-neurologic toxicities occurred in 12/33 patients (36.3%), and grade I, II, and III neuropathy in 17(51%), 3(9%), and 4(12%) patients, respectively. GEMOX is a well-tolerated, active regimen that may provide a benefit to patients with advanced pancreatic cancer after progression following standard gemcitabine treatment.
Appropriate use of carbamazepine for the treatment of epilepsy is based on correct identification of the patient's seizure type. Carbamazepine is effective against partial seizures and against generalized tonic clonic seizures. Therapy should begin gradually, with initial doses increased slowly over 1 or 2 weeks, as tolerated. Side effects include fatigue, dizziness, ataxia, double vision, nausea, and vomiting. Most practitioners agree that, because of carbamazepine's relatively short half-life, the total dosage should be administered in at least two divided doses. This avoids too high a peak blood level that would occur with a single dose. Carbamazepine therapy is associated with the development of two hematologic conditions. Leukopenia, which may be transient or persistent, requires careful monitoring but is not cause for immediate discontinuation of therapy. Aplastic anemia occurs rarely but is potentially fatal, and therefore diligent monitoring of hematologic function is indicated. Aplastic anemia is an idiosyncratic, non-dose-related side effect that is most likely to occur within the first 3 or 4 months of initiating therapy. Once seizures are controlled, plasma levels of carbamazepine should be measured to establish optimum levels for individual patients being treated with this drug.
Neurotoxicity associated with intravenous acyclovir therapy is well documented. We report 4 cases of acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity in dialysis patients receiving oral therapy at a reduced dose.
This prospective study quantifies the response of hemoglobin and other blood factors to Epoetin alpha (EPO) administration in the course of pre-operative chemotherapy in breast cancer. Blood count time series were analyzed in 38 primary breast cancer patients with/without EPO during the course of pre-operative chemotherapy with epirubicin and paclitaxel. EPO injections improved blood counts in 'anemic' patients (< or =12.0 g/dl) receiving chemotherapy, but had little effect when administered to patients with higher hemoglobin concentrations. On the average, without chemotherapy, hemoglobin concentrations drifted toward about 11.1 g/dl without EPO but could be maintained at near 12.0 g/dl with EPO. In conclusion, there is potential for improved anemia management using EPO during pre-operative chemotherapy, which not only benefits quality of life but could also influence long-term survival in breast cancer through improved tumor oxygenation.
To find a quick screen of potential bladder carcinogens, a genotoxicity test in Drosophila melanogaster stocks containing DNA repair mutations was evaluated. Meiosis repair deficient male Drosophila melanogaster mei-9, mei-41, and the double mutant mei-9-41 were allowed to mate with attached -x females on media containing the test agent. Genotoxic agents produce DNA damage which accumulates and can be lethal in mei males, whereas the attached -x females are able to repair the damage and survive. Thus, the sex ratio of the progeny is a measure of genotoxicity which can be correlated with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. In this study, tea, coffee, and saccharin were not genotoxic (p greater than 0.3). Dose dependent toxicity was observed in bracken fern (p less than 0.001). The known mutagen and bladder carcinogen, cyclophosphamide, was highly genotoxic (p less than .001). Drosophila genotoxicity not only permits rapid screening of mutagens, but may also have advantages over other systems in the screening of potential bladder carcinogens.
The free amino acid content in the cerebral cortex of rats administered caffeine orally, and with automutilation behavior similar to that observed in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, have been measured. Amino acids significantly elevated were taurine, histidine and aspartic acid, whereas tyrosine showed a significant reduction. There was no change in the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamic acid. It has been conjectured that changes in amino acids levels in the cortex might be responsible for the pharmacological action of caffeine and for the progressive behavior abnormalities observed in these rats. Interestingly these results are similar to these found recently in experimental uremia.
We report a case of poisoning resulting from the use of Chinese proprietary medicines (CPM) containing anticonvulsants phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. The manufacturer's information leaflets did not mention any of these prescription drugs. As a consequence, the patient was admitted comatose due to severe phenytoin poisoning. We are not aware of any reported case of severe poisoning due to CPM adulterated with anticonvulsants and this is possibly the first case.
Thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone and 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), are two peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma ligands. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rosiglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 on the lung injury caused by bleomycin administration. Mice subjected to intratracheal administration of bleomycin developed significant lung injury. An increase in immunoreactivity to nitrotyrosine, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase as well as a significant loss of body weight and mortality was observed in the lung of bleomycin-treated mice. Administration of the two PPAR-gamma agonists rosiglitazone (10 mg x kg(-1) i.p.) and 15d-PGJ2 (30 microg x kg(-1) i.p.) significantly reduced the: 1) loss of body weight, 2) mortality rate, 3) infiltration of the lung with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (myeloperoxidase activity), 4) oedema formation, and 5) histological evidence of lung injury. Administration of rosiglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 also markedly reduced the nitrotyrosine, PARP and inducible nitric oxide synthase formation. In addition, treatment with the PPAR-gamma antagonist bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (1 mg x kg(-1) i.p. 30 min before the rosiglitazone or 15d-PGJ2) significantly antagonised the effect of the two PPAR-gamma agonists. These results demonstrate that the two peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists, rosiglitazone and 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2, significantly reduce lung injury induced by bleomycin in mice.
We investigated the pathophysiological significance of adrenomedullin (AM) in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). LVH was produced by aortic banding (AB) in rats. The left ventricular weight/body weight (LV/BW) ratio, ventricular AM peptide and mRNA levels, and hemodynamics were measured at 1, 3, 7, and 21 days after the operation. Both LV/BW ratio and ventricular AM levels showed a significant increase from 1 day after the operation in the AB rats versus the sham-operated rats. Both increased in a time-dependent manner. The ventricular AM levels correlated with the LV/BW ratio (r=0.76, P<0.01). The AM mRNA levels were highly expressed at 1 day after the operation in the AB rats but showed no difference from 3 to 21 days after the operation between the AB and sham groups. The plasma AM levels showed a peak at 1 day after the operation in both groups. Then, we treated AB rats with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (quinapril) in 2 doses (1 and 10 mg. kg-1. d-1) for 21 days. The quinapril treatment attenuated similarly both the LV/BW ratio and the ventricular AM levels. We also assessed the effects of AM and hydralazine administration for 7 days on the LV/BW ratio and hemodynamics of AB rats. Both AM and hydralazine administration reduced the blood pressure by approximately 10% compared with the nontreated AB rats, but a reduction of the LV/BW ratio was observed only in the AM-treated group (P<0.05). These results suggest that ventricular AM levels are elevated by chronic pressure overload in a time-dependent manner concomitant with the extent of LVH and that AM may play a pathophysiological role in the development of LVH in chronic pressure overload.
Amiodarone is a drug broadly used on cardiac arrhythmias despite its multiple side-effects. We present the case of an adult male with symptomatic ventricular tachycardia, receiving longterm amiodarone, who showed increased CK serum levels, sensorimotor neuropathy and secondary myopathy. Quadriceps biopsy showed atrophic changes and sural nerve intralysosomal deposits with intense axonal degeneration. The case illustrates the need to investigate and monitor peripheral neuropathy and muscular atrophy in chronic amiodarone use.
Pain on injection is a recognized adverse effect of propofol, an agent used to induce general anesthesia in surgical patients. Pretreatment with fentanyl has been reported to be effective in reducing propofol-induced pain.
The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intravenous pretreatment with fentanyl 50 microg, fentanyl 100 microg, and lidocaine 40 mg, preceded by venous occlusion, for reducing pain on injection of propofol in adult Japanese surgical patients.
This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Adult Japanese surgical patients were randomized to 1 of 4 groups to receive intravenous fentanyl 50 microg, fentanyl 100 microg, lidocaine 40 mg, or placebo (0.9% isotonic saline). The drug administration was preceded by manual venous occlusion with a rubber tourniquet for 1 minute, followed by administering propofol 0.5 mg/kg injected into the largest dorsal vein of the hand through a 20-gauge intravenous cannula at the rate of 10 mg/sec. Pain on injection of propofol was assessed by an investigator who was blinded to group assignment. Patients were interviewed to assess pain intensity on injection using a 4-point verbal rating scale (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe). Incidence and severity of pain were determined in each of the 4 study groups. Adverse events related to the study drug were recorded before the induction of anesthesia and after surgery. Patients were monitored for adverse events for 24 hours following surgery.
A total of 120 patients (70 men and 50 women; mean [SD] age, 44 [11] years; height, 160 [7] cm; weight, 56 [10] kg) completed the study. Each group comprised 30 patients. No significant between-group differences in demographic characteristics were found. The overall incidence of propofol-induced pain was 77% (23/30 patients) with fentanyl 50 microg (P = NS), 37% (11/30 patients) with fentanyl 100 microg (P = 0.001), and 33% (10/30 patients) with lidocaine 40 mg (P = 0.001) compared with 83% (25/30 patients) with placebo. The median pain score was lower in patients who received fentanyl 50 microg (1; P = NS), fentanyl 100 microg (0; P = 0.001), or lidocaine 40 mg (0; P = 0.001) than in those who received placebo (2). The incidence and severity of pain were significantly different between the fentanyl 50-microg and 100-microg groups (incidence, P = 0.002; severity, P = 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence and severity of such pain between the fentanyl 100-microg and lidocaine 40-mg groups. Both study drugs were well tolerated.
Preceded by venous occlusion for 1 minute, fentanyl 100 microg was not significantly different from lidocaine 40 mg in reducing pain during injection of propofol in these adult Japanese surgical patients. Fentanyl 50 microg was ineffective in reducing such pain compared with placebo.
Janus kinase (JAK) pathways are key mediators in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. Psoriasis treatment has evolved with the advent of targeted therapies, which inhibit specific components of the psoriasis proinflammatory cascade. JAK inhibitors have been studied in early phase trials for psoriasis patients, and the data are promising for these agents as potential treatment options. Tofacitinib, an oral or topically administered JAK1 and JAK3 inhibitor, and ruxolitinib, a topical JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, have been most extensively studied in psoriasis, and both improved clinical symptoms of psoriasis. Additional JAK1 or JAK3 inhibitors are being studied in clinical trials. In phase III trials for rheumatoid arthritis, tofacitinib was efficacious in patients with inadequate responses to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, methotrexate monotherapy, or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The results of phase III trials are pending for these therapies in psoriasis, and these agents may represent important alternatives for patients with inadequate responses to currently available agents. Further investigations with long-term clinical trials are necessary to verify their utility in psoriasis treatment and assess their safety in this patient population.
The antiparkinsonian effect of zonisamide (ZNS), an antiepileptic agent, has been reported. Generally, resting tremor of patients with Parkinson's disease is not the main therapeutic target in this disease. However, depending on the social situation of the patient, the amelioration of the tremor may be necessary. In this study, we examined the effect of ZNS on tremor in nine patients who desired amelioration of their tremor. Except for tremor, they seemed to be under optimal therapeutic condition based on their daily activities. By the add-on administration of ZNS, the degree of tremor was reduced in seven out of nine patients (p < 0.0017). Although one patient felt sleepiness and two patients had a transient loss of appetite, all the patients tolerated the eight-week ZNS administration period. The final dose of ZNS was 100 mg/day in the majority of the patients. Although the mechanism of the antitremulous effect of ZNS is not yet clear, other than the enhancement of dopaminergic transmission, some specific action of the drug on tremor may exist. A more detailed random examination should be carried out.
Convulsive potency was evaluated to investigate the mechanism of neurotoxic convulsion induced by histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). Four H2 blockers, cimetidine (721-1236 nmol), ranitidine (477-954 nmol), famotidine (7.4-44 nmol), and nizatidine (226-603 nmol) were administered intracerebrally (i.c.) to mice. Dose dependency of clonic and/or tonic convulsion was observed, and the ED50 values of convulsive occurrence for cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine were 997, 662, 23.4, and 404 nmol, respectively. Intraperitoneal pretreatment of muscimol, aminooxy acetic acid, diazepam, (+/-)2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (APH), or (+)MK801 suppressed the tonic convulsion after i.c. administration of ranitidine, but had no effect on clonic convulsion. Furthermore, the convulsive threshold concentration in the brain determined by constant rate infusion of ranitidine was not affected by the pretreatment of muscimol, diazepam, APH, and MK801. Ed50 values for convulsive occurrence after i.c. administration of four H2 blockers correlated well with the EC50 values for gastric acid secretion inhibition. The convulsive threshold concentrations of cimetidine and ranitidine in the brain were 11 and 2.5 microM, respectively, which were similar to the dissociation constants determined from the inhibition of gastric acid output in mice. From these results, tonic convulsion induced by H2 blockers can be suppressed by GABAergic or glutamatergic anticonvulsants, while clonic convulsion induced by H2 blockers may be associated with the blockade of H2 receptor in the brain and not be directly associated with the GABA and glutamate-mediated neurotransmission.
A tropane ester, three tropane ethers, atropine and mecamylamine were compared in mice for their anti-muscarinic and anti-nicotinic activity against arecoline-induced tremor and nicotine-induced convulsions, respectively. Their receptor-binding characteristics were studied in neuronal membranes prepared from rat cerebral cortex. The results showed that the tropane ester, 2 alpha R-tropanyl benzylate, was more potent than atropine in its anti-muscarinic activity, but the anti-muscarinic activity of the tropane ethers, 2 alpha-(2',2'-diphenyl-2'-hydroxy-ethoxy)tropane (alpha-DPT) and its two isomers (1R,2 alpha R- and 1S,2 alpha S-) were less potent than that of atropine. In contrast with their anti-muscarinic potency, 2 alpha R-tropanyl benzylate and the three tropane ethers were equipotent in their anti-nicotinic activities. The order of potencies of these compounds to displace the binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate to brain membranes was similar to that of their anti-muscarinic potencies. The binding of [3H]nicotine to nicotinic receptors from brain was not inhibited by these compounds. Analyses of structure-activity relationships of these compounds suggested that it is the ester groups that determine the anti-muscarinic potencies of 2 alpha R-tropanyl benzylate; their anti-nicotinic activities were independent of the structural changes and of the anti-muscarinic activities of these compounds.
Eighty hospital patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis associated with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa were treated with ciprofloxacin. The patients were divided into four groups of 20 patients each and administered either 500 mg, 750 mg (two different batches of tablets) or 1000 mg twice daily for ten days. Most of the patients with Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis infections were treated successfully but the results in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were less satisfactory. Although the ciprofloxacin MICs for the latter organisms were relatively low, mean serum and sputum concentrations measured on the first day of treatment did not exceed 2-3 mg/l and 1-2.3 mg/l respectively. The overall clinical results for all dosage regimes were only fair, mainly due to failure to eradicate Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Adverse effects (nausea, stomach pain or hallucinations) were seen in eight patients, causing treatment to be discontinued in five. It is concluded that ciprofloxacin is only of limited use in the treatment of respiratory tract infections unless Streptococcus pneumoniae is absent.
A case of acute neurological toxicity was observed in a patient with a retroperitoneal fibromyxosarcoma treated with DTIC (NSC-45382), Adriamycin and Vincristine. The neurological symptoms started one hour after drug administration and rapidly declined with symptomatic therapy: no EEG and scintigraphic changes were detectable. The case is discussed in relation to central nervous system complications reported by other authors, following administration of DTIC and Adriamycin.
to investigate endogenous pulmonary nitric oxide metabolism following infrarenal aortic cross-clamp-induced ischaemia-reperfusion injury.
groups of male Wistar rats (n=6) were subjected to 60 minutes of infrarenal aortic cross-clamping under general anaesthesia. Rats were culled after 0, 60 and 120 minutes> reperfusion, following release of the aortic clamp. A sham-operated control group was also studied. Acute lung injury (ALI) was quantified by measuring the protein concentration in lung bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Pulmonary myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) was measured as an index of neutrophil infiltration and degranulation in the lung. Plasma tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was measured as an index of the pro-inflammatory cytokine response and pulmonary nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was determined by measuring conversion of(3)H L-arginine to(3)H L-citrulline in tissue homogenates.
these data show significant ALI with increased pulmonary microvascular permeability and MPO activity in animals subject to 60 minutes> ischaemia and 60 minutes or 120 minutes of reperfusion compared to control animals (p<0.01). Plasma TNF-alpha levels were significantly increased following 60 minutes of ischaemia compared to controls (p<0.01) and remained significantly increased in animals subject to reperfusion (p<0.01). Pulmonary NOS activity was significantly increased in animals subject to reperfusion (p<0.01).
the reperfusion phase of infrarenal aortic cross-clamping provokes a significant increase in pulmonary NOS metabolism. The increase in plasma TNF-alpha and MPO activity suggests that this response may be secondary to inducible NOS expression. Manipulation of this response may benefit patients at risk of acute injury following infrarenal aortic reconstruction.
Humans vary in oral pain tolerance. Our earlier studies noted that the responses of subjects show 1 of 3 qualitative response patterns to a single oral capsaicin concentration, which we termed a tonic pattern (level detection response), a phasic pattern (change detection response), and an integrator pattern (cumulative irritation) response. These patterns were modeled quantitatively as the sum of 3 underlying processes. Two time-varying capsaicin stimulus profiles were designed from the quantitative model. In the ascending step paradigm, 30 ppm capsaicin was presented to 42 subjects for 15 minutes, followed immediately and without explanation by 300 ppm capsaicin for 25 minutes. In the descending step paradigm, 300 ppm capsaicin was presented to 36 other subjects for 24 minutes, followed by 10 ppm for 22 minutes. Subjective burn was rated at 1 minute and then at 3-minute intervals throughout the presentation. Fuzzy cluster analysis identified 3 distinct response phenotypes in each paradigm, corresponding to level detection, change detection, and cumulative irritation response patterns identified previously. Discriminant functions permitted classification of these phenotypes from the response patterns. Thus, these paradigms provide the first quantitative phenotypic description of distinct oral pain responses to a common irritant, capsaicin.
This study examined the time-dependent behavior of pain produced by oral application of capsaicin. Three distinct temporal response phenotypes were identified objectively: level detection, change detection, and cumulative irritation detection. These time-dependent analyses provide a new dimension to understanding individual differences in pain sensation in clinical settings.
Among protease inhibitors, atazanavir has not been associated with urolithiasis in clinical studies. We describe 11 cases of atazanavir-associated urolithiasis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Patients with low water intake, high urinary pH, and a prior history of urinary stones may have a higher risk of atazanavir-associated urine crystallization.
Twins and a singleton were born at 30 weeks' gestation although naproxen (d-2 (6'methoxy-2-naphthyl) propionic acid) had been given to the mothers in an attempt to delay parturition. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis was shown by very low plasma concentrations of prostaglandin E and the ductus arteriosus remained closed despite signs of pulmonary hypertension with severe hypoxaemia. Abnormalities in blood clotting, renal function, and bilirubin metabolism were also found and one infant died. Further studies of the benefits and risks of the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis are required before this treatment of preterm labour is accepted.
