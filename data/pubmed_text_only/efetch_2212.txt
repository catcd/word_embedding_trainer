Acute interstitial nephritis is a disease characterized by renal inflammation and is thought to be secondary to a hypersensitivity reaction. Although the causes of acute interstitial nephritis are numerous, adverse reactions to many common drugs, particularly antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, are important etiological factors. Acute interstitial nephritis has many clinical manifestations, most notably fever and rash. Flank pain is an uncommon presentation. A case of acute, severe, low-back pain and rash in a healthy woman found to be secondary to acute interstitial nephritis is reported. The etiology of acute interstitial nephritis in this patient's case is suspected to be ranitidine (Zantac; Glaxo Pharmaceuticals, Research Triangle Park, NC), which has not been previously associated with this syndrome.
Sympathomimetic use results in a triad of hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and elevated white blood cell count. Transient hypokalemia results from activation of the Na+/K+ pump and transport of potassium intracellularly. Increased serum glucose and insulin may also contribute to the intracellular shift of potassium after sympathomimetic use. Four cases of accidental pediatric albuterol ingestion with significant hypokalemia are reported. Four children between 1 and 6 years of age presented to the emergency department within 5 hours of ingesting 3.0, 1.1, 3.7, and 1.7 mg/kg albuterol, respectively. All four presented alert and oriented in no apparent distress. The most common findings were vomiting, sinus tachycardia, and hypokalemia (2.3, 2.5, 2.8, and 2.5 mmol/L, respectively). Each child received a single dose of activated charcoal and intravenous potassium replacement. All patients recovered uneventfully within 12 to 24 hours with supportive care only. These cases demonstrated that significant depressions in serum potassium can occur after pediatric albuterol overdose. Although transient, the dose-response relationship and duration of effect is unknown. Although significant hypokalemia can occur after ingestion of oral sympathomimetics, replacement should be managed on an individual basis until further studies are completed.
The fetal valproate syndrome (FVS) is characterized by distinctive facial appearance, major and minor malformations, and developmental delay. Generally, only a small proportion of prenatally exposed children are affected. The authors describe three families in whom the occurrence of FVS in all the siblings strongly suggests hereditary susceptibility to valproic acid-induced adverse outcome. The risk for recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy may be high and should be taken into account in the counseling of parents and in considering drug treatment.
Case reports concerning irreversible renal failure caused by 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) have been published. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of long-term use of 5-ASA on renal function in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).
This was a retrospective survey in 200 consecutive outpatients with CD. Endogenous creatinine clearance (ECC) was estimated from serum creatinine with the Cockroft and Gault formula. The first ECC was chosen close to the start of 5-ASA and the second was the most recent ECC available.
In 153 patients (59 men and 94 women), sufficient data were available for analysis. The interval between ECCs was 11 years, with a mean exposure to 5-ASA of 8.6 years. The cumulative dose of 5-ASA amounted to 9 kg. The ECC declined 0.3 +/- 5 mL/min/yr (from 100 +/- 25 to 92 +/- 28 mL/min; P < 0.01). In a multiple linear regression model, duration of the interval was a significant predictor for change in ECC (P < 0.0001), but cumulative dose of 5-ASA was not predictive (P = 0.30). No interstitial nephritis was reported, and in the 8 patients with the largest decline in ECC, comorbidity causing renal function impairment was present.
The mean decline in ECC of 0.3 mL/min/yr in patients with CD does not exceed the decline expected from physiologic aging. Furthermore, the cumulative dose of 5-ASA was not a predictor for change in renal function. However, as interstitial nephritis caused by 5-ASA may rarely occur, we still advocate measurements of serum creatinine before and during treatment.
The authors report on a one-year follow-up of 76 hyperactive boys who had participated in a comparative study of methylphenidate, imipramine, and placebo. They found that there was a higher rate of discontinuance of imipramine than of methylphenidate in this sample and that both medications decreased the boys' rate of weight gain but had no significant effect on growth in height. This findings is of concern because larger doses than were used in this study are in use elsewhere. Teachers reported that the group of boys who had discontinued either medications showed continued hyperactivity and behavior problems in the classroom at one year. The two treatment groups showed continued improvement at one year in classroom and home behavior and did not suffer significantly from each other.
Classifying neurotoxicity in relation to neuroleptic use has been a longstanding concern with clinical, research, and epidemiologic import. This study examines the clinical manifestations of neurotoxicity and current concepts regarding its classification. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Spontaneous Reporting System data base and extant literature were reviewed for lithium/neuroleptic neurotoxicity spectrum cases. Lithium-alone (LI), lithium/haloperidol (LiHal), and lithium/non-haloperidol neuroleptics (Li-NonHal) groups, each paired for recovery and sequelae, were established for 237 cases. Data on demographic factors, psychiatric diagnosis, and symptoms/signs/findings were tabulated. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) was used as a paradigm for severe neurotoxicity; the cases were evaluated by two strict, published sets of NMS diagnostic criteria and two "probable" classifications (one published and one established for study) based on these criteria. Altered consciousness was prominent in all groups. Hypertonia/rigidity was most pronounced in both LiHal groups, possibly reflecting higher relative neuroleptic dosing; Li and LINonHal recovery and sequelae pairs showed lower, similar percentages. Among other physical findings, tremor was either most common or prominent. Neither set of strict criteria diagnosed NMS in more than 30 percent of cases in any group. Expansion of classifications to include "probable" diagnoses resulted in appreciable global group percentage increases for only one set of criteria. The high percentage of study cases not meeting even "probable" NMS criteria, despite marked clinical morbidity that at times resulted in permanent sequelae, provides a cautionary note regarding the limitations of formulated diagnostic criteria. Data base caveats notwithstanding, study findings support the consideration of a spectrum approach to classifying and diagnosing psychotropic-related neurotoxicity.
Acute hyperadrenergic stressor states are accompanied by cation dyshomeostasis, together with the release of cardiac troponins predictive of necrosis. The signal-transducer-effector pathway accounting for this pathophysiological scenario remains unclear. We hypothesized that a dyshomeostasis of extra- and intracellular Ca2+ and Zn2+ occurs in rats in response to isoproterenol (Isop) including excessive intracellular Ca2+ accumulation (EICA) and mitochondrial [Ca2+]m-induced oxidative stress. Contemporaneously, the selective translocation of Ca2+ and Zn2+ to tissues contributes to their fallen plasma levels. Rats received a single subcutaneous injection of Isop (1 mg/kg body wt). Other groups of rats received pretreatment for 10 days with either carvedilol (C), a Î²-adrenergic receptor antagonist with mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter-inhibiting properties, or quercetin (Q), a flavonoid with mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant properties, before Isop. We monitored temporal responses in the following: [Ca2+] and [Zn2+] in plasma, left ventricular (LV) apex, equator and base, skeletal muscle, liver, spleen, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), indices of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, and myocardial fibrosis. We found ionized hypocalcemia and hypozincemia attributable to their tissue translocation and also a heterogeneous distribution of these cations among tissues with a preferential Ca2+ accumulation in the LV apex, muscle, and PBMC, whereas Zn2+ declined except in liver, where it increased corresponding with upregulation of metallothionein, a Zn2+-binding protein. EICA was associated with a simultaneous increase in tissue 8-isoprostane and increased [Ca2+]m accompanied by a rise in H2O2 generation, mPTP opening, and scarring, each of which were prevented by either C or Q. Thus excessive [Ca2+]m, coupled with the induction of oxidative stress and increased mPTP opening, suggests that this signal-transducer-effector pathway is responsible for Isop-induced cardiomyocyte necrosis at the LV apex.
A case of deep venous thrombosis following iopamidol venography is presented. This complication has not previously been reported.
Continuous low dose infusion of intravenous ketamine for postoperative analgesia was often associated with frightening acute psychodysleptic experiences in our patients. We hypothesized they were due to boluses of ketamine accumulated in the infusion line. We evaluated on two successive groups the impact of perfusion line modifications on psychodysleptic side effects occurrence.
We compared a reference historic group (in which ketamine line was connected to perfusion line) to a second prospective group (in which ketamine line was connected to the venous catheter via an unidirectional valve).
Psychodysleptic experiences occurrence decreased from 4 patients of 26 (15%) to 2 of 116 (2%, p = 0.01). Moreover, these experiences were no longer associated with severe anxious symptoms like near death experiences.
An unidirectional valve must be considered to limit the occurrence of low dose intravenous ketamine infusion associated psychedelic side effects, during postoperative analgesia.
Lithium salts are commonly prescribed psychiatric medications. While they are usually safely used on outpatients, lithium preparations are associated with systemic and ocular side effects with both acute and chronic use. The optometrist should be aware of the ocular side effects so as to participate in the management of these patients. Ocular side effects may be the first signs of lithium toxicity.
Current genomewide association studies account for only a small fraction of the estimated heritabilities of genetically complex neuropsychiatric disorders, indicating they are likely to result from the small effects of numerous predisposing variants, many of which have gone undetected. The statistical power to detect associations of common variants with small effects is increased by conducting joint association tests of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), an additional risk factor (F), and their interaction. F can represent an environmental exposure, another genotype or any source of genetic heterogeneity. In case and control studies, logistic regression makes joint tests straightforward. This analytic method cannot be employed directly when SNP transmission tests are used to detect associations in parent/affected child trios and multiplex families. However, the method can be implemented using the case/pseudocontrol approach. We applied this approach to analyze data from a genomewide association study of multiplex families ascertained for Autism Spectrum Disorder, where sex was used to define the F. Joint analyses revealed two associations exceeding genomewide significance. One novel gene, Ryandine Receptor 2, implicated in calcium channel defects, was identified with a joint P-value of 3.9E-11. Calcium channel defects have been connected to Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by Timothy Syndrome, which is Mendelian, and a previous targeted sex-specific association analysis of idiopathic Autism. A second gene, uridine phosphorylase 2, with a joint P-value of 2.3E-9, has been previously linked and associated with Autism in independent samples. These findings highlight two Autism candidate genes for follow-up studies.
Folic acid supplementation can prevent many cases of neural tube defects (NTDs), whereas suboptimal maternal folate status is a risk factor, suggesting that folate metabolism is a key determinant of susceptibility to NTDs. Despite extensive genetic analysis of folate cycle enzymes, and quantification of metabolites in maternal blood, neither the protective mechanism nor the relationship between maternal folate status and susceptibility are understood in most cases. In order to investigate potential abnormalities in folate metabolism in the embryo itself, we derived primary fibroblastic cell lines from foetuses affected by NTDs and subjected them to the dU suppression test, a sensitive metabolic test of folate metabolism. Significantly, a subset of NTD cases exhibited low scores in this test, indicative of abnormalities in folate cycling that may be causally linked to the defect. Susceptibility to NTDs may be increased by suppression of the methylation cycle, which is interlinked with the folate cycle. However, reduced efficacy in the dU suppression test was not associated with altered abundance of the methylation cycle intermediates, s-adenosylmethionine and s-adenosylhomocysteine, suggesting that a methylation cycle defect is unlikely to be responsible for the observed abnormality of folate metabolism. Genotyping of samples for known polymorphisms in genes encoding folate-associated enzymes did not reveal any correlation between specific genotypes and the observed abnormalities in folate metabolism. These data suggest that as yet unrecognized genetic variants result in embryonic abnormalities of folate cycling that may be causally related to NTDs.
To determine the efficacy and safety of quinine in treating nocturnal muscle cramps we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre trial in 17 general practice centres in Germany. Ninety-eight patients aged 18-70 years with more than six muscle cramps in two weeks were enrolled. A two-week run-in period without treatment was followed by two weeks of treatment with 400 mg quinine or placebo per day and a wash-out period of two weeks without treatment. The primary outcome measure was the reduction in the number of muscle cramps between the run-in and treatment periods. The intensity of cramps, number of nights with cramps, sleep disturbance and intensity of pain were recorded as secondary outcome measures. At baseline the median number of cramps was 12 in two weeks in both groups. The median reduction between the run-in and therapy phases was eight (95% CI 7-10) versus six (95% CI 3-7) muscle cramps during quinine and placebo treatment; 36 (80%) participants in the quinine group and 26 (53%) in the placebo group had a reduction of at least 50% in the number of muscle cramps. Frequency, intensity and pain at night showed a statistically significant difference in favour of quinine. The improvement was more evident according to physician assessment than patient assessment; this is corroborated by the high placebo response rate. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to side-effects. Short term treatment with 400 mg quinine per day can effectively prevent nocturnal leg cramps in adults without relevant side-effects.
It is known that an overdose of digoxin causes visual disturbance, but the effect on the senses of smell and taste is not known. A case of olfactory and gustatory disturbance caused by digitalism is reported. In a 62-year-old male patient suffering from chronic digitalism, the serum digoxin level rose to 6.0 ng/ml. The patient was diagnosed not only with visual disturbance but also hyposmia and hypogeusia. The patient recovered from visual and chemosensory disturbances after the serum digoxin concentration returned to normal. Because the similarity of intracellular signal transduction between photoreceptor cells and olfactory and/or taste receptor cells is known, it is suspected that the influence of digoxin to chemosensory organs was caused by intermediation of sodium-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (Na-K-ATPase) of the chemosensory receptor cells.
The prolactin (PRL) responses to oral d-fenfluramine (30 mg) and placebo were assessed in 13 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and in matched healthy subjects. After the neuroendocrine test, all patients were treated with fluvoxamine maleate (150-300 mg/day). At the end of the 10th week of treatment, 10 patients underwent again the neuroendocrine assessment. In drug-free patients, the PRL response to d-fenfluramine was significantly lower than in the comparison group. After 10-week fluvoxamine treatment, the PRL response to the serotonergic agent normalized. These findings suggest that, at least at the neuroendocrine level, central serotonergic responsivity is reduced in drug-free OCD patients, and that long-term fluvoxamine administration is associated with its normalization.
Electroneuromyographic studies have been reported as abnormal in only 9 of 23 cases of penicillamine-associated myasthenia gravis (MG). We report a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who developed clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of myasthenia 7 months after beginning penicillamine therapy. Six months after discontinuing penicillamine, it was possible to discontinue anticholinesterase medications. With clinical improvement, electrodiagnostic studies (including single-fiber electrmyography) improved, serum antibody titers to human muscle acetylcholine receptor fell, and lymphocytes became more responsive to the nonspecific mitogen phytohemagglutinin. Evidence suggests that penicillamine-associated myasthenia is a distinct syndrome rather than the chance occurrence of two diseases. This syndrome is clinically and electrophysiologically distinguishable from idiopathic myasthenia only by the high remission rate after penicillamine is discontinued.
The association between in utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure and the development of clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix has been well described. However, non-clear-cell mucin-secreting adenocarcinoma in women with DES exposure has not been previously reported. We present two cases of non-clear-cell mucinous adenocarcinoma in women having a history of in utero DES exposure. These cancers were found in older women and were more advanced than the clear-cell adenocarcinoma associated with DES. Histologic features of these tumors were notable for atypical, irregular glands lined by endocervical, intestinal, and endometrioid epithelium. The development of non-clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina in these patients may be associated with DES exposure in utero. Long-term surveillance of DES-exposed women may be warranted.
Several antitumor agents have been evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing the implantation and progressive growth of transitional cell carcinoma in an animal model. This system allows the evaluation of both the topical cytotoxic action as well as the systemic toxicity of the drugs given intravesically. Systemic cyclophosphamide and intravesical epipodophyllotoxin significantly reduced the incidence of tumor cell implantation.
Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations have been implicated in familial and sporadic gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. APC mutations are associated with autosomal dominant inheritance of disease in humans. Similarly, mice that contain a single mutant APC gene encoding a protein truncated at residue 716 (Apc(Î716)) develop multiple polyps throughout the GI tract as early as 4 weeks after birth. Inactivation of another tumor suppressor gene, Hypermethylated in Cancer 1 (HIC1), often occurs in human colon cancers, among others, via CpG island hypermethylation. Homozygous deletion of Hic1 in mice results in major developmental defects and embryonic lethality. Hic1 heterozygotes have previously been shown to develop tumors of a variety of tissue types. We now report that loss of a single Hic1 allele can promote crypt hyperplasia and neoplasia of the GI tract, and Hic1(+/-), Apc(+/Î716) double heterozygotes (DH) develop increased numbers of polyps throughout the GI tract at 60 days. Hic1 expression is absent in polyps from DH mice, with concomitant increased expression of two transcriptional repression targets of Hic1, Sirt1 and Sox9. Together, our data suggest that loss of a gene frequently silenced via epigenetic mechanisms, Hic1, can cooperate with loss of a gene mutated in GI cancer, Apc, to promote tumorigenesis in an in vivo model of multiple intestinal neoplasia.
A 32-year-old female with a relapsing minimal-change nephrotic syndrome developed a massive pulmonary embolism during the treatment of prednisolone and diuretics. The use of diuretics in addition to a hypercoagulable state associated with nephrotic syndrome per se and corticosteroid was considered to be a direct causative factor for the event. The careful use of diuretics and a consideration of additional anticoagulant therapy are emphasized.
The authors describe the development of bladder paralysis in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing maintenance chemotherapy. Immediately before the adverse clinical event, the child had received vincristine intravenously and triple therapy with hydrocortisone, cytosine arabinoside, and methotrexate intrathecally and had begun a 5-day pulse of prednisolone. The authors conclude that the ensuing reversible bladder paralysis was related to the vincristine. The clinical event resolved, and vincristine was deleted from the child's subsequent therapy until full recovery was achieved. The authors advise recognition of this problem and discontinuation of the vincristine if transient bladder paralysis develops until symptoms completely disappear.
The present study characterized involuntary movements associated with levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in patients with Parkinson's disease. We used amplitude, proportional energy, frequency dispersion and sample entropy to determine whether LID movement patterns are truly random, as clinical description seems to suggest, or possess some underlying pattern that is not visible to the naked eye. LID was captured using a magnetic tracker system, which provided 3D rendering of whole-body LID. Patients were instructed to maintain a standing position, with arms extended in front of them. We compared the measurements of the dyskinetic PD group (DPD) with 10 patients without dyskinesias (NDPD) and 10 control subjects. In comparison to the other two groups, movement patterns from the DPD group had significantly higher amplitude, confirming the presence of dyskinesias. In addition, higher frequency components in the power spectrum of velocity were detected, suggestive of higher velocity in LID movement. Furthermore, there was a concentration in narrow frequency bands, which suggested stable oscillatory activity. Finally, sample entropy revealed more regularity in the DPD group. Although not statistically significant, we found that the amplitude from the NDPD group had a tendency to be smaller than those of controls. As well, the spectra were often more dispersed for the NDPD group. In conclusion, the present results suggest that LID cannot be considered as purely random movement since they possess some deterministic pattern of motion. This may provide a way for patients to adapt to these involuntary movements while performing voluntary motor acts.
To determine the incidence of intravenous site reactions to phenytoin and valproate in a large population of patients with neurotrauma.
Retrospective chart review of two double-blind, randomized clinical trials evaluating the use of antiepileptic drugs to prevent posttraumatic seizures in patients with neurotrauma: phenytoin versus placebo (n = 390), and valproate versus phenytoin with placebo (n = 385). Information collected from the charts included the number, type, and location of intravenous lines and intravenous site events.
Tertiary care trauma and university teaching hospital.
Intravenous site reactions occurred in 18% and 25% of patients receiving valproate or phenytoin, respectively, with the majority of events (70%) occurring in the first intravenous site. Patients received the neurosurgery study drug (NSSD) by either central or peripheral lines; all intravenous site reactions occurred in peripheral administration sites. When patients who received the drug by central line during the course of therapy were excluded, the estimated incidence of site reactions was 21% and 30% for valproate and phenytoin, respectively (p = 0.056). The time to the first event was shorter with phenytoin compared with valproate (2.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 3.0 +/- 1.9 d; p = 0.009). Fewer adverse events were noted with phenytoin in the phenytoin-without-valproate study than in the phenytoin-with-valproate study, with 4.3% and 8.2% of intravenous site events recorded in patients receiving placebo or phenytoin, respectively. There was no significant difference in the number of intravenous lines per patient used during NSSD drug infusion for phenytoin versus placebo or phenytoin versus valproate.
Both intravenous phenytoin and valproate resulted in intravenous site reactions, with the loading doses responsible for the majority of the events.
Massive intestinal infarction due to occlusion of the celiac, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries occurred in two young women, one of who subsequently died. Both were smokers. They had ingested oral contraceptives for 5 and 8 years, respectively, but this therapy could not be proven to be a causative factor in their ischemic bowel disease; although such an association is uncommon, it should be considered in young women with abdominal pain.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the influence of crack cocaine use on the outcomes of HIV infection. The use of crack cocaine was associated with an increased incidence of AIDS: 27.8 per 100 person-years versus 6.6 per 100 person-years for nonusers, adjusted hazard ratio = 3.8 (1.9-7.5), P < 0.001. More specifically, crack users had a greater incidence of disseminated histoplasmosis, pneumocystosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, oesophageal candidiasis, cerebral toxoplasmosis, salmonellosis, and genital herpes. The care of HIV-infected crack users is particularly challenging and requires additional efforts to reduce the high morbidity of these patients.
In a double blind, placebo-controlled trial, we have assessed the effects of pre-operative anxiolysis on postoperative pain scores in 112 ASA I-II women, aged 18-65 years, scheduled to undergo total abdominal hysterectomy. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either oral diazepam 10 mg (n=56) or placebo (n=56) pre-operatively. Postoperative anxiety, pain scores, analgesic consumption, and sedation were evaluated at several time points during the first 24 h following surgery. Postoperative pain scores were found to be significantly higher in the diazepam group. Trait and state anxiety showed a significant effect on pain scores, independent of the treatment group. No difference was found between the groups in morphine consumption, but there was a significant reduction in morphine consumption with time.
