This paper introduces one of our projects performed at Hokkaido University. During the course of pharmacokinetic studies of SM-12502, which was under development as an anti-platelet-activating factor agent, we found three individuals who showed a slow metabolic phenotype in its pharmacokinetics. Analyzing the genes for CYP2A6 from the three, we discovered that they had the whole CYP2A6 gene deletion (CYP2A6*4C). Genetically engineered Salmonella YG7108 cells expressing human P450 were established to compare the mutagen-producing capacity of the P450 enzymes for various N-nitrosamines. We found that CYP2A6 was involved in the metabolic activation of N-nitrosamines with relatively bulky alkyl chains such as a tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), which has been known to cause lung tumors in rodents. Thus, to examine the hypothesis that individuals possessing the CYP2A6*4C have a reduced risk of cancer due to the lack of the metabolic activation of certain carcinogens in tobacco smoke, a case-control study was performed. The results clearly indicated a significant association between the CYP2A6 genotype and lung cancer risk in smokers. In contrast, there was no significant relationship between them in nonsmokers. In addition, our results showed that the reduced risk of cancer was caused by the reduced activity of CYP2A6. Thus it was expected that the inhibition of the enzyme would result in a reduced cancer risk caused by smoking. The results of experiments using mice which were treated with NNK, a carcinogenic nitrosamine contained in tobacco smoke, together with 8-methoxypsolaren, a strong inhibitor of CYP2A6, indicated that the inhibition of CYP2A6 completely abolished the occurrence of adenoma.
Measurement of delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase has been performed in bone marrow of 24 normal subjects and 20 patients with sideroblastic anaemia (five congenital, two pyridoxine-responsive, 12 primary acquired and one secondary form due to isoniazid therapy). ALA-synthetase activity without added pyridoxal-phosphate in vitro was decreased in four of the congenital cases, and in all 12 primary acquired cases. In two of these 16 cases with low ALA-synthetase activity and in a case with sideroblastic change secondary to isoniazid therapy, the enzyme activity was corrected to normal by pyridoxal-phosphate in vitro. ALA-synthetase activity was normal in both cases of pyridoxine-responsive anaemia while they were receiving pyridoxine therapy but in one of these cases, studied at repeated intervals after withdrawal of pyridoxine therapy, the bone marrow ALA-synthetase activity fell to very low levels unless pyridoxal-phosphate was added in vitro. In this case the Km of the enzyme for pyridoxal-phosphate was substantially greater than that of a control sample. Haem synthetase activity was reduced in the bone marrow of two of six cases of primary acquired sideroblastic anaemia and in one congenital case tested but was normal in the pyridoxine-responsive patient studied on pyridoxine therapy. Nevertheless, this patient showed reduced incorporation of 14C-labelled delta-aminolaevulinic acid into bone marrow haem. It is concluded that both congenital and primary acquired sideroblastic anaemia are a heterogenous group of disorders, with different defects in haem synthesis, reduced activity of delta-aminolaevulinic acid synthetase being common but not invariable in both types. Pyridoxine-responsive (congenital) sideroblastic anaemia may be due to the presence of an abnormal ALA-synthetase apoenzyme which requires excessive amounts of the coenzyme, pyridoxal-phosphate, to achieve normal activity; other abnormalities of haem synthesis may also be present.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was observed in children in Bakool region, Somalia, an area where VL has not been reported before. We describe the extent of the problem in this war- and famine-stricken area. A retrospective analysis was done of all cases admitted to a VL treatment centre between July 2000 and August 2001. Patients with longstanding fever, splenomegaly and a positive direct agglutination test (DAT; titre > 1:3200) were treated as suspected VL cases. A rapid epidemiological and entomological assessment was performed in the area. Species identification was attempted from blood samples by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of cysteine proteinase B genes. In 1 year, 230 serologically-positive cases were diagnosed as VL, and response to therapy was good in 91.6% of the 225 treated with sodium stibogluconate. Parasitological confirmation was attempted and obtained in 2 cases. Parasites were found to be most similar to Sudanese and Ethiopian reference strains of the Leishmania donovani complex. In a serological survey of 161 healthy displaced persons, 15% were positive by the leishmanin skin test and 3 (2%) were positive by the DAT. The sandfly captures showed Phlebotomus martini and P. vansomerenae. VL seems to be a longstanding and serious health problem in Bakool region. Food insecurity might have contributed to the emergence and detection of VL in this area.
Protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 plays an important role in the regulation of glycogen metabolism through inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 activity, and it has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we studied the mRNA expression of inhibitor-1 in hepatocellular carcinomas induced in rats by oral administration of N-nitrosomorpholine, and in a non-tumorigenic liver cell line (C1I), that stores glycogen in excess during early passages. In late passages, glycogen is gradually lost concomitant with cell transformation. Our in vitro model included a tumorigenic subline of C1I cells that was obtained by chemically-induced neoplastic transformation using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (C1Ict), and does not store glycogen, as well as Morris hepatoma 3924A (MH3924A) cells. We found that in hepatocellular carcinomas, in the late glycogen-poor passages (C1I(late)), and in the tumorigenic subline (C1Ict) of C1I cells, and in MH3924A cells the mRNA expression of inhibitor-1 is significantly increased. This increase in expression varied from 15 to 290-fold of that observed in normal liver. In contrast, in the early glycogen-storing passage of C1I cells (C1I(early)) the level of inhibitor-1 mRNA was found to be slightly less than that of normal liver. Inhibitor-1 mRNA levels correlated with the degree of differentiation of HCCs. These results indicate that the expression of inhibitor-1 mRNA is tightly linked to tumor progression and to the process of liver cell transformation in vitro and is inversely correlated with the glycogen content of the cell.
COX-2 and prostaglandins (PGs) might play important roles in epilepsy. In kainic acid-induced seizures, the brain largely increases PGD(2), first from COX-1 and later COX-2-induced PGF(2alpha). Pre-treatment with COX-2 inhibitors such as indomethacin, nimesulide, and celecoxib is known to aggravate kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure activity. However it is not known whether the proconvulsant effect of those non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is due to changes in endogenous prostaglandins (PGs), or what types of PGs are involved. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of intracisternally administered PGs on KA-induced seizures aggravated by pre- or post-treatment with COX-2 inhibitors. Systemic KA injection (10 mg/kg i.p.) in mice evoked mild seizure activity within 15 min. PGs were administrated intracisternally 20 min prior to KA administration. COX inhibitors (indomethacin, nimesulide, and ketoprofen, 10 mg/kg i.p.) were injected 1 h before or 15 min after KA. An additional COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, was administered orally. Intracisternally administered PGF(2alpha) (700 ng), but not PGD(2) (700 ng) or PGE(2) (700 ng) completely alleviated KA-induced seizures potentiated by COX-2 inhibitors, and also reduced KA-induced hippocampal neuronal death aggravated by indomethacin. PGF(2alpha) alone did not affect KA-induced seizures. However, an FP receptor antagonist, AL 8810 (10 or 50 ng) which is an 11beta-fluoro analogue of PGF(2alpha) potentiated KA-induced seizure activity dose-dependently. In summary, pre- or post-treatment with COX-2 inhibitors aggravates KA-induced seizures, which suggests to change the endogenous PGF(2alpha). Seizure-induced PGF(2alpha) might act as an endogenous anticonvulsant through FP receptors.
Ageing and neurodegenerative conditions are often associated with proteasome dysfunction, possibly mediated by zinc and/or copper ions. Studies have shown that (i) the olfactory lobe is normally enriched in carnosine and zinc, (ii) carnosine can suppress copper and zinc toxicity in olfactory neurones, (iii) olfactory dysfunction is often associated with neurodegenerative conditions and (iv) elevated levels of zinc are found in brains of Alzheimer's patients. It is suggested that nasal administration of carnosine should be explored as a possible way of suppressing zinc/copper-mediated proteasome inhibition and consequent neurodegeneration.
This patient, who had a history of osteoarthritis, had severe hepatitis 5 weeks after being started on diclofenac for increasing pain in the joints. A week before the onset of hepatitis, the patient complained of upper gastrointestinal symptoms and was treated for gastritis. Seven days later, she had full-blown, severe hepatitis. Diclofenac was immediately stopped, leading to a complete restoration of liver functions over the course of the next few months. We highlight the importance of having a high index of suspicion for hepatic side effects of diclofenac and emphasize the need for increased awareness of this rare but potentially serious problem. We also review relevant literature regarding incidence and management.
The micronucleus test was performed in male ICR Swiss mice following modification of benzene metabolism by co-administration of aniline, pyridine or naphthalene, or by prior injection of alpha-naphthoflavone. HPLC profiles of urinary metabolites were compared to the effects of these compounds on clastogenicity. Pyridine inhibited both benzene clastogenicity and its metabolism. Aniline and naphthalene increased the clastogenicity and slightly altered the metabolism of benzene. alpha-Naphthoflavone inhibited benzene clastogenicity and metabolism only at high doses. Since 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital both increase the metabolism of benzene but only 3-methylcholanthrene increases benzene clastogenicity, specific P450 isozymes may be responsible for different biological effects of benzene, and alterations in these effects might be caused by a shift from one isozyme to another.
1,4-Bis(aminocyclohexyl)methane (PACM; CAS No. 1761-71-3) is a white solid considered for use in polymeric systems. PACM is moderately toxic systemically, with the acute oral lethal dose in rats between 670 and 1000 mg kg-1. PACM is a weak dermal sensitizer in the guinea pig. Instillation of as little as 10 mg of PACM to the rabbit eye produces severe injury. This damage could be permanent and was not reduced by rinsing the eye with water. Dogs given oral doses of 50 mg PACM kg-1 5 days per week for up to 18 months showed kidney and liver damage, along with local irritation of the gastrointestinal tract. The chemical is highly irritating and contact with it should be avoided.
The nonselective muscarinic antagonist scopolamine hydrobromide (SCOP) is employed as the gold standard for inducing memory impairments in healthy humans and animals. However, its use remains controversial due to the wide spectrum of behavioral effects of this drug.
The present study investigated whether biperiden (BIP), a muscarinic m1 receptor antagonist, is to be preferred over SCOP as a pharmacological model for cholinergic memory deficits in rats. This was done by comparing the effects of SCOP and BIP using a battery of operant tasks: fixed ratio (FR5) and progressive ratio (PR10) schedules of reinforcement, an attention paradigm and delayed nonmatching to position task.
SCOP induced diffuse behavioral disruption, which included sensorimotor responding (FR5, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg), food motivation (PR10, 1 mg/kg), attention (0.3 mg/kg, independent of stimulus duration), and short-term memory (delayed nonmatching to position (DNMTP), 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, delay-dependent but also impairment at the zero second delay). BIP induced relatively more selective deficits, as it slowed sensorimotor responding (FR5, 10 mg/kg) and disrupted short-term memory (DNMTP, 3 mg/kg, delay-dependent but no impairment at the zero second delay). BIP had no effect on food motivation (PR10) or attention.
Muscarinic m1 antagonists should be considered an interesting alternative for SCOP as a pharmacological model for cholinergic mnemonic deficits in animals.
We report what we believe to be only the 10th case of palatal necrosis secondary to cocaine abuse in a 33-year-old female patient. Extensive necrosis also involved the cartilaginous and bony septum and paranasal sinuses. Following exclusion of other mid-line destructive diseases her treatment involved saline douches and cessation of cocaine. She remains under review within the department with no evidence of progressive disease. We present a review of the other nine cases of palatal necrosis reported in the world literature and demonstrate a greater incidence in female users. The various presenting conditions of cocaine abuse encountered within the head and neck region by the otorhinolaryngologist are then discussed.
Down's syndrome (DS), a chromosomal disorder due to trisomy 21, results mostly from nondisjunction in maternal meiosis. The present case-control study examined the association of genetic polymorphisms with predisposition to nondisjunction. Two common polymorphisms (SNPs), C677T and A1298C, in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene involved in folate metabolism, are known to lower the activity of this enzyme. Three hundred and fourteen mothers (with DS children and controls), mostly from the eastern states of India, were genotyped for the two above-mentioned SNPs. Significant association with both of these SNPs were detected, more specifically, in the mothers of DS children homozygous for the polymorphic alleles 677 T and 1298 C. The relative risk of T (C677T) and C (A1298C) homozygosity in mothers for DS-affected pregnancy was 7 (OR 7.67, 95% CI 1.67-35.08, P=0.003) and 4 (OR 4.40, 95% CI 1.45-13.26, P=0.008), respectively. Moreover, all 677TT mothers studied were less than 31 years of age, whereas no correlation with maternal age was observed for A1298C genotypes. Interestingly, all of the young 677TT mothers had either a first- or secondborn child with DS. Thus, this study reports that young Indian mothers with TT genotypes are genetically predisposed to nondisjunction due to abnormal folate metabolism.
These experiments studied the effect of scopolamine on memory formation and subsequent memory recall. Different groups of rats were trained on a Y-maze brightness discrimination task 20 min after IP injection of 2 mg/kg scopolamine HBr, an anticholinergic. Retention tests were then conducted 1 day or 2, 4, or 6 weeks after training. Deficits in retention performance were observed at 1 day and 2 weeks after training but not at the longer intervals. In addition, other rats were trained in the same manner and after the same dose of scopolamine but were then retention tested 20 min after 0.5 mg/kg physostigmine salicylate, a cholinesterase inhibitor. These subjects also showed deficits at 1 day and 2 weeks but were not different from controls at the longer intervals. Amnesia was not, however, produced after treatment with scopolamine methyl nitrate or by injections of scopolamine HBr administered immediately after training. These results suggest that scopolamine, present in the central nervous system during training or within the first few moments thereafter, modifies the formation of the memory trace in such a way that memory is not available for recall for a period of weeks.
Levo-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP) is an alkaloid purified from the Chinese herb corydalis and stephania and is contained in many traditional Chinese herbal preparations. Our previous studies demonstrated the ability of l-THP to inhibit locomotor stimulation and physical dependence induced by oxycodone in mice and rats. The present study was designed to evaluate effects of l-THP on reward of oxycodone using conditioned place preference assay. Oxycodone (0.32-5.0 mg/kg) induced the development of conditioned place preference in rats. Furthermore, oxycodone (2.5 mg/kg) induced the increased phosphorylation of CREB and ERK in nucleus accumbens and hippocampus, but not in prefrontal cortex. l-THP (6.25-18.50 mg/kg) per se was not able to induce conditioned place preference or conditioned place aversion. l-THP co-administered with oxycodone during the conditioning sessions partly abolished the development of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference in rats. Furthermore, l-THP inhibited the increased phosphorylation of ERK and CREB in nucleus accumbens and hippocampus of rats. All these results suggest that l-THP can inhibit oxycodone-induced psychological dependence by affecting phosphorylation of CREB and ERK in nucleus accumbens and hippocampus of rats. Together, the present data, combined with previous finding, support the potential use of l-THP for treatment of oxycodone addiction.
A 75-year-old right-handed woman was admitted to our hospital because of sudden onset of consciousness disturbance. She had taken angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for hypertension. A neurological examination showed consciousness disturbance, total aphasia, right central facial palsy and right hemiparesis. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed hyper-intense lesions in the middle cerebral artery territory, particularly in the insular cortex. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Electrocardiogram monitoring during hospitalization detected an atrial fibrillation. Therefore, we diagnosed her as cardioembolic stroke. She was treated with intravenous alteplase of 0.6 mg/kg. Sixty minutes after alteplase infusion, she developed orolingual angioedema. Immediately she was treated with methylprednisolone intravenously, and the angioedema improved. Orolingual angioedema should be considered as a complication associated with alteplase in a patient who has taking ACE inhibitor.
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health problem that significantly impacts the physical and emotional well-being of women. In addition to the health risk associated with violence exposure, female victims of IPV are at increased risk of engaging in damaging health behaviors, including cigarette smoking. The present study examined patterns of cigarette smoking, using the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), and explored its association with sociodemographic factors, characteristics of physical, psychological, and sexual forms of IPV, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression within 62 female victims of severe battering. Fifty-eight percent of the total sample reported that they were current smokers. Within the group of current smokers, women who evidenced greater symptoms of nicotine-related physical dependence (NRPD) were more likely to be unemployed, have less education, experience more recent violence, more severe IPV-related sexual coercion, more IPV-related dominance/isolation, and more severe symptoms of PTSD and depression. In addition, greater symptoms of NRPD were significantly and positively associated with PTSD clusters of reexperiencing and arousal. Implications for these preliminary findings were discussed and directions for future research were detailed.
Drug naive rat hippocampal slices were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 20 nM clonazepam, a concentration approximating those measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rats treated with high doses of clonazepam which resulted in behavioral hyperexcitability and convulsions upon withdrawal. In the slice, epileptiform activity began within 2 h of incubation in clonazepam. This activity was enhanced upon drug withdrawal. Measured intracellularly, the long-lasting post-spike train afterhyperpolarization was reduced in duration in drug-treated cells whereas just subthreshold antidromic or orthodromic IPSPs were not changed. As some of the hyperexcitability phenomena noted here were similar to those observed in slices taken from rats chronically administered with clonazepam, the technique of long-term in vitro exposure to substances which cause tolerance and dependence may be a useful model of drug withdrawal epilepsy.
Serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI)-induced sexual dysfunction is common, and a number of pharmacologic adjunctive strategies have been employed to treat this vexing problem. This open label study tested the efficacy of adjunctive bupropion across several measures of sexual function. Patients taking SRIs for various mood or anxiety disorders who reported prospective decline in sexual function after at least 2 months on SRIs were offered treatment with bupropion, 75 mg/day. Eight patients were treated, and sexual function was measured by use of a visual analog scale at 1 month of treatment. Four of eight patients experienced marked improvement in sexual dysfunction following adjunctive bupropion treatment. Bupropion may be a pharmacologic option for treating SRI-associated sexual dysfunction, though controlled clinical trials are needed.
To study the effect of tenuifolic saponin (TS) on arterial pressure.
Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded from left carotid artery in rat which was anesthetized with urethane and then injected i.v. gtt with a transfusion of NaCl 0.15 mol.L-1. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) of conscious rat and renovascular hypertensive rat (RVHR) was measured by tail cuff method.
TS 2, 4, 8 mg.kg-1 i.v., 20 and 40 mg.kg-1 i.g. reduced the MAP by 31%, 37%, 50%, 21%, and 31%, respectively. Bilateral vagotomy plus atropine (Atr) i.v., or pretreatment with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Dip) failed to influence TS effect. Lack of effect of TS on carotid-occlusion-induced- or epinephrine (Epi)-induced-hypertensive response was found. SBP in conscious rat and RVHR was suppressed, highest by 38.0% and 26.8% at 60 and 90 min, maintaining at least 2 and 3 h, respectively, after i.g. TS 40 mg.kg-1.
TS reduced the arterial pressure, not related to vagus excitation, ganglionic blockade, and peripheral alpha-adrenergic-, M-cholinergic-, and H1-receptors.
Improved outcomes among patients with head and neck carcinomas require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy. Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single-agent paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) reported a 37% response rate in patients with head and neck cancer, and the paclitaxel/cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients. We initiated a phase I/II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed-dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma. To date, 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial. Primary tumor sites were oropharynx, 10 patients; hypopharynx, four; larynx, two; oral cavity, three; unknown primary, two; and nasal cavity and parotid gland, one each. Of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity, four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease. Treatment, given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles, consisted of paclitaxel by 3-hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg/m2). The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits. At the time of this writing, dose level 4 (260, 270, and 280 mg/m2) is being evaluated; three patients from this level are evaluable. With paclitaxel doses of 200 mg/m2 and higher, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d is given (days 4 through 12). Of 18 patients evaluable for response, seven (39%) achieved a complete response and six (33%) achieved a partial response. Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two. The overall response rate is 72%. Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery/radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy. Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses. Alopecia, paresthesias, and arthralgias/myalgias have occurred frequently, but with one exception (a grade 3 myalgia) they have been grade 1 or 2. No dose-limiting hematologic toxicity has been seen. Paclitaxel/cisplatin is an effective first-line regimen for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer and continued study is warranted. Results thus far suggest no dose-response effect for paclitaxel doses above 200 mg/m2.
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is characterized by repetitive, involuntary, and purposeless movements that develop in patients treated with long-term dopaminergic antagonists, usually antipsychotics. By a genome-wide association screening of TD in 50 Japanese schizophrenia patients with treatment-resistant TD and 50 Japanese schizophrenia patients without TD (non-TD group) and subsequent confirmation in independent samples of 36 treatment-resistant TD and 136 non-TD subjects, we identified association of a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2445142, (allelic p=2 x 10(-5)) in the HSPG2 (heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, perlecan) gene with TD. The risk allele was significantly associated with higher expression of HSPG2 in postmortem human prefrontal brain (p<0.01). Administration of daily injection of haloperidol (HDL) for 50 weeks significantly reduced Hspg2 expression in mouse brains (p<0.001). Vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) induced by 7-week injection of haloperidol-reserpine were significantly infrequent in adult Hspg2 hetero-knockout mice compared with wild-type littermates (p<0.001). Treatment by the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine, was significantly effective for reduction of VCMs in wild-type mice but not in Hspg2 hetero-knockout mice. These findings suggest that the HSPG2 gene is involved in neuroleptic-induced TD and higher expression of HSPG2, probably even after antipsychotic treatment, and may be associated with TD susceptibility.
Mechanisms of cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced nephrotoxicity were generally thought to be hemodynamic in origin; however, there is now accumulating evidence of a direct tubular effect. Although genomic and proteomic experiments by our group and others provided overall information on genes and proteins up- or down-regulated by CsA in proximal tubule cells (PTC), a comprehensive view of events occurring after CsA exposure remains to be described. For this purpose, we applied a pharmacologic approach based on the use of known activities of a large panel of potentially protective compounds and evaluated their efficacy in preventing CsA toxicity in cultured mouse PTC. Our results show that compounds that blocked protein synthesis and apoptosis, together with the CK2 inhibitor DMAT and the PI3K inhibitor apigenin, were the most efficient in preventing CsA toxicity. We also identified GSK3, MMPs and PKC pathways as potential targets to prevent CsA damage. Additionally, heparinase-I and MAPK inhibitors afforded partial but significant protection. Interestingly, antioxidants and calcium metabolism-related compounds were unable to ameliorate CsA-induced cytotoxicity. Subsequent experiments allowed us to clarify the hierarchical relationship of targeted pathways after CsA treatment, with ER stress identified as an early effector of CsA toxicity, which leads to ROS generation, phenotypical changes and cell death. In summary, this work presents a novel experimental approach to characterizing cellular responses to cytotoxics while pointing to new targets to prevent CsA-induced toxicity in proximal tubule cells.
Angina pectoris, arrhythmic sudden death and myocardial infarction, all these cardiac events have occasionally been reported during 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy. Underlying mechanisms leading to these events are unknown; damage to the myocytes or vasospasms have been discussed.
102 consecutive and unselected patients were monitored with 12-lead ECG, echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography prior to the first cycle of 5-FU chemotherapy and 3 months from baseline.
19% of the patients developed reversible symptoms of angina pectoris during treatment which lasted up to 12 h after cessation of the infusion. Most of the 19 patients showed corresponding ECG changes. 6 out of the 19 patients with severe angina pectoris had subsequent coronary angiography. In none of these patients the coronary angiography showed coronary artery disease, but it showed low ventricular function (ejection fraction <50%) in 2 patients. The ejection fraction did not increase over time. Arrhythmias were screened for with Holter monitoring during 5-FU chemotherapy. The frequency of bradycardia and ventricular extrasystoles increased significantly (p < 0.05) during treatment compared to arrhythmias in Holter monitoring 3 months later. Furthermore the Qtc time in the ECG 3 months later was significantly prolonged (p < 0.05) compared to baseline values.
The incidence of angina pectoris in patients during 5-FU treatment seems higher than previously suspected. As myocardial ischemia can be fatal, attentiveness to these symptoms and immediate treatment are crucial.
