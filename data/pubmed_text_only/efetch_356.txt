Chromosomal rearrangements involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) at 2p23 result in fusion with various partner genes leading to aberrant production of oncogenic protein products in multiple tumor types. Recently, the ALK protein inhibitor crizotinib was shown to be an effective therapy in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of ALK alterations in adult renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and define associated clinicopathologic features and outcome. RCCs from a cohort of 534 consecutive surgically treated adult patients were analyzed for alterations of ALK by fluorescence in situ hybridization. ALK rearrangements were identified in 2 of 534 (<1%) RCCs. Both showed similar histologic features and the patients had a poor outcome. ALK copy number gain was identified in 54 (10%) RCCs. In clear cell type RCC (CCRCC), ALK copy number gain was significantly associated with tumor size (P=0.02) and nuclear grade (P<0.001), and with a worse 10-year cancer-specific survival vs similar patients lacking ALK copy number gain (P=0.03). ALK rearrangement is rare in adult RCC but may be associated with distinct histological features and poor outcome. Another potential mechanism to elevate ALK expression, increased ALK gene copy number, was observed in 10% of adult CCRCC, where it is associated with a higher tumor grade and poorer outcome. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether patients RCCs with ALK rearrangement and/or those with an increase in ALK copy number would benefit from ALK inhibitor treatment.
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was limited until recently by poor graft and patient outcomes caused by recurrent HBV. Long-term immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) dramatically improved post-OLT survival, but recurrent HBV still occurred in up to 36% of the recipients. More recently, combination HBIG and lamivudine has been shown to effectively prevent HBV recurrence in patients post-OLT. The aim of the current study is to determine long-term outcome and cost-effectiveness of using combination HBIG and lamivudine compared with HBIG monotherapy in patients who undergo OLT for HBV. A retrospective chart review identified 59 patients administered combination HBIG and lamivudine and 12 patients administered HBIG monotherapy as primary prophylaxis against recurrent HBV. Lamivudine, 150 mg/d, was administered orally indefinitely. HBIG was administered under a standard protocol (10,000 IU intravenously during the anhepatic phase, then 10,000 IU/d intravenously for 7 days, then 10,000 IU intravenously monthly) indefinitely. A decision-analysis model was developed to evaluate the potential economic impact of prophylaxis against HBV with combination therapy compared with monotherapy. Recurrent HBV was defined as the reappearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) after its initial disappearance post-OLT. In the combination-therapy group, no patient redeveloped serum HBsAg or HBV DNA during mean follow-ups of 459 and 416 days, respectively. In the monotherapy group, 3 patients (25%) had reappearance of HBsAg in serum during a mean follow-up of 663 days. Combination therapy resulted in a dominant, cost-effective strategy with an average cost-effectiveness ratio of $252,111/recurrence prevented compared with $362,570/recurrence prevented in the monotherapy strategy. Combination prophylaxis with HBIG and lamivudine is highly effective in preventing recurrent HBV, may protect against the emergence of resistant mutants, and is significantly more cost-effective than HBIG monotherapy with its associated rate of recurrent HBV.
Tranilast, an antiallergic drug, is well known as a causal drug of cystitis, and a report is made here of our experience of 1 case of drug-induced cystitis ascribable to ketotifen fumarate. A 13-year-old female had been taking anti-asthmatic drugs orally since the onset of athmatoid attacks, from age of 5. The attacks intensified from the age of 12, because of this she began to take various anti-asthmatic drugs orally. She visited another hospital, due to pollakisuria, in November, 1990, and received treatment for cystitis. However, the symptoms were not alleviated, and she visited our department on January 9, 1991. By urinalysis, large counts of leukocytes and erythrocytes were observed in a visual field of the sediment. Remarkable reddening was observed over the urinary bladder in the patient's cystoscopic findings. Treatment was given at our department, on an outpatient basis, with various antibacterial drugs for approximately one month, but her symptoms were not alleviated, pollakisuria and aseptic pyuria persisted. The patient had never taken tranilast; oral intake of ketotifen fumarate and saibokutou was discontinued on February 13, due to a suspicion of drug-induced cystitis, and her symptoms subsequently disappeared. On February 22, she took ketotifen fumarate orally again, on her own, due to asthmatoid attack, and her symptoms returned. The oral intake of ketotifen fumarate was again discontinued, and alleviation of the symptoms and normalization of the urinary findings were again observed. As a result, lymphocyte stimulation tests on all the drugs the patient had ever taken, only ketotifen fumarate turned out to be positive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Valproic acid-associated hyperammonemic encephalopathy (VHE) has been described in the neurology and emergency medicine literature, but the case reports identified therein are rarely derived from the psychiatric use of this medication. Valproic acid is widely used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar affective disorder and schizoaffective disorder. Patients with normal blood levels, liver function and metabolic tests may present with markedly elevated ammonia and a variety of neurological symptoms. We report the case of a patient on long-term valproic acid therapy, with stable dosing, who presented with an elevated ammonia level, new-onset tremor, confusion, and loss of consciousness. This case illustrates the need to check ammonia levels in psychiatric patients who are taking valproic acid and who present with new neurological symptoms.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is the rarest and most serious of the neuroleptic-induced movement disorders. We describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with the use of ziprasidone. Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with NMS, atypical antipsychotic drugs like ziprasidone may also be a cause. The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms of NMS after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated ziprasidone. This case is the earliest (second day of treatment) NMS due to ziprasidone reported in the literature.
Topical application of capsaicin to the gastric mucosa results in marked hyperemia as a consequence of the release of vasoactive neuropeptides from sensory afferent neurons. Because many of these neuropeptides have the capacity to induce mast cell degranulation, we investigated the possible contribution of mast cells to capsaicin-induced hyperemia. Application of capsaicin to the gastric mucosa of normal rats resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in blood flow. In rats in which mastocytosis was induced by prior infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, the hyperemic responses to capsaicin were significantly greater than in control rats. This augmented hyperemic response could be significantly attenuated by pretreatment with a histamine H1-receptor antagonist (pyrilamine) or with a mast cell stabilizer (doxantrazole). Depletion of mucosal mast cells through treatment with dexamethasone also significantly reduced the hyperemic response to capsaicin. Hyperemic response to capsaicin in normal rats and in rats with mucosal mastocytosis could be completely abolished by pretreatment with ruthenium red or prior ablation of the sensory afferent neurons with capsaicin. These results suggest that in rats with gastric mastocytosis, sensory neuron-dependent activation of mast cells contributes to the hyperemic response to topical capsaicin. These findings are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that there is communication between nerves and mast cells in the gastric mucosa, at least in rats previously infected with N. brasiliensis.
In order to elucidate the neural mechanisms of delirium, we administered the anticholinergic drug, biperiden (40 mg/kg i.p.), to 10 adult male Wistar rats and examined the resulting polygraphic recordings, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electromyography (EMG), for 60 min following injection. EEG data were investigated quantitatively by power spectrum analyses using fast Fourier transformation. Ten male Wistar rats receiving saline (i.p.) were used as the control group.
Treated rats demonstrated two types of alternating behavioral change: a hyperactive and hypoactive state. In the hyperactive state, rapid walking, excessive random sniffing, and retropulsion were observed, with EEG desynchronization (significantly increased alpha1 (8.0-10.0 Hz), alpha2 (10.0-13.0 Hz), and beta (13.0-30.0 Hz) power values), as well as EEG slowing (significantly increased delta (0.5-4.0 Hz) and theta1 (4.0-6.0 Hz) power values): significantly marked rapid eye movement, and increased EMG activity. In the hypoactive state, motor arrest and drowsiness were observed, with prominent EEG slowing (significantly increased delta and theta1 power values): significantly decreased rapid eye movement and moderately decreased EMG activity. On the other hand, the control group did not show any behavioral or polygraphic changes.
The behavioral and polygraphic changes induced by biperiden administration in rats are similar to those of delirium in humans. Therefore, it is proposed that biperiden-treated rats are a good delirium model and the anticholinergic mechanism is one of the potent factors in the development of delirium in humans.
The present study was undertaken to get insight in the possible mechanisms of imipramine-induced seizures in amygdala-kindled rats. The intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of imipramine produced potent behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) seizures in amygdala-kindled rats. Histidine (1500 mg/kg, i.p.) and histamine (10 and 20 microg, i.c.v.) significantly attenuated the seizures induced by imipramine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) in kindled rats. In addition, the inhibition of imipramine-induced seizures by histamine (20 microg, i.c.v.) was antagonized by an H1 antagonist, pyrilamine. An H3 antagonist, thioperamide (50 microg, i.c.v.), also significantly attenuated the imipramine-induced seizures in kindled rats. The i.p. injection of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine at a dose of 250 mg/kg significantly diminished the seizures induced by imipramine. However, p-chlorophenylalanine and physostigmine did not affect the imipramine-induced seizures to any extent. These data give strong hints that the H1 receptor antagonistic properties and the brain noradrenaline activating effects of imipramine are centrally involved in imipramine-induced seizures, and central serotonergic and cholinergic neurotransmissions are not involved in the seizures induced by imipramine in amygdala-kindled rats.
Beginning 2 weeks after an intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN), rats were fed diet containing either 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-Me-DAB), alpha-isomer of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), or phenobarbital (PB) for 6 weeks and subjected to partial hepatectomy (PH) after various periods of chemical administration. The effect of timing of PH was most apparent in rats fed 2-AAF. The size of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase positive foci was largest when PH was performed 1-3 weeks after the start of chemical feeding. Similar tendency was slightly observed with 3'-Me-DAB or alpha-HCH administration, but not with PB or basal diet feeding. Thus, the enhancing effect of PH on the induction of the preneoplastic liver foci was affected by the type of chemical and the timing of the operation.
Nutrigenomics elucidate the ability of bioactive food components to influence gene expression, protein synthesis, degradation and post-translational modifications.Resveratrol (RSV), natural polyphenol found in grapes and in other fruits, has a plethora of health benefits in a variety of human diseases: cardio- and neuroprotection, immune regulation, cancer chemoprevention, DNA repair, prevention of mitochondrial disorder, avoidance of obesity-related diseases. In skeletal muscle, RSV acts on protein catabolism and muscle function, conferring resistance against oxidative stress, injury and cell death, but its action mechanisms and protein targets in myogenesis process are not completely known. Myogenesis is a dynamic multistep process regulated by Myogenic Regulator Factors (MRFs), responsible of the commitment of myogenic cell into skeletal muscle: mononucleated undifferentiated myoblasts break free from cell cycle, elongate and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes. Skeletal muscle hypertrophy can be defined as a result of an increase in the size of pre-existing skeletal muscle fibers accompanied by increased protein synthesis, mainly regulated by Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), PI3-K/AKT signaling pathways.Aim of this work was the study of RSV effects on proliferation, differentiation process and hypertrophy in C2C12 murine cells.
To study proliferative phase, cells were incubated in growth medium with/without RSV (0.1 or 25 μM) until reaching sub confluence condition (24, 48, 72 h). To examine differentiation, at 70% confluence, cells were transferred in differentiation medium both with/without RSV (0.1 or 25 μM) for 24, 48, 72, 96 hours. After 72 hours of differentiation, the genesis of hypertrophy in neo-formed myotubes was analyzed.
Data showed that RSV regulates cell cycle exit and induces C2C12 muscle differentiation. Furthermore, RSV might control MRFs and muscle-specific proteins synthesis. In late differentiation, RSV has positive effects on hypertrophy: RSV stimulates IGF-1 signaling pathway, in particular AKT and ERK 1/2 protein activation, AMPK protein level and induces hypertrophic morphological changes in neo-formed myotubes modulating cytoskeletal proteins expression.
RSV might control cell cycle promoting myogenesis and hypertrophy in vitro, opening a novel field of application of RSV in clinical conditions characterized by chronic functional and morphological muscle impairment.
Previous studies evaluating short-term itraconazole and terbinafine therapy for onychomycosis have varied in protocol and size; this double-blind study enabled a large-scale, standardized, direct comparison. Patients with toenail onychomycosis were randomized to itraconazole 200 mg daily (n = 146) or terbinafine 250 mg daily (n = 146) for 12 weeks, with a 36-week follow-up. Mycological cure rates at the follow-up end-point were significantly equivalent (61% with itraconazole vs. 67% with terbinafine). A similar proportion of patients in each group experienced adverse events during treatment (itraconazole, 22%; terbinafine, 23%). More patients receiving terbinafine stopped treatment permanently because of treatment-related adverse events (8% vs. 1%).
Exposure to lead (Pb) can induce kidney damage, which is related to induction of oxidative damage and disturbance of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Pb can readily permeate through dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type calcium channels and accumulate within cells. The objective of this study was to investigate protective effects of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) verapamil and nimodipine on nephrotoxicity induced by Pb acetate in mice. One hundred and twenty male mice were randomly divided into 6 groups: control, Pb, low-dose verapamil, high-dose verapamil, low-dose nimodipine and high-dose nimodipine (n=20 per group). Pb acetate was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 40 mg/kg body weight/day for 10 days to establish the Pb toxicity model. While control mice received saline, mice of the treated groups simultaneously received i.p. injections of verapamil or nimodipine daily for 10 days. Both verapamil and nimodipine showed protection against Pb-induced kidney injury, including alleviation of renal pathological damage and decreasing the level of Pb in kidney homogenate and extent of apoptosis in nephrocytes. Moreover, verapamil and nimodipine significantly down-regulated levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in the serum. In addition, verapamil and nimodipine administration decreased malondialdehyde content and increased activities of super oxide dismutase activity and glutathione peroxidase in the kidney homogenate. The findings in the present study implicate the therapeutic potential of CCBs for Pb-induced nephrotoxicity, which were at least partly due to the decrease of Pb uptake and inhibition of lipid peroxidation.
We conducted a phase I trial of caracemide, a new chemotherapeutic agent, which is active in the MX1 (mammary) and CX1 (colon) human tumor xenografts. Using a 5-day bolus schedule, dose-limiting toxicity consisting of burning perioral pain associated with flushing, nasal stuffiness, and excess lacrimation was seen at 650 mg/m2/day. Using a 5-day continuous-infusion schedule, dose-limiting toxicity in the form of changes in affect, lethargy, disorientation, and cognitive dysfunction with electroencephalogram abnormalities was noted at 800 mg/m2/day. The recommended phase II dose levels are 525 mg/m2/day using the 5-day bolus schedule and 650 mg/m2/day using the continuous-infusion schedule. Because of venous pain at the site of infusion, the drug must be delivered via central venous access. The pathophysiology of both the peripheral and central side effects of caracemide may be related to increased cholinergic activity.
Dysphoric reactions to antipsychotic medication are well recognised in association with akathisia, but can also occur independently.
Fifty-one healthy volunteers were given haloperidol 5 mg in two consecutive pharmacokinetic studies.
Dysphoria occurred in about 40% of the subjects on both occasions, but akathisia was only detected in 8% (first study) and 16% (second study). All adverse effects were transient and were abolished in nine of the ten subjects given procyclidine.
While dysphoria is a well-recognized reaction in healthy volunteers, it is probably insufficiently recognised in patients, particularly if it occurs in the absence of akathisia. Better detection could improve compliance in patients.
Cetamolol, a new beta-adrenoceptor blocker with partial agonist activity and cardioselectivity, was studied in vivo to determine its membrane-stabilizing effects. Comparisons were carried out with atenolol, pindolol, practolol, propranolol, timolol, dexpropranolol, lidocaine, and procaine. The following results indicated that cetamolol lacked membrane-stabilizing activity: (i) failure to cause local anesthesia on the rabbit cornea and motor nerve of the rat tail; (ii) ineffectiveness in reversing ventricular arrhythmias induced by coronary artery litigation in dogs; (iii) failure to reduce cardiac automaticity in catecholamine-depleted dogs as determined by the rate of a subatrial rhythm during ventricular (vagal) escape; and (iv) lack of a significant increase in atrioventricular conduction time in vagotomized or atropinized dogs in contrast to the effect in normal dogs indicating a reflex effect of cetamolol. Other results include a restoration of sinus rhythm in dogs with ventricular tachycardia induced by ouabain, and a dose-related decline in the force of cardiac contraction in anesthetized dogs at doses from 3 to 15 mg/kg, which occurred after an initial increase in force owing to intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Although the mechanisms for the latter two effects are not clear at this time, explanations other than membrane-stabilizing activity have been considered in view of the other findings. It is concluded that cetamolol lacks membrane-stabilizing activity even at inordinately high doses.
A broad spectrum of biological activities has been proposed for transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-beta 3). To study TGF-beta 3 function in development, TGF-beta 3 null mutant mice were generated by gene-targeting. Within 20 hours of birth, homozygous TGF-beta 3-/- mice die with unique and consistent phenotypic features including delayed pulmonary development and defective palatogenesis. Unlike other null mutants with cleft palate, TGF-beta 3-/- mice lack other concomitant craniofacial abnormalities. This study demonstrates an essential function for TGF-beta 3 in the normal morphogenesis of palate and lung, and directly implicates this cytokine in mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction.
Proteinuria is a side effect of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients. The possibility of reproducing the same renal abnormality with captopril was examined in SHR. Oral administration of captopril at 100 mg/kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre-existing in SHR. Also, captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria invoked by puromycin aminonucleoside in SHR. Captopril had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations, excretion of urine, sodium and potassium, endogenous creatinine clearance, body weight, and food and water consumption. However, ketone bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of captopril in SHR.
Stellate ganglion block is a selective sympathetic block that affects the ipsilateral head, neck, upper extremity and upper part of the thorax. Convulsions are a recognized complication of intra-arterial injection during stellate ganglion block. As central nervous system toxicity depends ultimately on the concentration of the local anaesthetics presented to the brain, the likely causative factors are discussed as well as the types of toxic symptoms and their onset times. The paper considers the aetiological factors of such convulsions resulting from stellate ganglion block in two patients.
To examine the role of the ventral anteroventral third ventricle (vAV3V) in the hypertension induced by chronic subcutaneous ouabain and intracerebroventricular hypertonic saline, neurons in this area were destroyed by microinjection of an excitotoxin, ibotenic acid. Sham-operated or lesioned Wistar rats were administered ouabain (50 microgram/day) or placebo for 3 wk from subcutaneously implanted controlled release pellets or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or CSF containing 0.8 mol/l NaCl (5 microliter/h) infused intracerebroventricularly for 2 wk. At the end of the experiment, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate at rest and in response to ganglionic blockade by intravenous hexamethonium (30 mg/kg) were assessed. In rats infused with hypertonic saline, responses to air jet stress were also assessed. Baseline MAP in sham-operated rats receiving intracerebroventricular hypertonic saline or subcutaneous ouabain was significantly higher than in control rats (115 +/- 1 vs. 97 +/- 3 and 121 +/- 3 vs. 103 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively). vAV3V lesions abolished the increase in MAP elicited by chronic infusion of hypertonic saline or administration of ouabain. Sham-operated rats treated with hypertonic saline or ouabain exhibited significantly enhanced decreases in MAP to hexamethonium, but lesioned rats did not. Rats infused with hypertonic saline demonstrated enhanced responses to air jet stress that were similar in sham-operated and lesioned rats. These results demonstrate that neurons in the vAV3V are essential for the hypertension induced by intracerebroventricular hypertonic saline and subcutaneous ouabain, possibly by increasing sympathetic tone. Cardiovascular responses to air jet stress appear not to be mediated by the vAV3V.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with an increased mortality rate. We observed the participants of the Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial (SADHART) to establish features of MDD associated with long-term mortality.
To determine whether the following variables were associated with long-term mortality: baseline depression severity, previous MDD episodes, onset of MDD before or after the ACS event, 6 months of sertraline hydrochloride therapy, and mood improvement independent of treatment.
SADHART was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial comparing the safety and antidepressant efficacy of sertraline vs placebo in 369 patients with ACS who met criteria for MDD. The trial was completed in June 2000, and follow-up for vital status was completed in September 2007.
Academic research.
SADHART participants.
Vital status was determined in 361 participants (97.8%) during a median follow-up of 6.7 years.
During the study, 75 participants (20.9%) died. Neither previous episodes of MDD, nor onset before or after the index ACS, nor an initial 6 months of sertraline treatment was associated with long-term mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression models showed that baseline MDD severity (hazard ratio, 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-4.14; P < .006) and failure of MDD to improve substantially during treatment with either sertraline or placebo (hazard ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-2.44; P < .001) were strongly and independently associated with long-term mortality. Marked improvement in depression (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement subscale score of 1) was associated with improved adherence to study medication.
Severity of MDD measured within a few weeks of hospitalization for ACS or failure of MDD to improve during the 6 months following ACS predicted more than a doubling of mortality over 6.7 years of follow-up. Because persistent depression increases mortality and decreases medication adherence, physicians need to aggressively treat depression and be diligent in promoting adherence to guideline cardiovascular drug therapy.
Preservation of the cavernous nerves (CNs) during radical prostatectomy is crucial for the patient's erectile function. Despite advances in operative technique, the majority of men report compromised erectile function postprostatectomy or complete loss of potency due to CN trauma even with nerve-sparing modifications.
  This study was designed to investigate whether repeated dosing of udenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, helps to improve erectile function after CN injury.
Using the CN crush injury model, 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into the following groups; sham-operated group, bilateral CN crush injury exposed to either no udenafil (vehicle) or udenafil (5, 20 mg/kg) daily for two different durations (4 and 8 weeks, p.o.).
At both time points, CN electrical stimulation was used to assess erectile function by measuring the intracavernous pressure. The expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β1), nerve growth factor (NGF), endothelin B receptor (ET(B) ), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and sonic hedgehog homolog (SHH) in penile tissue were examined. Immunohistochemical antibody staining was performed for NGF, eNOS, nNOS, CD31, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Additionally, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling assay was performed to quantify apoptosis and the tissue slides were stained for Masson's trichrome to assess the smooth muscle/collagen ratio.
Udenafil improved erectile function in a dose- and time-dependent manner with the maximum erectile function recovery achieved by 20 mg/kg udenafil at an 8-week time point. CN injury increased the expression of HIF-1α, TGF-β1, NGF, and ET(B) , however, decreased the expression of eNOS, nNOS, and SHH. Udenafil significantly suppressed these alterations. The results from the histological analyses show that udenafil markedly reduces apoptosis induced by CN injury and augments the smooth muscle/collagen ratio.
CN injury induces significantly impaired erectile function and altered gene/protein expression. Chronic administration of udenafil preserves erectile function and has a beneficial role against the pathophysiological consequences of CN injury.
Aluminum phosphide (ALP) is used worldwide to fumigate grain. ALP poisoning, though reported from different parts of world, is most common in north, northwest and central India. In the presence of moisture, ALP liberates phosphine, which is highly toxic. The mechanism of action of phosphine is not known though experimental studies show that it inhibits cytochrome-c oxidase leading to inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
We estimated cytochrome-c oxidase activity in platelets of patients who had ingested ALP and compared them with those in healthy controls and in patients with shock due to other causes (cardiogenic shock, septic shock and hemorrhagic shock).
After analysis of variance using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann Whitney U test, significant inhibition of cytochrome-c oxidase activity could be found in ALP-poisoned patients compared to healthy controls (z = -5.513, p < 0.001) and in patients with shock due to other causes (z = -2.344; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in inhibition in those who survived ALP poisoning compared to those who died from ALP poisoning (t = 0.02768; p > 0.05).
Though inhibition of cytochrome-c oxidase in platelets does not have prognostic value, it suggests that interruption of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as a result of cytochrome-c oxidase inhibition may lead to multi-organ dysfunction and therapeutic strategies to maintain enzyme activity may help in managing these patients.
Ortho,para,dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane (o,p'DDD, Mitotane (Roussell)) is used as an adrenolytic drug to reduce adrenocortical mass and circulating cortisol levels in Cushing's syndrome but has the unwanted side-effect of inducing hypercholesterolaemia. This paper examined the mechanism of that effect in 30 patients with Cushing's syndrome treated with o,p'DDD during the past 10 years. o,p'DDD increased serum cholesterol by 68 per cent, mainly by increasing LDL-cholesterol. The latter effect was not due to impaired binding of LDL to its receptor, as shown in vitro using cultured fibroblasts. Increases in plasma mevalonic acid during o,p'DDD administration were suggestive of increased cholesterol synthesis, this effect being reversed by simvastatin. These findings suggest that o,p'DDD causes hypercholesterolaemia by increasing cholesterol synthesis. It is proposed that this effect is due to the drug's known ability to block cytochrome P450-mediated reactions, thus impairing the formation of oxysterols responsible for down-regulating hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Treatment with simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, reverses the hyperlipidaemia and enables o,p'DDD therapy to be maintained without increasing cardiovascular risk.
A series of novel arylpiperazines bearing a 3,3-diphenylpyrrolidin-2-one fragment were synthesized and evaluated for their binding affinity for alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors (ARs), as well as their antiarrhythmic, and antihypertensive activities. The highest affinity for the alpha(1)-AR was displayed by 1-{3-[4-(2-ethoxy-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-2-hydroxy-propyl}-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidin-2-one (7), which binds with a pK(i)=7.28. The highest affinity for the alpha(2)-AR was shown by 1-{3-[4-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-2-hydroxy-propyl}-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidin-2-one (5), which binds with a pK(i)=6.68. Compound 7 was additionally evaluated in in vitro functional tests for its affinity for alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-AR, which gave pA(2) alpha(1B)=6.55 and pA(2) alpha(1D)=7.26. Among the compounds tested, compound 7 also had the highest prophylactic antiarrhythmic activity in adrenaline-induced arrhythmia in anaesthetized rats. Its ED(50) value was 1.1mg/kg (i.v.). The compounds significantly decreased systolic and diastolic pressure in normotensive anaesthetized rats at doses of 2.5-5.0mg/kg (i.v.) and their hypotensive effects lasted for longer than 1h. It was found that the introduction of two phenyl ring substituents into the 3rd position of the pyrrolidin-2-one fragment gave compounds with affinity for both alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-AR. The substitution of the 2nd position in the phenyl piperazinyl fragment of the molecule was crucial for activity. To determine detailed information concerning the structure-activity relationship, a preliminary molecular modeling study was undertaken.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is used for treatment of lupus erythematosus. The cardiac toxicity of HCQ has focused primarily on acute intoxication. We report a case of chronic use of HCQ associated with torsade de pointes.
A 67-year-old female presented with acquired long QT interval syndrome with a refractory ventricular arrhythmia. She was receiving chronic therapeutic doses of HCQ for the treatment of lupus erythematosus. Torsades de pointes was diagnosed in the Emergency Department (ED). After excluding other causes of long QT syndrome, the HCQ was suspected as the cause of her ventricular tachycardia. After discontinuing the HCQ, the QT interval was shorter and the patient recovered after treatment with lidocaine and isoproterenol.
The chronic use of HCQ for rheumatic diseases, or as an anti-malarial drug, should be balanced against the risk of developing potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias.
