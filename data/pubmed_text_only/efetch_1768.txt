We have studied the effect of blood pressure control upon left ventricular mass and function. Twenty hypertensive patients without clinical or electrocardiographic signs of cardiac involvement were given sequentially: placebo for two weeks; captopril (250 mg/day) for eight weeks; and captopril (125 mg/day), alone or combined with chlorthalidone (25 mg/day), for eight weeks. M-mode echocardiography was performed at the end of placebo period, after eight and after 16 weeks active treatment. Blood pressure was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) by therapy, the maximum decrease being observed at the end of the study. Similarly, interventricular septal thickness, posterior wall thickness and left ventricular mass index showed a significant reduction (P less than 0.01 at the eighth and P less than 0.001 at the 16th week), while no changes were detected in left ventricular function. Furthermore, both wall stress index at end-diastole and end-systolic stress were significantly lowered by treatment (at the 16th week P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.001, respectively). Baseline systolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with the ratio of the left ventricular radius to posterior wall thickness (r = -0.97, P less than 0.001) but no relation was found between post-treatment fall in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure and left ventricular mass index. After treatment more patients showed normal left ventricular wall thickness in relation to systolic blood pressure. We conclude that in uncomplicated hypertensive patients captopril, either alone or combined with chlorthalidone, can reverse left ventricular hypertrophy by decreasing both septal and posterior wall thickness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Benzodiazepines, a class of drugs widely employed as anxiolytics and anticonvulsants, can induce impairments of learning and memory. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), could enhance learning and memory. Pretraining injection of flumazenil (2.5 to 40.0 mg/kg) was found to enhance both learning and memory in a test requiring young mice to discriminate the correct arm of a T-maze to escape mild electric shock. In a second test, which required mice to passively avoid a dark chamber after shock, flumazenil pretreatment prevented the occurrence of amnesia induced by the cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine. It is hypothesized that flumazenil may facilitate learning or memory processes by reversing a negative modulatory influence of endogenous diazepam-like ligands for benzodiazepine receptors.
To determine if factor VIII-von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex is involved in the thrombosis associated with asparaginase-prednisone-vincristine induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, plasma vWF was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Five patients with cerebral thrombosis were studied; all had a decreased platelet count following the complication. Sequential studies of three patients disclosed changes in plasma vWF multimer pattern. One patient who was studied serially from 2 days before to 1 day after the event, had an increase in unusually large plasma vWF multimers that disappeared after the complication. The other two patients who were studied at presentation subsequently showed a decrease in plasma large vWF multimers, especially remarkable in the patient having the sharpest decrease in platelet count. No appreciable difference in vWF multimer pattern, when compared to normal pooled plasma, was found in the remaining two patients who were only studied at presentation, or in the seven controls who received the same treatment but did not develop thrombosis. Crossed immunoelectrophoretic analyses of two patients tested disclosed a right shift of immunoprecipitin line in one and a left shift in the other. Our findings suggest that the thrombotic complications resulted from platelet agglutination by plasma vWF.
Cardiotoxicity, which may result from intense cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation, is the main limiting factor of the anticancer therapy using doxorubicin. Because statins might exert beneficial pleiotropic cardiovascular effects, among other things, by anti-inflammatory and antioxidative mechanisms, we investigated whether or not fluvastatin pretreatment can attenuate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Five days after a single injection of doxorubicin (20 mg/kg; i.p.), left ventricular (LV) function was measured in fluvastatin-treated (DoxStatin; 100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and saline-treated (doxorubicin) mice (n = 8 per group) by a micro conductance catheter. Untreated mice served as controls (placebo; n = 8 per group). After measurement of cardiac function, LV tissues were analyzed by molecular biological and immunohistologic methods. Injection resulted in significantly impaired LV function (LV pressure, -29%; dp/dtmax, -45%; cardiac output, -68%; P < 0.05) when compared with placebo. This was associated with a significant increase in cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic mechanisms, as indicated by significant increased cardiac lipid peroxidation activity, protein expression of nitrotyrosine, tumor necrosis factor alpha and Bax (P < 0.05). In contrast, DoxStatin mice showed improved LV function (LV pressure, +24%; dp/dtmax, +87%; cardiac output, +87%; P < 0.05) when compared with untreated doxorubicin mice. This was associated with reduced cardiac expression of nitrotyrosine, enhanced expression of the mitochondrial located antioxidative SOD 2, attenuated mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, and reduced cardiac inflammatory response. Statin pretreatment attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.
To report the occurrence of recurrent benzodiazepine withdrawal reactions in two very young children following discontinuation of sedation with midazolam.
A 15-month-old boy with apneic episodes was sedated with midazolam for 12 days with constant infusion. Half a day after discontinuation of the midazolam the boy became restless, tachycardic, and hyperpyrexic. When midazolam was readministered, all symptoms disappeared. Four days later midazolam was again discontinued and within 12 hours the same signs and symptoms reappeared. Midazolam infusion was restarted, and the signs and symptoms disappeared for the second time. After thoracotomy, a 14-day-old boy received intravenous midazolam for sedation for 29 days. Within 12 hours after discontinuation of midazolam he became restless, developed a bulging stomach secondary to aerophagia, and was vomiting. Midazolam therapy was reinstituted and continued for another 2 months by constant infusion. Thereafter, the boy was successfully weaned from artificial ventilation in 5 days under sedation with midazolam. About 12 hours after discontinuation of midazolam the boy became restless, tachycardic, again developed a bulging stomach because of aerophagia, and vomited. When the child was sedated with clorazepate by continuous infusion, the signs and symptoms disappeared.
Case reports describing benzodiazepine withdrawal reaction upon discontinuation of midazolam were reviewed and compared. The symptoms observed in the children we present resemble those mentioned in the three children and two adults reported previously. Unique in the very young children in this article is the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, which most likely are the result of air being swallowed secondary to severe agitation.
Midazolam withdrawal reactions in adults and children, particularly in an intensive care unit, can be significant. Considerable caution must be taken with relatively long-term administration and abrupt discontinuation of midazolam.
To report a case of hyperammonemia without hepatic dysfunction as a possible cause of lethargy, stupor, and coma in a woman after valproic acid (VPA) administration, and discuss the possible different mechanisms of ammonia elevation and coma.
A woman diagnosed with complex partial seizures that secondarily generalize was treated with phenytoin (PHT) 250 mg/d for 18 years. Three months before admission, this dosage was increased to 300 mg/d and phenobarbital (PB) 100 mg/d was added because the seizures were incompletely controlled. The patient developed a progressive inability to walk. She was diagnosed as having PHT intoxication. VPA therapy was begun while PHT was being tapered and progressive impairment of consciousness occurred. This evolved into a coma without focal neurologic signs, and was accompanied by isolated hyperammonemia without hepatic failure.
Adverse effects attributable to VPA were reviewed in the literature. Occasionally, VPA may lead to severe secondary effects such as hepatic failure and coma. In these cases increased blood concentrations of transaminases, bilirubin, and ammonia have been found. Several reports have stressed the existence of hyperammonemic coma without biochemical evidence of hepatic failure, which is what occurred in our patient. This suggests that isolated hyperammonemia and hepatic failure after VPA treatment may have a different biochemical basis.
VPA-induced coma with hyperammonemia and without evidence of hepatic failure should be considered in patients being treated with PHT or PB when VPA is administered concomitantly. This case report shows the importance of clinical monitoring and immediate drug discontinuation when drowsiness, gastrointestinal symptoms, or lethargy occur.
Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) is caused by mutations in LMNA, the gene that encodes nuclear lamins A and C. FPLD is characterized by peripheral fat loss, excess central adiposity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidaemia, which are difficult to treat. We present our 2 years' experience of treatment with rosiglitazone in a subject with FPLD. Insulin requirement decreased significantly from 240 IU/day to 76 IU/day (range 20-240 IU/day) and serum triglyceride concentration was lowered from 13.7 +/- 14.4 mmol/l to 4.5 +/- 4.3 mmol/l and remained stable. Mean HbA(1c) prior to rosiglitazone therapy was 9.4 +/- 1.32% and decreased to 7.4 +/- 0.6% during therapy with rosiglitazone. This case demonstrates the benefits of PPARgamma-agonists on glycaemic control and dyslipidaemia in a patient with FPLD. This in turn implies that PPARgamma may play a pathophysiological role in FPLD.
The PET H2 15O-bolus method was used to image regional brain activity in normal human subjects during intense pain induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin and during post-capsaicin mechanical allodynia (the perception of pain from a normally non-painful stimulus). Images of regional cerebral blood flow were acquired during six conditions: (i) rest; (ii) light brushing of the forearm; (iii) forearm intradermal injection of capsaicin, (iv) and (v) the waning phases of capsaicin pain; and (vi) allodynia. Allodynia was produced by light brushing adjacent to the capsaicin injection site after ongoing pain from the capsaicin injection had completely subsided. Capsaicin treatment produced activation in many discrete brain regions which we classified as subserving four main functions: sensation-perception (primary somatosensory cortex, thalamus and insula); attention (anterior cingulate cortex); descending pain control (periaqueductal grey); and an extensive network related to sensory-motor integration (supplementary motor cortex, bilateral putamen and insula, anterior lobe and vermis of the cerebellum and superior colliculus). Comparison of the noxious and non-noxious stimuli yielded several new insights into neural organization of pain and tactile sensations. Capsaicin pain, which had no concomitant tactile component, produced little or no activation in secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), whereas light brushing produced a prominent activation of SII, suggesting a differential sensitivity of SII to tactile versus painful stimuli. The cerebellar vermis was strongly activated by capsaicin, whereas light brush and experimental allodynia produced little or no activation, suggesting a selective association with C-fibre stimulation and nociceptive second-order spinal neurons. The experimental allodynia activated a network that partially overlapped those activated by both pain and light brush alone. Unlike capsaicin-induced pain, allodynia was characterized by bilateral activation of inferior prefrontal cortex, suggesting that prefrontal responses to pain are context dependent.
Stimulant-induced psychosis and addiction are most commonly associated with a pattern of repeated high dose 'binge' exposures, preceded by progressively escalating doses (ED). We have recently reported that an ED/multiple binge treatment with amphetamine or methamphetamine results in a unique behavioral profile, characterized by a differential change in the relative expression of locomotion and stereotypy and the emergence of a bursting pattern of ambulation. To examine the generality of this behavioral profile, a similar regimen (ED, 2-15 mg/kg; binges, 15 mg/kg x 5 hourly injections x 15 days) was used to characterize the response to cocaine. Our results show that the primary characteristics of the behavioral profile previously found with the amphetamines were also apparent with cocaine. That is, the locomotor response was significantly greater, and was characterized by a bursting pattern. These observations lend further support to the notion that the progressive behavioral changes and the underlying neurochemical alterations produced by this treatment may be implicated in the addiction and psychosis which is associated with high dose stimulant abuse.
A 39-year old man developed purpura fulminans, a manifestation of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, with rhabdomyolsis following the i.m. injection of diclofenac.
A 76-year-old patient developed cutaneous vasculitis on the lower legs on the 8th day of treatment with the selective cox-2-inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex((R))) and the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole. The patient had no history of allergic reactions. The patient had already been treated previously with omeprazole without any side effects. A cutaneous biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The purpuric skin lesions regressed within 3 weeks after withdrawing the two newly introduced drugs. We discuss the potential role of Celecoxib in triggering this vasculitis.
Indomethacin purportedly arrests premature labor by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Animal experimentation has demonstrated that prostaglandins are involved in the neonatal rerouting of the circulation. Experience with two neonates with disorders circulatory adjustment at birth following prenatal exposure to indomethacin indicates that indomethacin may interfere with these adjustments in man and favor the development of the serious oxygen dependency known as primary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
Indomethacin is used to prolong gestation by inhibiting prostaglandin production, but hemodynamic consequences in the fetus are still in question. Prostaglandins E and F are involved in regulating vascular resistance in the ductus arteriosus and pulmonary vascular bed as demonstrated in animal experiments; in sheep and rats, indomethacin produced constriction of closure of the ductus arteriosus. A possible consequence to the newborn is primary pulmonary hypertension due to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Until more information can establish the metabolic, hematologic, and hemodynamic effects of indomethacin on the fetus and newborn, its use should be limited to centers where the newborn can be promptly treated.
Because Notch signaling is implicated in colon cancer tumorigenesis and protects cells from apoptosis by inducing prosurvival targets, it was hypothesized that inhibition of Notch signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) may enhance the chemosensitivity of colon cancer cells. We first show that the Notch-1 receptor, as well as its downstream target Hes-1, is up-regulated with colon cancer progression, similar to other genes involved in chemoresistance. We then report that chemotherapy induces Notch-1, as oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), or SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) induced Notch-1 intracellular domain (NICD) protein and activated Hes-1. Induction of NICD by oxaliplatin was caused by an increase in the activity and expression of gamma-secretase complex, as suppression of the protein subunit nicastrin with small interfering RNA (siRNA) prevented NICD induction after oxaliplatin. Subsequent inhibition of Notch-1 signaling with a sulfonamide GSI (GSI34) prevented the induction of NICD by chemotherapy and blunted Hes-1 activation. Blocking the activation of Notch signaling with GSI34 sensitized cells to chemotherapy and was synergistic with oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and SN-38. This chemosensitization was mediated by Notch-1, as inhibition of Notch-1 with siRNA enhanced chemosensitivity whereas overexpression of NICD increased chemoresistance. Down-regulation of Notch signaling also prevented the induction of prosurvival pathways, most notably phosphoinositide kinase-3/Akt, after oxaliplatin. In summary, colon cancer cells may up-regulate Notch-1 as a protective mechanism in response to chemotherapy. Therefore, combining GSIs with chemotherapy may represent a novel approach for treating metastatic colon cancers by mitigating the development of chemoresistance.
Immune cell airway infiltration and the bronchovascular remodeling process have shown to be promising in the understanding of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) pathogenesis. In this study we sought to validate the importance of immune cells, whether diffusely distributed or forming lymphoid follicles, collagen density, and vascular factors. Eight weeks after a single nitric acid (NA) nasal instillation, lung changes were characterized by lumen distortion, epithelial layer folding, reduction or total obliteration of terminal bronchiole (TB) lumen, and wall thickness increase. The morphologic changes in the TB and TA (terminal artery) lumen coincide with the measurement difference in the three groups. The TB diameter and lumen were significantly decreased in BO when compared with non-BO lungs (0.76 +/- 0.05 microm vs. 0.81 +/- 0.05 microm and 12,286.13 +/- 378.83 microm vs. 18,182.27 +/- 5,593.98 microm, p = 0.05 and p = 0.01, respectively). Equally significant was the increase in TB thickness in BO when compared with the non-BO group (201.72 +/- 35.75 microm vs. 149.75 +/- 40.61 microm, p = 0.007). The morphologic changes in immune cells seen in TB, TA, and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) also coincide with the quantification differences observed in the three groups. We concluded that immune cell infiltration and collagen/vascular remodeling are related to the spectrum of histologic changes in a BO nasal-induced model in mice and may be an appropriate target for prospective studies of human bronchiolitis.
Calcium channel blocker (CCB) overdose is associated with dysrhythmias and atrioventricular (AV) block, however, experience with infant CCB overdose is limited. A 9-month-old girl was found playing with tablets of extended-release diltiazem 120 mg. The patient had two episodes of emesis, which contained pill fragments, and was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) 4.5 h after being found. Vital signs were: rectal temperature 37.1 degrees C, pulse 87 beats/min, respiratory rate 30-40 breaths/min, blood pressure 72/48 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) 99% on room air. Otherwise, the patient was well-appearing, with normal skin color and examination. The electrocardiogram revealed third-degree atrioventricular block with a ventricular rate of 90 beats/min, QRS 68 ms, and QTc 411 ms. Atropine 0.1 mg i.v. was given, which increased the heart rate to 100-110 beats/min. Calcium gluconate 500 mg was also given intravenously. Laboratory evaluation revealed bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, anion gap 16, and glucose 129 mg/dL. On hospital day 1, the patient was noted to have a junctional rhythm with a rate of 90-100, and systolic blood pressure of 80-90 mm Hg. No additional medications were given. Early on day 2, the patient converted spontaneously to a normal sinus rhythm and was discharged approximately 42 h after presentation to the ED. In addition to bradycardia and hypotension, this 9-month-old patient manifested third-degree AV block after ingesting extended-release diltiazem.
Persistent down-regulation in the expression of the hyperpolarization-activated HCN1 cation channel, a key determinant of intrinsic neuronal excitability, has been observed in febrile seizure, temporal lobe epilepsy, and generalized epilepsy animal models, as well as in patients with epilepsy. However, the role and importance of HCN1 down-regulation for seizure activity is unclear. To address this question we determined the susceptibility of mice with either a general or forebrain-restricted deletion of HCN1 to limbic seizure induction by amygdala kindling or pilocarpine administration. Loss of HCN1 expression in both mouse lines is associated with higher seizure severity and higher seizure-related mortality, independent of the seizure-induction method used. Therefore, down-regulation of HCN1 associated with human epilepsy and rodent models may be a contributing factor in seizure behavior.
Early studies have suggested that increasing doses of anthracycline improve outcome in younger patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but dose escalation has been precluded by the acute and chronic toxicities of these agents. Amifostine is a cytoprotective compound that has been shown to protect against the acute cytotoxicities of anthracyclines in animal models. We report the results of a phase I study of dose escalation of idarubicin with amifostine and high-dose ara-C in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
The continuous reassessment method was used to predict the probability of toxicity.
Five patients were treated at an idarubicin dose of 18 mg/m2/day x 3, three of whom developed grade 3 diarrhea or mucositis. Subsequently, three additional patients were treated at a dose of 15 mg/m2 x 3 days, all of whom experienced grade 3 diarrhea or mucositis. One patient achieved complete remission (CR rate 12.5%, 95% CI 0-0.52%).
The addition of amifostine does not allow dose escalation of idarubicin when combined with high-dose ara-C.
The study was to explore the potential immunoregulatory mechanisms linking fine particles and cardiac injury. Wistar kyoto (WKY) rats were exposed by intratracheal instillation to fine particles with the doses of 0.0, 1.6, 8.0 and 40.0mg/kg b.w., respectively. The exposure was conducted once a day, for three consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last exposure, the rats were sacrificed. Th1- and Th2-related transcription factors and cytokines were assessed in left ventricle of rats. The mRNA expressions of Th1- and Th2-related transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcriptionl 1 (STAT1), signal transducer and activator of transcriptional 6 (STAT6), GATA-3 and T-bet were assessed in left ventricle of rats using real-time PCR. Meanwhile, the levels of Th1- and Th2-related cytokines IL-4, IL-13 and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) were determined by ELISA kits in cardiac homogenate supernatant of rats. Furthermore, the protein expression of IL-4 and IFN-γ were detected in myocardium by Western blot. The results of cardiac histology demonstrated exacerbated cardiac lesions and histological characterization of inflammation and degeneration in rats after exposure to fine particles. Moreover, fine particles induced significant increase of IL-4 and IL-13 and decrease of IFN-γ in myocardium of rats. The mRNA expression of STAT1, STAT6 and GATA-3 were up-regulated in left ventricle of rats in a dose-dependent manner, whereas T-bet was significantly down-regulated. The variations of these cytokines demonstrated the imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines existed in cardiac injuries induced by fine particle. The imbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokines might be one of the mechanisms of immunotoxicity of cardiovascular system induced by ambient fine particles.
Oral administration of the chloroform extract from Tanacetum larvatum (Griseb. ex Pant.) Kanitz caused a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in the carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema test. The obtained anti-inflammatory effect was 8.6, 32.8, 37.0 and 49.5% for the extract doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200mg/kg, respectively, being statistically significant at a dose of 50mg/kg. Indomethacin had a strong anti-inflammatory effect of 73.4% at a dose of 8mg/kg, but large gastric lesions were detected. When the plant extract in the highest tested dose (200mg/kg) was concomitantly given with indomethacin, the anti-inflammatory effect was slightly enhanced, but the gastric lesions were significantly reduced. The anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer activity may be mainly due to the inhibition of DNA binding of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by components of the plant extract. This was proven in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay at a concentration of 50microg/ml. Due to its anti-inflammatory as well as anti-ulcer effects, Tanacetum larvatum should especially be used combined with those drugs that are known both for their strong anti-inflammatory activities and the ulcerogenic side effects such as NSAIDs.
This study attempted to quantify an achievable removal rate of subdermal levonorgestrel implants (SLIs) in an unselected population and develop strategies for increasing continuation. Over 16 months, 1,076 SLIs were inserted in eligible patients from a lower socioeconomic group at high risk for unintended pregnancy. Extensive preinsertion and postinsertion counseling and follow-up care were given. Patients developing problems were counseled and managed conservatively. If a patient requested removal of the Norplant after this process, removal was done. Twenty-two removals occurred due to SLI-related problems, for a rate of 2.04%; no trends based on age or parity were found. The most common reasons for removal were bleeding/irregular menses (31.8%), headaches (18.1%) and hair loss (13.6%). An episode of thrombophlebitis, not thought to be caused by the SLI, led to one removal. Seventy-seven percent of removals occurred in the first six months, with peak rates in the fourth and fifth. Five patients became pregnant inadvertently within six months of removal. An extremely low removal rate and high continuation rate are possible in an inner city clinic population at risk for unintended pregnancy. Acceptance will increase if the SLI can be maintained at least past six months. Extensive counseling, patient support and conservative medical management constitute a successful approach.
In this study we investigated the effect of the antiulcer agent, sulglycotide, on the activity of a key pro-apoptotic protease, caspase-3, and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS-2) associated with gastric epithelial cell apoptosis triggered by the enhancement in tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) during indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal injury.
The experiments were conducted with rats pretreated intragastrically with sulglycotide (200 mg/kg) or vehicle, followed 30 min later by an intragastric dose of indomethacin (60 mg/kg). The animals were killed 2 h later and their mucosal tissue used for macroscopic assessment, assays of epithelial cell apoptosis and TNF-alpha, and the measurement of caspase-3 and NOS-2 activities.
In the absence of sulglycotide, indomethacin caused multiple haemorrhagic lesions accompanied by a 20-fold enhancement in gastric epithelial cell apoptosis and a 47% increase in mucosal expression of TNF-alpha, while NOS-2 showed an 11.9-fold induction and the activity of caspase-3 increased 3.9-fold. Pretreatment with sulglycotide produced a 51.2% reduction in the extent of mucosal damage caused by indomethacin, a 43.9% decrease in the epithelial cell apoptosis and a 39.7% reduction in TNF-alpha, while the activity of caspase-3 decreased by 58.8% and that of NOS-2 showed a 47.3% decline.
Our findings implicate the enhanced expression of caspase-3 and NOS-2 in the process of death signalling cascade associated with indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal injury, and show that sulglycotide is capable of suppressing the pathway of apoptotic events propagated by TNF-alpha, NOS-2 and caspase-3.
Antineoplastons are naturally occurring cytodifferentiating agents. Chemically, antineoplastons are medium and small sized peptides, amino acid derivatives and organic acids which exist in blood, tissues and urine. In clinical trials in advanced cancer, in addition to the anticancer activity it was observed that patients suffering from both cancer and Parkinson's disease exhibited marked improvement in parkinsonian symtomatology when treated with antineoplaston A5. The present study was designed to analyse the influence of A5 on central dopaminergic structures. Mice and rats were given A5 intraperitoneally at three different dosage levels. Experiments conducted included spontaneous locomotor activity, amphetamine-induced yawning and erections, catalepsy, the effect on the level and utilization of noradrenaline and dopamine in the brain and the influence of prolonged and chronic treatment on the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. It has been demonstrated that A5 stimulates the central dopaminergic receptors. It diminishes the cataleptic response to haloperidol and enhances the incidence of apomorphine-induced yawning. Biochemical studies demonstrated increased concentration of dopamine and noradrenaline in the brain and diminished utilization of both catecholamines.
A 45-year-old man with the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and CNS toxoplasmosis presented with acute renal failure, hematuria, and renal colic shortly after starting treatment with sulfadiazine. Ultrasound examination of his kidneys was suggestive of intraparenchymal crystallization of sulfadiazine. His renal failure and ultrasound findings rapidly resolved with alkaline hydration. On rechallenge with sulfadiazine, he again developed renal insufficiency and ultrasonic findings consistent with stones. The use of sulfadiazine in the treatment of CNS toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients should be monitored carefully with the recognition that this form of crystalline-induced acute renal failure can occur in a dehydrated patient.
The objective of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of tramadol/acetaminophen (APAP) (total dose 75 mg/650 mg) and tramadol (total dose 100 mg) for the control of pain after oral surgery. A total of 456 patients with moderate-to-severe pain within 5 h after extraction of two or more third molars were randomized to receive two identical encapsulated tablets containing tramadol/APAP 37.5 mg/325 mg, tramadol 50 mg, or placebo. Tramadol/APAP was superior to tramadol (P < 0.001) or placebo (P < 0.001) on all efficacy measures: total pain relief (PAR) over 6 h (7.4, 2.5, and 1.5, respectively, on a scale of 0-24); sum of pain intensity differences (PIDs) (3.1, 0.6, and 0.1, respectively, on a scale of -6 to 18); and sum of PAR and PID (10.5, 3.1, and 1.6, respectively, on a scale of -6 to 42). Median times to onset of perceptible and meaningful PAR were 37.6 and 126.5 min, respectively, for the tramadol/APAP group (P < 0.001) for each, compared with tramadol and placebo arms). The most common adverse events with active treatment were nausea, dizziness, and vomiting; these events occurred more frequently in the tramadol group than in the tramadol/APAP group. This study established the superiority of tramadol/APAP 75 mg/650 mg over tramadol 100 mg in the treatment of acute pain following oral surgery.
