From a hospital-based surveillance carried out in Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India, the socio-economic, demographic and treatment response information of 737 patients admitted with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) during January 2001-December 2003, were analysed. The disease was two times higher in males than in females because of several factors including clothing pattern, sleeping habits and occupation. In Bihar, the second poorest state in India, poverty plays a major role in perpetuation of the disease, contributing to malnutrition, illiteracy (60%), and poor housing (82%). Further, presences of peri-domestic animal shelters around houses (63%) and vegetations (77%) facilitate breeding of sand fly vector. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar in the age groups <12 years and >12 years. The increasing unresponsiveness of VL patients to conventional anti-leishmanial drugs, e.g. sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) and pentamidine, has definitely posed a major therapeutic challenge in combating the disease. Amphotericin B, though costly, is highly effective. Miltefosine is a highly promising new oral drug for VL.
Cocaine abstinence is associated with impaired performance in cognitive functions including attention, vigilance and executive function. Here we test the hypothesis that cognitive dysfunction during cocaine abstinence reflects in part impairment of cortical and subcortical regions modulated by dopamine. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain activation to a verbal working memory task in cocaine abusers (n=16) and healthy controls (n=16). Compared to controls, cocaine abusers showed: (1) hypoactivation in the mesencephalon, where dopamine neurons are located, as well as the thalamus, a brain region involved in arousal; (2) larger deactivation in dopamine projection regions (putamen, anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala); and (3) hyperactivation in cortical regions involved with attention (prefrontal and parietal cortices), which probably reflects increased attention and control processes as compensatory mechanisms. Furthermore, the working memory load activation was lower in the prefrontal and parietal cortices in cocaine abusers when compared with controls, which might reflect limited network capacity. These abnormalities were accentuated in the cocaine abusers with positive urines for cocaine at time of study (as compared to cocaine abusers with negative urines) suggesting that the deficits may reflect in part early cocaine abstinence. These findings provide evidence of impaired function of regions involved with executive control, attention and vigilance in cocaine abusers. This widespread neurofunctional disruption is likely to underlie the cognitive deficits during early cocaine abstinence and to reflect involvement of dopamine as well as other neurotransmitters.
Fifteen patients with metastatic mixed mesodermal sarcoma of the uterus received high dose doxorubicin infusion therapy. For 12 patients, the initial dose was 90 mg/m2; the other three patients' starting doses were 50, 75, and 75 mg/m2 respectively. Twelve patients received doxorubicin as firstline chemotherapy, with a cumulative dose of 90 mg/m2 to 675 mg/m2 (median = 495 mg/m2). Three patients treated secondarily received cumulative doses of 90, 205, and 425 mg/m2. Of nine patients who had measurable disease, none had an objective response. The median survival of the 15 patients was 11.3 months, with a range of 0.5 to 51+ months. Two patients died of neutropenia related sepsis. Cardiotoxicity occurred in two patients. Eleven patients are dead of disease, and two patients are alive without evidence of disease at 49, and 51 months. Extending the doxorubicin dosage to its tolerable limits did not appear to result in improved efficacy in patients with metastatic mixed mesodermal uterine sarcomas. Future clinical trials should concentrate on doxorubicin-containing combination regimens and Phase II single agent studies.
We report three new cases of bladder cancer occurring in patients treated by cyclophosphamide (Endoxan): two patients had Waldenstr√∂m disease and were treated during 7.5 and 7 years respectively (total received dose of 220 and 190 g respectively). The third patient was treated for autoimmune erythroblastopenia and the bladder cancer occurred 5 years after treatment by cyclophosphamide (39 g during 3.3 years). Bladder cancers after cyclophosphamide treatment are generally transitional cell carcinomas. They are observed after an oral treatment, generally given for more than one year. A cumulative dose of more than 20 g is the principal risk factor, with a median interval from treatment to tumor of 7 years. No other risk factor has been identified (tobacco, age, sex, hemorrhagic cystitis). The relative risk of bladder cancer is estimated between 7 and 9, and seems proportional to the cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide. The first hypothesis to explain bladder cancer occurrence is a carcinogenic effect of one of the cyclophosphamide metabolites, acrolein, but the immunosuppressive effect of cyclophosphamide may play a role. The risk of secondary bladder cancer implies to limit the use of cyclophosphamide, particularly in non malignant disease, and to closely watch the patient especially by way of annual cystoscopy.
Leishmaniasis is a common parasitic disease in Southern Europe, caused by Leishmania infantum. The failures of current treatment with pentavalent antimonials are partially attributable to the emergence of antimony-resistant Leishmania strains. This study analyses the in vitro susceptibility to pentavalent antimony of intracellular amastigotes from a range of L. infantum strains, derived from the same infected animal, during in vitro and in vivo passages and after host treatment with meglumine antimoniate.
SbV-IC50 values for strains from two distinct isolates from the same host and one stock after two years of culture in NNN medium and posterior passage to hamster were similar (5.0 +/- 0.2; 4.9 +/- 0.2 and 4.4 +/- 0.1 mgSbV/L, respectively). In contrast, a significant difference (P < 0.01, t test) was observed between the mean SbV-IC50 values in the stocks obtained before and after treatment of hosts with meglumine antimoniate (4.7 +/- 0.4 mgSbV/L vs. 7.7 +/- 1.5 mgSbV/L). Drug-resistance after drug pressure in experimentally infected dogs increased over repeated drug administration (6.4 +/- 0.5 mgSbV/L after first treatment vs. 8.6 +/- 1.4 mgSbV/L after the second) (P < 0.01, t test).
These results confirm previous observations on strains from Leishmania/HIV co-infected patients and indicate the effect of the increasing use of antimony derivatives for treatment of canine leishmaniasis in endemic areas on the emergence of Leishmania antimony-resistant strains.
Cutaneous mycoses such as tinea capitis, onychomycosis and some cases of tinea corporis/cruris, and tinea pedis/manus require oral antifungal therapy. There is relatively limited data regarding the use of the newer oral antifungal agents, e.g. itraconazole, in the treatment of these mycoses in children.
We wished to determine the efficacy and safety of itraconazole continuous therapy in the management of cutaneous fungal infections in children.
Children with cutaneous mycoses were treated with itraconazole in an open-label manner in 4 studies. For tinea capitis, the treatment regimens using itraconazole continuous therapy were: study 1, 3 mg/kg/day for 4 or 8 weeks; study 2, 5 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks, and study 3, 5 mg/kg/ day for 4 weeks. In a different trial, study 4, itraconazole continuous therapy 5 mg/kg/day was used to treat toenail onychomycosis (duration: 12 weeks), tinea corporis/ cruris (duration: 1 week) and tinea pedis/manus (duration: 2 weeks).
The efficacy rates at follow-up 12 weeks from the start of therapy in children with tinea capitis treated using the itraconazole continuous regimen were: clinical cure (CC) and mycological cure (MC) in study 1 (n = 10, Trichophyton violaceum all patients), CC 50%, MC 86%; in study 2 (n = 35, Microsporum canis 22 patients, Trichophyton sp. 12 patients), CC 82.8%, MC 80%, and in study 3 (n = 16, M. canis 11 patients, Trichophyton sp. 5 patients), (CC 66.7%, MC 78.5%. Itraconazole was also effective in the treatment of dermatomycoses in 24 children (study 4). The CC and MC rates at the follow-up 8 weeks from the start of therapy in children with dermatomycoses and 12 months in children treated for onychomycosis were: onychomycosis (n = 1, T. rubrum), CC 100%, MC 100%; tinea corporis (n = 12, M. canis 10 patients), CC 100%, MC 90%; tinea cruris (n = 3, Trichophyton sp. 2 patients), CC 100%, MC 100%; tinea manus (n = 1, T. rubrum), CC 100%, MC 100%, and tinea pedis (n = 7, T. rubrum), CC 100%, MC 100%). Adverse effects consisted of a cutaneous eruption in 1 (1.2%) of the 85 children, with mild, transient, asymptomatic elevation of liver function tests (less than twice the upper limit of normal) in 2 (3.4%) of 58 children in whom monitoring was performed.
Itraconazole is effective and safe in the treatment of tinea capitis and other cutaneous fungal infections in children.
Cyclosporin A (CsA) is a potent immunosuppressant that has many side effects, including hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia, and tremor. To evaluate whether there is a relationship between the CsA-pharmacokinetics (PK) and these side effects, their presence and intensity were observed in 46 renal transplanted children/adolescents during two regular visits, and the occurrence of the side effects was correlated with CsA-PK. CsA doses had been unchanged for at least 6 mo. CsA blood concentrations were measured at time 0, and 1, 2, and 4 h after the CsA morning dose. An abbreviated area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using C0, C2, and C4. Hypertrichosis positively correlated with C2, C4, Cmax, and AUC. An AUC > or = 4158 ng/ml per h was the best predictor for the presence of hypertrichosis. Tremor was also positively correlated with C2, Cmax, and AUC. A Cmax > or = 878 ng/ml was the best predictor for the appearance of tremor. These values of Cmax and AUC are within the therapeutic range of CsA as demonstrated by the studies of calcineurin inhibition by CsA. Gingival hyperplasia was not associated with any of the CsA-PK studied parameters. However, it was associated with the concomitant use of nifedipine. These data show that there is a correlation between the CsA side effects and its pharmacokinetics and that it is possible to decrease the incidence and intensity of such side effects by monitoring the CsA-PK parameters, providing they are under or at the proposed cutoff levels. Nifedipine should also be avoided to reduce the presence of gingival hyperplasia.
Phosphorylase kinase (PHK) is a key enzyme in the control of glycogen breakdown. Several types of PHK deficiency have been described of which X-linked liver glycogenosis type I (XLG I) is the most common. Since the XLG I locus and the gene encoding the liver alpha-subunit gene of PHK (PHKA2) have both been localized to Xp22, PHKA2 was a candidate gene for XLG I. In this study we identified four point mutations in four unrelated XLG I patients: three mutations introduce a premature stop codon, whereas the fourth mutation abolishes a splice site consensus sequence leading to exon skipping. These findings indicate that PHKA2 is the XLG I gene.
Oxidative stress is implicated in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The Nrf2-antioxidant response element pathway protects cells from oxidative stress. Studies have shown that global Nrf2 deficiency hastens the progression of NASH. The purpose of this study was to determine whether long-term hepatocyte-specific activation of Nrf2 mitigates NASH progression. Transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active Nrf2 construct in hepatocytes (AlbCre+/caNrf2+) and littermate controls were generated. These mice were fed standard or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet, a diet used to induce NASH development in rodents. After 28 days of MCD dietary feeding, mice developed significant increases in steatosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and HSC activation compared with those mice on standard diet. AlbCre+/caNrf2+ animals had significantly decreased serum transaminases and reduced steatosis when compared with the AlbCre+/caNrf2- animals. This significant reduction in steatosis was associated with increased expression of genes involved in triglyceride export (MTTP) and Œ≤-oxidation (CPT2). However, there were no differences in the increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and HSC activation from MCD diet administration between the AlbCre+/caNrf2- and AlbCre+/caNrf2+ animals. We conclude that hepatocyte-specific activation of Nrf2-mediated gene expression decreased hepatocellular damage and steatosis in a dietary model of NASH. However, hepatocyte-specific induction of Nrf2-mediated gene expression alone is insufficient to mitigate inflammation, oxidative stress, and HSC activation in this nutritional NASH model.
In a platelet/endothelial biomarker substudy of the Sertraline AntiDepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial (SADHART), the authors sought to determine whether plasma levels of sertraline and its primary metabolite N-desmethylsertraline affect the release of platelet/endothelial biomarkers.
Fifty-five acute coronary syndrome patients with depression were randomly assigned to receive sertraline (N=23) or placebo (N=32). Twenty-six serial plasma samples collected at week 6 (N=12) and week 16 (N=14) were analyzed. Platelet factor 4 (PF4), beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1), P-selectin, thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)), prostacyclin (6-keto-PGF1alpha), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Concentrations of sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline were determined by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection in autologous samples.
Strong, mostly time-dependent negative correlations were found for the plasma levels of sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline with PF4 (week 6: r=-0.69 and -0.33, respectively; week 16: r=-0.63 for both), beta-TG (week 6: r=-0.43 and -0.29; week 16: r=-0.66 and -0.57), PECAM-1 (week 6: r=-0.82 and -0.49; week 16: r=-0.60 for both), P-selectin (week 6: r=-0.82 and -0.49; week 16: r=-0.73 and -0.43), and TxB(2) (week 6: r=-0.66 and -0.59; and week 16: r=-0.64 and -0.41). Regression analysis revealed some borderline correlations for endothelial markers such as 6-keto- PGF1alpha and E-selectin and a positive correlation for VCAM-1.
This is the first documented evidence that plasma release of platelet/endothelial biomarkers is directly related to the levels of sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline in acute coronary syndrome patients receiving SSRI treatment for depression. The clinical significance of these findings should be assessed in the setting of a randomized clinical trial.
Cynandione A, an acetophenone from the roots of Cynanchum auriculatum and other species in the genus attenuates neurotoxicity of a variety of neurotoxic agents such as l-glutamate in vitro. In this study, we sought to further characterize the neuroprotective effects of cynandione A and other acetophenones from the roots of C. auriculatum in pheochromocytoma tumor cell line PC12 and investigate whether cynandione A protected against ischemic injuries in rats with experimentally induced cerebral ischemia. Viability assays using the 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophen-yl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt method and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays showed that cynandione A dose-dependently attenuated glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. Comparative proteomic analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight MS/MS of PC12 cells treated with cynandione A showed 10 ŒºM cynandione A caused broad changes in protein expression in PC12 cells including down-regulation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and dihydropyrimidinase-like 2 (DPYSL2). Immunoblotting studies showed that 10 ŒºM cynandione A aborted glutamate-induced increase in DPYSL2 and HMGB1 levels in PC12 cells and 30 mg/kg cynandione A also attenuated the rise in HMGB1 levels and mitigated DPYSL2 cleavage in brain tissues of rats with cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, rats with cerebral ischemia treated with 30 mg/kg cynandione A exhibited markedly improved neurological deficit scores at 24 and 72 h compared with control and a 7.2% reduction in cerebral infarction size at 72 h (p < 0.05 vs. control). Our findings demonstrated that cynandione A mitigated ischemic injuries and should be further explored as a neuroprotective agent for ischemic stroke.
Paroxetine is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. In contrast to other SSRIs, it has a relatively short half-life and lacks active metabolites. In three patients the abrupt discontinuation of paroxetine seemed associated with sudden and impairing effects. All three reported marked sleep disturbances and dizziness. They were prescribed the drug for a minimum of 10 weeks, and the maximum dosage was 40 mg/day. All patients experienced rapid remission of symptoms after paroxetine was reintroduced. We failed to observe similar reactions from the abrupt discontinuation at lower dosages. Gradual tapering of the agent for patients receiving more than 20 mg/day is recommended.
The effect of exogenously administered manganese (Mn) on developmental neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was examined in male mice after maternal exposure to MnCl(2) (0, 32, 160, or 800 ppm as Mn in diet) from gestational day 10 to day 21 after delivery on weaning. Immunohistochemistry was performed to monitor neurogenesis and interneuron subpopulations on postnatal days (PNDs) 21 and 77 (adult stage). Reelin-synthesizing Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons increased in the hilus with ‚â• 160 ppm on weaning to sustain to PND 77 at 800 ppm. Apoptosis in the neuroblast-producing subgranular zone increased with 800 ppm and TUC4-expressing immature granule cells decreased with 800 ppm on weaning, whereas at the adult stage, immature granule cells increased. On PND 21, transcript levels increased with Reln and its receptor gene Lrp8 and decreased with Dpysl3 coding TUC4 in the dentate gyrus, confirming immunohistochemical results. Double immunohistochemistry revealed a sustained increase of reelin-expressing and NeuN-lacking or weakly positive immature interneurons and NeuN-expressing mature neurons in the hilus through to the adult stage as examined at 800 ppm. Brain Mn concentrations increased at both PNDs 21 and 77 in all MnCl(2)-exposed groups. These results suggest that Mn targets immature granule cells causing apoptosis and neuronal mismigration. Sustained increases in immature reelin-synthesizing GABAergic interneurons may represent continued aberration in neurogenesis and following migration to cause an excessive response for overproduction of immature granule cells through to the adult stage. Sustained high concentration of Mn in the brain may be responsible for these changes.
Three cases of heparin induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia are reported. Pathogenesis, clinical and biological manifestations as well as treatment are reviewed. Treatment consisted in replacing the heparin by a vitamin K antagonist or a low molecular weight heparin. During heparin treatment, the risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenia should be kept in mind and the platelet count monitored from time to time.
To isolate and identify the Diels-Alder type adducts from stem barks of Morus yunanensis.
The compounds were isolated and purified by silicagel, Sephadex LH-20 and RP-18 colum chromatography. Their chemical structures were elucidated on the basis ofphysicochemical properties and spectral data.
Nine compounds were isolated and identified as: kuwanon G (1), sanggenol M (2), mulberrofuran J (3), guangsangon B (4), resveratrol (5), kuwanon X (6), kuwanon P (7), mulberrofuran O (8), mulberrofuran Q (9).
All the compounds are isolated from the plant for the first time, and compounds 4, 5 have anti-inflammation activities with inhibitory ratios of 57.3%, 50.5% respectively at a concentration of 10 microg mL(-1).
Lipid metabolism in chylomicron and VLDL were examined in daunomycin-induced nephrotic rats. 1) There was no difference in intestinal cholesterogenesis between the control rats and daunomycin-induced nephrotic rats. 2) The apoprotein content of chylomicron and VLDL increased in daunomycin-induced nephrotic rats. 3) Daunomycin-induced nephrotic rats showed increases in the content of apo B-48 and C-III, and a decrease in that of apo E in chylomicron. The apoprotein composition of VLDL in daunomycin-induced nephrotic rats showed increased apo B and decreased apo E. These results suggest that increased chylomicron-cholesterol is not due to increased intestinal cholesterogenesis, but to decreased chylomicron catabolism in daunomycin-induced nephrotic rats. Increased apoprotein in VLDL may contribute to the decreased catabolism by reducing LPL activity in the plasma and increased secretion from the liver of daunomycin induced nephrotic rats.
Carboplatin is effective in the treatment of malignant brain tumors. However, when administered in conjunction with osmotic opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), carboplatin is ototoxic. The purpose of this study was to determine whether delayed administration of sodium thiosulfate (STS), given after BBB closure, provided protection against carboplatin ototoxicity. Patients underwent monthly treatment with intra-arterial carboplatin (200 mg/m2/day x 2) in conjunction with osmotic opening of the BBB, for up to 1 year. Audiological assessment was conducted at baseline and within 24 h before each monthly treatment. STS was administered i.v. as one (20 g/m2) or two (20 g/m2 and 16 g/m2) 15-min doses, depending on baseline hearing status. The initial group received the first STS dose 2 h (or 2 and 6 h) after carboplatin (STS2) and a subsequent group received STS 4 h (or 4 and 8 h) after carboplatin (STS4). Audiological data were compared with a historical comparison group (HCG) treated with carboplatin without STS. Spearman correlation coefficients comparing STS 2 (n = 24), STS4 (n = 17), and HCG (n = 19) indicated significantly lower rates of ototoxicity with increased delay in STS (P = 0.0006). On the basis of the analysis of hearing levels, there were significant differences among the two STS groups and HCG at 8000 Hz (P = 0.0010) and at 4000 Hz (P = 0.0075). The log-rank test for time to ototoxicity indicated a significant difference between STS4 and HCG (P = 0.0018). Delayed STS was effective in protecting against carboplatin-induced hearing loss. STS delayed to 4 h after carboplatin significantly decreased time to development of ototoxicity and rate of ototoxicity when compared with HCG.
The role of phospholipase on the mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy was investigated in the heart mitochondria of Wistar rats. In the in vivo study, rats were divided into 3 groups: 1, the control group, untreated; 2, the doxorubicin 1-day group, in which doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) was injected s.c. once; and 3, the doxorubicin 4-day group, in which doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) was injected once a day for 4 consecutive days. In each group, the level of lipid peroxides and the phospholipase activity, the phospholipid content, and the enzymic activities in the respiratory chain were measured. The doxorubicin 4-day group showed significant increases of lipid peroxide level and phospholipase activity and an inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory function compared with the control group, while the doxorubicin 1-day group showed no significant difference. In the in vitro study, Experiment 1, intact rat heart mitochondria were incubated with 0.1 unit of phospholipase A2. After the incubation, the enzymic activities of the respiratory chain were disturbed in the same manner as in the in vivo experiment. In Experiment 2, rat heart mitochondria were incubated with ascorbate and ferrous sulfate. The experiment demonstrated the elevation of phospholipase activity associated with lipid peroxidation. These results suggested that the enhanced phospholipase activity caused by lipid peroxidation is responsible for the mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Suxamethonium has not yet been replaced to ease endotracheal intubation despite its many undesirable side effects. Hyperkalemia and muscle pain are two such side effects; they are not reliably prevented by giving, before suxamethonium, a small dose of a non depolarizing muscle relaxant, although it does decrease muscle fasciculations. The purpose of this study was to compare with a control group three different pretreatments of these undesirable effects of suxamethonium: 1) hyperventilation, 2) calcium chloride which are accepted means of lowering the serum potassium, and 3) magnesium sulfate which has been reported in a non-controlled study to decrease muscle fasciculations. The study was performed in 40 patients (10 per group) in whom changes of plasma potassium and calcium levels were determined and muscle fasciculations measured by an objective method. Serum electrolyte variations and the quantity and duration of muscle fasciculations were similar in all groups. None of the pretreatments administered had any adverse effect on the neuromuscular block induced by suxamethonium.
To further evaluate the role of tryptophan and vitamin B6 in bladder carcinogenesis, male Fischer 344 rats were fed 0.2% N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide (FANFT) in semipurified diet or were given semipurified diet alone for 4 weeks. One week later, rats from each group were assigned for the remainder of the experiment to one of four experimental diets, labeled as follows: group 1, control semipurified; group 2, L-tryptophan excess (2%); group 3, vitamin B6-deficient (1.0 mg/kg diet); or group 4, L-tryptophan excess, plus vitamin B6-deficient diet. All surviving rats were killed at 80 weeks of the experiment. Throughout the study, body weights were reduced in the groups fed FANFT and, at 70 and 80 weeks, body weights were reduced in the groups given tryptophan excess. The incidence of urinary bladder carcinoma was highest in the group treated with FANFT, followed by diet with control tryptophan and vitamin B6 levels (40%). The disease incidence was reduced in the vitamin B6-deficient group (13%) and of an intermediate range in the groups fed a tryptophan excess with or without vitamin B6 deficiency (28-29%). Tumors at other sites were greatest in number in FANFT-treated rats fed vitamin B6-deficient diet with excess tryptophan and were significantly fewer in FANFT-treated rats fed vitamin B6-deficient diet alone. Animals given diet deficient in vitamin B6 consistently had depressed levels of alanine aminotransferase activity and plasma pyridoxyl phosphate. FANFT pretreatment decreased alanine aminotransferase activities in rats in some groups and the feeding of tryptophan had variable effects on alanine aminotransferase and plasma pyridoxyl phosphate levels. Urinary tryptophan metabolites were influenced by all treatments, but the results did not correlate with tumor yields. Urinary bladder ornithine decarboxylase activity was not altered in vitamin B6-deficient female rats. These results do not support the hypothesis that increased dietary L-tryptophan promotes bladder carcinogenesis in rats, but other dietary factors might modify the process following FANFT initiation.
Recent studies have shown an association between the use of calcium channel antagonists for the treatment of hypertension and an increased risk of myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and cancer. The interpretation of the results of these studies and their application to clinical practice requires an understanding of study design constraints, conflicting results and limitations in extrapolating study findings to other dosage strengths, formulations or agents within the calcium channel antagonist class. A review and critique of these studies provides background information on the controversial subject of using calcium channel antagonists for the treatment of hypertension. Despite the limitations of these studies, clinicians may want to select other classes of agents, including diuretics and beta blockers, as first-line therapy until the morbidity and mortality effects related to the use of calcium channel antagonists are clearly known.
Up-regulation of HO-1 by genetic manipulation or pharmacological pre-treatment has been reported to provide benefits in several animal models of myocardial infarction (MI). However, its efficacy following MI initiation (as in clinical reality) remains to be tested. Therefore, this study investigated whether HO-1 over-expression, by cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) administered after LAD ligation, is still able to improve functional and structural changes in left ventricle (LV) in a rat model of 4-week MI.
A total of 144 adult male Wistar rats were subjected to either left anterior coronary artery ligation or sham-operation. The effect of CoPP treatment (5 mg/kg i.p. at the end of the surgical session and, then, once a week for 4 weeks) was evaluated on the basis of survival, electro- and echocardiography, plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), endothelin-1 and prostaglandin E2, coronary microvascular reactivity, MI size, LV wall thickness and vascularity. Besides, the expression of HO-1 and connexin-43 in different LV territories was assessed by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, respectively.
CoPP induced an increased expression of HO-1 protein with >16 h delay. CoPP treatment significantly reduced mortality, MI size, BNP concentration, ECG alterations, LV dysfunction, microvascular constriction, capillary rarefaction and restored connexin-43 expression as compared to untreated MI. These functional and structural changes were paralleled by increased HO-1 expression in all LV territories. HO activity inhibition by tin-mesoporphyrin abolished the differences between CoPP-treated and untreated MI animals.
This is the first report demonstrating the putative role of pharmacological induction of HO-1 following coronary occlusion to benefit infarcted and remote territories, leading to better cardiac function in a 4-week MI outcome.
Among the antihypertensives currently in use, the sympatholytic drugs (e.g., central alpha-agonists, beta-blockers) and diuretics are most commonly associated with sexual side effects. Previous reports of sexual dysfunction associated with these drugs have been based entirely on retrospective and self-report data. This is the first study to date to investigate beta-blocker effects on sexual function by means of physiological (NPT), subjective, and hormonal measures. Four beta-blockers with different ancillary properties (atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol, propranolol) were evaluated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, Latin-square design. Thirty healthy male volunteers received, in counterbalanced order, each of the four drugs and 1 week of placebo testing. Significant drug effects on both total and free testosterone were found during treatment with all four beta-blockers, although it appeared that the nonselective drugs (pindolol, propranolol) were associated with the greatest reduction in testosterone. No significant effects were found on measures of cortisol or cholesterol. Analysis of NPT and self-report data yielded inconclusive results, perhaps due to the confounding effects of sleep disruption and the brief duration of treatment in this study. Inspection of individual records, however, suggested that some subjects may be especially vulnerable to sexual dysfunction in association with propranolol.
