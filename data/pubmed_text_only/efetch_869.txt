Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a highly malignant tumor, and identification of effective therapeutic targets to improve prognosis is urgently required. Oncogenic activation of survival genes is important for cancer cells to overcome oxidative stresses induced by their microenvironments that include chronic inflammation or exposure to anticancer drugs. We attempted to examine whether deregulation of Nrf2, a master transcriptional factor of various cytoprotective genes against oxidative stress, plays a role in the carcinogenesis of BTC.
We screened genetic alteration of Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, in BTC including tumors originated from gallbladder and extra- and intrahepatic bile ducts. Functional analysis of cancer-related mutant Keap1 in Nrf2 repression and the association between Nrf2 activation and resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were investigated.
Recurrent (in 1/11 cell lines and 6/53 primary tumors) Keap1 gene alterations were observed in BTC and were especially frequent (4/13, 30.7%) in gallbladder cancer (GBC). These alterations led to a considerable loss of Nrf2 repression activity, caused constitutive activation of Nrf2, and promoted cell proliferation. Down-regulation of Nrf2 activity by either Keap1 complementation or Nrf2 short interference RNA increased sensitivity to 5-FU in Keap1-altered BTC cells.
Keap1 mutation occurs frequently in GBC. Aberrant Nrf2 activation provoked by Keap1 alteration is one of the molecular mechanisms for chemotherapeutic resistance in GBC and will be a novel therapeutic target as an enhancer of sensitivity to 5-FU-based regimens.
To review reported cases of hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) associated with the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
A search of MEDLINE for reports of hyponatremia and SIADH associated with the use of fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine or sertraline published between January 1980 and May 1995. Unpublished reports of cases were requested from the pharmaceutical industry, the Ontario Medical Association, the Health Protection Branch of Health Canada, the US Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization.
Spontaneous reports from postmarketing surveillance.
A total of 736 cases of hyponatremia [corrected] and SIADH associated with SSRI use were reported. Fluoxetine was involved in 554 (75.3%) of the cases, paroxetine in 91 (12.4%), sertraline in 86 (11.7%) and fluvoxamine in 11 (1.5%). Reports of 30 cases were published. The remaining 706 cases were reported to monitoring bodies and the pharmaceutical industry. According to information in the published reports, the median time to onset of hyponatremia was 13 days (range 3 to 120 days). Most (83%) of the published cases involved patients 65 years of age or more, as compared with 74% of the unpublished cases.
Elderly people may be at increased risk for hyponatremia associated with SSRI use. Physicians caring for elderly patients should be aware of this potentially serious but reversible adverse effect. Further research is required to determine the incidence of this adverse effect, the relative risk of hyponatremia and SIADH in different age groups and the risk associated with different SSRI drugs.
Reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines contribute to cardiovascular diseases. Inhibition of downstream transcription factors and gene modifiers of these components are key mediators of hypertensive response. Histone acetylases/deacetylases can modulate the gene expression of these hypertrophic and hypertensive components. Therefore, we hypothesized that long-term inhibition of histone deacetylase with valproic acid might attenuate hypertrophic and hypertensive responses by modulating reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines in SHR rats. Seven-week-old SHR and WKY rats were used in this study. Following baseline blood pressure measurement, rats were administered valproic acid in drinking water (0.71% wt/vol) or vehicle, with pressure measured weekly thereafter. Another set of rats were treated with hydralazine (25 mg/kg per day orally) to determine the pressure-independent effects of HDAC inhibition on hypertension. Following 20 weeks of treatment, heart function was measured using echocardiography, rats were euthanized, and heart tissue was collected for measurement of total reactive oxygen species, as well as proinflammatory cytokine, cardiac hypertrophic, and oxidative stress gene and protein expressions. Blood pressure, proinflammatory cytokines, hypertrophic markers, and reactive oxygen species were increased in SHR versus WKY rats. These changes were decreased in valproic acid-treated SHR rats, whereas hydralazine treatment only reduced blood pressure. These data indicate that long-term histone deacetylase inhibition, independent of the blood pressure response, reduces hypertrophic, proinflammatory, and hypertensive responses by decreasing reactive oxygen species and angiotensin II type1 receptor expression in the heart, demonstrating the importance of uncontrolled histone deacetylase activity in hypertension.
Interspecific hybrid crosses between members of the fish genus Xiphophorus have been used for over 70 years to study the genetic aspects of melanoma formation. In the well-established "Gordon-Kosswig" cross, the platyfish X. maculatus is outcrossed to the swordtail X. helleri, and the resulting backcross segregants spontaneously develop melanoma. We recently produced a distinct cross between X. maculatus and another platyfish species, X. couchianus. X. maculatus strain Jp 163 A is homozygous for several X-linked pigment pattern genes, including the Spotted dorsal (Sd), Dorsal red (Dr), and Anal fin spot (Af). Af is a sex-limited trait, coding exclusively for melanophores distributed on the modified anal fin or "gonopodium" in the adult male fish. Within F1 and BC1 hybrids (to X. couchianus), the Sd pigment pattern is phenotypically suppressed, whereas Dr and Af are enhanced. We exposed BC1 hybrids to the direct-acting carcinogen N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Treatment led to the development of schwannomas, fibrosarcomas, and retinoblastomas. In addition, numerous MNU-treated males that inherited Af developed a pronounced melanotic phenotype, with melanin-containing cells oftentimes totally covering the gonopodium and extending further to grow within the ventral regions of the fish. Genetic linkage analysis of the BC1 hybrids revealed a significant (p < 0.01) association between CDKN2X genotype and the phenotypic degree of melanization. Such an association is consistent with a locus within linkage group V playing a role in the development of melanosis and delineates three genetic preconditions and a carcinogenic scheme resulting in melanosis of the ventral regions of hybrid fish. The overall study further alludes to the potential of using Xiphophorus fish to study carcinogenic mechanisms for tumors other than melanoma (schwannoma, fibrosarcoma, and retinoblastoma) and should enable extensive pathologic and molecular genetic studies of derived neoplastic abnormalities.
In a phase II study of vindesine in patients with bi-dimensionally measurable primary or metastatic prostate cancer, 27 patients (given 3 mg/m2 weekly for at least 4 treatment cycles) were evaluable for response 6 weeks from the start of treatment. Dose escalation to 4 mg/m2 weekly was attempted. Five patients (19%) achieved a partial remission of short duration, 11 patients (41%) showed no change and 11 patients (41%) showed progression. Thirty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity. Neurotoxicity occurred in 58% (severe in 23%) and was apparently cumulative dose-dependent, although there was variable individual sensitivity. Haematological toxicity was evidenced by lack of dose escalation in 32% of patients, dose delay in 71% and some degree of anaemia in 48%. Alopecia occurred in 55%. Other toxicities were few and minor. Vindesine shows marginal activity in prostatic cancer but at this dose schedule causes appreciable toxicity.
Arsenic, a potent environmental toxicant has been reported to induce diabetes mellitus, but its potential biological mechanism(s) has not been much investigated. The present study was designed to correlate pancreatic and hepatic oxidative stress with arsenic induced diabetes mellitus in experimental animals. Male albino Wistar rats were administered with low (1.5 mg kg(-1) b.wt.) and high (5.0 mg kg(-1) b.wt.) sodium arsenite orally for 4 week. Hyperglycemic condition was observed in arsenic exposed groups as indicated by increased (P < 0.001) fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which were accompanied by an increase in the level of lipid peroxidation (P < 0.001), protein oxidation (P < 0.05 at low dose and P < 0.001 at high dose) and nitric oxide (NO) (P < 0.001) in hepatic and pancreatic tissue compared to control. Furthermore, superoxide dismutase (SOD) (P < 0.001), catalase (CAT) (P < 0.001) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (P < 0.05 at low dose and P < 0.001 at high dose) activities were elevated, while glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (P < 0.05 at low dose and P < 0.001 at high dose) and GSH level showed significant (P < 0.001) depletion in both studied tissue of arsenic exposed rats compared to control. Arsenic induced hepatotoxicity was manifested by an increase (P < 0.001) in serum ALT, AST and ALP. Arsenic exposure leads to accumulation of arsenic (P < 0.05) and significant (P < 0.05) depletion of copper and zinc level in hepatic and pancreatic tissue as compared to control. Our data suggests that sub-chronic arsenic exposure induces diabetic condition which may be mediated due to increased oxidative stress in hepatic and pancreatic tissue.
In 120 premedicated patients undergoing general surgery, anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 3 mg kg-1, preceded by alfentanil 4.5, 9.0 or 13.5 micrograms kg-1 or fentanyl 1.5 micrograms kg-1. The largest alfentanil dose attenuated the arterial blood pressure response to laryngoscopy and intubation better than the smaller doses of alfentanil. Changes in frontal muscle electromyogram or plasma cortisol and prolactin levels were not dependent on the adjuvant used. After thiopentone, 30, 7 and 17% of the patients given alfentanil 9.0 and 13.5 micrograms kg-1 and fentanyl 1.5 micrograms kg-1, respectively, reacted to pinching of the lower abdomen. Patients given alfentanil 4.5 micrograms kg-1 did not tolerate the endotracheal tube after recovery from suxamethonium block and their heart rate was increased 12 min after alfentanil administration. We conclude that the antinociceptive effect of alfentanil is distinctly shorter than that of fentanyl. The analgesic potency of alfentanil is between one sixth and one ninth of that of fentanyl.
A case of fatal fulminant hepatitis following treatment with disulphiram in a man aged 34 year is reported. Acute toxic hepatitis produced by disulphiram is a rare but serious side effect with a lethality about 40%. In the case reported here, immediate withdrawal of disulphiram administration on the earliest signs of hepatitis did not prevent toxic development of severe hepatic necrosis.
Subthalamic nucleus high frequency stimulation (STN-HFS) efficiently alleviates L-DOPA-sensitive parkinsonian motor symptoms, but has no direct beneficial action on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID). Here, we provide evidence that anti-akinetic STN-HFS or dyskinesiogenic L-DOPA similarly reversed the dopamine lesion-induced increases in gene expression of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (CoI), a metabolic marker of neuronal activity, in the globus pallidus, STN and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in rats. In contrast, in entopeduncular nucleus (EP), STN-HFS did not modify the lesion-induced increase in CoI mRNA levels, whereas L-DOPA induced a marked decrease versus control. Combining the two treatments did not reveal significant interaction. Interestingly, CoI gene expression in EP but not in SNr was inversely correlated with striatal preprodynorphin mRNA level, a LID marker. This work suggests the existence of two functional basal ganglia subcircuits: the one, including STN and SNr, involved in antiparkinsonian action, and the other, including EP, preferentially involved in LID.
The gene for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa in a large pedigree of Irish origin has recently been found to be linked to an anonymous polymorphic sequence, D3S47 (C17), from the long arm of chromosome 3. As the gene coding for rhodopsin is also assigned to the long arm of chromosome 3 and is expressed in rod photoreceptors that are affected early in this blinding disease, we searched for a mutation of the rhodopsin gene in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. We found a C----A transversion in codon 23 (corresponding to a proline----histidine substitution) in 17 of 148 unrelated patients and not in any of 102 unaffected individuals. This result, coupled with the fact that the proline normally present at position 23 is highly conserved among the opsins and related G-protein receptors, indicates that this mutation could be the cause of one form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.
The concept of opioid-induced hyperalgesia has recently gained prominence as a contributing factor for long-term treatment failure.
To evaluate possible differences of opioids used in anaesthesia, cumulative doses of sufentanil and remifentanil were compared with escalating doses of the oripavine derivative etorphine, in awake and trained canines. This was followed by naloxone unmasking a possible hyperalgesic state, which had developed during opioid administration. Heart rate, blood pressure and propagation of nociceptive volleys in somatosensory-evoked potentials as well as the skin-twitch reflex were evaluated.
Opioid-related hypotension and bradycardia were reversed by naloxone with a late (30 min) overshoot of R43 and R17% after remifentanil and sufentanil, respectively. Following etorphine, overshoot in mean blood pressure was R9%, whereas heart rate still remained below S9% when compared with control. Peak hyperalgesia, as detected in the somatosensory-evoked potential and skin-twitch, increased by R70% after remifentanil and by R43% after sufentanil. This reflected a significant (P<0.005) increase in propagation of nociceptive afferents as late as 30 min after naloxone reversal. Such potentiation was not observed in the etorphine group, as peak somatosensory-evoked potential deflection and skin-twitch remained below S80% when compared with control.
The pure mu-agonists sufentanil or remifentanil seem to induce a 'bimodal' inhibitory followed by an excitatory effect. The latter is unmasked by naloxone in the postadministration period. In contrast, this is not seen with etorphine, a close congener of buprenorphine. The proposed mode of action of such hyperexcitatory effects may involve second-messenger-mediated G-protein activation, originally proposed by others. Ligands of the oripavine series may present an alternative for prevention of opioid-induced hyperalgesia in patients.
Doxorubicin (DOXO) was coupled to lactosaminated human serum albumin (L-HSA) in order to enhance the drug concentration in the well differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), which can accumulate L-HSA through the asialoglycoprotein receptor. In the present experiments we compared the DOXO concentrations produced by this conjugate (L-HSA-DOXO) and by the uncoupled drug in the well, moderately, and poorly differentiated rat HCCs.
The same dose (1 microg/g) of free or L-HSA coupled-DOXO was injected in rats with HCCs induced by diethylnitrosamine. At different times, the animals were killed and the neoplastic nodules of liver were isolated. Their differentiation grade was determined histologically and their DOXO content was measured.
Unexpectedly, we found that also in the poorly differentiated forms of HCCs, which display no or only a poor capacity of accumulating L-HSA, the conjugate raised DOXO levels that were approximately twofold higher than those produced by the free drug.
The conjugate L-HSA-DOXO could improve the potential of DOXO in the treatment of all HCCs, including the poorly differentiated tumors that are the common forms in the advanced disease for which an effective chemotherapy is particularly needed.
We report the case of a 53 year old woman who attempted suicide taking one high-dose of fluoxetine, developing a manic episode 19 days later. We also make a review about antidepressant-induced mania. In patients with mood disorder, the frequency of antidepressant-induced mania switch has been estimated to be 3.7 to 33%, varying across studies that included different diagnoses and different antidepressant treatments. Among the used data basis (Medline) there are papers reporting fluoxetine-induced mania. All of them include patients receiving adequate dose and time fluoxetine treatment. We found no reports of switch occurring after one high-dose of fluoxetine. As the impact on the clinical management of antidepressant-induced manic switches is quite high, several studies have focused on the possible clinical predictors of this phenomenon. By the time, is not possible to determine whether a manic episode is due to the natural course of bipolar disorder or to the medication. Thus, the phenomenon of antidepressant-induced mania should be defined and investigated with controlled prospective studies.
Despite the known anti-proliferative and tumor-suppressive effects seen with retinoic acid (RA), treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) failed to meet the initial expectations. As the exact mechanisms of action of RA and especially the role of the cellular RA binding proteins (CRABP) have not been elucidated yet, we investigated the expression of CRABP-I and its potential influence on RA response in RCC. Real-time RT-PCR analysis disclosed a significant lack of CRABP-I expression in four RCC cell lines and 12 primary RCC samples; in contrast, high expression levels were found in the respective adjacent normal kidney tissue. To further investigate the impact of CRABP-I on RA response in RCC, A-498 RCC cells were employed as a cellular model system. CRABP-I was stably transfected into A-498 cells which consequently displayed substantial resistance to all-trans (ATRA) and 9-cis RA compared to vector controls lacking CRABP-I. Comparison of gene expression profiles of ATRA-treated CRABP-I-expressing A-498 cells and vector controls revealed specific regulation of 54 of approximately 20,000 genes tested on a selected human CodeLink UniSet Bioarray, with a prominent modulation of genes involved in transcriptional control, signaling, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and metabolism. The genetic changes reported here contribute to a better understanding of the role of RA in RCC. They also provide new insights into CRABP-I-mediated signaling and gene expression.
A 36-year-old man was admitted because of sopor and dark urine after intravenous amphetamine injection. He subsequently developed myoglobinuria and acute renal failure. Serum myoglobin value was remarkably elevated to 83,000 ng/ml, and urine myoglobin was 400,000 ng/ml. Renal biopsy revealed tubular degeneration and tubular obstruction with myoglobin casts by immunofluorescence examination. Amphetamine-induced rhabdomyolysis was suspected to cause myoglobinuric acute renal failure.
Animal and epidemiological studies suggest that dietary heme iron would promote colorectal cancer. Oxidative properties of heme could lead to the formation of cytotoxic and genotoxic secondary lipid oxidation products, such as 4-hydroxy-2(E)-nonenal (HNE). This compound is more cytotoxic to mouse wild-type colon cells than to isogenic cells with a mutation on the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. The latter thus have a selective advantage, possibly leading to cancer promotion. This mutation is an early and frequent event in human colorectal cancer. To explain this difference, the HNE biotransformation capacities of the two cell types have been studied using radiolabeled and stable isotope-labeled HNE. Apc-mutated cells showed better biotransformation capacities than nonmutated cells did. Thiol compound conjugation capacities were higher for mutated cells, with an important advantage for the extracellular conjugation to cysteine. Both cells types were able to reduce HNE to 4-hydroxynonanal, a biotransformation pathway that has not been reported for other intestinal cells. Mutated cells showed higher capacities to oxidize 4-hydroxynonanal into 4-hydroxynonanoic acid. The mRNA expression of different enzymes involved in HNE metabolism such as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1, 2 and 3A1, glutathione transferase A4-4, or cystine transporter xCT was upregulated in mutated cells compared with wild-type cells. In conclusion, this study suggests that Apc-mutated cells are more efficient than wild-type cells in metabolizing HNE into thiol conjugates and 4-hydroxynonanoic acid due to the higher expression of key biotransformation enzymes. These differential biotransformation capacities would explain the differences of susceptibility between normal and Apc-mutated cells regarding secondary lipid oxidation products.
Intermittent treatment with L-dopa over a 2-year period induced abnormal involuntary movements in MPTP-treated squirrel monkeys. Dyskinesias included a choreic and dystonic component. Dose-response curves for chorea and dystonia revealed that the same dose of L-dopa (30 mg/kg) induced the highest score for both dyskinesias: however, the severity was much greater for chorea. Choreic movements were always most prevalent at the time of peak effect, whereas dystonia was apparent at the time of peak effect and at "end-of-dose", and was occasionally observed spontaneously. Our findings indicate that squirrel monkeys treated with MPTP develop L-dopa-induced dyskinesias which closely resemble those observed in Parkinson's disease. This species provides a valuable animal model to develop improved therapeutic agents.
We aimed to characterize the clinical experiences of patients in whom heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) complicated heparin therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and who switched to argatroban.
A retrospective analysis of previously reported prospective, multicentre, historical-controlled Argatroban-911 and Argatroban-915 studies of argatroban therapy in HIT.
Inpatient.
Patients (n = 145) administered heparin for VTE and who developed HIT were identified.
Patients were treated with argatroban 2 mcg kg(-1) min(-1) for up to 14 days, adjusted to maintain activated partial thromboplastin times 1.5 to three times baseline. Patient characteristics, anticoagulation and outcomes were summarized. The primary end-point was a composite of death, amputation, or new thrombosis within 37 days of argatroban initiation.
During heparin therapy, platelet counts decreased (mean +/- SD nadir: 78 +/- 67 x 10(9) L(-1)), and 75 (52%) patients developed thrombosis. After heparin was discontinued, patients received argatroban (mean dose 2.1 +/- 1.2 mcg kg(-1) min(-1)) for 6.8 +/- 4.3 days. By day 6 of argatroban therapy, the mean platelet count rose to >150 x 10(9) L(-1). The primary end-point occurred in 41 (28.3%) patients (values of 26-44% are reported for argatroban therapy of HIT from any heparin indication). Seventeen (11.7%) patients, including 12 who had also experienced thrombosis whilst on heparin, developed new thrombosis after argatroban initiation, typically on the day argatroban was discontinued or later (n = 10). Seven (4.8%) patients experienced major bleeding.
For VTE patients with HIT, argatroban provides effective anticoagulation, with outcomes comparable with those reported for other argatroban-treated HIT patients. New thrombosis in this setting occurred most often in patients with existing HIT-associated thrombosis, before HIT recognition or either at/after argatroban discontinuation.
Drug-induced sialadenitis is uncommon and unrecognized. Drugs such as nitrofurantoïn, nifedipine and methimazole have been reported to induce sialadenitis. However, phenylbutazone and oxyphenbutazone are the most frequently implicated agents. We describe a case of phenylbutazone-induced parotitis and submaxillitis with cutaneous and hepatic involvement.
A 51 year-old woman who had received phenylbutazone for the past 6 days was hospitalized for diagnosis of Quincke's oedema. Clinical examination in fact revealed bilateral parotitis and submaxillitis. The patient had contracted mumps in infancy. Improvement was noticed 8 days after stopping the drug and treatment by glucocorticosteroid. Nevertheless a pruritic eruption with fever appeared. Laboratory data showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, ESR of 75 mm/hr, hepatic cholestasis and cytolysis. Infectious and autoimmune causes were ruled out. The eruption spontaneously disappeared after 5 days. Laboratory studies 3 weeks later were normal.
Quincke's edema diagnosis had been established too fast on "allergic past history" and patient interrogation. Complete clinical examination revealed the correct diagnosis of sialadenitis. This observation shows similarities with other publications: unbearable xerostomia appearing before sialadenitis and with a long course, parotitis with sub-maxillitis, 6 days delay after the first administration of phenylbutazone before fever, local evolution without complication, inflammatory biological syndrome with neutrophilia and absence of infectious cause. Pruritic maculo-papulous eruption and biological hepatic abnormalities are however rare. An hypersensibility mechanism is discussed.
Disruption of arachidonic acid pathways and prostaglandin signalling has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
We intended to study prostaglandin signalling in groups of young schizophrenia patients, first-degree relatives, and healthy controls in order to assess effects of heritability on this biological marker-one important endophenotype criterion.
Namely, we assessed intensity of methylnicotinate skin flushing using optical reflection spectroscopy. Tests were applied to 19 adolescent first-episode schizophrenia patients, 21 first-degree relatives, and groups of age and gender matched healthy controls.
Compared to healthy controls, attenuation of skin flushing at low niacin concentrations was found only in schizophrenia patients, but not in first-degree relatives.
While our results indicate niacin hyposensitivity as reliable biological marker in schizophrenia, they do not provide clear evidence for its heritability. Particularly, the results in adolescent schizophrenia patients are suggestive for the perception of attenuated niacin flushing as secondary to the pathophysiology at the onset of schizophrenic illness, namely increased oxidative stress, alterations of unspecific immune-response or inflammation-like processes.
Home-fortification of complementary foods with micronutrients (including iron) as Sprinkles is a new strategy to control iron deficiency and anaemia in developing countries. However, the most effective dose and form of iron is not known. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of various doses (12.5, 20 or 30 mg) and treatment methods (multi-micronutrient Sprinkles vs. ferrous sulphate drops) on haemoglobin (Hb) concentration after 8 weeks of treatment in anaemic children. In total, 133 anaemic Ghanaian children (Hb 70-99 g L(-1)) aged 6-18 months were randomly assigned to one of five daily interventions for 8 weeks. Out of the five interventions, four used Sprinkles, and one used iron drops. Of the four Sprinkles groups, three included 12.5, 20 or 30 mg of iron as ferrous fumarate, and one included 20 mg of iron as ferric pyrophosphate. The iron drops group included 12.5 mg of iron as liquid ferrous sulphate. Hb concentrations were measured at baseline, week 3 and week 8. The primary outcome measure was Hb concentration at 8 weeks after treatment. We compared differences in Hb and ferritin concentrations and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia (Hb < 100 g L(-1) and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations >8.5 mg L(-1)) from baseline to 8 weeks within and between groups. Adherence and reporting of side effects (staining of the teeth, ease of use, diarrhoea and darkening of stools) were compared between groups. Mean change in Hb was 1.4 g L(-1) (SD = 1.8) (P = 0.0001). Change in Hb concentrations from baseline to 8 weeks was significant in all groups (P = 0.0001-0.0007), with no differences across groups. Geometric means of serum ferritin varied from 18.6 to 44.0 microg L(-1) at baseline. At week 8, these means were in the interval of 48.0-78.3 microg L(-1), with no group differences. Prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia decreased significantly from baseline to 8 weeks in all groups with the exception of the iron drops group, with no group differences. Adherence was lower in the drops group (64%) as compared with Sprinkles groups (84%). Greater staining of the teeth and less ease of use were reported in the drops group as compared with Sprinkles groups. A dose as low as 12.5 mg of iron as ferrous fumarate when provided as Sprinkles may be effective in anaemic children.
Nicotinic acid (niacin) has been shown to decrease myocyte injury. Because interventions that lower the cytosolic NADH/NAD(+) ratio improve glycolysis and limit infarct size, we hypothesized that 1) niacin, as a precursor of NAD(+), would lower the NADH/NAD(+) ratio, increase glycolysis, and limit ischemic injury and 2) these cardioprotective benefits of niacin would be limited in conditions that block lactate removal. Isolated rat hearts were perfused without (Ctl) or with 1 microM niacin (Nia) and subjected to 30 min of low-flow ischemia (10% of baseline flow, LF) and reperfusion. To examine the effects of limiting lactate efflux, experiments were performed with 1) Ctl and Nia groups subjected to zero-flow ischemia and 2) the Nia group treated with the lactate-H(+) cotransport inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate under LF conditions. Measured variables included ATP, pH, cardiac function, tissue lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (reflecting NADH/NAD(+)), lactate efflux rate, and creatine kinase release. The lactate-to-pyruvate ratio was reduced by more than twofold in Nia-LF hearts during baseline and ischemic conditions (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively), with concurrent lower creatine kinase release than Ctl hearts (P < 0.05). Nia-LF hearts had significantly greater lactate release during ischemia (P < 0.05 vs. Ctl hearts) as well as higher functional recovery and a relative preservation of high-energy phosphates. Inhibiting lactate efflux with alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and blocking lactate washout with zero flow negated some of the beneficial effects of niacin. During LF, niacin lowered the cytosolic redox state and increased lactate efflux, consistent with redox regulation of glycolysis. Niacin significantly improved functional and metabolic parameters under these conditions, providing additional rationale for use of niacin as a therapeutic agent in patients with ischemic heart disease.
