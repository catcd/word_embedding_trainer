Although magnesium ions (Mg2+) are known to display many similar features to other 2+ charged cations, they seem to have quite an important and unique role in biological settings, such as NMDA blocking effect. However, the role of Mg2+ in the neural transmission system has not been studied as sufficiently as calcium ions (Ca2+). To clarify the sensory effects of Mg2+ in peripheral nervous systems, sensory changes after intradermal injection of Mg2+ were studied in humans.
Magnesium sulphate, magnesium chloride and saline were injected into the skin of the anterior region of forearms in healthy volunteers and injection-induced irritating pain ("irritating pain", for short), tactile sensation, tactile pressure thresholds, pinch-pain changes and intolerable heat pain thresholds of the lesion were monitored.
Flare formation was observed immediately after magnesium sulphate or magnesium chloride injection. We found that intradermal injections of magnesium sulphate and magnesium chloride transiently caused irritating pain, hypesthesia to noxious and innocuous mechanical stimulations, whereas secondary hyperalgesia due to mechanical stimuli was not observed. In contrast to mechanical stimuli, intolerable heat pain-evoking temperature was significantly decreased at the injection site. In addition to these results, spontaneous pain was immediately attenuated by local cooling.
Membrane-stabilizing effect and peripheral NMDA-blocking effect possibly produced magnesium-induced mechanical hypesthesia, and extracellular cation-induced sensitization of TRPV1 channels was thought to be the primary mechanism of magnesium-induced heat hyperalgesia.
Carvedilol (Dilatrend) blocks beta(1)-, beta(2)- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, and has antioxidant and antiproliferative effects. Carvedilol improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) in numerous studies. Moreover, significantly greater increases from baseline in LVEF were seen with carvedilol than with metoprolol in a double-blind, randomised study and in a meta-analysis. Carvedilol also reversed or attenuated left ventricular remodelling in patients with CHF and in those with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Combined analysis of studies in the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program (patients had varying severities of CHF; n = 1094) revealed that mortality was significantly lower in carvedilol than in placebo recipients. In addition, the risk of hospitalisation for any cardiovascular cause was significantly lower with carvedilol than with placebo. Mortality was significantly lower with carvedilol than with metoprolol in patients with mild to severe CHF in the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) [n = 3029]. The Carvedilol Prospective Randomised Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) trial (n = 2289) demonstrated that compared with placebo, carvedilol was associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality and the combined endpoint of death or hospitalisation for any reason in severe CHF. All-cause mortality was reduced in patients who received carvedilol in addition to conventional therapy compared with those who received placebo plus conventional therapy in the Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival Control in LV Dysfunction (CAPRICORN) trial (enrolling 1959 patients with left ventricular dysfunction following acute MI). Carvedilol was generally well tolerated in patients with CHF. Adverse events associated with the alpha- and beta-blocking effects of the drug occurred more commonly with carvedilol than with placebo, whereas placebo recipients were more likely to experience worsening heart failure. In conclusion, carvedilol blocks beta(1)-, beta(2)- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors and has a unique pharmacological profile. It is thought that additional properties of carvedilol (e.g. antioxidant and antiproliferative effects) contribute to its beneficial effects in CHF. Carvedilol improves ventricular function and reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with mild to severe CHF, and should be considered a standard treatment option in this setting. Administering carvedilol in addition to conventional therapy reduces mortality and attenuates myocardial remodelling in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following acute MI. Moreover, mortality was significantly lower with carvedilol than with metoprolol in patients with mild to severe CHF, suggesting that carvedilol may be the preferred beta-blocker.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 200 mg/kg body weight). Two weeks later the rats were divided into 4 groups; DEN-C group rats were given no further treatment; DEN-DES group rats were fed diethylstilbestrol (DES, 0.5 mg/day); DEN-TMX group rats were given tamoxifen (TMX, 1.0 mg/day) orally; DEN-DES TMX group rats were fed both DES and TMX for 8 months. Rats of the DEN-DES group developed grossly visible hepatic tumors. On the other hand, tumor development was significantly inhibited in rats of the DEN-DES TMX group. Total area of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive lesions and the mean area per lesion were significantly larger in rats of the DEN-DES group than those of the DEN-C, DEN-TMX or DEN-DES-TMX group. Estrogen receptor (ER) content of liver cytosol assayed by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was significantly greater in rats of the DEN-DES group than in those of the DEN-C group and smaller in rats of the DEN-TMX and DEN-DES TMX group than in the DEN-C group. On the contrary, ER content of liver nuclei was significantly greater in rats of the DEN-TMX and DEN-DES TMX group than in those of the DEN-C or DEN-DES group. These results suggest that the promotive action of DES and the inhibitory action of TMX on DES-promoted hepatic tumorigenesis are, at least in part, mediated by ER in the rat.
Thioridazine (Mellaril) hydrochloride cardiotoxicity is manifested by bradycardia and prolongation of the QT interval. The latter predisposes to atypical ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) when premature ventricular depolarizations occur during the prolonged QT interval. Isoproterenol hydrochloride infusion, which increases the heart rate and shortens the QT interval, is a theoretically advantageous therapeutic modality for use in this situation. This report describes a case of thioridazine-induced torsade de pointes that was successfully managed with isoproterenol infusion after therapy with other agents was unsuccessful. This mode of therapy should be used with caution, but it may be lifesaving in psychiatric or community hospitals where temporary cardiac pacemaker insertion is not performed.
To develop a more efficient antithrombotic way after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the anticoagulant effects were compared of human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) gene transfection and aspirin oral administration (traditional method) on vein grafts. An eukaryotic expression plasmid pCMV-(Kozak) TFPI was prepared. Animal model of carotid artery bypass grafting was constructed. In operation, endothelial cells of vein grafts in TFPI group and empty plasmid control group were transfected with pCMV-(Kozak) TFPI and empty plasmid pCMV respectively, while no transfection was conducted in aspirin control group. After operation, aspirin (2 mg.kg(-1).(-1)) was administered (i.g.) in aspirin control group. Three days later, grafts (n=10) were harvested for RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses of exogenous gene expression and for pathological, scanning electron microscopic observation of thrombus. Thirty days later, the patency rates of remnant grafts (n=10) were recorded by vessel Doppler ultrasonography. Human TFPI gene products were detected in gene transferred vein grafts. Three days later, thrombi were found in 7 animals of aspirin control group and in 8 animals of empty plasmid control group, but in only 1 of TFPI group (P<0.01). Thirty days later, 5 grafts were occluded in empty plasmid control group, but none of grafts was occluded in the other groups (P<0.05). The endothelial surfaces of grafts in both of the control groups were covered with aggregated erythrocytes and platelets, and it were not seen in TFPI group. It was suggested that the anticoagulant effects on vein grafts of human TFPI gene transfection are better than those of aspirin.
Niceritrol, a drug with peripheral tissue vasodilatory and serum lipid-lowering activity, was administered for 2 mo to rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes. Physiological and biochemical studies were subsequently conducted on rat nerve tissue. A markedly lower value of approximately 47% in sciatic nerve blood flow (SNBF) was detected in an untreated diabetic (DC) group than in a nondiabetic control group (CC). A significant delay in caudal motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and significantly higher glucose, sorbitol, and fructose values were observed in the sciatic nerve and serum lipids. In contrast, a niceritrol-treated diabetic (DN) group had significantly higher SNBF, MNCV, and sciatic nerve myo-inositol values and lower serum triglyceride levels than group DC. No differences between these two groups were noted in glucose, sorbitol, and fructose levels in the sciatic nerve, or in cholesterol and glucose in serum. These findings suggest that niceritrol has a clear inhibitory effect on the development of delayed MNCV in the diabetic rat, which may be due to reduced nerve blood flow and/or decreased nerve myo-inositol levels.
Prenatal choline supplementation can protect rats against cognitive deficits induced by status epilepticus induced by the cholinergic agent pilocarpine [J. Neurosci. 20 (2000) 1]. In the present day, we have extended this novel finding by investigating the effects of pre- and postnatal choline supplementation in memory deficits associated with status epilepticus induced with kainic acid (KA). In the first experiment pregnant rats received a normal, choline-supplemented, or choline deficient diet starting on the 11th day of gestation and continuing until postnatal (P) 7. At P42, rats were given a convulsant dosage of KA. Two weeks following the KA-induced status epilepticus rats underwent testing of visual-spatial memory using the Morris water maze test. Rats receiving supplemental choline performed better in the water maze than the deficient and control groups. Moreover, the activity of hippocampal choline acetyltransferase was 18% lower in the choline deficient animals as compared with the other two groups. In the second experiment we administered KA to P35 rats that had been given a normal diet. Following the status epilepticus the rats were given a choline-supplemented or control diet for 4 weeks and then tested in the water maze. Rats receiving choline supplementation performed far better than rats receiving a regular diet. This study demonstrates that choline supplementation prior to or following KA-induced status epilepticus can protect rats from memory deficits induced by status epilepticus.
The authors conducted this study to determine if very-low-dose (i.e., 4 ppm) mercury is nephrotoxic and, if so, whether the nephrotoxic actions of mercury in mice could be prevented by zinc intake. Animals were administered 4 ppm mercuric chloride and/or 800 ppm zinc chloride in their drinking water for 12 wk. The animals were sacrificed at the end of the exposure period, and their kidneys were excised, weighed, and processed for histological study. Both metals reduced significantly (p < .05) the absolute and relative kidney weights of the animals. Zinc-treated animals showed normal kidney histology that was comparable with that of the control. Mercury treatment produced necrosis and widening of the glomeruli, whereas a combination of both metals resulted in protection from the toxic effects, with most nephrons resembling the control. The results indicate that low-dose mercury exposure in mice kidney induces some degenerative effects, which are prevented by zinc.
Amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine are suspected of being pulmonary hypertension risk factors based on a small number of case reports along with pharmacologic similarities to fenfluramine, a diet drug associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We sought to determine whether rates of stimulant use are increased in patients believed to have idiopathic PAH compared with patients with PAH and known risk factors and patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).
In this retrospective study, rates of stimulant use were determined for 340 patients with idiopathic PAH, PAH and known risk factors, or CTEPH seen between November 2002 and April 2004. "Stimulant" use was defined as any reported use of amphetamine, methamphetamine, or cocaine. Odds of stimulant use were calculated using a polychotomous logistic regression model.
A history of stimulant use was found in 28.9% of patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic PAH, compared with 3.8% of patients with PAH and a known risk factor, and 4.3% of patients with CTEPH. After adjustment for differences in age, patients with idiopathic PAH were 10.14 times (95% confidence interval, 3.39 to 30.3; p < 0.0001) more likely to have used stimulants than patients with PAH and known risk factors, and 7.63 times (95% confidence interval, 2.99 to 19.5; p < 0.0001) more likely to have used stimulants than patients with CTEPH.
Patients with idiopathic PAH are significantly more likely to have used stimulants than patients with other forms of pulmonary hypertension.
A 17-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of common paroxysmal atrial flutter. His electrocardiogram at rest showed subtle ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aV(F). Intravenous pilsicainide caused further ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads, new ST-segment depression in leads V2-V6, two distinct forms of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) triggering short runs of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). An infusion of isoproterenol suppressed these arrhythmias and normalized the ST-segment. Pilsicainide may induce PVCs and polymorphic VT in atypical Brugada syndrome.
The present study was designed to examine the effect of the grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) on developing hepatic fibrosis that was induced by thioacetamide (TAA) in mice. Administration of TAA for 9 weeks led to a serious necrosis and apoptosis of the parenchymal cells, which resulted in an accumulation of excessive collagen in the liver and an increase of transformed hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In addition, the mRNA expression of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), as the marker of the activated HSCs, and α1-(I)-collagen were all up-regulated significantly when compared with the control. However, combined oral administration of GSPE at 100 mg/kg suppressed the mRNA expression of TGF-β1 and α-SMA, with decreased collagen accumulation as demonstrated by histomorphological evaluation and quantitative RT-PCR. The mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory factors, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), was remarkably enhanced by TAA treatment. However, their levels displayed a down-regulated trend beyond simultaneous GSPE treatment. Moreover, GSPE administration markedly suppressed lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, as a plant antioxidant, GSPE manifested effective hepatocellular protective action to ameliorate the developing liver fibrosis induced by chronic TAA administration in mice.
CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein), SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling), or SSI (signal transducers and activators of transcription [STAT]-induced STAT inhibitor) proteins are a family of cytokine-inducible negative regulators of cytokine signaling via Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT pathways. Given the evidence that the JAK-STAT pathway plays a critical role in the cardiovascular system, the primary objective of this study was to assess the effects of the CIS family on JAK-STAT signaling in the cardiovascular system in rats treated with cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), an interleukin-6 family of cytokines. Intravenous injection of 20 microgram/kg body weight of CT-1 induced a transient, marked increase in STAT3 activation in various tissues, including heart and lung, and subsequent upregulation of 2 members of the CIS family, JAK-binding protein (JAB)/SOCS-1/SSI-1 and CIS3/SOCS-3/SSI-3, in the same tissues. It was also observed that CIS3 was directly associated with JAK2 in vivo. Pretreatment with the same dose of CT-1 60 minutes before significantly attenuated the STAT3 activation induced by a second injection of CT-1. We previously reported that intravenous injection of CT-1 results in the nitric oxide (NO)-dependent hypotension accompanied by the induction of inducible NO synthase mRNA. In rats pretreated with CT-1, the induction of inducible NO synthase mRNA or hypotension by subsequent CT-1 injection was not observed. Forced expression of JAB or CIS3, but not other CISs, directly blocked CT-1-induced STAT3 activation in 293 cells. These results suggest that JAB and CIS3 serve as endogenous inhibitors of CT-1-mediated JAK-STAT signaling in the cardiovascular system in vivo.
Thirty-four patients were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin. Thirty infections occurring in 28 patients were assessable for the efficacy analysis. The drug dosage was 300 mg every 12 hours in 19 patients and 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours in nine patients. Twelve patients were also given ciprofloxacin orally after initial intravenous therapy. The mean duration of total therapy was 31 days. The overall clinical response rate was 87 percent, and the bacteriologic response rate was 70 percent. Favorable responses were observed in 10 of 12 patients with osteomyelitis/septic arthritis; seven of eight with soft tissue infection; four of four with pneumonitis; one of two with cystic fibrosis; and four of four with urinary tract infections. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in three Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Toxicity was minor: phlebitis occurred in six patients, nausea in six, and rash in one. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin or intravenous ciprofloxacin followed by oral ciprofloxacin is a safe and effective therapy for serious infections.
2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is an agricultural contaminant found in rural ground water. It remains to be determined whether neither 2,4-D poses environmental risks, nor is the mechanism of toxicity known at the molecular level. To evaluate the potential ecological risk of 2,4-D, we assessed the biological parameters including the survival rate, adult sex ratio of emerged adults, and mouthpart deformities in Chironomus riparius after long-term exposure to 2,4-D. The larvae were treated with 0.1, 1 or, 10microgL(-1) of 2,4-D for short- and long-term exposure periods. The sex ratio was changed in C. riparius exposed to only 10microgL(-1) of 2,4-D, whereas mouthpart deformities were observed as significantly higher in C. riparius exposed to 0.1microgL(-1) of 2,4-D. Survival rates were not significantly affected by 2,4-D. Furthermore, we evaluated the molecular and biochemical responses of biomarker genes such as gene expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), ferritins and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in C. riparius exposed to 2,4-D for 24h. The expressions of HSP70, HSP40, HSP90 and GST levels in C. riparius were significantly increased after exposure to a 10microgL(-1) concentration of 2,4-D, whereas ferritin heavy and light chain gene expressions were significantly increased at all concentrations of 2,4-D exposure. Finally, these results may provide an important contribution to our understanding of the toxicology of 2,4-D herbicide in C. riparius. Moreover, the 2,4-D-mediated gene expressions may be generated by 2,4-D is the causative effects on most probable cause of the observed alterations. These biological, molecular and morphological parameters and the measured parameters can be used to monitor 2,4-D toxicity in an aquatic environment.
We previously described the physicochemical characteristics (particle size, adsorbed polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], oxygen, and metal content) of butadiene soot (BDS) nanoparticles generated during incomplete combustion of the high-volume industrial petrochemical, 1,3-butadiene. We also demonstrated localization of BDS-delivered PAHs to lipid droplets of murine and human respiratory cells in vitro and up-regulation of biotransformation and oxidative stress responses in these cells. Here, the objective was to determine whether inhalation of BDS nanoparticles promotes up-regulation of Phase I biotransformation enzymes, oxidative stress responses, and inflammation in the lungs of mice. Female Balb/c mice exposed to BDS (5 mg/m(3), 4 h/d, 4 d) were killed immediately or 1 day after final exposure; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from the lungs; total RNA was extracted from one lung and histopathology performed on the other. Histopathology and BALF analysis revealed particle-laden macrophages in airways of BDS-treated mice, accompanied by neutrophilia and epithelial damage. Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses revealed up-regulation of (1) aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-responsive genes: AhR repressor (Ahrr) and cytochrome P450 IA1 and IB1(Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1); (2) oxidative stress response genes: heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1), nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nfe2l2), NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1 (Nqo1), and glutathione peroxidase 2 (Gpx2); and (3) pro-inflammatory genes: interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-X-C motif ligand 2 (Cxcl2; analog to human IL-8) and ligand 3 (Cxcl3), and granulocyte chemotactic protein (Cxcl6). Inhalation of PAH-rich, petrochemical combustion-derived nanoparticles causes airway inflammation and induces expression of AhR-associated and oxidative stress response genes, as seen in vitro, plus pro-inflammatory genes.
A 45-year-old male underwent a trabeculectomy with mitomycin C for a secondary glaucoma after complicated cataract surgery. Because of early bleb failure a needling procedure with subconjunctival injection of mitomycin C was performed. Five days postoperatively the patient developed an occlusion of both the arterial and venous retinal vasculature. A relation between the diffusion of mitomycin C into the vitreous cavity and the development of retinal toxicity is suggested.
52 ketamine users were "opportunistically" recruited to take part in a survey of the psychological effects of the drug, in Manchester, United Kingdom in 2008. Twenty-seven ketamine-naïve respondents were also recruited for comparison in respect of "other" recreational drug use and level of schizotypy. Ketamine users attributed a wide range of appetitive, aversive, after-effect, and dissociative experiences to the drug. They also reported using a much wider range of other recreational drugs than ketamine non-users. Former users reported significantly fewer positive or dissociative experiences than current users.
Currently available non-invasive imaging methods frequently fail to detect alterations in left ventricular (LV) function despite histological evidence of injury. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) can detect subtle LV dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate whether TDI indices can predict LV systolic dysfunction and mortality following exposure to doxorubicin (DOX) in mice.
TDI-derived peak endocardial systolic velocity (V(ENDO)) and strain rate (SR), as well as M-mode and two-dimensional indices of LV systolic function, were measured serially in mice after receiving DOX as a single dose (20 mg/kg). Haemodynamic measurements were obtained invasively before and at 1, 2, 4, and 5 days after the single DOX dose. Cardiac apoptosis was measured before and at 1 day after DOX. V(ENDO) and SR decreased after 1 and 2 days, respectively, whereas changes in fractional shortening (FS) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were not detected before 5 days. The reduction in both V(ENDO) and SR correlated with the decrease in dP/dt(MAX), and the change in V(ENDO) correlated with the early increase in cardiac cell apoptosis. In a subsequent experiment, DOX was administered at 4 mg/kg/week for 5 weeks, and LV function was followed serially for 16 weeks. In this chronic experiment, TDI indices decreased before FS and LVEF, correlated with late LV dysfunction, and predicted DOX-induced mortality.
In a murine model of DOX-induced cardiac injury, TDI detects LV dysfunction prior to alterations in conventional echocardiographic indices and predicts mortality. This study suggests that TDI may be a reliable tool to detect early subtle changes in DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Eighteen patients of lymphoma, treated with vincristine (VCR) were assessed clinically and electrophysiologically before and for 3 months after therapy. The earliest evidence of neuropathy was impaired ankle jerk (around 2 weeks) and the earliest symptom was paraesthesia (by 4-5 weeks). At the end of the study, all the patients had absent ankle jerks and 75% had sensory symptoms and/or signs, the most frequent being impaired vibration sensation (62.5%). Motor abnormalities were much less common (18.7%) and constipation (62.5%) was the only autonomic manifestation. Concentric needle electromyography showed evidence of denervation (46.7%), especially in the small muscles of hand. Conduction studies showed prolonged mean distal latencies, decreased mean amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials, with almost unchanged conduction velocities. However, no conduction block was noted and F-wave studies were normal. During early weeks, in spite of impaired absent ankle jerks, H reflex was elicitable in the majority. However, later 56.2% had absent H reflex. The present study concludes that vincristine produces a distal symmetrical sensorimotor neuropathy, predominantly involving the large diameter fibers in the early stages. Electrophysiological studies characterize it as a distal axonopathy. However it is dependent on the dose of VCR and the duration of therapy: though in the usual doses it does produce neuropathy, it is rarely disabling in the early months.
Assessment of the relation between oral risperidone dose, serum drug levels and clinical response may provide important information for rational treatment decisions. Inter-individual differences in the liver cytochrome P450 system, especially in the CYP2D6 subsystem, which account for a significant portion of risperidone metabolism, may also influence plasma drug levels and alter clinical response parameters. We thus prospectively investigated risperidone serum concentrations in relation to clinical efficacy and side-effects and genotyped major CYP2D6 polymorphisms to determine their effect upon these parameters.
Neuroleptic monotherapy with risperidone was administered to schizophrenia patients in a 6-week open dose clinical trial. Weekly assessments including CGI and PANSS ratings to assess psychopathology; SAS to assess medication side effects; and blood draws to quantify steady state plasma levels of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone were carried out. In addition, major CYP2D6 polymorphisms including alleles *4, *6 and *14 were genotyped.
Eighty-two patients were recruited. Mean oral dose of risperidone was 4.3 +/- 0.9 mg. Mean plasma level of both risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone together ("active moiety") was 41.6 +/- 26.6 ng/ml. Significant improvements in PANSS scales and the various subscales ensued. There was a positive linear correlation between active moiety plasma levels and dose (r = 0.291, p = 0.015) and between risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone levels (r = 0.262; p = 0.016). Nonresponders to pharmacotherapy (PANSS-Improvement < 30%) showed significantly higher active moiety plasma levels (49.9 +/- 30.7 ng/ml) than responders (38.2 +/- 17.0 ng/ml; p = 0.045) without significantly higher oral doses (p = 0.601). Patients with longer illness duration (> or = 3 years) had significantly higher plasma drug levels than those with a shorter course (< 3 years; p = 0.039). Extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and plasma levels were not correlated (r = 0.028; p = 0.843), but higher plasma levels at week 2 predicted an incidence for EPS (p < 0.050). Accordingly, patients initially receiving higher oral doses of risperidone were significantly more likely to respond with EPS in the trial course. Eight patients (9.8%) were heterozygous carriers of the CYP2D6 allele *4. CYP2D6 polymorphisms did not predict clinical response, but predicted a tendential increase in the plasma risperidone to 9-OH-risperidone ratio (0.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.9 +/- 1.8; p = 0.120).
The major finding was that responders to risperidone treatment had significantly lower blood levels of risperidone and 9-OH risperidone than patients who did not respond to the treatment despite administration of similar oral doses. The observed CYP2D6 polymorphisms did not contribute to altered clinical efficacy, but affected risperidone to 9-OH-risperidone ratios. Increased plasma levels of the active moiety in patients with longer illness may represent general aging effects. Conversely, the observed higher plasma levels in nonresponders may derive from unaccounted genetic metabolism abnormalities or Phase II metabolism disturbances. Patients initially receiving higher oral risperidone doses were more likely to respond with extrapyramidal side effects which reaffirms the need for careful titration. The high inter-individual variability in risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone metabolization and the relationship between clinical outcome and plasma levels warrants regular plasma level monitoring of both compounds to assess for the clinically relevant active moiety.
To compare the efficacy of alfentanil, remifentanil, and saline in minimizing the propofol injection pain.
Randomized, double-blind study.
University hospital.
175 ASA physical status I and II, adult female patients undergoing minor gynecological procedures with general anesthesia.
Unpremedicated patients were randomly allocated to one of four groups. Patients received 2 mL (1 mg) of alfentanil (n=43), 2 mL of remifentanil 0.01 mg (n = 43), 2 mL of remifentanil 0.02 mg (n=45), or 2 mL of saline (n=44) 30 seconds prior to administration 5 mL of propofol 1%.
Patients were asked whether they had pain due to propofol injection. Their pain scores were evaluated with a Visual Analogue Scale. In the Postanesthesia Care Unit, frequency of postoperative nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and flushing were all determined.
The remifentanil and alfentanil groups showed significantly less frequency and severity of pain than the saline group (p <0.05). When the alfentanil group was compared with the remifentanil groups, significant differences in pain relief associated with injection of propofol (p <0.001) were noted. Remifentanil 0.02 mg relieved pain associated with injection of propofol more effectively than remifentanil 0.01 mg (p <0.001).
The remifentanil and alfentanil groups showed significantly less frequency and severity of pain than did the saline group. Remifentanil was effective in preventing propofol injection pain, and should be used at a dose of at least 0.02 mg for this purpose. Remifentanil may be an alternative drug for prevention of propofol injection pain.
The effect of the intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of pertussis toxin on penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine and oxytocin was studied in male rats. Pertussis toxin (2 micrograms ICV) prevented the above behavioral responses to apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg SC) and oxytocin (30 ng ICV) on day 3 and 4, but not on day 0 and 1 after treatment. Oxytocin and apomorphine responses were restored on day 6. Similar results were obtained by microinjecting pertussis toxin (0.5 microgram) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the most sensitive brain area for the induction of penile erection and yawning by oxytocin and apomorphine. The results suggest that G proteins are involved in the expression of above responses to apomorphine and oxytocin.
A population of New Zealand White rabbits has been found to exhibit behavioral convulsions when given low intravenous doses of psychoactive cannabinoids of marijuana. The behavioral convulsions decrease in severity and then disappear after the long-term administration of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The extreme sensitivity of these rabbits to the stimulant action of cannabinoids suggests that the population might serve as a model in studies of the stimulant action of cannabinoids.
An open multicentric pediatric clinical trial has been performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of astemizole (HISMANAL suspension) at a 1 ml (2 mg) dosage per 10 kg body weight once daily in children with chronic urticaria. A good and very good effect has been observed in 63.2% of the children at day 7, in 79.2% after 2 weeks and in 88.9% at the end of the treatment (4 weeks). A marked improvement of the symptoms was reported in 63.8% of children at day 7. There was no decrease of efficacy at the end of the treatment. Tolerance was good in 87.% of the cases. Astemizole seems to be a useful treatment for chronic urticaria in pediatrics.
