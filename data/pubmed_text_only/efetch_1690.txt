Effects of estradiol-17 beta and the estrogenicity of different doses of the technical grade pesticide methoxychlor were compared in the vagina, uterus, and oviducts of neonatal mice. Beginning within 24 h of birth, neonates received 10 daily i.p. injections of sesame oil vehicle, 10.0 micrograms estradiol, or 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg methoxychlor. Estradiol injections induced precocious vaginal opening, complete vaginal cornification, and increased total reproductive tract weight and its DNA content. In comparison to the controls, the three highest methoxychlor doses also significantly increased the weights of the reproductive tracts and stimulated their development. The two highest doses (0.5 and 1.0 mg) also induced precocious vaginal opening and complete vaginal cornification. In addition, the same two doses produced atypical cells in the uterus and oviducts that may be indicative of early dysplasia; similar atypia were not recorded following estradiol treatments. Total DNA content in various reproductive organs increased with increased methoxychlor dosages. Dose-response changes were observed in the oviduct and uterus but not vagina. In summary, methoxychlor stimulated the development of neonatal female reproductive tracts, even at concentrations not previously reported to be biologically active. Furthermore, the higher doses induced abnormalities that were not seen following estradiol treatment; these abnormalities may represent precursors of pathological changes.
In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) in a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in rats. BMCs obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of status epilepticus (SE). Spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were monitored using Racine's seizure severity scale. All of the rats in the saline-treated epileptic control group developed SRS, whereas none of the BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures in the short term (15 days after transplantation), regardless of the BMC source. Over the long-term chronic phase (120 days after transplantation), only 25% of BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures, but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control group. The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved. At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapses, long-term potentiation was preserved in BMC-transplanted rats compared to epileptic controls. The donor-derived GFP(+) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted epileptic rats. In conclusion, treatment with BMCs can prevent the development of chronic seizures, reduce neuronal loss, and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network.
Effects of technical grade methoxychlor (MX), an estrogenic insecticide, and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) were examined on serum testosterone (T) concentrations and growth and histology of neonatal male mouse reproductive organs. Male NIH/Swiss mice received i.p. injections daily from birth to Day 9 with one of the following: 10 micrograms E2 or 0.1 or 1.0 mg MX or sesame oil vehicle. The mice were killed on Day 10. MX or did not affect body weights or mortality. Serum T concentrations in control mice were 0.29 +/- 0.03 ng/ml; T concentrations in males treated with MX or E2 were reduced. The 1.0-mg dose of both MX and E2 significantly decreased DNA contents of the seminal vesicles (SV), bulbourethral glands (BUG), and ventral prostate (VP) compared to controls. In the same animals, DNA contents of testes, epididymides, and efferent ductules were not decreased. The lower dose of MX (0.1 mg) decreased DNA content of only BUG and SV. DNA content of the ductus deferens was not affected by any treatment. E2 and both doses of MX also decreased epithelial morphogenesis in the SV and BUG, and inhibited the onset of mucin production in BUG epithelium and smooth muscle differentiation in the ductus deferens. In summary, our results indicate that technical grade MX, at doses as low as 0.1 mg/day, and E2 inhibit neonatal male reproductive tract development and decrease serum T concentrations.
A 66-year-old woman had progressive bilateral optic neuropathy with dense central scotomas and dyschromatopsia. She had been taking oral methotrexate 2.5 mg three times per week for rheumatoid arthritis for the previous 10 months (total intake 322.5 mg) without folic acid supplementation. She had never smoked or abused alcohol and her diet was healthy. Serum folate was reduced at 1.6 ng/mL (normal >4 ng/mL) and vitamin B12 levels were normal. After stopping methotrexate and after administration of oral folic acid, she experienced complete recovery of vision. Serum folate levels returned to normal during folic acid treatment but decreased to below normal once folic treatment was stopped. The persistently low folate level remains unexplained and may reflect a genetic defect in folate metabolism. Methotrexate can cause toxic side effects resulting from folate inhibition but has not been shown definitively to cause a reversible optic neuropathy associated with low serum folate.
The development of deep venous thrombophlebitis in a lithium-intoxicated patient is described. The sedation, lassitude, and decreased activity of the toxic state are proposed as risk factors for the development of hemostasis and thrombophlebitis. The need for greater awareness of this possible complication in patients who are lithium toxic is advanced.
Transient Left Ventricular Apical Ballooning Syndrome (TLVABS) has been described to occur in response to number of stressful events, drug effects or drug withdrawal. Withdrawal of beta blockade has not been described to precipitate TLVABS. We are describing a case of TLVABS developing after abrupt withdrawal of metoprolol.
A 52-year-old woman underwent successful resection of stage IIB primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix and was started on capecitabine chemotherapy. Five days into the first course, after initially experiencing diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and a transient episode of retrosternal chest pain radiating to the left scapula, she presented to the emergency department with cardiogenic shock.

Effects of (4R)-hexahydro-7, 7-dimethyl-6-oxo-1, 2, 5-dithiazocine-4-carboxylic acid (SA3443) on acetaminophen-induced liver injury were investigated in BALB/c mice. SA3443 (30-300 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently suppressed the elevation of serum transaminase activities and the histological changes of liver induced by acetaminophen (150 mg/kg, p.o.). The compound at the same doses also reduced the mortality due to the lethal acute hepatic failure induced by acetaminophen (350 mg/kg, p.o.). Other hepatoprotective agents, cianidanol (500 mg/kg, p.o.), malotilate (100 mg/kg, p.o.), grycyrrhizine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and cysteine (300 mg/kg, p.o.) similarly reduced it. SA3443 had no effect on glutathione (GSH) contents in the liver of normal mice, but it dose-dependently suppressed the decrease of GSH contents in the liver of BALB/c mice treated with acetaminophen. These results suggest that SA3443, a novel cyclic disulfide, provides considerable protection against acetaminophen-induced liver injury and that one of the modes of the hepatoprotective action of this compound is suppression of the decrease of GSH contents in the liver.
Precautionary warnings for severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis from the coadministration of statins and fibrates have been well publicized. However, a recent cerivastatin labeling change made the combined use with fibric acid derivatives a contraindication. Practical recommendations for clinicians who care for patients with refractory mixed hyperlipidemia are needed.
To provide recommendations for clinicians in the treatment of refractory mixed hyperlipidemia.
A comprehensive MEDLINE (1966-July 2000) and bibliographic search was performed.
Thirty-six published clinical trials and 29 case reports involving combination therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives regarding the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reviewed. The literature review demonstrated that combination therapy with a statin and fibrate increases the risk of muscle damage, with an incidence of 0.12%. Risk factors that predispose patients to myopathy caused by combination statin-fibrate therapy include increased age, female gender, renal or liver disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, debilitated status, surgery, trauma, excessive alcohol intake, and heavy exercise.
Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. When monotherapy with a statin fails to control mixed hyperlipidemia, combination therapy may be considered. Niacin may be added before a fibrate is considered, as it appears to have less risk of myopathy. Statin-fibrate combination therapy must be undertaken cautiously and only after careful risk-benefit analysis. Patient counseling on the risks and warning signs of myopathy is extremely important.
Two girls aged 4 and 3 years, respectively, experienced acute liver failure due to accidental ingestion of supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol (90 mg/kg/day or more). Recognition of chronic paracetamol intoxication as a cause of acute hepatic failure is often delayed. It is important to consider the possibility of paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity because many patients will recover if treated with N-acetylcysteine, as did both of these children. Patients with acute liver failure due to chronic paracetamol intoxication present with very high transaminase levels (> 4000 U/l), disproportionately low total bilirubin levels (< 200 micromol/l) and often hypoglycaemia.
Anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction presenting with fever, skin eruptions, and internal organ involvement. We describe a case of AHS with fulminant hepatitis that occurred two weeks after introduction of lamotrigine in a 40-year-old female patient with a recently diagnosed bipolar disorder, no pre-existent systemic organ involvement, and no other medication. Lamotrigine was introduced at a dosage of 25 mg daily and increased to 50 mg daily 12 days later. The patient had favorable evolution with cessation of lamotrigine and supportive treatment. This report suggests that AHS with fulminant hepatitis may occur idiosyncratically, independent of dosage, titration and comedication with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs.
We investigated whether pair-feeding to prevent hyperphagia would potentiate the insulin-sensitizing effect of rosiglitazone in chow-fed and insulin-resistant dietary obese rats, and studied the role of leptin and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y as mediators of weight gain during treatment.
Dietary obese and chow-fed rats (575 +/- 10 vs. 536 +/- 7 g; p < 0.01) were given rosiglitazone (30 mg/kg p.o.) or vehicle daily for 14 days.
Energy intake and weight gain were greater in rosiglitazone-treated ad-lib-fed rats (body weight: chow + 24 +/- 2 g, rosiglitazone-treated + 55 +/- 2 g, p < 0.001; dietary obese + 34 +/- 2 g, rosiglitazone-treated + 74 +/- 7 g, p < 0.001). Half of each rosiglitazone-treated group were pair-fed to vehicle-treated controls. Rosiglitazone normalized circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) and insulin sensitivity in dietary obese rats (homeostasis model assessment (HOMA): chow-fed controls, 3.9 +/- 0.3; dietary obese controls, 6.7 +/- 0.7; rosiglitazone-treated, ad lib-fed dietary obese, 4.2 +/- 0.5; both p < 0.01). Insulin sensitivity improved further with pair-feeding (HOMA: 2.9 +/- 0.4; p < 0.05 vs. rosiglitazone-treated, ad lib-fed dietary obese), despite unchanged FFAs. Qualitatively similar findings were made in chow-fed rats. Pair-feeding prevented rosiglitazone-related weight gain in chow-fed, but not dietary obese rats (body weight: + 49 +/- 5 g, p < 0.001 vs. untreated dietary obese controls). Adipose tissue OB mRNA was elevated in dietary obese rats, reduced 49% (p < 0.01) by rosiglitazone treatment, and further (by 16%) with pair-feeding (p < 0.0001). Plasma leptin, however, only fell in the pair-fed group. Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y mRNA was unchanged throughout, suggesting that weight gain associated with high-dose rosiglitazone treatment is independent of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y.
Food restriction potentiates the insulin-sensitizing effect of rosiglitazone in rats, and this effect is independent of a fall in FFAs.
A novel family of G protein-coupled receptors, TAS2Rs, has recently been characterized and linked to sensitivity to bitter taste compounds. We have previously reported that a missense mutation in the TAS2R16 gene reduces the sensitivity of the receptor to bitter-taste stimuli and that it is associated with risk for alcohol dependence. Other family-based studies on the genetic transmittance of taste perception have previously demonstrated a correlation between genetic variation in TAS2R38 and sensitivity to bitter-taste compounds such as phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP). Haplotypes resulting from 3 common nonsynonymous coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TAS2R38 gene have been shown to alter receptor functions and taste sensitivity to PTC and PROP. The perceived bitterness of PROP has also been associated with oral sensation and drinking behaviors.
We used family-based association methods to test for association between TAS2R38 haplotypes and alcohol dependence as well as a measure of alcohol consumption (Maxdrinks) and age of onset of drinking behaviors in a sample of families densely affected with alcoholism. We have also extended our analysis of TAS2R16 to include the Maxdrinks phenotype.
A positive correlation was observed between TAS2R38 haplotypes and Maxdrinks in Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) high-risk women of African-American origin. The common taster haplotype is significantly associated with a lower mean Maxdrinks compared with the other haplotypes. Similarly, the allele of TAS2R16 that is associated with a lower risk for alcohol dependence is also associated with lower mean Maxdrinks scores in African-American families. In contrast to the previously reported significant association between TAS2R16 and alcohol dependence, we found no evidence that TAS2R38 haplotypes influence alcohol dependence in the COGA dataset.
Functional variants in both TAS2R16 and TAS2R38 correlate with alcohol consumption in African-American families.
Peripheral nerve injury can lead to a persistent neuropathic pain state in which innocuous tactile stimulation elicits pain behavior (tactile allodynia). Spinal administration of the anticonvulsant gabapentin suppresses allodynia by an unknown mechanism. In vitro studies indicate that gabapentin binds to the alpha(2)delta-1 (hereafter referred to as alpha(2)delta) subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. We hypothesized that nerve injury may result in altered alpha(2)delta subunit expression in spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and that this change may play a role in neuropathic pain processing. Using a rat neuropathic pain model in which gabapentin-sensitive tactile allodynia develops after tight ligation of the left fifth and sixth lumbar spinal nerves, we found a >17-fold, time-dependent increase in alpha(2)delta subunit expression in DRGs ipsilateral to the nerve injury. Marked alpha(2)delta subunit upregulation was also evident in rats with unilateral sciatic nerve crush, but not dorsal rhizotomy, indicating a peripheral origin of the expression regulation. The increased alpha(2)delta subunit expression preceded the allodynia onset and diminished in rats recovering from tactile allodynia. RNase protection experiments indicated that the DRG alpha(2)delta regulation was at the mRNA level. In contrast, calcium channel alpha(1B) and beta(3) subunit expression was not co-upregulated with the alpha(2)delta subunit after nerve injury. These data suggest that DRG alpha(2)delta regulation may play an unique role in neuroplasticity after peripheral nerve injury that may contribute to allodynia development.
Central haemodynamic changes and regional blood flow were studied using the microsphere technique, during labetalol-induced hypotension in dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbitone and fentanyl. Labetalol 15 mg kg-1 decreased mean arterial pressure from an average of 88 mm Hg to 47 mm Hg. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure was unchanged. Cardiac output was reduced by decrease in stroke volume, while heart rate remained unchanged. Myocardial blood flow decreased approximately in parallel with left ventricular work. Perfusion of the brain and kidneys was unchanged.
We report four cases of the side effects of minocycline seen during the last two years in our department. There was one case of drug-related lupus and three cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including one eosinophilic pneumopathy with pericarditis, one nephropathy and one severe, pseudo-infectious episode of high fever, rash, lympadenopathy, hepatitis and eosinophilia. Minocycline is a tetracycline agent widely used for acne therapy in France and all over the world. During the last few years, there has been an increasing number of reports concerning systemic adverse reactions to minocycline, with on the one hand auto-immune disorders (lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, vascularitis with ANCA), occurring after a prolonged course of therapy and reported recently in the last few years, and on the other hand, hypersensitivity reactions (eosinophilic pneumopathies, hepatitis, nephropathies, myocarditis, serum sickness or pseudo-infectious reactions), occurring precociously in the course of therapy, and potentially severe. Although these side effects are uncommon in the context of the high number of patients who have been prescribed the drug, the first-line antibiotic therapy in acne must probably be reconsidered.
Prenatal exposure to misoprostol has been associated with Moebius and limb defects. Vascular disruption has been proposed as the mechanism for these teratogenic effects. The present study is a multicenter, case-control study that was designed to compare the frequency of prenatal misoprostol use between mothers of Brazilian children diagnosed with vascular disruption defects and matched control mothers of children diagnosed with other types of defects. A total of 93 cases and 279 controls were recruited in eight participating centers. Prenatal exposure was identified in 32 infants diagnosed with vascular disruption defects (34.4%) compared with only 12 (4.3%) in the control group (P<0.0000001). Our data suggest that prenatal exposure to misoprostol is associated to the occurrence of vascular disruption defects in the newborns.
Temple-Baraitser syndrome (TBS) is a multisystem developmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, and hypoplasia or aplasia of the nails of the thumb and great toe. Here we report damaging de novo mutations in KCNH1 (encoding a protein called ether à go-go, EAG1 or KV10.1), a voltage-gated potassium channel that is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), in six individuals with TBS. Characterization of the mutant channels in both Xenopus laevis oocytes and human HEK293T cells showed a decreased threshold of activation and delayed deactivation, demonstrating that TBS-associated KCNH1 mutations lead to deleterious gain of function. Consistent with this result, we find that two mothers of children with TBS, who have epilepsy but are otherwise healthy, are low-level (10% and 27%) mosaic carriers of pathogenic KCNH1 mutations. Consistent with recent reports, this finding demonstrates that the etiology of many unresolved CNS disorders, including epilepsies, might be explained by pathogenic mosaic mutations.
Cervical artery dissection (CeAD), a mural hematoma in a carotid or vertebral artery, is a major cause of ischemic stroke in young adults although relatively uncommon in the general population (incidence of 2.6/100,000 per year). Minor cervical traumas, infection, migraine and hypertension are putative risk factors, and inverse associations with obesity and hypercholesterolemia are described. No confirmed genetic susceptibility factors have been identified using candidate gene approaches. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 1,393 CeAD cases and 14,416 controls. The rs9349379[G] allele (PHACTR1) was associated with lower CeAD risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.69-0.82; P = 4.46 × 10(-10)), with confirmation in independent follow-up samples (659 CeAD cases and 2,648 controls; P = 3.91 × 10(-3); combined P = 1.00 × 10(-11)). The rs9349379[G] allele was previously shown to be associated with lower risk of migraine and increased risk of myocardial infarction. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying this pleiotropy might provide important information on the biological underpinnings of these disabling conditions.
Propofol has the disadvantage of pain on injection. A higher partition of propofol in the aqueous phase of the preparation causes a higher incidence of pain on injection while addition of 1% lignocaine to propofol reduces pain. The low concentration of this local anaesthetic and the rapid pain relief observed indicates that mechanisms other than local anaesthesia are involved, that is change in pH. We performed a clinical study to investigate the influence of lignocaine and pH on pain during injection of 1% Diprivan. Ten parts of 1% Diprivan were mixed with one part of saline, 1% lignocaine or hydrochloric acid to achieve the same pH as that after addition of lignocaine. Diprivan 1% mixed with 1% lignocaine and with hydrochloric acid gave mean pain ratings (1-10) of 0.32 (SD 0.75) (n = 25) and 0.88 (1.30) (n = 24), respectively. These ratings were significantly lower than ratings after injection of a saline-Diprivan mixture (2.18 (2.06), n = 22). The pH of the 1% Diprivan formulation decreased after mixing with 1% lignocaine. The concentration of propofol in the aqueous phase was lower when 1% Diprivan was mixed with 1% lignocaine (0.376 g litre-1) or HCl (0.392 g litre-1) compared with 1% Diprivan and saline (0.476 g litre-1) mixed in the same proportion. Thus pH changes may modify propofol-induced pain on injection by a mechanism different from the effect of the local anaesthetic on the vascular endothelium. Our findings may explain why lignocaine mixed with propofol causes less pain than injection of lignocaine followed by propofol.
Although it is well established that the analgesic effects of morphine are mediated by opioid receptors, previous studies have shown that some opioids additionally inhibit the uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. The present investigation of a diverse group of opioids revealed that structurally identifiable subgroups inhibited the neuronal reuptake of these monoamines. Phenanthrene opioids with an oxygen bridge between C4 and C5, such as morphine and naloxone (group I), did not block norepinephrine or serotonin uptake, whereas phenanthrene opioids without the oxygen bridge and the C6-OH moiety, such as levorphanol and levomethorphan (group II), did inhibit uptake, as did nonphenanthrene opioids, such as d-propoxyphene and methadone (group III). Affinity at the mu opioid receptor correlated with antinociceptive potency (r = 0.87, P < .05). Although the antinociceptive activity of the "active enantiomers" of group II and III compounds also correlated with their affinity at the mu opioid receptor (r = 0.85, P = .007), additional consideration of serotonin uptake inhibiting activity (but not of norepinephrine uptake inhibiting activity) significantly improved the correlation between antinociceptive potency and the in vitro activity of these compounds (r = 0.915, P = .0017). Additionally, for group II and III (but not group I) compounds, smaller differences between enantiomers in antinociceptive potency than in mu receptor affinity were noted, presumably because of the contribution of uptake inhibition to the antinociceptive activity of group II and III compounds. Evidence also is provided suggesting a broader role for the combination of mu opioid affinity and 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake inhibition in the activity of other antinociceptive agents.
