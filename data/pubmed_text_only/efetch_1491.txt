Aminoglycosides have been used in the treatment of CAPD peritonitis despite their potential risk for ototoxicity. The ototoxicity risk of intraperitoneally administered aminoglycosides has been investigated by a number of studies. However, their results are somewhat conflicting. The aim of the present study was to examine the frequency of hearing loss and the correlation between the repeated doses of aminoglycosides and hearing loss in CAPD peritonitis therapy.
Hearing functions of the CAPD patients who had developed peritonitis and had been treated with various antibiotics including aminoglycosides were compared with those CAPD patients who had never developed peritonitis. Threshold values for hearing were determined through "pure tone audiometry" measurements.
Hearing threshold levels of the patients with history of peritonitis were found to be significantly higher in both lower [pure tone averages - 1 (PTA-1)] and higher [pure tone averages - 2 (PTA-2)] frequencies, when compared to the ones with no history of peritonitis (p values were 0.001 and 0.007, respectively).
The present study showed that intraperitoneal aminoglycoside administration in CAPD patients is associated with the development of hearing loss. The severity of hearing loss may range from mild hearing loss to profound deafness. A remarkable correlation exists between the severity of the hearing loss and the repeated and total aminoglycoside dose received.
Exposure to air pollution has been linked to pulmonary diseases. Naphthalene (NA), an abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in tobacco smoke and urban air, is a model toxicant for air pollution effects in the lung. Repeated exposures to NA in male mice result in tolerance, defined as the emergence of a resistant cell phenotype after prior exposure. Tolerance has not been studied in females. Females have sex differences in airway epithelial responses and in the prevalence of certain airway diseases. Male and female mice were exposed to a tolerance-inducing regimen of NA, and lungs were examined by airway level to characterize the cellular changes associated with repeated NA exposure and to assess the expression of genes and proteins involved in NA bioactivation and detoxification. The airway epithelium in treated males resembled that of controls. Females in the tolerant state were characterized by dense populations of ciliated cells in midlevel, distal, and bifurcating airways and a lower abundance of Clara cells at all airway levels. Cytotoxicity following a secondary challenge dose was also greater in females than males. Furthermore, females had decreased gene/protein expression of CYP2F2, a P-450 that metabolizes NA to a toxic epoxide, and glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis, than NA-tolerant males at all airway levels examined. We conclude that, while females develop tolerance, sex differences exist in the tolerant state by airway level, and females remain more susceptible than males to repeated exposures to NA.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have shown that common genetic variation contributes to the heritable risk of CLL. To identify additional CLL susceptibility loci, we conducted a GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with a published GWAS totaling 1,739 individuals with CLL (cases) and 5,199 controls with validation in an additional 1,144 cases and 3,151 controls. A combined analysis identified new susceptibility loci mapping to 3q26.2 (rs10936599, P = 1.74 × 10(-9)), 4q26 (rs6858698, P = 3.07 × 10(-9)), 6q25.2 (IPCEF1, rs2236256, P = 1.50 × 10(-10)) and 7q31.33 (POT1, rs17246404, P = 3.40 × 10(-8)). Additionally, we identified a promising association at 5p15.33 (CLPTM1L, rs31490, P = 1.72 × 10(-7)) and validated recently reported putative associations at 5p15.33 (TERT, rs10069690, P = 1.12 × 10(-10)) and 8q22.3 (rs2511714, P = 2.90 × 10(-9)). These findings provide further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to CLL.
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare and devastating cause of pulmonary hypertension that is characterized histologically by widespread fibrous intimal proliferation of septal veins and preseptal venules and is frequently associated with pulmonary capillary dilatation and proliferation. PVOD is categorized into a separate pulmonary arterial hypertension-related group in the current classification of pulmonary hypertension. PVOD presents either sporadically or as familial cases with a seemingly recessive mode of transmission. Using whole-exome sequencing, we detected recessive mutations in EIF2AK4 (also called GCN2) that cosegregated with PVOD in all 13 families studied. We also found biallelic EIF2AK4 mutations in 5 of 20 histologically confirmed sporadic cases of PVOD. All mutations, either in a homozygous or compound-heterozygous state, disrupted the function of the gene. These findings point to EIF2AK4 as the major gene that is linked to PVOD development and contribute toward an understanding of the complex genetic architecture of pulmonary hypertension.
Ten infants, 8 days to 10 months old, with meningitis and/or septicemia were considered therapeutic failures after conventional antibiotic treatment (i.e. kanamycin, ampicillin and sulfonamides) and given sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim parenterally. Nine patients recovered, 8 of them rapidly, and one after prolonged treatment for 34 days when kanamycin was added to the combination. One infant improved but later died of complications not related to the treatment. High concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were achieved with a daily dose of 30-40 mg sulphamethoxazole and 6-8 mg trimethoprim per kg without signs of accumulation. No change in resistance of the bacteria isolated was seen. A hemolytic reaction, probably due to the propylene glycol in the solution, was seen in one case. Other possible side-effects in this age-group are discussed. The antibiotic combination used seems to be a good alternative in the therapy of bacterial meningitis of infants caused by gram-negative bacteria. However it should still not be given to icteric or very immature infants and probably not during the first week of life.
We report a case that illustrates the risk of major, irreversible heart failure despite theoretically safe cumulative doses of adriamycin. We discuss risk factors for cardiotoxicity, predictive methods among which echocardiography is the most useful, and preventive measures. Data are still lacking concerning long term consequences on cardiac function. Until less cardiotoxic adriamycin derivatives become available, modifications in the treatment regimen can be proposed, including a tolerance test, lower doses approximating 20 mg per week instead of 60 mg every three weeks, and administration by continuous infusion through a deep catheter or a pump as cardiotoxicity seems more dependent on drug level peaks than on total dose. These measures should reduce the hazards of adriamycin, a drug that also has potent antimitotic properties.
We evaluate the protective role of simvastatin-induced HO-1 in remote preconditioning against testis ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in vivo. Simvastatin was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected 24 h before IR injury. Testis was occluded in the right testis for 40 min and followed by 30 min of reperfusion to induce IR injury. Tin protoporphyrin (Snpp), a competitive inhibitor of hemeoxygenase, was i.p. injected 1 h before the IR injury in separate groups of rats. The rat testes were harvested 24 h later. Induction of HO-1 expression by simvastatin was significantly increased at 24 and 48 h. Rats pre-treated with simvastatin showed higher expression of HO-1 protein by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and presented lower caspases-3 activity by caspase-3 activity assay. TUNEL staining analysis revealed simvastatin pretreatment significantly reduced IR induced cellular apoptosis. Contrarily, the simvastatin-induced cytoprotective effect was entirely abolished by administrations of Snpp. Further, lower caspase-3 activities were also noted in simvastatin plus Snpp (SS) group than the control plus Snpp (CS) group. After IR injury, eNOS immunoreactivity was markedly increased in the germ cell and Leydig cell of testicular tissues. Pretreatment of simvastatin significantly decreased eNOS immunoreactivity in the germ cell of the tubules in the rat testes. In conclusion, we suggest HO-1 plays a protective role in IR-induced injury in the testes of rats.
We report on 4 cases of urinary stone observed in patients treated with the drug Crixivan (Indinavir Sulfate) and review the literature. Comments include stone composition, clinical aspects, treatment and prevention.
Styrene exposure is highest among workers in the reinforced plastics industry with exposure seen for 5 consecutive days during the work week. Styrene is both hepatotoxic and pneumotoxic in mice, in addition to causing lung tumors. Human epidemiological studies are inconclusive as to the carcinogenicity of styrene so it is important to understand the mechanism responsible for styrene tumors in mice. Previous studies showed significant decreases in CC10 protein for 5 days following a single dose of the active metabolite R-styrene oxide (R-SO), yet little change in the bax/bcl-2 protein ratio was seen until 10 days following styrene or R-SO administration. Styrene or R-SO was given to CD-1 mice for 5 consecutive days. Mice were euthanized 24h, 10 days or 30 days following the last dose, and CC10, bax and bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels were determined in isolated Clara cells. CC10 mRNA levels were decreased at 24h for both styrene and R-SO. R-SO decreased CC10 protein levels up to 10 days following the last dose. Increases in the bax/bcl-2 mRNA and protein ratio were seen 24h following R-SO administration. Styrene did not significantly increase the bax/bcl-2 mRNA ratio until 10 days after treatment, with the bax/bcl-2 protein ratio increased at both 10 days and 30 days. It is likely that oxidative stress is involved in the toxicity caused by styrene and that minimal apoptosis may be involved. Chronically decreased CC10 levels may lead to increases in oxidative stress in Clara cells, the main target for styrene toxicity in the lung, and may be an early indicator for lung carcinogenesis in mice.
In the present study, compounds derived from the anticonvulsant drug valproic acid (VPA, 2-n-propylpentanoic acid) and analogues known to be teratogenic were synthesized with an additional carbon-branching in one of the side chains. The substances were tested for their ability to induce anticonvulsant activity and sedation in adult mice, and neural tube defects (exencephaly) in the offspring of pregnant animals (Han:NMRI mice). In all cases, the rates of exencephaly, embryolethality, and fetal weight retardation induced by the methyl-branched derivatives were very low when compared to those of the parent compounds. These novel compounds exhibited anticonvulsant activity which was not significantly different from that of VPA. Neurotoxicity was considerably lower for some compounds as compared to VPA. Anticonvulsant activity and neurotoxicity of branched short chain fatty acids are far less structure-dependent and not related to teratogenic potency. Within this series of compounds, (+/-)-4-methyl-2-n-propyl-4-pentenoic acid and (+/-)2-isobutyl-4-pentenoic acid exhibited the most favorable profile in regard to high anticonvulsant effect, low sedation, and teratogenicity. Valproic acid analogues with additional methyl branching may be valuable antiepileptic agents with low teratogenic potential.
This paper compares the pulmonary toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of three different types of poorly soluble dusts examined in repeated rat inhalation bioassays (6h/day, 5 days/week, 4 weeks). In these studies the fate of particles was studied during a 3-6-month postexposure period. This retrospective analysis included two types of aluminum oxyhydroxides (AlOOH, boehmite), high purity calcined, and agglomerated nanosized aluminas of very low solubility with primary isometric particles of 10 or 40nm, and synthetic iron oxide black (Fe(3)O(4) pigment grade). Three metrics of dose (actual mass concentration, surface area concentration, mass-based lung burden) were compared with pulmonary toxicity characterized by bronchoalveolar lavage. The results of this analysis provide strong evidence that pulmonary toxicity (inflammation) corresponds best with the mass-based cumulative lung exposure dose. The inhalation study with a MMAD of approximately 0.5microm yielded a higher pulmonary dose than MMADs in the range of 1-2microm, a range most commonly used in repeated exposure inhalation studies. Hence, a key premise for the dosimetric adjustment across species is that comparable lung tissue doses should cause comparable effects. From that perspective, the determination of mass-based pulmonary lung burdens appears to be amongst the most important and critical nominator of dose and dose-related pulmonary toxicity.
Microinjections of L-glutamate into the zona incerta of pentobarbital anesthetized rats caused decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. The bradycardic response was reduced by approximately 70% after i.v. administration of atropine methyl nitrate. After combined muscarinic and beta-adrenergic blockade the bradycardic response was reduced to 90% of the control value. This suggests that the bradycardia was mediated primarily by activating the vagal outflow. Blood pressure decreases elicited after pharmacological blockade of the heart with both atropine and timolol were approximately 50% of the control values. This indicates that the zona incerta is also capable of altering stroke volume and/or inhibiting the sympathetic outflow controlling the peripheral blood vessels. By using an injectate containing L-glutamate mixed with [3H]L-glutamate and subsequent analysis of autoradiographic tissue sections, we have determined that the most reactive site is the region of the ventral zona incerta.
The central nervous system depressant activity of the crude methanol extract (REC) and fractions (RE1, RE2, and RE3) of Russelia equisetiformis were evaluated in mice using the following models: amphetamine-induced stereotypy, picrotoxin-induced convulsion and phenobarbitone sleeping time. At 200-400 mg/kg, REC significantly increased phenobarbitone-sleeping time [P < 0.05] in a dose- dependent manner and also reduced the sleep latency significantly [P < 0.05]. The fractions, at doses 1.5 mg/kg for RE1 and 20 mg/kg for RE2 and RE3 also significantly prolonged Phenobarbitone sleeping time and sleep latency [P < 0.05]. Picrotoxin-induced convulsion was not prevented by 100-400 mg/kg of REC but this dose range significantly prolonged seizure latency. A significant reduction [P < 0.05] in amphetamine-induced stereotype behavior was observed with 200 mg/kg REC, but there was no protection against amphetamine-induced mortality. The results of this study suggest that Russelia equisetiformis methanol extract possesses central nervous system depressant activities.
A case of acute transmural anterior myocardial infarction in a 45-year-old Black employee of an explosives factory during a period of withdrawal from industrial nitroglycerin is documented. Angiography revealed that the patient had normal coronary arteries. Coronary vasospasm could not be induced by the ergometrine (ergonovine) maleate provocation test. It is postulated that the infarction was directly attributable to coronary vasospasm provoked by the 'industrial nitroglycerin withdrawal syndrome', since there was no evidence of any other non-atheromatous aetiological factor. The authors believe this to be the first such case in a Black subject reported in the literature.
Mutations of the gene SOD-1, which encodes the enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, occur in patients with a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We investigated 71 families with more than one individual affected by ALS for clinical features and SOD-1 mutations. Mutations were identified in 14 families, indicating the presence of SOD-1 mutations in around 20% of this population. There were 10 different heterozygote missense point mutations in eight different codons, and a novel two-base frameshift insertion (132insTT), which leads to substitution of aspartic acid for glutamic acid at codon 132, and a premature stop codon at 133, with predicted truncation of the protein. SOD enzyme activity was reduced to around 50% of normal in individuals with SOD-1 mutations, and may be a useful predictor for the presence of these mutations. A predilection for disease onset in the lower limbs appears to be a distinguishing feature of familial ALS with SOD-1 mutations, and accords with findings in transgenic mouse models. In general, the finding of an SOD-1 mutation does not accurately predict a prognosis or disease severity.
Although licorice is known to exert anticarcinogenic effects, it contains large quantities of glycyrrhizin (GL), which causes severe hypertension. We have previously demonstrated that the hexane/ethanol extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis (HEGU) contains no detectable GL and suppresses doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in H9c2 rat cardiac myoblasts. The principal objective of this study was to determine whether and by what mechanism HEGU and its active component, isoangustone A, inhibit cell-cycle progression in DU145 human prostate and 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells. HEGU and isoangustone A dose-dependently decreased DNA synthesis and induced G1 phase arrest in both DU145 and 4T1 cells. HEGU and isoangustone A reduced the levels of CDK2 and CDK4 as well as cyclin A and cyclin D1 proteins, and also induced a decrease in CDK2 activity. The addition of HEGU to drinking water significantly suppressed the orthotopic growth of 4T1 allografts and the expression of the proliferating nuclear cell antigen, CDK2 and CDK4 proteins in the tumor tissues. These results demonstrate the potential of HEGU containing isoangustone A as an antitumor agent.
Group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu II) receptors subtype 2 and 3 (mGlu2 and mGlu3) are subtle regulators of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. In recent years, researchers have investigated the potential neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects of compounds acting on mGlu II receptors. However, abnormal expression and function of mGlu2 and mGlu3 have been reported in temporal lobe epilepsy, a phenomena that may limit the therapeutic effectiveness of these potentially new antiepileptic drugs. Here, we investigated seizure-induced changes in mGlu2 and mGlu3 mRNA following pilocarpine-inducted status epilepticus (SE) and subsequent epileptogenesis. Relative changes in gene expression were assessed by comparative analysis of quantitative real-time PCR (qrtPCR) by the delta-delta CT method. Pilocarpine-treated and control rats were sacrificed at different periods (24 h, 10 days, one month and more than two months) following SE. Total RNA was isolated from microdissected dentate gyrus and processed for RT-PCR and qrtPCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an endogenous control gene. Analysis of relative quantification (RQ) ratios of mGlu2 and mGlu3 mRNA expression revealed a significant down-regulation of both targets at 24 h after SE. Gene expression partially recovered at 10 days following SE reaching control levels at one month after SE. Two month after SE, mGlu2 mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated to approximately 41% of control expression whereas mGlu3 mRNA was comparable to control levels. Our data indicate that mGlu2 and mGlu3 expression is dynamically down-regulated or selectively enhanced during critical periods of epileptogenesis. Seizure-induced differential dysregulation of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors may affect the availability of these molecular targets for therapeutic compounds in epilepsy.
Antagonism of the adenosine A(2a) receptor offers great promise in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In the course of exploring pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine A(2A) antagonists, which led to clinical candidate SCH 420814, we prepared 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidines with potent and selective (vs A(1)) A(2a) antagonist activity, including oral activity in the rat haloperidol-induced catalepsy model. Structure-activity relationships and plasma levels are described for this series.
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of statins and hormone therapy on submaximal exercise-induced coronary artery blood flow in postmenopausal women without a history of coronary artery disease. Hormone therapy or statin therapy in early postmenopausal women without coronary artery disease has been shown to enhance arterial endothelial function; we hypothesized that these agents would improve submaximal exercise-induced coronary artery blood flow.
Sixty-four postmenopausal women, aged 50 to 65 years without documented coronary artery disease, were randomized in a double-blind, crossover fashion to receive 8 weeks of hormone therapy versus placebo, with or without 80 mg/day of atorvastatin. Before receipt of any therapy and after each treatment period, each woman underwent measures of coronary artery blood flow at rest and stress.
The combination of hormone therapy and atorvastatin increased submaximal exercise-induced coronary artery blood flow (P = 0.04). In the subgroups of women compliant with treatment, resting coronary artery blood flow increased in those receiving hormone therapy (P = 0.03) or statin therapy (P = 0.02).
In postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years without documented coronary artery disease, resting and submaximal exercise-induced coronary artery blood flow improves after receipt of high-dose atorvastatin and conjugated estrogens therapy.
Anthracyclines are a group of drugs that are useful in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease, but have been associated with severe, and in some cases lethal, cardiac toxicity. Apparently, cardiac toxicity is more frequent after 10 years of anthracycline therapy, but no longer studies of cardiac toxicity have been reported. Four hundred and seventy-six patients with Hodgkin's disease, stages III and IV, were randomly assigned to receive ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) compared with EBVD (epirubicin instead of doxorubicin) and MBVD (mitoxantrone instead of doxorubicin) at standard doses. The endpoint was the presence of a clinical cardiac event (CCE) or abnormalities in equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography (ERNA) and echocardiogram. The patients did not receive radiation therapy and when relapsed they were censored from cardiac toxicity. The median follow-up was 11.5 years (range 7.5 - 14.8 years). CCE was observed in 17% in the MBVD arm, 9% in the ABVD arm and 6% in the EBVD arm (P < 0.001). Mortality associated with CCE was 12% with MBVD, 7% with ABVD and 2% with EBVD. Abnormalities in ERNA and echocardiogram were observed 6 - 36 months before the presence of a CCE. An excess in the standard mortality ratio was observed with the 3 regimens when compared with the general population: 19.4 for EBVD, 46.0 for ABVD and 67.8 for MBVD, which was confirmed with an increase in absolute excess risk/10,000 person-years of 15.6, 39.0 and 58.7, respectively. Overall survival was better in patients treated with EBVD because less cardiac events were observed. The use of mitoxantrone was associated with a high rate of relapse and cardiac events. Thus, we would not recommend use of the drug in Hodgkin's disease. ERNA and echocardiogram are early detection tests for cardiac toxicity and can be employed in surveillance studies.
Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria) is a rare neurometabolic disease caused by a deficiency in gamma-aminobutyric degradation, resulting in an increase in gamma-hydroxybutyric acid in biological fluids. The clinical spectrum is heterogeneous, including a variety of neurological manifestations and psychiatric symptoms. The treatment usually used is vigabatrin, but its clinical efficacy is under discussion. We present two affected siblings. The older brother was examined when he was 2.5 years old due to psychomotor and developmental delay, disturbances in motor coordination, axial hypotonia and language disability. His younger brother had mild axial hypotonia when 5 months old. Metabolic studies demonstrated a high plasma and urine concentration of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid. Mutation analysis of the gene ALDH5A1 confirmed the disease. After 1 year of treatment with low-doses of vigabatrin of the older patient, a decrease in gamma-hydroxybutyric acid plasma levels and a slow clinical improvement were observed.
The calcium sensitizer and PDEIII inhibitor EMD82571 caused exencephaly, micrognathia, agnathia and facial cleft in 58% of fetuses. In pursue of mechanisms and to define adverse outcome pathways pregnant Wistar rats were dosed daily with either EMD82571 (50 or 150mg/kg/day) or retinoic acid (12mg/kg/day) on gestational days 6-11 and 6-17, respectively. Hypothesis driven and whole genome microarray experiments were performed with whole embryo, maternal liver, embryonic liver and malformed bone at gestational days 12 and 20. This revealed regulation of genes critically involved in osteogenesis, odontogenesis, differentiation and development and extracellular matrix. Importantly, repression of osteocalcin and members of TGF-β/BMP signaling hampered osteo- and odontogenesis. Furthermore, EMD82571 impaired neurulation by inhibiting mid hinge point formation to cause neural tube defects. Taken collectively, a molecular rationale for the observed teratogenicity induced by EMD82571 is presented that links molecular initiating events with AOPs.
We sought to examine how the discontinuation of octreotide in long-term octreotide-treated acromegalic patients affects the well-documented side-effect of cholelithiasis. In 14 acromegalic patients, serum growth hormone levels, insulin-like growth factor I levels and percentage of relative gallbladder contractility were measured prior to and after the discontinuation of octreotide. Compared to pretreatment values, the basal growth hormone and 5-h growth hormone profiles were 36% and 24%, and 60% and 56% at the end of 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. Octreotide was found to be eliminated completely from the serum within 3 days after its withdrawal. In all of six patients who did not develop gallstones, the percentage relative gallbladder contractility normalized within 1 week. In eight patients who developed gallstones, four of them had restoration of normal contractility within 2 weeks. Our results show that upon withdrawal of octreotide, gallbladder contractility returns to normal while growth hormone suppression persists for a longer period of time. Therefore, discontinuation of octreotide therapy may allow for the clearance of stagnated bile and hence decrease the incidence of cholelithiasis in acromegalic patients receiving long-term therapy.
Dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2 or DPYSL-2)mediates the intracellular response to collapsin, a repulsive extracellular guidance cue or axonal outgrowth. DRP-2 is also referred to as collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2). We have previously demonstrated that the DRP-2 gene is associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia, but not to bipolar disorders. In addition, a genetic association was observed with paranoid-type schizophrenia, but not with hebephrenic-type schizophrenia. It has been well documented that repeated abuse of methamphetamine (METH) for a long period frequently produces psychotic symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions that are hardly distinguishable from those of paranoid-type schizophrenia. Therefore, we hypothesized that a certain genetic variant of the DRP-2 gene may affect individual vulnerability to the development of METH-induced psychosis. We examined the genetic association by a case-control method. The polymorphism *2236T>C in the 3' untranslated region of the DRP-2 gene, which has been shown to be a negative genetic risk factor for paranoid-type schizophrenia, was analyzed in 198 patients with METH psychosis and 221 corresponding healthy controls in a Japanese population. No significant association of the DRP-2 gene with METH psychosis was found. Neither did we find an association with the clinical phenotype of METH psychosis, such as the age of first consumption of METH, latency to development of psychosis after METH abuse, prognosis of psychosis after detoxification from METH use, complication of spontaneous relapse of psychosis without reconsumption of the drug, or multisubstance abuse status. These findings indicate that a genetic variant of the DRP-2 gene may not affect the risk of METH psychosis or any clinical phenotype of the disorder.
