Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (WICH) became more frequent in the past 2 decades. Interest in potential WICH treatment trials has grown, but the practicality of such trials has received less attention. We determined the number of patients that would be eligible for enrollment in hypothetical treatment trials for WICH using a population-based study.
We identified all patients aged 18 years or older from the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage in 2005. Three hypothetical WICH treatment trial criteria sets were used to determine eligibility for enrollment, varying from relatively strict to broadly inclusive. For the hypothetical trials, we assumed the comparison of a standard therapy to an alternative therapy. Sample size calculations assumed different rates of poor outcome depending on the criteria set, various effect sizes, a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, and 80% power. Given 5 years of trial enrollment, the population base needed to enroll the required subjects was then calculated.
Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage accounted for 54 of 286 (19%) cases of intracerebral hemorrhage within the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region in 2005. Eligibility rates ranged from 2 of 54 WICH patients (4% of cases, strictest set) to 11 of 54 WICH patients (20% of cases, most inclusive set). Given these rates, a population base of at least 67 million persons would be required to conduct a 5-year trial for WICH with a 10% effect size using a moderately strict criteria set.
Any planned treatment trial for WICH should anticipate significant challenges in successfully enrolling adequate numbers of patients.
Foci of altered hepatocytes are preneoplastic lesions capable of progressing to hepatocellular carcinomas. To characterize the growth of preneoplastic hepatic lesions, size of hepatic foci was analyzed with regard to growth factor regulation and hepatocyte proliferation in focal and non-focal hepatocytes. Twelve-day-old female B6C3F1 mice were initiated with a single dose of the potent mutagen N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) (5 mg/kg body weight). Beginning at 6 weeks of age, mice were exposed for 16 weeks to 2038 p.p.m. unleaded gasoline (UG) vapor or 1 p.p.m. ethinyl estradiol (EE) in the diet. Analysis of hepatic foci demonstrated that UG significantly increased, but EE significantly decreased the size of DEN-initiated foci. Hepatic labeling index (LI), as measured by the incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, was similar in non-focal hepatocytes at 16 weeks in all groups (0.4-0.8%) and greatly increased in hepatic foci. Hepatocyte LI was significantly increased in DEN/UG foci (29%, n = 41) and significantly decreased in DEN/EE foci (6%, n = 23) relative to DEN/control focal hepatocytes (18%, n = 25). The mean LI of foci correlated with the focal size differences observed in the treatment groups. Immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies directed to the negative growth regulator transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) demonstrated a consistent decrease of TGF-beta 1 in DEN/Ct and DEN/UG hepatic foci relative to non-lesion hepatocytes. Similar results were seen with mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (M6P/IGF-II R), which facilitates activation of latent TGF-beta 1. In contrast, only 50% of DEN/EE foci had decreased levels of TGF-beta 1 and M6P/IGF-II R relative to non-focal hepatocytes. These data suggest that proliferative responses observed in hepatic foci may be correlated with foci size. In contrast, chemically induced proliferative responses in non-focal hepatocytes after subchronic exposure cannot necessarily be used to predict proliferative effects in preneoplastic cell populations. Furthermore, these studies suggest that hepatic foci may occur by M6P/IGF-II R enhancing activation of latent TGF-beta 1 in non-focal hepatocytes but not in the focal hepatocytes, thereby affording focal hepatocytes a selective growth advantage.
In this review, we discuss the role of nitric oxide synthase in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, a prominent side effect of DOX chemotherapy in cancer patients. It is becoming increasingly clear that apoptosis of myocardial cells plays a critical role in the onset of cardiomyopathy. DOX exposure to endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes caused apoptotic cell death at sub-micromolar concentrations. DOX-induced generation of H2O2 has been shown to be responsible for this drug's toxicity and apoptosis. H2O2 in turn enhanced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) transcription in endothelial cells and myocytes. Antisense eNOS depressed DOX-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. Redox-metal chelators inhibited DOX-induced apoptosis, clearly suggesting a role for reactive oxygen species in DOX-induced apoptosis. Here, we will focus on the role of eNOS expression, iron chelation, and iron signaling on DOX-mediated apoptosis.
A 45-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer presented to a hospital emergency department in an acute confusional state, with blurred vision and mild headache. Following progressively increasing lethargy, she subsequently became unresponsive to tactile and verbal stimuli. She had recently been started on chemotherapy with carboplatin and gemcitabine.

Withholding of chemotherapeutic agents, and antiseizure therapy for the status epilepticus.
When patients with schizophrenia fail to respond to an atypical antipsychotic, they are sometimes switched to another atypical compound. However, the benefits of such a switch have not been adequately studied. We present an open-label prospective 14-week trial with olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder whose treatment resistance to clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol had been determined prospectively.
The subjects were 45 inpatients with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who failed to respond to treatment during a 14-week double-blind trial comparing clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol. The patients had been selected for participation in the double-blind trial on the basis of a history of suboptimal response to previous treatment. Inclusion criteria for the present study were (1) completion of at least 8 weeks of the 14-week double-blind trial, (2) treatment resistance to 1 of the 4 compounds tested as evidenced by a decrease in total PANSS score of less than 20%, and (3) total PANSS score > or = 60. Subjects were cross-titrated from the previous double-blind treatment to open-label olanzapine, 10 to 40 mg/day, and were treated for 14 weeks without concomitant psychotropic medication. Patients were evaluated weekly with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impressions scale, and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale.
Open-label olanzapine treatment yielded no significant change in PANSS total, positive subscale, or negative subscale scores. There was a significant improvement for the PANSS cognitive factor (mean +/- SD change = 0.92 +/- 2.27; F = 7.5, df = 1,44; p <.009) and a marginally significant worsening for the excitement factor (mean change = -1.36 +/- 4.64; F = 4.0, df = 1,44; p < .053). Nine percent of patients (N = 4) were classified as responders using the Kane et al. criteria. The worsening in the PANSS excitement factor was significantly associated with the length of illness (t = -2.10, df = 44, p < .04). There was a nonsignificant decrease in extrapyramidal side effects and a significant increase in weight (mean increase = 3.5 +/- 6.2 kg [7.8 +/- 13.8 lb]; F = 5.29, df = 1,42; p <.0005).
Our results indicate that in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, a switch to olanzapine after treatment failure with an atypical agent or haloperidol may not reduce psychopathology in general, but may improve symptoms related to cognitive function.
We used genetically heterogeneous HS mice to investigate the effects of drugs that alter brain concentrations of serotonin on cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality. The racemer of fenfluramine, which increases synaptic serotonin, was coadministered with a dose (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) of cocaine that does not produce status epilepticus or death. This drug combination significantly increased the occurrence and decreased the time of onset of status epilepticus, but did not affect lethality. Likewise, 2.5 mg/kg of the D-isomer, of fenfluramine increased the occurrence of status epilepticus. Neither isomer effected lethality. When 2.5 mg/kg cinanserin, a drug that antagonizes postsynaptic serotonergic receptors, was coadministered with a higher (95 mg/kg) dose of cocaine, the time of onset of status epilepticus was significantly increased, whereas lethality was reduced. The results are discussed in light of the action of cocaine upon serotonin neurons and the relationship between seizurogenic activity and cocaine-induced lethality.
Prior studies have found that antidepressant medications are associated with an increased risk of falling in elderly persons. However, little is known about the prevention of falls during treatment for depression in elderly persons. This study evaluated the time course and potential risk factors for falls in a treatment protocol for late-life depression to identify specific at-risk periods and risk factors for falls in this population.
One hundred four subjects aged 69 years and over were treated in a protocolized manner using paroxetine and interpersonal psychotherapy. Those who did not respond received augmentation therapy with bupropion, nortriptyline, or lithium. Subjects were assessed at baseline and weekly during treatment; demographic and clinical characteristics of those who experienced a fall during treatment were compared with those who did not fall. Cox proportional hazards models were used to define risk factors for falls in univariate and multivariate models.
During a mean of 21 weeks of treatment, 40 subjects (38%) fell. About half (53%) of the subjects fell during the first 6 weeks of treatment. In the multivariate model, memory impairment and orthostatic changes in blood pressure during treatment were risk factors for falling. Additionally, augmentation with bupropion appeared to be a risk factor for falls in univariate analysis, but this result is preliminary due to the small number of subjects who took bupropion.
Increased monitoring for falls is warranted during the acute treatment of late-life depression. When treating such patients, clinicians should be especially watchful of those with memory impairments or those who develop orthostatic blood pressure changes; orthostatic blood pressure should be measured throughout acute treatment. Additionally, augmenting paroxetine with bupropion may also increase the risk of falls, and this medication combination should be used with caution in elderly patients.
Basal levels of c-Src kinase are known to regulate smooth muscle Ca(2+) channels. Colonic inflammation results in attenuated Ca(2+) currents and muscle contraction. Here, we examined the regulation of calcium influx-dependent contractility by c-Src kinase in experimental colitis. Ca(2+)-influx induced contractions were measured by isometric tension recordings of mouse colonic longitudinal muscle strips depolarized by high K(+). The E(max) to CaCl(2) was significantly less in inflamed tissues (38.4 +/- 7.6%) than controls, indicative of reduced Ca(2+) influx. PP2 [4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine], a selective Src kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced the contractile amplitude and shifted the pD(2) from 3.88 to 2.44 in controls, whereas it was ineffective in inflamed tissues (3.66 versus 3.43). After pretreatment with a SIN-1 (3-morpholinosydnonimine)/peroxynitrite combination, the maximal contraction to CaCl(2) was reduced by 46 +/- 7% in controls but unaffected in inflamed tissues (13 +/- 11%). Peroxynitrite also prevented the inhibitory effect of PP2 in control tissues. In colonic single smooth muscle cells, PP2 inhibited Ca(2+) currents by 84.1 +/- 3.9% in normal but only 36.2 +/- 13% in inflamed tissues. Neither the Ca(2+) channel Ca(v)1.2b, gene expression, nor the c-Src kinase activity was altered by inflammation. Western blot analysis showed no change in the Ca(2+) channel protein expression but increased nitrotyrosylated-Ca(2+) channel proteins during inflammation. These data suggest that post-translational modification of Ca(2+) channels during inflammation, possibly nitrotyrosylation, prevents c-Src kinase regulation resulting in decreased Ca(2+) influx.
The protective effect of triamterene was demonstrated on aconitine (rats) and strophanthin (cats) models of arrhythmias. Furosemide potentiates the antiarrhythmic effects of calcium chloride (rats) and strophanthin, ethacrynic acid potentiates the arrhythmogenic action of all agents used.
We present the case of a 77-year-old woman who initially presented with pyrexia of unknown origin, anaemia and mild renal impairment. When her omeprazole was stopped she improved rapidly. When omeprazole was re-started she developed fever and acute renal failure, which again settled quickly on discontinuation of omeprazole. This case demonstrates how drugs can cause severe multisystem disorders that may appear to be infective or inflammatory.
In this study, the memory and learning impairment induced by dexamethasone in young mice and senescent mice were evaluated by step-down inhibitory avoidance task and passive avoidance test. Colorimetric MTT(tetrazole 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and TUNEL staining were used to investigate the influence of dexamethasone on hippocampal neuronal cell death with amyloid beta-protein. It was determined the effect of dexamethasone on intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) with amyloid beta-protein 25-35 by fluorescence imaging with a confocal laser microscope using fluo-3 acetoxymethylester (AM) as a fluorescent dye. The effect of dexamethasone on amyloid beta-protein 25-35-induced nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) was analyzed by western blot. The results showed that twenty one days dexamethasone exposure resulted in an impairment of memory and learning in senescent but not young mice. Pretreatment of isolated hippocampal neurons with dexamethasone increased the vulnerability of the hippocampal neurons to amyloid beta-protein 25-35, enhanced [Ca(2+)](i) and down-regulated the increased level of nuclear NF-kappaB p65 proteins induced by amyloid beta-protein 25-35. These results demonstrated that glucocorticoids could potentiate the neurotoxic action of amyloid beta-protein by further increasing the level of [Ca(2+)](i) and down-regulating the level of nuclear NF-kappaB protein. Since amyloid beta-protein increases in the brain with aging, glucocorticoids potentiation of the neurotoxic action of amyloid beta-protein maybe one of the mechanisms responsible for glucocorticoids-induced memory and learning impairment in senescent but not young mice, which maybe relevance to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.
Our purpose was to quantitate the risk of perinatal thyroid dysfunction and other amiodarone-induced adverse effects among infants exposed in utero to amiodarone.
A historic cohort study of gestational exposure to amiodarone was conducted by contacting Canadian cardiac electrophysiologists.
Twelve cases were identified. Of six with first-trimester exposure, one child had congenital nystagmus with synchronous head titubation. There was one case each of transient neonatal hypothyroidism (9%) and hyperthyroidism (9%). A fourth child, exposed to amiodarone from 20 weeks' gestation, had developmental delay, hypotonia, hypertelorism, and micrognathia. Four small-for-gestational-age infants were also exposed to beta-blockers, which in addition to maternal cardiac disease, have been recognized to cause growth restriction. beta-Blockers may also have contributed to bradycardia in one of the three fetuses in whom this was observed.
Gestational exposure to amiodarone may be complicated by perinatal hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and possibly neurologic abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation or fetal bradycardia. Concomitant beta-blocker therapy should probably be avoided. Full neonatal thyroid function tests and developmental follow-up are recommended.
Azacitidine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and cytotoxic agent known to induce apoptosis of some cancer cells. This study evaluated the pre-clinical potential of azacitidine as a therapeutic agent for multiple myeloma.
Dose responsiveness to azacitidine was determined utilizing a panel of genetically heterogenous human multiple myeloma cell lines. Azacitidine was also tested against primary multiple myeloma cells and in the 5T33MM murine model of systemic myelomatosis. Mechanistic studies included immunoblotting of key apoptosis signaling proteins, analysis of p16 gene methylation status, and characterization of both the interleukin-6 and nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathways following azacitidine treatment.
Human myeloma cell lines and primary multiple myeloma cells underwent apoptosis following exposure to clinically achievable concentrations of azacitidine (1 microM-20 microM). Similarly, azacitidine prolonged survival from 24.5 days to 32 days (p=0.001, log rank) in the 5T33MM model. At a mechanistic level azacitidine down-regulated two crucial cell survival pathways in multiple myeloma. First, it inhibited the elaboration of both interleukin-6 receptor-alpha and interleukin- 6 resulting in the reduced expression of both phospho-STAT3 and Bcl-xl. Secondly, azacitidine inhibited both nuclear factor-kappaB nuclear translocation and DNA binding in a manner independent of IkappaB. The kinetics of these azacitidine-induced responses was more consistent with protein synthesis inhibition than with either hypomethylation or another DNA-mediated effect.
Azacitidine rapidly induces apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells, is effective in vivo against multiple myeloma and inhibits two crucial cell survival pathways in this disease. We conclude that azacitidine demonstrates novel and highly relevant anti-myeloma effects and warrants further evaluation in a clinical context.
A 68-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of angina and ventricular tachyarrhythmia. A coronary and left ventricular angiography showed coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction. A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed successfully in the right coronary artery and his angina symptoms disappeared. However, ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred spontaneously and converted to sinus rhythm with direct current shock (300 J). Oral amiodarone (200 mg/day) and continuous intravenous infusion of nifekalant and lidocaine were started. In addition, a dual chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for his VT/VF was implanted. However, VT/VF occurred repeatedly after discontinuation of nifekalant. After the administration of bepridil (200 mg/day), VT/VF was completely prevented without nifekalant administration. The hybrid therapy with ICD and oral bepridil is very useful for the treatment of amiodarone resistant ventricular tachyarrhythmia.
The insecticides lindane and permethrin are commonly used for treatment of scabies. Animal studies have shown the presence of insecticide induced oxidative stress. Hence, this study was undertaken to assess and compare the effects of topical application of lindane and permethrin on oxidative stress parameters in scabies patients.
Patients were alternatively assigned to treatment by either 1% lindane lotion or 5% permethrin cream. Blood samples were collected before and 12-14 h after the application of the drugs and evaluated for oxidative stress parameters and compared with healthy controls.
Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity were significantly increased while blood glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly decreased in the lindane group as compared to controls and the permethrin group. The permethrin treated group showed a non significant alteration in the oxidative stress parameters.
Topical application of lindane induced significant oxidative stress as compared to permethrin which appears to be a safer option for the treatment of scabies.
An approach using microwave-assisted derivatization (MAD) following solid-phase extraction (SPE) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed to determine amphetamines in urine samples. The parameters affecting the derivatization efficiency - including microwave power and irradiation time - were investigated. Besides, solvent is thought critically important to MAD. Derivatization performance was studied using various solvents and compared with the performance obtained without solvent. Derivatization efficiency was clearly found to be enhanced by the presence of solvent. The highest derivatization efficiencies were obtained in ethyl acetate (EA) under microwave power of 250W for 1min. Calibration curves for all amphetamines were linear over a range from 1 to 1000ng/mL, with correlation coefficients above 0.9992. The intra-day and inter-day precision were less than 15%. The applicability of the method was tested by analyzing amphetamine-abusing subjects urine samples. Accordingly, the solvent-enhanced MAD-GC-MS method appears to be adequate for determining amphetamines in urine.
Our laboratory has shown that troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione and peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, prevents mesangial expansion and glomerulosclerosis in diabetic rats. We investigated and compared the action of two PPAR agonists at the level of the mesangial cell.
Rat mesangial cells were grown in medium containing 5 mmol/L glucose, 30 mmol/L glucose, or 5 mmol/L glucose plus 25 mmol/L mannitol. The cultures were either left untreated, treated with 10 micromol/L troglitazone (PPAR-gamma), or 100 micromol/L clofibrate (PPAR-alpha). The following parameters were used to assess mesangial cell responses: detection of PPAR-gamma and -alpha mRNA, the degree of PPAR-gamma and -alpha activation, spread cell area, total protein production, and laminin and type I collagen production.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed the presence of PPAR-gamma and -alpha mRNA in rat mesangial cells. PPAR-gamma and -alpha proteins are active in mesangial cells and the extent of activation is affected by different glycemic conditions. Troglitazone and clofibrate treatment corrected in part the increase in spread cell area seen in mesangial cells in hyperglycemic conditions. However, neither agonist corrected the increase in total protein production induced by hyperglycemia. Treatment with troglitazone resulted in a significant, specific decrease in type I collagen along with a slight decrease in laminin production in both medium conditions. Clofibrate had no effect on laminin synthesis in either medium condition but did decrease type I collagen synthesis in cells grown in hyperglycemic conditions.
PPAR-alpha and -gamma mRNA signaling pathways are in place and active in mesangial cells. Both agonists affect the phenotypic behavior of mesangial cells and ameliorate changes resulting from hyperglycemia. The data indicate that the correction of mesangial cell phenotype by troglitazone may influence production/deposition of a pathological fibrotic connective tissue matrix (that is, type I collagen) by these cells.
A collaborative retrospective study undertaken to investigate cardiac arrest related to pediatric anesthesia in seven institutions between 1960 and 1972 showed 73 instances in which anesthesia was thought to have been either directly responsible or had played an important contributing role. About two thirds of these patients were successfully resuscitated. Cases were found to fit into one of two major categories: cardiovascular and respiratory. Among cardiovascular factors, blood loss, preoperative anemia, inappropriate administration of succinylcholine, and accidental administration of potassium were important contributing causes. Respiratory factors included failure to maintain a patent airway and ventilatory problems. In retrospect, most of these accidents were preventable. Such information should indicate where research emphasis needs to be placed and that our current methods of teaching and training need to be reevaluated.
Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were measured during intra-aortic arch (i.a.a.), intravenous, and suprarenal artery (s.r.a.) infusions of adenosine in conscious, unrestrained normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in the absence and presence of ganglionic blockade. In both groups, i.a.a. and i.v. infusions of adenosine induced comparatively larger dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial pressure than did s.r.a. infusions. In WKY, i.a.a. and i.v. infusions of adenosine were equipotent in reducing mean arterial pressure. In contrast, i.a.a. infusion of adenosine was approximately twice as potent as i.v. infusion in SHR. Also, SHR were approximately 6.5 and 2.6 times more sensitive to i.a.a. and i.v. infusions of adenosine, respectively, than were WKY. Further, i.a.a. and s.r.a. infusions of adenosine caused tachycardia in WKY, while i.v. infusions did not alter heart rate. In SHR, neither i.a.a. nor s.r.a. infusion of adenosine altered heart rate, but i.v. infusion induced a profound bradycardia. In ganglionic-blocked WKY that received a norepinephrine infusion to restore blood pressure and heart rate to pre-ganglionic blockade levels, depressor responses to i.a.a. infusion of adenosine were unchanged while the increase in heart rate was abolished. In SHR, ganglionic blockade markedly decreased the depressor response to i.a.a. and i.v. infusions of adenosine and abolished the bradycardic response to i.v. infusion. These results suggest that adenosine is an effective hypotensive agent in both WKY and SHR; however, marked between-strain differences exist in the cardiovascular response to adenosine. These differences most likely are due to changes in adenosine-pulmonary interactions and increases in the importance of adenosine-autonomic interactions in SHR.
beta-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations cause familial Alzheimer's disease with nearly complete penetrance. We found an APP mutation [alanine-673-->valine-673 (A673V)] that causes disease only in the homozygous state, whereas heterozygous carriers were unaffected, consistent with a recessive Mendelian trait of inheritance. The A673V mutation affected APP processing, resulting in enhanced beta-amyloid (Abeta) production and formation of amyloid fibrils in vitro. Co-incubation of mutated and wild-type peptides conferred instability on Abeta aggregates and inhibited amyloidogenesis and neurotoxicity. The highly amyloidogenic effect of the A673V mutation in the homozygous state and its anti-amyloidogenic effect in the heterozygous state account for the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and have implications for genetic screening and the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Aggressive rats could be differentiated from non-aggressive rats on a lower rate of rearing reactions in the open-field activity, as well as on a weaker aptitude for learning, increasing with the complication of the test. The two groups of rats had comparable activity, and a comparable response to pain. Apomorphine decreased the number of rearing reactions and defecations on open-field activity in the same manner in non-aggressive rats as in aggressive animals. In the usual housing conditions, apomorphine increased similarly locomotor activity in both groups, but in observation cages of "emotional" type, the increase was much more pronounced in aggressive rats than in non-aggressive animals.
One calf was infected with bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) and mixed with five other calves, of which one had been vaccinated with a BHV-1 modified live vaccine one month earlier. The other four calves were vaccinated at the time the experimentally infected calf developed the first signs of the disease (fever, depression, nasal discharge), i.e. on post infection day (PID) 2. In addition to the vaccine, two of the four PID 2 vaccinated calves also received a non-specific defence (NSD) inducer (Baypamun, Bayer AG) at the same time as the vaccine. The calf that was vaccinated 1 month before the start of the experiment, as expected, did not show any signs of the disease. Of the remaining four, the two vaccine-only calves experienced a classical form of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. However, the two calves that had also received the NSD inducer remained generally healthy during the entire observation period of 30 days. It was speculated that the use of a NSD inducer once an outbreak of a respiratory disease has started on a farm could be of significant help in an emergency in reducing the clinical manifestations in those animals that may subsequently be infected.
We have evaluated the dose-, schedule-, and time-dependent effects of doxorubicin (DXR) on the rat electrocardiogram (ECG) and have related ECG alterations to cellular transmembrane potential (TMP) changes and ultrastructural changes in preparations isolated from DXR-treated animals. DXR was administered intraperitoneally at 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg (all five times per week) or 5 mg/kg once per week up to a cumulative dose of 20 mg/kg, or 2 mg/kg daily for 5 days for a cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg. Posttreatment deaths were due to acute toxicity (bone marrow suppression) or congestive cardiomyopathy (8-14 weeks after the end of dosing). The most consistent ECG changes observed with DXR treatment (greater than 10 mg/kg cumulative dose) were a reversible prolongation of the QRS complex and a progressive lengthening of the Q alpha T interval; changes in R-, S-, and T-wave voltages were more variable. ECG toxicity was more pronounced when the drug was given on a weekly schedule. On the cellular level, DXR treatment led to a decrease in Vmax, with a slight increase or no change in resting potential, and a marked prolongation in action potential duration at the 50% and 75% repolarization levels. The ECG and TMP changes were accompanied by ultrastructural changes that increased in severity during the posttreatment period. Our data further support the usefulness of the rat ECG in anthracycline cardiotoxicity studies.
This randomized phase II study was designed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of dacarbazine (DTIC) and bleomycin, vincristine, lomustine and DTIC (BOLD) combined with natural interferon-alpha (nIFN-alpha) or recombinant interferon-alpha2b (rIFN-alpha2b) in patients with advanced melanoma. The treatment arms were: A, DTIC plus nIFN-alpha; B, BOLD plus nIFN-alpha; C, DTIC plus rIFN-alpha2b; D, BOLD plus rIFN-alpha2b. One hundred and eight patients were randomized, of whom 106 were eligible to be analysed for efficacy. Overall, 56% of patients had abdominal visceral and/or bone involvement. The response rates were 8% (2/25) in arm A, 13% (4/31) in arm B, 12% (3/25) in arm C and 24% (6/25) in arm D. The differences were not statistically significant by the usual chi-squared test. However, when analysed using the Cochran-Armitage trend test, the one-sided P values were close to significant (0.085 and 0.033). All of the eight complete responses occurred in patients with soft tissue and/or lung metastases and the BOLD regimens produced six of them. There were no significant differences in survival (arm A, 11.1 months; arm B, 9.8 months; arm C, 9.1 months; arm D, 7.5 months; P=0.62). BOLD was more toxic than DTIC. With the present sample size, there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between the arms, but there was a trend towards a higher response rate with BOLD plus rIFN-alpha2b. Patients with soft tissue or lung metastases may achieve more complete responses with BOLD regimens.
Nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine (NNLA) produced dose-dependent, long-lasting catalepsy in rats, the effect being attenuated by NO donors L-arginine and molsidomine. Catalepsy induced by haloperidol (0.4 mg/kg i.p.), D2 receptor antagonist, was reduced dose-dependently by molsidomine (10.0-100.0 mg/kg) and by L-arginine at a dose of 100.0 mg/kg. Low, non-cataleptic doses of NNLA (0.1 mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) given in combination produced a marked and long-lasting catalepsy. The results suggest that NO plays a role in NNLA-induced catalepsy as well as in catalepsy elicited by haloperidol.
