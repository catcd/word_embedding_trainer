Cataracts are a significant public health problem. Here, we describe the genetic alteration responsible for a progressive form of cataract, segregating as an autosomal dominant trait in a three-generation pedigree. Unlike most autosomal dominant cataracts, these are not clinically apparent at birth but are initially observed in the first year or two of life. The opacification evolves relatively slowly, generally necessitating removal of the lens in childhood or early adolescence. A genome-wide search in our kindred revealed linkage at 2q33-35 where the gamma-crystallin gene cluster resides. A single base alteration resulting in an Arg- 14 --> Cys (R14C) substitution in gammaD-crystallin was subsequently identified. Protein modeling suggests that the effect of this mutation is a subtle one, affecting the surface properties of the crystallin molecule rather than its tertiary structure, consistent with the fact that the patients' lenses are normal at birth. This is the first gene defect shown to be responsible for a noncongenital progressive cataract, and studying the defective protein should teach us more about the mechanisms underlying cataract formation.
To compare curcumin with hydrocortisone for treating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (BLMPF), four groups of rats were injected with 1.5 mg/kg bleomycin intratracheally. Then the Group HC rats were treated with three injections of 2mg/kg hydrocortisone i.p.; Group CH and CL rats, respectively, were orally given 500 or 250 mg/kg curcumin daily; and Group PC rats were given deionized water alone. After 28 days of treatment, lung samples were examined by H-E staining, Masson's staining and immunohistochemical analyses and pulmonary type I collagen (Col-I), inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) were determined by Western blotting and real-time RT PCR analyses. The results showed that (1) Group PC rats had histopathological characteristics of BLMPF with significant increase in their protein/mRNA expressions of Col-I (+114%/+173%), iNOS (+146%/+523%) and TGF-beta1 (+476%/+527%) (P<0.01); (2) in Group HC, CH and CL rats, protein/mRNA expressions of Col-I (-39%/-52%, -31%/-57%, -33%/-58%), iNOS (-31%/-51%, -31%/-79%, -31%/-47%) and TGF-beta1 (-64%/-78%, -75%/-74%, -81%/-79%) were significantly lower than Group PC (P<0.05); (3) except for levels of TGF-beta1 protein, there was no significant difference among Group CH, CL and HC rats (P>0.05). It suggests that curcumin may play a similar role as hydrocortisone in preventing BLMPF.
DB289 is the first oral drug shown in clinical trials to have efficacy in treating African trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness). Mild liver toxicity was noted but was not treatment limiting. However, development of DB289 was terminated when several treated subjects developed severe kidney injury, a liability not predicted from preclinical testing. We tested the hypothesis that the kidney safety liability of DB289 would be detected in a mouse diversity panel (MDP) comprised of 34 genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. MDP mice received 10 days of oral treatment with DB289 or vehicle and classical renal biomarkers blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (sCr), as well as urine biomarkers of kidney injury were measured. While BUN and sCr remained within reference ranges, marked elevations were observed for kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) in the urine of sensitive mouse strains. KIM-1 elevations were not always coincident with elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), suggesting that renal injury was not linked to hepatic injury. Genome-wide association analyses of KIM-1 elevations indicated that genes participating in cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis and transport, oxidative stress, and cytokine release may play a role in DB289 renal injury. Taken together, the data resulting from this study highlight the utility of using an MDP to predict clinically relevant toxicities, to identify relevant toxicity biomarkers that may translate into the clinic, and to identify potential mechanisms underlying toxicities. In addition, the sensitive mouse strains identified in this study may be useful in screening next-in-class compounds for renal injury.
The nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma exert counter-regulatory effects on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and protect against liver fibrosis development in rodents. Here, we investigated whether FXR ligands regulate PPARgamma expression in HSCs and models of liver fibrosis induced in rats by porcine serum and carbon tetrachloride administration and bile duct ligation. Our results demonstrate that HSCs trans-differentiation associated with suppression of PPARgamma mRNA expression, whereas FXR mRNA was unchanged. Exposure of cells to natural and synthetic ligands of FXR, including 6-ethyl chenodeoxycholic acid (6-ECDCA), a synthetic derivative of chenodeoxycholic acid, reversed this effect and increased PPARgamma mRNA by approximately 40-fold. Submaximally effective concentrations of FXR and PPARgamma ligands were additive in inhibiting alpha1(I) collagen mRNA accumulation induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1. Administration of 6-ECDCA in rats rendered cirrhotic by porcine serum and carbon tetrachloride administration or bile duct ligation reverted down-regulation of PPARgamma mRNA expression in HSCs. Cotreatment with 6-ECDCA potentiates the antifibrotic activity of rosiglitazone, a PPARgamma ligand, in the porcine serum model as measured by morphometric analysis of liver collagen content, hydroxyproline, and liver expression of alpha1(I) collagen mRNA, alpha-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, TGFbeta1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease 1 and 2, whereas it enhanced the expression of PPARgamma and uncoupling protein 2, a PPARgamma-regulated gene, by 2-fold. In conclusion, by using an in vitro and in vivo approach, we demonstrated that FXR ligands up-regulate PPARgamma mRNA in HSCs and in rodent models of liver fibrosis. A FXR-PPARgamma cascade exerts counter-regulatory effects in HSCs activation.
We evaluated antiarrhythmic effects of N-696 using canine digitalis ventricular arrhythmia models and electrophysiological actions of N-696 using canine ventricular muscles and isolated blood perfused A-V node preparations and compared the effects with those of propranolol. 1) N-696 at 30 mg/kg, i.v. was not effective on digitalis arrhythmia, but reduced the total heart rate and atrial rate for 60 min and transiently decreased the blood pressure. Propranolol at 3 mg/kg, i.v. transiently suppressed digitalis ventricular arrhythmia and decreased the total heart rate, atrial rate and blood pressure. The minimum effective plasma concentration of propranolol was 1.7 +/- 0.4 microgram/ml. 2) Ten to 100 micrograms/ml N-696 and 3 to 10 micrograms/ml propranolol did not affect the resting potential and the action potential duration at 75% repolarization of the canine ventricular muscle, but decreased the maximum rate of rise of the action potential in a dose-dependent fashion, and 100 micrograms/ml N-696 decreased significantly the action potential amplitude. The minimum effective drug concentration of N-696 was 60 micrograms/ml, and that of propranolol was 6 micrograms/ml. 3) N-696 (30 micrograms-3mg) dose-dependently delayed the A-V conduction time of the isolated blood perfused A-V node preparation when it was administered into the posterior septal artery (PSA) and the anterior septal artery (ASA). Propranolol (10-600 micrograms) also had similar effects, but the doses of N-696 delaying the A-V conduction time by 15% was about 8 to 21 times higher than those of propranolol.
We describe a 75-year-old patient who presented with severe cholestatic liver disease. He had been receiving methyldopa, 250 mg daily, for 6 years. An extensive evaluation failed to reveal extrahepatic obstruction or serologic evidence of viral hepatitis. A liver biopsy disclosed marked cholestasis, without hepatitis, and was compatible with a rare form of methyldopa-induced liver injury. Cessation of drug treatment was followed by a slow but complete recovery. Cholestasis is a rare manifestation of methyldopa hepatotoxicity. Although methyldopa-associated liver injury usually appears after about 4 weeks of treatment, a history of a much longer exposure does not exclude this entity.
This was a prospective longitudinal multisite study of the effects of prenatal cocaine and/or opiate exposure on neurodevelopmental outcome in term and preterm infants at 1 month of age.
The sample included 658 exposed and 730 comparison infants matched on race, gender, and gestational age (11.7% born <33 weeks' gestational age). Mothers were recruited at 4 urban university-based centers and were mostly black and on public assistance. Exposure was determined by meconium assay and self-report with alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco present in both groups. At 1 month corrected age, infants were tested by masked examiners with the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale and acoustical cry analysis. Exposed and comparison groups were compared adjusting for covariates (alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, birth weight, social class, and site). Separate analyses were conducted for level of cocaine exposure.
On the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale, cocaine exposure was related to lower arousal, poorer quality of movement and self-regulation, higher excitability, more hypertonia, and more nonoptimal reflexes with most effects maintained after adjustment for covariates. Some effects were associated with heavy cocaine exposure, and effects were also found for opiates, alcohol, marijuana, and birth weight. Acoustic cry characteristics that reflect reactivity, respiratory, and neural control of the cry sound were also compromised by prenatal drug exposure, including cocaine, opiates, alcohol, and marijuana and by birth weight. Fewer cry effects remained after adjustment for covariates.
Cocaine effects are subtle and can be detected when studied in the context of polydrug use and level of cocaine exposure. Effects of other drugs even at low thresholds can also be observed in the context of a polydrug model. The ability to detect these drug effects requires a large sample and neurobehavioral tests that are differentially sensitive to drug effects. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine whether these differences develop into clinically significant deficits.
The effects of digitalis glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease, but have not been measured previously in man. We assessed the effects of ouabain (0.015 mg/kg body weight) on hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure. Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations, we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was omitted. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain, even though they were initially elevated in only two patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 11.5+/-1.4 (mean+/-SE) to 5.6+/-0.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell from 100+/-17 to 82+/-12 ml/m2 (P less than 0.01) 1 h after ouabain infusion was completed. The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1.68+/-0.11 ml/s to 2.18+/-0.21 muscle-lengths/s (P less than 0.05) and is consistent with an increase in contractility. No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients. No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients. We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end-diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal. Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial oxygen consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. Nevertheless, compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism.
Febrile seizures represent a serious adverse event following measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. We conducted a series of genome-wide association scans comparing children with MMR-related febrile seizures, children with febrile seizures unrelated to vaccination and controls with no history of febrile seizures. Two loci were distinctly associated with MMR-related febrile seizures, harboring the interferon-stimulated gene IFI44L (rs273259: P = 5.9 × 10(-12) versus controls, P = 1.2 × 10(-9) versus MMR-unrelated febrile seizures) and the measles virus receptor CD46 (rs1318653: P = 9.6 × 10(-11) versus controls, P = 1.6 × 10(-9) versus MMR-unrelated febrile seizures). Furthermore, four loci were associated with febrile seizures in general, implicating the sodium channel genes SCN1A (rs6432860: P = 2.2 × 10(-16)) and SCN2A (rs3769955: P = 3.1 × 10(-10)), a TMEM16 family gene (ANO3; rs114444506: P = 3.7 × 10(-20)) and a region associated with magnesium levels (12q21.33; rs11105468: P = 3.4 × 10(-11)). Finally, we show the functional relevance of ANO3 (TMEM16C) with electrophysiological experiments in wild-type and knockout rats.
Centrioles are essential for ciliogenesis. However, mutations in centriole biogenesis genes have been reported in primary microcephaly and Seckel syndrome, disorders without the hallmark clinical features of ciliopathies. Here we identify mutations in the genes encoding PLK4 kinase, a master regulator of centriole duplication, and its substrate TUBGCP6 in individuals with microcephalic primordial dwarfism and additional congenital anomalies, including retinopathy, thereby extending the human phenotypic spectrum associated with centriole dysfunction. Furthermore, we establish that different levels of impaired PLK4 activity result in growth and cilia phenotypes, providing a mechanism by which microcephaly disorders can occur with or without ciliopathic features.
In this study, the human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) were treated five times with 10μM benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), followed by 20 passages culture, and the in vitro BaP-induced malignant transformation of 16HBE cells was established. Five colonies in soft agarose were then amplified and donated as T-16HBE-C1∼5 cells, respectively. T-16HBE-C1∼5 cells can form tumors subcutaneously in nude mice. Histopathological changes in the tumors indicated nests growth, high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios, coarse and clumped chromatin, numerous and distinctly atypical mitoses, cell necrosis and surrounding normal adipose, muscle and connective tissue immersed. In addition, lung metastasis was observed in nude mice in T-16HBE-C1, 3 and 4 groups. In vitro cell migration assay results indicated that T-16HBE-C2∼5 cells showed much lower migration capabilities than 16HBE cells. Western blotting analysis showed that the expressions of p53 and p-Akt (Ser473) in T-16HBE-C1∼5 cells were significant higher than those in 16HBE cells. Our results demonstrated that BaP could induce the malignant transformation of 16HBE cells, and p53 and p-Akt (Ser473) might play crucial roles in BaP-induced carcinogenesis. The five monoclonal cell lines (T-16HBE-C1∼5) with different migration capabilities could be used as research models for further understanding the mechanisms of BaP-induced carcinogenesis and cell migration.
We report somatic mutations of RNF43 in over 18% of colorectal adenocarcinomas and endometrial carcinomas. RNF43 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates Wnt signaling. Truncating mutations of RNF43 are more prevalent in microsatellite-unstable tumors and show mutual exclusivity with inactivating APC mutations in colorectal adenocarcinomas. These results indicate that RNF43 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in colorectal and endometrial cancers.
This review summarizes current data on the pathomechanisms and clinical aspects of primary and secondary thrombocytosis in childhood. Primary thrombocytosis is extremely rare in childhood, mostly diagnosed at the beginning of the second decade of life. As in adults, the criteria of the Polycythemia Vera Group are appropriate to diagnose primary thrombocytosis. The pathomechansims of non-familial forms are complex and include spontaneous formation of megakaryopoietic progenitors and increased sensitivity to thrombopoietin (Tpo). Familial forms can be caused by mutations in Tpo or Tpo receptor (c-mpl) genes. These mutations result in overexpression of Tpo, sustained intracellular signalling or disturbed regulation of circulating Tpo. Treatment of primary thrombocytosis is not recommended if platelet counts are <1500/nl and bleeding or thrombosis did not occur in patient's history. In severe cases, decision on treatment should weigh potential risks of treatment options (hydroxyurea, anagrelide) against expected benefits for preventing thrombosis or haemorrhage. Secondary thrombocytosis is frequent in children, in particular in the first decade of life. Hepatic Tpo production is stimulated in acute response reaction to a variety of disorders. Thrombosis prophylaxis is not required, even at platelet counts >1000/nl, except for cases with additional prothrombotic risk factors.
The dyslipidaemia of chronic renal disease could contribute to a hypercoagulable state by activation of blood coagulation and/or impairment of fibrinolysis, thereby increasing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
We measured the coagulation activation marker prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 (F1 + 2), fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity (PAI1), interleukin-6 (IL6), insulin, lipids and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), in 12 patients with chronic renal disease before and after gemfibrozil.
Gemfibrozil significantly reduced triglycerides by 44% and increased HDL-cholesterol by 31% without significant change in LDL cholesterol. Before treatment, patients had increased F1 + 2, fibrinogen and IL6, but similar PAI1 compared with the controls, consistent with a hypercoagulable and persistent inflammatory state. Following treatment, F1 + 2 decreased to within the normal range and this reduction correlated with the decrease in triglycerides and inversely with the increase in HDL-cholesterol. A non-significant decrease in fibrinogen was inversely correlated with a significant increase in albumin. However, Lp(a) and PAI1 activity significantly increased whilst insulin and IL6 were unchanged.
Gemfibrozil improved the uraemic dyslipidaemia and hypercoagulable state by reduction in activation of blood coagulation, indirectly suggesting a reduction in lipid-dependent extrinsic pathway activity which should contribute to reduced risk of thrombosis and CVD. Reduced fibrinogen and increased albumin are consistent with a reduction in the acute phase response. Increased PAI1 and Lp(a) could impair fibrinolysis and potentially increase CVD risk, although the mechanism for these effects is uncertain but does not appear related to cytokine or insulin mediated mechanisms and requires further study. Large prospective studies are required to determine if gemfibrozil can reduce CVD events in uraemia.
Two cases of lithium neurotoxic effects are reported. Both cases are expressed by choreoathetotic movements and in both of them intoxication was caused by combined drug therapy. In our opinion caution is advised when lithium is administered in combination with drugs, especially in elderly patients.
The flavonoid 7-monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) can protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. A drawback of monoHER therapy would be the relatively high dose needed to obtain complete protection (500 mg/kg in mice). Therefore, we synthesized a series of new compounds with improved antioxidant properties. After characterization of antioxidant activity, cardioprotection in vitro, and possible toxic properties in hepatocytes, we selected Frederine for additional investigations in vivo. In the present study, it was found that this compound did not induce weight loss or (gross) organ changes in mice in a treatment schedule of 170 mg/kg i.p., 5 times/week during 2 weeks. We recorded the electrocardiogram telemetrically in mice during and 2 weeks after the combined treatment with doxorubicin (4 mg/kg, i.v.) and 5 times Frederine (68 mg/kg, i.p.; equimolar to 100 mg/kg monoHER) for 6 weeks. Complete protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was found, indicating that Frederine is at least 5 times more potent than monoHER. Frederine did not have a negative influence on the antiproliferative effects of doxorubicin on A2780, OVCAR-3, and MCF-7 cells in vitro and on OVCAR-3 xenografts grown in nude mice when administered 5 min before doxorubicin (8 mg/kg i.v.) and 4 days thereafter with an interval of 24 h. It can be concluded that we succeeded in designing a better cardioprotector than monoHER. Therefore, Frederine merits further investigation as a possible protector against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in cancer patients.
Endothelin 1 (ET-1) is increased in heart failure, both in plasma and within the central nervous system. Centrally, ET-1 induces sympathetic hyperactivity and arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion. Both sympathetic activity and AVP secretion are regulated by the arterial baroreflex, which is typically impaired in heart failure. We hypothesized that central blockade of ETA receptors (ETAR) alters the baroreflex response of heart rate, renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), and plasma AVP levels in a cardiomyopathic model of heart failure. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received weekly intraperitoneal injections of doxorubicin 2.5 mg x kg(-1) (doxorubicin heart failure, doxo-HF) or saline vehicle (control). After 8 weeks, they were instrumented, conditioned to the study environment, and then studied in the awake, non-restrained state. Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP), RSNA, and plasma osmolality were similar in both groups, but heart rate (p<0.02), left ventricular pressure (p<0.001), and plasma AVP (p<0.01) were higher in the doxo-HF group. ET-1 dose dependently increased MAP, but the rise was significantly attenuated in doxo-HF rats at all doses. Baseline baroreflex control of heart rate and RSNA was similar in both groups. ETAR blockade with 4 nmol BQ123 i.c.v. significantly decreased both the upper plateau (p<0.05) and the range (p<0.05) of the baroreflex response of both heart rate and RSNA in doxo-HF but not in control rats. Despite higher basal plasma levels of AVP, ET-1 evoked a rise in plasma AVP of 13.6+/-3.2 pg x mL(-1) in doxo-HF compared with 0.4+/-0.4 pg x mL(-1) in control rats (p<0.001). To account for the blunted pressor response to ET-1 in the doxo-HF rats, gain of AVP release was calculated as DeltaAVP/DeltaMAP and was also found to be significantly greater in the doxo-HF rats (p<0.001). BQ123 prevented the rise in AVP and restored the gain in doxo-HF rats to that seen in controls. Thus, central ETAR contribute to the sympathoexcitation and AVP responses observed in heart failure due to doxorubicin cardiomyopathy.
The effect of flecainide, 0.3 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L, on inducible nonsustained reentry was studied, in vitro, in the canine tricuspid ring. Nonsustained reentry was engineered by cutting the ring and reconnecting it with an adjustable electronic delay. Delays were used that produced reentry lasting 1-3 beats (group A), 4-10 beats (group B), and 11-25 beats (group C). Reentry was initiated multiple times at each selected delay. A proarrhythmic effect, defined as a significant increase in the duration of reentry, was observed in all 14 trials at the low dose and in two of 15 trials at the high dose in seven experiments. In four more trials a transient proarrhythmic response was seen initially during exposure to the high dose. In five of seven experiments, reentry became sustained after at least one dose of flecainide. Proarrhythmic responses resulted when flecainide increased the tachycardia cycle length more than the effective refractory period and there was less cycle length oscillation after initiation. Antiarrhythmic responses resulted either from a marked increase in effective refractory period at the site of block or production of fixed block.
Aliphatic hydrocarbons constitute a major portion of jet fuels, kerosene and other solvents. This study investigated the effects of dermal exposures of selected aliphatic hydrocarbons (nonane, dodecane and tetradecane) on the skin irritation (erythema), transepidermal waterloss (TEWL) and expression of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the skin and blood of hairless rats. Dermal exposures were carried out by occlusive application of chemicals (230 microl for 1 h, using Hill Top Chambers) for 1 h. The expression of IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha and MCP-1 was measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and the regulatory proteins NFkappaB and IkappaBalpha were measured by Western blot analysis. The skin irritation and TEWL data indicate that the irritation was in the following decreasing order: nonane > dodecane > tetradecane. Likewise, nonane significantly increased the expression of IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha and MCP-1 in skin and blood as compared to control at different time points. Dodecane and tetradecane did not show any increase in the expression of IL-1alpha and MCP-1 as compared to control (P > 0.05), but the expression of TNF-alpha by dodecane and tetradecane was significantly higher than control at all time points. The release of cytokines by nonane exposure was further supported by activation of NFkappaB p65 and corresponding degradation of IkappaBalpha in the skin. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the biophysical parameters (TEWL and erythema scores) were correlated to the biomarker expressions after dermal exposures with nonane but not with dodecane and tetradecane. Dodecane produced only mild irritation in response to experimental conditions of the present study and further did not show significant differences in IL-1alpha and MCP-1 levels in skin and blood. However, TNF-alpha was well expressed in response to all the chemicals. Tetradecane did not show any visible signs of skin irritation and also did not produce any significant difference in IL-1alpha and MCP-1 release profiles as compared with control. The expression of TNF-alpha in skin due to tetradecane support the fact that visually indistinguishable skin irritation reactions can induce significant changes in the biological marker profile.
Increased cardiac sensitivity to epinephrine during halothane anesthesia has been well documented; however, there are few reports of increased cardiac irritability due to interaction between halothane anesthesia and aminophylline. The following case report is suggestive of such an interaction resulting in ventricular tachycardia.
Experimental central nervous system (CNS) tumours have been proposed as a useful model for the study of oncogenesis, epiphenomena related to cancer and for the design of new therapeutic strategies.
The administration of chemical substances is one of the most commonly-used methods to induce CNS neoplasms. N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) belongs to the nitrosourea family, a wide group of alkylating agents that are able to induce brain tumours in litters after transplacentary administration at the 15th day of pregnancy. This nitrogenous urea compound has a high mutation inducibility affecting the expression of oncogenes such as p53, neu/erbB-2 and Ras. Prenatal exposition of Sprague Dawley rats to ENU induces intra-axial tumours of glial lineage and extra-axial malignant schwannomas. Although the precise mechanism of tumour induction is unclear, it is known to affect cell differentiation of primitive neuroepithelium from the subventricular plate generating oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, mixed gliomas or ependimomas.
The transplacentary administration of ENU induces the development of gliomas and schwannomas that are similar to those found in humans. Animal models are necessary and useful for further studies to get an early diagnosis and to establish correct therapeutic indications.
Levodopa-induced dyskinesias are one of the major limiting side effects encountered in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Dopamine agonists of the D2 family are less prone to induce these abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), and in some instances it has been proposed that they could counteract them once already established. As differences in the plasma half-life of a given DA agonist could be related with a greater or lesser propensity to induce or to counteract AIMs, we compared the effects of two D2 agonists (cabergoline and pramipexole) with different half-lives, and levodopa, at doses producing similar improvement in purposeful forelimb use, in rats with severe nigrostriatal lesion, previously sensitized to levodopa. The same therapeutic regime was subsequently used in pharmacologically naïve rats. We found that: (i) prior induction of AIMs by levodopa administration primes rats for the occurrence of AIMs during mono-therapy with pramipexole (but not with cabergoline); (ii) an intervening period of D2 agonist mono-therapy does not modify the severity of AIMs induced by subsequent mono-therapy with levodopa; iii. de novo treatment with D2 agonists is associated with a lower risk of AIMs (regardless of the severity of the lesion) and does not modify AIMs during subsequent mono-therapy with levodopa. An unexpected finding was that prior levodopa therapy sensitized rats to the therapeutic effects of D2 agonists given in mono-therapy. In summary, the use of the rat with nigrostriatal lesion to model relevant therapeutic conditions does not support that D2 agonists prevent the development of AIMs during subsequent levodopa mono-therapy or can revert the dysfunction underlying it.
Chlorambucil is an alkylating agent commonly used in veterinary oncology for conditions including lymphoma. Chlorambucil neurotoxicity has been well recognized in human patients. Onsets of central nervous system signs, such as myoclonus, tremors, muscular twitching, agitation, and tonic-clonic seizures, have been reported in humans and laboratory animals treated with chlorambucil. This case of a cat with intestinal lymphoma represents the first veterinary patient reported to have chlorambucil-induced neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity should be considered a potential side effect of chlorambucil therapy in veterinary patients.
Thiamine hydrochloride was studied on lead-induced endogenous lipid peroxidation in rat hepatic and renal tissues following po doses of 2.73 mg lead/kg bw for 6 w. Simultaneous use of 25 mg thiamine hydrochloride/kg bw po reduced lead accumulation in liver and kidneys. There were significant decreases in endogenous lipid peroxide in liver and kidney from thiamine hydrochloride-treated rats. Histopathological lesions in thiamine-treated livers and kidneys were milder in comparison to lesions in untreated Pb-exposed animals. This indicates the prophylactic potential of thiamine for lead-induced lipid peroxidation.
