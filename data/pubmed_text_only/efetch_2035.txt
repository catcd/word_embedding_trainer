The incidence of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-related cardiotoxicity seems to be dosage and schedule dependent. It was reported as 1.6-3% with earlier bolus regimens whereas this increased up to 7.6-18% with prolonged (4-5 days) infusion regimens. Knowledge of the cardiotoxicity incidence in patients treated with the widely used de Gramont's regimen (2 days infusional 5-FU) and the long-term follow-up of affected patients is still limited.
We investigated the incidence and clinical characteristics of the cardiotoxicity of de Gramont's regimen and long-term follow-up of the affected patients.
Nine of a total of 231 patients receiving de Gramont's regimen experienced cardiac events, revealing an overall incidence of 3.9%. Four (2.5%) cases were receiving de Gramont's regimen only. Cardiac manifestations were acute coronary syndrome (n = 6), congestive heart failure (n = 2) and atrial fibrillation (n = 1). Cardiotoxicity occurred in the first cycle in eight patients, and in the second cycle in one. The median onset day was day 2. Cardiac symptoms occurred mostly at night time (seven patients) and the onset was a few hours after the bolus part of the regimen in four out of seven patients. After the cardiotoxicity, treatments were continued safely without 5-FU.
de Gramont's regimen has a lower incidence of cardiotoxicity compared with more prolonged 5-FU-based infusion regimens. Nevertheless, patients should still be carefully monitored especially in the first cycles and at night time.
It is well known that aspirin consumption temporarily reduces overall otoacoustic emission (OAE) amplitude in humans. However, little is known about changes in the separate components of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), which may be distinguished by examining phase gradients. The effects of aspirin on the phase gradient of the DPOAE 2F1-F2 obtained with fixed frequency ratio sweeps were studied longitudinally in a group of twelve subjects in whom a temporary hearing loss was induced by aspirin consumption. DPOAE were recorded daily for two days pre-aspirin consumption, during the three days of aspirin consumption and two days afterwards. DP-grams were recorded over a restricted frequency range centered on 2,3,4 and 6 kHz with the following stimulus levels: L1/L2 of 60/50-80/70 in 10-dB steps. The effects of aspirin on the phase gradients varied between the subjects and across frequency: the general trend was that the phase gradient became steeper across successive sessions for the higher frequencies, while no significant effect was found at the lower frequencies. These results suggest that aspirin may have more persistent effects on cochlear function than are disclosed by measurements of hearing threshold level or DPOAE amplitude. Particularly, DPOAE phase gradient appears to be increased by aspirin consumption and has not recovered two days after cessation of aspirin intake, despite almost complete recovery of DPOAE amplitude and hearing threshold levels. These findings may suggest differential effects on the distortion and reflection mechanisms considered to underlie DPOAE generation.
In order to explore the feasibility of gene therapy strategy based on the human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) gene delivery for the treatment of nephropathy and compare the diuretic activities of the hANP gene injected intramuscularly(i.m.) and intravenously(i.v.), the naked retroviral vector DNA harboring the hANP cDNA under the control of retroviral 5' long terminal repeat at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight was injected i.m. or i.v. into the nephrotic model rats induced with adriamycin(ADR) injected i.v. at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg body weight. A single injection of the hANP gene resulted in a marked elevation in plasma level of hANP 5 days after gene delivery and a significant increase in the ratio of urine volume to body weight and the diuretic effect continued for more than 15 days. In addition, there was a significant rise in the body weight of treatment groups as compared with that of negative control group and no difference in the concentrations of electrolytes in urine between groups. There was no significant differences in total effects resulted from the two routes of gene delivery and the way of gene delivery through the skeletal muscle is simpler and easier. These results suggest that somatic gene delivery of the hANP gene could enhance the renal functions in nephrotic rats significantly and would be a potential strategy for the treatment of renal disorders.
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the prototypic ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), promotes tumor formation in some model systems. However, with regard to breast cancer, epidemiological and animal studies are inconclusive as to whether exposure increases tumor incidence or may instead be protective. We have previously reported that mice exposed to TCDD during pregnancy have impaired differentiation of mammary tissue, including decreased branching and poor development of lobuloalveolar structures. Because normal pregnancy-induced mammary differentiation may protect against subsequent neoplastic transformation, we hypothesized that TCDD-treated mice would be more susceptible to chemical carcinogenesis after parturition. To test this, mice were treated with TCDD or vehicle during pregnancy. Four weeks later, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) was administered to induce mammary tumor formation. Contrary to our hypothesis, TCDD-exposed parous mice showed a 4-week delay in tumor formation relative to controls, and they had a lower tumor incidence throughout the 27-week time course. The same results were obtained in nulliparous mice given TCDD and DMBA on the same schedule. We next addressed whether the delayed tumor incidence was a reflection of decreased tumor initiation, by testing the formation of DMBA-DNA adducts and preneoplastic lesions, induction of cytochrome P450s, and cell proliferation. None of these markers of tumor initiation differed between vehicle- and TCDD-treated animals. The expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 was also measured to address their possible role in tumorigenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that AhR activation by TCDD slows the promotion of preneoplastic lesions to overt mammary tumors.
Renal papillary necrosis develops 16 hr after intravenous administration of aspirin to the uninephrectomised homozygous Gunn rat. Ultrastructural studies show the papillary interstitial cells to be most severely affected, the first changes being visible at 1 hr. Changes in capillaries are late in onset, and this suggests that the lesions are due to a direct toxic effect rather than to ischaemia.
Based on observations that mutations of GATA-3 are responsible for the HDR-syndrome (hypoparathyroidism, deafness, renal defects) and that GATA-transcription factors have an important role to play in inner ear development, we hypothesized that these transcription factors may be involved in regulatory changes of prestin transcription. To prove this, we examined in parallel the expression of mRNA of prestin and Gata-3,-2 and Gata-1 in the organ of Corti during early postnatal development of rats and in organotypic cultures. Remarkable relations are observed between prestin and Gata-3,-2 expression in organ of Corti preparations in vivo and in vitro: (i) Gata-3,-2 expression display similar apical-basal gradients as prestin mRNA levels. (ii) The prestin expression increases between postnatal day two and postnatal day eight by a factor of about four in the apical and middle segments and by a factor of two in the basal part. Highly significant Pearson correlation coefficients were observed between Gata-3,-2 mRNA and prestin levels when the data were evaluated by regression analyses. (iii) Parallel changes of prestin mRNA and Gata-3,-2 mRNA levels were observed in response to thyroid hormone and to gemfibrozil application. These observations suggest a regulatory role played by the Gata-3,-2 transcription factors in prestin expression.
We compared the efficacy of magnesium sulphate, lignocaine, sodium bicarbonate or alfentanil in minimizing pain due to injection of rocuronium in 250 patients. After tourniquet application on the forearm, the patients were given saline, magnesium sulphate, lignocaine, sodium bicarbonate 8.4% or alfentanil, diluted into a 3 ml solution. The occlusion was released after 20 seconds, and rocuronium was injected over 10 to 15 seconds. The patients were observed and asked immediately if they had pain in the arm and the response was assessed. Reactions such as discomfort and pain, withdrawal of the hand and screaming after the administering of the rocuronium were recorded as side-effects and patients were reassessed at 24 hours postoperatively. We concluded that magnesium sulphate, lignocaine, sodium bicarbonate or alfentanil decreased the level of rocuronium injection pain. Of these drugs, magnesium sulphate, lignocaine and sodium bicarbonate were the most effective while alfentanil was the least effective.
The authors report a case of amiodaron-induced neuropathy in a seventy one years old man. First signs appeared seventeen months after the treatment was started with 400 mg/day for one year and continued with 200 mg/day. Examination on the 29th month disclosed a severe sensory and motor deficit of the limbs with distal predominancy. Motor nerve conduction velocity was strongly impaired without modification of distal latencies. Fundi were normal. The patient improved quickly after drug withdrawal. The authors review the rare similar cases reported in the literature and attempt to describe the clinical caracteristics of amiodaron neuropathy. Qualitative and quantitative light and electron microscopical studies of nerve, muscle and skin biopsies, including teased fibers preparations were performed and they disclosed a marked reduction of the number of myelinated fibers. Wallerian degeneration predominated (31 p. 100) other segmental demyalination (25 p. 100). Numerous polymorphous lipid-laden lysosomes were present in Schwann cells, fibrocytes, pericytes, endothelial and muscle cells. These previously undescribed morphological findings are similar to those present in perhexiline maleate intoxications. We believe amiodaron neuropathy is a new neuropathy with drug-induced lipidosis.
The uninephrectomised homozygous Gunn rat is more sensitive than other experimental animals to the nephrotoxic effects of analgesics. Phenacetin derivatives produce severe necrosis of proximal convoluted tubules and aspirin and phenazone renal papillary necrosis. The observations suggest that the components of compound analgesic preparations have separate and complementary nephrotoxic effects, and this is a possible factor contributing to the association of analgesic nephropathy with abuse of such preparations.
Dopaminergic anti-parkinsonian medications, such as levodopa (LD) cause drug-induced dyskinesias (DID) in majority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Mucuna pruriens, a legume extensively used in Ayurveda to treat PD, is reputed to provide anti-parkinsonian benefits without inducing DID. We compared the behavioral effects of chronic parenteral administration of a water extract of M. pruriens seed powder (MPE) alone without any additives, MPE combined with the peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) benserazide (MPE+BZ), LD+BZ and LD alone without BZ in the hemiparkinsonian rat model of PD. A battery of behavioral tests assessed by blinded investigators served as outcome measures in these randomized trials. In experiment 1, animals that received LD+BZ or MPE+BZ at high (6mg/kg) and medium (4mg/kg) equivalent doses demonstrated significant alleviation of parkinsonism, but, developed severe dose-dependent DID. LD+BZ at low doses (2mg/kg) did not provide significant alleviation of parkinsonism. In contrast, MPE+BZ at an equivalent low dose significantly ameliorated parkinsonism. In experiment 2, MPE without any additives (12mg/kg and 20mg/kg LD equivalent dose) alleviated parkinsonism with significantly less DID compared to LD+BZ or MPE+BZ. In experiment 3, MPE without additives administered chronically provided long-term anti-parkinsonian benefits without causing DID. In experiment 4, MPE alone provided significantly more behavioral benefit when compared to the equivalent dose of synthetic LD alone without BZ. In experiment 5, MPE alone reduced the severity of DID in animals initially primed with LD+BZ. These findings suggest that M. pruriens contains water-soluble ingredients that either have an intrinsic DDCI-like activity or mitigate the need for an add-on DDCI to ameliorate parkinsonism. These unique long-term anti-parkinsonian effects of a parenterally administered water extract of M. pruriens seed powder may provide a platform for future drug discoveries and novel treatment strategies in PD.
Amikacin was administered to 18 patients with gram-negative septicemia. Ten of the patients had blood culture isolates highly resistant to gentamicin; six of these patients had persistent bacteremia while receiving gentamicin alone or in combination with other agents. Fourteen of the 18 patients were cured with amikacin therapy and adjunctive measures. Nine of the 10 patients with gentamicin-resistant pathogens were cured. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity in four patients with elevated amikacin serum levels and serious underlying disease indicates the desirability of monitoring serum amikacin levels. Minor ototoxicity occurred in two patients and was associated with prolonged therapy and high serum amikacin levels. Amikacin is a highly effective agent for treating patients with gram-negative bacteremia; it is the agent of choice in the therapy of patients with suspected or documented gram-negative bacteremia caused by pathogens resistant to gentamicin and susceptible to amikacin.
Treatment with amikacin was evaluated in 15 patients with gram-negative bacteremia. The sources of sepsis were urinary tract (in six patients), abdomen (in five) and miscellaneous sites (in four). Sixteen bacterial pathogens were recovered, including three gentamicin-resistant organisms. All isolates were susceptible to amikacin. Eleven of the 14 patients who could be evaluated fulfilled the criteria for cure, including the three patients with gentamicin-resistant organisms. Three patients failed to respond to amikacin therapy. Monitoring untoward effects revealed eighth nerve toxicity in one patient and nephrotoxicity in one patient. These results indicate that amikacin is effective in the treatment of patients with gram-negative bacteremia, even when caused by gentamicin-resistant bacteria.
In 3 patients with severe cardiac failure high dose therapy with the ACE inhibitor enalapril was instituted during a state of extracellular volume depletion. Severe arterial hypotension with reversible renal insufficiency developed in all the patients. In two the hypovolemia was induced by diuretic treatment and in one by an acute infection with diarrhea. The latter patient also developed life-threatening hyperkalemia with cardiac arrest since he was also receiving spironolactone and potassium supplements. These cases demonstrate that ACE inhibitors should not be instituted during extracellular volume depletion and their initial dosage should be low. The dangerous combination of ACE inhibitors with spironolactone and potassium supplements should be avoided wherever possible.
Southeast Asians known as the Hmong have a high prevalence of tuberculosis and select cancers. The slow acetylation (SA) phenotype for N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) has been associated with toxicity from the anti-tuberculosis drug, isoniazid and in increased risk of select cancers. Previous research indicates a 74.5% prevalence of SA in Hmong which differs from other Asian populations including the Japanese and Thai (range: 7%-45%). Given this contrast, the purpose of this study was to confirm or refute this unexpected predominance of the SA phenotype in Hmong. Unrelated, Minnesota Hmong between 18 and 65 years of age consented and participated by ingesting caffeine as the probe for NAT2. A urinary caffeine metabolic ratio AFMU/1X (<0.6) was used to classify subjects as slow acetylators. Among 51 analysable samples provided by 61 enrollees (27 male, 33 female, 1 sex unknown, age 30+/-11 years [mean+/-SD]) there were 47 (92.2%) slow and 4 (7.8%) rapid acetylators. The prevalence of the SA phenotype (92.2%) from this study exceeds the 74.5% (p<0.02 by chi-square test) previously noted in Minnesota Hmong (n=98). The predominance of the SA phenotype within Minnesota Hmong is confirmed. Further studies evaluating this unexpected prevalence, its genetic basis and potential clinical relevance to drug toxicity and disease are warranted.
The association of daily oral cyclophosphamide with the development of transitional cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder had been documented. We report the first 2 cases of transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and an additional 4 cases of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder following cyclophosphamide ingestion. Patients who have been taking daily oral cyclophosphamide for a prolonged period should have excretory urography, cystoscopy and bladder mucosal biopsies performed as part of a cancer surveillance protocol.
A syndrome of retroperitoneal hemorrhage during anticoagulant therapy associated with nerve involvement in femoral nerve or lumbar plexus is described. Twenty-one cases were collected from the English-language literature, and five new cases were added for review and analysis. In these 26 cases spontaneous hemorrhage occurred under iliopsoas fascia in the retroperitoneal space. The clinical picture, involved nerves, laboratory findings of coagulation studies, anemia, and the outcome of these cases are summarized and discussed. Retroperitoneal space may contain a large quantity of internal hemorrhage. Irreversible damage of lumbar plexus or femoral nerve may result from entrapment of nerves in the hematoma. Laboratory coagulation studies may guide effective administration of anticoagulant therapy and minimize hemorrhagic complication, but they will not eliminate the risk of hemorrhage completely.
Sudden, unexpected death due to cocaine in young otherwise healthy individuals occurs in an idiosyncratic manner and is commonly felt to be arrhythmogenic in nature, although the exact cause of death is rarely documented. In addition to indirect sympathomimetic actions, cocaine is a potent sodium channel blocking drug and, in this regard, most closely resembles agents such as flecainide. We suggest that sudden death due to cocaine is proarrhythmic in nature, occurring under similar circumstances as that due to specific antiarrhythmic drugs.
L-DOPA treatment induces abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) in Parkinson's patients and experimental animals. We examined the relationship between the development of AIMs (dyskinesia) and changes in [(3)H]-GABA release and cAMP signaling in striatonigral terminals of rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions. Analysis of AIMs scores in hemiparkinsonian rats treated with L-DOPA for 20 days was fitted by the sum of two Gaussian distributions showing the presence of two populations: one with mild and the other with severe dyskinesia. cAMP signaling was evaluated in the two populations by determining changes in cAMP formation, Gα(olf) and adenylyl cyclase type V/VI levels. In animals that were not treated with L-DOPA, all the parameters were significantly increased in the denervated side. In the animals that had mild dyskinesia, L-DOPA treatment normalized these parameters. In contrast, in the animals in which l-DOPA treatment induced severe dyskinesia all the parameters, except for Gα(olf) levels, were significantly higher in the denervated side. Similarly, D1-stimulated [(3)H]-GABA release was not elevated in L-DOPA-treated animals with mild dyskinesia but was increased in animals with severe dyskinesia. Changes in Gα(olf) and adenylyl cyclase type V/VI levels in the striatum paralleled the response in the SNr. The linkage between the changes in [(3)H]-GABA release and cAMP activity was further evaluated with the selective adenylyl cyclase V/VI antagonist NKY80. This inhibitor blocked the increases of both [(3)H]-GABA release and cAMP production. These results indicate that increased expression of adenylyl cyclase V/VI is a major determinant of increased GABAergic transmission in the substantia nigra pars reticulata of animals in which L-DOPA induces severe dyskinesia.
Autistic patients have a 100 to 190-fold increased risk of neurofibromatosis compared to the general population. This suggests that the two diseases may share a common etiological background. Recently, a new allele (or the six-repeat allele) of the (AAAT)(n) repeat polymorphism in an Alu sequence in the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) gene was observed exclusively in severe autistic patients, not in controls, in Caucasians of French ancestry. This suggests a role of the NF1 gene in the development of autism. We investigated three microsatellite polymorphisms within the intron-27b and intron-38 of the NF1 region, including the (AAAT)(n) and two (CA)n repeat polymorphisms, in Japanese subjects with autism (n = 74) and controls (n = 122). The six-repeat allele of the (AAAT)(n) polymorphism was not found either in patients or controls, possibly indicating an ethnic difference in the polymorphism. However, significant differences were observed in the allele distributions of the (AAAT)(n) and a (CA)(n), which were located at intron-27b, between patients and controls, although an association was not significant between autism and another polymorphism at intron-38. This may suggest an involvement of the NF1 locus in susceptibility to autism, although further investigations are recommended.
The authors studied the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of a new sustained-release formulation of nifedipine 50 mg once a day, in comparison with nifedipine retard 20 mg twice a day in patients with mild or moderate primary arterial hypertension. Both treatments significantly lowered blood pressure with no difference in daily blood pressure profile. At steady state, the two drugs determined comparable plasma levels of nifedipine as measured immediately before the morning dose. After a 12-month treatment, the new formulation of nifedipine still displayed satisfactory blood pressure control in both supine and standing positions, with no change in tolerability throughout the study. In conclusion, this new sustained-release formulation of nifedipine has similar efficacy and tolerability to conventional treatment with nifedipine retard 20 mg twice a day.
L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias constitute a challenge to the management of advanced Parkinson's disease. According to recent reports, treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist amantadine may significantly diminish L-dopa-induced dyskinesias. In the present study, the effect of amantadine on L-dopa-induced dykinesias was assessed in a 5-week, double-blind crossover trial. Dyskinesia severity as assessed following oral L-dopa challenges and by self-scoring dyskinesia diaries were reduced approximately 50% after amantadine treatment compared with baseline or placebo phases. Similarly, dyskinesia assessments on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part IV (items 32 and 33) also revealed significant improvement after treatment with amantadine. The magnitude of the L-dopa motor response to oral challenges was not different after amantadine or placebo treatment, and there was no significant reduction of daily off-time when patients received active treatment. These results confirm previous observations concerning the antidyskinetic potential of amantadine.
In-vivo 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies were undertaken with anesthetized rats to determine: a. whether systemic administration of MgCl2 could protect animals against cocaine-induced hemorrhagic stroke, and b. whether a relationship exists between basal levels of brain intracellular free magnesium ions ([Mg2+]i), phosphometabolites, and stroke risk. Repeat 31P-NMR spectra were obtained at various intervals of time (3-120 min, or up until death) after administration of cocaine (5 + 30 mg/kg). Ion selective electrodes were used to measure plasma Mg2+, K+, Na+ and Ca2+. Forty percent of animals died in the absence of Mg2+ infusion following high dosage of cocaine. Only 13% died with cocaine following Mg2+ infusion (p <0.005). In the Mg2+-protected animals, neither brain [Mg2+]i,intracellular pH (pHi), [phosphocreatine-PCr]/[ATP], nor brain [inorganic phosphate-Pi]/[ATP] fell when toxic and lethal doses of cocaine were given. Low basal brain [Mg2+]i (275 +/- 24 vs. 466 +/- 35 microM, p <0.01) and low basal brain [PCr] (3.36 +/- 0.35 vs. 4.26 +/- 0.24 mM, p <0.01) were found to be associated with a 3-fold increased incidence of stroke. A positive correlation (r = 0.31, p <0.03) between brain [Mg2+]1 and [PCr]/[ATP] was found. It is possible that both brain [Mg2+]i and [PCr] may be useful as important predictors of susceptibility to cocaine-induced hemorrhagic stroke.
There has been concern regarding risks from inhalation exposure to nanoparticles (NPs). The large number of particles requiring testing means that alternative approaches to animal testing are needed.
We set out to determine whether short-term in vitro assays that assess intrinsic oxidative stress potential and membrane-damaging potency of a panel of metal oxide NPs can be used to predict their inflammogenic potency.
For a panel of metal oxide NPs, we investigated intrinsic free radical generation, oxidative activity in an extracellular environment, cytotoxicity to lung epithelial cells, hemolysis, and inflammation potency in rat lungs. All exposures were carried out at equal surface area doses.
Only nickel oxide (NiO) and alumina 2 caused significant lung inflammation when instilled into rat lungs at equal surface area, suggesting that these two had extra surface reactivity. We observed significant free radical generation with 4 of 13 metal oxides, only one of which was inflammogenic. Only 3 of 13 were significantly hemolytic, two of which were inflammogenic.
Potency in generating free radicals in vitro did not predict inflammation, whereas alumina 2 had no free radical activity but was inflammogenic. The hemolysis assay was correct in predicting the proinflammatory potential of 12 of 13 of the particles examined. Using a battery of simple in vitro tests, it is possible to predict the inflammogenicity of metal oxide NPs, although some false-positive results are likely. More research using a larger panel is needed to confirm the efficacy and generality of this approach for metal oxide NPs.
We describe 12 patients with Parkinson's disease and pathologic gambling. This association has apparently never been reported. The patients were selected from a Parkinson's disease unit of 250 patients. They met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, criteria for pathologic gambling. All patients underwent a neurologic, psychiatric, and psychologic examination, specifically noting the presence or absence of psychopathology in the spectrum of impulse control disorder and the nature of the gambling. Ten patients started gambling after the onset of Parkinson's disease and treatment with levodopa. The pathologic behavior was exclusively present or was markedly increased in "on" periods in 11 patients. All patients had motor fluctuations at the time of the study. Slot machines were the preferred source of gambling for 10 patients, similar to the Spanish gambling population. That the gambling behavior appears more often in the "on" periods of motor fluctuations and that it begins after the onset of Parkinson's disease in most patients and worsens with levodopa therapy suggest that it could be related to the dopaminergic tone in patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations (that is, it could represent a behavioral manifestation of pharmacologic treatment).
The objective of this study was to examine the association between psychiatric symptoms and methamphetamine dependence. A four-hour survey was administered to 1,580 arrestees sampled from the 14 most populous counties in California. The survey included items assessing demographic profile, history of substance dependence, and psychiatric symptomatology. In the 12 months prior to the assessment, methamphetamine-dependent individuals were more likely to report depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation than individuals denying methamphetamine dependence, even after controlling for demographic profile and dependence on other drugs. Methamphetamine-dependent individuals also were more likely to report a need for psychiatric assistance at the time of the interview. These findings suggest that methamphetamine-dependent individuals are at greater risk to experience particular psychiatric symptoms. Further study to determine the etiology of these symptoms is warranted.
