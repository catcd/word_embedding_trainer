This study was designed to investigate the potentially protective effects of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and the role of transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2(NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling in the regulation of Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced chronic liver fibrosis in mice. The potentially protective effects of GA on CCl(4)-induced chronic liver fibrosis in mice were depicted histologically and biochemically. Firstly, histopathological changes including regenerative nodules, inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis were induced by CCl(4).Then, CCl(4) administration caused a marked increase in the levels of serum aminotransferases (GOT, GPT), serum monoamine oxidase (MAO) and lipid peroxidation (MDA) as well as MAO in the mice liver homogenates. Also, decreased nuclear Nrf2 expression, mRNA levels of its target genes such as superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2), and activity of cellular antioxidant enzymes were found after CCl(4) exposure. All of these phenotypes were markedly reversed by the treatment of the mice with GA. In addition, GA exhibited the antioxidant effects in vitro by on FeCl(2)-ascorbate induced lipid peroxidation in mouse liver homogenates, and on DPPH scavenging activity. Taken together, these results suggested that GA can protect the liver from oxidative stress in mice, presumably through activating the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, enhancing the expression of its target genes and increasing the activity of the antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, GA may be an effective hepatoprotective agent and viable candidate for treating liver fibrosis and other oxidative stress-related diseases.
Several important chemicals, including formaldehyde, 1,4-dichloro-2-butene, bis-chloromethyl ether, hexamethylphosphoramide, and epichlorohydrin have been shown to produce nasal tumours in rats following repeated or continuous inhalation exposures. Some of these compounds are respiratory irritants. To determine whether there is a correlation between the ability of a chemical to produce sensory irritation and to elicit nasal tumours, the atmospheric concentration causing a 50% decrease in the respiratory rate (RD50) of male rats was determined. Three other nasal tumorigens, dimethylcarbamoyl chloride, 2,3,4-trichloro-1-butene and 1,2-ethoxy-3-phenoxypropane, were also studied. No correlation between sensory irritation potency and nasal tumorigenic potential was observed. The most potent nasal tumorigen hexamethylphosphoramide, which produces tumours in rats following 12 months' continuous exposure to 50 ppb, failed to cause any decrease in respiratory rate when tested at 351 ppm (an aerosol exposure level which exceeds atmospheric saturation by approximately ten times).
The relationship between the cyclophosphamide metabolite acrolein and hemorrhagic cystitis is well documented. Its role in inducing bladder cancer is not clear. There are at least 35 cases of cyclophosphamide-associated bladder cancer in the literature to date. We report 3 additional cases of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Literature assessing the relative risk of bladder cancer associated with cyclophosphamide therapy is reviewed as are methods for decreasing the toxic effects on the urothelium of the metabolite acrolein.
The antianginal effect of KRN2391, N-cyano-N'-(2-nitroxyethyl)-3-pyridinecarboximidamide monomethanesulfonate, on various anginal models in rats was compared with those of nifedipine and nicorandil. Angina pectoris was induced by methacholine or isoproterenol, and the change in the ST-segments in the electrocardiogram (ECG) was used as the parameter to indicate angina pectoris. The intracoronary administration of methacholine (3 micrograms) produced an elevation in the ST-segment of the ECG. This ST-elevation was inhibited by the intravenous administration of KRN2391 (30 and 100 micrograms/kg), nifedipine (100 and 300 micrograms/kg) and nicorandil (1000 and 3000 micrograms/kg). The administration of isoproterenol (10 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) produced a depression of the ST-segment of the ECG. The intravenous administration of KRN2391 (100 micrograms/kg), nifedipine (100 micrograms/kg) and nicorandil (3000 micrograms/kg) inhibited the ECG changes induced by isoproterenol. These results suggest that KRN2391 exerts a potent protective effect on angina pectoris models compared with nifedipine and nicorandil. KRN2391 appears to be useful as an antianginal drug.
C3H/HeN-MTV+ female mice were fed diets containing targeted concentrations of 320 or 640 ppb diethylstilboestrol (DES) starting at 3, 5, 7 or 11 wk of age and continuing throughout their remaining lifespan. Mice were housed in either a single-corridor conventional animal room or in a double-corridor barrier-type animal room. Mice housed in the conventional animal room and started on DES at 7 or 11 week of age developed palpable mammary tumours somewhat sooner than the corresponding groups of mice kept in the barrier animal room. In mice housed in the barrier animal room and exposed to a given DES concentration, there was very little difference between mice started on DES at 3, 5 or 7 wk of age in the exposure time required for the development of palpable mammary tumours. There was a striking difference, however, between mice started on DES at 7 wk and those started at 11 wk of age in the exposure time needed before mammary tumours appeared. Mice started at 11 wk of age developed tumours with, on average, about 4 wk less exposure than did those started at 7 wk. This suggests that treatment between 7 and 11 wk of age had little or no effect on mammary tumour development. In conclusion, both animal-room environment and age at the start of DES treatment influenced the mammary tumour response in female C3H/HeN-MTV+ mice.
Radiofrequency ablation of the "slow pathway" in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) relies on tachycardia non-inducibility after ablation as success criterion. However, AVNRT is frequently non-inducible at baseline. Thus, autonomic enhancement using either atropine or isoproterenol is frequently used for arrhythmia induction before ablation.
80 patients (57 women, 23 men, age 50+/-14 years) undergoing slow pathway ablation for recurrent AVNRT were randomized to receive either 0.01 mg/kg atropine or 0.5-1.0 microg/kg/min isoproterenol before ablation after baseline assessment of AV conduction. The effects of either drug on ante- and retrograde conduction was assessed by measuring sinus cycle length, PR and AH interval, antegrade and retrograde Wenckebach cycle length (WBCL), antegrade effective refractory period (ERP) of slow and fast pathway and maximal stimulus-to-H interval during slow and fast pathway conduction.
Inducibility of AVNRT at baseline was not different between patients randomized to atropine (73%) and isoproterenol (58%) but was reduced after atropine (45%) compared to isoproterenol (93%, P<0.001). Of the 28 patients non-inducible at baseline isoproterenol rendered AVNRT inducible in 21, atropine in 4 patients. Dual AV nodal pathway physiology was present in 88% before and 50% after atropine compared to 83% before and 73% after isoproterenol. Whereas both drugs exerted similar effects on ante- and retrograde fast pathway conduction maximal SH interval during slow pathway conduction was significantly shorter after isoproterenol (300+/-48 ms vs. 374+/-113 ms, P=0.012).
Isoproterenol yields higher AVNRT inducibility than atropine in patients non-inducible at baseline. This may be caused by a more pronounced effect on antegrade slow pathway conduction.
Female Sprague-Dawley rats were given daily oral doses of 2 combined oral contraceptive (OC) steroids, 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and 19-norethisterone (NE), for a maximum of 8 weeks. A low-dose group of rats received 0.25 mg/kg EE2 and 2.50 mg/kg NE. A high-dose group was given weekly doubled doses until levels of 4 mg/kg EE2 and 40 mg/kg NE were reached. The rats were fed a low-protein (LP) (8%) diet starting 8 weeks before treatment with the OC and continuing throughout the study. Cholestatic liver injury, as measured by basal bile flow, bile acid secretion, and organic anion (bromosulfophthalein) excretion, could be induced in control rats receiving the LP diet alone. In control animals on a normal diet, steroid administration alone produced a marked dose-dependent cholestatic effect. However, the combination of a chronic LP diet with OC resulted in an ameliorating effect on the pathophysiology of bile secretion and hepatic excretory function. The histopathological adaptive changes induced by OC were absent when the LP diet was administered simultaneously. Thus, in the rat, mild protein malnutrition does not enhance the cholestatic effect of the steroids but rather protects the liver from cholestatic liver damage caused by an LP diet or OC administration alone.
AT(1)-blockade has been shown to induce weight loss in animals or patients. The aim of this study was to investigate whether weight reduction after AT(1)-blockade is dependent on dose, blood pressure reduction and leptin signalling. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and lean and obese Zucker rats were treated for 4 weeks with candesartan (0, 2, 6 or 16 mg/kg/day). Body weight, food intake and hypothalamic mRNA levels of (an)orexigenic peptides were determined. Obese Zucker rats served as a model of primary leptin resistance. In SHR, body mass index and food intake were decreased selectively by 16 mg/kg/day candesartan but not after using normal (2 mg/kg/day) or supranormal (6 mg/kg/day) doses. Correlation analysis between blood pressure and body weight indicated no relationship of hypotensive potency on weight loss. The hypothalamic mRNA levels of the orexigenic peptide MCH (melanin-concentrating hormone) were diminished in parallel. Consistent to the results in SHRs, 16 mg/kg/day candesartan revealed a decrease of body weight, food intake and hypothalamic MCH mRNA levels in lean Zucker rats. In obese Zucker rats, none of these parameters were reduced by candesartan. Loss of body weight and hypophagia are not general features of AT(1)-blockers, since neither was seen after normal or moderately supranormal doses, but they were, after the highest doses. These actions of AT(1)-blockers occur independently of their ability to lower blood pressure. They do depend on an intact leptin signalling, since they were absent in obese Zucker rats that feature a genetic mutation of the leptin receptor.
Cell transplantation is considered a novel approach in the treatment of myocardiopathy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of autologous mononuclear stem cell therapy in doxorubicin-induced dilated myocardiopathy by conducting both functional and histopathologic analysis.
Seventy male rats were doxorubicin injected intraperitoneally for 2 weeks. At 1 month, the animals that had demonstrated left ventricular ejection fractions less than 40% were randomly divided into a mononuclear stem cell group and controls. Mononuclear stem cells were isolated. All animals underwent echocardiographic study: baseline, pre-cell therapy, and at 1 month post-cell therapy, and analyzed by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. Transplants were performed by subepicardial injections. Standard staining was performed.
Twenty-three animals were randomly treated: mononuclear stem cell and control groups, with 11 rats completing the study. Cell viability was 85%. Mononuclear stem cells (n=5; 5x106 cells /300 microL medium) and control (n=6; 300 microL medium) were used. The resulting left ventricular ejection fraction in the cell therapy group was not significantly different compared with controls (p=0.54). New vessels were demonstrated in the subepicardial region.
Autologous mononuclear stem cell therapy was not functionally effective in doxorubicin-induced dilated myocardiopathy in the animal model under study with the experimental conditions, despite occurrence of angiogenic activity.
Although the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in acute kidney injury (AKI) has been documented, noninvasive early biomarkers of mitochondrial damage are needed. We examined urinary ATP synthase subunit β (ATPSβ) as a biomarker of renal mitochondrial dysfunction during AKI. Mice underwent sham surgery or varying degrees (5, 10, or 15 min ischemia) of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced AKI. Serum creatinine, BUN, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were elevated only in the 15 min I/R group at 24 h. Immunoblot analysis of urinary ATPSβ revealed two bands (full length ∼52 kDa and cleaved ∼25 kDa), both confirmed as ATPSβ by LC-MS/MS, that increased at 24 h in 10- and 15-min I/R groups. These changes were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction evidenced by reduced renal cortical expression of mitochondrial proteins, ATPSβ and COX1, proximal tubular oxygen consumption, and ATP. Furthermore, in the 15-min I/R group, urinary ATPSβ was elevated until 72 h before returning to baseline 144 h after reperfusion with recovery of renal function. Evaluation of urinary ATPSβ in a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis model of liver injury only revealed cleaved ATPSβ, suggesting specificity of full-length ATPSβ for renal injury. Immunoblot analyses of patient urine samples collected 36 h after cardiac surgery revealed increased urinary ATPSβ levels in patients with postcardiac surgery-induced AKI. LC-MS/MS urinalysis in human subjects with AKI confirmed increased ATPSβ. These translational studies provide evidence that ATPSβ may be a novel and sensitive urinary biomarker of renal mitochondrial dysfunction and could serve as valuable tool for the testing of potential therapies for AKI and chemical-induced nephrotoxicity.
Acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose is a leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF). When patients fulfill the King's College criteria for acetaminophen-induced ALF (AALF), they have a poor prognosis for survival without liver transplantation. Recent advances in artificial liver support have used albumin as a binding and scavenging molecule in ALF. One method, single-pass albumin dialysis (SPAD), involves dialyzing blood against an albumin-containing solution across a high-flux membrane to remove albumin-bound toxins. Herein, we describe our protocol for SPAD and report its use in a case of AALF as a bridge to native liver recovery.
A 41-year-old female with no documented history of liver disease presented with acute acetaminophen toxicity and developed hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy and lactic acidosis. The patient met King's College criteria for liver transplantation, based on pH and INR, but was deemed not suitable as a candidate due to psychosocial comorbidities. On day 3 of her ICU admission, she received the first of five consecutive daily runs (total ~77 hours) of SPAD. The patient's course was complicated by cerebral edema requiring mannitol. She was extubated on day 11 and transferred to the ward by day 13. At ICU discharge, her liver function (INR 1.9, bilirubin 435 mmol/L) and kidney function were recovering. She did not have any long-term neurological sequelae. By hospital discharge (day 46) her native liver function had recovered with a bilirubin <100mmol/L.
We describe a case of a patient with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure who was successfully bridged to spontaneous native liver recovery as a result of SPAD treatment. In patients with ALF, SPAD may be an additional intervention for temporary extracorporeal support. Further investigation in larger prospective studies is warranted.
A young woman with a history of in utero exposure to distilbestrol was diagnosed with vaginal clear-cell adenocarcinoma. Management consisted of limited excision of the tumor followed by brachytherapy after transposition of the ovaries. The patient had a successful pregnancy after reimplantation of the ovaries in their normal position and right adnexectomy for Chlamydia infection. The child was delivered by cesarean section. This is probably the first case with a pregnancy after repositioning of the ovaries in Europe and perhaps even in the world.
Sex differences in cocaine addiction warrants further research focused on examining the growing population of female cocaine addicts. As demonstrated in both clinical and preclinical research, females are more susceptible to drug relapse with anxiety being a contributing factor. In support of this, a recent clinical study from our laboratory highlights the importance of menstrual cycle phase and anxiety at treatment admission for cocaine addiction on treatment retention. In support of these trends in the clinical population, the purpose of the present study was to design an animal model to directly test the role of circulating hormone levels during cocaine withdrawal. To directly measure the influence of estrogen on anxiety-like behavior during early stages of withdrawal, both ovariectomized and intact female rodent models were employed. The elevated-plus maze and elevated-zero maze were used to assess anxiety-like behavior. Recent evidence in male rodents highlights a potential role for the delta opioid-receptor (DOR) system in the modulation of cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety. In addition to the evaluation of hormonal effects, a potential anxiolytic specific for DOR was tested for its efficacy in females withdrawn from cocaine. Our results support the use of DOR agonists as a potential anxiolytic in females and highlight the importance of estrogen and other circulating hormones during all phases of cocaine addiction.
This single-centre, double-blind, randomized parallel-group study compared ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP) and heart rate (HR) profiles and responses to orthostatic testing (OT) for recommended regimens of tamsulosin (TAM, modified release formulation) and terazosin (TER), two alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists that differ in their selectivity for alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes, pharmacokinetic properties and recommended posology for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO).
50 elderly normotensive male volunteers (mean age 68 years, range 61-78; 27 had LUTS) entered a single-blind 24-hour placebo run-in followed by a 15-day double-blind treatment in which the TER group received a 1-week treatment with 1 mg, then 1 week with 2 mg and finally a last dose of 5 mg, each dose administered once daily in the evening, while TAM subjects received 0.4 mg once daily after breakfast throughout. Subjects had AMBPs and OT while hospitalized on four occasions: during the placebo run-in and subsequent to the first dose of 1, 2 and 5 mg TER or at corresponding times under TAM. Regular OT (blood pressure after 5 min supine and after 2 min standing) was carried out between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m.; 'nocturial' OT took place whenever the subject had to leave the bed at night to void.
The baseline blood pressure values were slightly higher in the TAM group, but under treatment there was little difference between the treatments with regard to circadian changes in AMBP and HR. Under TER, there were 10 incidents of symptomatic hypotensive OT in 9 subjects (2 with syncope); furthermore, there were 24 events of asymptomatic exaggerated (> or = 20 mm Hg) decrease in systolic blood pressure in 12 subjects. With TAM in contrast, there was only 1 subject who experienced symptomatic hypotensive OT on 3 occasions (this subject had a previous history of vertigo and ought not to have been included); 7 subjects on TAM showed 16 incidents of asymptomatic hypotensive OT. The difference between TER and TAM was statistically significant for the number of subjects with positive symptomatic OT (p = 0.011).
Once-daily dosing of TAM after breakfast at a fixed dose level (0.4 mg) offers a more efficient protection against undesired cardiovascular extension effects in the normotensive elderly treated for LUTS suggestive of BPO than the usually recommended treatment schedule of TER with step-up doses (1-5 mg) administered at night.
There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels. However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure.
The present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning.
Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb-exposed children. Succimer treatment of the Pb-exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit. In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen.
These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure. These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children. However, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals.
3,2'-Dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) was administered s.c. to Syrian golden hamsters and CDF rats with and without disulfiram in the diet. In a group of male hamsters given only weekly injections of DMAB over a period of 18-22 months, 10 of 25 hamsters developed adenocarcinomas of the small or large intestine. Three had carcinomas in both the large and small intestine, 3 had only colon carcinomas and 4 only small intestinal carcinomas. In the group fed disulfiram and carcinogen, 10 of 25 hamsters developed adenocarcinomas of the colon, but only one carcinoma of the small intestine occurred. Furthermore, the appearance of intestinal tumors was delayed, Urinary bladder carcinomas occurred in both groups exposed to DMAB, with the appearance being slightly delayed in the group also receiving disulfiram. In male rats given DMAB s.c. once a week for 10 months, the addition of disulfiram in the diet reduced the incidence of cancers of the small intestine, similar to the effects of hamsters, but resulted in the occurrence of a small number of bladder cancers. An unusual occurrence was the development of prostatic carcinoma in rats given DMAB.
Settled dust has been used in studies to assess exposures to allergens and other biologically active components, but it has not been considered in the aggregate in relation to respiratory health outcomes in the general population.
We addressed whether total house dust weight, an index of total dust exposure, was associated with respiratory health outcomes in the National Survey of Lead and Allergens in Housing (1998-1999) (NSLAH).
NSLAH was a cross-sectional survey designed to represent permanently occupied housing units in the United States. In each household, a questionnaire was administered and settled dust was vacuumed from five locations. Linear regression models were used to identify predictors of dust weight; logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between dust weight and asthma and wheeze.
Dust weight samples were available for 829 households, and survey information was available for 2,456 participants (children and adults). Lower income, older homes, household pets, having a smoker in the house, and less frequent cleaning predicted higher dust weight levels in U.S. households. Higher levels of dust weight were associated with greater odds of current asthma and wheeze. The strongest associations were seen for wheeze [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.99; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21-3.28 for bedroom bed dust; OR = 2.81; 95% CI, 1.52-5.21 for upholstery dust). These associations persisted when adjusting for allergen and endotoxin exposures.
Dust weight, an index of total dust exposure in the home, may contribute to respiratory outcomes independently of the exposure to specific components.
Isoniazid is a widely used drug for the treatment of tuberculosis, but hepatotoxicity is a major concern during treatment. Thiopronin contains an SH-group and is generally considered an antioxidant. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of thiopronin during liver injury and DNA damage induced by isoniazid. Rats were injected daily with isoniazid (100 mg/kg, i.p.) for 21 days with or without thiopronin co-administration (60 mg/kg, i.p.) from day 11 to day 21. The influence of thiopronin on isoniazid-induced DNA oxidative damage was analyzed in precision-cut rat liver slices by HPLC-MS/MS. Thiopronin prevented isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity, indicated by both diagnostic indicators of liver damage (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) and histopathological analysis. In vivo, thiopronin significantly inhibited isoniazid-induced CYP2E1 activity as assessed by both chlorzoxazone hydroxylase and aniline hydroxylase (p<0.001). Thiopronin concentration-dependently inhibited CYP2E1-dependent aniline hydroxylation, and the Dixon plots suggest that thiopronin is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2E1. Thiopronin markedly attenuated isoniazid-induced inhibition of the detoxification system through cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), including mu GST and alpha GST. In precision-cut liver slices, the free radical scavenging activity of thiopronin reduced the generation of DNA adducts induced by isoniazid (p<0.05). Altogether, these results suggest that thiopronin exerts its hepatoprotective activity against isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting the production of free radicals in addition to its role as a scavenger. Thiopronin may reduce free radical generation via inhibition of hepatic CYP2E1 and increase the removal of free radicals directly or through the induction of cytosolic GSTs.
Patients experiencing stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at high risk for recurrent (secondary) strokes, which comprise 29% of all strokes in the United States. Current recommendations for prevention of secondary stroke from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) call for the broad use of platelet antiaggregation (antiplatelet) agents for patients with a history of noncardioembolic stroke or TIA. Five agents--aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP), and triflusal--have demonstrated efficacy in large-scale clinical studies in the prevention of recurrent vascular events and/or stroke in patients with a history of stroke. The results of the following studies are reviewed and compared: the Swedish Aspirin Low-Dose Trial (SALT), the United Kingdom Transient Ischaemic Attack (UK-TIA) Aspirin Trial, Dutch Transient Ischemic Attack (Dutch TIA) study (aspirin), the Canadian American Ticlopidine Study (CATS), the Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study (TASS), the African American Antiplatelet Stroke Prevention Study (AAASPS) (ticlopidine), the Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Recurrent Ischemic Events (CAPRIE) trial, the Management of Atherothrombosis With Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients study (MATCH) (clopidogrel), the second European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS2) (aspirin plus ER-DP), and the Triflusal versus Aspirin in Cerebral Infarction Prevention (TACIP) study. In comparative monotherapy studies of patients with previous stroke, ticlopidine demonstrates statistically significant improved efficacy over aspirin, and clopidogrel demonstrates nonsignificant slight improvement over aspirin for the prevention of ischemic cardiac and cerebrovascular events; however, the adverse event profile of ticlopidine (including rash, diarrhea, and neutropenia) will probably limit its long-term use. Among combination approaches, only aspirin plus ER-DP has demonstrated statistically significant, clinically meaningful additive benefit over monotherapy with each agent. Clopidogrel plus aspirin did not significantly improve preventive efficacy and increased the risk of serious side effects, including life-threatening bleeding episodes. The 15,500-patient PRoFESS (the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes) study, with results expected in 2008, will directly compare aspirin plus ER-DP with clopidogrel monotherapy for the prevention of recurrent stroke and should provide statistically robust estimates of comparative efficacy for the development of improved recommendations.
Insulin resistance in patients with type II diabetes has recently been treated with thiazolidinediones, a class of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists. However, these compounds are possibly associated with a significant increase in the risk of cardiovascular events. We examined the effect of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone on the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) that is the primary inhibitor of fibrinolysis in the liver of diabetic mice and cultured mouse and human hepatocytes. Concentrations of plasma PAI-1 and levels of its mRNA expression in the liver were significantly elevated in accordance with hepatic PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 mRNA accumulation in genetically diabetic db/db mice. An intraperitoneal injection of rosiglitazone significantly increased plasma PAI-1 concentrations in parallel with hepatic, but not with adipose mRNA levels in db/db mice, and did not affect these parameters in wild-type mice. Rosiglitazone as well as the PPARα agonist bezafibrate significantly induced PAI-1 mRNA expression in cultured mouse hepatocytes. Furthermore, both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone significantly induced, whereas bezafibrate did not affect PAI-1 mRNA expression in the human liver carcinoma cell line HepG2. The transient induction of PAI-1 gene expression mediated by PPARγ in the fatty liver might be involved in the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with thiazolidinediones in diabetic patients through decreasing fibrinolytic activity.
