Serotonergic receptor binding in the arcuate nucleus, n. raphé obscurus, and other medullary regions is decreased in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases. Further, a variable tandem repeat sequence polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter protein (5-HTT) gene has recently been associated with risk of SIDS in a Japanese cohort. This polymorphism differentially regulates 5-HTT expression, with the long allele (L), the SIDS-associated allele, being a more effective promoter than the short allele (S). We therefore investigated the 5-HTT promoter polymorphism in a cohort of 87 SIDS cases (43 African American and 44 Caucasian) and gender/ethnicity-matched controls. Significant positive associations were found between SIDS and the 5-HTT genotype distribution (P = 0.022), specifically with the L/L genotype (P = 0.048), and between SIDS and the 5-HTT L allele (P = 0.005). There was also a significant negative association between SIDS and the S/S genotype (P = 0.011). The comparisons were repeated in the African American and Caucasian subgroups. The data patterns were consistent in the subgroups, i.e., the L/L genotype and L allele were increased in the cases, but not all subgroup comparisons were statistically significant. These results indicate a relationship between SIDS and the L allele of the 5-HTT gene in African Americans and Caucasians, and if confirmed, will provide an important tool for identifying at-risk individuals and estimating the risk of recurrence.
Prostaglandins (PG), which are responsible for a large array of biological functions in eukaryotic cells, are produced from arachidonic acid by phospholipases and cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-1 and COX-2. We demonstrated that PG levels in cells were partly controlled by a regulatory protein, phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-activating protein (PLAA). Treatment of murine macrophages with lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased PLAA levels at early time points (2-30 min), which correlated with an up-regulation in cytosolic PLA2 and PGE2 levels. Both COX-2 and secretory PLA2 were also increased in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, however, at later time points of 4-24 h. The role of PLAA in eicosanoid formation in macrophages was confirmed by the use of an antisense plaa oligonucleotide. Within amino acid residues 503-538, PLAA exhibited homology with melittin, and increased PGE(2) production was noted in macrophages stimulated with melittin. In addition to PLA2, we demonstrated that activation of phospholipase C and D significantly controlled PGE2 production. Finally, increased antigen levels of PLAA, COX-2, and phospholipases were demonstrated in biopsy specimens from patients with varying amounts of intestinal mucosal inflammation, which corresponded to increased levels of phospholipase activity. These results could provide a basis for the development of new therapeutic tools to control inflammation.
In man, differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, related to ACE (I/D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis. This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats.
Renal ACE activity (Hip-His-Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested.
As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.22, NS). In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed.
Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin-induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain. This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage.
Possible involvement of endogenous opioids in humoral immune responses has been explored in the experimental animals. Opioid agonists like morphine and leu-enkephalin significantly enhanced antigen-induced histamine release from the peritoneal mast cells of sensitised rats in vitro; this was effectively antagonised by naloxone. Naloxone itself inhibited antigen-induced histamine release. Animals were effectively protected against anaphylactic shock by naloxone which also antagonised morphine-induced increase in anaphylactic mortality. Naloxone reduced haemagglutination titre to sheep red blood cells and IgE antibody titre as measured by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Thus, endogenous opioids appear to be involved in the mediation of humoral immune responses. They seem to act at various steps in the immune mechanism viz (i) antibody production and (ii) release of mediators of hypersensitivity reactions.
Although Lebanon is a highly polluted country, so far no study has specifically been designed to assess the association between outdoor air pollution and chronic bronchitis in this country.
To assess the association between exposure to outdoor air pollution and chronic bronchitis in Lebanon.
A pilot case-control study was conducted in two tertiary care hospitals. Cases consisted of patients diagnosed with chronic bronchitis by a pulmonologist and those epidemiologically confirmed. Controls included individuals free of any respiratory signs or symptoms. After obtaining informed consent, a standardized questionnaire was administered.
Bivariate, stratified (over smoking status and gender) and multivariate analyses revealed that passive smoking at home (ORa: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.73-3.80) and at work (ORa: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.13-3.17); older age (ORa: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.55-2.39); lower education (ORa: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.21-1.72); living close to a busy road (ORa: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.31-2.89) and to a local power plant (ORa: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.07-2.45); and heating home by hot air conditioning (ORa: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.00-3.43) were moderately associated with chronic bronchitis; an inverse association was found with heating home electrically (ORa: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.39-0.85). A positive dose-effect relationship was observed in those living close to a busy road and to a local diesel exhaust source.
Chronic bronchitis is associated with outdoor air pollution.
Lithium has been the standard pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder over the last 50 years; however, the molecular targets through which lithium exerts its therapeutic effects are still not defined. We characterized the phenotype of mice with a dysfunctional IMPA1 gene (IMPA1-/-) to study the in vivo physiological functions of IMPA1, in general, and more specifically its potential role as a molecular target in mediating lithium-dependent physiological effects. Homozygote IMPA1-/- mice died in utero between days 9.5 and 10.5 post coitum (p.c.) demonstrating the importance of IMPA1 in early embryonic development. Intriguingly, the embryonic lethality could be reversed by myo-inositol supplementation via the pregnant mothers. In brains of adult IMPA1-/- mice, IMPase activity levels were found to be reduced (up to 65% in hippocampus); however, inositol levels were not found to be altered. Behavioral analysis of the IMPA1-/- mice indicated an increased motor activity in both the open-field test and the forced-swim test as well as a strongly increased sensitivity to pilocarpine-induced seizures, the latter supporting the idea that IMPA1 represents a physiologically relevant target for lithium. In conclusion the IMPA1-/- mouse represents a novel model to study inositol homeostasis, and indicates that genetic inactivation of IMPA1 can mimic some actions of lithium.
Our study aimed at the identification of anti-inflammatory activities of different fractions of C. sadleriana extract after per os administration in rats, the identification of the active compounds of the plant and the investigation of the in vitro anti-inflammatory activities of Centaurea species native to or cultivated in the Carpathian Basin. The aerial parts of Centaurea sadleriana Janka have been used in Hungarian folk medicine to treat the wounds of sheep. Methanol extract of C. sadleriana was fractioned by solvent-solvent partitioning. The n-hexane fraction was further fractionated and the anti-inflammatory activities of certain subfractions were confirmed in vivo in rats. The n-hexane and chloroform fraction of the methanol extract of C. sadleriana exhibited remarkable COX-1 and COX-2 inhibiting effects in vitro. Chromatographic separation of the fractions led to the identification of the active subfractions and 11 compounds (α-linolenic acid, γ-linolenic acid, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, campesterol, vanillin, pectolinarigenin, salvigenin, hispidulin, chrysoeriol and apigenin). The in vitro screening for anti-inflammatory activities of further Centaurea species occurring in the Carpathian Basin (C. adjarica, C. bracteata, C. cataonica, C. cynaroides, C. dealbata, C. indurata, C. macrocephala, C. melitensis, C. nigrescens, C. ruthenica) revealed considerable COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activities. Because C. sadleriana is an endangered species native only to the Carpathian Basin, the investigation of more prevalent species is reasonable.
The hepatic tumorigenicity of CI-924 (5,5'-(1,1'-biphenyl)-2,5-diylbis(oxy)(2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid)), a hypolipidemic agent, was evaluated in 50 B6C3F1 mice/sex/dose given drug in the diet at 0, 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg/day for 2 yr. Peroxisomal and drugmetabolizing enzyme determinations, as well as ultrastructural evaluations, were conducted in subsets of these same groups, because drugs of this class cause peroxisome proliferation and hepatic tumors in rodents. CI-924 elicited dose-dependent increases in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in both sexes that were statistically significant at 75 mg/kg. Stereologic evaluation revealed significant increases in hepatocellular peroxisome volume ratio, due to increased numbers of peroxisomes, in females at all doses and males at 75 mg/kg. Peroxisomal enzyme activity measurements revealed no change in catalase, but dose-dependent increases in carnitine acetyltransferase and cyanide-insensitive beta-oxidation in both sexes. Peroxisome proliferation, determined biochemically or ultrastructurally, was twice as great in females compared to males. Total cytochrome P-450 was increased in both sexes given 75 mg/kg. There were dose-dependent decreases in glutathione S-transferase in males and increased glutathione peroxidase in both sexes at 25 and 75 mg/kg. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that while CI-924 induced hepatic tumors in male and female B6C3F1 mice the associated peroxisome proliferation, while moderate in females, was only weak in the males after 2 yr of exposure.
The most common cause of cardiac side effects of pharmaco-therapy is acquired long QT syndrome, which is characterized by abnormal cardiac repolarization and most often caused by direct blockade of the cardiac potassium channel human ether a-go-go-related gene (hERG). However, little is known about therapeutic compounds that target ion channels other than hERG. We have discovered that arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), a very potent antineoplastic compound for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, is proarrhythmic via two separate mechanisms: a well characterized inhibition of hERG/I(Kr) trafficking and a poorly understood increase of cardiac calcium currents. We have analyzed the latter mechanism in the present study using biochemical and electrophysiological methods. We find that oxidative inactivation of the lipid phosphatase PTEN by As(2)O(3) enhances cardiac calcium currents in the therapeutic concentration range via a PI3Kα-dependent increase in phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) production. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, even a modest reduction in PTEN activity is sufficient to increase cellular PIP(3) levels. Under control conditions, PIP(3) levels are kept low by PTEN and do not affect calcium current amplitudes. Based on pharmacological experiments and intracellular infusion of PIP(3), we propose that in guinea pig ventricular myocytes, PIP(3) regulates calcium currents independently of the protein kinase Akt along a pathway that includes a secondary oxidation-sensitive target. Overall, our report describes a novel form of acquired long QT syndrome where the target modified by As(2)O(3) is an intracellular signaling cascade.
To compare the vascular responses to hormone therapy in women with and without hot flushes.
We randomly assigned 143 healthy, recently postmenopausal women (mean age 52.4+/-0.2 years, time since menopause 19.5+/-0.9 months) with intolerable hot flushes (more than seven moderate/severe episodes per day) or tolerable hot flushes (fewer than three mild episodes per day) to receive 1 mg of transdermal estradiol gel, oral estradiol (2 mg) with and without daily medroxyprogesterone acetate, or placebo for 6 months. Vascular function was assessed by pulse-wave analysis and endothelial function testing with nitroglycerin and salbutamol challenges.
Hot flushes did not affect the changes in arterial or aortic stiffness or endothelial function in response to various forms of hormone therapy. However, in women with tolerable hot flushes, oral estradiol caused a decrease of 13.2% (P=.028) in the time to the first systolic peak (dependent on the rapid phase of ventricular ejection) after nitroglycerin. In addition, the time to the reflected wave (dependent on pulse-wave velocity) after nitroglycerin was decreased by 8.4% (P=.018). These effects were not seen in women with intolerable hot flushes or with the other treatment regimens.
Women without troublesome hot flushes are susceptible to unfavorable vascular effects after oral estrogen treatment, resulting in less compliant vasculature.

Glucocorticosteroids are administered antenatally and postnatally to decrease pulmonary morbidity of preterm neonates. One course of antenatal corticosteroids decreases mortality, and the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome and intraventricular hemorrhage. However, multiple courses may be associated with impaired brain development. Follow-up studies are needed to assess long-term consequences. The use of betamethasone may be of advantage compared to dexamethasone. Postnatally, steroids are given to treat or prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, recent studies have shown that treatment with dexamethasone increases the rate of cerebral palsy in preterm infants. Postnatal treatment of BPD with steroids should be restricted to life-threatening situations.
Oculogyric crisis is a neurologic reaction characterized by bilateral dystonic elevation of visual gaze as well as hyperextension of the neck. This reaction is most commonly explained as an adverse effect of numerous medications, such as dopamine receptor blocking agents or neuroleptic medications and traditional antipsychotic or antiemetic drugs, such as prochlorperazine or metoclopramide. A case of oculogyric crisis induced by metoclopramide is described in this paper.
The authors studied the effectiveness of neuroleptic high-dosage therapy in comparison to the electroshock treatment in the acute phase of systematic and unsystematic schizophrenia in a total of 75 patients. The results obtained show that the neuroleptic high-dosage therapy exceeds the effectiveness of the electroshock treatment mainly in the group of unsystematic schizophrenia.
Furan is a chemical used in some industrial products and occurs naturally in heat-treated foods. We aimed to investigate the effects of orally administered furan on liver and kidney in growing Wistar male rats for 90 days. In this respect, biochemical, morphological, histopathological, and histomorphometrical examinations were performed. Three- to 4-week aged rats were divided into five groups of eight animals each; control, oil control; 2, 4, 8 mg/kg/day furan treatment groups. At the end of the experiment, antioxidant enzyme activities and serum AST, ALT, HDL, Urea, etc. levels were analyzed. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also measured in liver homogenates. Also, liver and kidney were examined morphologically and histopathologically under light microscopy. According to the results of biochemical analysis, ALT, ALP, and LDL levels in treatment groups were significantly different compared with control groups. While LDL levels in treatment groups increased significantly, ALT and ALP levels decreased significantly. No significant changes were observed in liver MDA levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in treatment groups. While IL-6 levels did not change in treatment groups, furan caused dose-dependent increases in liver TNF-α level of rats. In treatment groups, absolute and relative liver weights changed significantly, however, no significant changes were observed in kidney and relative kidney weights. Hyperemic blood vessels in the liver and congestion, edema, fibrosis, and tubular damage in the kidney of rats treated with furan were observed histopathologically. According to histomorphometric examinations, glomeruli diameters and glomerular volume decreased in the kidneys of rats in treatment groups.
Calcific aortic valve disease is the most common heart valve disorder. So far, there is no medical treatment for calcific aortic valve disease. The expression of ectonucleotidases, which metabolize nucleotides into phosphate products, may influence the calcification of the aortic valve. In this study, we investigated if the administration of an ectonucleotidase inhibitor, ARL67156 (6-N,N-Diethyl-D-β,γ-dibromomethyleneATP trisodium salt), may prevent the calcification of the aortic valve in the warfarin-induced mineralization rat model. Male Wistar rats were treated with warfarin or warfarin+ARL67156 for 28 days. All rats had comprehensive Doppler-echocardiographic studies at 28 day. A gene profiling of ectonucleotidases expressed in aortas of rats was documented by quantitative real-time PCR. The amount of calcium was determined by quantitative method and von Kossa staining. Ex vivo cultures of rat aortas were also used to further assess the effect of ARL67156 on the calcifying process and Akt signaling. Mineralization of the aorta/aortic valve was documented in warfarin-treated rats and was accompanied by the development of aortic stenosis. These changes were paralleled by an increased of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1). Administration of the ectonucleotidase inhibitor, ARL67156 prevented the development of aortic stenosis by lowering the level of apoptosis and mineralization of the aortic valve/aorta. In addition, ARL67156 normalized the level of pAkt, an important kinase involved in the survival pathway. Inhibition of ectonucleotidase activity prevented the development of calcific aortic valve disease in a rat model. On that account, ectonucleotidase may represent a novel target in the treatment of calcific aortic valve disease.
To use myocardial perfusion imaging to determine the etiology of cocaine-induced chest pain in patients without ECG evidence of acute cardiac ischemia.
The authors conducted a prospective study of consecutive consenting patients aged 18-70 years with cocaine-induced chest pain who reported cocaine use within three days and presented with a chief complaint of chest pain occurring within three hours and lasting longer than 15 minutes with a normal or nondiagnostic ECG. Patients were excluded if they had a clear-cut noncardiac cause of chest pain, ECG evidence of acute cardiac ischemia, history of myocardial infarction, pregnancy, or lactation, required immediate hospitalization, or were unable to consent. Patients were injected with Tc-99m tetrofosmin and imaged. Perfusion scans were independently read by two nuclear radiologists. Clinicians blinded to scan results determined patient disposition. Patients with abnormal scans were asked to return for follow-up resting scans.
Fourteen patients were enrolled. Twelve of the 14 patients had chest pain at the time of Tc-99m tetrofosmin injection. Ten of the 14 [(71%) 95% CI = 48% to 95%] scans were normal or within normal limits. Four of the 14 [(29%) 95% CI = 5% to 52%] were abnormal. Of the four patients with abnormal scans, two had follow-up scans that demonstrated an irreversible perfusion abnormality, and two who did not return for follow-up reported no subsequent hospitalizations for acute cardiac ischemia.
Perfusion imaging did not demonstrate reversible ischemia in most patients (12/14, 86%) with cocaine-induced chest pain without ECG evidence of ischemia. These results suggest that cocaine-induced chest pain in most patients without ECG evidence of ischemia is not due to acute ischemia.
To assess the hemodynamic effects of Clonidine in hypertensive patients (pts) with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we administered the drug to 12 such patients either in a single bolus (75--150 micrograms in 5 min - 8 pts) or by continuous infusion (0.4--5 micrograms/min - 4 pts). Hemodynamic measurements were obtained by means of a Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter, before and 60 min after the administration of the drug. Clonidine did not significantly affected Heart Rate (from 80.5 +/- 3.9 to 78.4 +/- 5.9 beats/min), Mean Pulmonary Arterial Pressure (from 18.6 +/- 1.7 to 15.1 +/- 1 mmHg), Mean Pulmonary Wedge Pressure (from 12.5 +/- 1.1 to 10.6 +/- 0.7 mmHg), central Venous Pressure (from 4 +/- 0.8 to 3 +/- 0.9 mmHg), Cardiac Index (from 2.6 +/- 0.07 to 2.6 +/- 0.7 L/min/m2), Stroke Volume (from 65.2 +/- 2.8 to 68.5 +/- 5.5 ml/b). Conversely Mean Arterial Pressure fell significantly from 127 +/- 3.1 to 96.2 +/- 7.2 mmHg (P less than 0.001). Left Ventricular Systolic Work Index was reduced from 62.3 +/- 3.3 to 50.4 +/- 4.4 gm/beats/m2 (P less than 0.025), Total Systemic Resistances from 1888 +/- 50 to 1412 +/- 117 dyne sec cm-5 (P less than 0.005) and Tension Time Index from 3536 +/- 495 to 2389 +/- 385 x 10(3) mmHg x sec/min (p less than 0.05). Clonidine is a safe and useful drug to obtain a fall of high blood pressure often complicating AMI, without depressing left ventricular performance, as suggested by no significant changes of CI, WP and LVSWI. The reduction of TTI suggests a beneficial effect on the balance between myocardial oxygen delivery and demand. Clonidine is a hypotensive drug which can be safely used in patients with AMI, without depressing the left ventricular performance.
To study insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) imprinting in BWS (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth syndrome associated with Wilms and other embryonal tumours), we examined allele-specific expression using an Apal polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of IGF2. Four of six BWS fibroblast strains demonstrated biallelic expression, as did the tongue tissue from one of these patients. Paternal heterodisomy was excluded for all BWS patients with biallelic expression, suggesting strongly that the BWS phenotype in some patients involves disruption of IGF2 imprinting. Constitutional loss of IGF2 imprinting in a subgroup of our BWS patients, and recent reports of loss of imprinting in sporadic Wilms tumour, further strengthens the view that IGF2 overexpression plays an important role in somatic overgrowth and the development of embryonal tumours.
An 80-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus was treated with gliclazide. Prior to the gliclazide administration, her urinary excretion of albumin, serum urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were normal. After the medication, oliguria, edema and azotemia developed. On the twenty-fourth day when the edema was severe and generalized, gliclazide administration was terminated. On the following day urinary volume increased suddenly (5,740 ml/day). Polyuria persisted for five days. Edema improved and urea nitrogen and creatinine were normalized thereafter. Though the mechanism is not known, the clinical course suggests that gliclazide is the principal causative factor in the water retention and azotemia in this patient.
Portacaval shunt (PCS) prevent hepatotrophic factors from flowing into the liver, but they enter directly the systemic circulation and worsen liver injury. This study was designed to investigate the effects of hepatotrophic factors through the portal vein on the liver in rats with portal hypertension after portacaval shunt.
Intrahepatic portal hypertension (IHPH) was induced by intragastric administration of carbon tetrachloride, and end-to-side PCS was performed. Eight normal rats served as controls, and eight rats with IHPH served as IHPH model (IHPH group). Another 32 rats with IHPH-PCS were randomly subdivided into 4 groups: normal saline (NS) given to 8 rats, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) 8, insulin (INS) 8, hepatocyte growth factor and insulin (HGF + INS) 8. Hepatotrophic factors were infused into the portal vein through an intravenous catheter. Portal venous pressure (PVP) was measured. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were tested biochemically and those of hyaluronic acid (HA) and laminin (LN) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Hepatic fibrosis was assessed histologically and the expression of collagens type I and III were detected immunohistochemically. Ultrastructural change of hepatocytes and the number of mitochondria were observed under an electron microscope. The data were compared between groups and subgroups by Student-Newman-Keuls procedure with SPSS10.0.
PVP was significantly higher in the IHPH rats than in the control rats (P < 0.05). The levels of serum ALT, AST, HA, and LN, hepatic fibrosis score, the amount of collagen deposition, collagens type I and III increased more significantly in the IHPH group than in the control rats (P < 0.05). The number of mitochondria decreased more significantly in the IHPH rats than in the control rats (P < 0.05). The levels of serum ALT, AST, HA and LN as well as hepatic fibrosis score, the amount of collagen deposition, and the amount of collagens type I and III in the HGF and HGF + INS rats were significantly lower than those in the NS rats (P < 0.05). The damage to hepatocyte ultrastructure was markedly alleviated and the number of mitochondria was increased more significantly in the HGF and HGF + INS rats than in the NS rats under an electron microscope.
Perfusion of exogenous hepatotrophic factors through the portal vein can alleviate liver injury, minimize the damage to the ultrastructure of hepatocyte, protect liver function, and lessen hepatic fibrosis in rats with portal hypertension after PCS.
Bradycardia, an extremely rare side-effect of ranitidine therapy is described in a 4-day-old full-term male neonate, who was admitted because of massive gastro-intestinal bleeding. Two hours after the intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg body weight per day, ECG showed sinus bradycardia of 60 beats/min with normal axis and QRS complex. The bradycardia gradually resolved in the next 24 h.
Few published studies of the pathology of fenfluramine-phentermine (fen-phen) valvulopathy, described by Connolly and colleagues in 1997, have appeared.
To define temporal changes in the morphology of the stuck-on plaques and to determine whether the plaques progress or regress after cessation of fen-phen.
The available clinical information and pathology material from 35 aortic valves (AVs) and 43 mitral valves (MVs) from 64 patients were reviewed.
The valves fell into 3 groups: 17 AVs and 28 MVs had fen-phen lesions only, 2 AVs and 7 MVs had fen-phen changes associated with other valve diseases, and 16 AVs and 8 MVs had no fen-phen changes. Fenfluramine-phentermine-attributable dysfunction was regurgitation in all instances. Typical plaques showed proliferation of myofibroblastic cells with myxoid stroma. Small vascular channels and slight lymphocytic accumulations were often present. Deeper parts of some plaques had dense fibroelastic tissue underlying typical plaque.
Considerable individual variation in the time course of anorectic agent use and the severity of fen-phen valvulopathy was observed. Possible plaque regression could not be assessed from this study. The observations suggest that in some patients fen-phen-induced plaques may continue to have surface proliferation despite drug withdrawal.
