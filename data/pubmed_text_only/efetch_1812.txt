Female adrenal insufficiency implicates reduced production of the adrenal androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and low androgen levels. Oral DHEA restores androgen deficit but the clinical implications and safety of substitution therapy is uncertain. A putative DHEA receptor in vascular endothelium has been described and in vitro studies have shown involvement of DHEA in NO dependent pathways.
To evaluate effects of DHEA substitution on cardiovascular parameters.
Six months randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Treatment consisted of DHEA 50-mg or placebo. Each treatment period was followed by a 2-month washout period.
Ten females with documented adrenal failure were included. Androgen levels were measured. Cardiovascular evaluation was performed before and after every treatment period. Two patients left the study because of skin side effects and anxiety, respectively. All patients had low circulating androgens baseline and normal range androgens during DHEA treatment. We examined patients with noninvasive endothelial cell function, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based cardiac output, echocardiography, ambulatory 24-h blood pressure and maximal oxygen consumption.
DHEA treatment normalized androgen status to levels seen in healthy women. DHEA and placebo treatment had no effect on echocardiographic parameters of myocardial dimensions or systolic and diastolic function, noninvasive endothelial cell function at the level of the brachial artery, 24-h blood pressure and heart rate, cardiac output and maximal oxygen consumption during exercise cycle testing. Remarkably, all participants had evidence of concentric left ventricular remodelling by echocardiography.
Restoration of physiological androgen levels using 6 months of DHEA replacement in this pilot study did not affect cardiovascular parameters and endothelial function in female adrenal insufficiency.
Diethylnitrosamine (DENA, 10 mg kg-1 per day) was fed to rats for 2, 4 and 6 weeks. One week after the cessation of DENA, animals were submitted either to partial hepatectomy or to phenobarbital administration. Partial hepatectomy did not promote neoplastic transformation, except after a 6-week DENA treatment. A minimum of phenobarbital was required to reach a significant promoting effect in DENA carcinogenesis. A too-limited treatment was ineffectual but could be compensated for by prolonged DENA administration. The phenobarbital treatment became unnecessary when neoplastic nodules were present. Phenobarbital continuously given after the carcinogen administration promoted neoplastic transformation even after a subcarcinogenic DENA treatment (2 weeks). It accelerated the pathological evolution and increased the tumour incidence. In these conditions, phenobarbital increased the proliferation advantage of preneoplastic cells over normal cells. In the different experimental modalities, the promoting effect was associated with the induction of chronic cell proliferation, the inhibition of the rapid response to the 2/3 partial hepatectomy and the mitotic circadian rhythm normally present during liver regeneration. It is concluded that the promotion mechanism could consist in disturbing the mitotic control in order to maintain, for a long time, a chronic low level of cell proliferation permitting the selective growth of preneoplastic cells and their subsequent transformation.
In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) arterial vasodilators do not cause regression and might cause further progression of cardiac hypertrophy. To assess whether these effects extend to the vasculature, and to examine the possible mechanisms involved, cardiac and mesenteric arterial structure was evaluated with respect to changes in cardiac volume load and cardiac and arterial sympathetic activity during long-term (5- and 10-week) treatment of 16-week-old SHR with the arterial vasodilator minoxidil, alone or in combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide.
Despite causing a persistent decrease in blood pressure in SHR, minoxidil further increased left and right ventricular weights and left ventricular internal diameter. In combination with hydrochlorothiazide, minoxidil caused concentric, rather than eccentric, left ventricular hypertrophy. In the mesenteric arterial bed of SHR, minoxidil increased the lumen of the superior mesenteric artery, and prevented further increases in the medial area of the large and small mesenteric arteries. The increase in lumen size of the superior mesenteric artery by minoxidil was abolished when hydrochlorothiazide was added to the treatment. After 10 weeks' treatment with minoxidil, noradrenaline turnover rates were still significantly increased in the left ventricle but were decreased in the mesenteric arteries in the SHR. Minoxidil increased plasma and blood volumes, the increases being largely prevented by concomitant diuretic treatment.
We conclude that there are regional differences in the response of the cardiovascular system to minoxidil in SHR. Some of these differences may be related to differences in regional sympathetic activity, whereas volume load appears to play a modulatory role.
Intercellular cell adhesion molecules-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecules-1 (VCAM-1) are expressed in a high quantity on hepatocytes and at the level of endothelium cells from sinusoidal vessels in the liver tissue of patients with chronic hepatitis C. The soluble forms of these molecules sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 can be determined in the serum of patients through the immunoenzymatic technique (ELISA).
of the study was to analyse the base level of these molecules and the changes induced through the combined treatment of interferon-alpha (IFN- alpha) and ribavirin (Rib).
Twenty patients suffering from viral chronic hepatitis C were studied: 10 patients responded completely to antiviral treatment and 10 patients showed no response at the end of the treatment. At the end of the therapy patients were placed under biochemical observation for a further six months. The serum concentration of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 was measured using ELISA assay at the beginning and the end of the combined treatment: six months IFN 3MU (three times a week) associated with Rib.
Statistically, a significant correlation was observed between the values of sICAM-1 pretreatment and the level of viremia, gamma glutamiltrans-peptidase (GGT), but without correlation to the alanin amino transferase (ALT) level. The value of sICAM-1 was significantly higher in patients who had fibrosis score F: 3-4. After the treatment, the serum concentration of sICAM-1 dropped significantly in patients with sustained biochemical response in comparison to patients who had an unsustained response or had no response whatsoever. A significant correlation between the sVCAM-1 pre-treatment value and the level of viremia, GGT, ALT was not established.
The level of sICAM-1 could be a useful parameter in the observation of the disease evolution of patients with viral chronic hepatitis C treated with IFN-alpha and Rib.
Experimental evidences suggest a role of reactive oxygen species in gentamicin-induced nephropathy in rats. Therefore, we investigated if diallyl disulfide, a garlic-derived compound with antioxidant properties, has a renoprotective effect in this experimental model. Four groups of rats were studied: (1) control, (2) gentamicin treated subcutaneously with gentamicin (70 mg/kg/12 h/4 days), (3) diallyl disulfide treated intragastrically with diallyl disulfide (50 mg/kg/24 h/4 days), and (4) gentamicin + diallyl disulfide treated with gentamicin + diallyl disulfide. Gentamicin induced (a) nephrotoxicity, (b) increase in renal oxidative stress, and (c) decrease in the activity of manganese superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. Diallyl disulfide ameliorated these changes induced by gentamicin. The mechanism by which diallyl disulfide has a renoprotective effect in gentamicin-induced acute renal failure in rats may be related, at least in part, to the amelioration in the oxidative stress and the preservation in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes in kidney.
We tested formalin, chloramine-T-formalin and Desirox-formalin, for use against white spot disease (ichthyophthiriasis) caused by Ichthyophthirius multifiliis at 3 salmonid farms (Salmo salar and S. trutta smolt reared in earth ponds). I. multifiliis disappeared from most individuals 4 to 5 wk after the first treatment (and after the first I. multifiliis were found) with all chemicals, indicating that combinations of these chemicals, and even formalin alone, can be used to lower the parasite burden in earth ponds to such a level that no mortality occurs. This was the case when the fish were treated frequently at the beginning of the infection. Treatment can be stopped once the fish have achieved immunity to ichthyophthiriasis. The developing immunity was also revealed by the distribution of ciliates in the course of the disease. At the beginning of the infection I. multifiliis individuals were randomly distributed among the fish, but after 2 to 3 wk, when all the fish were infected, ciliates had increased in numbers and were aggregated in such a way that some fish carried quite heavy burdens. However, over 60% of the fish were free of the parasites after 4 to 5 wk, and had few or no ciliates, meaning that the distribution was even more aggregated. Sea trout had fewer parasites than salmon, and they also recovered from infection earlier even though the treatments and ponds were similar, indicating variation in resistance to I. multifiliis between fish species. It was also evident that the chemicals and their concentrations must be planned carefully to suit the conditions at each farm.
The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of quercetin-rich onion peel extract (OPE) on anti-differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and the antiobesity in high-fat fed rats. We found that lipid accumulations and TG contents in 3T3-L1 cells were markedly suppressed by OPE. The mRNA levels of activating protein (AP2) were down-regulated and those of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 α (CPT-1α) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) were up-regulated by 75 and 100 μg/ml OPE. Body weight, retroperitoneal and mesenteric fat weights of SD rats were significantly lower in the 8 week high fat (HF) diet+0.72% OPE group than in the HF group. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ mRNA levels were down-regulated in the epididymal fat of OPE than those of control and HF, and significant down-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)α mRNA levels in OPE was also observed than the control. The mRNA levels of CPT-1α and uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) were up-regulated by the OPE, while those of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) were down-regulated in HF and OPE groups compared to control group. These results suggest that quercentin-enriched OPE may have antiobesity effects by suppressing preadipocyte differentiation and inhibiting adipogenesis.
A young woman taking oral contraceptives presented with acute, severe abdominal pain. A liver-cell adenoma (weight 1.6 kg), with intrahepatic bleeding and necrosis, was enucleated at elective laparotomy. The clinical presentation of liver-cell adenoma, ranging from incidental finding to sudden death, is reviewed and the evidence linking oral contraceptives to the tumour is discussed. Reported cases of symptomatic liver-cell adenoma have numerically declined in the past decade. Acute surgical treatment is indicated only to control bleeding. In addition to withdrawal of oral contraceptive medication, enucleation of the tumour or hepatic resection is generally recommended as elective, definitive treatment.
Ocular sympathetic function, facial flushing and the presence or absence of lachrymation and rhinorrhoea were examined in 30 patients during spontaneous or nitroglycerin-induced cluster headache. In 27 cases measurements were also obtained during the headache-free interval. Ocular sympathetic function was impaired on the symptomatic side between cluster attacks and function was reduced further during cluster headache. Greater heat loss from the orbital region on the symptomatic side was associated with ocular sympathetic dysfunction both during and between attacks, and with lachrymation during attacks. Heat loss from the cheek and side of the nose was greater on the symptomatic side in patients whose attack was accompanied by lachrymation, but heat loss from these areas was unrelated to the extent of ocular sympathetic deficit. These findings suggest that parasympathetic overactivity in the greater superficial petrosal nerve provokes facial flushing and lachrymation. Parasympathetic overactivity could also cause dilatation of the internal carotid artery and compression of the periarterial plexus of sympathetic fibres, producing a sympathetic deficit with release of vasoconstrictor tone in the eye. Thus autonomic disturbances in cluster headache may be explained by the unitary hypothesis of parasympathetic hyperactivity being responsible for ocular sympathetic deficit.
In tests conducted on 220 rats with transplantable sarcoma M-1 and intact animals acute toxicity, antineoplastic effect and the action on the blood system of tomizine, a new neoplastic drug of the group of the folic acid antagonists, were studied. Investigation involved a single intraperitoneal injection of the drug in DL50/30 and MTD. The compound is shown to exert an inhibiting action on the development of sarcoma M-1 and lengthens the survival of the tumour-stricken animals, without producing any pronounced myelotoxic effect. The disclosed shifts on the level of the periphedal blood and marrow were short-lived and concerned mainly the erythroid germ cells.
From September 1984 to July 1986, 70 previously untreated patients with Stage II to IV intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (according to the International Working Formulation) were enrolled in a phase III comparative trial. The objectives of the study were to compare the efficacy and safety of using mitoxantrone instead of doxorubicin in the combination chemotherapeutic regimen m-BACOD (intermediate-dose methotrexate, bleomycin, Adriamycin [doxorubicin, Adria Laboratories], cyclophosphamide, Oncovin [vincristine, Eli Lilly and Company], and dexamethasone). Seventy patients were randomly assigned to receive either m-BN (Novantrone; mitoxantrone, American Cyanamid Company) COD or m-BACOD. The complete-response rate was 57% in both treatment groups, and no significant differences in overall or relapse-free survival were recorded between the two groups. Patients treated with m-BACOD experienced severe alopecia more frequently (P less than .001) and reported six adverse cardiac events of grade greater than 1 whereas neither was observed among those receiving m-BNCOD. The mitoxantrone-containing regimen was found to have an equivalent efficacy and reduced clinical toxicity in comparison to the standard doxorubicin-containing regimen in patients with poor-prognosis non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
Chronic neck pain can be a difficult problem to evaluate and treat, as it can have several different causes. We studied a series of patients with neck pain near the superomedial aspect of the scapula that was referred pain from inflammation of the shoulder secondary to chronic impingement. We postulate that some patients with specific clinical findings and neck pain can benefit from treatment of shoulder impingement.
We conducted a retrospective review of the charts of thirty-four patients with neck pain who met three criteria for the diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome: (1) a positive impingement sign with pain referred to the neck, (2) radiographic abnormalities, and (3) relief of neck pain after injection of lidocaine and cortisone into the subacromial space. Subjective pain scores were determined before and after the injection.
Thirty of the thirty-four patients obtained immediate relief of the neck pain following injection into the subacromial space, and the remaining four had substantial pain relief when they were evaluated three weeks following the injection. Avoidance of the shoulder impingement position (forward elevation of the arm above 90 degrees ) subsequently minimized recurrences.
In selected patients, chronic neck pain may be caused by shoulder impingement, which can be easily diagnosed with standard techniques. The difficulty in making this diagnosis is that the patient presents with neck pain rather than with the typical shoulder pain. The differential diagnosis of chronic lower neck pain should include shoulder impingement syndrome, which can be identified by classic physical and radiographic signs and can be treated with injection into the subacromial space and avoidance of the shoulder impingement position.
Disulfiram is known to produce toxic encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy. The case of a 37-year-old alcoholic who attempted to commit suicide by taking 22.5 g disulfiram is described. During the first 6 days after the intoxication he was stuporous and had cerebellar ataxia and dysarthric speech. Then he became comatose, and as he recovered from coma, he showed peripheral neuropathy including diplegia faciei and severe tetraparesis. Denervation potentials were detected in both facial muscles and distal muscles of the upper and lower limbs, while conduction velocity was normal. Axonal degeneration was verified by sural nerve biopsy. In addition neurofilamentous axonopathy was documented. The recovery from his paresis lasted 2 years.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a plasticizer and an endocrine-disrupting chemical. It is present in a variety of products used daily including food containers, paper, and dental sealants and is now widely detected in human urine and blood. Exposure to BPA during development may affect brain organization and behavior, perhaps as a consequence of its actions as a steroid hormone agonist/antagonist and/or an epigenetic modifier. Here we show that BPA produces transgenerational alterations in genes and behavior. Female mice received phytoestrogen-free chow with or without BPA before mating and throughout gestation. Plasma levels of BPA in supplemented dams were in a range similar to those measured in humans. Juveniles in the first generation exposed to BPA in utero displayed fewer social interactions as compared with control mice, whereas in later generations (F(2) and F(4)), the effect of BPA was to increase these social interactions. Brains from embryos (embryonic d 18.5) exposed to BPA had lower gene transcript levels for several estrogen receptors, oxytocin, and vasopressin as compared with controls; decreased vasopressin mRNA persisted into the F(4) generation, at which time oxytocin was also reduced but only in males. Thus, exposure to a low dose of BPA, only during gestation, has immediate and long-lasting, transgenerational effects on mRNA in brain and social behaviors. Heritable effects of an endocrine-disrupting chemical have implications for complex neurological diseases and highlight the importance of considering gene-environment interactions in the etiology of complex disease.
Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) may decrease myocardial tissue oxygenation in dogs with normal coronary arteries. We compared SNP- with desflurane-induced hypotension on myocardial tissue oxygen and pH in dogs with left anterior descending artery constriction.
Twenty-four dogs were anesthetized with 8% desflurane for baseline anesthesia. Catheters were inserted into the femoral artery and vein and the coronary sinus. A flow probe and flow restriction device was placed on the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. A probe that measured myocardial oxygen pressure was inserted into the middle myocardium in the LAD region. Baseline measures were made of LAD artery flow, arterial and coronary sinus blood gases, and myocardial tissue gases. A 30% decrease in blood pressure was induced with SNP with unrestricted LAD flow (n=6) or when LAD artery flow was restricted by 30% from baseline (n=6). In separate dogs, a 30% decrease in blood pressure was produced with 14 +/- 1% desflurane with unrestricted LAD flow (n=6) or with baseline LAD artery flow restricted by 30% (n=6).
During SNP-induced hypotension with no LAD constriction, LAD artery flow and coronary sinus oxygen tension increased but myocardial tissue oxygen tension (PmO2) decreased by 40%. When baseline artery flow was decreased by 30% by LAD constriction, SNP-induced hypotension decreased tissue oxygen pressure by 80%, and ischemic acidosis was produced. During unrestricted LAD artery flow or with a 30% flow restriction, desflurane-induced hypotension produced no significant change from baseline myocardial tissue oxygen tension or pH.
During coronary artery constriction, desflurane-induced hypotension maintained myocardial tissue oxygenation and pH better than did SNP-induced hypotension. The divergence between tissue and coronary sinus oxygen tension during SNP suggests that arteriovenous shunting may occur.
Acute heart failure is a potentially fatal manifestation of viral myocarditis. Development of myocardial damage in myocarditis involves cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Levosimendan is a novel calcium sensitizing inotropic agent with anti-apoptotic properties. We studied the feasibility of inotropic treatment with levosimendan and its effects on apoptosis in experimental acute heart failure caused by coxsackievirus myocarditis.
Adolescent BALB/c mice were infected with myocarditic Woodruff variant of coxsackievirus B3 (2 x 10(4) plaque-forming units). Mice were randomized into those receiving levosimendan 0.33 mg kg(-1) (total dose 1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) (n = 20) or vehicle (n = 19) given orally by gauge three times a day for 7 days after infection. Left ventricular function was evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography and the mice were euthanized on day 7. Histopathology, amount of virus in the heart (virus titration assay) and cardiomyocyte apoptosis (TUNEL assay) were studied. Uninfected untreated control mice were also studied.
Infection resulted in histopathologically severe myocarditis and significant impairment of left ventricular function. Levosimendan treatment significantly improved ventricular function (fractional shortening 0.32 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.05, P = 0.005; contractility 0.60 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.14, P = 0.007 and myocardial performance index 0.36 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.62 +/- 0.15, P < 0.0001) compared with vehicle. Levosimendan also reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (0.26 +/- 0.08% vs. 0.44 +/- 0.15% in vehicle, P = 0.008), but did not have an effect on areas of myocardial necrosis or inflammation, or the amount of virus in the heart. Levosimendan treatment did not affect mortality (total mortality 63%). CONCLUSIONS; Levosimendan improves ventricular function and inhibits cardiomyocyte apoptosis; therefore, it is suggested as a potentially feasible therapy in acute heart failure caused by viral myocarditis.
To describe the methods, success rates, and immediate complications of tracheal intubations performed in the emergency department of an urban teaching hospital.
This was an observational, consecutive series undertaken in an urban university hospital with an emergency medicine residency training program and an annual ED census of 60,000 patients. The study population included all patients for whom intubation was attempted in the ED during a 1-year period (July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996). At the time of each intubation, the intubator filled out an intubation data collection form. If an intubation was performed in the ED but no form was filled out, the data were obtained from the medical record.
A total of 610 patients required airway control in the ED; 569 (93%) were intubated by emergency medicine residents or attending physicians. Rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) was used in 515 (84%). A total of 603 patients (98.9%) were successfully intubated; 7 patients could not be intubated and underwent cricothyrotomy. In 33 patients, inadvertent placement into the esophagus occurred; all such situations were rapidly recognized and corrected. Eight (24%) of the 33 esophageal intubations resulted in a reported immediate complication. Overall, 49 patients (8.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6% to 11%) experienced a total of 57 immediate complications (9.3%; 95% CI, 7% to 12%). Three patients sustained a cardiac arrest after intubation; two of these patients had agonal rhythms before intubation, and one probably had a succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemic cardiac arrest.
At this institution, the majority of ED intubations were performed by emergency physicians and RSI was the most common method used. Emergency physicians intubated critically ill and injured ED patients with a very high success rate and a low rate of serious complications.
One of the reasons for suboptimal blood pressure (BP) control in patients with hypertension is poor adherence to treatment, which may be caused by treatment-emergent adverse events. Therefore, it is crucial for an antihypertensive agent to provide a high level of efficacy without compromising tolerability.
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a titrate-to-goal, olmesartan medoxomil-based therapy in patients with stage 1 hypertension (seated systolic BP [SeSBP] of 140-159 mmHg or seated diastolic BP [SeDBP] of 90-99 mmHg).
This was a pre-specified analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre (29 sites) clinical study conducted from January to October 2007 in the US. Male and female patients (n = 130) aged >or=18 years with stage 1 hypertension were included in the analysis. Patients were treated with either placebo or an olmesartan medoxomil-based titration regimen, which comprised treatment with olmesartan medoxomil plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as required to achieve a target BP of <120/80 mmHg. The current analysis focused on the safety of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with stage 1 hypertension, particularly in terms of discontinuation rates and the incidence of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension. Safety and tolerability were assessed throughout the study. The primary efficacy outcome was the least-squares (LS) mean change from baseline in SeSBP after 12 weeks' double-blind treatment. Additional efficacy variables included LS mean change from baseline in SeDBP at 12 weeks and the proportions of patients achieving BP goals at study end and at each titration step.
In patients with stage 1 hypertension, the olmesartan medoxomil-based regimen was generally well tolerated at all titration steps, and discontinuation due to adverse events was similar between olmesartan medoxomil and placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 16.1% up to 27.6% of olmesartan medoxomil recipients and between 8.3% and 24.3% of placebo recipients, across treatment regimens; a slight increase in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was observed with olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ versus olmesartan medoxomil alone (<or=27.6% vs <or=19.3%). In addition, one or more drug-related events were reported in up to 10.3% of olmesartan medoxomil recipients and up to 5.7% of placebo recipients. Gastrointestinal disorders (<or=10.0%), nervous system disorders (<or=10.3%), and infections/infestations (<or=7.1%) were the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events in the olmesartan medoxomil treatment group. The most common nervous system disorders in the olmesartan medoxomil treatment group were dizziness (<or=6.9%) and headache (<or=5.4%). Orthostatic hypotension was not reported. The LS mean differences between olmesartan medoxomil and placebo for change from baseline in SeSBP (-22.0 mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI] -26.9, -17.3) and SeDBP (-12.2 mmHg; 95% CI -14.9, -9.4; both p < 0.0001) significantly favoured olmesartan medoxomil at week 12 with last observation carried forward. At study end, a BP goal of <140/90 mmHg was achieved by 81.0% of patients in the olmesartan medoxomil group versus 43.1% of patients in the placebo group (p < 0.0001).
Olmesartan medoxomil-based therapy was well tolerated in this study among patients with stage 1 hypertension and demonstrated a placebo-like safety and tolerability profile. This regimen was also effective in terms of BP lowering and enabling patients to achieve BP goals without an adverse effect on tolerability.
Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are more prevalent after liver transplantation with cyclosporine as the primary immunosuppressive agent compared with tacrolimus. To determine whether blood pressure, serum lipid level, or weight improves when patients switch immunosuppression therapy, we retrospectively studied 26 liver transplant recipients with stable graft function who had been converted from cyclosporine to tacrolimus therapy with a median follow-up of 8 months. One of the 26 patients developed pruritus necessitating withdrawal of tacrolimus. The results therefore concern the remaining 25 patients. With the exception of a small decrease in bilirubin level (P <.05), there was no difference in graft or renal function after conversion. Mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 158 +/- 25 to 148 +/- 22 mm Hg over a mean of 8 +/- 3 months after conversion to tacrolimus (P =.015), whereas mean serum cholesterol level decreased from 5.3 +/- 0.9 to 4.9 +/- 0.9 mmol/L (P =.01). Sixty-eight percent of the patients lost weight, from a mean of 79.4 +/- 22.6 to 76.1 +/- 20.1 kg, in the 11 months after switching to tacrolimus therapy (P =.024). Serum triglyceride and blood glucose levels did not change, and no patient developed diabetes mellitus after conversion. These results indicate that switching from cyclosporine to tacrolimus can reduce blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, and weight after liver transplantation.
Amoxicillin is a widely prescribed antibiotic that might rarely cause severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals. Acute cardiac emergencies are quite uncommon in the setting of drug allergies. Here we report the emergency management and IVUS study of a 40-year-old female patient presented with severe allergy resulting in myocardial infarction after oral amoxicillin intake.
Dysfunction of protein handling has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases and inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has been linked to the formation of protein aggregates and proteinopathies in such diseases. While proteasomal inhibition could trigger an array of downstream protein handling changes including up-regulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), induction of molecular chaperones, activation of the ER stress/unfolded protein response (UPR), autophagy and aggresome formation, little is known of the relationship of proteasomal inhibition to the sequence of activation of these diverse protein handling systems. In this study we utilized the reversible proteasome inhibitor MG132 and examined the activity of several major protein handling systems in the immortalized dopaminergic neuronal N27 cell line. In the early phase (up to 6h after proteasomal inhibition), MG132 induced time-dependent proteasomal inhibition which resulted in stimulation of the UPR, increased autophagic flux and stimulated heat shock protein response as determined by increased levels of phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)/GADD153, turnover of autophagy related microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and increased levels of Hsp70 respectively. After prolonged proteasomal inhibition induced by MG132, we observed the formation of vimentin-caged aggresome-like inclusion bodies. A recovery study after MG132-induced proteasomal inhibition indicated that the autophagy-lysosomal pathway participated in the clearance of aggresomes. Our data characterizes the relationship between proteasome inhibition and activation of other protein handling systems. These data also indicated that the induction of alternate protein handling systems and their temporal relationships may be important factors that determine the extent of accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells as a result of proteasome inhibition.
To assess the pharmacological profile of AS1892802, a novel and selective Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, we examined the effects of repeated dosing with AS1892802 on models of monoiodoacetate-induced arthritis and streptozotocin-induced neuropathy. Although single dosing of AS1892802 exerted a short-acting, moderate analgesic effect, repeated dosing exhibited a long-lasting and more potent analgesic effect in both models. Furthermore, the analgesic effect was sustained for seven days after the last administration. These results suggest that peripheral ROCK plays a crucial role in chronic pain maintenance and that AS1892802 may be useful in treating chronic pain.
Marfan syndrome is an extracellular matrix disorder with cardinal manifestations in the eye, skeleton and cardiovascular systems associated with defects in the gene encoding fibrillin (FBN1) at 15q21.1 (ref. 1). A second type of the disorder (Marfan syndrome type 2; OMIM 154705) is associated with a second locus, MFS2, at 3p25-p24.2 in a large French family (family MS1). Identification of a 3p24.1 chromosomal breakpoint disrupting the gene encoding TGF-beta receptor 2 (TGFBR2) in a Japanese individual with Marfan syndrome led us to consider TGFBR2 as the gene underlying association with Marfan syndrome at the MSF2 locus. The mutation 1524G-->A in TGFBR2 (causing the synonymous amino acid substitution Q508Q) resulted in abnormal splicing and segregated with MFS2 in family MS1. We identified three other missense mutations in four unrelated probands, which led to loss of function of TGF-beta signaling activity on extracellular matrix formation. These results show that heterozygous mutations in TGFBR2, a putative tumor-suppressor gene implicated in several malignancies, are also associated with inherited connective-tissue disorders.
Two patients with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia sustained massive fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage from rupture of the basilar artery wall. Hemorrhage from this entity is not widely known to occur during its natural history and may be exacerbated by systemic anticoagulation.
Two patients presented with ischemic events of the brain stem, which were attributed to vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. The diagnosis was made on the basis of computed tomography and subsequent angiography.
Both patients were treated with systemic anticoagulation with heparin and subsequently experienced massive fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autopsy results confirmed the cause of hemorrhage to be frank rupture of the basilar artery wall.
Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia is a formidable structural entity afflicting the posterior circulation, which is generally thought to cause symptoms as a result of either compression of the adjacent brain stem and/or cranial nerves or ischemic events caused by thrombosis and perforator occlusion. Our experience with these two patients indicates that some lesions can hemorrhage, which is a factor that must be weighed when considering treatment alternatives.
