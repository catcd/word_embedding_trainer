We hypothesized that hypoxia induced testicular damage is mediated by an activated NADPH oxidase (NOX), therefore, APO (apocynin) an inhibitor of NOX and raisanberine (RS), a calcium influx inhibitor were tested if they could attenuate hypoxic toxicity to the testis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to hypoxia (10±0.5% O₂) for 17d and intervened with APO and RS in the last 6d. Histological changes and expression of pro-inflammation factors were evaluated in vivo. Biomarkers in isolated Leydig cells incubated with H₂O₂ were also assayed in vitro. Hypoxic rats displayed lower serum testosterone and higher LH and FSH. Upregulation of p22/p47(phox), NOX2, MMP9, PERK and p66Shc was associated with downregulation of StAR, 3β-HSD and Cx43 in the hypoxia testis, revealed by Western blot and immunohistochemical assay, respectively. APO and RS at least partially normalize hypoxia caused male hypogonadism by suppressing ER stress, and p66Shc in testes.
Opioid receptor antagonists have been shown to attenuate the rewarding and addictive effects of cocaine. Furthermore, cocaine has been shown to cause the release of beta-endorphin, an endogenous opioid peptide.
We assessed whether this neuropeptide would play a functional role in cocaine-induced motor stimulation and conditioned place preference (CPP).
Mice lacking beta-endorphin and their wild-type littermates were habituated to motor activity chambers for 1 h, then injected with cocaine (0, 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or morphine (0, 5, or 10 mg/kg, subcutaneously), and motor activity was recorded for 1 h. In the CPP paradigm, mice were tested for baseline place preference on day 1. On days 2 and 3, mice received an alternate-day saline/cocaine (15, 30, or 60 mg/kg) or saline/morphine (10 mg/kg) conditioning session and then tested for postconditioning place preference on day 4.
Cocaine-induced motor stimulation and CPP were both reduced in mice lacking beta-endorphin. On the other hand, motor stimulation and CPP induced by morphine were not altered in mutant mice.
The present results demonstrate that the endogenous opioid peptide beta-endorphin plays a modulatory role in the motor stimulatory and rewarding actions of acute cocaine.
Ketamine induces effects resembling both positive and negative psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. These are thought to arise through its action as an uncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.
We used [(123)I]CNS-1261 to study ketamine binding to NMDA receptors in healthy human controls in vivo and its relationship to positive and negative psychotic symptom induction.
Ten healthy controls underwent two single-photon emission tomography scans with [(123)I]CNS-1261. On each occasion, they received a bolus infusion of either ketamine or saline. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was administered at the end of each scan. Predefined regions of interest were used to estimate change in volume of distribution of [(123)I]CNS-1261 following ketamine administration. Two normalised-to-cortex binding indices were also used in order to study effects of ketamine on NMDA receptor availability by region, after correction for global and nonspecific effects.
Ketamine-induced reduction in [(123)I]CNS-1261 volume of distribution in all regions showed the strongest correlation with BPRS negative subscale (p < 0.01). With the normalised-to-cortex measures, NMDA receptor binding in middle inferior frontal cortex showed a significant correlation with BPRS negative subscale (BI1 r = 0.88, BI2 r = 95.9, p < 0.001).
[(123)I]CNS-1261 binding was modulated by ketamine, a drug known to compete for the same site on the NMDA receptor in vitro. Ketamine may induce negative symptoms through direct inhibition of the NMDA receptor, and positive symptoms may arise through a different neurochemical pathway.
Although intravitreal aminoglycosides have substantially improved visual prognosis in endophthalmitis, macular infarction may impair full visual recovery.
We present a case of presumed amikacin retinal toxicity following treatment with amikacin and vancomycin for alpha-haemolytic streptococcal endophthalmitis.
Endophthalmitis resolved with improvement in visual acuity to 6/24 at three months. Fundus fluorescein angiography confirmed macular capillary closure and telangiectasis.
Currently accepted intravitreal antibiotic regimens may cause retinal toxicity and macular ischaemia. Treatment strategies aimed at avoiding retinal toxicity are discussed.
The present study investigated the cytotoxic activity of ethanol extract of onion peel (OPE) in HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed to determine the amounts of phenolic acids and flavonoids in OPE. In addition, the influence of OPE on antioxidant- and inflammation-associated gene expression was also determined in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated HT-29 cells. HPLC analysis showed that OPE contained well-known antioxidant compounds, including p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, epicatechin, and morin. After incubation with OPE, HT-29 cells showed either a loss of normal nuclear architecture or detachability from each other. The cytotoxic effects of OPE on HT-29 cells were confirmed by MTT and LDH release assays. LPS-induced oxidative conditions effectively downregulated TNF-α mRNA expression in OPE pretreated HT-29 cells compared with cells only stimulated with LPS. In addition, the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) detoxification genes (i.e., GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) was upregulated after treatment with LPS at sublethal concentrations. However, the LPS-induced mRNA expression of HO-1 and GSTs was significantly attenuated by treatment with OPE. Therefore, onion peel extract is a promising component of future nutraceuticals and value-added products.
Two patients with chronic renal failure developed transient sinus node dysfunction requiring insertion of a temporary pacemaker while receiving procainamide to control ventricular arrhythmias. Blood levels of procainamide were found to be elevated, although at these levels, sinus node dysfunction has not previously been reported. Following discontinuance of procainamide, sinus rhythm returned. A combination of factors, including elevated levels of N-acetyl procainamide, the metabolite of procainamide with anti-arrhythmic properties, are suggested as possible contributory causes for the ECG findings. Thus, procainamide may produce electrophysiologic features of "sick sinus syndrome" in patients with chronic renal failure even when blood levels of this substance are being monitored.
The US FDA-approved thalidomide for the treatment of chronic recurrent/severe erythema nodosum leprosum. Thalidomide is also useful in many other inflammatory dermatological conditions where patients have exhausted other treatment options.
The beneficial and adverse clinical effects of thalidomide were studied in 25 patients suffering from different inflammatory dermatological conditions that were poorly controlled with conventional therapies.
Thalidomide was found to be effective in various inflammatory dermatological diseases other than chronic recurrent erythema nodosum leprosum such as Behçet's disease, disseminated and hypertrophic discoid lupus erythematosus, erosive lichen planus, discoid lupus erythematosus-lichen planus overlap, recurrent aphthous stomatitis and prurigo nodularis. Deep vein thrombosis due to thalidomide occurred in 20% of these patients and appears to be a significant side effect.
Thalidomide appears promising in a number of inflammatory dermatological conditions and will probably find new usages in future. The treating physicians need to be wary of the thrombo-embolic complications due to thalidomide especially when glucocorticoids or other chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil or dexamethasone-cyclophosphamide pulse therapy are being used concomitantly, and in patients of metastatic renal carcinoma, myelodysplastic syndrome or multiple myeloma receiving thalidomide/chemotherapy. Antiphospholipid or anticardiolipin antibodies appear to be other possible risk factors for this complication.
Four muscarinic receptor antagonists with varying selectivities for the four pharmacologically-defined muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1-M4) were administered into the lateral ventricle to determine their relative potency in reducing tremulous jaw movements induced by i.p. injection of the muscarinic receptor agonist pilocarpine (4.0 mg/kg). All four muscarinic receptor antagonists reduced tremulous jaw movements in a dose-dependent manner, with the following rank order of potency: scopolamine > methoctramine > or = telenzepine > pirenzepine. This pattern is inconsistent with the rank order of affinity of these agents at the muscarinic M1 receptor, and is consistent with their rank order of affinity at muscarinic M2 or M4 receptors. Because tremulous jaw movements are related to striatal function, and the muscarinic M4 receptor is more predominant than the muscarinic M2 receptor as a post-synaptic receptor in striatum, the present results suggest that pilocarpine induces jaw movements due to muscarinic M4 receptor stimulation. In view of the hypothesized relation between parkinsonism and cholinomimetic-induced jaw movements, these data suggest that a centrally-acting muscarinic M4 receptor antagonist could be useful as an antiparkinsonian agent.
Although the atypical antipsychotic medications appear to be safe in patients with epilepsy, few studies have specifically addressed the use of risperidone in children with seizures. The objective of this study was to evaluate behavior improvement and seizure outcome in children with epilepsy and behavioral disorders (self-injurious, aggressive, or destructive behavior) after introduction of risperidone.
In this prospective study, 54 patients were evaluated, 38 boys and 16 girls, aged 2-18 (mean=10). The dose of risperidone ranged from 0.01 to 0.14 mg/kg/day (mean=0.038 mg/kg/day). Risperidone was introduced gradually. The titration rate was determined by clinical response. The data were collected from patients' follow-up visits and clinical files. Exacerbation of seizures was established as an increase in seizure frequency after introduction of risperidone, with return to baseline seizure frequency after risperidone withdrawal.
Seizure frequency was not affected by risperidone in 51 patients (94.5%). Only two (4%) patients experienced seizure exacerbation after the introduction of risperidone. In one patient, the effect of risperidone on seizure control could not be established. After introduction of the risperidone, 38 (70.4%) patients manifested improvement in behavior.
Our data suggest that risperidone can be used in pediatric patients with epilepsy and that seizure outcome is not changed in most children with epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidity. In addition, behavior improvement is usually achieved in most patients.
The in vitro inhibitory effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on myeloma cell growth may be synergistically potentiated by the activity of dexamethasone (DEX) and alpha-interferon (IFN). We treated 10 patients with advanced, refractory multiple myeloma (MM) using a combination of ATRA (100 mg p.o., once a day for two weeks every month), DEX (40 mg i.v., for 4 days every 4 weeks) and IFN (3 MU s.c., three times a week). Eight patients completed at least three months of treatment and were evaluable for response. Two of them showed a partial response which persists after 15 to 17 months. Three patients experienced a stable plateau phase of 4 to +11 months, with a significant improvement in the performance status and bone pain. Progressive disease was seen in the remaining three patients. We conclude that the association of ATRA, DEX and IFN warrants further consideration in MM patients.
A series of 88 conventional follicular and Hürthle cell thyroid tumors were analyzed for RAS mutations and PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangements using molecular methods and for galectin-3 and HBME-1 expression by immunohistochemistry. A novel LightCycler technology-based method was developed to detect point mutations in codons 12/13 and 61 of the H-RAS, K-RAS, and N-RAS genes. Forty-nine percent of conventional follicular carcinomas had RAS mutations, 36% had PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangement, and only one (3%) had both. In follicular adenomas, 48% had RAS mutations, 4% had PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangement, and 48% had neither. Follicular carcinomas with PAX8-PPAR gamma typically showed immunoreactivity for galectin-3 but not for HBME-1, tended to present at a younger patient age and be smaller size, and were almost always overtly invasive. In contrast, follicular carcinomas with RAS mutations most often displayed an HBME-1-positive/galectin-3-negative immunophenotype and were either minimally or overtly invasive. Hürthle cell tumors infrequently had PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangement or RAS mutations. These results suggest that conventional follicular thyroid carcinomas develop through at least two distinct and virtually nonoverlapping molecular pathways initiated by either RAS point mutation or PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangement.
Induction of anaesthesia with ketamine 1.5 mg/kg i.v. in a patient with coronary artery disease caused an increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure from 27 to 65 mmHg, a threefold rise in pulmonary vascular resistance and an increase of the left ventricular filling pressure from 18 to 48 mmHg which was associated with arterial hypoxaemia due to pulmonary edema. Fentanyl (0.01 mg/kg i.v.) promptly reversed the systemic and pulmonary vascular effects of ketamine.
S-phase kinase protein 2 (SKP2), an F-box protein, targets cell cycle regulators including cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 via ubiquitin-mediated degradation. SKP2 is frequently overexpressed in a variety of cancers. We investigated the role of SKP2 and its ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in colorectal carcinoma using a panel of cell lines, clinical samples, and the NUDE mouse model. Using immunohistochemical analysis on a large tissue microarray of 448 samples, an inverse association of SKP2 expression with p27Kip1 protein levels was seen. A colorectal cancer (CRC) subset with high level of SKP2 and low level of p27Kip1 showed a decreased overall survival (P = 0.0057). Treatment of CRC cell lines with bortezomib or expression of small interfering RNA of SKP2 causes down-regulation of SKP2 and accumulation of p27Kip1. Furthermore, treatment of CRC cells with bortezomib causes apoptosis by involving the mitochondrial pathway and activation of caspases. In addition, treatment of CRC cells with bortezomib down-regulated the expression of XIAP, cIAP1, and survivin. Finally, treatment of CRC cell line xenografts with bortezomib resulted in growth inhibition of tumors in NUDE mice via down-regulation of SKP2 and accumulation of p27Kip1. Altogether, our results suggest that SKP2 and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention for treatment of CRC.
Subcutaneous treatment of rats with low doses of lithium and pilocarpine or a high dose of pilocarpine results in a severe seizure--brain damage syndrome. Rats thus treated were studied with multiple-depth electrodes, quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography, and light and electron microscopy. Rats receiving lithium-pilocarpine did not differ from high-dose pilocarpine rats in behavioral, electrographic, metabolic or histopathological findings, but lithium-pilocarpine reproduced the syndrome more reliably and with a lower acute mortality rate. Organized electrographic seizure activity developed just prior to the onset of behavioral forelimb clonus and appeared to originate from ventral forebrain in the vicinity of the ventral pallidum and/or nucleus accumbens. From these sites activity spread rapidly to involve other regions. Once initiated, electrographic seizures persisted for hours. Increased glucose utilization was found in most brain regions during the period of continuous seizure activity. The greatest increases were found in the ventral pallidum, globus pallidus, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, lateral septum, substantia nigra, ventrobasal and mediodorsal thalamus and frontal motor cortex. Animals sustaining seizures displayed a disseminated pattern of neural degeneration not involving globus pallidus or ventral pallidum but otherwise coinciding with the above pattern of enhanced glucose utilization. No consistent correlation was observed between the pattern of brain damage and known regions of high muscarinic cholinergic receptor density. Ultrastructurally, the cytopathological changes, like those associated with various other sustained seizure syndromes, resemble the excitotoxic type of damage glutamate is known to cause. This seizure-brain damage syndrome and that induced by systemic kainic acid appear to be similar in behavioral but not in electrophysiological or metabolic manifestations. During kainic acid seizures, electrographic changes are first recorded in the hippocampus while they are first detected in the ventral forebrain region in pilocarpine seizures. Pilocarpine also induced metabolic activation of ventral forebrain sites not activated by kainic acid. The cytopathology associated with the two syndromes is identical in type but not in pattern, the cholinergic model being characterized by much greater neocortical and slightly less hippocampal damage. Further study of these cholinergic models may provide new insights into the roles of the major excitatory neurotransmitter systems (cholinergic and glutamergic) in limbic epilepsy.
Clorozotocin was evaluated in patients with advanced colorectal cancer at 225 mg/m2 every six weeks in 14 patients with no prior treatment, at 200 mg/m2 in 43 patients with normal tolerance of prior chemotherapy, and at 100 mg/m2 in 38 patients with extensive or poorly tolerated prior therapy. Median survival for the respective groups was 192, 107 and 79 days; these differences are best explained as a function of performance status. Partial response was reported for one patient, 15 had disease stabilization and two had improvement short of partial remission. Myelotoxicity was acceptable at all doses, with thrombocytopenia being dose limiting at 225 mg/m2. Four patients developed azotemia during or after chlorozotocin treatment. Chlorozotocin has minimal activity against colorectal carcinomas and no dose-response relationship is evident.
Repeated stimulation of the amygdaloid complex in rats results in the kindling of epileptic seizures. During the process of kindling and prior to the appearance of full behavioral convulsions, naloxone-sensitive changes in responsiveness to noxious stimulation occur, which disappear with repeated stimulation. When full behavioral convulsions appear, a short period of post-ictal behavioral depression (PID) can be seen immediately following convulsions. Naloxone either attenuates or completely blocks the occurrence of the PID. In order to test further the opioid nature of these phenomena, the development of tolerance to PD with repeated stimulation and the development of cross-tolerance to the analgesic and motor depressant effects of morphine were tested in kindled animals. Repeated elicitation of full behavioral convulsions resulted in a progressive decrease of PID duration across days. PID was also decreased in morphine tolerant animals. Repeated convulsions also induced cross-tolerance with both morphine analgesia and morphine-induced catalepsy. In contrast, animals tested following 10 days of amygdaloid stimulation which did not cause full behavioral convulsions to develop, showed cross-tolerance to the analgesic but not the motor depressant effect of morphine. The possibility that two different opioid systems, which are independent of one another are activated during different phases of kindling is discussed.
Groups of ten male rats were treated with a high challenge dose of cephaloridine (CPH, 3750 mg kg-1), with methylprednisolone (MP, 100 mg kg-1) or with cephaloridine and methylprednisolone (CPH + MP) by single subcutaneous injection. A control group received the injection vehicles only. Urine was collected from all animals daily over 18-h collection periods, up to 96 h after treatment. Blood was collected at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after treatment. At necropsy, kidneys were weighed, processed and examined histopathologically. Results show that methylprednisolone significantly ameliorated the nephrotoxicity of the challenge dose of cephaloridine. CPH-only treated rats had severe toxic nephrosis characterised by acute tubular necrosis, and elevated blood urea and creatinine. By contrast, the majority of CPH + MP treated rats had only a slight or moderate toxic nephrosis, and had lower blood urea and creatinine levels compared with rats treated with CPH only, indicating preservation of kidney function. Interestingly, rats treated with CPH + MP had higher urinary enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma glutamyltransferase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase) as well as protein and glucose, compared with rats treated with CPH only. This is taken to indicate that rats treated with CPH only had such marked kidney damage and necrosis that the population of cells able to produce these marker enzymes was significantly and rapidly depleted, but the protection afforded by methylprednisolone allowed CPH + MP treated rats to sustain urinary enzyme output. Effects on urinary glucose and other parameters such as body weight and kidney weight demonstrate interactions between glucocorticoid pharmacology and cephaloridine nephrotoxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Corticotroph pituitary carcinomas are tumors, defined by the presence of distant metastases that determine their poor prognosis. The diagnosis and therapy of malignant corticotroph adenomas remains a clinical challenge. The molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation of pituitary adenomas are unclear, although they are believed to arise in an adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence. We describe two cases of malignant Cushing's disease with metastases in liver and bone, respectively. The primary pituitary tumors were treated by a combination of radiotherapy and transsphenoidal surgery, but recurred several times in both patients. The time interval between the diagnosis of Cushing's disease and the discovery of metastases was 32 and 17 years, respectively. In the first case the patient died within 6 months after diagnosis of metastasis, whereas the second patient is alive at a follow-up of 2 years after the discovery of the metastasis. Furthermore, we reviewed all available cases of corticotroph pituitary carcinomas reported in the literature and analyzed their clinical features and therapeutical management. In conclusion, frequent relapses of Cushing's disease, aggressive growth of macroadenoma, Nelson's syndrome after adrenalectomy or persistently high ACTH levels should prompt the clinician to consider the possibility of pituitary corticotroph carcinomas.
Flu-like symptoms are common, early transient side effects of paclitaxel chemotherapy. We hypothesized that these symptoms may be due to release of inflammatory cytokines in response to treatment. The objective of this study was to assess changes in plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha during chemotherapy and to correlate these changes with musculoskeletal symptoms.
Ninety patients with breast cancer were included; 70 patients received single agent paclitaxel either weekly or every 3 weeks and 20 received FAC (5-FU, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy. Fifteen healthy volunteers were included as controls. Cytokines and symptoms were measured before starting therapy, on day 3 and on the last day of one treatment cycle.
At baseline, all subjects had measurable levels of IL-8 but only 49% had IL-12, 45% had IL-10, 32% had IL-6, and 21% had IL-1beta or TNF-alpha in their plasma. There was no difference in baseline cytokine levels between cancer patients and the healthy volunteers. Schedule-dependent transient changes in the levels of 3 cytokines were observed in the paclitaxel treated patients. In the every 3-week paclitaxel group, IL-6 and IL-8 increased whereas in the weekly paclitaxel group IL-10 increased significantly compared to baseline. Fatigue and flu-like symptoms were also worse on day 3. In the weekly paclitaxel group, increase in IL-10 level correlated positively with joint pain (p=0.003). In the every 3-week paclitaxel group, increase in IL-8 level correlated positively with flu-like symptom (p=0.008). In the FAC-treated group and among the healthy volunteers none of these cytokines increased significantly.
Weekly paclitaxel induces transient increase in IL-10 levels whereas every 3-week higher dose treatments induce IL-8 and IL-6 in the plasma. These changes correlate with joint pain and flu-like symptoms.
To investigate the safety and efficacy of oral methylprednisolone combined with azathioprine sodium or mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of bullous pemphigoid.
A prospective, multicenter, randomized, nonblinded clinical trial to compare 2 parallel groups of patients with bullous pemphigoid undergoing different treatments.
Thirteen departments of dermatology in Germany.
Patients with bullous pemphigoid (n = 73) as evidenced by clinical lesions suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, signs of subepidermal blistering on histologic analysis of skin biopsy specimens, linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the dermoepidermal junction, and deposition of autoantibodies at the blister roof in split-skin analysis.
Treatment with oral methylprednisolone plus azathioprine (azathioprine group) or oral methylprednisolone plus mycophenolate mofetil (mycophenolate mofetil group).
The cumulative total methylprednisolone doses and rates of remission. Secondary outcome measures were safety profiles and duration of remission.
In 38 of 38 patients in the azathioprine group (100%), complete remission was achieved after a mean +/- SD of 23.8 +/- 18.9 days vs 42.0 +/- 55.3 days for 35 of 35 patients in the mycophenolate mofetil group (100%). In the azathioprine group, the median +/- SD total cumulative methylprednisolone dose used was 4967.0 +/- 12 190.7 mg vs 5754.0 +/- 9692.8 mg in the mycophenolate mofetil group. Nine of 38 patients in the azathioprine group (24%) experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse effects vs 6 of 35 patients in the mycophenolate mofetil group (17%). Azathioprine therapy induced significantly elevated liver function test results compared with mycophenolate mofetil (P < .001). Importantly, patients in the azathioprine group showed significantly higher toxicity grades for aspartate aminotransferase (P = .03), alanine aminotransferase (P = .03), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (P = .01) than did those in the mycophenolate mofetil group.
Mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine demonstrate similar efficacy during treatment of bullous pemphigoid, and similar cumulative corticosteroid doses were given in both treatment arms to control disease. However, mycophenolate mofetil showed a significantly lower liver toxicity profile than azathioprine therapy.
A 69-year-old man was hospitalized for exacerbation of chronic obstructive lung disease. Treatment with nebulized ipratropium bromide resulted in urinary retention that resolved once the drug was discontinued. Urinary retention is a rare complication of ipratropium bromide. Because all of the cases described in the literature occur in elderly men with prostate hypertrophy, the drug should be used cautiously in this group of patients.
Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) activates OFF antinociceptive neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). We examined in rats the effect of intra-ventrolateral (VL)-PAG injections of TRPV1 agonists and antagonists on the nocifensive response to heat in the plantar test, neurotransmitter (glutamate and GABA) release in the RVM, and spontaneous and tail flick-related activities of RVM neurons. The localization of TRPV1 in VL-PAG and RVM neurons was examined using various markers of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Intra-VL-PAG injection of capsaicin increased the threshold of thermal pain sensitivity, whereas the selective TRPV1 antagonist 5'-iodo-resiniferatoxin (I-RTX) facilitated nociceptive responses, and blocked capsaicin analgesic effect at a dose inactive per se. Intra-VL PAG capsaicin evoked a robust release of glutamate in RVM microdialysates. I-RTX, at a dose inactive per se, blocked the effect of capsaicin, and inhibited glutamate release at a higher dose. Antinociception and hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin and I-RTX, respectively, correlated with enhanced or reduced activity of RVM OFF cells. Immunohistochemical analyses suggested that several TRPV1-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in both the VL-PAG and RVM are glutamatergic and surrounded by glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals. Our data suggest that VL-PAG neurons respond to TRPV1 stimulation by releasing glutamate into the RVM, thereby activating OFF cells and producing analgesia. The results obtained with the TRPV1 antagonist alone suggest that this pathway is tonically activated by endovanilloids.
Abnormal diastolic function is common in hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Early identification and treatment may prevent future cardiovascular events.
We examined 58 hypertensive patients with LVH, 38 with hypertension but no LVH, and 38 normotensive subjects. The effects of the AT1 receptor blocker irbesartan and the beta1 blocker atenolol on diastolic function during 48 weeks of treatment were evaluated in the LVH group by tissue velocity echocardiography (TVE). We measured basal septal and lateral wall velocities of early (Em) and late (Am) diastolic myocardial wall motion, Em velocity deceleration time (E-decm), and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRTm). For comparison, diastolic function was assessed by conventional mitral pulse wave Doppler echocardiography.
Diastolic function was impaired in both hypertensive groups. Irbesartan and atenolol (week 48, septal wall) improved IVRTm (-44%, P<.001, and -19%, P<.001; P<or=.001 between groups), E-decm (+56%, P<.001, and +53%, P<.001), and Em/Am (+11%, P=.396, and +20%, P=.010). Only irbesartan improved E/Em (-4%, P=.052 v +2%, P=.041). For irbesartan, relative changes in IVRTm and in septum thickness were related (P=.017), whereas relative changes in the Em/Am ratio and in heart rate were related for atenolol (P=.027). Alterations in diastolic dysfunction were greater and detected earlier with TVE than with conventional echocardiography.
The TVE is more sensitive than conventional echocardiography in detecting alterations in diastolic function. Both irbesartan and atenolol improve diastolic function, but through different mechanisms. The improvement in IVRTm was greater with irbesartan, and only irbesartan improved E/Em. This may have implications on the treatment of high risk hypertensive patients.
This study reports the effect of unilateral vagotomy on neurogenic inflammation in the trachea. Neurogenic inflammation was produced in the trachea of vagotomized rats by a venous injection of capsaicin, the pungent ingredient of red pepper. Monastral blue was used as tracer dye to label the affected blood vessels. Vagus nerves and tracheal tissues were processed for light and electron microscopy. The damaged right vagus nerve was found to have degenerated. However, unilateral vagotomy did not completely block neurogenic inflammation in the trachea ipsilaterally and contralaterally, as shown in the whole mount preparations. Microscopic observations of tracheal tissue sections showed that neurogenic inflammation did not evenly occur on both sides of the trachea. The possible reason for this is discussed.
