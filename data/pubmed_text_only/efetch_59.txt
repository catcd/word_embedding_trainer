Substantial epidemiological studies demonstrate associations between exposure to ambient ozone and mortality. A few studies simply examine the modification of this ozone effect by individual characteristics and socioeconomic status, but socioeconomic status was usually coded at the city level.
This study used a case-crossover design to examine whether impacts of ozone on mortality were modified by socioeconomic status coded at the tract or characteristics at an individual level in eastern Massachusetts, US for a period May-September, 1995-2002, with a total of 157,197 non-accident deaths aging 35 years or older. We used moving averages of maximal 8-hour concentrations of ozone monitored at 8 stationary stations as personal exposure.
A 10 ppb increase in the four-day moving average of maximal 8-hour ozone was associated with 1.68% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51%, 2.87%), 1.96% (95% CI: -1.83%, 5.90%), 8.28% (95% CI: 0.66%, 16.48%), 0.44% (95% CI: -1.45%, 2.37%), -0.83% (95% CI: -2.94%, 1.32%), -1.09% (95% CI: -4.27%, 2.19%) and 6.5% (95% CI: 1.74%, 11.49%) changes in all natural deaths, respiratory disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, heart diseases, acute myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. We did not find any evidence that the associations were significantly modified by socioeconomic status or individual characteristics although small differences of estimates across subpopulations were demonstrated.
Exposure to ozone was associated with specific cause mortality in Eastern Massachusetts during May-September, 1995-2002. There was no evidence that effects of ozone on mortality were significantly modified by socioeconomic status and individual characteristics.
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an induced model of Multiple Sclerosis presents spinal cord demyelination, axonal pathology and neuronal dysfunction. Previous work has shown that progesterone attenuated the clinical severity, demyelination and neuronal dysfunction of EAE mice (Garay et al., J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol., 2008). Here we studied if progesterone also prevented axonal damage, a main cause of neurological disability. To this end, some axonal parameters were compared in EAE mice pretreated with progesterone a week before immunization with MOG(40-54) and in a group of steroid-free EAE mice. On day 16th after EAE induction, we determined in both groups and in control mice: a) axonal density in semithin sections of the spinal cord ventral funiculus; b) appearance of amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunopositive spheroids as an index of damaged axons; c) levels of the growth associated protein GAP43 mRNA and immunopositive cell bodies, as an index of aberrant axonal sprouting. Steroid-naive EAE mice showed decreased axonal density, shrunken axons, abundance of irregular vesicular structures, degenerating APP+ axons, increased expression of GAP43 mRNA and immunoreactive protein in motoneurons. Instead, EAE mice receiving progesterone treatment showed increased axonal counts, high proportion of small diameter axons, reduced APP+ profiles, and decreased GAP43 expression. In conclusion, progesterone enhanced axonal density, decreased axonal damage and prevented GAP43 hyperexpression in the spinal cord of EAE mice. Thus, progesterone also exerts protective effects on the axonal pathology developing in EAE mice.
The effect of halothane on myocardial infarction caused by ligation of the left descending coronary artery was studied in rats. The extent of infarction was quantified 48 hours after ligation of the artery by planimetric measurement of left ventricular slices stained with nitrobluetetrazolium. Animals exposed to halothane one per cent for three hours after the coronary ligation were compared with a control group which received halothane for only 5-7 minutes during surgery. It was found that halothane caused a small increase in infarction size (31.3 +/- 1.5 per cent of the left ventricle compared to 25.7 +/- 2.3 per cent, p less than 0.05). This effect was accompanied by a decrease in systolic blood pressure (91 +/- 2 mmHg compared to 113 +/- 3 mmHg, p less than 0.001). Heart rate did not change significantly. Analysis of our results in comparison to previously reported data on the effect of halothane on myocardial ischaemia in different experimental conditions shows that halothane may produce beneficial as well as detrimental effect on ischaemic injury to the myocardium. The latter can result when the drug causes marked hypotension in the absence of a significant decrease in heart rate.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is implicated in the development of a number of human malignancies including several subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) [G. Pallesen, S.J. Hamilton-Dutoit, X. Zhou, The association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with T cell lymphoproliferations and Hodgkin's disease: two new developments in the EBV Field, Adv. Cancer Res. 62 (1993) 179-239]. Lymphoproliferative disease and NHL occurring in severely immunosuppressed individuals almost always involve EBV and have been extensively studied and modeled in vitro. EBV has also been causally associated with some cases of NHL occurring in otherwise immunocompetent individuals. However, a direct role for EBV in the pathogenesis of neoplasms developing in the presence of an otherwise competent immune system has not been established. We investigated potential interactions between dithiocarbamates (DTC), an important class of thiono-sulfur compounds, and EBV leading to immortalization of human B lymphocytes and evasion of cell-mediated immune response in culture. Primary lymphocyte cultures employing wild-type and recombinant EBV mutants were used to assess the respective roles of DTC and viral genes in lymphocyte transformation and survival. Pretreatment of EBV-infected human B lymphocytes with DTC directly enhanced transformation in the absence of T cells (5 nM) and independently increased survival of transformed cells in the presence of competent autologous T cells (10 nM). Both DTC-induced transformation and immortalization of EBV-infected B lymphocytes were dependent on the expression of viral IL-10. These results provide a biological basis for studying collaborations between chemical and virus that alter lymphocyte biology, and provide a rationale for further molecular epidemiology studies to better understand the potential influence of these interactions on the development of NHL and perhaps other viral-associated malignancies.
Interactions between inhibitors of the proteasome and histone deacetylases have been examined in human T-leukemia/lymphoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Co-exposure of cells to bortezomib and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) synergistically induces T-leukemia/lymphoma cells to undergo apoptosis, consistent with a significant increase in mitochondrial injury and caspase activation. These events are accompanied by inhibition of cyto-protective signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, Raf-1/mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and AKT pathways, and activation of stress-related cascades, including the stress-activated kinases c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). Moreover, bortezomib in conjunction with SAHA efficiently induces apoptosis of primary T-leukemia/lymphoma cells and inhibits tumor growth in a murine xenograft model established with subcutaneous injection of Jurkat cells. Taken together, these findings confirm the synergistic anti-tumor effect of the proteasome and histone deacetylase inhibitors, and provide an insight into the future clinical applications of bortezomib-SAHA combining regimen in treating T-cell malignancies.
Gabapentin has been shown to reduce elements of central sensitization in human experimental hyperalgesia. It remains uninvestigated whether gabapentin has beneficial effects for irritable bowel syndrome associated with visceral hypersensitivity.
To evaluate the effects of gabapentin on sensory and motor function of the rectum in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
Forty patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome completed this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-grouped study. All patients received a barostat study and were subsequently randomized for 5-day treatment with gabapentin 300 mg/day and then 600 mg/day or placebo. On day 6, after subjects had their morning dose, the barostat experiment was repeated.
The threshold pressures for bloating, discomfort and pain significantly increased after gabapentin, but not after placebo. Significant increase in the pressure and corresponding wall tension inducing discomfort or pain were observed in the gabapentin group, but not in the placebo group. Rectal compliance significantly increased after gabapentin, but not after placebo. The postprandial increase of rectal tone was not affected by gabapentin.
Our results show that gabapentin reduces rectal sensory thresholds through attenuating rectal sensitivity to distension and enhancing rectal compliance in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients. The clinical efficacy of this drug in irritable bowel syndrome patients warrants investigation.
Major depressive disorder is often associated with elevated glucocorticoid levels, which in turn suppress cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Increasing evidence supports that antidepressants induce hippocampal neurogenesis and this induces speculation that decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis has causal relationship with depression. There is, however, a lack of information about neurogenic effects of antidepressants on the subventricular zone, which is another CNS region with continuous neurogenesis throughout adulthood. In the present study, we investigated whether corticosterone and the SSRI paroxetine, have effects on SVZ cell proliferation.
Rats were treated with the corresponding drugs for 14 days and the proliferating cells were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). BrdU labeled cells in the SVZ were quantified and analyzed.
In the corticosterone-treatment group, cell proliferation was decreased by 18% compared to vehicle-treatment group. Paroxetine-treatment group, in contrast, shows a 34% increase in cell proliferation. The decreased cell proliferation caused by corticosterone was prevented by paroxetine.
Although corticosterone and antidepressants were found to affect cell proliferation in hippocampus, this is the first report to demonstrate that 1) corticosterone decreases cell proliferation in SVZ; 2) paroxetine promotes SVZ cell proliferation and 3) the suppressive effect on SVZ cell proliferation by corticosterone could be attenuated by paroxetine. These findings provide new insights into basic mechanisms of antidepressants, potential impact of steroid therapy on CNS neurogenesis, antidepressant mechanisms of action and potential involvement of the olfactory system in depression.
Thiopentone doses corresponding to 5.238 mg x kg-1, that is 2UD95 (UD95:unconsciousness dose 95) inhibit the intensity of succinylcholine-induced fasciculations compared with UD95. Alfathesin doses corresponding to 0.570 mg x kg-1, also 2UD95 (calculated as alphaxalone at a concentration of 9 mg/ml in alfathesin), do not have any greater effect on the degree of fasciculations compared to UD95. Furthermore, neither induction agent influences the incidence, distribution and duration of succinylcholine-induced myalgias. The inhibition of the degree of fasciculations caused by thiopentone is believed to be a consequence of a postsynaptic depressant effect of thiopentone at the neuromuscular junction. The evaluation of the degree of succinylcholine-induced fasciculations must take into consideration the dose of thiopentone administered at induction of anaesthesia.
Recent randomized clinical trials have shown that total mortality and cardiovascular mortality are reduced by the early intravenous administration of beta-blockers to patients suspected of suffering from acute myocardial infarction. These trials were conducted on patients meeting strict entry criteria. In order to assess this therapy when applied to a broader range of myocardial infarction patients, we performed a Phase IV study of metoprolol in acute myocardial infarction. The study was designed to test whether early (less than 8 hours from onset of chest pain) intervention by practicing physicians with open label intravenous metoprolol for cases of suspected acute myocardial infarction achieved mortality results similar to those obtained in large randomized clinical trials. We studied 3824 patients treated by 741 physicians representing a broad spectrum of clinical practice in the United States. Seventy-two percent of the patients entered into the study had confirmed myocardial infarction (39% anterior, 39% inferior, 22% other locations) and 85% of all individuals treated tolerated the full intravenous dose of 15 mg of metoprolol. The 15 day total mortality and cardiovascular mortality rates were 4.9% and 4.5%; 90 day mortality rates were 6.9 and 5.9%. Patients with anterior infarctions had a significantly greater cumulative mortality rate than patients with other types of infarctions. Marked bradycardia (heart rate less than 45 beats per minute) in the first 8 hours post treatment occurred in 4.7% cases and hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) occurred in 9.8% of cases. When compared with the results of the Göteborg and MIAMI trials of metoprolol, it appears that there is no appreciable increase in mortality or morbidity when metoprolol is used in the community practice of acute coronary care.
The pulmonary adenoma susceptibility 1 (Pas1) locus affects inherited predisposition and resistance to chemically induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. The A/J and C57BL/6J mouse strains carry the susceptibility and resistance allele, respectively. We identified and genotyped 65 polymorphisms in the Pas1 locus region in 29 mouse inbred strains, and delimited the Pas1 locus to a minimal region of 468 kb containing six genes. That region defined a core Pas1 haplotype with 42 tightly linked markers, including intragenic polymorphisms in five genes (Bcat1, Lrmp, Las1, Ghiso, and Kras2) and amino-acid changes in three genes (Lrmp, Las1, Lmna-rs1). In (A/J x C57BL/6J)F1 mouse lung tumors, the Lmna-rs1 gene was completely downregulated, whereas allele-specific downregulation of the C57BL/6J-derived allele was observed at the Las1 gene, suggesting the potential role of these genes in tumor suppression. These results indicate a complex multigenic nature of the Pas1 locus, and point to a functional role for both intronic and exonic polymorphisms of the six genes of the Pas1 haplotype in lung tumor susceptibility.
The mammalian silent information regulator-two 1 (Sirt1) blunts the noxious effects of cardiovascular risk factors such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Nevertheless, the role of Sirt1 in regulating the expression of tissue factor (TF), the key trigger of coagulation, and arterial thrombus formation remains unknown.
Human as well as mouse cell lines were used for in vitro experiments, and C57Bl/6 mice for in vivo procedures. Sirt1 inhibition by splitomicin or sirtinol enhanced cytokine-induced endothelial TF protein expression as well as surface activity, while TF pathway inhibitor protein expression did not change. Sirt1 inhibition further enhanced TF mRNA expression, TF promoter activity, and nuclear translocation as well as DNA binding of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB/p65). Sirt1 siRNA enhanced TF protein and mRNA expression, and this effect was reduced in NFκB/p65(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts reconstituted with non-acetylatable Lys(310)-mutant NFκB/p65. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and p44/42 (ERK) remained unaffected. In vivo, mice treated with the Sirt1 inhibitor splitomicin exhibited enhanced TF activity in the arterial vessel wall and accelerated carotid artery thrombus formation in a photochemical injury model.
We provide pharmacological and genetic evidence that Sirt1 inhibition enhances TF expression and activity by increasing NFκB/p65 activation in human endothelial cells. Furthermore, Sirt1 inhibition induces arterial thrombus formation in vivo. Hence, modulation of Sirt1 may offer novel therapeutic options for targeting thrombosis.
Fluconazole has been associated with various teratisms in animals, including craniofacial ossification defects, thin, wavy ribs, and renal pelvis defects. We describe three infants born to women who were receiving fluconazole through or beyond the first trimester of pregnancy. All of the infants had congenital anomalies; no other drug was implicated. Only one of the three infants survived. Their anomalies, similar to those observed in animal studies, were largely craniofacial, skeletal (i.e., thin, wavy ribs and ossification defects), and cardiac. One of these infants was previously reported as having Antley-Bixler syndrome; however, given the chronology described herein and the similarity of this infant to the others, we conclude that her deformities also represent the potent teratogenic effect of fluconazole.
The authors reports an unrecognised secondary effect, but perhaps not as rare as has been thought, of enalapril: the acute abdomen. Three similar cases have previously been reported. The underlying mechanism is probably the inhibition of degradation of tissue kinins to inactive peptides as in subcutaneous and/or submucous angioneurotic oedema. Todate, this secondary effect has not been reported with other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The relationship between the acute abdomen and angioneurotic oedema with primary hyperaldosteronism is discussed.
To investigate whether the newly described G1502 to A1502 mutation in exon 3 of the LH beta-subunit gene, causing the amino acid substitution of Ser102 for Gly102, is related to female infertility.
Screening of fertile and infertile women for the G1502 to A1502 mutation in the LH beta-subunit gene.
Clinics and laboratories of the National University Hospital obstetrics and gynecology department, Singapore.
Two hundred twelve healthy fertile women; 40 infertile women with menstrual disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome, and endometriosis; and 12 women with idiopathic infertility.
Exon 3 of the LH beta-subunit gene was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and PCR-mediated direct DNA sequencing.
The PCR products of patients were analyzed by RFLP, and the results were compared with those of fertile controls. DNA sequencing radiographs were compared between two mutation-bearing patients and four controls.
The mutation was identified in only two infertile women with endometriosis; other women studied were found to be negative for this mutation.
The missense mutation in the LH beta-subunit gene may be implicated in female infertility, possibly endometriosis-associated infertility in some women.
In six vervet monkeys, presynaptic striatal dopamine function was assessed longitudinally by [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA)-positron emission tomography (PET) after administration (2 x 2 mg/kg, i.m., 4 h apart) of either amphetamine (Amp), n = 3, or methamphetamine (MeAmp), n = 3. At 1-2 weeks postdrug, both Amp and MeAmp exposure effected similar decreases (60-70%) in the FDOPA influx rate constant (FDOPA Ki), an index of striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. Subsequent studies in these subjects showed that FDOPA Ki values were decreased by 45-67% at 3-6 weeks, by 25% at 10-12 weeks and by 16% in one Amp-treated subject at 32 weeks. Biochemical analysis showed that striatal dopamine concentrations were decreased by 75% at 3-4 weeks and by 55% at 10-12 weeks. These results indicate that in vervet monkey striatum, an acute Amp or MeAmp drug dosage produces extensive striatal dopamine system neurotoxicity. However, these effects were reversible; observed time-dependent recovery in both FDOPA Ki and dopamine concentrations indicates that neurochemical plasticity remains active in the adult primate striatum. At 3-4 and 10-12 weeks postdrug, the concurrent characterization of the striatal FDOPA Ki and dopamine concentrations for individual subjects showed that Ki decreases between 24 and 67% corresponded to dopamine depletions of 55-85%. These relatively larger postdrug decrements in steady-state striatal dopamine concentrations suggest that compensatory increases in dopamine synthesis capacity develop in the partially lesioned striatum. In contrast to the dopamine depletion in striatum, substantia nigra concentrations remained unchanged from referent values at both 3-4 and 10-12 weeks postdrug. Thus, the integrity of the substantia nigra could not be inferred from decreases in the striatal FDOPA Ki parameter. This disparity between striatum and substantia nigra reactivity to systemic administration of amphetamines suggests that each has unique dopamine system regulatory mechanisms.
Drug induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death, and has emerged as a worldwide problem. Most drugs that cause this are thought to directly block a specific cardiac ion channel (KCNH2 or hERG) that carries the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current, I(Kr). In this issue of the British Journal of Pharmacology, evidence is presented to support a new mechanism for causing drug induced LQTS. The drug pentamidine, at near therapeutic concentrations that do not cause direct KCNH2 channel block, disrupts normal KCNH2 channel protein processing and maturation to reduce its surface membrane expression. This indirect mechanism for reducing I(Kr) is novel, and whether other drugs may cause similar protein trafficking abnormalities is largely unknown.
Effects of CGP36742 (3-aminopropyl-n-butylphosphinic acid), an orally active GABA(B) receptor antagonist, on the baclofen- and scopolamine-induced deficit of place learning in the Morris water maze task were examined in rats. Rats were given four training trials per day with the submerged platform at a fixed location in the maze for 4 days. On day 4, the rats were required to swim in the pool without the platform after the fourth training trial (probe test). Intraperitoneal injection of baclofen (4 mg/kg) or scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg) significantly increased the escape latency to reach the platform and decreased the duration in the quadrant where the platform had been originally located. Increased latency in the training trials and decreased duration in the probe test induced by baclofen or scopolamine were significantly attenuated by oral administration of CGP36742 at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg. In the rotarod test, CGP36742 at a dose of 100 mg/kg but not at doses of 10 or 30 mg/kg antagonized the baclofen-induced motor incoordination. Thus, there was dissociation between the effective doses of CGP36742 in the learning task and those in the sensory motor test. These results suggest the possible involvement of cholinergic systems as well as GABA(B) receptor systems in the CGP36742 action.
Recently, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) was reported to induce clinical remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Modulation of protein phosphorylation by binding to the vicinal thiols has been suggested as a possible mechanism. We found that phenylarsine oxide, a strong vicinal thiol-binding agent, neither induced nuclear fragmentation or DNA laddering nor increased caspase activity in NB4 cells; however, As2O3 and a weak thiol-binding agent, dimethylarsinic acid, did increase activity. Dithiothreitol (DTT) effectively suppressed the phenylarsine oxide-inhibited cellular reductive capacity, but unexpectedly, enhanced As2O3-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells. As2O3-induced and As2O3-plus-DTT-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells was modulated by oxidant modifiers, but not by nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. These results demonstrate that DTT, a dithiol agent and known antidote for trivalent inorganic arsenic, enhances the toxicity of As2O3, thereby opening a new research direction for the mechanisms of arsenic toxicity and perhaps also helping in the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating leukemias.
Mutational activation of BRAF is the earliest and most common genetic alteration in human melanoma. To build a model of human melanoma, we generated mice with conditional melanocyte-specific expression of BRaf(V600E). Upon induction of BRaf(V600E) expression, mice developed benign melanocytic hyperplasias that failed to progress to melanoma over 15-20 months. By contrast, expression of BRaf(V600E) combined with Pten tumor suppressor gene silencing elicited development of melanoma with 100% penetrance, short latency and with metastases observed in lymph nodes and lungs. Melanoma was prevented by inhibitors of mTorc1 (rapamycin) or MEK1/2 (PD325901) but, upon cessation of drug administration, mice developed melanoma, indicating the presence of long-lived melanoma-initiating cells in this system. Notably, combined treatment with rapamycin and PD325901 led to shrinkage of established melanomas. These mice, engineered with a common genetic profile to human melanoma, provide a system to study melanoma's cardinal feature of metastasis and for preclinical evaluation of agents designed to prevent or treat metastatic disease.
DNA microarray technology was developed as a tool for simultaneously measuring a number of gene expression changes, and has been applied for investigations of toxicity assessments of chemicals. In this study, we used a typical hepatotoxicant, thioacetamide (TA), to find correlations between the extent of hepatotoxicity and certain gene expression patterns or specific gene expression profiles. TA was intraperitoneally administered at high (400 mg/kg), medium (150 mg/kg) or low (50 mg/kg) dose (four rats per group) and then the serum and liver were collected at the indicated time (6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h). Serum biochemical markers were measured and hepatic mRNA expression profiles were analyzed by a DNA microarray. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were increased by TA-administration in a dose-dependent manner and reached the maximum at 24h. Hierarchical clustering analysis of all dosage groups revealed in 2 major clusters, distinguished by an early (6 and 12h) and a late (24, 36 and 48 h) phase. The early and late phase clusters were sorted in time- and dose-dependent manners. The major gene expression profile obtained by quality-threshold (QT) clustering analysis showed the same maximal toxic time as that estimated by the serum biochemical markers. The individual expression profiles of the candidate genes selected in our previous studies and the simultaneous gene expression patterns measured by five typical hepatotoxicants including TA also reflected the hepatotoxicity of TA. These findings suggest that the potential toxic effects appearing as gene expression changes are independent of the dosage of TA. This study suggested that the major gene expression profile estimated by QT clustering would be a sensitive marker of hepatotoxicity.
Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical estrogen widely used in the food-packaging industry and baby bottles, is recovered in human fluids (0.1-10 nM). Recent studies have reported that BPA is hormonally active at low doses, emphasizing the debate of a risk for human health. Estrogen receptors are expressed in the colon, and although the major route of BPA exposure is food, the effects on gut have received no attention. We first examined the endocrine disrupting potency of BPA on colonic paracellular permeability (CPP), experimental colitis, and visceral sensitivity in ovariectomized rats orally exposed to 5 mg/kg/d BPA (i.e., the no observed adverse effect level), 50 microg/kg/d BPA (i.e., tolerable daily intake), or lower doses. BPA dose-dependently decreased basal CPP, with a half-maximal inhibitory dose of 5.2 microg/kg/d, 10-fold below the tolerable daily intake. This correlated with an increase in epithelial tight junction sealing, also observed in Caco-2 cells exposed to 10 nM BPA. When ovariectomized rats were fed with BPA at the no observed adverse effect level, the severity of colitis was reduced, whereas the same dose increased pain sensitivity to colorectal stimuli. We then examined the impact of perinatal exposure to BPA on intestinal permeability and inflammatory response in the offspring. In female rats, but not in male rats, perinatal BPA evoked a decrease of CPP in adulthood, whereas the proinflammatory response of colonic mucosa was strengthened. This study first demonstrates that the xenoestrogen BPA at reference doses influences intestinal barrier function and gut nociception. Moreover, perinatal exposure promotes the development of severe inflammation in adult female offspring only.
Neurophysiologic studies indicate that local anesthetic-induced seizures are generated in subcortical brain structures. The authors utilized a quantitative autoradiographic technique to measure cerebral metabolism during lidocaine-induced seizure activity in rats anesthetized with nitrous oxide. Local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (l-CMRg) was determined when lidocaine infusion resulted in sustained electroencephalographic patterns consisting of approximately 100--125-mu volt discharges with a frequency of about 9 Hz, lasting 1-2 sec, and superimposed upon almost isoelectric periods lasting 1-3 sec. Significant reductions in 1-CMRg (30-70 per cent decreases) occurred in 19 of 26 regions surveyed. All areas of cerebral cortex had decreased glucose uptake following lidocaine administration. The hippocampus developed a striking increase in 1-CMRg of 237 per cent, while the amygdala and other related nuclei sustained metabolic rates similar to those present before lidocaine was given. This study demonstrates a coupling of metabolic activity with functional activity in subcortical structures recognized to be involved in the generation of local anesthetic seizure activity. Additionally, it reveals a heterogeneous response of cerebral metabolism to lidocaine infusion in the presence of subcortically localized seizures.
A three-year-old girl who underwent an operation for adrenal neuroblastoma was anaesthetized with sevoflurane and epidural analgesia. In the immediate recovery period she had convulsions. The convulsions were successfully treated with thiopentone and sevoflurane, there were no neurological sequelae. The convulsions were considered to be a manifestation of mepivacaine toxicity because of a high plasma mepivacaine concentration. Complications of paediatric regional analgesia and manifestations of mepivacaine toxicity under sevoflurane anaesthesia are discussed.
Administration of a single oral 2.5 mg dose of bromocriptine (Brc), a dopamine (DA) receptor agonist, to normal male volunteers results in comparable marked decreases in resting supine plasma concentrations of DA (decrement 2 h after drug administration was 67 +/- 5%; mean +/- SE), norepinephrine (NE; 63 +/- 3%) and epinephrine (E; 65 +/- 5%); decreases in all three plasma catecholamine (CA) concentrations were significant at p less than 0.001. This effect of Brc on plasma CAs was initiated more rapidly and was of briefer duration than the suppressive effect on serum prolactin (Prl). When Brc was administered daily for 1 week, its effect on plasma CAs had terminated within 4 h of its adninistration. A further oral dose after administration of Brc for 1 week produced identical suppressive effects on plasma CAs to those observed following the 1st dose. Brc did not prevent the incremental response of plasma DA, NE and E to standing. Also, orthostatic hypotension occurred on occasion, in spite of normal plasma CA responses to standing. Brc did not affect basal serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. These data describing a suppressive effect of Brc on plasma DA, NE and E suggest that Brc inhibits release of these CAs from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings and adrenal medulla, and acts at least in part through presynaptic CA receptors in the brain. The suppressive effect of Brc on plasma CAs may prove useful as a test of normal presynaptic CA mechanisms.
Severe zinc (Zn) deficiency inhibits growth, insulin storage and release. Mild or moderate Zn deficiency may also have profound physiological effects that are not outwardly evident. We examined the effects of graded levels of low Zn intake on growth, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and glucose homeostasis in weanling rats.
Weanling rats were fed ad libitum for 3 weeks with diets containing different Zn levels: very low Zn, low Zn or mildly low Zn; there was also a control group and an additional group was pair-fed to very low Zn rats. Growth and food intake were recorded. Serum Zn, IGF-I, IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), serum insulin and glucose, tissue Zn and jejunal sucrase activity were measured. Relative liver IGF-I and IGFBP-3 mRNA levels were quantified.
Serum and tissue Zn were significantly lower in rats fed very low Zn (compared with pair-fed animals and controls) and low Zn (compared with controls). Growth was significantly lower in rats fed very low Zn and pair-fed animals (compared with controls) and in those fed very low Zn (compared with pair-fed animals). Liver IGF-I and IGFBP-3 mRNA levels were higher in low Zn animals compared with controls. Serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were not affected by diet. Serum glucose was significantly higher in rats fed very low Zn than in pair-fed animals (191 +/- 28 vs 99 +/- 5 mg/dL, respectively). Sucrase activity was lower in rats fed very low Zn than in pair-fed animals or controls and a linear relationship was observed between serum glucose and insulin (r = 0.65, P < 0.01) in pair-fed animals and controls but not in Zn-deficient groups.
Severe Zn deficiency was associated with hyperglycemia and relative hypoinsulinemia. Mild degrees of Zn deficiency also altered glucose metabolism, suggesting that Zn intake may be a sensitive regulator of glucose homeostasis.
Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) was evaluated, using continuous-infusion p-aminohippurate clearance (CLPAH) and single-injection plasma clearance of technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3; CLMAG3) methods. Simultaneous clearance determinations were made in 6 dogs: 2 determinations for each dog before, and 1 determination after renal failure was induced by administration of amphotericin B. Linear regression analysis was used to derive an equation to estimate ERPF from CLMAG3 after the single IV injection. A Student's t-test was used to compare pharmacokinetics between the dogs when they were healthy and when they were in renal failure. An F-test was used to determine the appropriate Student's t-test. Results indicated that CLMAG3 correlated reasonably well (r = 0.83, P < 0.0001) with ERPF obtained from the CLPAH value. The volume of distribution and elimination of 99mTc-MAG3 decreased during renal failure. Although there was minimal binding of 99mTc-MAG3 to erythrocytes, it was significantly (P = 0.0008) lower during renal failure. Protein binding was not significantly different during renal failure. All dogs had signs of nausea and emesis at variable times after injection of 99mTc-MAG3. Determination of CLMAG3 after a single injection provides an adequate means to rapidly assess ERPF in dogs. The technique could easily be performed in dogs with renal disease, thus providing valuable information regarding progression of naturally acquired renal failure.
N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity, alpha 1-microglobulin, albumin, and creatinine were determined in urine specimens of healthy children, age 4 months up to 15 years, and of children with type I diabetes and of juvenile patients receiving amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, during severe systemic infections. All resulting values were expressed per g of creatinine. beta-Glucosaminidase activity was determined colorimetrically using 3-cresolsulfonphthaleinyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide as a substrate. Creatinine was determined by a modified Jaffé reaction. alpha 1-microglobulin and albumin were measured by immunodiffusion. In normal urine beta-glucosaminidase activity showed a log-normal distribution with an upper limit 97.5 percentile of 3.61 U/g creatinine. In patients receiving amikacin for up to 3 weeks beta-glucosaminidase and alpha 1-microglobulin significantly rose to very high values (6-10 times) during the course of the treatment. Urinary albumin values was only doubled. All values returned to normal, days or occasionally weeks after discontinuation of the therapy. 3 groups of diabetic children could be distinguished using urinary beta-glucosaminidase as a discriminator a) children with repeatedly normal activities, b) children with intermittently elevated activities and c) children with repeatedly elevated activities. While alpha 1-microglobulin concentrations followed the same pattern, the excretion of albumin did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
