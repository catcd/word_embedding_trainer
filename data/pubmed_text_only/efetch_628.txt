The responses of eicosanoids to acute myocardial ischemia induced by either exercise stress testing (EX) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were investigated in 23 patients with effort angina pectoris (EAP). EX was useful procedure to determine the therapeutic plan in each cases, and PTCA is the novel therapeutic operation for EAP. The relations between these metabolites and either hemodynamics or coronary circulation were then evaluated. The effect of the calcium entry blocker nisoldipine (oral administration of 5 mg) was also studied in 10 patients with EAP. The plasma levels of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6KPGF1 alpha) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) were determined by radioimmunoassay. in arterial and coronary sinus blood samples before and immediately after acute myocardial ischemia. The changes in hemodynamics and coronary circulation during exercise stress testing were assessed by measuring direct brachial artery pressure, cardiac output by the dye dilution method and coronary sinus flow by the thermodilution method. The TXB2/6KPGF1 alpha ratio in coronary sinus blood significantly increased after ischemia in both EX and PTCA, but there was no significant change in LTC4 levels of coronary sinus blood immediately after acute ischemia. The 6KPGF1 alpha levels in both arterial and coronary venous blood were significantly correlated to coronary perfusion pressure and mean brachial artery pressure. Arterial LTC4 levels tended to correlate to mean brachial artery pressure and coronary sinus flow. Nisoldipine improved the ischemic electrocardiography response to EX. Nisoldipine also significantly increased arterial 6KPGF1 alpha at peak exercise. It significantly decreased brachial artery pressure, pressure rate product (PRP), mean coronary sinus pressure and coronary vascular resistance both at rest and peak exercise. The response of PRP significantly correlated with the response of arterial 6KPGF1 alpha. These results suggest: 1 The imbalance of the TXB2/6KPGF1 alpha ratio may be induced more rapidly than LTC4. 2 PGI2 and LTC4 may have some role in the regulation of hemodynamics and coronary circulation during acute myocardial ischemia. 3 Nisoldipine may ameliorate myocardial ischemia through improvement of systemic hemodynamics and prostaglandin metabolism apart from through direct action on the heart.
A band phagocytosis, following Z line and I band loss, is described in polymyositis, in epsilon amino caproic acid induced myopathy and in an experimental myositis of guinea pigs. It is far less prominent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This form of necrosis is always associated with lesions in the plasma membrane. It is argued that the ensuing ionic equilibration with the extracellular fluid allows activation of a calcium activated proteinase (CAP) which digests the Z line. Breakdown of the myofibrils into individual A bands promotes rapid phagocytosis of the myofibre contents and facilitates regeneration of the muscle.
Acute rat experiments have demonstrated that ethanol and acetaldehyde can produce cardionecrotic affect, provided they are maintained at high levels in the blood via inhalation intragastric (for ethanol) or repeated intraperitoneal (for acetaldehyde) administration. Teturam in doses producing blood acetaldehyde rise has similar effect. No alterative effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde could be demonstrated in isolated perfused hearts. The fact that this necrogenic effect is present in in-vivo experiments and absent in the isolated heart suggests that the action of ethanol and acetaldehyde may be mediated.
The noxious 3-carbon electrophile acrolein forms on combustion of diverse organic matter including synthetic polymers such as polyethylene. While known to play a key role in smoke inhalation injury (SII), the molecular basis for the pulmonary toxicity of high dose acrolein-containing smoke is unclear. As a result, drug interventions in SII are poorly directed against pathogenetic smoke toxicants such as acrolein. The first aim of this study was to confirm a role for acrolein in the acute toxicity of smoke extracts towards A549 lung cells by monitoring adduction of known acrolein targets and the expression of acrolein-inducible genes. A second aim was to evaluate carbonyl scavengers for their abilities to protect cell targets and block smoke extract toxicity. Extracts were prepared by bubbling smoke released by smouldering polyethylene through a buffered saline-trap. Acrolein levels in the extracts were estimated via HPLC after derivatisation with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Extracts were highly toxic towards A549 cells, eliciting greater ATP depletion than an equivalent concentration of acrolein alone. The toxicity was accompanied by pronounced carbonylation of several cytoskeletal targets, namely vimentin and keratins-7, -8 and -18. Western blotting revealed that polyethylene combustion products also upregulated several acrolein-responsive protein markers, including GADD45beta, NQO1, HMOX, Hsp70, Nur77 and Egr1. Several carbonyl scavengers (bisulfite, d-penicillamine, hydralazine and 1-hydrazinoisoquinoline) strongly attenuated smoke extract toxicity, with bisulfite suppressing both the adduction and cross-linking of intermediate filament targets. Bisulfite also suppressed the cytotoxicity of smoke extracts when detected using real-time monitoring of cellular impedance. These findings confirm a key role for acrolein in smoke cytotoxicity and suggest drugs that block acrolein toxicity deserve further investigation as possible interventions against SII.
Gentamicin sulfate was administered by intraperitoneal injection to male Sprague-Dawley rats in a dose of 100 to 120 mg/kg/day for 4 to 5 days to induce severe nephrotoxicity. In comparison to controls, inulin clearance was markedly decreased (2.87 +/- 0.31 vs. 8.65 +/- 0.31 ml/min/kg, P less than 0.001) as was urinary osmolality (462 +/- 36 vs. 1196 +/- 46, P less than 0.001). Surface tubules appeared heterogeneous. Some were plugged by whitish debris, whereas others were markedly dilated (I.D. = 41.5 +/- 2 mu). All other tubules were moderately dilated (I.D. = 28.8 vs. 20 mu). The microinfusion of tubules with cellular debris with an isotonic "equilibrium" solution resulted in a rise in intratubular pressure to as high as 60 to 80 mm Hg, compared with 13 to 15 mm Hg in normal rats. In better functioning nephrons, free-flow pressure (FFP) was increased significantly (16.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 10.2 +/- 0.1 mm Hg, P less than 0.001). Paired measurements of single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) in these nephrons, made while monitoring intratubular pressure (ITP), revealed a rise in SNGFR when ITP was lowered from the initially high level to 10 mm Hg. Comparable changes in SNGFR were induced in normal rats by varying ITP from 10 to 15 mm Hg. The data suggest that in severe gentamicin nephrotoxicity, many cortical nephrons may be contributing very little to excretory function, presumably because of intratubular obstruction. The less impaired nephrons have reduced SNGFR, due in part to increased free-flow pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Bepridil hydrochloride (Bpd) has attracted attention as an effective drug for atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL). However, serious adverse effects, including torsade de pointes (Tdp), have been reported.
Adverse effects of Bpd requiring discontinuation of treatment were evaluated. Bpd was administered to 459 patients (361 males, 63+/-12 years old) comprising 378 AF and 81 AFL cases. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction and atrial dimension (LAD) were 66+/-11% and 40+/-6 mm, respectively. Adverse effects were observed in 19 patients (4%) during an average follow-up of 20 months. There was marked QT prolongation greater than 0.55 s in 13 patients, bradycardia less than 40 beats/min in 6 patients, dizziness and general fatigue in 1 patient each. In 4 of 13 patients with QT prolongation, Tdp occurred. The major triggering factors of Tdp were hypokalemia and sudden decrease in heart rate. There were no differences in the clinical backgrounds of the patients with and without Tdp other than LAD and age, which were larger and older in the patients with Tdp.
Careful observation of serum potassium concentration and the ECG should always be done during Bpd administration, particularly in elderly patients.
Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a secondary inflammatory, painful disease of the knee joint with increasing destruction of the articular cartilage. In the inflammatory process the formation of free radicals (reactive oxygen species, ROS) plays a major role in progression of disease and in the subsequent destruction of joint cartilage. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the antioxidative potency of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) nimesulide on glutathione S-transferase (GST), an enzymatic free radical scavenger. In addition, the effects on matrix metalloproteinase MMP-3 and its antagonist tissue inhibitor of matrix-metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP-1) were determined.
This was an open-pilot study on 20 patients (aged 41-71 years old) suffering from painful OA of the knee, treated for 3 weeks with nimesulide 100 mg b.i.d. Twenty-three healthy subjects (aged 23-57 years), not age matched, served as a comparison group. GST, MMP-3 and TIMP-1 were measured by enzyme-immunoassays. Clinical symptoms and joint function were measured using the WOMAC Index.
During the 3-week treatment period with nimesulide 100 mg b.i.d., both scavenger GST and the TIMP-1/MMP-3 ratio significantly increased. This change was accompanied by significant clinical improvement in terms of pain reduction, stiffness and joint function. Two adverse events occurred possibly related to nimesulide treatment: one case of moderate eyelid swelling, and one case of moderate diarrhea with no abnormality in the endoscopic examination.
These results confirm the antioxidative properties of the study drug, indicating that nimesulide, beside its known anti-inflammatory properties, also shows an evident antioxidative activity that adds further supportive evidence to its key role in the treatment of OA patients (thanks to the absence of degenerative effects on cartilage).
Previous studies have demonstrated a lower density of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in subjects without Del alleles of the -141C Ins/Del polymorphism in DRD2 gene promoter region than in those with one or two Del alleles. The present study aimed to examine whether the -141C Ins/Del DRD2 promoter polymorphism is related to therapeutic response to selective DRD2 antagonists in the treatment of schizophrenia. Subjects consisted of 49 acutely exacerbated schizophrenic inpatients treated with bromperidol (30 cases, mean dose +/- SD: 11.4 +/- 4.8 mg/day) or nemonapride (19 cases, 18 mg/day). Clinical symptoms were evaluated by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) before and 3 weeks after the treatment. The -141C Ins/Del DRD2 genotypes, the Ins and Del alleles, were determined by a polymerase chain reaction method. Thirty-five patients were homozygous for the Ins allele and 14 were heterozygous for the Del and Ins alleles. The patients without Del allele showed a higher percentage of improvement in anxiety-depression symptoms than those with Del allele (58.5 +/- 44.5% versus 24.1 +/- 48.2%) after 3 weeks of treatment while percentage improvement in total BPRS or other subgrouped symptoms (positive, negative, excitement and cognitive symptoms) was similar between the two genotype groups. The present results suggest that the -141C Ins/Del DRD2 polymorphism is associated with anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of neuroleptic treatment in schizophrenic patients.
The subiculum was recently shown to be crucially involved in the generation of interictal activity in human temporal lobe epilepsy. Using the pilocarpine model of epilepsy, this study examines the anatomical substrates for network hyperexcitability recorded in the subiculum. Regular- and burst-spiking subicular pyramidal cells were stained with fluorescence dyes and reconstructed to analyze seizure-induced alterations of the dendritic and axonal system. In control animals burst-spiking cells outnumbered regular-spiking cells by about two to one. Regular- and burst-spiking cells were characterized by extensive axonal branching and autapse-like contacts, suggesting a high intrinsic connectivity. In addition, subicular axons projecting to CA1 indicate a CA1-subiculum-CA1 circuit. In the subiculum of pilocarpine-treated rats we found an enhanced network excitability characterized by spontaneous rhythmic activity, polysynaptic responses, and all-or-none evoked bursts of action potentials. In pilocarpine-treated rats the subiculum showed cell loss of about 30%. The ratio of regular- and burst-spiking cells was practically inverse as compared to control preparations. A reduced arborization and spine density in the proximal part of the apical dendrites suggests a partial deafferentiation from CA1. In pilocarpine-treated rats no increased axonal outgrowth of pyramidal cells was observed. Hence, axonal sprouting of subicular pyramidal cells is not mandatory for the development of the pathological events. We suggest that pilocarpine-induced seizures cause an unmasking or strengthening of synaptic contacts within the recurrent subicular network.
The concentration and time dependence of caffeine-induced neurotoxicity was determined by infusing rats intravenously with caffeine at a rate of about 5, 12.5, and 25 mg kg-1 min-1 until the onset of generalized seizures which occurred at about 82, 28, and 11 min, respectively. The concentration of caffeine in the serum, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid at onset of seizures increased with decreasing infusion rate; the concentrations of caffeine metabolites were negligible and serum protein binding was not affected by the infusion rate. In another experiment, one group of rats was infused with caffeine for 60 min at about 2.2 mg kg-1 min-1 whereas another group was infused with solvent only. Both groups were then immediately infused with caffeine at about 22 mg kg-1 min-1 until onset of seizures. Caffeine concentrations at that time in serum, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid were significantly higher in the caffeine-pretreated animals than in the solvent-pretreated controls. The same pretreatment 17 hr before the fast infusion of caffeine had no apparent effect on caffeine concentrations at onset of seizures. These results show that functional tolerance to the seizure-inducing effect of caffeine in rats develops within minutes and that it is reversible within hours or less.
To report a case of an uncommon and up to date unpublished peracute and overwhelming muscle pain following administration of ciprofloxacin.
A 58-year-old male developed fulminating musculoskeletal pain associated with third-time exposure to ciprofloxacin administered for treatment of chronic otitis media. Symptoms resolved slowly after intense combined analgetic therapy and cessation of ciprofloxacin therapy. 24 h after ciprofloxacin discontinuation the symptoms had completely disappeared and no more analgetic treatment was needed. Laboratory values, especially muscle enzymes, did not reveal any pathological pattern. The patient's past medical history highlighted reproducible side effects with both systemic and local administration of ciprofloxacin including milder symptoms of the musculoskeletal system.
Common side effects of fluoroquinolones include gastrointestinal, central nervous and allergic reactions, but also more uncommon reactions such as tendonitis and rhabdomyolysis. In our case, there had been no signs of rhabdomyolysis. Besides an elevated IgE level no clinical signs of a true anaphylactic reaction associated with release of mast cell mediators had been observed. A pharmacokinetic interaction between ciprofloxacin and the patient's comedication carbamazepine is unlikely to be the responsible mechanism, since fluoroquinolones inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 but not CYP3A4 which metabolizes carbamazepine.
To our knowledge, this is the first report describing fulminating musculoskeletal pain following administration of ciprofloxacin without any signs of rhabdomyolysis. Physicians should notice that there is a variety of adverse reactions of this usually well-tolerated agent and they should be aware of unusual complaints of their patients who receive fluoroquinolone treatment.
Fatty acid compositions were determined in red blood cell (RBC) ghost membranes of schizophrenic patients before and after haloperidol withdrawal, as well as with age-matched normal male control subjects (n = 22). Patients on haloperidol (HD) received treatment in doses between 5 and 20 mg/day for at least 5 weeks (n = 24). Drug-free patients (n = 19) were free of all psychotropic medications for an average of 40 days. A highly significant decrease in the levels (nmol/ml packed RBC) of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly 18:2(n - 6) and 20:4(n - 6), was found in both HD-treated and drug-free patients. This decrease remained in those patients who had withdrawn from HD for more than 5 weeks (n = 10). Concomitantly, the percentage of saturated and monoenoic fatty acids to total fatty acids increased significantly in schizophrenic patients. The resultant fatty acid profile consequently lowers the unsaturation index (UI), which represents the average number of double bonds per fatty acid molecule, in RBC ghost membranes of schizophrenic patients. Furthermore, the decreases in UI were significantly correlated to the increases in "structure order" of RBC ghost membranes as measured by the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (rs) in normal control and drug-free schizophrenic subjects. Therefore, it is likely that decreased levels of PUFAs in schizophrenic patients might result from a defective uptake of 18:2(n - 6) into RBC membrane phospholipids. Since fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids affects the relative degree of membrane fluidity, the present results lend further support that RBC membrane dynamics are altered in schizophrenia.
N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) catalyses the activation and/or deactivation of aromatic and heterocyclic amine carcinogens. A genetic polymorphism in NAT1 is associated with an increased risk of various cancers and drug toxicities, but epidemiological investigations are severely compromised by a poor understanding of the relationship between NAT1 genotype and phenotype. Human reference NAT1*4 and 12 known human NAT1 allelic variants possessing nucleotide polymorphisms in the NAT1 coding region were cloned and expressed in yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Large reductions in N- and O-acetyltransferase catalytic activities were observed for recombinant NAT1 allozymes encoded by NAT1*14B, NAT1*15, NAT1*17, NAT1*19 and NAT1*22. Each of these alleles exhibited NAT1 protein expression levels below the limit of detection as measured by Western blot. No differences between high and low activity NAT1 alleles were observed in relative mRNA expression or relative transformation efficiency. The recombinant NAT1 17 and NAT1 22 allozymes showed reduced intrinsic stability when compared with NAT1 4. 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) N-acetylation was not catalysed by any of the NAT1 allozymes. Large differences in the metabolic activation via O-acetylation of 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (N-hydroxy-PhIP) were noted for NAT1 allelic variants. The results of these studies suggest an important role for the NAT1 genetic polymorphism in metabolism of aromatic and heterocyclic amine carcinogens. Furthermore, these results suggest that low NAT1 phenotype results from NAT1 allelic variants that encode reduced expression of NAT1 and/or less-stable NAT1 protein.
A dietary regimen which induces hepatic fatty acyl desaturase activities increases the lipid fluidity of hepatocyte plasma membranes, both in normal rats and in animals treated with ethinyl estradiol to produce cholestasis. In the cholestatic animals the fluidity change is accompanied by a significant increase in bile flow rate of approx. 33%.
Methamphetamine (METH) is a widely abused psychomotor stimulant known to cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. METH administration selectively damages the dopaminergic nerve terminals, which is hypothesized to be due to release of dopamine from synaptic vesicles within the terminals. This process is believed to be mediated by the production of free radicals. The current study evaluates METH-induced dopaminergic toxicity in pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells cultured in the presence or absence of nerve growth factor (NGF). Dopaminergic changes and the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), a marker for peroxynitrite production, were studied in PC12 cell cultures grown in the presence or absence of NGF after different doses of METH (100-1,000 microM). METH exposure did not cause significant alterations in cell viability and did not produce significant dopaminergic changes or 3-NT production in PC12 cells grown in NGF-negative media after 24 hours. However, cell viability of PC12 cells grown in NGF-positive media was decreased by 45%, and significant dose-dependent dopaminergic alteration and 3-NT production were observed 24 hours after exposure to METH. The current study supports the hypothesis that METH acts at the dopaminergic nerve terminals and produces dopaminergic damage by the production of free radical peroxynitrite.
Three patients experienced severe hypoglycemic encephalopathy during oral therapy of adult-onset diabetes mellitus. Disabling residual neurological deficits were observed in two of these patients. The insidious time course of drug-induced hypoglycemia appeared to prevent patient recognition of sustained hypoglycemia. These cases indicate the need for further caution in the administration of oral hypoglycemic agents.
To examine the cardiovascular response to prostaglandin E1 infusion, we observed hemodynamic changes including left ventricular diameter (an ultrasonic crystal pair) during PGE(1)-induced hypotension in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Left ventricular contractility was assessed primarily by measuring the slope of the left ventricular endsystolic pressure-diameter relation (ESPDR) determined by combining end-systolic points from a vena caval occlusion. The cardiovascular effects of induced hypotension by infusions of trinitroglycerin and adenosine triphosphate were also examined at the equivalent magnitude of hypotension. Approximately 25% reduction of systemic blood pressure was produced by the three agents. PGE(1) significantly increased cardiac output from 1200 +/- 132 to 1439 +/- 162 ml.min(-1) (mean +/- SE, P < 0.05), stroke volume from 9.1 +/- 1.1 to 10.0 +/- 1.0 ml (P < 0.05), and %-diameter shortening from 10.4 +/- 0.8 to 14.4 +/- 0.8% ( P < 0.01), but the slope of ESPDR was unchanged. Similar changes were also observed during adenosine triphosphate-induced hypotension. PGE(1) significantly decreased end-diastolic diameter in a similar manner to trinitroglycerin. Thus PGE(1) appears to have little influence on left ventricular contractility aside from its effects on afterload and preload, indicating that it is a useful agent for producing controlled hypotension during anesthesia.
Fluvastatin, a new synthetic inhibitor of HMGCoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, has been studied in several models to examine its effects when used in combination with other lipid-modifying agents such as derivatives of fibric acid (bezafibrate), resins (cholestyramine), and niacin. The combination of fluvastatin with bezafibrate has been studied in a double-blind trial involving patients with well-documented familial hypercholesterolaemia. Fluvastatin 40 mg/day, combined with either bezafibrate 400 mg/day or cholestyramine 8 g/day, resulted in reductions in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), these being indistinguishable between the groups; however, significantly greater increases in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (21.3%) and reductions in levels of triglycerides (25.1%) were seen with the fluvastatin-bezafibrate combination. No notable increases were seen in levels of serum creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, or alanine aminotransferase, and no cases of myopathy were observed. In a study model that examined low-dose combinations of fluvastatin with cholestyramine, reductions in levels of LDL-C of 15.8% and 19.3% were seen with fluvastatin 10 mg and 20 mg, respectively. After an 8-week interval in which a daily dosage of cholestyramine 8 g was added, from baseline, reductions of 26.3% in the 10 mg fluvastatin-cholestyramine group and 31.2% in the 20 mg fluvastatin-cholestyramine group were observed, whereas the placebo-cholestyramine group displayed a reduction of 14.9%. Doubling the resin dosage to 16 g/day for the final 8 weeks of the study provided little additional benefit. Myotoxicity has been observed when lovastatin is coadministered with niacin, and so the combination of niacin with fluvastatin has also been studied to examine the possibility of this effect occurring. Patients were randomised to either fluvastatin 20 mg or placebo for 6 weeks, after which time open-label niacin was administered to all patients and titrated to a final dosage of 3 g/day. After 6 weeks, fluvastatin produced a 20.8% reduction in LDL-C levels from baseline. When combined with niacin, a 43.7% reduction was noted at the week 15 endpoint, against the 26.5% reduction seen with niacin monotherapy. The combination was well tolerated, with no reports of myopathy or of significant elevations in creatine kinase or liver transaminase levels. Combinations of fluvastatin with a variety of other agents have been shown to have significant effects on lipid profiles, with no evidence to date of clinically remarkable safety findings. Thus, the use of combination therapies may result in optimal management of patients with moderately severe hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemic profiles.
In Part 1 of this report, we review data on the effects of estrogen (E), the anti-E tamoxifen (TMX), and testosterone (T) on methamphetamine (METH)-induced neurotoxicity in female and male CD-1 mice. Treatment of gonadectomized females with a physiological regimen of E significantly diminished the amount of striatal dopamine (DA) depletion to METH compared with non-E-treated mice. If these E-treated mice received coadministered TMX, the neuroprotective effects of E were abolished. However, TMX administration to either intact female or male mice appeared to exhibit a neuroprotective effect. Whereas E administration one week before METH treatment serves as a neuroprotectant, reversing the treatment order (METH-->one week-->E) failed to indicate any neurorestorative effects for E. This striatal DA-preserving effect of E was gender specific, because males receiving an identical treatment of E followed by METH failed to show any evidence of neuroprotection, nor did the predominantly male gonadal steroid hormone T afford any neuroprotection in gonadectomized male or female mice. In the second part of the report, we direct our attention toward examining some of the means by which E can exert this neuroprotective effect. The findings that gonadectomized female, but not intact male, mice treated with E show a significant reduction in body temperature can contribute to the gender-specific METH neuroprotection. E also diminishes the initial amounts of DA evoked by METH, as observed when E is co-infused with METH into superfused striatal tissue fragments of gonadectomized female and male mice. By contrast, T tends to increase METH-evoked DA responses. Finally, differences in mRNA levels were obtained between male and female mice treated with METH. Intact female mice tend to show greater levels of striatal glial fibrillary acidic protein and decreased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 compared with males. Each of these factors, combined with our previous findings that E can inhibit DA transporter function, represent significant events contributing to E/gender-dependent effects on METH neurotoxicity.
Microsphere embolism (ME)-induced up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in endothelial cells of brain microvessels was observed 2-48 h after ischemia. eNOS induction preceded disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) observed 6-72 h after ischemia. In vascular endothelial cells, ME-induced eNOS expression was closely associated with protein tyrosine nitration, which is a marker of generation of peroxynitrite. Leakage of rabbit IgG from microvessels was also evident around protein tyrosine nitration-immunoreactive microvessels. To determine whether eNOS expression and protein tyrosine nitration in vascular endothelial cells mediates BBB disruption in the ME brain, we tested the effect of a novel calmodulin-dependent NOS inhibitor, 3-[2-[4-(3-chloro-2-methylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-5,6-dimethoxy-1-(4-imidazolylmethyl)-1H-indazole dihydrochloride 3.5 hydrate (DY-9760e), which inhibits eNOS activity and, in turn, protein tyrosine nitration. Concomitant with inhibition of protein tyrosine nitration in vascular endothelial cells, DY-9760e significantly inhibited BBB disruption as assessed by Evans blue (EB) excretion. DY-9760e also inhibited cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as a marker of the apoptotic pathway in vascular endothelial cells. Taken together with previous evidence in which DY-9760e inhibited brain edema, ME-induced eNOS expression in vascular endothelial cells likely mediates BBB disruption and, in turn, brain edema.
Methamphetamine (METH) is a major drug of abuse in the United States. A high dose of METH given to mice and rats causes long-lasting depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, dopamine (DA), and DA-transporter (DAT) binding sites in the striatum. In human METH-abusers, a marked decrease of the DAT in the caudate putamen was observed. Despite intensive investigations of the mechanism associated with METH-induced neurotoxicity, the behavioral consequences of this phenomenon are not clear. We used the mouse model of METH-induced neurotoxicity to investigate the response of the animals to the psychomotor-stimulating effect of METH and the rewarding effect of the drug. Mice pre-exposed to a neurotoxic dose of METH developed a marked sensitization to the psychomotor-stimulating effect of METH, which lasted for more than two months. The rewarding effect of METH was determined by the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Mice pre-exposed to the neurotoxic dose of METH showed reduced sensitivity to the rewarding effect of METH compared with control animals. While CPP was maintained for three months in the control group, the conditioned response in the METH pre-exposed animals lasted only a few days. These findings indicate that METH neurotoxicity is associated with opposing and long-lasting behavioral outcomes: (a) sensitization to the psychomotor-stimulating effect of the drug and (b) desensitization to the rewarding properties of the drug. These consequences may be relevant to the psychopathology of METH abuse. Sensitization is pertinent to compulsive drug-seeking behavior that is accompanied by desensitization to the rewarding effect of METH.
Angiotensin given intraventricularly enhances amphetamine but not apomorphine-induced stereotypy 30 min. after peptide administration. Simultaneous injection of angiotensin and dopamine increases amphetamine -- while decreases apomorphine -- induced stereotypy. The stereotypy produced either by apomorphine or amphetamine in rats pretreated with Ro 4-4602 + L-DOPA was diminished by angiotensin. Angiotensin elevated haloperidol-induced catalepsy. A possibility that angiotensin may inhibit both release and uptake of dopamine by nerve endings is discussed.
In a previous clinical trial, the authors disclosed that the expression of tumor cell motility factor gp78hAMFR correlates with tumor progression in patients with bladder carcinoma. This study was initiated to evaluate whether the combination of cytostatic drugs with an antimotility factor has an effect on chemotherapy-resistant bladder carcinoma.
In a Phase II trial, the authors evaluated the influence of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and an antimotility factor (acellular pertussis vaccine [APV]) in 18 patients with cisplatin- and methotrexate-resistant metastatic bladder carcinoma. Intramuscular injection of APV 3 times in the first week, on Days 1, 4, and 7, was followed by paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 and carboplatin 400 mg/m2. After an interval of 1 week APV was given again on Days 15 and 19. Each cycle lasted 3 weeks. On Day 22 the cycle was repeated.
Four of 18 patients had objective responses (2 had complete remissions and 2 had partial remissions). After a median number of 2.5 cycles, side effects did not exceed World Health Organization Grade 4.
The results of this clinical Phase II study demonstrate that the combination of paclitaxel-based therapy causes complete remissions previously not obtained with second-line chemotherapy, although no conclusions can be drawn as to the effectiveness of the individual substances. Further trials have to be evaluated with regard to the individual components.
The adverse side effects of methylphenidate were evaluated in 27 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and IQs of 48 to 74 who participated in a double-blind study of two doses of methylphenidate and placebo. A checklist of 13 side effects, generated from the Physician's Desk Reference, was completed by teachers. Rates of irritability, anxiety, moodiness, and activity level decreased significantly when comparing the placebo with drug conditions. However, medication for six (22%) of the children was discontinued because of the appearance of motor tics (three children) and severe social withdrawal (two children), suggesting that mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may be at a greater risk for developing these side effects than the nonretarded population.
