Puromycin aminonucleoside--(PAN) treated rats develop acute nephrotic syndrome, mimicking human minimal lesion disease. In PAN nephrosis, podocyte detachment from the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is the most likely cause of massive proteinuria in this model. To elucidate further the mechanisms of PAN-induced cellular dysfunction, new methods were employed to visualize podocyte cytoskeletal aggregation and to measure fibrillar attachment to the GBM. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 4/group) received a single tail-vein injection of PAN (75 mg/kg). On days 1, 2, 3, and 5 following injection, 24-hour urine collections were obtained for creatinine clearance, albuminuria, and total proteinuria. Then kidneys from each group were fixed by perfusion. Podocytic cytoskeleton was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Subepithelial GBM staining and attachment fiber number, observed on digitized images of transmission electron micrographs, were quantitated with computer-based density analysis. A significant reduction in attachment fiber number in the GBM lamina rara externa occurred by day 5. On scanning electron micrographs, the secondary and tertiary podocytic processes were observed to be formed by highly aggregated cytoskeleton, which became partially disaggregated by day 3, was totally absent by day 5, and normalized by day 20. Immunogold staining revealed that actin and vinculin localized to the tertiary podocytic processes in the normal state were dispersed into the cell body following PAN. Podocyte cytoskeletal disaggregation precedes, and detachment from the GBM occurs simultaneously with, the onset of massive proteinuria in the PAN model.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the highest grade malignant glioma, is associated with a grim prognosis-median overall survival is in the range 12-15 months, despite optimum treatment. Surgery to the maximum possible extent, external beam radiotherapy, and systemic temozolomide chemotherapy are current standard treatments for newly diagnosed GBM, with intracerebral delivery of carmustine wafers (Gliadel). Unfortunately, the effectiveness of chemotherapy can be hampered by the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT), which confers resistance both to temozolomide and nitrosoureas, for example fotemustine and carmustine. MGMT activity can be measured by PCR and immunohistochemistry, with the former being the current validated technique. High-dose chemotherapy can deplete MGMT levels in GBM cells and has proved feasible in various trials on temozolomide, in both newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM. We here report the unique case of a GBM patient, with high MGMT expression by immunohistochemistry, who underwent an experimental, high-dose fotemustine schedule after surgery and radiotherapy. Although treatment caused two episodes of grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, a complete response and survival of more than three years were achieved, with a 30% increase in dose intensity compared with the standard fotemustine schedule.
Bilateral lesions of the amygdaloid complex in C57BL/6 mice prevented the occurrence of morphine-induced hypermotility (running fit). This effect, that was different from that observed after hippocampal lesions but similar to that observed after caudate lesions, confirms the role of the basal ganglia catecholaminergic system in the development of the motor stimulation consecutive to the administration of this opiate receptor agonist.
Topiramate (TPM) is a novel neurotherapeutic agent approved for the treatment of epilepsy and for migraine prophylaxis. It has been observed that in obese-associated, type 2 diabetic rodent models, TPM treatment reduced the body weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced glucose-regulated insulin release. A long-term treatment with TPM thus ameliorated obesity and diabetic syndromes in female Zucker diabetic fatty rats and db/db mice. The molecular mechanisms of TPM antiobesity and antidiabetic effects remain unknown. We have applied DNA microarray technology to explore genes that might be involved in the mechanisms by which TPM improves insulin sensitivity and blood glucose handling, as well as body weight control. In female Zucker diabetic fatty rats, 7-day TPM treatment significantly reduced the plasma levels of glucose and triglyceride in a dose-dependent manner. The DNA microarray data revealed that TPM treatment altered messenger RNA profiles in liver, hypothalamus, white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. The most marked effect of TPM on gene expression occurred in liver with those genes related with metabolic enzymes and signaling regulatory proteins involved in energy metabolism. TPM treatment decreased messenger RNA amounts for sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase-1, choline kinase, and fatty acid CoA ligase, long chain 4. TPM also up-regulated 3 cholesterol synthesis genes. In addition, the short-term effect of TPM on gene expression was examined at 16 hours after a single administration. TPM markedly reduced hepatic expression of genes related with fatty acid synthesis, eg, stearoyl-CoA desaturase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. TPM also changed genes related with fatty acid beta-oxidation, increased 3-2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase and mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase, and decreased fatty acid CoA ligase (long chain 2 and long chain 5). These gene expression changes were independent of food intake as shown by pair feeding. Our results suggest that TPM regulates hepatic expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, which could be part of the mechanisms by which TPM reduces plasma triglyceride levels in obese diabetic rodents.
Randomized controlled studies suggest an increased incidence of perioperative wound complications among sirolimus-treated renal transplant patients. The present study analyzed the effect of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) on these postoperative complications.
Four hundred and twelve renal transplants were performed and managed postoperatively at two University-affiliated hospitals between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003. The patients received corticosteroids and Sirolimus, with delayed introduction of cyclosporine when the serum creatinine had decreased below 2.5 mg/dL. Two groups of patients were discriminated: group 1 received Basiliximab 20 mg on day 0 and day 4 (n = 283); group 2 recipients with a high panel of reactive antibody (PRA > 20%) and retransplant patients received rATG for induction (n = 129) for a maximum of 2 weeks postoperatively. The incidence of rejection was 14.5% for group 1 vs. 8.5% for group 2 patients. To avoid confounding variable associated with the rejection treatment, any patient with rejection was excluded for statistical analysis, as were patients with follow- up less than 30 days. The final study group for analysis included 350 patients: 235 with Basiliximab induction (group 1) and 115 rATG induction (group 2). The mean follow-up was 21.8 +/- 11 months. Differences in the incidences of postoperative hernia, wound infections, or lymphoceles requiring any form of drainage were analyzed for statistical significance using the chi-square test.
The percentage of patients with wound complications was 26.0% versus 39.1% (P < .025) for group 1 versus group 2, respectively. Incisional hernias occurred in 10.6% versus 18.3% patients (P < .05), wound infections in 11.1% versus 16.5% (P = NS), and lymphoceles in 10.6% versus 15.9% (P = NS) for the two groups, respectively.
rATG-induced renal transplants recipients treated with sirolimus, cyclosporine, and steroids show a significantly increased incidence of postoperative incisional hernias and a trend toward a greater number of lymphocele and wound infection complications.
122 Schizophrenic patients treated with injections of fluphenazine ethanate, 97 with fluphenazine decanoate and 199 with flupenthixol decanoate were followed up for mean times of 41, 33 and 21 months respectively. Their progress was compared by examining reasons for discontinuing injections and outcome in three separate groups defined according to first preparation given; relating the events causing patients to discontinue injections or be readmitted to patient-months spent on each drug; and analysing reasons for inter-drug transfers 43 per cent, 24 per cent and 23 per cent respectively of these three groups of patients discontinued the injections. Severe extrapyramidal effects were most frequent with fluphenazine ethanate, intermediate with fluphenazine decanote, and least frequent frequent with flupenthixol. Lack of cooperation was rather more frequent with flupenthixol than with the other drugs. Severe depression occurred with all three. More patients on fluphenazine injections were transferred for any reason to flupenthixol than vice-versa. A case of 'irreversible' movement disorder was seen with each preparation. It is suggested that current maintenance doses of flupenthixol decanoate are too low.
Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene due to 5q35 microdeletions or intragenic mutations causes Sotos syndrome (SoS). In 46 of the 49 Japanese deletion cases, common deletion breakpoints were located at two flanking low copy repeats (LCRs), implying that non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between LCRs is the major mechanism for the common deletion. In the other three cases of atypical deletions, the mechanism(s) of deletions remains unanswered. We characterized the atypical microdeletions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Southern blot hybridization. All the deletion breakpoints in the three cases were successfully determined at the nucleotide level. Two deletions are 1.07 Mb (SoS19) and 1.23 Mb (SoS109) in size, and another consisted of two deletions with sizes of 28 kb and 0.72 Mb, intervened by an intact 29-kb segment (SoS44). All deletions were smaller than a typical 1.9-Mb common deletion. Alu elements were identified in both deletion breakpoints in SoS19, one of deletion breakpoints in SoS109, and both deletion breakpoints of the proximal 28-kb deletion in SoS44. Alu-mediated NAHR is strongly suggested at least in two of atypical deletions. Finally, qPCR is a very useful method to determine deletion breakpoints even in repeat-related regions.
An 11-year-old girl had a one-day history of nausea and vomiting for which her family physician prescribed 4 suppositories of prochlorperazine 25 mg. Five hours after the last dose she developed dystonic posturing; she recovered rapidly after intramuscular injection of 40 mg orphenadrine.
Cushing's syndrome of glucocorticoid excess is named after the eminent Boston neurosurgeon Harvey W. Cushing (1869-1939). The recognition that glucocorticoid excess produces hypertension led to examination of the role of cortisol in essential hypertension, but it is only over the last decade that evidence has emerged to support the concept. Despite the widespread assumption that cortisol raises blood pressure as a consequence of renal sodium retention, there are few data consistent with the notion. Although it has a plethora of actions on brain, heart and blood vessels, kidney, and body fluid compartments, precisely how cortisol elevates blood pressure is unclear. Candidate mechanisms currently being examined include inhibition of the vasodilator nitric oxide system and increases in vasoconstrictor erythropoietin concentration.
The therapeutic potential of salbutamol, a beta2-adrenergic agonist, was explored in collagen-induced arthritis. This study was based on a report that salbutamol, by elevating intracellular cAMP, inhibits IL-12 production by macrophages and dendritic cells, thus preventing Th1 development. Ten-week-old male DBA/1 mice were immunized by intradermal injection of type II collagen in CFA. Arthritis developed 15-30 days later and the mice were treated after onset of disease with salbutamol, 200 microgram i.p. After 10 days, the mice were sacrificed, and the hind paws were evaluated histologically. Salbutamol, 200 microgram daily or every other day, had a profound therapeutic effect on the clinical progression of arthritis, as assessed by clinical score and paw thickness. The therapeutic effect was dose dependent. Daily administration of 200 microgram of salbutamol offered the best protection against joint damage, as assessed by histology. In vitro, salbutamol reduced IL-12 and TNF-alpha release by peritoneal macrophages in a dose-dependent manner, as well as TNF release by synovial cells from arthritic mice. Ex vivo, draining lymph node cells of the salbutamol-treated arthritic mice showed a diminished CII-specific IFN-gamma production and proliferation. In vivo, salbutamol specifically blocked mast cell degranulation in joint tissues. In conclusion, salbutamol has important effects on the immunoinflammatory response and a significant therapeutic action in collagen-induced arthritis.
Metastatic bone disease represents the most disabling complication in patients with prostatic carcinoma. In an open multicenter trial 80 out of 92 patients with bone metastasis due to prostatic carcinoma experienced a dramatic improvement of bone pain after treatment with 300 mg clodronate infused intravenously daily for 10 days. Further to this, 56 patients were randomly allocated to four single-blind controlled therapeutic trials, assessing bone pain by daily consumption of analgesic drugs and by visual analogue scale. In the first protocol the effects of 2 weeks' treatment with intravenous infusion of either 300 mg clodronate dissolved in 500 ml saline (7 patients) or 500 ml saline (6 patients) were compared. The differences in both pain score and analgesic consumption were so striking that the trial was not extended for ethical reasons and all patients on placebo were given clodronate intravenously. Oral administration of 1200 mg clodronate for 2 weeks was completely ineffective in 11 patients. Intramuscular administration of 100 mg clodronate for 2 weeks induced in 12 patients a significant fall in analgesic consumption but not in the pain score. In most of the 13 patients given clodronate intravenously for 2 weeks bone pain relapsed fairly soon. However, in 18 patients a maintenance therapy with 1200 mg clodronate/day for at least 6 weeks after a 2-week intravenous treatment course did prevent the relapse of bone pain. In all patients given clodronate routine biochemical examination was carried out during and after treatment. For an overall follow-up of 42 patient-years hematologic toxicity was never observed. These results confirm that clodronate represents the most effective and convenient conservative treatment of patients with painful bone metastasis from prostatic carcinoma.
5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the key enzyme in leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis from arachidonic acid (AA). Here, we examined the role of the 5-LO-product, cysteinyl-LT (Cys-LT), with a 5-LO inhibitor (zileuton) and a Cys-LT, receptor antagonist (montelukast), in the inflammatory response and tissue injury associated with spinal cord injury (SCI).
SCI was induced in mice by the application of vascular clips to the dura via a two-level T6 to T7 laminectomy for 1 min. Cord inflammation was assessed histologically and by measuring inflammatory mediators (ELISA) and apoptosis by annexin V, TUNEL, Fas ligand staining and Bax and Bcl-2 expression (immunohistochemistry and western blots). Motor function in hindlimbs was assessed by a locomotor rating scale, for 10 days after cord injury.
SCI in mice resulted in tissue damage, oedema, neutrophil infiltration, apoptosis, tumour necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) production, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in injured tissue. Treatment of the mice with zileuton or montelukast reduced the spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury, neutrophil infiltration, TNF-alpha, COX-2 and pERK1/2 expression, PGE(2) and LTB(4) production, and apoptosis. In separate experiments, zileuton or montelukast significantly improved the recovery of limb function over 10 days.
Zileuton and montelukast produced a substantial reduction of inflammatory events associated with experimental SCI. Our data underline the important role of 5-LO and Cys-LT in neurotrauma.
Isoproterenol (Iso) was a clinical therapeutic that is now used as a research means for the induction of cardiac hypertrophy. Currently, dobutamine (Dob) has replaced Iso as the preferred inotropic beta-adrenergic agent to wean patients from cardiopulmonary bypass and to sustain adequate cardiac function during the postoperative period. We sought to compare the cardiac structural and functional effects of long-term administration (7days) of Iso with Dob at a dose of 40microg/mouse/day in 12-week-old C57BL/6 female mice. Cardiac function was determined with transthoracic echo cardiography (ECHO) 24 hours after the last dose. Cardiac wet weights increased 33% and 24% in the Iso and Dob groups compared with controls (p < 0.05). Dob and Iso significantly increased cardiac fibrosis and decreased cardiac function with chronic administration. Administration also resulted in increased left atrial size, suggesting that both Dob and Iso decreased LV compliance, but did not induce heart failure. In conclusion, chronic administration of Dob may have a detrimental effect on cardiac structure and function.
We report the development of the carpal tunnel syndrome in 3 hypertensive men (aged 46-58) treated with beta-blockers (propranolol in two patients and metoprolol in the 3rd) for 8-11 years. Known causes of carpal tunnel syndrome were excluded in each case. Withdrawal of the beta-blocker was followed by complete resolution of symptoms and signs after a period of 8-10 weeks. No evidence of recurrence could be detected during follow-up of 7-18 months. The possible mechanisms of drug-induced carpal tunnel syndrome are briefly discussed.
Polymorphism of the dopamine receptor type-2 (D(2)) gene is associated with essential hypertension. To assess whether D(2) receptors participate in regulation of blood pressure (BP), we studied mice in which the D(2) receptor was disrupted. In anesthetized mice, systolic and diastolic BPs (in millimeters of mercury) were higher in D(2) homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice than in D(2)+/+ littermates. BP after alpha-adrenergic blockade decreased to a greater extent in D(2)-/- mice than in D(2)+/+ mice. Epinephrine excretion was greater in D(2)-/- mice than in D(2)+/+ mice, and acute adrenalectomy decreased BP to a similar level in D(2)-/- and D(2)+/+ mice. An endothelin B (ET[B]) receptor blocker for both ET(B1) and ET(B2) receptors decreased, whereas a selective ET(B1) blocker increased, BP in D(2)-/- mice but not D(2)+/+ mice. ET(B) receptor expression was greater in D(2)-/- mice than in D(2)+/+ mice. In contrast, blockade of ET(A) and V(1) vasopressin receptors had no effect on BP in either D(2)-/- or D(2)+/+ mice. The hypotensive effect of an AT(1) antagonist was also similar in D(2)-/- and D(2)+/+ mice. Basal Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activities in renal cortex and medulla were higher in D(2)+/+ mice than in D(2)-/- mice. Urine flow and sodium excretion were higher in D(2)-/- mice than in D(2)+/+ mice before and after acute saline loading. Thus, complete loss of the D(2) receptor results in hypertension that is not due to impairment of sodium excretion. Instead, enhanced vascular reactivity in the D(2) mutant mice may be caused by increased sympathetic and ET(B) receptor activities.
Effects of Saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to (SRBT) on theophylline-induced tachycardia in anesthetized rats and theophylline-induced locomotion and convulsions in mice were examined. An intraduodenal administration of SRBT (1 g/kg) prevented theophylline (5 mg/kg, i.v.)-induced tachycardia in rats. SRBT also attenuated an increase in arterial blood pressure with a slow reduction in heart rate of rats treated with theophylline, with no influence on the plasma level of theophylline. However, SRBT did not change the beating rate of right atrium isolated from rats in the absence or presence of theophylline or isoproterenol. The locomotor activity of theophylline in mice was reduced by the treatment with SRBT. Furthermore, the latency of convulsions in mice induced by administration of theophylline at a higher dose (240 mg/kg, i.p.) was prolonged by treatment with SRBT (1 g/kg, p.o.) and seven out of fifteen mice were saved from death due to convulsions. These results suggest that theophylline-induced tachycardia and central nervous stimulation are suppressed by SRBT and that SRBT may reduce the undesirable actions of theophylline on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems.
AN ANALYSIS OF THE CASE HISTORIES OF NINE PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED EPILEPTIC FITS SHORTLY AFTER STARTING TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS SHOWED THAT ALL OF THEM HAD ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: previous or family history of epilepsy, pre-existing brain damage, cerebral arteriosclerosis, alcoholism, withdrawal of barbiturates, and history of previous electric convulsive therapy. Before prescribing antidepressant drugs these factors should be sought for in the history, and if any are present prophylactic anticonvulsant medication is indicated. From a limited experience we do not think that chlordiazepoxide is adequate to counteract the convulsant effect of antidepressant drugs.
In a five-year analysis of an oral contraceptive trial by the Council for the Investigation of Fertility Control venous effects were the third most troublesome group of side-effects with both combined and sequential therapy. Vein complaints, leg cramps, and thrombophlebitis were significantly more frequent with the combined preparations that contained a relatively low dose of progestogen and a high dose of oestrogen than with the other groups tested. No cases of thrombophlebitis occurred in women taking the strongly oestrogenic sequential groups.Histological examination of uterine curettings showed that most progestogenic combined preparations were associated with a high incidence of dilated endometrial sinusoids, while the oestrogenic sequential regimens and low-dose progestogen-only regimens had a low incidence. The incidence of stromal condensation round the sinusoids correlated with the incidence of leg cramps, and these effects appeared to be specific for each preparation tested.
The use of a continuous bupivacaine extrapleural intercostal nerve block after posterolateral thoracotomy has been shown in randomized controlled studies to be effective in reducing postoperative pain and restoring pulmonary function. It is our hypothesis that when using a continuous infusion for nerve block, a long-acting agent (bupivacaine) is unnecessary and a shorter-acting agent (lidocaine) would offer equivalent results with less systemic toxicity. This study was designed to determine whether lidocaine was as effective as bupivacaine in a continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block after posterolateral thoracotomy because lidocaine is a less toxic analgesic agent. The study was prospectively randomized and double-blinded.
Forty-six patients undergoing elective posterolateral thoracotomy were randomized to blindly receive bupivacaine (n = 23) or lidocaine (n = 23) by continuous infusion pump through an intraoperatively placed indwelling extrapleural catheter. Postoperative pain was assessed for 48 hours by patient-controlled morphine consumption and by linear visual analog scale. There was no statistically significant difference in age, sex, or type of operation between the two groups.
There was no statistically significant difference between the bupivacaine and lidocaine groups in patient-controlled morphine use or in visual analog scale scores.
Lidocaine offers equivalent pain control to bupivacaine when administered for continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block after posterolateral thoracotomy, with less risk of systemic toxicity.
Pretreatment with quipazine, a serotonin agonist, and clomipramine, a selective serotonin neuronal uptake blocker, was found to potentiate the cataleptic effect of haloperidol in a dose-dependent manner in rats. Pretreatment with methysergide, a serotonin antagonist, reduced the cataleptic effect of haloperidol. The results indicate that the cataleptic effect of neuroleptics depends on the balance between the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, and that the serotonergic system exerts an inhibitory influence on the dopaminergic system.
