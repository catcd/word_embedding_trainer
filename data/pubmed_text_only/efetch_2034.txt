In cancer chemotherapy with ifosfamide the occurrence of a drug-related encephalopathy represents a severe adverse-effect of unknown origin. We found that the underlying mechanism resides in the mitochondrial toxicity of ifosfamide metabolites. The electron accepting drug methylene blue can substitute for the demonstrated flavoprotein deficiency and its administration leads to resolution of the encephalopathy in patients. The prophylactic administration of methylene blue is equally effective via another principal mechanism, namely oxidation of the excessive quantity of NADH formed during ifosfamide metabolism. The inhibition by methylene blue of multiple amine oxidase activities also prevents formation of the neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde from ifosfamide-derived chloroethyl amine. Thus, methylene blue exhibits several synergistic modes of actions which enable the dose-limiting neurotoxicity of alkylating chemotherapy with ifosfamide in cancer patients to be overcome.
Identification of etiology of human cancers is important for effective cancer prevention, and attempts to estimate the roles of a variety of environmental carcinogens in human cancers are being made. Here, we applied cDNA microarray technology to estimate whether gene expression profiles of cancers would reflect their etiology. Using rat mammary carcinoma models, expression profiles were analyzed in two groups of carcinomas induced by distinct carcinogens but with the same histological classification. Four carcinomas induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and three carcinomas induced by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and a high-fat diet were analyzed by a GeneChip oligonucleotide microarray that contained approximately 8000 rat genes. By hierarchical clustering analysis, the seven carcinomas were classified into two groups that exactly coincided with the DMBA-induced and the PhIP-induced groups. The correlation coefficient between the two groups was 0.63, and those between any carcinomas within each group ranged from 0.78 to 0.95. In addition, characteristic clusters of genes were also identified that highlighted distinct and common characteristics of both groups. Seventeen genes were down-regulated in the DMBA and up-regulated in the PhIP-induced groups. Thirty-three genes were regulated in the opposite manner. Our results indicated that gene expression profiles in cancers reflect their etiology and suggested a possibility that etiology of cancers could be retrospectively estimated from their expression profiles.
1. Our previous studies suggest that in addition to the cerebral dopaminergic systems the noradrenergic ones have a crucial role in the morphine-induced behavioural sensitization in mice. Therefore the effects of alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan (1 and 3 mg kg(-1), i.p.) on morphine-induced locomotor hyperactivity as well as on morphine-induced changes in cerebral noradrenaline (NA) and striatal dopamine (DA) metabolism were studied in mice withdrawn for 3 days from 5 day repeated morphine treatment. The concentrations of NA, free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MOPEG), DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) were determined. 2. Acute morphine (10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) increased locomotor activity in control and in morphine-withdrawn mice; idazoxan alone did not alter the activity. Idazoxan pretreatment did not alter the locomotor hyperactivity induced by acute morphine in control mice but potentiated it in morphine-withdrawn mice. 3. Acute morphine elevated MOPEG less but increased DOPAC and HVA more clearly in morphine-withdrawn mice than in controls, and decreased 3-MT only in controls. Idazoxan alone did not alter the NA or DA metabolite concentrations in control mice, but elevated MOPEG as well as DOPAC in morphine-withdrawn mice. 4. In control mice idazoxan enhanced acute morphine's elevating effect on MOPEG. In withdrawn mice idazoxan counteracted the tolerance so that acute morphine elevated MOPEG in these mice to about similar level as in controls. 5. Idazoxan pretreatment abolished the HVA increasing effect of acute morphine both in control and withdrawn mice. In control mice idazoxan enhanced morphine's elevating effect on DOPAC and abolished morphine's decreasing effect on 3-MT. Idazoxan did not alter morphine's effects on DOPAC or 3-MT concentrations in withdrawn mice. 6. Our results show that in morphine-withdrawn mice idazoxan pretreatment reveals the morphine-induced locomotor sensitization. This most probably occurs by overcoming the tolerance towards the acute morphine-induced increase of cerebral NA turnover and release. It is suggested that in mice the cerebral noradrenergic in addition to the dopaminergic systems are major determinants of the behavioural sensitization to morphine.
We have tested the effects of cutaneous application of noradrenaline in 35 patients presenting with neuropathic pain. Depending on the outcome of sympatholytic interventions the patients were considered to have sympathetically maintained pain (SMP; n = 25) or sympathetically independent pain (SIP; n = 10). Iontophoretic application or cutaneous injection of noradrenaline into symptomatic skin aggravated pain and mechanical or thermal hyperalgesia in 7/25 SMP patients. Results from differential nerve blocks suggested that noradrenaline-induced ongoing pain and heat hyperalgesia were signalled by unmyelinated afferents, while touch-evoked pain and cold hyperalgesia were signalled by myelinated afferents. In none of the remaining 18/25 SMP patients, 10 SIP patients or 18 normal subjects did application of noradrenaline result in any appreciable increase of pain. A follow-up of 12 patients (initially 9 SMP, 3 SIP) after 12-16 years showed that one individual (previously SMP) was healthy, while 3 patients still suffered from SMP and 8 from SIP. Of the 5 SMP patients who had noradrenaline-induced pain at the initial examination, only 1 SMP patient still responded to noradrenaline with pain and hyperalgesia. Three other patients had changed to SIP and 1 individual was healthy. None of these 4 and none of the 7 initially noradrenaline-unresponsive patients experienced pain to the noradrenaline challenge at follow-up. Thus, cutaneous noradrenaline application can aggravate the pain in some, but not all SMP patients. THe abnormal noradrenaline reaction can change over time as can the pain relieving effects of sympatholytic therapy.
We report a case of rhabdomyolisis in association with alcohol and cocaine intake. An 18 year-old boy consumed cocaine and alcohol and afterwards suffered from hyperthermia and rhabdomyolisis associated with decreased conscious level, severe renal insufficiency requiring hemodialysis, and persistent metabolic acidemia. Creatine phosphokinase raised up to 40.824 UI/l. He recovered two weeks later but a year of kinesiology treatment was required in order to recover strength and muscular mass. Rhabdomyolisis, a well documented complication of cocaine and other undue drugs, has been reported in 24% of cocaine users. The mechanism of cocaine-associated rhabdomyolisis is unclear but should be related with direct toxicity and/or ischemia due to vasoconstriction explained by the inhibition of the presinaptic reuptake of catecholamins. In unexplained cases of rhabdomyolisis, cocaine and other undue drugs consumption should be suspected.
A recent psychobiological theory postulates a dopaminergic basis for the agency facet of extraversion, leading to the prediction that this personality trait modulates the psychophysiological effects of dopaminergic drugs. A single dose of the dopamine D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine reduces blood pressure in healthy volunteers. However, it is currently unknown whether this hypotensive effect of bromocriptine is modulated by agentic extraversion. Therefore, we measured resting cardiovascular activation in groups of healthy male volunteers either high or low in agentic extraversion, either under bromocriptine (1.25 mg) or placebo. Focusing the analyses on activation components derived from 18 cardiovascular variables, we found that bromocriptine reduces alpha-adrenergic activation in the sample as a whole, whereas the effects on beta-adrenergic and cholinergic activation are modulated by agentic extraversion.
5-Fluorouracil, a widely used drug in cancer treatment, is known to have cardiotoxic effects: chest pain with ECG changes, arrhythmias, arterial hypertension or hypotension, myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock and sudden death have been described in the literature. Coronary artery vasospasm is the pathogenetic mechanism hypothesized in most cases, but mechanisms other than myocardial ischemia had been advocated in some patients. The approach to the patient with persistent chest pain, despite therapy and persistent ST-segment elevation mimicking an acute myocardial infarction, has not been well addressed, and the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic pathways have not yet been defined. We present our experience regarding 2 patients treated with 5-fluorouracil and referred to our coronary care unit because of prolonged chest pain (in one case with clinical evidence of hemodynamic impairment) and persistent ST-segment elevation, in whom an acute myocardial infarction was suspected. One patient was treated with systemic fibrinolysis, and coronary angiography was performed 6 days later; the other was submitted to urgent coronary angiography shortly after admission. In both cases the ECG and echocardiographic abnormalities were transient and normalized within a few days, the serum markers of myocardial necrosis were persistently in the normal range and the coronary artery trees were normal. The diagnostic and therapeutic approach to patients with this unusual clinical presentation is also discussed.
In this report we describe the case of a 37-year-old white woman with Ebstein's anomaly, who developed a rare syndrome called platypnea-orthodeoxia, characterized by massive right-to-left interatrial shunting with transient profound hypoxia and cyanosis. This shunt of blood via a patent foramen ovale occurred in the presence of a normal pulmonary artery pressure, and was probably precipitated by a propafenone overdose. This drug caused biventricular dysfunction, due to its negative inotropic effect, and hypotension, due to its peripheral vasodilatory effect. These effects gave rise to an increase in the right atrial pressure and a decrease in the left one with a consequent stretching of the foramen ovale and the creation of massive right-to-left shunting. In our case this interatrial shunt was very accurately detected at bubble contrast echocardiography.
We sought to understand the importance of oxidative stress in explaining why the haptoglobin (Hp) genotype determines myocardial infarction (MI) size in diabetes mellitus (DM).
Two common alleles (1 and 2) exist at the Hp locus in humans. The Hp 2 allele is associated with increased MI size in individuals with DM. In vitro, the Hp 2 protein is associated with increased generation of oxidatively active iron, whereas the Hp 1 protein is associated with increased production of the antioxidant cytokine interleukin (IL)-10.
Myocardial infarction was produced by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in DM C57BL/6 mice carrying the Hp 1 or Hp 2 allele. Myocardial oxidative stress after IR was assessed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Redox active iron and IL-10 were measured in the serum after IR.
Myocardial infarction size was significantly larger in Hp 2 mice as compared with Hp 1 mice (44.3 +/- 9.3% vs. 21.0 +/- 4.0%, p = 0.03), and these larger infarctions were associated with a significant increase in a panel of hydroxyl-eicosatetraenoic acids. Redox active iron was greater in Hp 2 mice (0.45 +/- 0.11 micromol/l vs. 0.14 +/- 0.05 micromol/l, p = 0.02), whereas IL-10 was greater in Hp 1 mice (85.8 +/- 12.9 pg/microl vs. 46.7 +/- 10.8 pg/microl, p = 0.04) after IR. Administration of an antioxidant (BXT-51072) to Hp 2 mice reduced myocardial injury after IR by more than 80% (p = 0.003), but no myocardial protection was provided by the antioxidant to Hp 1 mice.
The increased MI size in DM Hp 2 mice occurring after IR may be due to increased oxidative stress.
Methoxime (MMB-4) is a leading candidate oxime acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reactivator to replace pralidoxime (2-PAM) for therapeutic treatment of nerve agent intoxication. 4-Pyridine aldoxime (4-PA) is a synthetic starting material, a breakdown product, and a probable metabolite of MMB-4. There is a possibility that 4-PA may adversely interact with the nerve agent, thereby affecting nerve agent toxicity and biological AChE activity. This study evaluated the effects of 4-PA on sarin (GB)-, cyclosarin (GF)-, and VX-induced toxicity and AChE activity in blood, brain, and peripheral tissues of guinea pigs. Animals were pretreated with atropine methyl nitrate (1.0 mg/kg, im) 15 min prior to subcutaneous administration with 1.0 x LD(50) of GB, GF, or VX and then treated 15 min after the administration of nerve agents with 4-PA (3.5, 7.0, or 14.0 mg/kg, im). The dose-response effects of 4-PA alone were also examined. Toxic signs and lethality were monitored, blood and tissues were collected, and AChE activities were determined at 60 min after nerve agent administration. Under the condition of this study, all animals exposed to nerve agents exhibited some degree of toxic signs such as salivation, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and convulsions. 4-PA at the three doses tested neither induced toxic signs nor altered the toxicity of GB, GF, or VX at the 1.0 x LD(50) exposure dose. Additionally, it did not modify the AChE activity in blood, brain, and peripheral tissues by itself or affect the AChE activity inhibited by a 1.0 x LD(50) dose of these three nerve agents in guinea pigs.
We recently showed that intrahippocampally administered dopamine and serotonin exert concentration-dependent non-protective, protective and proconvulsant effects against limbic seizures in rats. Anticonvulsant action was mediated via, respectively, hippocampal D2 and 5-HT1A receptor stimulation, while proconvulsant effects were associated with concomitant hippocampal glutamate increases. We here examined whether increases in endogenous hippocampal dopamine and serotonin exert similar actions. Initially, dose-response experiments were performed with intrahippocampal perfusions of GBR-12909 and citalopram, respectively, selective dopamine and serotonin re-uptake blockers. Based on their effects on monoaminergic release, a potential non-protective, protective and proconvulsant concentration was selected. The predicted non-protective GBR-12909 (10 microM) and citalopram (0.5 microM) concentrations failed to prevent pilocarpine-induced seizures. The predicted protective GBR-12909 (100 microM) and citalopram (1 microM) perfusions resulted in complete anticonvulsant action, again mediated by D2 and 5-HT1A receptors. Unexpectedly, at predicted proconvulsant concentrations complete anticonvulsant action was obtained and hippocampal Glu remained unaltered. This study shows that selective monoamine re-uptake blockers have important anticonvulsant properties. Based on the previously established anticonvulsant monoamine ranges, anticonvulsant threshold concentrations can be predicted for compounds with endogenous dopamine or serotonin promoting effects. Non-selective actions curtailing glutamatergic activity may further be responsible for the unexpected anticonvulsant effects at predicted proconvulsant concentrations.
We assessed the 5-year risk of levodopa-induced dyskinesias by age of Parkinson's disease (PD) onset in a population-based cohort. The medical records linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology project was used to identify residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, with incident PD for the period 1976 through 1990. In this population-based study, the 5-year dyskinesia incidence declined with age. With PD onset after 70 years of age, the incidence was 16%. With onset from 40 to 59 years of age, the incidence was higher at 50%. These incidence data may overestimate the functional importance, because patients with minimal or reversible dyskinesias were counted.
Antiplatelets (APs) may increase the risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) following intravenous thrombolysis after ischemic stroke.
We assessed the safety of thrombolysis under APs in 11,865 patients compliant with the European license criteria and recorded between 2002 and 2007 in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke (SITS) International Stroke Thrombolysis Register (SITS-ISTR). Outcome measures of univariable and multivariable analyses included symptomatic ICH (SICH) per SITS Monitoring Study (SITS-MOST [deterioration in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale >or=4 plus ICH type 2 within 24 hours]), per European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II (ECASS II [deterioration in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale >or=4 plus any ICH]), functional outcome at 3 months and mortality.
A total of 3782 (31.9%) patients had received 1 or 2 AP drugs at baseline: 3016 (25.4%) acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), 243 (2.0%) clopidogrel, 175 (1.5%) ASA and dipyridamole, 151 (1.3%) ASA and clopidogrel, and 197 (1.7%) others. Patients receiving APs were 5 years older and had more risk factors than AP naïve patients. Incidences of SICH per SITS-MOST (ECASS II respectively) were as follows: 1.1% (4.1%) AP naïve, 2.5% (6.2%) any AP, 2.5% (5.9%) ASA, 1.7% (4.2%) clopidogrel, 2.3% (5.9%) ASA and dipyridamole, and 4.1% (13.4%) ASA and clopidogrel. In multivariable analyses, the combination of ASA and clopidogrel was associated with increased risk for SICH per ECASS II (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.29 to 3.45; P=0.003). However, we found no significant increase in the risk for mortality or poor functional outcome, irrespective of the AP subgroup or SICH definition.
The absolute excess of SICH of 1.4% (2.1%) in the pooled AP group is small compared with the benefit of thrombolysis seen in randomized trials. Although caution is warranted in patients receiving the combination of ASA and clopidogrel, AP treatment should not be considered a contraindication to thrombolysis.
The authors report several cases showing that use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications containing decongestants can cause hypertensive reactions in patients who are treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Patient instructions accompanying OTC products (particularly those containing phenylpropanolamine) often omit specific warnings about the dangers of those products' concomitant use with MAOIs. Of further concern is the opportunity for patients to be confused by the similarity in names between some prohibited combination products and other more pharmacologically innocuous products that are acceptable for concomitant use.
Oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity is frequently dose-limiting. Following retrospective studies suggesting neuroprotective effects of calcium and magnesium (Ca and Mg), we conducted a prospective study using nerve conduction studies (NCS) to evaluate the effectiveness of such infusions in oxaliplatin-related neuropathy.
Colorectal cancer patients receiving FOLFOX-4 or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin were randomized to (Arm A) calcium gluconate 1g +15% magnesium sulphate 1g diluted in 100 mL of dextrose 5% or (Arm B) placebo. Neuropathy was assessed using the National Cancer Center common toxicity criteria, oxaliplatin-specific scale and NCS.
  This study was terminated prematurely based on the initial negative results of the CONcePT trial. Median follow up was 8.7 months. Overall 22 out of 27 patients experienced neuropathy. The subjective neuropathy rate was 77% in Arm A and 86% in Arm B, (P = 0.6). At the end of treatment, three patients in Arm A and 0 in Arm B had grade 3 numbness (P = 0.09). There was no significant difference in neuropathy between arms, whether during or at the end of treatment. Median objective neuropathy score was 6 in Arm A and 0 in Arm B, (P = 0.02).
Premature closure of this study limits the interpretation of results. While there was a trend towards reduced subjective acute sensory neuropathy with Ca and Mg, this was not significant. Ca and Mg failed to reduce the rate of cumulative sensory neuropathy and instead increased the rate of abnormal NCS, suggesting a significant difference in perceived sensory and objective neuropathy.
The field of genomics has great potential in toxicology; however, the technology is still in its infancy and there are many questions that need to be addressed. In this study we focus on the use of toxicogenomics for the determination of gene expression changes associated with hepatotoxicity. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was used to assess the toxic effects of two well-studied hepatotoxins, carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) and ethanol (EtOH). Replicate dishes of HepG2 cells were exposed to two concentrations of CCl(4) and EtOH--doses which caused 20% and 50% cell death (as determined by the MTT assay) were chosen [0.18% and 0.4% (v/v) CCl(4); 2.5% and 5% (v/v) EtOH] and the cells exposed for periods of 2 and 24 h. mRNA was extracted and used to probe Atlas Human Toxicology II arrays (Clontech). Preliminary data revealed that following a 2-h exposure at the low doses of both compounds, few changes in gene expression were detected. However, after 24-h exposure of the cells to the same low concentration of both compounds, multiple changes in gene expression were observed, many of which were specific to the individual hepatotoxins, presumably reflecting their different mechanisms of action. CCl(4) treatment of HepG2 cells gave rise to treatment specific up-regulation of genes involved in extracellular transport and cell signalling, whereas EtOH treatment gave rise predominantly to down-regulation of genes involved in stress response and metabolism. In addition, changes in regulation of certain genes (involved in stress response and cell cycle) were common to both treatments. Exposure of HepG2 cells to higher doses of the hepatotoxins gave rise to more changes in gene expression at lower exposure times. These results strongly suggest that different mechanisms of hepatotoxicity may be associated with specific patterns of gene expression, while some genes associated with common cellular responses may be useful as early markers of toxicity.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most frequent psychiatric disorder in children and adolescents and is often treated with methylphenidate (MPH), resulting in MPH exposure in more than 1% of all children in many countries. A 2005 report on cytogenetic effects in peripheral lymphocytes from 12 ADHD children treated for 3 months with MPH raised questions about its genetic toxicity and potential carcinogenicity. In 2007, we described no elevated micronucleus frequency in 21 children after 3 months of MPH-treatment; since the difference between the two studies could not be explained we now enlarged the overall sample size, and added a healthy control group, a new chronically treated group and positive control slides. Furthermore, micronuclei were analyzed in a second tissue, buccal mucosa.
A healthy control group (23 individuals), a chronically MPH-treated (>12 months) group (21 patients), and a drug naïve group of ADHD-affected children (26 patients), which was analyzed again after 3 months (17 patients) and 6 months (11 patients), provided samples for analysis of micronucleated lymphocytes. With inclusion of 14 previously obtained blood samples, an overall group size of 31 patients was reached for the comparison of the 3 months observation time with before for micronucleated lymphocytes. For buccal mucosa cells, an additional inclusion of 10 more chronically treated patients (no lymphocytes donated) yielded sample numbers of 22 (healthy), 17 (chronically treated), 23 (ADHD drug naïve), 14 (3 months) and 11 (6 months).
No significant alteration in genomic damage as seen as micronucleus frequency in peripheral lypmphocytes or buccal mucosa cells was detected after MPH treatment.
No indication for genomic damage induced by MPH was obtained in this study, as in our previous study. Together with our previous study, our overall number of MPH-treated patients is now 68 (30 chronically treated, 38 prospectively followed), plus 23 healthy controls. Ongoing studies in the USA, as well as continuation of recently published epidemiological cancer incidence analysis should provide additional reassurance for MPH-treated ADHD patients.
Nevirapine is associated with idiosyncratic reactions such as skin rash, hepatitis and hypersensitivity syndrome, which have the hallmarks of being immune mediated. However, there is little laboratory evidence to support an immune pathogenesis.
A HIV-positive individual who developed hepatitis within 6 weeks of starting nevirapine, in the absence of any cutaneous manifestations, is described. Other causes of hepatitis were excluded, and the patients liver function normalized on withdrawal of nevirapine. Lymphocytes from the patient, and six individuals with HIV who were on nevirapine without adverse effects, were exposed to nevirapine and its metabolites, and lymphocyte proliferation assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation on day 5.
The T cells taken from the nevirapine-hypersensitive patient proliferated in the presence of nevirapine with a stimulation index of greater than 2. There was no proliferation with nevirapine metabolites. T cells taken from HIV-positive control individuals showed no proliferation with either nevirapine or its metabolites.
The results from our patient suggest that T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of nevirapine-induced hepatitis. Larger numbers of patients need to be studied to fully evaluate the role of T cells in nevirapine-induced hepatitis and nevirapine hypersensitivity syndrome.
Advanced chronic hepatic disease was observed in 5 dogs that had received anticonvulsant drug therapy for 2 to 3 years. Clinical signs included anorexia, weakness, and restlessness, and 2 dogs also had ascites. There were remarkable increases in the serum activities of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase. The total serum bile acid concentration was high in 3 of 4 dogs that were tested. Sulfobromophthalein excretion was delayed in all dogs. Histologic examination of liver specimens from 4 of the dogs demonstrated macronodular or micronodular cirrhosis.
The Sturge-Weber syndrome is a sporadic congenital neurocutaneous disorder characterized by a port-wine stain affecting the skin in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, abnormal capillary venous vessels in the leptomeninges of the brain and choroid, glaucoma, seizures, stroke, and intellectual disability. It has been hypothesized that somatic mosaic mutations disrupting vascular development cause both the Sturge-Weber syndrome and port-wine stains, and the severity and extent of presentation are determined by the developmental time point at which the mutations occurred. To date, no such mutation has been identified.
We performed whole-genome sequencing of DNA from paired samples of visibly affected and normal tissue from 3 persons with the Sturge-Weber syndrome. We tested for the presence of a somatic mosaic mutation in 97 samples from 50 persons with the Sturge-Weber syndrome, a port-wine stain, or neither (controls), using amplicon sequencing and SNaPshot assays, and investigated the effects of the mutation on downstream signaling, using phosphorylation-specific antibodies for relevant effectors and a luciferase reporter assay.
We identified a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant (c.548G→A, p.Arg183Gln) in GNAQ in samples of affected tissue from 88% of the participants (23 of 26) with the Sturge-Weber syndrome and from 92% of the participants (12 of 13) with apparently nonsyndromic port-wine stains, but not in any of the samples of affected tissue from 4 participants with an unrelated cerebrovascular malformation or in any of the samples from the 6 controls. The prevalence of the mutant allele in affected tissues ranged from 1.0 to 18.1%. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity was modestly increased during transgenic expression of mutant Gαq.
The Sturge-Weber syndrome and port-wine stains are caused by a somatic activating mutation in GNAQ. This finding confirms a long-standing hypothesis. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and Hunter's Dream for a Cure Foundation.).
A 5-year-old German Shepherd dog which presented for total hip replacement developed myoclonus and urinary retention after the subarachnoid injection of preservative-free morphine. Myoclonus was resistant to treatment, except pentobarbital anesthesia. Urinary retention was treated with bethanechol and subsided within a few days. Involuntary muscular activity can result from the epidural, subarachnoid or systemic injection of various opioid drugs, or as a result of the toxic or irritant effect of preservatives or autologous blood. The latter were not causative factors in this case. Opioid agonist inhibition of central inhibitory neurotransmitter action may have explained the myoclonus. Postoperative urinary retention was attributed to the spinal action of morphine inhibiting efferent parasympathetic nervous activity.
Nicotine, one of the most dangerous substances in tobacco, can pass the placenta and affect the fetal hemodynamics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of melatonin on hearts of nicotine exposed newborn rats whose mothers received nicotine.
This is an experimental, randomized, controlled study. Study groups were composed of five groups of rats; high-dose nicotine (HDN), HDN+melatonin (HDNM), low-dose nicotine (LDN), LDN+melatonin (LDNM), control. Myocardial and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide(NO), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were analyzed and myocardial tissue was examined histopathologically. Comparisons of groups were done with Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis test. All pairwise multiple comparisons and the comparisons between control and other groups were done with Dunn's nonparametric multiple comparison test.
Plasma and tissue MDA levels among groups were different (p=0.001 for plasma MDA and p=0.001 for tissue MDA). Plasma MDA levels of HDN, HDNM, LDN, and tissue MDA levels of HDN and LDN were significantly higher than in control group (p<0.05 for plasma MDA and for tissue MDA). Plasma and tissue NO levels among groups were also different (p=0.011 for plasma NO and p=0.001 for tissue NO). Plasma NO of LDN group was higher than of LDNM group, and plasma NO of LDNM group was lower than in control group (p<0.05). Tissue NO levels of HDN and LDN groups were higher than of control group (p<0.05). There was no difference between plasma GSHPx levels among groups (p=0.221) but statistically significant different was detected between tissue GSHPx levels among groups (p=0.001). Tissue GSHPx level was found lower in HDN group than in control group (p<0.05). Tissue GSHPx level of LDNM group was higher than of LDN group, and tissue GSHPx level of HDNM group was higher than of HDN group (p<0.05). A difference was found between plasma and tissue SOD among groups (p=0.005 for plasma SOD and p=0.001 for tissue SOD). Plasma SOD of LDN group was significantly lower than of HDNM and LDNM groups (p<0.05). Tissue SOD analyzes revealed lower levels in HDN and LDN groups than in control group (p<0.05). Severe cardiomyopathy was determined in HDN and LDN groups (p<0.05).
Nicotine exposure depletes myocardial antioxidant enzymes and increases free radicals and lipid peroxidation products. Melatonin particularly prevents the nicotine-induced cardiac injury as an antioxidant.
This paper reports the ameliorative effect of Probucol (Pb) on ADR-induced nephrotic rats. Male Wistar rats underwent unilateral nephrectomy followed by one-week subsequent intravenous injection of 4.0 mg/kg of ADR. The rats were then divided into 3 groups: Pb-treated, non-treated and the control. The control group received 0.9% saline (vehicle) by injection. The 24-hr urinary protein excretion was measured for 24 weeks. When the animals were sacrificed at weeks 4, 12, and 24, respectively, blood samples were collected for biochemical study and the kidneys were extracted for measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA). In the morphological study, glomerular volume, glomerular sclerosis in dex (GSI), and tubulointerstitial index (TII) were calculated. Pb treatment lowered the serum lipid level and 24-hr urinary protein excretion. Total cholesterol was closely correlated with the urinary protein. However, there was no difference in terms of glomerular volume, kidney weight and GSI between the two groups. Pb treatment suppressed the kidney tissue MDA and TII significantly, the values of which were mutually correlated. The 24-hr protein excretion was significantly correlated with TII, but not with GSI. The decreased proteinuria was explained on the basis of suppression of enhancement of intraglomerular pressure induced by interstitial lesion. The findings suggest that renoprotection of Pb may derive from the amelioration of interstitial lesions.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects (up to 6 months) of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) use on renal function in patients being treated for HIV-1 infection.
The charts of 447 HIV-1-infected patients who received at least three months of tenofovir DF treatment were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, concurrent antiretrovirals, other concurrent medications, CD4 counts and HIV-1 viral loads, and serum creatinine values while on tenofovir DF. Data collection was truncated at 6 months.
Baseline serum creatinine (SCr) was 1.0 mg/dL, with a calculated creatinine clearance (CLCr) of 95.2 mL/min (using the Cockroft-Gault equation). There was no significant change in SCr or CLCr at 12 weeks (1.1 mg/dL and 92.7 mL/min, respectively) or 24 weeks (1.1 mg/dL and 92.9 mL/min, respectively). All three patients with grade 2 increases in SCr had other medical reasons for an increased SCr (one patient each had indinavir-associated nephrolithiasis, lactic acidosis, and pancreatitis). No patients experienced any complications from these increases in SCr.
Increases in SCr and CLCr within the first 6 months of tenofovir DF therapy were rare. Although no clinical nephrotoxicity was observed, continued observation of renal function is warranted in patients predisposed to renal impairment.
The adjuvant effect of particles on allergic immune responses has been shown to increase with decreasing particle size and increasing particle surface area. Like ultrafine particles, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have nano-sized dimensions and a large relative surface area and might thus increase allergic responses. Therefore, we examined whether single-walled (sw) and multi-walled (mw) CNTs have the capacity to promote allergic responses in mice, first in an sc injection model and thereafter in an intranasal model. Balb/cA mice were exposed to three doses of swCNT, mwCNT, as well as ultrafine carbon black particles (ufCBPs, Printex90) during sensitization with the allergen ovalbumin (OVA). Five days after an OVA booster, OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies in serum and the numbers of inflammatory cells and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. Furthermore, ex vivo OVA-induced cytokine release from mediastinal lymph node (MLN) cells was measured. In separate experiments, differential cell counts were determined in BALF 24 h after a single intranasal exposure to the particles in the absence of allergen. We demonstrate that both swCNT and mwCNT together with OVA strongly increased serum levels of OVA-specific IgE, the number of eosinophils in BALF, and the secretion of Th2-associated cytokines in the MLN. On the other hand, only mwCNT and ufCBP with OVA increased IgG2a levels, neutrophil cell numbers, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in BALF, as well as the acute influx of neutrophils after exposure to the particles alone. This study demonstrates that CNTs promote allergic responses in mice.
