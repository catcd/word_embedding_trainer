Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been implicated in the aetiology of acute renal failure (ARF), but epidemiological studies examining this association have produced disparate results. We conducted a case-control study using a purpose-built record-linkage database for a population of 420,600 patients, resident in Tayside since May 1990. Patients (n = 207) hospitalized with a diagnostic code for ARF between 1990 and 1992 had their diagnosis validated by a renal physician. Six community controls and two hospital controls, matched for age and sex, were generated for each of these cases. Exposure to dispensed oral NSAIDs, topical NSAIDs and aspirin during the 90 days prior to the index date were investigated (recent exposure), as was exposure at any time since January 1989 (previous exposure). The most significant associations were modelled using conditional logistic regression. When community controls were used, recent exposure to NSAIDs and previous exposure to aspirin were independently associated with hospitalization for ARF, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.20 (1.49-3.25) and 2.19 (1.46-3.30), respectively. Only recent exposure to oral NSAIDs was associated when hospital controls were used: 1.84 (1.14-2.93). No significant interactions were present with previous chronic renal failure, other possible causes of ARF or whether the diagnosis was primary or secondary. There is an approximate doubling of the risk of hospitalization for ARF with use of oral NSAIDs.
To investigate the modulation of lung local immune responses of hesperidin (HES) on the acute lung inflammation induced by LPS in vivo. Mice were challenged with intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (100 microg) 30 min before with treatment hesperidin (200 mg/kg oral administration) or vehicle. After 4 and 24 h, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained to measure proinflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6), anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL-4, IL-12) cytokines, chemokines (KC, MCP-1 and MIP-2), total cell counts, nitric oxide production, and proteins. Lung histology was performed in inflated-fixed lungs. Hesperidin downregulate the LPS-induced expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, KC, MIP-2, MCP-1, and IL-12. It also enhanced the production of IL-4, IL-10. Total leukocyte counts; nitric oxide production, iNOS expression, and proteins were significantly decreased by hesperidin. In vitro, HES suppressed the expression of IL-8 on A549 cells and THP-1 cells, the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 on THP-1 cells, the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on A549 cells which effect cell adhesion function. The suppression of those molecules is controlled by NF-kappaB and AP-1, which are activated by I kappa B and MAPK pathways. HES inhibits those pathways, thereby suppressing the expression of IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-12, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. This study indicates that HES had a markedly immunomodulatory effect in a clinically relevant model of ARDS. Nevertheless, further investigations are required to determine the potential clinical usefulness of HES in the adjunctive therapy of ARDS.
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) pumps a wide range of cytotoxic drugs out of cells. Inhibiting maturation of P-gp would be a novel method for circumventing P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance, which complicates cancer chemotherapy and treatment of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. We examined the effect of disulfiram (Antabuse(TM)) on the maturation and activity of P-gp.
Embryonic kidney cells were transfected with a complementary DNA for the P-pg gene, and the effects of disulfiram on the sensitivity of the transfected cells to cytotoxic agents were determined. Enzyme assays were used to determine the effects of disulfiram on the verapamil-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of P-gp. Disulfiram modifies cysteine residues, and mutant forms of P-gp that lack individual cysteines were used to determine whether particular cysteine residues mediate disulfiram's effects on P-gp activity. Maturation of recombinant P-gp was followed on immunoblots.
Disulfiram increased the sensitivity of P-gp-transfected cells to vinblastine and colchicine and inhibited P-gp's verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. Half-maximal inhibition of ATPase activity occurred at 13.5 microM disulfiram. Disulfiram (at 100 microM) inhibited a P-gp mutant by 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 37%-48%) when cysteine was present at position 431 only and by 72% (95% CI = 66%-77%) when cysteine was present at position 1074 only. Treatment of P-gp-transfected cells with 50 nM disulfiram blocked maturation of recombinant P-gp.
Disulfiram can potentially reduce P-gp-mediated drug resistance by inhibiting P-gp activity (possibly via cysteine modification) and/or by blocking its maturation. These results suggest that disulfiram has the potential to increase the efficacy of drug therapies for cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
To compare the effect on antihypertensive efficacy produced by the addition of indomethacin to the angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist, valsartan, or to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, in hypertensive patients with chronic osteoarthritis.
One hundred and twenty-eight patients (52 men and 76 women) aged 25-82 years (mean age 55.7 years), with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 100 mmHg at the end of a 2-week placebo washout period were allocated randomly to groups to receive valsartan (80-160 mg once daily) or lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily). At the end of 10 weeks of treatment, patients with DBP < 90 mmHg, while continuing to receive valsartan or lisinopril treatment, were allocated randomly to groups to receive either indomethacin (50 mg three times a day) or the corresponding placebo for 2 weeks, with a 1-week washout period between the two treatments, according to a double-blind, crossover design. After the initial washout period, patients were examined at the end of the 4th, 8th and 10th weeks of randomized treatment with valsartan and lisinopril, at the end of the first crossover period and then at the beginning and at the end of the second crossover period. At each visit, sitting and standing blood pressure were measured by standard mercury sphygmomanometer.
The addition of indomethacin blunted the blood pressure-decreasing effect of both antihypertensive drugs. Although indomethacin produced greater increases in both systolic and DBP values in the lisinopril-treated patients (5.45/3.22 mmHg) than in the valsartan-treated ones (2.12/1.87 mmHg), no significant difference between the two drugs was found.
From a theoretical standpoint, these findings suggest that prostaglandins may play a part in the antihypertensive action of Ang II antagonists. From a practical standpoint, hypertensive patients treated with valsartan or with lisinopril should be monitored to detect changes in blood pressure control while receiving indomethacin.
The nephrotoxic potentials of the new aminoglycoside SCH 21420 and amikacin were compared in a rat model. Groups of rats received 100, 200, 300, or 600 mg of either drug per kg per day for 14 days. Enzymuria, urine osmolality, protein excretion, and blood urea nitrogen were monitored at periodic intervals, whereas creatinine clearance and pathological changes were determined at sacrifice. Amikacin caused more enzymuria at the two lower doses as well as greater proteinuria and blood urea nitrogen elevations at the highest dose than did SCH 21420 (P less than 0.05). Pathological changes were more severe with amikacin than with SCH 21420 at the three lower doses (P less than 0.05); however, at the 600 mg/kg per day dose, the pathological scores and creatinine clearances of animals receiving either drug were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05).
Studies were conducted on oryzalin (3,5-dinitro-N,N-di(n-propyl)sulfanilamide), a widely used dinitroaniline sulfonamide herbicide, which was identified from plant extracts as an inhibitor of mitogen- and growth factor-mediated intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) signalling in mammalian cells.
Oryzalin inhibited vasopressin, bradykinin and platelet-derived growth factor [Ca2+]i signalling in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with IC50 values of 14, 16 and 18 microM, respectively. 45Ca2+ uptake into nonmitochondrial stores of saponin-permeabilized Swiss 3T3 cells was inhibited by oryzalin with an IC50 of 34 microM. Oryzalin inhibited colony formation of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells with an IC50 of 8 microM and inhibited the growth of a number of other cancer cell lines and primary human tumors in vitro with IC50 values in the range 3 to 22 microM. A number of oryzalin analogues were studied and an association was found between the ability to inhibit [Ca2+]i signalling and inhibition of the growth of HT-29 human colon cancer cells (P = 0.001) and of CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells (P = 0.016). Oryzalin at doses up to 600 mg/kg administered orally or subcutaneously daily to mice for 3 to 10 days beginning a day after tumor inoculation inhibited the growth of murine B16 melanoma by 63% but showed no appreciable activity when administered subcutaneously or intraperitoneally to mice beginning a number of days after tumor inoculation against a variety of human tumor xenografts. The peak plasma concentration of oryzalin following repeated subcutaneous administration of oryzalin at 600 mg/kg per day to mice was 37 microM and of its major metabolite N-depropyl oryzalin was 53 microM.
It is unlikely that the absence of significant antitumor activity of oryzalin is a result of the inability to achieve adequate plasma concentrations.
Forty patients with measurable disseminated malignant melanoma and no prior chemotherapy received monthly DHAC, 5 g/m2/24 h, as a continuous infusion. Among 26 "good risk patients" (ECOG performance score 0, 1 and no prior biological therapy), we observed 3 objective regressions. Among 14 "poor-risk patients" (ECOG PS 2 or prior biological therapy), we observed no objective regressions. For all patients, median time to progression and survival were 1 month and 6.7 months, respectively. Transient pleuritic chest pain and mild nausea and vomiting were the most common complications. We were especially impressed with a complete response (CR) for 11+ months in a 43-year-old woman with extensive visceral metastases and another CR lasting > 4.7 months in a 36-year-old woman with nonvisceral metastatic disease. The absence of myelosuppression raises intriguing possibilities for combination regimens including DHAC in the management of malignant melanoma.
In Uruguay, cocaine base paste (CBP, pasta base) is a widely used form of cocaine. The aim of our study is to determine the main clinical characteristics of CBP abusers.
Retrospective, single-center study of consultations at the Montevideo Poison Control Center between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005.
One hundred and thirteen consultations were included, with an average age of 22 years (+ - 0.5 years) and a female-male sex ratio of 1:4.3. The consultations were related to drug overdose (77%), suicide attempt (16.8%), and wanting to give up CBP use (6.2%). In 48.1% the time elapsed since inhalation of CBP was less than 6 hours. Doses varied between 0.5 gr. and 25 gr. Use of other drugs at the same time, such as alcohol, marijuana or benzodiazepines, was common (51 cases). The symptoms most frequently observed were neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular, followed by respiratory symptoms. In 16.8% of patients, reason for the consultation was intentional acute ingestion of drugs, considered as a suicide attempt, occurring within a few hours of drug consumption.
CBP users are mostly young males. Although clinical findings are compatible with those for cocaine abuse, euphoria is a major clinical feature in CBP abusers. The presence of respiratory symptoms reflects the complications associated with the ingestion route. Suicide attempts occurring within a few hours of CBP confirm the high prevalence of suicidal ideation reported by other authors. cocaine base paste, clinical features, suicide attempts.
Treatment with the new calcium antagonist isradipine significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg in 64% of fourteen blacks with mild or moderately severe essential hypertension. There was a significant reduction in the echocardiographic measures of left ventricular wall thickness and mass in these patients. There was also an increase in fractional left ventricular mass index, shortening and ejection fraction per 100 g left ventricular mass and no indication in mean circumferential shortening. There was another indication of improved left ventricular performance. With the reduced left ventricular mass and diastolic blood pressure, there was a reduction in the ratio of peak systolic wall stress to fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass. There was a significant relationship between peak systolic wall stress and fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass index. The directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg. Isradipine monotherapy was an effective antihypertensive drug in blacks with essential hypertension, resulting in regression of left ventricular wall thickness and mass and augmentation of fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass.
Investigators tested the hypothesis that administration of the NMDA antagonist ketamine would result in differential effects on activity levels in rats depending upon the age and the sex of the animal. Twenty-two-, 35-, and 50-day-old rats were given doses of ketamine (0.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) and tested for open-field activity and frequencies of reverse locomotion, rearing, turning, and head weaving. Results indicated that ketamine produced hyperactivity in both males and females at 22 days of age but only in females at 35 days of age. There was no effect of ketamine on locomotor activity in 50-day-old rats, regardless of sex. Effects of ketamine on turning, reverse locomotion, and head weaving were similar with administration, in general, causing increments in these behaviors in both sexes at 22 days and in females at all ages tested. Ketamine resulted in reductions in rearing in both sexes regardless of age.
ASC (Antidepressant-Sensitive Catalepsy) mice, bred for a high predisposition to catalepsy, are characterized by depression-like behavior and decreased immune responses. Chronic administration of fluoxetine, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant widely used in clinical practice, to mice of this strain weakened catalepsy and normalized the number of rosette-forming cells in the spleen. In mice of the parental cataleptic strain CBA/Lac, fluoxetine had no effect on the level of catalepsy or the immune response. Analysis of the effects of fluoxetine on the functional activity of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors, and the expression of 5-HT(1A) receptor genes in the frontal cortex and midbrain and 5-HT(2A) receptors in the frontal cortex, as well as the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 and the serotonin transporter genes in the midbrain showed that the antidepressant had no effect on these parameters in ASC mice, but decreased the functional activity of 5-HT(2A) receptors in CBA/Lac mice. The possibility that the actions of fluoxetine on catalepsy and the immune response in mice with depression-like states are mediated via other serotoninergic mechanisms is discussed.
A healthy 3-year-old boy presented to our emergency department with sudden onset of abnormal movement. This patient had been treated for 2 days with conventional doses of an antihistamine/decongestant cold preparation for upper respiratory infection symptoms. The child was confused and restless, with posturing of limbs. Cranial nerve function was intact. Gastric lavage yielded an aspirate the same color as the cold syrup the child had ingested. A diagnosis of dystonic reaction was made, and the child was treated with benztropine, which effected resolution of his symptoms. This is the first reported case in the literature of dystonia induced by an antihistamine and treated with benztropine.
In the present study, we first investigated the effects of unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioning of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) on the expression of subunits of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP channels) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum and hippocampus of adult rats by utilizing semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry techniques. The results show that Kir6.2 and SUR2 expression in the PFC, Kir6.1, Kir6.2 and SUR1 expression in the striatum, and Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 expression in the hippocampus of injured side increased significantly after unilateral 6-OHDA lesioning of the SNc in rats. Afterward, we studied the effects of iptakalim (Ipt), a novel ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener (KCO), on parkinsonian symptoms, which were induced by acute injection of haloperidol. The results indicate that intraperitoneal injection of Ipt (0.125 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg) partially alleviated haloperidol-induced catalepsy and hypolocomotion. Even though the observed effects (0.5 mg/kg) are better than those of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) (100 mg/kg), Ipt (0.25 mg/kg) failed to enhance the anti-parkinsonian actions of L-DOPA (100 mg/kg). Our results suggest that KATP channels might be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced in an animal model and conceptually support the idea that KATP channels may be new therapeutic targets for PD.
The present study reports that it is possible to induce kindling by repeated injections of nicotine. The newly characterised nicotine-kindling model was compared with that of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling. Mice were kindled by repeated injection of PTZ (37 mg/kg), or nicotine (2.3 mg/kg), and the effect of the anti-epileptic drugs (AED) levetiracetam (LEV), tiagabine (TGB) and phenytoin (PHT) on seizures in kindled and naive mice were investigated. C-Fos immunoreactivity (Fos IR) was used to investigate differences in neuronal activity pattern between PTZ-, nicotine kindled and naive animals. PTZ kindled animals mainly showed increased Fos IR in limbic regions, whereas Fos IR in nicotine kindled animals was increased in the entorhinal cortex, medial habenula and the compact part of substantia nigra. Fully kindled PTZ-induced seizures were inhibited by LEV (ED50=13.6+/-7.8 mg/kg), TGB (ED50=0.3+/-0.04 mg/kg) but not PHT (ED50>40 mg/kg) whereas fully kindled nicotine-induced seizures were inhibited by LEV (ED50=1.4+/-0.4 mg/kg), TGB (ED50=0.3+/-0.06 mg/kg) and PHT (ED50=9.2+/-2.4 mg/kg). These differences in efficacy of AEDs were not due to changes in plasma levels in the various models. In conclusion, repeated administration of nicotine can induce a kindling-like phenomenon and the model showed significantly different Fos IR pattern and pharmacology to that of PTZ kindling.
In utero and lactational exposure to a single maternal dose of 1 microg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)/kg causes some overt toxicity and impairs prostate growth in male offspring. As similar effects on the ventral prostate can be caused by decreased testosterone production during perinatal development, we determined whether intratesticular testosterone content, testicular responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation, or plasma testosterone concentrations were reduced in fetal and newborn rats. Because these endpoints were not affected, the ability of TCDD exposure to inhibit synthesis of the proximal androgen in prostate development, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), from the circulating precursor testosterone and 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17ss-diol (3alpha-Diol), was studied on postnatal days (PNDs) 14, 21, and 32. The ability of the ventral prostate to form DHT from 3alpha-Diol was slightly impaired on PND 14, but this transient effect was not statistically significant, and recovery was evident by PND 21. Subsequent experiments used organ culture to study the effects of in vivo TCDD exposure on androgen metabolism, androgen responsiveness, androgen receptor expression, and luminal epithelial cell differentiation after in vitro exposure to graded androgen concentrations. In utero and lactational TCDD exposure had no effect on DHT formation in organ culture, but transiently reduced the androgen -induced expression of prostatic-binding protein subunit C3, decreased ventral prostate epithelial cell androgen receptor expression, and inhibited the formation of androgen responsive luminal epithelial cells. These results suggest that TCDD exposure impairs prostate growth and androgen responsiveness by inhibiting prostatic epithelial cell differentiation.
To evaluate the safety of lidocaine in the setting of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction (MI).
A retrospective, multicenter study.
Twenty-nine university, university-affiliated, or community hospitals during a 6-year period (total of 117 cumulative hospital-years).
Patients with cocaine-associated MI who received lidocaine in the emergency department.
Of 29 patients who received lidocaine in the setting of cocaine-associated MI, no patient died; exhibited bradydysrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation; or experienced seizures after administration of lidocaine (95% confidence interval, 0% to 11%).
Despite theoretical concerns that lidocaine may enhance cocaine toxicity, the use of lidocaine in patients with cocaine-associated MI was not associated with significant cardiovascular or central nervous system toxicity.
While the health of the general population is not adversely affected by the exposure the pesticides in food and environment, workers, who have during their occupation been intensely exposed to pesticides, exhibit a higher prevalence of slight neurotoxic symptoms. In the present study the electroencephalograms of 3 of a group 10 workmen, who had been continually exposed to hexachlorcyclohexane, show pathological findings. The electromyograms of 8 of these 10 workman demonstrate a disturbance of the peripherical motoneuron. All probands, who exhibit o pathological EEG, also show a polyneuropathy.
We report 10 heterozygous mutations in the human insulin gene in 16 probands with neonatal diabetes. A combination of linkage and a candidate gene approach in a family with four diabetic members led to the identification of the initial INS gene mutation. The mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in this and two other small families whereas the mutations in the other 13 patients are de novo. Diabetes presented in probands at a median age of 9 weeks, usually with diabetic ketoacidosis or marked hyperglycemia, was not associated with beta cell autoantibodies, and was treated from diagnosis with insulin. The mutations are in critical regions of the preproinsulin molecule, and we predict that they prevent normal folding and progression of proinsulin in the insulin secretory pathway. The abnormally folded proinsulin molecule may induce the unfolded protein response and undergo degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and potentially beta cell death by apoptosis. This process has been described in both the Akita and Munich mouse models that have dominant-acting missense mutations in the Ins2 gene, leading to loss of beta cell function and mass. One of the human mutations we report here is identical to that in the Akita mouse. The identification of insulin mutations as a cause of neonatal diabetes will facilitate the diagnosis and possibly, in time, treatment of this disorder.
We studied the effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on the classical behavioral test of scopolamine-induced amnesia for a passive avoidance response in the mouse. Pre-training intraperitoneal administration of this cytokine (1.25, 2.5, 5.0 or 10 micrograms/mouse) partially, although significantly, reduced the amnesic action of the muscarinic receptor antagonist. The peripheral administration of a specific interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 ra, 50 micrograms/mouse i.p.) blocked the effect of GM-CSF. Our results suggest that GM-CSF is able to exert neuromodulatory actions and that it is involved (probably via IL-1) in the interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system.
Hyperprolactinemia is an important but neglected adverse effect of antipsychotic medication. All first generation antipsychotics and the second generation antipsychotics amisulpride and risperidone have been shown to cause marked elevation in serum prolactin levels, whereas most other second generation antipsychotics and aripiprazole appear to have little or no effect on serum prolactin levels. This study was aimed to assess the time course of changes in antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia during the process of antipsychotic switching to aripiprazole. Twenty-three female schizophrenic subjects with risperidone- or sulpiride-induced symptomatic hyperprolactinemia were recruited into the study and 20 of them completed the trial. We added aripiprazole to the therapeutic dose first, then overlapped the preexisting antipsychotic treatment and aripiprazole, and finally tapered the preexisting antipsychotic treatment. Clinical status was assessed by using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S). Assessment scales and serum prolactin levels were measured at baseline, during the combination treatment period, and four weeks after having completed discontinuation of the preexisting antipsychotic treatment. Switching antipsychotic drugs to aripiprazole was effective in reducing serum prolactin levels and restoring menstruation in schizophrenic patients who received prolactin-raising antipsychotics. Mean serum prolactin levels at baseline, during combination period, and after the switch were 97.0+/-69.0 ng/ml, 27.2+/-10.6 ng/ml (p<0.001, vs. baseline), and 12.2+/-5.3 ng/ml (p<0.001, vs. baseline), respectively. None of the study subjects experienced any serious adverse effects during the switching process. No significant changes were noted in the PANSS and CGI-S scores during the switching process. The prolactin-normalizing effects of aripiprazole are likely caused by the unique characteristics of the dopamine partial agonist with its high affinity for dopamine D2 receptors.
Serum cortisol, prolactin (PRL), TSH, GH, LH and FSH levels were measured before and immediately after daily ACTH-Z therapy (0.01 mg/kg/day, 1-2 weeks) for 5 patients with infantile spasms and one patient with myoclonus epilepsy. Total number of ACTH-Z therapy were 8 times, and all patients became seizure free after ACTH-Z therapy. In 6 occasions, TRH, LH-RH and insulin tolerance tests were performed before and after daily ACTH-Z therapy. Serum cortisol levels were significantly increased after daily ACTH-Z therapy but all other hormone levels were significantly decreased. In TRH and LH-RH tolerance tests, peak levels and increments of PRL, LH and FSH were significantly decreased after daily ACTH-Z therapy and those of TSH were mildly decreased. In one case insulin tolerance test revealed an adequate decrease of blood glucose before and after ACTH-Z therapy, and there was a poor GH response after ACTH-Z therapy. Daily ACTH-Z therapy was thought to suppress secretion of anterior pituitary hormones.
Bacopa monniera is well known herbal medicine for its neuropharmacological effects. It alleviates variety of disorders including neuronal and physiological changes. Crackers smoke is a potent risk factor that leads to free radical mediated oxidative stress in vivo. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the protective efficacy of B. monniera extract (BME) against crackers smoke induced neuronal and physiological changes via modulating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in rats. Rats were exposed to smoke for 1h for a period of 3 weeks and consecutively treated with BME at three different dosages (i.e., 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg b.wt.). Our results elucidate that BME treatment ameliorates histopathalogical changes, reactive oxygen species levels, lipid peroxidation, acetylcholine esterase activity and brain neurotransmitter levels to normal. BME supplementation efficiently inhibited HO-1 expression and nitric oxide generation by down-regulating iNOS expression. Smoke induced depletion of antioxidant enzyme status, monoamine oxidase activity was also replenished by BME supplementation. Thus the present study indicates that BME ameliorates various impairments associated with neuronal and physiological changes in rats exposed to crackers smoke by its potent neuromodulatory, antioxidant and adaptogenic propensity.
WJ1376-1 and WJ1398-1 are new synthetic compounds developed based on the structure of the Chinese herbal medicine osthole. Previously, we reported that WJ1376-1 and WJ1398-1 can induce cell-cycle arrest by activating ATR kinase (ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related kinase) and inhibiting the phosphorylation of Aurora A kinase. In this study, we determined that WJ1376-1 and WJ1398-1 strongly inhibited the migration and invasion in human colorectal cancer cells at concentrations as low as 1μM. In the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition model, WJ1376-1 and WJ1398-1 potently downregulated the transcription factor Snail1, the mesenchymal protein vimentin, and matrix metalloprotease-9, but upregulated the epithelial protein E-cadherin. WJ1376-1 and WJ1398-1 also inhibited the TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and of Akt at Ser 473, and the nuclear translocation of Smad2 was substantially lower in WJ1376-1- and WJ1398-1-treated cells than it was in control cells. In transient transfection experiments, we observed that WJ1376-1 and WJ1398-1 strongly inhibited TGF-β-stimulated activity of a Smad reporter. Finally, WJ1376-1 and WJ1398-1 blocked TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of the TGF-β Type I receptor (TGF-βRI). These results suggest that WJ1376-1 and WJ1398-1 inhibit cell migration and invasion by suppressing TGF-βRI phosphorylation and subsequently hindering both Smad2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways.
Oxaliplatin is used in the chemotherapeutic treatment of malignant tumours. A common side effect of oxaliplatin is an acute peripheral neuropathy characterized by axonal hyperexcitability, which can be painful and is aggravated by exposure to cold. Electrophysiological studies on isolated segments of peripheral rodent nerve have been able to replicate oxaliplatin's effect on axonal hyperexcitability in vitro. In the present study we have used this in vitro model to examine whether flupirtine, a clinically available analgesic, which activates slow axonal potassium (Kv7) channels, can suppress axonal hyperexcitability resulting from exposure of peripheral nerve to oxaliplatin. In the presence of oxaliplatin (30μM), the A-fibre compound action potential response of isolated rat nerve segments to a brief electrical stimulus (0.1ms) changed considerably with the emergence of after-activity that persisted for a period of tens of milliseconds after the electrical stimulus. Lowering the bath temperature by 4°C enhanced the magnitude and prolonged the time course of this axonal after-activity. Application of flupirtine (10μM) reduced both the magnitude and duration of oxaliplatin-induced axonal after-activity in myelinated axons. These findings were also confirmed in isolated human sural nerve segments. The data indicate that activation of slow potassium channels in the A-fibres of peripheral nerve may attenuate the acute neuropathy associated with oxaliplatin in humans.
To determine whether warming of lidocaine decreases the pain of its injection during digital nerve block.
Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.
Twenty healthy volunteers received bilateral digital nerve blocks of their middle finger. They were first randomly assigned to receive either room-temperature (21 degrees C) or heated (42 degrees C) 2% lidocaine in their first block. They were then randomly assigned to receive the first block in either the right or left hand. The blocks were performed in a standardized fashion by a single physician, who was blinded to which solution was being used. The volunteers rated the pain of each digital block on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Efficacy of each digital block was tested at 5 minutes.
Heating of the lidocaine was associated with a significantly lower median VAS pain score (31.5 versus 25.0; P < .05). There was no difference in pain score between the two solutions in relation to which hand was used (P = .29) or whether the injection was the first or the second (P = .37). When all factors (temperature, order, and hand) were considered in the ANOVA with respect to VAS pain score, the only significant relation found was that between the temperature of the solution and the VAS pain score (P = .028).
Heating of lidocaine decreases the pain of injection during digital nerve block.
Rupture of Achilles tendon (AT) is an uncommon complication of treatment with fluoroquinolones. We describe a case of bilateral tendinosis and rupture of the right AT in a patient who began levofloxacin treatment for community acquired pneumonia. Sonography showed thickening and hypoecogenicity of both AT and complete rupture and separation of the right Achilles tendon.
