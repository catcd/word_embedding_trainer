Cocaine-induced paranoia (CIP) remains an important drug-induced model of idiopathic paranoia for which no psychophysiologic marker has yet emerged. Measures of pupillary oscillation were able to significantly distinguish a group of abstinent crack cocaine abusers endorsing past CIP (n = 32) from another group of crack addicts who denied past CIP (n = 29).
Seven patients with refractory seizure disorders and neuropsychiatric symptoms believed secondary to felbamate are presented. Five were on concomitant valproic acid (and other agents). Anergia, apathy, bradyphrenia, and increased irritability were prominent. One patient on felbamate monotherapy had a new-onset psychosis. Felbamate's NMDA receptor antagonism and GABA potentiation (perhaps enhanced by valproic acid use) are discussed as possible mechanisms of these side effects.
Obsessive compulsive (OC) symptoms following methylphenidate (MPH) administration are seldom reported and usually not even mentioned among its adverse effects. We report here a case of MPH-induced OC symptoms which began ten months after the treatment was initiated and that were exacerbated 14 months later. This delay and the symptoms fluctuations might lead out of the right diagnostic though tic occurrence could then correct. Cross-sensitization between stress and psychostimulants might as well explain the long delayed onset of obsessive compulsive symptoms as their fluctuation both along time and contexts.
Nicotine-containing patches are used to facilitate tobacco withdrawal by mitigating abstinence symptoms and diminishing craving. We describe two patients who developed vasculitis in association with the use of a nicotine patch. The first concerns a patient who developed fever, arthritis, a generalized erythema and purpuric lesions, after 3 days use of nicotine patches. Laboratory results and a skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a leucocytoclastic vasculitis. After stopping use of the patch, the patient recovered. On challenge, the symptoms reappeared. The second patient developed purpuric lesions during the use of nicotine patches, and recovered fully after these were stopped. In these patients, nicotine patches seem to be causally related to the development of vasculitis.
The case of a 43-year-old Taiwanese man who presented with spinal epidural hematoma following intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) and heparin therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is reported. Upper back pain and progressive neurological dysfunction ensued, secondary to spinal epidural hematoma with spinal cord compression. The patient did not recover neurologic function postsurgically, possibly because the operation was delayed. In conclusion, cardiologists should be alert to this rare, severe complication of rTPA and should perform early laminectomy (in < or = 36 hours for those with complete deficit and in < or = 48 hours for those with incomplete deficit) if possible.
Cocaine is a common drug. Myocardial infarcts and brain infarcts related to the use of cocaine were previously reported in the medical literature. We report a 34 year old patient admitted for severe chest pain, a few minutes after cocaine use. He was found to have an acute myocardial infarction with significant left ventricle dysfunction. Coronarography conducted a few days later was found to be normal. Cocaine use may cause acute myocardial infarction in young and healthy people with no other risk factors.
The effect of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the progression of chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis was examined. Rats were injected with 15 mg/100 gm body weight PAN and 5 mg/100 gm body weight, on weeks - 1 and 5, respectively. A third group was injected with an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline, intraperitoneally (Group III) on week - 1 and 5. Beginning week 0, group I received 50 mg/kg captopril daily in the drinking water for 12 weeks. Group II received no treatment. Captopril failed to attenuate the peak level of proteinuria induced by the first injection of PAN or to alter the rate of decline of proteinuria when begun 1 week after the PAN injection. However, captopril did blunt the increase in urinary protein excretion following the second injection of PAN (p less than 0.05). Group II became hypertensive compared to Group I on week 8 and 12 and Group III on week 12 (p less than 0.05). Group I and II could not be distinguished on the basis of renal histologic rank (p = 0.80). We conclude that captopril affords some protection against the development of PAN-induced proteinuria, but it does not accelerate the recovery phase when glomerular permselectivity is being regained.
In order to investigate the effects of lead exposure on lipid metabolism, rats were exposed to 200, 300 and 400 ppm lead in their drinking water for 12 weeks. The lead exposure resulted in induction of phospholipidosis in kidney and brain of the animals. While renal phospholipidosis was accompanied with depletion of renal cholesterol, phospholipidosis in the brain was accompanied with enhanced cholesterogenesis and hypertriglyceridemia. Lead exposure also resulted in enhanced hepatic cholesterogenesis and this was accompanied with a decrease in triglyceride and phospholipid contents. While lead exposure did not affect erythrocyte phospholipids, there was a 37% increase in erythrocyte cholesterol in animals exposed to the 200 ppm lead dose. In the plasma, lead exposure resulted in a dose-dependent increase in free fatty acid concentration. Although phospholipids also decreased in the plasma as a result of lead exposure, the decrease was not dose-dependent. Lead exposure did not affect plasma and HDL cholesterol and triglyceride. A double fold increase in cholesterol/phospholipid ratio was observed in the brain of lead-exposed animals, whereas this ratio decreased in the kidney. Positive associations were observed between tissue cholesterol and phospholipids versus lead accumulation in blood, liver and kidney. In contrast however, negative associations were observed between tissue triglyceride and lead accumulation in liver and kidney. Our results suggest that induction of cholesterogenesis and phospholipidosis in tissues may be responsible for the subtle and insidious cellular effects of lead and that these cellular events may mediate the hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic and neurotoxic manifestations in lead intoxication.
We report a case of possible bupivacaine toxicity after intraarticular injection during knee arthroscopy. The importance of the specific type of surgical procedure performed during arthroscopy and its relationship to potential local anesthetic toxicity are highlighted.
Verapamil (Ver), an inhibitor of the multidrug resistance gene product, has been proved to be a promising combination partner with other anti-cancer agents including proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Gambogic acid (GA) has been approved for Phase II clinical trials in cancer therapy in China. We have most recently reported that GA is a potent proteasome inhibitor, with anticancer efficiency comparable to bortezomib but much less toxicity. In the current study we investigated whether Ver can enhance the cytotoxicity of GA. We report that (i) the combination of Ver and GA results in synergistic cytotoxic effect and cell death induction in HepG2 and K562 cancer cell lines; (ii) a combinational treatment with Ver and GA induces caspase activation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; (iii) caspase inhibitor z-VAD blocks GA+Ver-induced apoptosis but not proteasome inhibition; (iv) cysteine-containing compound N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevents GA+Ver-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and proteasome inhibition. These results demonstrate that Ver accelerates GA-induced cytotoxicity via enhancing proteasome inhibition and ROS production. These findings indicate that the natural product GA is a valuable candidate that can be used in combination with Ver, thus representing a compelling anticancer strategy.
To evaluate the potential of photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid (ALA-PDT) for ablation of endometrial explants in a rat endometriosis model and to compare the effect of ALA-PDT, electrosurgery, and surgical resection on normal peritoneum.
Prospective controlled experimental trial.
University medical center.
Mature Sprague-Dawley female rats.
Induction of endometriosis and subsequent treatment with ALA-PDT; electrosurgery, and simple resection, and ALA-PDT of normal peritoneum.
Histopathological assessment.
Systemic ALA followed by exposure to photoactivating light for 10 or 15 minutes resulted in ablation of all explants harvested 3-4 days after treatment. Permanent destruction was confirmed by absence of regrowth by week 3. Exposure of normal peritoneum to ALA-PDT resulted in initial necrosis, with complete recovery by day 16. Adhesions were present on day 16 in 50% of cases after electrosurgery and in 100% of cases after resection. No adhesions were present in ALA-PDT-treated animals.
Systemic ALA followed by exposure to photoactivating light at relatively low power densities for periods as brief as 10 minutes resulted in ablation of endometriotic explants. Exposure of normal peritoneum to ALA-PDT resulted in complete resurfacing. Both electrosurgery and surgical resection resulted in a greater incidence of surface adhesions.
Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) has been shown to play a key role in the pathophysiology of itch. However, the precise mechanism of PAR2-mediated itch remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of several agents on the scratching behavior induced by PAR2-activating peptide (SLIGRL-NH2). Pretreatment of experimental animals with tacrolimus or the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton significantly reduced SLIGRL-NH2-induced scratching behavior, whereas histamine H(1) receptor antagonist cetirizine or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had little effect. Furthermore, intradermal injection of SLIGRL-NH2 increased cutaneous levels of LTB(4) and PGE(2). In vitro, SLIGRL-NH2 treatment enhanced LTB(4) and PGE(2) release from primary keratinocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. Preincubation of keratinocytes with zileuton resulted in a significant decrease of LTB(4) release and treatment of indomethacin led to a significant decrease of PGE(2) in response to SLIGRL-NH2 stimulation. In addition, SLIGRL-NH2-induced secretion of LTB(4) and PGE(2) was significantly inhibited by tacrolimus, whereas cetirizine had no effect. These results indicate that SLIGRL-NH2 stimulates LTB(4) and PGE(2) release from mouse keratinocytes and that enhancement of LTB(4) and PGE(2) secretion contributes to SLIGRL-NH2-induced scratching behavior in ICR mice.
There have been many studies using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and opioids for postoperative analgesia in children. In this study, we investigated the efficacy, usefulness and analgesic consumption of two different PCA programmes [bolus dose alone (BD) or bolus dose with background infusion (BD + BI)] to evaluate postoperative analgesia for children after emergency appendicectomy.
Forty children, aged between 6 and 15 years and ASA class I or II, undergoing emergency appendicectomy were randomly allocated into two groups. The children were given a loading dose of pethidine 0.3 mg.kg-1 and 150 micro g.kg-1 bolus intravenously in group BD (n = 20) and pethidine 0.3 mg.kg-1 loading dose, 75 micro g.kg-1 bolus and 15 micro g.kg-1.h-1 background infusion in group BD + BI (n = 20). The lockout interval was 20 min in both groups.
There were no significant differences in pain, sedation and nausea scores during the 24-h postoperative period between the groups (P > 0.05). Pethidine consumption was significantly lower in group BD + BI than that in group BD for the first 24-h period (P < 0.05).
We demonstrated that both these PCA programmes were effective and reliable for postoperative pain relief in children. We believe that giving information about PCA to the children and their parents is useful during the preoperative period. However, the background infusion with lower bolus dose in PCA did not increase pethidine consumption.
Ketamine has an opioid sparing effect following surgery in adults. This study investigated whether a similar effect is seen following appendicectomy in paediatric patients.
Seventy-five ASA 1 or 2 children aged 7-16 years were recruited, and randomly allocated to one of three groups. Following a standard anaesthetic for appendicectomy, all were prescribed patient controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine with paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) as required for postoperative analgesia. In addition the control group received a saline infusion postoperatively, the ketamine bolus group received 500 micro g.kg-1 intravenous (i.v.) ketamine preincision and a saline infusion postoperatively, and the ketamine infusion group received 500 micro g.kg-1 i.v. ketamine preincision and a ketamine infusion at 4 micro g.kg-1 min-1 postoperatively. Morphine consumption, rescue analgesia requirement and side-effects were recorded postoperatively.
There was no difference in morphine consumption between the groups. The ketamine infusion group required more doses of rescue analgesia and reported more side-effects than the control group. Five patients, all in the ketamine infusion group, reported hallucinations.
In this paediatric population intravenous ketamine did not have a morphine sparing effect. The increased incidence of side-effects, especially hallucinations, reported by patients given a ketamine infusion may limit the further use of postoperative ketamine in children.
Eighty-seven per cent of surgical patients receiving undiluted diazepam experienced pain on injection while 6-16%, depending on the dose, manifested evidence of clinical thrombophlebitis. This was improved when diazepam, 10 mg, was diluted to 20-40 ml with intravenous solution. In contrast, lorazepam appeared to have minimal irritative or injurious effects on veins whether undiluted or diluted. In view of these results and clinical studies reporting a higher patient acceptance of lorazepam than diazepam, lorazepam may be a superior drug for use in anaesthesia.
Adipose tissues serve not only as a store for energy in the form of lipid, but also as endocrine tissues that regulates metabolic activities of the organism by secreting various kinds of hormones. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation that induces the expression of adipocyte-specific genes in preadipocytes and mediates their differentiation into adipocytes. Furthermore, PPARgamma has an important role to maintain the physiological function of mature adipocyte by controlling expressions of various genes properly. Therefore, any reduction in amount and activity of PPARgamma is linked to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.
In this study, we investigated the contribution of epigenetic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, to the expression of the PPARgamma gene, and further evaluated the contribution of such epigenetic regulatory mechanisms to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the promoter of the PPARgamma2 gene was hypermethylated, but was progressively demethylated upon induction of differentiation, which was accompanied by an increase of mRNA expression. Moreover, treatment of cells with 5'-aza-cytideine, an inhibitor of DNA methylation, increased expression of the PPARgamma gene in a dose-dependent manner. Methylation in vitro of a PPARgamma promoter-driven reporter construct also repressed the transcription of a downstream reporter gene. These results suggest that the expression of the PPARgamma gene is inhibited by methylation of its promoter. We next compared the methylation status of the PPARgamma promoters in adipocytes from wild-type (WT) mice with those from two diabetic mouse models: +Leprdb/+Leprdb and diet-induced obesity mice. Interestingly, we found increased methylation of the PPARgamma promoter in visceral adipose tissues (VAT) of the mouse models of diabetes, compared to that observed in wild-type mice. We observed a concomitant decrease in the level of PPARgamma mRNA in the diabetic mice compared to the WT mice.
We conclude that the expression of PPARgamma gene is regulated by DNA methylation of its promoter region and propose that reduced expression of PPARgamma owing to DNA methylation in adipocytes of the VAT may contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.
The heme oxygenase system (HO-1 and HO-2) catalyzes the conversion of heme to free iron, carbon monoxide (CO), a vasodepressor, and biliverdin, which is further converted to bilirubin, an antioxidant. HO-1 induction has been shown to suppress arachidonic acid metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) monooxygenases and cyclooxygenases (COX), and to decrease blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The Goldblatt 2K1C model is a model of renovascular hypertension in which there is increased expression of COX-2 in the macula densa and increased renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the clipped kidney. We examined whether HO-1 overexpression, as a prophylactic approach, would attenuate renovascular hypertension and evaluated potential mechanisms that may account for its effect.
2K1C rats were treated with cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) or tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP) one day before surgery and weekly for three weeks thereafter. We measured systolic blood pressure, HO activity, HO-1, HO-2, COX-1 and COX-2 protein expression, heme content, and nitrotyrosine levels as indices of oxidative stress. Urinary prostaglandin excretion (PGE2), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone levels were also measured.
CoPP administration induced renal HO-1 expression by 20-fold and HO activity by 6-fold. This was associated with a reduction in heme content, nitrotyrosine levels, COX-2 expression and urinary PGE2 excretion, and attenuation of the development of hypertension in the 2K1C rats. There was no decrease in plasma renin activity; however, plasma aldosterone levels were significantly lower. In the 2K1C SnMP-treated rats, blood pressure was significantly higher than that of untreated 2K1C rats throughout the study, and the difference in the size of the smaller left clipped kidney compared to the nonclipped right kidney was significantly increased.
These findings define an action of prolonged HO-1 induction to interrupt and counteract the influence of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to increase in blood pressure in the 2K1C model of renovascular hypertension. Multiple mechanisms include a decrease in oxidative stress as indicated by the decrease in cellular heme and nitrotyrosine levels, an anti-inflammatory action as evidenced by a decrease in COX-2 and PGE2, interference with the action of angiontensin II (Ang II) as evidenced by an increase in PRA in the face of a decrease in PGE2 and aldosterone, as well as the inhibition of aldosterone synthesis.
The frequency and severity of clinical and subclinical heart damage were studied in patients who had been treated with adriamycin (ADR) as part of the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Studies (COSS). The study charts of 785 patients from 63 participating institutions were reviewed: The overall incidence of drug-induced congestive heart failure was 2.2% (17 cases, 5 fatal). Late left ventricular function was studied in 29 tumor free survivors 81 +/- 41 month after treatment with 342 +/- 113 mg/m2 ADR. A detailed history and physical exam for signs of overt heart disease were obtained. M-mode echocardiography (ECHO, 29 cases) with evaluation of the fractional shortening rate (FS) and radionuclide ventriculography (RNV, 18 cases) with determination of the systolic ejection fraction at rest (EF) were used to screen for subclinical cardiac disease. Impaired cardiac function leading to pathological values was documented in close to one half of these patients. The frequency and severity of clinical and subclinical heart damage increased with cumulative adriamycin and time since cessation of anthracycline therapy.
In order to detect changes in cardiac function, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and radiologic studies were performed in 71 patients (age 1-26 yrs) who had been treated at the University Children's Hospital Berlin because of malignant diseases according to protocols of the DAL/GPO and had received anthracyclines (doxorubicin or daunorubicin) at cumulative doses up to 480 mg/m2 (median 280 mg/m2). Clinically overt cardiomyopathy was observed in one girl and required transient administration of digoxin. In 2 patients echocardiographic changes led to a reduction of the scheduled anthracycline doses. No patient died from congestive heart failure. During treatment, an increase in the cardiothoracic index was observed in 14 children, and in 16 the ECG showed pathological findings. A decrease in contractility to 25% or less as detected by ultrasound was seen in 15 patients. More than 50% of patients developed echocardiographical signs indicating an impairment of myocardial function. However, persistent changes were only found in 1 patient after discontinuation of treatment. Long-term echocardiographic follow-up studies for 4-48 months (median 14 months) after completion of anthracycline therapy were performed in 18 patients and the findings compared to matched-pair controls. The observed M-mode parameters were completely normal, and the ejection fractions calculated from the two-dimensional ultrasound investigations were in the normal range but slightly diminished compared to controls. Cardiac ultrasound is a non-invasive, reproducible and tolerable procedure for early detection of an anthracycline cardiomyopathy. In our patients, time of occurrence and the extent of pathological changes were not associated with the cumulative applied anthracycline doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Abuse of the drugs like amphetamine, cocaine and "Ecstasy" may be complicated by intracerebral, subdural or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Contrary to historical opinion, drug-related intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is frequently related to an underlying vascular malformation. We report the case of an 18-year-old man with a history of Ecstasy abuse preceding the onset of severe occipital headache. Cerebral computed tomography revealed right-sided subarachnoid haemorrhage and cerebral angiography showed right-sided middle cerebral artery aneurysm of 1 cm diameter. The patient was treated surgically with aneurysm clipping. Three weeks after onset of intracranial haemorrhage, neurological examination demonstrated normal findings. A history of severe headache immediately after using amphetamine, Ecstasy, or cocaine should alert doctors to the possibility of intracerebral haemorrhage. Arteriography should be part of the evaluation of most young patients with stroke or non-traumatic ICH.
Cardiac complications are major limiting factors regarding the success of high-dose chemotherapy supported by blood stem cell transplantation (BSCT). The cardiotoxicity of cyclophosphamide remains obscure relative to that of anthracyclines. The aim of this study was to estimate noninvasively the cardiotoxicity of cyclophosphamide administered during the pretransplant conditioning of BSCT for patients with various hematological diseases. A total of 27 consecutive patients were divided into two groups depending on the conditioning regimen, ie, group A (n=15) which received cyclophosphamide (median dose of 120 mg/kg; range 100 to 200 mg/kg) and group B (n=12) which did not. Ultrasound cardiograms (UCG) and signal-averaged electrocardiograms (SAECG) were recorded in the two groups both preceding and following the BSCT. There were no statistical intergroup or intragroup differences in left ventricular (LV) dimensions or contractile function. Significant (P<0.01) posttransplant increases in interventricular septal wall thickness and Ap/Ep ratio were noted in group A. Moreover, the filtered QRS duration as estimated by SAECG was prolonged (P<0.05) whereas the summated LV voltage (S(V1)+R(V5)) was reduced in the posttransplant period only in group A. These results suggest that early cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity was characterized by LV diastolic rather than systolic dysfunction. These findings may contribute to acute hemodynamic deterioration observed after cyclophosphamide-containing conditioning chemotherapy.
