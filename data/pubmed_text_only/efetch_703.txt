Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor widely used in the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. In a 73-year-old man we describe renal failure due to acute interstitial nephritis after use of omeprazol during 4 months. Unexpected renal failure without signs of hydronephrosis should always provoke awareness of drug reaction, omeprazole being one of the possible drugs.
It is known that ophthalmic beta-blockers can induce atrioventricular block. In our series of 243 patients with atrioventricular block, 12 were treated with topic ophthalmic timolol. None of them recognized the eye-drops as a treatment. In 7 cases the sinus rhythm was recovered and in 5 a pacemaker was implanted. There is a significant percentage of atrioventricular blocks produced by the ophthalmic beta-blockers that the patient does not recognize as treatment, and 60% of them are reversible. It is important to ask about the use of eye-drops in patients with bradycardia or atrioventricular block.
Baroreflex sensitivity assessed from the phenylephrine-induced reflex bradycardia was significantly decreased following 5 min global incomplete cerebral ischemia in pentobarbitalized dogs. Although bilateral vagotomy in the cervical region decreased baroreflex sensitivity by about 50% in sham-operated animals, it hardly affected the baroreflex in animals subjected to ischemia. The extent of the decrease in the influence of vagotomy on the baroreflex was dependent on the severity of ischemia in the dorsal medulla oblongata. In animals vagotomized before ischemia, no significant decrease in baroreflex sensitivity was observed following ischemia. Pretreatment with ifenprodil or flunarizine, 1 mg/kg i.v., 5 min prior to ischemia prevented the post-ischemic decrease in baroreflex sensitivity. Vagotomy decreased baroreflex sensitivity during the reperfusion period in these treated animals. These results suggest that the post-ischemic attenuation of reflex bradycardia may be due to a selective dysfunction of the vagal component of baroreflex, which can be prevented by the cerebroprotective agents.
After profound peripheral neurotoxicity during induction chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the index patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy (CMT), study coordinators of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) front-line ALL protocols reviewed patient registrations to identify any other patients with possible CMT. The goal was to provide preliminary information about patients with undiagnosed CMT who develop ALL.
Five children with ALL who were enrolled in POG B-precursor or T-cell ALL protocols from 1994 to 1999 subsequently were determined to have CMT hereditary neuropathy. Their clinical presentations and treatment records were reviewed in detail. Records of all patients entered on POG 9201 (lesser-risk ALL) were reviewed to identify all cases of significant vincristine toxicity noted in the first 6 months of treatment.
The five identified patients all had substantial peripheral neurotoxicity that required alteration in treatment and/or orthopedic/physical therapy evaluation and follow-up. The POG 9201 review identified 25 of 686 patients (3.6%) with significant peripheral neuropathy. Three of 25 were diagnosed with CMT; the others have had no testing reported.
A family history of CMT or other peripheral neuropathy should be sought at the time of diagnosis of ALL. Testing for CMT should be considered in any child with substantial vincristine-induced peripheral neurotoxicity. Treatment of such patients must be individualized. Testing of all patients with significant peripheral neuropathy would be necessary to determine the percentage of such neuropathy explained by underlying CMT.
It is well established that hepatitis C develops into cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) both of which are fatal diseases. The World Health Organization estimates that there are at least 21.3 million hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers in the Eastern Mediterranean countries, which is close to the number of carriers estimated in the Americas and Europe combined. With such a high disease burden of HCV infection in this part of the world, and in light of the new evidence that genotypes may influence the outcome of antiviral therapy, the focus of this review is on the epidemiology and distribution of HCV genotypes in the Eastern Mediterranean countries. Accumulated data show that there are two main patterns for the distribution of HCV genotypes in the Middle East: in the first pattern, genotype 4 is prevalent in most of the Arab countries, and in the second pattern, genotype 1a or 1b predominates in the non-Arab countries. Results from the limited number of clinical trials on the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 4 using peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin are encouraging. However, efforts to develop more effective antiviral therapies and the establishment of an effective HCV vaccine remain the largest challenges for the near future.
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) holds great potential as an anticancer drug, since it induces selective cell death in cancer cells but not in normal ones. However, cancer cells often acquire resistance to TRAIL, which hinders its clinical efficacy. We previously demonstrated that progesterone triggers apoptosis in human ovarian cancer (OCa) cells. In the present study, we evaluated the prospect of utilizing progestins in combination with TRAIL to enhance cell death in TRAIL-sensitive (OVCA 420, OVCA 429, and OVCA 433) and -resistant (OVCA 432) OCa cell lines. TRAIL sensitivity (60-80% cell kill) bore no correlation with expression of the TRAIL receptors (DR4, DR5) or their decoys (DcR1 and DcR2), but was associated with activation of caspase-8 and -3, and downregulation of the long isoform of FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP(L)), an anti-apoptosis mediator. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of c-FLIP(L) expression restored TRAIL sensitivity in OVCA 432 cells. Induction of c-FLIP(L) overexpression increased TRAIL resistance in TRAIL-sensitive lines. Thus, persistent high level of c-FLIP(L) expression likely mediates TRAIL resistance in OCa cells. Treatment of OCa cells with progesterone enhanced TRAIL-induced cell death (>85%), but only in TRAIL-sensitive cell lines. Combined treatment with two progestins was superior to single progestin treatment, with progesterone plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) achieving over 85% cell kill in both TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant OCa cell lines. Significantly, unlike TRAIL, progestin-induced cell death did not involve c-FLIP(L) downregulation. Hence, combined progestin regimens, with or without TRAIL, may serve as an effective therapy for OCa by circumventing the anti-apoptotic action of c-FLIP(L).
The convulsive, pro-convulsive and lethal effects of two theophylline-containing bronchodilating agents, aminophylline and acepifylline, have been evaluated in rats. Aminophylline (theophylline ethylenediamine) caused seizures and death in a dose-dependent manner; an intraperitoneal dose of 250 mg kg-1 caused seizures and death in all rats. Intraperitoneal doses of acepifylline (theophylline ethanoate of piperazine) up to 1000 mg kg-1, however, did not cause seizure or death. Further, pre-treatment of the rats by intraperitoneal administration of a subconvulsive dose (100 mg kg-1) of aminophylline caused a significant decrease in CD50 and LD50 values for pentylenetetrazole and a significant increase in the number of positive responders (i.e. rats with a pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure score of 3 or more on a seizure scale ranging from 0 to 6) and death rate compared with those obtained for rats pre-treated with an equivalent intraperitoneal dose (140 mg kg-1) of acepifylline ('equivalent dose' referred to here denotes the theophylline content of the two preparations). The study has established the neurosafety profile of acepifylline and documents a safer alternative to aminophylline for use in asthmatics suffering from concomitant epilepsy or other seizure-prone neurological defects.
Pseudotumor cerebri, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition most commonly affecting women of childbearing age who are obese or who have experienced recent weight gain. Frequently the patient complains of headache accompanied by dizziness, nausea, or visual defects, and it is characterized by elevated intracranial pressure in the absence of a space-occupying lesion or infection
A patient had been prescribed minocycline and subsequently developed symptoms 6 weeks after an increase in the original dosage. She was initially examined by an ophthalmologist, then was sent to the Emergency Department, and finally admitted under the family practice service. Articles were searched through MEDLINE, MD Consult, and Google. Key words included "pseudotumor cerebri," benign intracranial hypertension," idiopathic intracranial hypertension," and "minocycline."
Although the pathogenesis of pseudotumor cerebri is not completely understood, an association has been observed with minocycline use. This report describes a 16-year-old girl who developed idiopathic intracranial hypertension while taking minocycline for acne. Symptoms of blurred vision and severe headache unrelated to position or activity; an absence of fever, bilateral disk edema, and focalizing neurologic signs; negative neuroradiographic findings; increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure with a normal cell count; and exclusion of systemic or structural cause of increased intracranial pressure satisfy the criteria for the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Minocycline is often used by family physicians for the treatment of acne, and this complication requires vigilance to protect against potential vision loss.
The resistance of mouth opening to a constant force of 1.7 N was measured in 44 pediatric subjects anesthetized with enflurane and paralyzed with succinylcholine or vecuronium. Measurements were made during a deep level of anesthesia before relaxant administration, immediately after the loss of the adductor pollicis muscle twitch and 45 s later. In 22 patients receiving succinylcholine, there was a significant reduction in mean mouth opening (from 16.9 +/- 2.8 to 12.6 +/- 4.3 to 13.0 +/- 4.3 mm; P less than 0.0005) and an increase in jaw stiffness (from 102.3 +/- 21.9 to 154.5 +/- 77.4 to 150.5 +/- 77.0 Nm/degree; P less than 0.02) immediately after disappearance of the evoked thenar muscle twitch, as well as 45 s later. In six patients receiving succinylcholine, measurements were continued at 1 min intervals; mouth opening reduction and jaw stiffness increase lasted up to 10 min and extended beyond the return of visible twitch. One patient had a reduction of mouth opening from 20 to less than 1 mm; his corresponding jaw stiffness changed from 83.4 to 3335.4 Nm/degree. This patient, considered by us to have masseter spasm, required several attempts at tracheal intubation due to an increased resistance to mouth opening, as did one other patient. Patients receiving vecuronium showed a significant (P less than 0.02) increase of mouth opening 45 s following loss of twitch (from 19.8 +/- 3.6 to 20.9 +/- 4.1 mm; jaw stiffness changed from 87.0 +/- 15.3 to 83.0 +/- 17.2 Nm/degree). Anesthesia and surgery proceeded normally; in most patients, in excess of 1 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To assess the short-term effect and safety of citalopram in the reduction of impulsive aggression in children and adolescents.
Twelve subjects, aged 7 to 15 years, were attending a psychiatric outpatient clinic and had a profile of impulsive aggression. Subjects were treated in an open trial with citalopram for 6 weeks after a 1-week washout period. Dosage was regulated individually over a period of 4 weeks. The starting dose was 10 mg/day followed by 10 mg increments on a weekly basis. The maximum dose was not to exceed 40 mg/day. Outcome measures included the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS), the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL), and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI).
Eleven subjects completed the study Citalopram produced clinically and statistically significant reductions on target symptoms of impulsive aggression, independent of other behavioral problems, as measured by the MOAS, the CBCL, and the CGI at doses ranging from 20 to 40 mg/day (mean = 27 mg). No major adverse reactions were associated with citalopram use.
Citalopram appears to be effective and well tolerated in this sample of children and adolescents with impulsive aggression.
Electrophysiological exploration was carried out in 12 patients before and during administration of vincristine sulphate 1,4 mg/m2 body surface area. The patients had stage III or IV lymphoreticulosarcoma and received one injection of vincristine weekly for 6 weeks. Compared with pretreatment findings, (1) motor and sensory conduction velocity, as well as delay in triceps surae H reflex remained unchanged; (2) sensory nerve amplitude and density of distal muscle electromyographic recordings rapidly decreased; (3) the amplitude of distal tendinous reflexes rapidly diminished, whereas that of the H reflex remained stable. These results being similar to those observed in experimental acrylamide toxicity, where a "dying back" hemopathy has been demonstrated, it is suggested that the neuropathy induced by vincristine in man is of the same type.
Opioid peptides injected into the circulation of rats evoke a vagally mediated bradycardia. The intravenous ED50 of morphine for producing a greater than or equal to 10% fall in heart rate was determined in urethane-anesthetized rats. Hypophysectomy, or adrenalectomy plus treatment with dexamethasone (0.5 microgram/h, s.c., 1 day), procedures that remove endogenous sources of opioid peptides, increased the sensitivity of the animal to morphine bradycardia by 6-10-fold. Conversely, stressing the animals by exposure to cold (4-6 degrees C for two days) elevated the ED50 for morphine sulfate and for beta h-endorphin by about 5-fold. Dexamethasone infusions prevented the cold-induced desensitization to morphine. Intravenous administration of rat corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) also desensitized the animals to morphine. CRF alone produced a fall in blood pressure and heart rate. The bradycardia was prevented by pretreatment with naloxone. These results indicate that the sensitivity of vagal opioid chemoreceptors is influenced by endogenous sources of opioid peptides. This phenomenon can be called 'endogenous tolerance'.
The cyclic adenosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) gene family is the target of several potential therapeutic inhibitors and the PDE4B gene has been associated with schizophrenia and depression. Little, however, is known of any connection between this gene family and autism, with limited effective treatment being available for autism. We measured the expression of PDE4A and PDE4B by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting in Brodmann's area 40 (BA40, parietal cortex), BA9 (superior frontal cortex), and cerebellum from subjects with autism and matched controls. We observed a lower expression of PDE4A5, PDE4B1, PDE4B3, PDE4B4, and PDE4B2 in the cerebella of subjects with autism when compared with matched controls. In BA9, we observed the opposite: a higher expression of PDE4AX, PDE4A1, and PDE4B2 in subjects with autism. No changes were observed in BA40. Our results demonstrate altered expressions of the PDE4A and PDE4B proteins in the brains of subjects with autism and might provide new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of this debilitating disorder.
Thrombolytic therapy improves outcome in patients with myocardial infarction but is associated with an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage. For some patients, this risk may outweigh the potential benefits of thrombolytic treatment. Using data from other studies, we developed a model for the assessment of an individual's risk of intracranial haemorrhage during thrombolysis. Data were available from 150 patients with documented intracranial haemorrhage and 294 matched controls. 49 patients with intracranial haemorrhage and 122 controls had been treated with streptokinase, whereas 88 cases and 148 controls had received alteplase. By multivariate analysis, four factors were identified as independent predictors of intracranial haemorrhage; age over 65 years (odds ratio 2.2 [95% Cl 1.4-3.5]), body weight below 70 kg (2.1 [1.3-3.2]), hypertension on hospital admission (2.0 [1.2-3.2]), and administration of alteplase (1.6 [1.0-2.5]). If the overall incidence of intracranial haemorrhage is assumed to be 0.75%, patients without risk factors who receive streptokinase have a 0.26% probability of intracranial haemorrhage. The risk is 0.96%, 1.32%, and 2.17% in patients with one, two, or three risk factors, respectively. We present a model for individual risk assessment that can be used easily in clinical practice.
The objective was to compare the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) procainamide and amiodarone for the termination of spontaneous stable sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).
A historical cohort study of consecutive adult patients with stable sustained VT treated with IV amiodarone or procainamide was performed at four urban hospitals. Patients were identified for enrollment by admissions for VT and treatment with the study agents in the emergency department (ED) from 1993 to 2008. The primary measured outcome was VT termination within 20 minutes of onset of study medicine infusion. A secondary effectiveness outcome was the ultimate need for electrical therapy to terminate the VT episode. Major adverse effects were tabulated, and blood pressure responses to medication infusions were compared.
There were 97 infusions of amiodarone or procainamide in 90 patients with VT, but the primary outcome was unknown after 14 infusions due to administration of another antidysrhythmic during the 20-minute observation period. The rates of VT termination were 25% (13/53) and 30% (9/30) for amiodarone and procainamide, respectively. The adjusted odds of termination with procainamide compared to amiodarone was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.4 to 3.9). Ultimately, 35/66 amiodarone patients (53%, 95% CI=40 to 65%) and 13/31 procainamide patients (42%, 95% CI=25 to 61%) required electrical therapy for VT termination. Hypotension led to cessation of medicine infusion or immediate direct current cardioversion (DCCV) in 4/66 (6%, 95% CI=2 to 15%) and 6/31 (19%, 95% CI=7 to 37%) patients who received amiodarone and procainamide, respectively.
Procainamide was not more effective than amiodarone for the termination of sustained VT, but the ability to detect a significant difference was limited by the study design and potential confounding. As used in practice, both agents were relatively ineffective and associated with clinically important proportions of patients with decreased blood pressure.
Short-term effects of air pollution on common morbidity are largely unknown. The authors explored links between daily levels of air pollution (nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10 microm in diameter (PM(10))) and medical home visits made for diverse reasons in Bordeaux, France, during 2000-2006. Daily numbers of visits were obtained from a network of general practitioners. The excess relative risk (ERR) of a visit for each indicator associated with increased pollutant levels was estimated by fitting a Poisson regression model, controlling for well-known confounding factors and temporal trends. Positive and significant associations were found between air pollution and most health indicators. A 10-microg/m(3) increase in PM(10) levels was associated with increases in visits for upper and lower respiratory diseases (ERRs were 1.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.3, 2.7) and 2.5% (95% CI: 0.5, 4.4), respectively), headache and asthenia (ERR = 3.5%, 95% CI: 1.3, 5.9), and skin rash and conjunctivitis (ERR = 3.2%, 95% CI: -0.2, 6.8). Significant associations were also found between nitrogen dioxide and ozone and several health indicators. Distributed-lag models showed no harvesting effect, and some effects persisted up to 15 days after exposure increased. These results suggest that considering only the most severe effects of air pollution leads to underestimation of its impact on public health.
Fifty chronic schizophrenics were randomly assigned to a 16-week treatment either with fluspirilene or with fluphenazine decanoate. The aim of the study was to compare the antipsychotic action and the side effects of the two neuroleptics. Fluphenazine decanoate caused more side effects and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant in the items tremor, severe extrapyramidal effects and parkinsonism. More patients in the fluspirilene group (nine patients) compared with only three in the fluphenazine decanoate group remained free of side effects during the whole trial. Judged from the BPRS fluspirilene proved an equally potent neuroleptic with fluphenazine decanoate although statistically significant improvement has been obtained in more items of the scale in the fluspirilene group. The improvement in the NOSIE-30 was much more clear in the fluspirilene group. Although Clinical Global Impressions of the investigators and the nursing personnel favored fluspirilene, the differences between the two groups were not statistically significant.
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly lethal neoplasm. S-1 has been developed as a novel oral antineoplastic agent based on the modulation of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) bioactivity. This study was conducted to investigate the preclinical therapeutic effect of S-1 on MPM.
We used three human MPM cell lines, Y-MESO-14, NCI-H290 and MSTO-211H. In vitro proliferation of human MPM cells was determined by MTT assay. Human MPM cells were orthotopically implanted into thoracic cavity of SCID mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with S-1 or vehicle.
The combination of 5-FU and 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) was more effective than 5-FU alone in inhibiting MPM cell proliferation in vitro. This combination was most effective in Y-MESO-14 cells, which co-expressed high protein level of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP). In vivo data showed that treatment with S-1 significantly reduced thoracic tumors and pleural effusion produced by Y-MESO-14 cells. Moreover, treatment with S-1 prolonged the survival of Y-MESO-14 cell-bearing SCID mice.
We demonstrated that S-1 was effective for inhibiting the proliferation of MPM cells, particularly with both DPD and TP expressions, suggesting that S-1 might be therapeutically effective for control of MPM.
The putative tumor suppressor NORE1A (RASSF5) is a member of the Ras association domain family and is commonly inactivated in human cancer. The closely related gene family member and functional collaborator RASSF1A is a bona fide tumor suppressor and is frequently involved in neuroblastoma. In the present study, we sought to investigate the role of NORE1A in human neuroblastoma. A panel of tumors (36 neuroblastomas and 4 ganglioneuromas) and neuroblastoma cell lines was assessed for NORE1A gene expression by Taqman quantitative RT-PCR. Promoter methylation was quantitatively determined by methylation sensitive pyrosequencing. The antitumourigenic role was functionally investigated in Nore1a transfected SK-N-BE (2) cells by fluorescent inhibition of caspase activity and BrdU incorporation assays. Neuroblastoma cells showed very low or absent NORE1A mRNA expression, which could not be reversed by trichostatin A or 5-aza-cytidine treatments. Neuroblastoma tumors showed suppressed NORE1A gene expression that was particularly pronounced in cases without MYCN amplification or 1p loss. Methylation of the NORE1A promoter was not observed in primary tumors and only one out of seven neuroblastoma cell lines displayed weak partial methylation. Transient expression of Nore1a resulted in enhanced apoptosis and delayed cell cycle progression. In conclusion NORE1A appears to be strongly suppressed in neuroblastic tumors and reconstitution of its expression diminishes the tumorigenic phenotype. Promotor methylation is not a common mechanism responsible for NORE1A transcriptional suppression in this tumor type.
Capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons are nociceptive neurons that release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on activation by various noxious stimuli. CGRP has been shown to increase the endothelial production of prostacyclin, which reduces ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced liver injury. Therefore, if the sensory neurons can be activated by the pathologic process of hepatic I/R, they might help ameliorate I/R-induced liver injury by promoting the endothelial production of prostacyclin, also known as prostaglandin I(2). In this study, we examined these possibilities using a rat model of I/R-induced liver injury. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 60-minute hepatic ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Hepatic levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha) (6-keto-PGF(1alpha)), a stable metabolite of prostacyclin, were significantly increased after hepatic I/R, peaking 1 hour after reperfusion. Administration of capsaicin and CGRP significantly enhanced I/R-induced increases in hepatic levels of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), increased hepatic-tissue blood flow after reperfusion, and inhibited the I/R-induced increase in tissue levels of both tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and myeloperoxidase. Capsazepine, a vanilloid receptor antagonist; CGRP(8-37), a CGRP-receptor antagonist; l-nitro-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME), a nonselective inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS); and indomethacin, a nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, inhibited the I/R-induced increases in hepatic tissue levels of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and decreased hepatic-tissue blood flow after reperfusion. These compounds significantly enhanced the I/R-induced increases in hepatic tissue levels of both TNF-alpha and myeloperoxidase. Although I/R-induced liver injury was significantly reduced by capsaicin and CGRP, it was exacerbated by capsazepine, CGRP(8-37), L-NAME, and indomethacin. Administration of aminoguanidine, a selective inhibitor of the inducible form of NOS, and NS-398, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, demonstrated no effects on the liver injury or the hepatic levels of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha). These findings strongly suggest that the activation of the sensory neurons helps ameliorate I/R-induced liver injury both by increasing hepatic-tissue blood flow and by limiting inflammatory response through the enhancement of endothelial production of prostacyclin. In the sensory neuron-mediated enhancement of endothelial production of prostacyclin, CGRP-induced activation of both endothelial NOS and cyclooxygenase-1 may be critically involved.
We sequenced whole exomes of ten clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) and performed a screen of ∼1,100 genes in 88 additional ccRCCs, from which we discovered 12 previously unidentified genes mutated at elevated frequencies in ccRCC. Notably, we detected frequent mutations in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway (UMPP), and alterations in the UMPP were significantly associated with overexpression of HIF1α and HIF2α in the tumors (P = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively). Our findings highlight the potential contribution of UMPP to ccRCC tumorigenesis through the activation of the hypoxia regulatory network.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common, heritable neuropsychiatric disorder of unknown etiology. We performed a whole-genome copy number variation (CNV) study on 1,013 cases with ADHD and 4,105 healthy children of European ancestry using 550,000 SNPs. We evaluated statistically significant findings in multiple independent cohorts, with a total of 2,493 cases with ADHD and 9,222 controls of European ancestry, using matched platforms. CNVs affecting metabotropic glutamate receptor genes were enriched across all cohorts (P = 2.1 × 10(-9)). We saw GRM5 (encoding glutamate receptor, metabotropic 5) deletions in ten cases and one control (P = 1.36 × 10(-6)). We saw GRM7 deletions in six cases, and we saw GRM8 deletions in eight cases and no controls. GRM1 was duplicated in eight cases. We experimentally validated the observed variants using quantitative RT-PCR. A gene network analysis showed that genes interacting with the genes in the GRM family are enriched for CNVs in ∼10% of the cases (P = 4.38 × 10(-10)) after correction for occurrence in the controls. We identified rare recurrent CNVs affecting glutamatergic neurotransmission genes that were overrepresented in multiple ADHD cohorts.
