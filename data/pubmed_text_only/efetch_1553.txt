In an alcoholic patient, catatonia developed while he was receiving disulfiram (Antabuse). Resolution of the question whether his state was classically catatonic required a detailed review of the literature on the subject. The conclusion reached is that the original definition still holds for psychiatric illness, but application of the term to neurological and metabolic states has often been based on imprecise criteria and failure to consider akinetic mutism and extrapyramidal motor disturbances as factors. The action of disulfiram as an inhibitor of dopamine beta hydroxylase provides a possible mechanism for the cerebral toxic effect, but nonetheless the various interpretations remain largely speculative.
Hemodynamics and endocardial [Ca2+]i transients were studied during ventricular fibrillation in isolated perfused rat hearts. During 1 minute of pacing-induced ventricular fibrillation, the diastolic fibrillatory [Ca2+]i level increased significantly (p less than 0.001) above the end-systolic [Ca2+]i concentration of the last regular contraction. A bolus of lidocaine led to a decrease in the [Ca2+]i level during fibrillation (p less than 0.007) to the end-diastolic level of baseline conditions and then subsequently converted the heart to sinus rhythm. In 13 (62%) of the 21 studies described, post-lidocaine ventricular fibrillation converted to a brief period of asystole followed by sinus rhythm; in 8 (38%) of the studies, post-lidocaine ventricular fibrillation switched to ventricular tachycardia. Postfibrillatory cardiac dysfunction was related to the duration and degree of elevated diastolic [Ca2+]i. The authors conclude that [Ca2+]i levels are increased during ventricular fibrillation, and that lidocaine treatment leads to a prompt decrease in [Ca2+]i preceding conversion to sinus rhythm.
Although extracellular application of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been extensively documented to produce a variety of cellular responses through a family of specific G protein-coupled receptors, the in vivo organismal role of LPA signaling remains largely unknown. The first identified LPA receptor gene, lp(A1)/vzg-1/edg-2, was previously shown to have remarkably enriched embryonic expression in the cerebral cortex and dorsal olfactory bulb and postnatal expression in myelinating glia including Schwann cells. Here, we show that targeted deletion of lp(A1) results in approximately 50% neonatal lethality, impaired suckling in neonatal pups, and loss of LPA responsivity in embryonic cerebral cortical neuroblasts with survivors showing reduced size, craniofacial dysmorphism, and increased apoptosis in sciatic nerve Schwann cells. The suckling defect was responsible for the death among lp(A1)((-/-)) neonates and the stunted growth of survivors. Impaired suckling behavior was attributable to defective olfaction, which is likely related to developmental abnormalities in olfactory bulb and/or cerebral cortex. Our results provide evidence that endogenous lysophospholipid signaling requires an lp receptor gene and indicate that LPA signaling through the LP(A1) receptor is required for normal development of an inborn, neonatal behavior.
Causes of death, with special reference to cerebral haemorrhage, among 240 patients with pathologically verified Parkinson's disease were investigated using the Annuals of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan from 1981 to 1985. The leading causes of death were pneumonia and bronchitis (44.1%), malignant neoplasms (11.6%), heart diseases (4.1%), cerebral infarction (3.7%) and septicaemia (3.3%). Cerebral haemorrhage was the 11th most frequent cause of death, accounting for only 0.8% of deaths among the patients, whereas it was the 5th most common cause of death among the Japanese general population in 1985. The low incidence of cerebral haemorrhage as a cause of death in patients with Parkinson's disease may reflect the hypotensive effect of levodopa and a hypotensive mechanism due to reduced noradrenaline levels in the parkinsonian brain.
We present the case of a 17-year-old girl who ingested 24 to 36 g fenoprofen as a suicidal gesture. She presented with coma, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory depression within four hours of ingestion. The most common adverse effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs occur in both therapeutic and toxic doses and include gastrointestinal upset, blood dyscrasias, and analgesic nephropathy. The propionic acid derivatives of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including fenoprofen and ibuprofen, are rarely associated with severe toxic effects. This is the first report of pure fenoprofen overdose presenting as coma and metabolic acidosis.
After cisplatin- and bleomycin-containing chemotherapy for testicular cancer, part of the patient population will develop acute or long-term cardiovascular toxicity. It is largely unknown whether standard tests can be used to assess chemotherapy-induced cardiovascular changes.
In 65 testicular cancer patients (median age, 27 years; range, 18 to 48 years), we measured the following cardiovascular parameters before and within 10 weeks after completion of cisplatin-based chemotherapy: platelet numbers, plasma levels of hemostatic and fibrinolytic factors, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, baroreflex sensitivity, intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery, and flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery.
Compared with prechemotherapy values, the intima-media thickness of the carotid artery and plasma von Willebrand factor levels increased significantly after treatment. Platelet numbers and plasma levels of other hemostatic and fibrinolytic factors did not appear to change significantly. Blood pressure decreased significantly, but flow-mediated vasodilation and baroreflex sensitivity did not change.
In testicular cancer patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, we found an increase in plasma von Willebrand factor levels and in the intima-media thickness of the carotid artery. These changes may indicate chemotherapy-induced vascular damage and be of prognostic significance for the development of cardiovascular complications in the long term.
Perfluorononanoate (PFNA), a perfluorinated alkyl acid containing nine carbon chains, has been detected in abiotic and biotic matrices worldwide. Although a few studies have reported toxic effects of PFNA, little information of the mechanism has been offered. In this study, the effects of PFNA exposure on thymus and the related mechanisms were investigated. Male rats were orally dosed with 0, 1, 3, or 5 mg PFNA/kg/day for 14 days. A significant decrease of body weight and thymus weight were observed in the rats receiving 3 or 5 mg PFNA/kg/day. Histopathological examination revealed dose-dependent increases in thymocyte apoptosis. Rats receiving 3 or 5 mg PFNA/kg/day exhibited increased interleukin (IL)-1 and decreased IL-2 concentrations in sera, whereas elevated IL-4 and cortisol levels only occurred in the highest dose group. Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) was increased in the thymi of all dosed rats, and a similar trend occurred for PPAR-gamma in the two highest dose groups. The mRNA levels of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor-kappa B, p65 subunit, and inhibitory protein IkappaBalpha were unchanged; however, increased and decreased mRNA levels of p38 kinase were found in rats exposed to 3 or 5 mg PFNA/kg/day, respectively. Decreased Bcl-2 mRNA levels were observed in rats receiving 5 mg PFNA/kg/day. A significant increase in protein levels of phospho-JNK was found in all PFNA-treated rats. Phospho-p38 was significantly enhanced in 1 and 3 mg PFNA/kg/day groups, whereas phospho-IkappaBalpha remained consistent in all rats studied. Together, these data suggested that apart from the activation of PPARs, PFNA exposure in rats lead to the alteration of serum cytokines, which subsequently activated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways and potentially modulated the immune system. Additionally, increased serum cortisol and decreased expression of Bcl-2 in thymus likely contributed to the PFNA-induced thymocyte apoptosis.
A 42-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C has visited our hospital since October 2003. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis (A1/F1) . Therapy was initiated with interferon (IFN) alpha-2b and ribavirin in February 2004. Two months later, the patient developed left facial weakness. Laboratory findings showed cryoglobulinemia and abnormal thyroid function without any evidence of other viral infections. Idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy was diagnosed. IFN was discontinued at week 9 of therapy, but she obtained sustained virological response and her symptoms resolved at 6 month after the withdrawal.
To estimate the toxicity and response rate of high-dose liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (TLC D-99, Evacet, The Liposome Company Inc, Princeton, NJ) in patients with advanced breast cancer.
Fifty-two breast cancer patients with bidimensionally measurable metastatic disease and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease received a 135 mg/m2 intravenous (i.v.) bolus of TLC D-99 with 5 microg/kg of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor via subcutaneous injection every 21 days.
The median number of treatment cycles of TLC D-99 was three (range, one to 10 cycles), and the median total cumulative dose of TLC D-99 was 405 mg/m2 (range, 135 to 1,065 mg/m2). Grade IV neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and mucositis were experienced by 48 (92%), 46 (88%), and 10 (19%) patients, respectively. Twenty (38%) of patients experienced cardiac toxicity: four (8%) experienced a decrease of 20% or more in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to a final value > or = 50%, nine (17%) experienced a decrease of 10% or more in LVEF to a final value less than 50%, and seven (13%) developed symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), including one patient who died of cardiomyopathy after receiving a total dose of 1,035 mg/m2. In a stepwise logistic regression model, the significant risk factors for the development of CHF were the cumulative dose of prior adjuvant doxorubicin (P = .007) and the total cumulative dose of TLC D-99 (P = .032). The overall response rate was 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32% to 61%) on an intent-to-treat basis. The median duration of response was 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.1 to 19.6 months) and the median progression-free survival was 6.1 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 7.5 months).
There was no added therapeutic benefit to the dose escalation of TLC D-99 in this study. A high rate of cardiotoxicity was also observed, especially among patients who had received prior adjuvant doxorubicin. This was probably attributable to the dose and schedule of TLC D-99 used in this trial, as well as the patient's lifetime cumulative doxorubicin dose. Administration of high-dose TLC D-99 at 135 mg/m2 every 3 weeks by i.v. bolus infusion does not warrant further investigation.
We studied the value of dipyridamole-echocardiography test in comparison with clinical, resting electrocardiogram and echocardiogram variables in predicting cardiac events occurring in 539 consecutive patients referred for dipyridamole-echocardiography test from 1984 to 1987. There were 118 cardiac events: 11 cardiac deaths, 12 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and 95 coronary revascularization (bypass or angioplasty) procedures. A Cox survival analysis identified echocardiographic positivity after dipyridamole administration as the best predictor of cardiac events (relative risk ratio, 2.7). The next most powerful predictor was angina after dipyridamole administration (relative risk ratio, 1.9). Cardiac events occurred in 14 (6%) of 253 patients with normal high-dose dipyridamole echocardiographic test results, in 21 (26%) of 82 patients with high-dose dipyridamole echocardiographic positivity (0.84 mg/kg during 10 minutes), and in 83 (41%) of 204 patients with low-dose dipyridamole echocardiographic positivity (0.56 mg/kg during 4 minutes) (p less than 0.0001). In a subset of 341 patients, exercise electrocardiography stress test and coronary angiography were also available. A Cox survival analysis again identified echocardiographic positivity after dipyridamole as the best predictor of cardiac events (relative risk ratio, 1.9) followed by a pathologic coronary arteriography (relative risk ratio, 1.2). We conclude that the presence and timing of a transient dyssynergy during dipyridamole stress are useful predictors of subsequent cardiac events.
Studies support the involvement of mPFC dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems in the development of cocaine sensitization. GABA is known to modulate dopamine and glutamatergic systems in the mPFC. In addition, recent reports have suggested that cocaine sensitization might be associated with a decrease in GABAB receptor responsiveness in the mPFC. Hence, in vivo microdialysis of the mPFC was performed to examine the effects on extracellular GABA levels within the mPFC of a cocaine challenge subsequent to repeated cocaine administration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given four daily injections of saline (1.0 mL/kg, i.p.) or cocaine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) and challenged with the same dose of saline or cocaine 1, 7 or 28 days later. Acute cocaine produced a motor-stimulant response that was significantly augmented in repeated cocaine animals at all withdrawal time points. Moreover, sensitized animals exhibited a significant increase in extracellular GABA levels after 1 and 7 days but not 28 days following repeated cocaine exposure. These data suggest that cocaine-induced sensitization is associated with a transient increase in mPFC GABA transmission.
This study was designed to assess the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its receptor in the generation and maintenance of secondary mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin in rats. Paw withdrawal responses (PWRs) to von Frey hairs with different bending forces applied on the rat paw were tested in this study. CGRP(8-37), a specific antagonist of CGRP 1 receptors, was delivered through a microdialysis fiber inserted across the dorsal horn. Post- and pretreatment paradigms were followed. When CGRP(8-37) was administered 1h after capsaicin injection, the mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia were partially reversed in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, when rats were treated with CGRP(8-37) prior to capsaicin injection, the PWRs to von Frey applications were significantly reduced as compared to control animals. Collectively, these results suggest that CGRP receptors present in the dorsal horn are involved in the generation and maintenance of nociceptive behaviors associated with cutaneous inflammation.
This study was aimed at determining if the frequency and pattern of acute liver failure (ALF) following halothane anaesthesia had decreased during the last 11 years in comparison with a previous series of 48 patients referred between 1965 and 1984 and whether clinical outcome had been altered by the introduction of liver transplantation.
Between January 1985 and December 1995, all patients with halothane-induced ALF admitted to the Liver Failure Unit at King's College Hospital were identified. Four other European liver transplant centres with a known interest in acute liver failure also provided data.
Of the 18 patients admitted, the clinical data were complete in 15. Ten of these patients had at least one previous halothane anaesthesia with documented clinical complications following the earlier exposure in six. Four patients had been re-exposed to halothane within 1 month of the penultimate halothane anaesthesia. Of the 15 patients four survived with medical management alone and 11 patients fulfilled transplant criteria. Four of the latter group were not listed because of rapidly deteriorating medical state and died, and of the seven patients who were listed, three died without a liver becoming available and four were transplanted, one of whom survived. No patient who had grade 4 encephalopathy and a prothrombin time > 50 s survived without a transplant. The survey of the other European liver centres recorded a total of 19 patients with halothane-induced ALF including three cases reported in the literature. Of those, 13 patients had been transplanted with nine survivors.
Cases of halothane-induced acute liver failure still occur, albeit at a lower frequency than previously, and the Committee on Safety of Medicines guidelines are not being followed. The results of transplantation in these patients are encouraging.
The demonstrated utility of the nucleoside analog ribavirin in the treatment of certain viral diseases can be ascribed to its multiple distinct properties. These properties may vary in relative importance in differing viral disease conditions and include the direct inhibition of viral replication, the promotion of T-cell-mediated immune responses via an enhanced type 1 cytokine response, and a reduction of circulating alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels associated with hepatic injury. Ribavirin also has certain known toxicities, including the induction of anemia upon chronic administration. To determine if all these properties are linked, we compared the D-nucleoside ribavirin to its L-enantiomer (ICN 17261) with regard to these properties. Strong similarities were seen for these two compounds with respect to induction of type 1 cytokine bias in vitro, enhancement of type 1 cytokine responses in vivo, and the reduction of serum ALT levels in a murine hepatitis model. In contrast, ICN 17261 had no in vitro antiviral activity against a panel of RNA and DNA viruses, while ribavirin exhibited its characteristic activity profile. Importantly, the preliminary in vivo toxicology profile of ICN 17261 is significantly more favorable than that of ribavirin. Administration of 180 mg of ICN 17261 per kg of body weight to rats by oral gavage for 4 weeks generated substantial serum levels of drug but no observable clinical pathology, whereas equivalent doses of ribavirin induced a significant anemia and leukopenia. Thus, structural modification of ribavirin can dissociate its immunomodulatory properties from its antiviral and toxicologic properties, resulting in a compound (ICN 17261) with interesting therapeutic potential.
The cause of schizophrenia is unknown, but it has a significant genetic component. Pharmacologic studies, studies of gene expression in man, and studies of mouse mutants suggest involvement of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmitter systems. However, so far, strong association has not been found between schizophrenia and variants of the genes encoding components of these systems. Here, we report the results of a genomewide scan of schizophrenia families in Iceland; these results support previous work, done in five populations, showing that schizophrenia maps to chromosome 8p. Extensive fine-mapping of the 8p locus and haplotype-association analysis, supplemented by a transmission/disequilibrium test, identifies neuregulin 1 (NRG1) as a candidate gene for schizophrenia. NRG1 is expressed at central nervous system synapses and has a clear role in the expression and activation of neurotransmitter receptors, including glutamate receptors. Mutant mice heterozygous for either NRG1 or its receptor, ErbB4, show a behavioral phenotype that overlaps with mouse models for schizophrenia. Furthermore, NRG1 hypomorphs have fewer functional NMDA receptors than wild-type mice. We also demonstrate that the behavioral phenotypes of the NRG1 hypomorphs are partially reversible with clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug used to treat schizophrenia.
The mechanisms by which endogenous renal prostaglandins regulate water excretion were investigated in these studies. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis slowed water diuresis in water-loaded unanesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats and in Brattleboro rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus owing to absence of endogenous vasopressin. In both strains, treatment with indomethacin or meclofenamate increased the osmolality of the renal papilla by raising sodium and urea content, and also increased the osmolality of the urine. Endogenous creatinine clearance and solute excretion were unchanged. The data are consistent with an effect of prostaglandins on solute transport by renal tubules and demonstrate that endogenous prostaglandins influence water excretion by a mechanism independent of the presence of antidiuretic hormone.
A decrease in the electrocardiographic limb lead QRS voltage of greater than or equal to 30% was highly correlated with the development of congestive heart failure in patients treated with adriamycin (ADM). It is felt that if a decrease in limb lead QRS voltage greater than or equal to 30% were detected in a patient receiving ADM, cardiomyopathy might be avoided or ameliorated by discontinuation of the drug.
Long-term contact with mercury may induce membranous nephropathy (MN); however, the clinical pathologic features and pathogenesis of mercury-induced MN have not been investigated.
The present study retrospectively evaluated 11 cases of mercury-induced MN to analyze its causes and its clinical and pathologic features.
A total of 10 women and 1 man ages 15 to 45 years were enrolled in the present study. Mercury exposure was caused by mercury-containing pills (five patients), skin lightening cream (four patients), hair-dyeing agents (one patient), and mercury vapor (one patient). The duration of contact with mercury ranged from 2 to 60 months, and the urinary mercury concentrations were 1.5 to 50 times higher than reference values. All patients presented with proteinuria and normal renal function; three had nephrotic syndrome. Light microscopy revealed thickened glomerular basement membrane and mildly proliferative mesangial cells. Acute tubulointerstitial injury occurred in three patients. The immunofluorescence findings showed granular deposits of IgG and C3 along the glomerular capillary wall, mostly accompanied by deposits of C4 and C1q. IgG1 and IgG4 (predominantly IgG1) deposits were observed along the glomerular capillary loops. Nine patients reached complete remission in follow-up after withdrawal from mercury exposure.
Deposits of IgG1 subclasses in renal tissues indicated that the pathogenesis of mercury-induced MN differs from that of idiopathic MN. It is important that clinicians are aware that mercury exposure should be considered a possible cause of membranous nephropathy.
A 50-year-old male patient treated with mesalazine for Crohn's disease was admitted in our unit for a chest pain, associated with nonspecific ST depression or ECG and troponin elevation. Coronarography showed minimal changes while SPECT imagery suggested a posterobasal subendocardial infarction, so that the diagnosis was unclear between ischemic disease and mesalazine-induced myocarditis. Eventually, MRI demonstrated clearly a subendocardial posterior infarction eliciting the diagnosis of mesalazine-induced myocarditis. This case report illustrates, in our opinion, that MRI is of invaluable interest in evaluating the characteristics of myocardium, and must be the cornerstone in the diagnosis of myocardial diseases.
This is a case series of 5 patients who were treated with the direct antithrombin agents (lepirudin or argatroban) for known or suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia thrombosis syndrome (HITTs). Coincidentally all had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The DIC parameters improved with treatment and each patient was successfully discharged from the hospital. These observations provide evidence that the direct antithrombin inhibitors, lepirudin and argatroban, can improve DIC. Moreover the presence of DIC in a patient with suspected HlTTs should not mitigate against the use of these agents.
The repeated administration of psychostimulant drugs produces a persistent and long-lasting increase ("sensitization") in their psychomotor effects, which is thought to be due to changes in the neural circuitry that mediate these behaviors. One index of neuronal activation used to identify brain regions altered by repeated exposure to drugs involves their ability to induce immediate early genes, such as c-fos. Numerous reports have demonstrated that past drug experience alters the ability of drugs to induce c-fos in the striatum, but very few have examined Fos protein expression in the two major compartments in the striatum--the so-called patch/striosome and matrix.
In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the effects of pretreatment with methamphetamine on the ability of a subsequent methamphetamine challenge to induce Fos protein expression in the patch and matrix compartments of the dorsolateral and dorsomedial caudate-putamen and in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens). Animals pretreated with methamphetamine developed robust psychomotor sensitization. A methamphetamine challenge increased the number of Fos-positive cells in all areas of the dorsal and ventral striatum. However, methamphetamine challenge induced Fos expression in more cells in the patch than in the matrix compartment in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial caudate-putamen. Furthermore, past experience with methamphetamine increased the number of methamphetamine-induced Fos positive cells in the patch compartment of the dorsal caudate putamen, but not in the matrix or in the core or shell of the nucleus accumbens.
These data suggest that drug-induced alterations in the patch compartment of the dorsal caudate-putamen may preferentially contribute to some of the enduring changes in brain activity and behavior produced by repeated treatment with methamphetamine.
Tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) is an autosomal dominant late-onset distal myopathy linked to chromosome 2q31. The linked region includes the giant TTN gene, which encodes the central sarcomeric protein, titin. We have previously shown a secondary calpain-3 defect to be associated with TMD, which further underscored that titin is the candidate. We now report the first mutations in TTN to cause a human skeletal-muscle disease, TMD. In Mex6, the last exon of TTN, a unique 11-bp deletion/insertion mutation, changing four amino acid residues, completely cosegregated with all tested 81 Finnish patients with TMD in 12 unrelated families. The mutation was not found in 216 Finnish control samples. In a French family with TMD, a Leu-->Pro mutation at position 293,357 in Mex6 was discovered. Mex6 is adjacent to the known calpain-3 binding site Mex5 of M-line titin. Immunohistochemical analysis using two exon-specific antibodies directed to the M-line region of titin demonstrated the specific loss of carboxy-terminal titin epitopes in the TMD muscle samples that we studied, thus implicating a functional defect of the M-line titin in the genesis of the TMD disease phenotype.
Lovastatin is clinically used to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia and successfully lowers cholesterol levels. The mechanism of action of lovastatin is inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA. Inhibition of this enzyme could also inhibit the intrinsic biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), but there have not been definitive data on whether lovastatin reduces levels of CoQ10 as it does cholesterol. The clinical use of lovastatin is to reduce a risk of cardiac disease, and if lovastatin were to reduce levels of CoQ10, this reduction would constitute a new risk of cardiac disease, since it is established that CoQ10 is indispensable for cardiac function. We have conducted three related protocols to determine whether lovastatin does indeed inhibit the biosynthesis of CoQ10. One protocol was done on rats, and is reported in the preceding paper [Willis, R. A., Folkers, K., Tucker, J. L., Ye, C.-Q., Xia, L.-J. & Tamagawa, H. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 8928-8930]. The other two protocols are reported here. One involved patients in a hospital, and the other involved a volunteer who permitted extraordinary monitoring of CoQ10 and cholesterol levels and cardiac function. All data from the three protocols revealed that lovastatin does indeed lower levels of CoQ10. The five hospitalized patients, 43-72 years old, revealed increased cardiac disease from lovastatin, which was life-threatening for patients having class IV cardiomyopathy before lovastatin or after taking lovastatin. Oral administration of CoQ10 increased blood levels of CoQ10 and was generally accompanied by an improvement in cardiac function. Although a successful drug, lovastatin does have side effects, particularly including liver dysfunction, which presumably can be caused by the lovastatin-induced deficiency of CoQ10.
Systolic time intervals are of value in measuring left ventricular function. The ratio of the pre-ejection period to the left ventricular ejection time (PEP/LVET) was determined serially in 60 children with cancer receiving anthracycline drugs. Measurements were examined for their predictive value in determining incipient anthracycline cardiomyopathy. An increase in the PEP/LVET ratio was not followed by clinical failure in the majority of patients. Of two patients who developed presumed anthracycline cardiomyopathy, only one demonstrated an increase in the ratio prior to going into heart failure. The value of the PEP/LVET ratio in children for predicting anthracycline cardiomyopathy appears limited, based on the results of this study.
