Because of the utility of the N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide (FANFT) rat model in the study of bladder cancer, the effect of dose on FANFT-induced bladder carcinogenesis was evaluated. Weaning male F344 rats were given FANFT in the diet at doses of 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, and 0.0005% for 30 weeks and then a control diet for 22 weeks. A control group received only the control diet throughout the experiment. Papillary tumors were present at the higher doses, hyperplasia of various degrees of severly was present at the intermediate doses, and minimal hyperplasia was observed in 4 of 16 rats at the 0.005% dose; no mucosal abnormalities were observed at the two lower doses or in the control group. Bladder epithelium from selected animals was also examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after 10 weeks and again at the end of the experiment. Hyperplastic mucosa with pleomorphic microvilli similar to that previously demonstrated for 0.2% FANFT was observed at 10 weeks in rats fed 0.1% FANFT. Hyperplastic mucosa with pleomorphic microvilli was also observed at 52 weeks in rats fed 0.1% and 0.05% FANFT. Hyperplastic mucosa without pleomorphic microvilli was observed in rats fed 0.01 and 0.005% FANFT. The bladder appeared normal by light microscopy and SEM at the two lower doses and in the control group at both the 10- and 52-week intervals. A dose relationship was thus demonstrated for FANFT-induced bladder carcinogenesis in male F344 rats, and more severe surface changes were observed by SEM as the dose increased.
The aim of the study was to compare safety, efficacy and tolerability of risperidone with haloperidol in the treatment of Autistic Disorder (AD).
This study was designed as a double-blind, prospective, for a 12-week period. A total of 30 subjects, between the ages of 8 and 18 with AD based on DSM IV criteria, were included in the study. Behavioral Rating Scales were performed by the investigators and the parents. Safety assessment included vital signs, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, adverse events, laboratory tests, extrapyramidal symptoms and the side effects. Both treatments were applied in a once daily dosage regimen of 0.01-0.08 mg/kg/day.
The reduction from baseline in Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale (RF-RLRS), sensory motor (subscale I) and language (subscale V) scores were significant in risperidone group (P < 0.05). Compared to haloperidol, risperidone led to a significantly greater reduction in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Turgay DSM-IV Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) scale scores (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). There was a greater increase of prolactin in the risperidone group, while alanine amino transferase (ALT) had further increased in the haloperidol group. Sensory motor behaviors (subscale I) and language at the end of the 12th week, RF-RLRS sensory motor and language subscale scores decreased in the risperidone group further than the other group (P < 0.05).
Risperidone was found to be more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of behavioral symptoms, impulsivity, language skills, and impaired social relations in children with AD. These results demonstrated that both drugs were safe and well tolerated in the treatment of AD.
To investigate the protective effect of testosterone propionate (TP) on reproductive toxicity caused by endosulfan in male mice, three group experiments were designed: the control group received 0 and 0, the endosulfan group received 0.8 and 0, and the endosulfan + TP group received 0.8 mg/kg/d endosulfan and 10 mg/kg/d TP, respectively. The results showed that TP significantly prevented the declines of concentration and motility rates in sperm, reduced the rate of sperm abnormalities in epididymis; and antagonized the decreases in spermatogenous cell and sperm numbers in testes induced by endosulfan. TP also decreased the numbers of cavities formed, prevented the decreases of plasma testosterone and androgen receptor (AR) mRNA in testicular tissue, alleviated the increase of LH induced by endosulfan. It is likely that TP relieve the reproductive toxicity by reversing the endosulfan-induced decreases in testosterone secretion and AR expression that resulted from the alteration of Leydig cell function. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We report a case of a patient with history of alcohol abuse, treatment for hepatitis C and repeated strenuous physical activity who developed severe muscle pain and weakness during statin therapy. The symptoms persisted after discontinuation of the drug. The diagnosis of myopathy was made clinically and by electromyography. As his symptoms persisted a muscle biopsy was performed which showed inclusions consistent with hyaline inclusions. Hyaline inclusion myopathy is discussed in the context of this case with review of the literature.
The developmental effects of exposure to various doses of buprenorphine, methadone, or water during the perinatal period were studied in the rat. Rats were exposed to buprenorphine (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg/day), methadone (9 mg/kg/day), and/or water prenatally, postnatally, or both pre- and postnatally, via maternally implanted osmotic minipumps. Fetal and maternal mortality and morbidity were assessed, as well as the acquisition of several developmental milestones, pup weight gain, precipitated withdrawal, and the antinociceptive effect of morphine. Although perinatal exposure to buprenorphine failed to produce severe maternal and fetal or neonatal mortality, it was associated with a significant amount of perinatal mortality and perturbations of pup development. Pups developed physical dependence to both drugs, as evidenced by the ability of naloxone challenge to precipitate withdrawal. Both drugs induced tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine in the tail-flick test. The effects of buprenorphine varied with the dose used, and the highest dose did not always produce the greatest effect. There were some similarities between the effects of perinatal buprenorphine and perinatal methadone; however, differences were also observed between the effects of the two drugs, which may be related to the different affinities and efficacies of the drugs at different opioid receptor subtypes.
The treatment of anosmia has changed minimally since the early 1970s, despite dramatic advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of olfaction. Recent studies from the authors' laboratory have suggested that most common causes of clinical olfactory dysfunction, including rhinosinusitis, appear to be associated with increased apoptotic death of olfactory sensory neurons. This appears to result in a decline in the number of functioning mature olfactory sensory neurons, despite the capacity of the olfactory epithelium for regeneration. The current study evaluated the ability of the antibiotic minocycline to inhibit olfactory sensory neuron apoptosis. This drug is known to inhibit apoptosis separate from its anti-infective properties. Olfactory sensory neuron apoptosis was triggered by surgical deafferentation ("bulbectomy"), the standard experimental model. Earlier studies have indicated that bulbectomy and sinusitis invoke similar proteolytic enzyme cascades in olfactory sensory neurons.
Histological analysis of animal olfactory tissue.
Mice underwent unilateral olfactory bulbectomy to induce apoptotic olfactory sensory neuron death, with and without 45 mg/kg intraperitoneal minocycline given 12 hours before surgery and every 12 hours until death. Mice were killed at 2 and 4 days after bulbectomy and assessed for activation of capsase-3 and olfactory sensory neuron survival by immunohistochemical analysis.
Minocycline resulted in partial suppression of cell death at 2 days after surgery when compared with untreated animals.
Minocycline inhibits olfactory sensory neuron death in the face of a potent pro-apoptotic stimulus. This drug is well tolerated and is currently undergoing human trials for the management of a variety of neurological disorders associated with apoptosis. The current results suggest that minocycline may be efficacious in the management of peripheral olfactory loss as well.
Chorioamnionitis is the most significant source of prenatal inflammation and preterm delivery. Prematurity and prenatal inflammation are associated with compromised postnatal developmental outcomes, of the intestinal immune defence, gut barrier function and the vascular system. We developed a sheep model to study how the antenatal development of the gut was affected by gestation and/or by endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis.Chorioamnionitis was induced at different gestational ages (GA). Animals were sacrificed at low GA after 2d or 14d exposure to chorioamnionitis. Long term effects of 30d exposure to chorioamnionitis were studied in near term animals after induction of chorioamnionitis. The cellular distribution of tight junction protein ZO-1 was shown to be underdeveloped at low GA whereas endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis prevented the maturation of tight junctions during later gestation. Endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis did not induce an early (2d) inflammatory response in the gut in preterm animals. However, 14d after endotoxin administration preterm animals had increased numbers of T-lymphocytes, myeloperoxidase-positive cells and gammadelta T-cells which lasted till 30d after induction of chorioamnionitis in then near term animals. At early GA, low intestinal TLR-4 and MD-2 mRNA levels were detected which were further down regulated during endotoxin-induced chorioamnionitis. Predisposition to organ injury by ischemia was assessed by the vascular function of third-generation mesenteric arteries. Endotoxin-exposed animals of low GA had increased contractile response to the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619 and reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in responses to acetylcholine. The administration of a nitric oxide (NO) donor completely restored endothelial dysfunction suggesting reduced NO bioavailability which was not due to low expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.Our results indicate that the distribution of the tight junctional protein ZO-1, the immune defence and vascular function are immature at low GA and are further compromised by endotoxin-induced chorioamnionitis. This study suggests that both prematurity and inflammation in utero disturb fetal gut development, potentially predisposing to postnatal intestinal pathology.
Natural leaching processes and/or anthropogenic contamination can result in ground water concentrations of the essential metal manganese (Mn) that far exceed the current regulatory standards. Neurological consequences of Mn drinking water (DW) overexposure to experimental animals, i.e., mice, including its brain deposition/distribution and behavioral effects are understudied. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to Mn via the DW for 8 weeks. After 5 weeks of Mn exposure, magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant Mn deposition in all examined brain regions; the degree of Mn deposition did not increase further a week later. Behaviorally, early hyperactivity and more time spent in the center of the arenas in an open field test, decreased forelimb grip strength and less time swimming in a forced swim test were observed after 6 weeks of Mn DW exposure. Eight-week Mn DW exposure did not alter striatal dopamine, its metabolites, or the expression of key dopamine homeostatic proteins, but it significantly increased striatal 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a serotonin metabolite) levels, without affecting the levels of serotonin itself. Increased expression (mRNA) of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, an astrocyte activation marker), heme oxygenase-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (oxidative and nitrosative stress markers, respectively) were observed 8 weeks post-Mn DW exposure in the substantia nigra. Besides mRNA increases, GFAP protein expression was increased in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. In summary, the neurobehavioral deficits, characterized by locomotor and emotional perturbations, and nigral glial activation associated with significant brain Mn deposition are among the early signs of Mn neurotoxicity caused by DW overexposure.
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is known to induce lung toxicity, including terminal bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia, which gives rise to concerns that nanosized ZnO (nZnO) might lead to lung carcinogenesis. We studied the tumor promoting activity of nZnO by an initiation-promotion protocol using human c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene transgenic rats (Hras128 rats). The rats were given 0.2 % N-nitrosobis(2-hydroxypropyl)amine (DHPN) in the drinking water for 2 weeks and then treated with 0.5 ml of 250 or 500 μg/ml nZnO suspension by intra-pulmonary spraying once every 2 weeks for a total of 7 times. Treatment with nZnO particles did not promote DHPN-induced lung carcinogenesis. However, nZnO dose-dependently caused epithelial hyperplasia of terminal bronchioles (EHTB) and fibrosis-associated interstitial pneumonitis (FAIP) that were independent of DHPN treatment. Tracing the fate of EHTB lesions in wild-type rats indicated that the hyperplastic lesions almost completely disappeared within 12 weeks after the last nZnO treatment. Since nZnO particles were not found in the lung and ZnCl2 solution induced similar lung lesions and gene expression profiles, the observed lesions were most likely caused by dissolved Zn(2+). In summary, nZnO did not promote carcinogenesis in the lung and induced EHTB and FAIP lesions that regressed rapidly, probably due to clearance of surplus Zn(2+) from the lung.
Cells from patients with t(15;17) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) express the fusion protein between the promyelocytic leukemia protein and retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RAR alpha). Patients with APL respond to differentiation therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid, which induces PML/RAR alpha degradation. When resistance to all-trans-retinoic acid develops, an effective treatment is arsenic trioxide (arsenite), which also induces this degradation. We investigated the mechanism of arsenite-induced PML/RAR alpha degradation.
NB4-S1 APL cells were treated with clinically relevant concentrations of arsenite. Lysosomes were visualized with a lysosome-specific dye. Lysosomal protein esterase was measured by immunoblot analysis. Lysosomal cathepsin L was detected by immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopy, and its activity was measured in cytosolic cellular fractions. In vitro degradation assays of PML/RAR alpha in cell lysates were performed with and without protease inhibitors and assessed by immunoblot analysis. Only nonparametric two-sided statistical analyses were used. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used for group comparison, and the nonlinear regression technique was used for analysis of dose-response relationship as a function of arsenite concentration.
Arsenite treatment destabilized lysosomes in APL cells. Lysosomal proteases, including cathepsin L, were released from lysosomes 5 minutes to 6 hours after arsenite treatment. PML/RAR alpha was degraded by lysate from arsenite-treated APL cells, and the degradation was inhibited by protease inhibitors. At both 6 and 24 hours, substantially fewer arsenite-treated APL cells, than untreated cells, contained cathepsin L clusters, a reflection of cathepsin L delocalization. Cells with cathepsin L clusters decreased as a function of arsenite concentration at rates of -2.03% (95% confidence interval [CI] = -4.01 to -.045; P = .045) and -2.39% (95% CI = -4.54 to -.024; P = .029) in 6- and 24-hour treatment groups, respectively, per 1.0 microM increase in arsenite concentration. Statistically significantly higher cytosolic cathepsin L activity was detected in lysates of arsenite-treated APL cells than in control lysates. For example, the mean increase in cathepsin activity at 6 hours and 1.0 microM arsenite was 26.3% (95% CI = 3.3% to 33%; P < .001), compared with untreated cells.
In APL cells, arsenite may cause rapid destabilization of lysosomes.
The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal dose of remifentanil for minimizing hemodynamic changes during intubation and reducing propofol-induced pain in elderly patients.
In a randomized prospective study, 60 patients (ASA I-II, elder than 65 years) were enrolled to determine which of two target remifentanil blood concentrations (3 ng/ml, 5 ng/ml) was required to blunt hemodynamic changes during intubation and to reduce propofol-induced pain. After the target effect site concentration of remifentanil had been reached, the target controlled infusion of propofol was started and propofol-induced pain was recorded. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at baseline, just before intubation and 1, 3, 5 min after intubation.
There were no significant differences in the hemodynamic parameters between two groups, but not in arterial pressure at just before intubation and 1 minute after intubation. However, the group R5 (5 ng/ml) showed significantly less intense pain induced by propofol than in the group R3 (3 ng/ml).
The results suggest that the group R5 provide more relief in propofol induced pain than the group R3, but showed great possibility of hypotension and bradycardia in both groups, which means it should be used with cautions in the elderly patients.
Recently, we demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) ligand ameliorates cisplatin-induced acute renal failure (ARF) by preventing inhibition of substrate oxidation, and also by preventing apoptosis and necrosis of the proximal tubule (Li S, Bhatt R, Megyesi J, Gokden N, Shah SV, and Portilla D. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 287: F990-F998, 2004). In the following studies, we examined the protective effect of PPARalpha ligand on cisplatin-induced inflammatory responses during ARF. Mice subjected to a single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin developed ARF at day 3. Cisplatin increased mRNA and protein expression of TNF-alpha, RANTES, and also upregulated endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1/VCAM-1 and chemokine receptors CCR1/CCR5. Cisplatin also led to neutrophil infiltration in the corticomedullary region. Pretreatment of wild-type mice with WY-14,643, a fibrate class of PPARalpha ligands, before cisplatin significantly suppressed cisplatin-induced upregulation of cytokine/chemokine expression, prevented neutrophil accumulation, and ameliorated renal dysfunction. In contrast, treatment with PPARalpha ligand before cisplatin did not prevent cytokine/chemokine production, neutrophil accumulation, and did not protect kidney function in PPARalpha null mice. In addition, we observed that cisplatin-induced NF-kappaB binding activity in nuclear extracts from wild-type mice was markedly reduced by treatment with PPARalpha ligand. These results demonstrate that PPARalpha exerts an anti-inflammatory effect in kidney tissue by a mechanism that includes inhibition of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, and this effect results in inhibition of neutrophil infiltration, cytokine/chemokine release, and amelioration of cisplatin-induced ARF.
Glucocorticoids are known to acutely increase blood pressure, suppress inflammation, and precipitate insulin resistance. However, the short-term effects of glucocorticoids on other cardiovascular risk factors remain incompletely characterized.
Our objective was to determine the effects of a short course of dexamethasone on multiple cardiovascular biomarkers and to determine whether suppression of morning cortisol in response to low-dose dexamethasone is correlated with cardiovascular risk markers in healthy volunteers.
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
The study took place in a tertiary care hospital.
Twenty-five healthy male volunteers, ages 19-39 yr, participated in the study.
Subjects received either 3 mg dexamethasone twice daily or placebo for 5 d. Subjects also underwent a low-dose (0.5 mg) overnight dexamethasone suppression test.
Parameters examined before and after the 5-d intervention included heart rate, blood pressure, weight, fasting lipid variables, homocysteine, renin, aldosterone, insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, B-type natriuretic peptide, flow-mediated and nitroglycerin-mediated brachial artery dilatation, and heart rate recovery after exercise. All measurements were done in the morning hours in the fasting state.
Dexamethasone increased systolic blood pressure, weight, B-type natriuretic peptide, and high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol. Dexamethasone decreased resting heart rate, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and aldosterone and tended to attenuate nitroglycerin-mediated vasodilatation. There was no effect on flow-mediated vasodilatation, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol, nonesterified fatty acids, homocysteine, or heart rate recovery. The response of circulating cortisol to low-dose dexamethasone had no significant correlation with any of the cardiovascular risk markers.
Short-term glucocorticoids elicits both favorable and unfavorable effects on different cardiovascular risk factors. Manipulation of specific glucocorticoid-responsive physiological pathways deserves further study.
Different studies published in the last years have focused on the psychotropic effects of carbamazepine (CBZ). This study tried to investigate the efficacity of CBZ as an adjunct treatment of schizophrenia. 20 patients with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, according to the RDC, have been investigated by double-blind method. Subjects are divided in two groups (n = 10). The first one is treated with CBZ (with dose in order to reach a plasma level between 8-12 mg/l) and haloperidol (oral fixed dose: 30 mg/day). The second group only with haloperidol (same dose). Clinical and psychopathological disturbances are evaluated with the BPRS, and secondary effects with the UKU scale. A clinical improvement (greater than 70%, measured by the BPRS) was observed for both groups, without significant differences. Patients treated with CBZ show an important reduction of neurological secondary effects related to neuroleptics (haloperidol). Carbamazepine appears to be a useful treatment, combined with neuroleptics, for acute schizophrenic episodes.
Chronic exposure to low levels of lead causes hypertension (HTN) that is, in part, due to increased inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The latter results in functional NO deficiency and compensatory up-regulation of NO synthase (NOS). We have previously shown evidence for increased hydroxyl radical (*OH) activity in rats with lead-induced HTN. Since in the biological systems *OH is primarily derived from superoxide (O2*) we hypothesize that lead-induced oxidative stress and HTN must be due to increased O2* production and as such could be ameliorated by administration of a cell-permeable O2* scavenger. We, therefore, studied the effects of the superoxide dismutase (SOD)-mimetic drug tempol (15 mmol/kg/day i.p. x 2 weeks) and placebo in lead-exposed (given lead acetate, 100 ppm in the drinking water for 12 weeks) and normal control rats. Lead exposure resulted in a marked elevation of blood pressure, a significant reduction in urinary NO metabolites (NO(chi)) excretion, and up-regulations of endothelial and inducible NOS abundance in the kidney, aorta, and heart and of neuronal NOS in the cerebral cortex and brain stem. Administration of tempol ameliorated HTN, increased urinary NO(chi) excretion, and reversed the compensatory up-regulation of NOS isoforms in rats with lead-induced HTN. These abnormalities recurred within 2 wk after discontinuation of tempol. In contrast to the lead-exposed rats, the normal control rats showed no change in either blood pressure, urinary NO(chi) excretion, or tissue NOS expression in response to either administration or discontinuation of tempol. Thus, the study supports the presence of increased O2* activity and its role in the pathogenesis of HTN and altered NO metabolism in lead-exposed animals.
To refine 1974 results on venous thrombosis and oral contraceptives (OCs) from a prospective study begun in 1968 comparing 23,000 women using OCs with 23,000 controls, women with known preexisting conditions relevant to thrombosis were excluded. Rates in each contraceptive category (users, ex-users, and controls) were indirectly standardized for age, parity, cigarette consumption, and social class. The relative risk (users to nonusers) of deep vein thrombosis was 4.17; for superficial vein thrombosis, it was 2.41. For other thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, trends were similar but the differences were not significant. Rates of ex-users did not differ significantly from the controls, implying no persistent risk after OC use ends. Superficial thrombosis correlated significantly with age, parity, and estrogen dose and progesterone content of OCs, but deep vein thrombosis did not. The risk of superficial thrombosis was significantly increased in users and nonusers with severe varicose veins, and increased with the severity; no significant relationship was found with deep vein thrombosis.
Although 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is a potent cell-differentiating agent, its use in cancer prevention or therapy is precluded because it induces hypercalcemia. Synthetic analogs have been developed which inhibit tumor progression in animal models of breast cancer. One analog, Seocalcitol (EB1089) has been shown to be effective in causing regression of N-methyl-nitrosourea-induced rat mammary tumors. However, at the most effective oral dose, a significant increase in serum and urinary calcium levels were observed. In order to compare the efficacy of different dosing schedules of Seocalcitol, rats were treated either 6 times weekly (1 microg/kg) or by intermittent dosing to achieve the same total weekly dose. All dosing schedules of Seocalcitol were effective in inhibiting tumor progression. Once daily dosing was significantly more effective than intermittent dosing but was associated with a greater rise in serum calcium concentration. In order to evaluate alternative treatment strategies to limit calcemic effects, we assessed the efficacy of limiting vitamin D-induced hypercalcemia using bisphosphonates. Seocalcitol (2.5 microg/kg daily p.o. for 4 weeks) alone and in combination with pamidronate (APD 0.4 mg/kg per day s.c.) or the same dose of the bisphosphonate EB 1053 caused substantial tumor regression. No statistically significant difference was seen between combination treatment and Seocalcitol treatment alone. Co-treatment with APD or EB 1053 did not limit the rise in serum calcium induced by Seocalcitol alone. Cessation of treatment or administration of a lower dose (1microg/kg twice weekly) reversed hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and weight loss induced by high dose Seocalcitol. However, reduction in tumor volume was maintained in the majority of animals.
Rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer of skeletal muscle lineage, is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children. Major subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma include alveolar (ARMS) and embryonal (ERMS) tumors. Whereas ARMS tumors typically contain translocations generating PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 fusions that block terminal myogenic differentiation, no functionally comparable genetic event has been found in ERMS tumors. Here we report the discovery, through whole-exome sequencing, of a recurrent somatic mutation encoding p.Leu122Arg in the myogenic transcription factor MYOD1 in a distinct subset of ERMS tumors with poor outcomes that also often contain mutations altering PI3K-AKT pathway components. Previous mutagenesis studies had shown that MYOD1 with a p.Leu122Arg substitution can block wild-type MYOD1 function and bind to MYC consensus sequences, suggesting a possible switch from differentiation to proliferation. Our functional data now confirm this prediction. Thus, MYOD1 p.Leu122Arg defines a subset of rhabdomyosarcomas eligible for high-risk protocols and the development of targeted therapeutics.
We investigated the influence of long-term treatment with supraphysiological doses of an anabolic-androgenic steroid on the Bezold-Jarisch reflex (BJR) control of heart rate (HR) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and whether this treatment induced cardiac hypertrophy. Male rats were treated with nandrolone decanoate (ND) (10 mg kg(-1) body weight for 8 weeks; DECA) or vehicle (control animals; CON). After 8 weeks of treatment, the BJR was evaluated by bradycardia and hypotension responses that were elicited by serotonin administration (2-32 microg kg(-1)). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was assessed and cardiac hypertrophy was determined by the ratio of the left and right ventricle weight/body weight (LVW/BW and RVW/BW, respectively) and by histological analysis. Total body protein (TBP) content was also evaluated. Nandrolone decanoate treatment increased MAP (CON=99+/- 1 mmHg; DECA=109+/-2 mmHg; p<0.01) but did not change the mean basal HR (CON=356+/-13 bpm; DECA=367+/-11 bpm). The treatment also induced LV and RV hypertrophy (LVW/BW: CON=1.86+/-0.04 mg g(-1), DECA=2.17+/-0.04 mg g(-1), p<0.01; RVW/BW: CON=0.42+/-0.02 mg g(-1), DECA=0.53+/-0.03 mg g(-1), p<0.05) and reduced the number of myocyte nuclei/high-power field (CON=23.0+/-2; DECA=9.4+/-1.0; p<0.01). ND treatment blunted the HR and DAP decreases induced by serotonin. ND determines an increase in the TBP content in DECA group (35+/-3%; p<0.01) compared with control animals (18+/-1%). We conclude that 8 weeks of ND treatment induces anabolic effect, cardiac hypertrophy and an elevation of MAP. This treatment also reduces the sensitivity of the BJR control of bradycardia and blood pressure, possibly due to cardiac hypertrophy. The blunted BJR response could contribute to the MAP elevation in DECA animals.
Verapamil-sensitive left ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) configuration and left-axis deviation has been demonstrated to arise from the left posterior fascicle, and can be cured by catheter ablation guided by Purkinje potentials. Verapamil-sensitive VT with an RBBB configuration and right-axis deviation is rare, and may originate in the left anterior fascicle.
Six patients (five men and one woman, mean age 54+/-15 years) with a history of sustained VT with an RBBB configuration and right-axis deviation underwent electrophysiologic study and radiofrequency (RF) ablation. VT was slowed and terminated by intravenous administration of verapamil in all six patients. Left ventricular endocardial mapping during VT identified the earliest ventricular activation in the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle in all patients. RF current delivered to this site suppressed the VT in three patients (ablation at the VT exit). The fused Purkinje potential was recorded at that site, and preceded the QRS complex by 35, 30, and 20 msec, with pace mapping showing an optimal match between the paced rhythm and the clinical VT. In the remaining three patients, RF catheter ablation at the site of the earliest ventricular activation was unsuccessful. In these three patients, Purkinje potential was recorded in the diastolic phase during VT at the mid-anterior left ventricular septum. The Purkinje potential preceded the QRS during VT by 66, 56, and 63 msec, and catheter ablation at these sites was successful (ablation at the zone of slow conduction). During 19 to 46 months of follow-up (mean 32+/-9 months), one patient in the group of ablation at the VT exit had sustained VT with a left bundle branch block configuration and an inferior axis, and one patient in the group of ablation at the zone of slow conduction experienced typical idiopathic VT with an RBBB configuration and left-axis deviation.
Verapamil-sensitive VT with an RBBB configuration and right-axis deviation originates close to the anterior fascicle. RF catheter ablation can be performed successfully from the VT exit site or the zone of slow conduction where the Purkinje potential was recorded in the diastolic phase.
The effect of metoclopramide on plasma prolactin levels was studied in 10 women in the second half of pregnancy. The IV injection of 10 mg metoclopramide produces a significant rise in prolactin in 15 minutes, a peak of up to 6.5-fold over basal levels at 30 minutes and a sustained significant elevation for at least 4 hours. The results of this study indicate that maternal plasma protein levels although elevated, are still under inhibitory control and that the prolactin releasing capacity of the pituitary is maintained during pregnancy. The elevated hyperprolactinemia induced by metoclopramide may be of help in investigating the role of prolactin in human pregnancy.
A trial is described of new therapeutic approaches in treatment-resistant chronic depression. Phenelzine, L-tryptophan and lithium ("5HT-cocktail") was used as the major pharmacological strategy, and a regime aimed at reducing vanadium concentrations was added in the second part of the trial. Patients were randomly assigned to cognitive behaviour therapy in addition. All but 1 of the patients who ultimately entered the trial were unipolar depressives; 2 bipolar patients were withdrawn in the initial drug-free period because of the development of mixed affective states. Eleven of 20 patients showed an improvement to less than 50% of their initial scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and all those who improved did so in the first 6 weeks. Cognitive behaviour therapy did not seem to influence the response, but it is recognized that the short duration of therapy may be inadequate in these circumstances. It is suggested that intensive drug treatment is a necessary preliminary in management and may allow the effective use of rehabilitation aimed at the secondary handicaps of chronic depression.
Many common human mesenchymal tumors, including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS), feature myogenic differentiation. Here we report that intragenic deletion of the dystrophin-encoding and muscular dystrophy-associated DMD gene is a frequent mechanism by which myogenic tumors progress to high-grade, lethal sarcomas. Dystrophin is expressed in the non-neoplastic and benign counterparts of GIST, RMS and LMS tumors, and DMD deletions inactivate larger dystrophin isoforms, including 427-kDa dystrophin, while preserving the expression of an essential 71-kDa isoform. Dystrophin inhibits myogenic sarcoma cell migration, invasion, anchorage independence and invadopodia formation, and dystrophin inactivation was found in 96%, 100% and 62% of metastatic GIST, embryonal RMS and LMS samples, respectively. These findings validate dystrophin as a tumor suppressor and likely anti-metastatic factor, suggesting that therapies in development for muscular dystrophies may also have relevance in the treatment of cancer.
