The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor complex and its downstream signaling intermediates constitute a tumor suppressor pathway. In many cancers, expression of TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaR-II) is markedly decreased. In the present study, we show that the hepatocytes isolated from 15-day-old, but not 9-month-old, mice heterozygous for the deletion of the TbetaR-II gene are slightly less sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-beta when compared with wild-type littermates of same age. In addition, the proliferation index of hepatocytes as indicated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation is mildly increased in the heterozygous mice. These subtle changes in cellular phenotype did not result in either gross or microscopic abnormality of the liver. The treatment of these mice with the chemical carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine, results in a significantly enhanced tumorigenesis in the liver when compared with the wild-type littermates. Our results demonstrate the gene-dosage effect of TbetaR-II and indicate that the reduced expression of TbetaR-II in mice increases susceptibility to tumorigenesis in the liver.
Hypersensitivity to rectal or colonic distension characterizes most patients with IBS and increased gut permeability has been described in post-dysenteric IBS patients. However, no link has been established between these two events. The aim of this study was to determine (i) whether chemical blockade of stress-induced increase of colonic paracellular permeability by 2,4,6 triaminopyrimidine (TAP) affects the concomitant hypersensitivity to colonic distension, (ii) the role of epithelial cell contraction in the stress-induced increased permeability and hyperalgesia, using a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor (ML-7). The effect of acute partial restraint stress (PRS) on visceral sensitivity to colorectal distension (RD) was assessed by abdominal muscle electromyography. Colonic paracellular permeability was determined by measuring percentage of urinary 51Cr-EDTA recovery after intracolonic infusion. The effect of stress on both parameters was evaluated after TAP, ML-7 or vehicle pretreated animals. PRS significantly increased colonic paracellular permeability and the number of spike bursts for all volumes of RD applied compared to sham. TAP suppressed the stress-induced increase of colonic paracellular permeability and sensitivity to colonic distension. Similarly, ML-7 blocked the stress-induced increase of colonic paracellular permeability and sensitivity. Neither ML-7 nor TAP had any effect on both permeability and sensitivity in absence of stress. The increase of colonic permeability induced by PRS results from epithelial cell cytoskeleton contraction through myosin light chain kinase activation and this increase is responsible for stress-induced rectal hypersensitivity.
A 2.8-year-old female patient (11.6 kg) was admitted to the hospital for uncontrolled pain and swelling in the left leg relating to a metastatic neuroblastoma. Initially, her pain was managed with oral morphine 2 mg (approx. 0.2 mg/kg) every 4 hours. Because she was quite somnolent but still in significant pain, analgesia was then changed to methadone 1 mg orally every 6 hours (approximately 0.1 mg/kg/dose) and was eventually increased over 36 hours to 2 mg every 6 hours (approximately 0.2 mg/kg/dose). She received oral methadone 0.6 mg (approximately 0.05 mg/kg) every 4 hours as needed for breakthrough pain. She continued to have severe pain and experienced side effects, including respiratory depression, sedation, visual hallucinations, and vomiting. An intravenous ketamine infusion was started at 100 microg/kg/hour. Regular opioid administration was ceased, but she was given intravenous morphine 0.5 to 0.75 mg for breakthrough pain. She required only zero to three doses of breakthrough morphine per day, initially. After starting the ketamine infusion, her pain control improved and her symptoms of opioid toxicity abated. She was more alert and able to partake in limited activities. As a result of pain from progressive disease, the ketamine infusion was increased to 200 microg/kg/hour after 6 days with positive results. Her condition continued to deteriorate. An intravenous morphine infusion was initiated 2 weeks after starting the ketamine infusion and was eventually increased to 50 microg/kg/hour. One week later, she died with reasonable pain control. This case illustrates the use of ketamine as an effective analgesic in an adjuvant setting in a pediatric patient with advanced poorly controlled cancer pain. Ketamine not only eased the child's suffering while preserving life but also improved her quality of life by maintaining the child's ability to communicate and engage in activities.
Toward the goal of defining new pharmacological targets for the treatment of chronic pain conditions, in previous studies we established a model, termed 'hyperalgesic priming,' in which an acute inflammatory stimulus causes a long-lasting latent susceptibility to hyperalgesia induced by subsequent exposures to the inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Those investigations suggested the hypothesis that priming induces a novel linkage between the PGE2-activated second messenger cascade and the epsilon isoform of protein kinase C (PKCepsilon). In the present study, comparison of dose-response relations for hyperalgesia produced by PGE2, forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, or the protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit, in primed versus normal animals, demonstrated that priming-induced enhancement of the PGE2-activated second messenger cascade occurs downstream to adenylate cyclase and upstream to PKA. Therefore, PGE2-induced hyperalgesia in the primed animal is enhanced by the recruitment of a novel cAMP/PKCepsilon signaling pathway in addition to the usual cAMP/PKA pathway. These observations suggest that pharmacological disruption of the novel interaction between cAMP and PKCepsilon might provide a route toward the development of highly specific methods to reverse cellular processes that underlie chronic pain states.
Cocaine usage goes back thousands of years, to the times of the Incas. Over the past 20 years, its use has increased dramatically, especially in America, and adverse cardiovascular reactions to the drug have begun to be reported. The first report of myocardial infarction temporally related to the recreational use of cocaine appeared in 1982. Since then, myocardial infarction has become recognized as the drug's most common cardiovascular consequence, with over 250 cases now documented in the literature. This review discusses the history of cocaine use, its pharmacology, the possible pathological mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of myocardial ischaemia and infarction, and current ideas on the management of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction.
Acetaminophen [N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP)] is the most common antipyretic/analgesic medicine worldwide. If APAP is overdosed, its metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinoneimine (NAPQI), causes liver damage. However, epidemiological evidence has associated previous use of therapeutic APAP doses with the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. The transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) channel is expressed by peptidergic primary sensory neurons. Because NAPQI, like other TRPA1 activators, is an electrophilic molecule, we hypothesized that APAP, via NAPQI, stimulates TRPA1, thus causing airway neurogenic inflammation. NAPQI selectively excites human recombinant and native (neuroblastoma cells) TRPA1. TRPA1 activation by NAPQI releases proinflammatory neuropeptides (substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) from sensory nerve terminals in rodent airways, thereby causing neurogenic edema and neutrophilia. Single or repeated administration of therapeutic (15-60 mg/kg) APAP doses to mice produces detectable levels of NAPQI in the lung, and increases neutrophil numbers, myeloperoxidase activity, and cytokine and chemokine levels in the airways or skin. Inflammatory responses evoked by NAPQI and APAP are abated by TRPA1 antagonism or are absent in TRPA1-deficient mice. This novel pathway, distinguished from the tissue-damaging effect of NAPQI, may contribute to the risk of COPD and asthma associated with therapeutic APAP use.
In the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulation, an increase in the migration/invasion of U87 glioblastoma cells was detected by a wound healing assay, transwell analysis, and spheroid formation assay by inducing matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) enzyme activity via a gelatin zymographic analysis. A dose- and time-dependent increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression with elevated prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production was identified in TPA- but not in 4alpha-TPA (a respective inactive compound)-treated U87 cells TPA-induced migration/invasion was significantly blocked by adding the COX-2-specific inhibitor, NS398, through a reduction in PGE(2) production. Data from the pharmacological studies using specific chemical inhibitors showed that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) was involved in TPA-induced migration/invasion, COX-2 protein expression, and MMP-9 activation. Stimulation of intracellular peroxide production by TPA was detected by a DCHF-DA assay, and the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or tempol significantly inhibited TPA-induced migration/invasion and COX-2 protein expression accompanied by a decrease in peroxide production. An increase in NADPH oxidase activity by TPA was examined, and TPA-induced migration/invasion was blocked by adding DPI, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. Additionally, the natural flavonoids quercetin (QE), baicalein (BE), and myricetin (ME) effectively blocked TPA-induced migration/invasion while simultaneously inhibiting COX-2/PGE(2) production, MMP-9 enzyme activity, and peroxide production in U87 cells. The contribution of ROS production to the migration/invasion of U87 glioblastoma cells via ERK-activated COX-2/PGE(2) and MMP-9 induction was first investigated here, and agents such as QE, BE, and ME with the ability to block these events possess the potential to be developed for use against migration/invasion by glioblastomas.
Indinavir, a protease inhibitor that is commonly used to treat HIV infection, may cause crystal formation within the renal tubules when urine pH is above 3.5. Crystallization in the urine may lead to intrarenal crystal deposition and acute renal failure (ARF).
To establish the beneficial urological management of acute renal failure caused by indinavir treatment of HIV/AIDS patients.
Five HIV positive patients (four men, one woman) with a mean age of 32 years (range 28-36 years) were referred to our Department of Urology from an AIDS outpatient Clinic, because of the development of postrenal acute renal failure with continuously elevated creatinine and urea plasma levels after indinavir therapy. Among the initial therapeutic maneuvers, indinavir administration was interrupted for 1 week while bilateral double-J ureteral stents were inserted in all the HIV/AIDS patients, during the first 24-72 h to secure upper-tract drainage. Concurrently urine has been acidified by oral administration of the amino acid L: -methionine and oral fluid intake was increased.
All the patients responded well to the treatment and their renal function was effortlessly restored to normal within a few days.
HIV-positive patients receiving indinavir therapy might be complicated by acute renal failure, mainly due to intrarenal crystal deposition (tubules) or urolithiasis (postrenal obstruction). This adverse effect may simply manage by the discontinuation of indinavir administration, urine acidification, as well as the possible early insertion of bilateral double-J ureteral stents.
Multiple pterygium syndromes (MPSs) comprise a group of multiple-congenital-anomaly disorders characterized by webbing (pterygia) of the neck, elbows, and/or knees and joint contractures (arthrogryposis). In addition, a variety of developmental defects (e.g., vertebral anomalies) may occur. MPSs are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous but are traditionally divided into prenatally lethal and nonlethal (Escobar) types. To elucidate the pathogenesis of MPS, we undertook a genomewide linkage scan of a large consanguineous family and mapped a locus to 2q36-37. We then identified germline-inactivating mutations in the embryonal acetylcholine receptor gamma subunit (CHRNG) in families with both lethal and nonlethal MPSs. These findings extend the role of acetylcholine receptor dysfunction in human disease and provide new insights into the pathogenesis and management of fetal akinesia syndromes.
Baclofen, an agonist at GABAB receptors injected locally into the rat ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM) induced catalepsy in a dose-dependent, stereospecific and site-specific way. Baclofen-induced catalepsy was accompanied by tonic activity in the electromyogram (EMG) recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle, which is considered to be a measure of limb rigidity. delta-Aminovalerate (delta-AVA) coadministered with baclofen into the VM prevented the development of both catalepsy and limb rigidity. delta-AVA injected alone into the VM was devoid of depressant or stimulating behavioral effects. In contrast to delta-AVA, bicuculline, a GABAA antagonist, failed to antagonize baclofen-induced catalepsy. On the other hand, catalepsy due to local injection of a GABAA agonist, muscimol into the VM was antagonized by bicuculline, but not by delta-AVA. The present results suggest that delta-AVA may be useful as an antagonist of central pharmacological actions of baclofen.
A bipolar patient with renal angiosclerosis due to lithium intoxication showed convulsive crises for about four months after each haemodialysis session. Aetiological work up was not able to isolate a unique cause, but modifications in treatment relieved the symptoms.
One ultimate goal of hypertension therapy is to cause permanent reversal ("regression") of already established hypertension. Our aim was to examine whether high-dose "pulse" treatment with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor could cause regression of established hypertension and to link this action to reversal of arteriolar hypertrophy and changes in vascular matrix metalloproteinase activities. First, 16-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (n=60) were pulse treated for 2 weeks with high-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), angiotensin receptor blocker (candesartan), calcium channel blocker (nifedipine), or vasodilator (hydralazine) with or without salt restriction, and the long-term effects on blood pressure were examined. Second, spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with angiotensin receptor blocker or calcium channel blocker, and the effects on renal gene expressions, arteriolar structure, and vascular matrix metalloproteinase were compared. Treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with different antihypertensive agents caused apparently similar reductions in blood pressure during the course of the pulse treatment, within the limitations of the tail-cuff method. After cessation of medications, blood pressure in the rats treated with renin-angiotensin system inhibitor remained reduced by >30 to 40 mm Hg for 4 months. No such effect was seen with calcium channel blocker or vasodilator. The 2-week angiotensin receptor blocker treatment induced a marked reversal of the arteriolar hypertrophy specifically in the small (30 to 100 microm) renal arterioles, together with increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-13. In conclusion, transient high-dose pulse treatment with angiotensin receptor blocker caused changes in vascular matrix metalloproteinase activity, specific reversal of renal arteriolar hypertrophy, and regression of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
We have hypothesized that genetic predisposition influences the progression of SARS. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE1) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism was previously reported to show association with the adult respiratory distress syndrome, which is also thought to play a key role in damaging the lung tissues in SARS cases. This time, the polymorphism was genotyped in 44 Vietnamese SARS cases, with 103 healthy controls who had had a contact with the SARS patients and 50 controls without any contact history. SARS cases were divided into either non-hypoxemic or hypoxemic groups. Despite the small sample size, the frequency of the D allele was significantly higher in the hypoxemic group than in the non-hypoxemic group (p=0.013), whereas there was no significant difference between the SARS cases and controls, irrespective of a contact history. ACE1 might be one of the candidate genes that influence the progression of pneumonia in SARS.
A case of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)--induced haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) after liver transplantation leading to irreversible renal failure is described.
We present case history of 25-years old male after liver transplantation due to cryptogenic cirrhosis with prolonged worsening graft function, who developed HUS. Unsatisfactory graft function was the reason of performing numerous graft biopsies. Features of acute and chronic rejection (CR) of liver were histopathologically confirmed. Vanishing bile duct syndrome as manifestation of CR was stated and immunosuppressive regimen was intensified (tacrolimus placed cyclosporin). High blood levels of tacrolimus were maintained (approximately 20-22 ng/ml) on dose 3 mg twice a day. No clinical effect was observed. Renal failure was improving (serum creatinine was 3.3 mg/dl and eGFR was 24 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). After four months of maintaining high dose of tacrolimus patient was referred to our center in order to estimate indications for liver retransplantation. On admission severe haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure were detected. Atypical HUS probably related to CNI was diagnosed. Tacrolimus administration was discontinued. Blood and plasma transfusion as well as plasmapheresis were implemented. Haemolysis was limited, but renal function was not improved. Renal biopsy revealed features of irreversible nephropathy in course of thrombotic microangiopathy. Despite previously maintaining high dose of CNI, there were no signs of CNI nephrotoxicity. Patient required haemodialysis. Due to necessity of haemodialysis and worsening function of liver, patient was accepted to liver and kidney transplantation.
High CNI blood concentration in patient after liver transplantation can be atypical cause of HUS and leads to irreversible renal failure.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether dityrosine and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) reflect the severity of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Immunoexpression of dityrosine in kidneys and plasma AOPP concentration were examined up to day 4 post-cisplatin injection in rats. Cisplatin injection induced tubular injury on days 2-4 after injection and increased serum creatinine and BUN on days 3 and 4. On days 2-4, dityrosine was immunostained in the cytoplasm of damaged tubular cells, and their immunostaining intensity increased time-dependently. Plasma AOPP levels were significantly increased on days 3 and 4. These results suggest that expressions of dityrosine and AOPP were associated with the severity of renal injury and may be useful markers for the development of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.
To investigate the neuroprotective effect and mechanisms of scutellarin, a flavonoid extracted from Erigeron breviscapus Hand Mazz, against neuronal damage following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
Rats were pretreated ig with scutellarin for 7 d and then subjected to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The infarct volume and neurological deficit were determined by TTC staining and Longa's score. The permeability of the blood-brain barrier was evaluated by measurement of the Evans blue (EB) content in the brain with a spectrophotometer. The total NOx content was determined. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms (iNOS, eNOS, nNOS) and the key angiogenic molecules, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), were detected by Western blotting.
Scutellarin significantly reduced infarct volume (P<0.05 or P<0.01), ameliorated the neurological deficit and reduced the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (P<0.05). When rats were pretreated with scutellarin (50 or 75 mg/kg), upregulation of eNOS expression and downregulation of VEGF, bFGF, and iNOS expression was observed, whereas scutellarin had no effect on nNOS expression.
Scutellarin has protective effects for cerebral injury through regulating the expression of NOS isoforms and angiogenic molecules.
DHE is effective in the treatment of acute and chronic migraine. The side effects most commonly observed are abdominal discomfort, muscle pain, diarrhea and anxiety. DHE is a dehydrogenated amino acid ergot alkaloid and, as such, causes only limited vasoconstriction; indeed, its overall effects include peripheral vasodilation. The literature is replete with reports of clinical vasospasm and claudication occurring with therapeutic doses of ergotamine. There has not been any previous description of claudication caused by DHE. This paper describes pulselessness in two patients during relatively short courses of DHE. Treatment consisted of calcium channel blockers and discontinuation of DHE. Recovery was complete.
We report 3 cases of patients with HIV/AIDS in whom Fanconi syndrome and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus developed secondary to use of an antiretroviral regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine. These patients presented with a history of polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, anorexia, and wasting. Interestingly, 1 patient was not taking protease inhibitors. This response is a well-documented yet uncommon complication of tenofovir use in the HIV population. We recommend continued monitoring for renal toxicity when using NRTI combination of tenofovir and didanosine.
Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the most effective antioxidant enzyme in mitochondria and protects cells from reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between MnSOD Ala-9 Val gene polymorphism and prostate cancer (PCa) risk in Turkish men with prostate cancer. 33 patients with PCa and 81 control individuals were included in the study. We observed an association between MnSOD Ala/Ala frequency and a higher PCa risk. In addition, we found that the increased risk of early-onset PCa (under age of 65) in the men homozygous for Ala allele was higher than the men homozygous for Val allele. However, we determined that MnSOD Ala-9 Val genotype was not associated with the aggressiveness of the disease. The results of our study suggest that MnSOD Ala/Ala genotype may influence on early-onset of PCa patients, but no effect on subsequent development of the disease in Turkish men. However, our study has a limitation that is small numbers of individuals for cases and controls. Therefore, the presented study limited our statistical power to fully investigate the gene polymorphism on cancer risk.
A patient with a history of cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, and previous gastrectomy developed metabolic alkalosis and myoclonus. His medications included the anti-hypertensive agents nicardipine hydrochloride, delapril, prazosin; dihydroergotoxin and ticlopidine for cerebral infarction; estazolam for insomnia; azuren-L-glutamine compound and S-M powder. In addition, he had taken 12 grams per day of Ohta's Isan antacid, which contained 625 mg sodium bicarbonate per 1.3 g of antacid powder over a 6-month period. This antacid is commonly used in Japan. This is the first report of a case of metabolic alkalosis and myoclonus secondary to ingestion of a commercially available antacid in Japan.
Epidemiologic, clinical and pathologic data on all cases of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the genital tract in women born in 1940 and later are collected by the Registry for Research on Hormonal Transplacental Carcinogenesis. Other cases of genital cancer are also recorded if there is a history of prenatal hormone exposure. Evidence strongly suggest a mullerian nature for clear cell adenocarcinomas. Of the 333 cases accessioned between 1970 and 1976, about 2/3 of the completely investigated cases had histories of prenatal exposure to stilbestrol (DES) or similar compounds. Estimated risk of clear cell adenocarcinoma ranges from 0.14 to 1.4 per 1000 DES-exposed, with age-incidence peaking at age 19. Cytology and a thorough pelvic examination are important tools for accurate diagnosis. Surgery and radiation are used to treat these tumors, but follow up in most cases has been limited to 5 years. Several cases of small or superficial tumors have been observed to spread to regional pelvic nodes, with recurrences in the lungs or supraclavicular areas. For inquiries, contact the Registry for Research on Hormonal Transplacental Carcinogenesis, 5841 S. Maryland Ave., Chicago, Ill 60637. Analysis of pathologic specimens should be directed to Robert E. Scully, MD, Dept of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass 02114.
Dietary fish oil potentiates the susceptibility of cellular membranes to lipid peroxidation, although it is also known to have beneficial effects on the development of cardiovascular diseases.
The effects of dietary fish oil against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, in which free radicals and lipid peroxidation are involved, were investigated in rats.
Sprague-Dawley rats (100 g) were fed a standard diet or a high fish oil diet (containing 10% fish oil) throughout the experimental period. Four weeks after starting each diet, experimental rats were treated with doxorubicin (cumulative dose 15 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.28 M dextrose solution). After three weeks of doxorubicin treatment, the cardiac performance, myocardial lipid peroxidation and myocardial vitamin E level were assessed.
Compared with control rats, doxorubicin-treated rats showed a significantly increased mortality rate (P<0.05), and significantly decreased systolic blood pressure and left ventricular fractional shortening (P<0.01). The myocardial thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance level was significantly higher in doxorubicin-treated rats than in control rats (P<0.01), while the myocardial vitamin E level was significantly lower (P<0.05). Dietary fish oil enhanced the myocardial lipid peroxidation caused by doxorubicin, which was associated with a further decrease in myocardial vitamin E level. As a result, the rats treated with both doxorubicin and the high fish oil diet showed the highest mortality rate and the lowest cardiac performance of all the experimental groups.
Dietary fish oil may reduce antioxidant defences and accelerate susceptibility of the myocardium to lipid peroxidation in rats under doxorubicin treatment. This may partly explain why dietary fish oil does not prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Low-molecular weight heparin-induced cutaneous necrosis is exceptional. Pathogenesis remains unclear. We report an exceptional case with elective localization of the necrotic areas in insulin lipodystrophic tissue.
A 69-year old patient developed areas of skin necrosis after starting enoxaparin therapy. These areas were located far from the points of injection and focalized on skin areas where the patient had been injecting insulin daily for the last four years. These areas had an aspect of insulin lipodystrophy. Biopsy specimens showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. There were no associated biological anomalies. One month later, prick-tests were made with different low-molecular weight heparins and calcium heparinate in a lipodystrophic area together with an enoxaparin control test in healthy skin. The only positive test was for enoxaparin in an insulin lipodystrophic area (hard erythema at 24 hours). Histology at 72 hours demonstrated leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
Six cases of cutaneous necrosis induced by low-molecular weight heparin have been reported, including three cases with enoxaparin. Two pathophysiological mechanisms could be involved: (i) localized heparin-dependent platelet aggregation, or (ii) vasculitis induced by type III hypersensitivity reaction. In our case, the leukocytoclastic aspect of the vasculitis was compatible with an immune complex hypersensitivity reaction. The localization of the necrotic areas would be explained by enoxaparin-induced preferential deposit of immune complexes in the vascular turbulences present in lipodystrophic areas.
Whereas uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) is clearly involved in thermogenesis, the role of UCP-2 is less clear. Using hybridization, cloning techniques and cDNA array analysis to identify inducible neuroprotective genes, we found that neuronal survival correlates with increased expression of Ucp2. In mice overexpressing human UCP-2, brain damage was diminished after experimental stroke and traumatic brain injury, and neurological recovery was enhanced. In cultured cortical neurons, UCP-2 reduced cell death and inhibited caspase-3 activation induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation. Mild mitochondrial uncoupling by 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) reduced neuronal death, and UCP-2 activity was enhanced by palmitic acid in isolated mitochondria. Also in isolated mitochondria, UCP-2 shifted the release of reactive oxygen species from the mitochondrial matrix to the extramitochondrial space. We propose that UCP-2 is an inducible protein that is neuroprotective by activating cellular redox signaling or by inducing mild mitochondrial uncoupling that prevents the release of apoptogenic proteins.
The histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein-1 gene (HINT1) is implicated in schizophrenia and in the behavioral effects of morphine and amphetamine. Because nicotine dependence (ND) is highly comorbid with schizophrenia and other substance abuse, we examined the association of HINT1 with ND. Association analyses from two independent samples show that HINT1 gene variants are associated with ND phenotypes. Furthermore, human postmortem mRNA expression shows that smoking status and genotype influence HINT1 expression in the brain. In animal studies, western blot analyses show an increase of HINT1 protein level in the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) after chronic nicotine exposure. This increase was reduced after treatment with the nicotinic-receptor antagonist mecamylamine, and 24 and 72 h after cessation of nicotine treatment. These results indicate a genetic association between HINT1 variants and ND, and indicate that nicotine-induced modulation of HINT1 level may be involved in mechanisms of excess smoking.
