We report an olfactory disturbance after acne treatment with isotretinoin. A disturbance in taste was also reported by the patient. Examination of the nose showed no pathological findings. A CT scan was done to exclude a tumor or a lesion at the lamina cribrosa. Taste and smell examinations were performed and verified the lost qualities.
In several neoplastic diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma, the expression of P-glycoprotein and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are often increased and involved in drug resistance and poor prognosis. P-glycoprotein, in addition to drug resistance, blocks cytochrome c release, preventing apoptosis in tumor cells. Because COX-2 induces P-glycoprotein expression, we evaluated the effect of celecoxib, a specific inhibitor of COX-2 activity, on P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance to apoptosis in cell lines expressing multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype. Experiments were done using MDR-positive and parental cell lines at basal conditions and after exposure to 10 or 50 micromol/L celecoxib. We found that 10 micromol/L celecoxib reduced P-glycoprotein, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-2 expression, and induced translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria and cytochrome c release into cytosol in MDR-positive hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This causes the activation of caspase-3 and increases the number of cells going into apoptosis. No effect was shown on parental drug-sensitive or on MDR-positive hepatocellular carcinoma cells after transfection with MDR1 small interfering RNA. Interestingly, although inhibiting COX-2 activity, 50 micromol/L celecoxib weakly increased the expression of COX-2 and P-glycoprotein and did not alter Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-2 expression. In conclusion, these results show that relatively low concentrations of celecoxib induce cell apoptosis in MDR cell lines. This effect is mediated by P-glycoprotein and suggests that the efficacy of celecoxib in the treatment of different types of cancer may depend on celecoxib concentration and P-glycoprotein expression.
The progressive course of hepatic encephalopathy developing in rats after massive hepatic ischemia due to hepatic artery ligation within 48 hr of a portacaval shunt was not altered by the injection of a benzodiazepine antagonist, CGS 8216, in a dose that was sufficient to reverse diazepam-induced coma quickly. The onset of hepatic coma was shortened 20 to 25% by the antagonist, rather than being delayed, as would be expected if hepatic coma were due to a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic effect. The neural binding of GABA by brains from rats in deep hepatic coma was unaffected by the injection of the benzodiazepine antagonist.
Akathisia as a side-effect of metoclopramide has received increasing attention in consultation-liaison psychiatry in recent years. A case of metoclopramide-induced akathisia resulting in a suicide attempt is reported in order to highlight the suffering of such patients and the factors that lead to misdiagnosis.
We have previously reported a large Danish pedigree with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) linked to chromosome 3 (FTD3). Here we identify a mutation in CHMP2B, encoding a component of the endosomal ESCRTIII complex, and show that it results in aberrant mRNA splicing in tissue samples from affected members of this family. We also describe an additional missense mutation in an unrelated individual with FTD. Aberration in the endosomal ESCRTIII complex may result in FTD and neurodegenerative disease.
The present study was aimed at exploring the prevalence and factor structure of methamphetamine (MA) psychotic symptoms. The data were obtained from a cross-country evaluation of substance use, health, and treatment in MA psychotic in-patients. The prevalence rates of lifetime and current psychotic symptoms were determined by using Mini-International Neurospychiatric Interview-Plus, Module M. The Manchester scale was used to assess the severity of psychotic symptoms during the week prior to assessment. All eight items of the Manchester scale were subjected to principal-component analysis, eigenvalue one test, and varimax rotation. The data of 168 patients (127 male and 41 female) included in the analyses were obtained from Australia, Japan, the Philippines and Thailand. Persecutory delusion was the most common lifetime psychotic symptom found in 130 participants (77.4%), followed by auditory hallucinations, strange or unusual beliefs, and thought reading. Auditory hallucinations were the most common current symptom found in 75 participants (44.6%), followed by strange or unusual beliefs and visual hallucinations. Current negative symptoms were also found in 36 patients (21.4%). Apart from a factor of anxiety and depression, the results yielded a two-factor model of MA psychotic symptoms, which were negative and positive/disorganized syndromes. The negative syndrome comprised poverty of speech, psychomotor retardation, and flattened/incongruous affects. The positive syndrome consisted of delusions, hallucinations, and incoherent speech. Both positive/disorganized and negative syndromes should be taken into account in assessing MA psychotic symptoms. The clinical findings do not support the shortcomings of amphetamine-induced psychosis in modelling the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
Nimesulide is a relatively new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is gaining popularity in many countries because it is a selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor. Occasionally, treatment is associated with mild elevation of liver enzymes, which return to normal upon discontinuation of the drug. Several cases of nimesulide-induced symptomatic hepatitis were also recently reported, but these patients all recovered.
To report the characteristics of liver injury induced by nimesulide.
We report retrospectively six patients, five of them females with a median age of 59 years, whose aminotransferase levels rose after they took nimesulide for joint pains. In all patients nimesulide was discontinued, laboratory tests for viral and autoimmune causes of hepatitis were performed, and sufficient follow-up was available.
One patient remained asymptomatic. Four patients presented with symptoms, including fatigue, nausea and vomiting, which had developed several weeks after they began taking nimesulide (median 10 weeks, range 2-13). Hepatocellular injury was observed with median peak serum alanine aminotransferase 15 times the upper limit of normal (range 4-35), reversing to normal 2-4 months after discontinuation of the drug. The remaining patient developed symptoms, but continued taking the drug for another 2 weeks. She subsequently developed acute hepatic failure with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome and died 6 weeks after hospitalization. In none of the cases did serological tests for hepatitis A, B and C, Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, as well as autoimmune hepatitis reveal findings.
Nimesulide may cause liver damage. The clinical presentation may vary from abnormal liver enzyme levels with no symptoms, to fatal hepatic failure. Therefore, monitoring liver enzymes after initiating therapy with nimesulide seems prudent.
Renal side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are acute renal failure due to an impaired perfusion caused by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, acute allergic interstitial nephritis as well as acute toxic tubular necrosis. Moreover, chronic renal failure may occur due to a chronic interstitial nephritis or an analgesic nephropathy that is characterized by capillary sclerosis and papillary necrosis in addition to chronic interstitial nephritis. In contrast to acute renal insufficiency that may already occur after a single NSAID dose, analgesic nephropathy is a disease caused by long-term intake of NSAID compound analgesics and predominantly affects the middle and old age.
An 18-year-old patient with a 4-year history of NSAID compound analgesic intake presented to the urology department with right-sided flank pain and increased serum creatinine. An obstruction as well as nephrolithiasis were ruled out and the patient was referred to the medical department. Urinalysis showed leukocyturia, mild microhematuria as well as proteinuria of 2.2 g/day whereupon a diagnostic kidney biopsy was performed. Histology revealed a chronic nonpurulent destructive interstitial nephritis. After cessation of analgesic intake, the serum creatinine level fell to the normal range; however, a reduced creatinine clearance persisted indicating chronic renal damage.
The present case is remarkable in that chronic renal damage due to intake of a compound analgesic was already observed in an 18-year-old patient. In this context, the permission of NSAID compound analgesics and their free over-the-counter sale to adolescents need to be critically questioned.
Thrombotic microangiopathy is a well-known problem in patients following renal transplantation. In postrenal transplantation, thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome. We aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature.
We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval. Pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible.
Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found. Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up. Three cases were related to cyclosporine, and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.
In the literature, the most-frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Other causes include drug-related (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) toxicity, procoagulant status, and antibody-mediated rejection. We found that the most-frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related, secondary mainly to cyclosporine. In the current study, the frequency of thrombotic microangiopathy was similar to the percentage reported in the literature (20%).
Thalidomide has been shown to be effective in approximately 30% of patients with refractory or advanced multiple myeloma (MM). Here we report on 4 cases of patients treated with thalidomide for refractory MM showing dedifferentiation of the neoplasm. In these cases thalidomide treatment despite reduction of M-component-was followed by disease progression and a very poor clinical outcome which was paralleled by bone marrow plasmacytosis showing marked signs of dedifferentiation, inducing us to speculate on a potential role of thalidomide on dedifferentiation of myeloma cells. In our opinion, a possible dedifferentiation of MM should therefore be taken into account in MM patients treated with thalidomide when clinical course deteriorates despite reduction of M-component.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening neurologic emergency that may be caused by neuroleptic agents of any class. The association with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is rare and carries a grave prognosis. We describe the case of a 25-year-old male patient with haloperidol-induced NMS complicated by HHS that culminated in the patient's death despite all treatment efforts. Physicians caring for diabetic psychiatric patients who are treated with neuroleptic agents should be aware of this association that may be prevented by tight glycemic control.
In the Medical Research Council trial for the treatment of mild hypertension, bendrofluazide showed an unexpected and sizeable benefit compared with propranolol in the reduction of stroke. It is suggested that this difference reflects the opposing actions of these drugs on the renin-angiotensin system. The hypothesis that angiotensin-II protects the distal smaller cerebral vessels, which are the usual site of vessel rupture in intracerebral haemorrhage, indicates that long-term benefit of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension cannot be assumed.
To describe the effectiveness and safety of succinylcholine administration by paramedics to out-of-hospital patients requiring endotracheal intubation.
A consecutive case series was collected by retrospective review of patient care records from a large, private ambulance agency serving an urban and rural county of 600,000 residents over a 40-month period. All patients for whom endotracheal intubation was facilitated by succinylcholine use were identified. Data were systematically collected on demographics, paramedic diagnosis, intubation attempts, and complications.
Succinylcholine was used in 150 patients with a mean age (+/-SD) of 50+/-23 years. Paramedic diagnosis was coma in 43% (64/150; 95% confidence interval [CI] 35% to 51%), trauma in 26% (39/150; 95% CI 19% to 33%), and respiratory failure in 31% (47/150; 95% CI 23% to 39%). No patient was in cardiac arrest at the time of succinylcholine use. The intubation success rate was 92% (138/150; 95% CI 88% to 96%), with success achieved on the first attempt in 82% of patients (123/150; 95% CI 76% to 88%). Four patients who received succinylcholine developed cardiac arrest, and 3 others had symptomatic bradycardia.
The use of succinylcholine by paramedics to assist intubation appears to aid in intubation of patients who are not in cardiac arrest. However, significant cardiac complications can occur.
To investigate the possible link between neuropeptide Y (NPY) and depression, we analyzed NPY and its receptors in different limbic-related regions in the Flinder sensitive line (FSL), a genetic animal model of depression. In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to measure mRNA expression levels of NPY and NPY receptors, Y1 and Y2, in the FSL as compared to the control Flinder resistant Line rats (FRL). In the FSL rats, NPY mRNA expression levels were significantly decreased in the nucleus accumbens and CA regions, but increased in the arcuate nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex. Y1 receptor mRNA expression was decreased in different cortical regions (retrosplenial, anterior cingulate, and occipital) and in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Y2 mRNA expression levels did not differ between FSL and FRL animals. The effect of the antidepressant drug fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) in the two rat strains was also studied. There was an increase of the NPY mRNA hybridization signal in the arcuate nucleus of both strains following the antidepressant treatment (10 micromol/kg; daily for 14 days). However, in other brain regions, fluoxetine administration caused a differential effect on the induction of NPY-related genes in the two rat strains: in the CA region and dentate gyrus NPY mRNA expression was increased in the FSL, but decreased in the FRL. In contrast, Y1 mRNA levels tended to be decreased by fluoxetine in the nucleus accumbens of the FSL rats, but increased in the FRL. These findings suggest an involvement of the Y1, but not the Y2, receptor subtype in depressive disorder. Overall, the results appear to sustain the importance of the FSL rats as an animal model of depression in view of the impairment of NPY genes and the ability of fluoxetine treatment to normalize NPY-related gene expression selectively in this strain.
Cocaine is a substance that has significant central stimulant action in the central nervous system. As cocaine abuse spreads throughout society, many neurologic side effects are appearing with increasing frequency. These side effects include seizures, tremor, focal neurologic deficits, headache, and dizziness. Recently, there have been reports of movement disorders associated with cocaine use. Cocaine use increases the incidence of acute dystonic reactions in patients being treated with dopamine blocking agents. There have also been rare reports of cocaine causing dystonia in patients who were taking no other street drugs or medications. Our report describes the case of a patient who had an acute dystonic reaction 12 hours after a crack cocaine binge.
A 5-year-old Chinese girl had had absence seizures and received sodium valproate (VPA) treatment which provided good control. Six months later, she developed interstitial nephritis with proteinuria and microhematuria. Renal biopsy revealed interstitial nephritis with granular deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C3 in the renal tubular basement membrane (TBM). Ultrastructurally, dilated smooth endoreticular cisternae with mitochondrial degeneration in the tubular cells and scattered electron-dense deposits within the TBM were also noted. Serum circulating immune complexes were detectable, ACH50 and properdin factor B increased. Mononuclear cells (MNC) from the patient after in vitro incubation with VPA (100 micrograms/ml) induced interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and lymphoproliferative response. However, there was no response in controls. The serum VPA level ranged from 84 to 92 micrograms/ml. After VPA was stopped, the microhematuria and proteinuria disappeared. These observations indicate that VPA-induced interstitial nephritis represents a sequence of interrelationships among multiple immunologic factors.
A case of primary hemangioendothelioma is presented. Following autodearterialization, the patient received 5-fluorouracil orally and total hepatic radiation. To date, 30 months later, he remains alive and active with residual hepatic defect on liver scan, but no indication of progression of disease. Primary malignant hemangioendothelioma is discussed briefly in terms of etiology, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment, and a treatment plan is presented. This case also presented an unusual side effect of 5-fluorouracil therapy -- mononeuritis multiplex -- and is presented out of interest.
Contact allergy to methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDBGN), often combined with phenoxyethanol (PE) (e.g., Euxyl K 400), increased throughout the 1990s in Europe. Consequently, in 2003, the European Commission banned its use in leave-on products, where its use concentration was considered too high and the non-sensitizing use concentration as yet unknown. The 2 objectives of the study are (a) to find a maximum non-eliciting concentration in a leave-on product in MDBGN/PE-sensitized patients, which could possibly also be considered safe regarding induction and (b) to find the best patch test concentration for MDBGN. We, therefore, performed a use-related test (ROAT) in patients sensitized to MDBGN/PE (n = 39) with 3 concentrations of MDBGN/PE (50, 100 and 250 p.p.m. MDBGN, respectively). A subset of these patients (n = 24) was later patch-tested with various concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5% MDBGN, respectively). 15 patients (38%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 23-55%) had a negative and 24 (62%; 95% CI = 45-77%) a positive overall repeated open application test (ROAT) result. 13 reacted to the lowest (50 p.p.m.), 8 to the middle (100 p.p.m.) and 3 to the highest concentration (250 p.p.m.) only. In those 13 reacting to the lowest ROAT concentration, dermatitis developed within a few days (1-7). The strength of the initial and the confirmatory patch test result, respectively, and the outcome of the ROAT were positively associated. Of the 24 patients with a use and confirmatory patch test, 15 reacted to 0.1% MDBGN, 16 to 0.2%, 17 to 0.3% and 22 to 0.5%. With the patch test concentration of 0.5%, the number of ROAT-negative patients but patch-test-positive patients increases considerably, particularly due to + reactions. A maximum sensitivity of 94% (95% CI = 70-100%) is reached with a patch test concentration of 0.2%, and is not further improved by increasing the concentration. However, the specificity decreases dramatically from 88 (95% CI = 47-100%) with 0.2% to a mere 12.5% (95% CI = 0-53%) with 0.5%. It can be concluded (a) that for MDBGN 0.2% is very likely the best patch test concentration and (b) that 50 p.p.m. in a leave-on product can elicit contact dermatitis in sensitized persons. We were, therefore, unable to find a safe, still microbicidal, concentration for leave-on products. By contrast, with other contact allergens, dose-response use tests may be able to identify a non-eliciting concentration, which could give valuable clues to a non-inducing (i.e., safe) concentration in products.
The only proven requirement for ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is in preventing scurvy, presumably because it is a cofactor for hydroxylases required for post-translational modifications that stabilize collagen. We have created mice deficient in the mouse ortholog (solute carrier family 23 member 1 or Slc23a1) of a rat ascorbic-acid transporter, Svct2 (ref. 4). Cultured embryonic fibroblasts from homozygous Slc23a1(-/-) mice had less than 5% of normal ascorbic-acid uptake. Ascorbic-acid levels were undetectable or markedly reduced in the blood and tissues of Slc23a1(-/-) mice. Prenatal supplementation of pregnant females did not elevate blood ascorbic acid in Slc23a1(-/-) fetuses, suggesting Slc23a1 is important in placental ascorbic-acid transport. Slc23a1(-/-) mice died within a few minutes of birth with respiratory failure and intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage. Lungs showed no postnatal expansion but had normal surfactant protein B levels. Brain hemorrhage was unlikely to be simply a form of scurvy since Slc23a1(-/-) mice showed no hemorrhage in any other tissues and their skin had normal skin 4-hydroxyproline levels despite low ascorbic-acid content. We conclude that Slc23a1 is required for transport of ascorbic acid into many tissues and across the placenta. Deficiency of the transporter is lethal in newborn mice, thereby revealing a previously unrecognized requirement for ascorbic acid in the perinatal period.
Serum DHEAS has been found to be elevated in some women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We wished to determine whether this prevalence is different in women with androgen excess who have different phenotypes and to correlate these findings with various cardiovascular and metabolic parameters.
Two hundred and thirty-eight young hyperandrogenic women categorized into various diagnostic groups were evaluated for elevations in serum DHEAS, testosterone, glucose, insulin, quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI), cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides and C-reactive protein (CRP). Data were stratified based on elevations in DHEAS.
Serum DHEAS was elevated in 39.5% for the entire group [36.7% in PCOS and 48.3% in idiopathic hyperandrogenism (IHA)]. In classic (C)-PCOS, the prevalence was 39.6% and in ovulatory (OV) PCOS it was 29.1%. These differences were not statistically significant. Women with elevated DHEAS had higher testosterone but lower insulin, higher QUICKI, lower total and LDL-cholesterol and higher HDL-cholesterol, p<0.01. Triglycerides and CRP were not different. This trend was greatest in women with C-PCOS.
The prevalence of adrenal hyperandrogenism, as determined by elevations in DHEAS, appears to be statistically similar in IHA, C-PCOS and compared to OV-PCOS. Metabolic and cardiovascular parameters were noted to be more favorable in those women who have higher DHEAS levels.
Preventing and/or treating renal and other complications of long-term lithium therapy remains a challenge to clinicians. A review of studies in animals and anecdotal reports in humans suggests that potassium may have therapeutic value in this regard.
The Lithium Information Center data base of over 20,000 articles was searched under the title and subject heading of "potassium." Pertinent articles from the 303 references obtained served as the basis for this review.
Studies in rats found that dietary potassium supplementation reduced adverse effects of lithium on growth and renal function and morphology. Loss of intracellular potassium may contribute to lithium-induced electrocardiographic ST-T wave changes. Little work has been done in humans to evaluate the potential benefit of potassium supplementation.
Hypokalemia should be avoided or corrected in patients taking lithium. The role of potassium supplementation in preventing renal and other complications in the presence of normokalemia requires further investigation.
Evidence has indicated that plasma ghrelin was elevated in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with cachexia. The present report studied whether pathophysiologic increment of endogenous ghrelin levels was existed in the progression of adriamycin (ADR)-induced CHF, then the possible compensatory mechanism by which the changes were induced and the relationship between active ghrelin, cardiac function and energy reserve in heart failure (HF) rats were explored. Cardiac function, high energy phosphates (HEP) content, and ghrelin levels in plasma and myocardium were measured at 4 days, 1, 2 and 3 weeks after the last injection of ADR, after which correlation analysis was performed between these markers in HF rats. Results showed that cardiac function decreased early, then was significantly restored and worsened at 3 weeks accompanied by the decrease of myocardial ATP content. Plasma ghrelin level increased significantly at each time point while myocardial ghrelin level increased transiently, then was restored followed by increased oxidative stress status and apoptosis in the weakening heart. Moreover, correlation analysis indicated that the markers of cardiac function and HEP were positively correlated to the endogenous ghrelin levels at the HF stage. This study indicated that the increase of endogenous ghrelin levels during the progression of the HF induced by ADR represent a compensatory self-protective effect by improving cardiac function and retaining myocardial energy reserve; this may be closely linked to anti-oxidative and anti-apoptosis mechanisms through regulating myocardial mitochondria function by ghrelin; but further investigations are necessary.
A National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network randomized trial showed that vitamin A supplementation reduced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (O2 at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age) or death in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates (relative risk [RR]: 0.89). As with postnatal steroids or other interventions, it is important to ensure that there are no longer-term adverse effects that outweigh neonatal benefits.
To determine if vitamin A supplementation in ELBW infants during the first month after birth affects survival without neurodevelopmental impairment at a corrected age of 18 to 22 months.
Infants enrolled in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development vitamin A trial were evaluated at 18 to 22 months by carefully standardized assessments: Bayley Mental Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Index (PDI), visual and hearing screens, and physical examination for cerebral palsy (CP). The medical history was also obtained. Neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) was predefined as > or =1 of MDI <70, PDI <70, CP, blind in both eyes, or hearing aids in both ears.
Of 807 enrolled infants, 133 died before and 16 died after discharge. Five hundred seventy-nine (88%) of the 658 remaining infants were followed up. The primary outcome of NDI or death could be determined for 687 of 807 randomized infants (85%). Baseline characteristics and predischarge and postdischarge mortality were comparable in both study groups. NDI or death by 18 to 22 months occurred in 190 of 345 (55%) infants in the vitamin A group and in 204 of 342 (60%) of the control group (RR: 0.94; 95% confidence interval: 0.80-1.07). RRs for low MDI, low PDI, and CP were also <1.0. We found no evidence that neonatal vitamin A supplementation reduces hospitalizations or pulmonary problems after discharge.
Vitamin A supplementation for ELBW infants reduces bronchopulmonary dysplasia without increasing mortality or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months. However, this study was not powered to evaluate small magnitudes of change in long-term outcomes.
