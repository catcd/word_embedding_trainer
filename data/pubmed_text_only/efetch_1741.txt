In a 3-year study, adult patients who recently developed asthma (symptoms for less than 1 year) were treated for 2 years with the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) budesonide (early therapy) or terbutaline. During the third year of the study, terbutaline-treated patients received budesonide (delayed therapy). Differences in lung function and bronchial responsiveness to histamine were observed between the 2 groups.
We compared the effects of early versus delayed budesonide therapy after a 10-year follow-up period (13 years after the study began) and current real-life data.
Of the original 103 patients, 90 were re-examined 13 years after study initiation. After the third year of the study, all patients had their medications, including the dose of ICS, individually adjusted.
After the follow-up period, lung function was within the normal range for the entire group (all patients); bronchial responsiveness significantly improved compared with baseline data. No statistically significant differences in clinical or functional variables were found between patients given early or delayed budesonide therapy. However, the delayed therapy group had a higher neutrophil count and higher concentrations of eosinophilic cationic protein and myeloperoxidase in induced sputum. This group had also used more asthma medication and hospital days.
Patients with relatively mild asthma who received ICS within 12 months of their first asthma symptoms or after a 2-year delay achieved equally good functional control of asthma after 10 years of individualized therapy. However, the delayed therapy group exhibited slightly less optimal disease control and more signs of airway inflammation.
Benthic cyanobacteria from aquatic environments have been reported to produce biologically active metabolites. However, the toxicity and other biological activities of benthic cyanobacteria from the Baltic Sea are not well known. We determined the biological activities of 21 Anabaena, Calothrix, Nodularia, Nostoc, and Phormidium strains isolated from benthic littoral habitats of the Baltic Sea. We studied whether benthic cyanobacterial extracts caused cytotoxicity by necrosis or induced apoptosis in two mammalian cell lines, a human leukemia cell line (HL-60) and a mouse fibroblast cell line (3T3 Swiss), and examined potential hepatotoxin (microcystin and nodularin) production. Five of the six benthic Anabaena strains, one of the two Nostoc strains, and two of the three Nodularia strains were highly cytotoxic to human leukemia cells. The Calothrix and Phormidium strains did not cause LDH leakage, but the extract of Phormidium strain BECID15 induced apoptosis in the HL-60 cells. Neither the microcystin synthetase E (mcyE) nor the nodularin synthetase F (ndaF) gene was amplified by PCR, and no microcystins or nodularins were detected by the protein phosphatase inhibition assay from the cyanobacterial strains included in this study. This indicates that benthic Baltic cyanobacteria contain potentially harmful cytotoxic compounds even though they do not produce microcystins or nodularins. These cytotoxic compounds remain to be characterized, and the mechanisms of cytotoxicity need to be studied further.
In therapeutic use, amitriptyline, reboxetine and citalopram have all been associated with apparent anticholinergic-like side effects (dry mouth, constipation, etc.), despite the very low antimuscarinic activity of reboxetine and citalopram in vitro.
We hypothesised that the spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) might detect differences between amitriptyline, citalopram and reboxetine in their anticholinergic activities following a single peroral administration.
In this double-blind, cross-over study, amitriptyline (75 mg), citalopram (20 mg), reboxetine (4 mg) and placebo were randomly given at 1-week intervals to eight healthy male volunteers. Drug and catecholamine concentrations in plasma were determined repeatedly. The drug effect was assessed with periodic recordings of electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure, and with measurements of salivary secretion. The ECG recordings were subjected to spectral analysis of HRV, in which the high frequency (HF) power of R-R interval (RRI) variability was supposed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic tone.
Reboxetine increased heart rate and blood pressure and reduced the HF power of RRI and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) plasma concentrations. Amitriptyline diminished salivary secretion and had a prominent sedative action. Measurements after citalopram did not differ significantly from placebo.
Reboxetine, despite its low antimuscarinic activity in vitro, had distinct effects on the HF power of RRI, consistent with anticholinergic activity in vivo. Amitriptyline had a measurable anticholinergic effect in the salivary glands, but, surprisingly, not in the heart. We suggest that the sedative effect of amitriptyline could alter cardiac sympathovagal balance and, therefore, counteract the anticholinergic drug effect.
Hindlimb suspension (HLS) elicits muscle atrophy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in skeletal muscle. Increases in oxidative stress can have detrimental effects on muscle mass and function, and it can potentially lead to myonuclear apoptosis. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol possessing both antioxidant and antiaging properties. To analyze the capacity of resveratrol to attenuate oxidative stress, apoptosis and muscle force loss were measured following 14 days of HLS. Young (6 mo) and old (34 mo) rats were administered either 12.5 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) of trans-resveratrol, or 0.1% carboxymethylcellulose for 21 days, including 14 days of HLS. HLS induced a significant decrease in plantarflexor isometric force, but resveratrol blunted this loss in old animals. Resveratrol increased gastrocnemius catalase activity, MnSOD activity, and MnSOD protein content following HLS. Resveratrol reduced hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation levels in muscles from old animals after HLS. Caspase 9 abundance was reduced and Bcl-2 was increased, but other apoptotic markers were not affected by resveratrol in the gastrocnemius muscle after HLS. The data indicate that resveratrol has a protective effect against oxidative stress and muscle force loss in old HLS animals; however, resveratrol was unable to attenuate apoptosis following HLS. These results suggest that resveratrol has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent to treat muscle functional decrements via improving the redox status associated with disuse.
Alterations in sphingolipid metabolism have been shown to contribute to the development of endocrine resistance and breast cancer tumor survival. Sphingosine kinase (SK), in particular, is overexpressed in breast cancer and is a promising target for breast cancer drug development. In this study, we used the novel SK inhibitor ABC294640 as a tool to explore the relationship between SK and estrogen (E2) receptor (ER) signaling in breast cancer cells. Treatment with ABC294640 decreased E2-stimulated ERE-luciferase activity in both MCF-7 and ER-transfected HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitor reduced E2-mediated transcription of the ER-regulated genes progesterone receptor and SDF-1. Competitive receptor-binding assays revealed that ABC294640 binds in the antagonist ligand-binding domain of the ER, acting as a partial antagonist similar to tamoxifen. Finally, treatment with ABC294640 inhibited ER-positive breast cancer tumor formation in vivo. After 15 d of treatment with ABC294640, tumor volume was reduced by 68.4% (P < 0.05; n = 5) compared with control tumors, with no marked weight loss or illness. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that this novel SK inhibitor, which had not previously been known to interact with E2 signaling pathways, has therapeutic potential in treating ER-positive breast cancer via inhibition of both SK and ER signaling.
To assess the statistical relationship between tumor growth and copper metabolism, we performed a metaanalysis of studies in which patients with neoplasms were characterized according to any of the copper status indexes (atomic copper serum concentration, serum oxidase activity, ceruloplasmin protein content). Our metaanalysis shows that in the majority of cases (more than 3100 patients), tumor growth positively correlates with the copper status indexes. Nude athymic CD-1 nu/nu mice with subcutaneous tumors of human origin, C57Bl/6J mice with murine melanoma and Apc(Min) mice with spontaneously developing adenomas throughout the intestinal tract were studied to experimentally determine the relationship between tumor progression, liver copper metabolism, and copper status indexes. We showed that the copper status indexes increased significantly during tumor growth. In the liver tissue of tumor-bearing mice, ceruloplasmin gene expression, as well as the expression of genes related to ceruloplasmin metallation (CTR1 and ATP7B), increased significantly. Moreover, the presence of an mRNA splice variant encoding a form of ceruloplasmin anchored to the plasma membrane by glycosylphosphatidyl inositol, which is atypical for hepatocytes, was also detected. The ATP7A copper transporter gene, which is normally expressed in the liver only during embryonic copper metabolism, was also activated. Depletion of holo-ceruloplasmin resulted in retardation of human HCT116 colon carcinoma cell growth in nude mice and induced DNA fragmentation in tumor cells. In addition, the concentration of cytochrome c increased significantly in the cytosol, while decreasing in the mitochondria. We discuss a possible trans-effect of developing tumors on copper metabolism in the liver.
Downbeat nystagmus is often associated with structural lesions at the craniocervical junction, but has occasionally been reported as a manifestation of metabolic imbalance or drug intoxication. We recorded the eye movements of two patients with reversible downbeat nystagmus related to carbamazepine therapy. The nystagmus of both patients resolved after reduction of the serum carbamazepine levels. Neuroradiologic investigations including magnetic resonance imaging scans in both patients showed no evidence of intracranial abnormality. In patients with downbeat nystagmus who are taking anticonvulsant medications, consideration should be given to reduction in dose before further investigation is undertaken.
Two cases of penile angioedema associated with the use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angio-tensin II receptor blockers are reported.
The first case of penile angioe-dema involved a 68-year-old man who arrived at the emergency department (ED) with a 2-12-hour history of penile swelling occurring three days after initiation of irbesartan in addition to longstanding lisinopril therapy. All parts of the physical examination were normal, except for the genital examination. The patient's penis was edematous at midshaft only and was nontender with normal skin coloring. The edema was nonpitting and limited to the skin. The patient was instructed to stop taking both lisinopril and irbesartan, and symptoms resolved within 48 hours with supportive care alone. In the second case, a 48-year-old man arrived at the ED complaining of penile swelling over the previous two days. Enalapril had been initiated one month before his arrival at the ED. The patient's penis was nontender and edematous at midshaft. The edema was nonpitting and limited to the skin. The patient was instructed to stop taking enalapril, given oral prednisone 60 mg, and asked to continue his prednisone for five days after discharge. The swelling resolved within two days of stopping enalapril, and he had no further episodes of penile swelling. Neither patient was rechallenged with the offending medications.
Penile angioedema was reported in two patients. The first case involved a patient receiving both lisinopril and irbesartan. The second patient was receiving enalapril only.
A report is given on the clinical trial of the ultra-short-acting hypnotic etomidate for treatment of withdrawal delirium with special reference to delirium tremens. Severe and disturbing side-effects such as myoclonic movements or seizures with equivalent EEG changes compelled discontinuance of the therapy in five of seven patients. The activation of epileptogenic activity in the treatment of delirium tremens by etomidate long-term-infusions and the lack of international experience in this field do not support the use of etomidate as an anticonvulsive agent.
The aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) induces nephrotic syndrome in rats. We studied the tubulointerstitial cellular (TIC) infiltrate previously unrecognized in this model. Rats received one i.p. injection of PAN (15 mg/100 g) and were sacrificed at 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 20 and 28 days. Frozen kidney sections and peripheral blood cells were stained with a panel of anti-rat monoclonal antibodies and quantitated by epifluorescence microscopy. An increase in Ia+ cells (60/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001) and OX42+ macrophages (MO) (18/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.05) were observed on day 5. On day 7 the infiltrate consisted of OX19+ T-lymphocytes (29/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001) and OX42+ MO (68/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001). The majority of the lymphocytes expressed the OX8 cytotoxic T cell marker (23/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001). The severe mixed cellular lesion present on day 14 was dominated by OX42+ MO (113/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001). With resolution of proteinuria on days 20 and 28, the infiltrate decreased, although OX42+ MO persisted on day 28 (46/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.001). The severity of the cellular lesion correlated with the degree of albuminuria (r = 0.57 to 0.81 for the antibody panel). Expression of Ia antigens by proximal tubular epithelial cells markedly decreased during peak proteinuria but normalized by day 28. Increased deposition of C3 and IgG was not detected. Reversible tubulointerstitial nephritis develops in PAN-treated rats and may be a consequence of severe proteinuria.
Distal chromosome 3p deletions (3p- syndrome) are associated with various developmental defects. The majority of cases have a terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 with loss of either the maternal or the paternal copy. A girl with an interstitial molecularly characterized 1.6 Mb deletion in cytoband 3p25.3-26.1 of the paternal chromosome 3 is presented. To our knowledge, she possesses the smallest deletion that has ever been reported for a patient with a clinical phenotype in accordance with the 3p- syndrome. The boundaries of the deletion lies within nearly all previously reported terminal deletions causing this syndrome. Selected genes that are present in the hemizygous state and which might be important for the phenotype of this patient as regards the congenital heart defect, autistic behavior and mental retardation (CAV3, OXTR, and SRGAP3/MEGAP, respectively) are discussed in context of the clinical features.
Six patients developed dementia-like cognitive changes that appeared to result from administration of steroid medications. Four of the patients never showed symptoms of steroid psychosis; the remaining two continued to show steroid dementia well after their steroid psychoses had resolved. The dementia was characterized by deficits in memory retention, attention, concentration, mental speed and efficiency, and occupational performance. All six patients eventually recovered normal mental status following discontinuation or reduction of steroid medications. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine the prevalence and nature of the syndrome.
We describe a chromosome rearrangement, ins(7;13)(q32q34;q32), which segregates in a three generation family, giving rise to three individuals with an unbalanced rearrangement. Two of the individuals, a sister and a brother, were investigated further in this study. They had minor facial dysmorphism and neuropsychiatric disorders including mental retardation, language delay and epilepsy. The sister had primary amenorrhea. Array CGH revealed a 12.2 Mb deletion at 7q34-q36.2 including more than 60 genes where CNTNAP2 and NOBOX are of special interest. Comparison of the clinical and cytogenetic findings of our patients with previously reported patients, supports that haploinsuffiency of CNTNAP2 can result in language delay and/or autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, we report on the second women with a deletion involving NOBOX who is affected by primary amenorrhea.
Much has been written about adverse effects accompanying the use of phenytoin. However, the rare occurrence of systemic vasculitis induced by this drug has only been the subject of sporadic case reports and has not truly been characterized as a definitive entity. The high fatality rate of this complication is a proof of its severity. A case of multiorgan necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis related to the use of phenytoin is reported and the clinicopathologic aspects of seven similar cases assembled from the literature are summarized and discussed. The most commonly affected patients are elderly black men who present with skin rash, fever, and, frequently, eosinophilia. Tissue examination discloses systemic vasculitis that is often granulomatous and involves mainly the liver, kidneys, and spleen. Immediate recognition of this diagnosis is stressed, since proper treatment may reverse a fatal clinical course.
Rats received 0.15 M LiCl either as a central treatment in the lateral cerebroventricles (2x20 microliter/rat) or as a peripheral treatment in the peritoneal cavity 15 ml/kg). The central treatment produced high lithium concentrations (1-1.2 mmol/kg) in the brain while peripheral treatment produced high lithium levels (1-2 mmol/1) in the blood at convenient times for behavioral tests. The central treatment antagonized amphetamine-induced hyperactivity but failed to affect open field behavior in otherwise untreated rats. In contrast, the peripheral treatment suppressed open field activity in otherwise untreated rats but failed to influence behavioral effects of amphetamine. The findings demonstrate differences between central and peripheral actions of LiCl on behavior in rats and show lithium to have central actions on hyperactivity induced by amphetamine.
The mechanism of hypertension induced by adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) remains unclear. The antihypertensive renomedullary lipids are vasodilators and it has been proposed that a deficiency of these lipids may contribute to the hypertension produced by destruction of the renal papilla. The aim of the present work was to study ACTH hypertension in both control and chemically renomedullectomized rats.
Renomedullectomy was produced by single intraperitoneal injection of 2-bromoethylamine (BEA) at 400 mg/kg.
BEA-treated rats all developed increases in water intake and urine volume, with loss of papillae and medullary and cortical fibrosis. There was a significant correlation between papillary ablation and systolic blood pressure (SBP). SBP in renomedullectomized rats was higher after ACTH than sham injection, and higher than after ACTH injection in intact rats.
Chemical renomedullectomy with BEA did not block or attenuate the onset or magnitude of ACTH hypertension in the rat.
The herb of Oldenlandia diffusa (Willd.) Roxb. (Family Rubiaceae) is well-known in Chinese folk medicine for the treatment of hepatitis and malignant tumors of the liver, lung and stomach. However, another herb of O. corymbosa (L.) Lam is also used interchangeably in South China for treating the same conditions. To compare the efficacy of the two herbs, the antiproliferative effect of their extracts and the antiangiogenic activity of their main constituents were appraised. The Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and human colon carcinoma CaCo2 cells and the zebrafish angiogenic model were used for this purpose. The results showed almost no antiproliferative effect of the methanol extracts from O. diffusa and O. corymbosa, while the chloroform extracts exhibited slightly antiproliferative effects. The main components had almost no effect on zebrafish angiogenic vessel formation at the concentrations tested. The results suggest that the mechanism of antitumor activity of O. diffusa may not be attributed to the antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects.
Therapeutic options are limited and the prognosis is poor for patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Bortezomib induces apoptosis in vitro in CLL cells, both alone and in combination, including in cells resistant to fludarabine or other agents. The aim of the current randomized, open-label, Phase II study was to investigate the clinical activity of bortezomib in patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell CLL. Twenty-two patients with histologically confirmed B-cell CLL were treated with bortezomib at doses of 1.0 mg/m2, 1.3 mg/m2, or 1.5 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle for a maximum of 9 cycles. None of 19 patients evaluable for response achieved complete remission or partial response; however, signs of biologic activity based on disease site responses (e.g., reduction in lymphocytosis, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy) were observed. In the 1.5 mg/m2 dose group, a higher proportion of patients had stable disease, and a lower proportion had progressive disease compared with the 2 lower-dose groups. Eleven patients, all in the 2 higher dose groups, experienced Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]); 2 patients experienced Grade 4 neutropenia. Grade 3 hematologic AEs included anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia; Grade 3 nervous system AEs included aphasia; peripheral neuropathy, not otherwise specified; and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Although no objective responses were achieved in patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell CLL, single-agent bortezomib demonstrated biologic activity. In view of the evidence for its activity, further exploration of bortezomib in combination with other agents is warranted.
Substantial evidence implicates mast cells and their main constituent histamine in the pathogenesis of visceral hypersensitivity. We explored the specific contribution of histamine H4 (H4R) and H1 (H1R) receptors to visceral hypersensitivity in a postinflammatory rat model.
Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-colitis was monitored individually by colonoscopy: first on day 3 to confirm the presence of colitis and then every 4 days, starting from day 10, to monitor convalescence and determine the exact timepoint of endoscopic healing in each rat. Experiments were performed 3 days after endoscopic resolution of colitis. Visceral sensitivity was assessed by quantifying visceromotor responses (VMRs) to colorectal distension. Colonic mast cell numbers, histamine release and H4R and H1R mRNA expression were quantified. JNJ7777120 (H4R antagonist) and/or levocetirizine (H1R antagonist) were administered 30 min prior to VMR assessment or histamine release assay.
Postcolitis rats displayed a higher number of colonic mast cells, excessive histamine release and significantly enhanced VMRs. Heightened VMRs were dose-dependently reduced by JNJ7777120 and levocetirizine; combined administration of JNJ7777120 and levocetirizine potentiated the antinociceptive effect. In the colon, both H4R and H1R mRNA were present; in the dorsal root ganglia, only H1R mRNA was found. Only colonic H4R mRNA expression was increased in postcolitis rats. Excessive histamine release in postcolitis rats was attenuated by the highest dose of JNJ7777120.
H4R and H1R antagonists dose-dependently reduce and even normalise postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity via different underlying mechanisms but with a synergistic effect. Both receptor subtypes represent promising targets for the treatment of postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity.
Four derivatives of the ergot dopamine (DA) agonist lisuride (LIS), namely 6-n-propyl-lisuride (6-n-propyl-LIS), transdihydrolisuride (TDHL), 6-n-propyl-transdi-hydrolisuride (6-n-propyl-TDHL) and 2-bromolisuride (2-Br-LIS) were investigated in female rats with regard to their influence on hyperprolactinaemia induced by pretreatment with reserpine (2 mg/kg i.p., 24 h) at various intervals following their subcutaneous or oral administration (0.05 mg/kg). Two hours after administration, LIS, 6-n-propyl-LIS, and 6-n-propyl-TDHL caused a statistically significant inhibition of reserpine-induced hyperprolactinaemia of about the same extent. Eight hours after administration 6-n-propyl-LIS and 6-n-propyl-TDHL were as active as after 2 h in inhibiting prolactin (PRL) secretion whereas LIS was almost ineffective in this respect. TDHL caused a statistically significant inhibition of PRL secretion at 2 and 8 h after oral administration; this effect was less pronounced after s.c. administration. In contrast to the aforementioned derivatives 2-Br-LIS further increased the reserpine-induced hyperprolactinaemia. In normal male rats pretreatment with 2-Br-LIS (0.025-6.25 mg/kg s.c., 2 h) dose-dependently stimulated PRL secretion. The present data support the assumption of the longlasting DA agonistic action of 6-n-propyl-LIS and 6-n-propyl-TDHL and of the antidopaminergic properties of 2-Br-LIS recently derived from behavioural studies.
Severe peripheral vasoconstriction of the legs due to hypersensitivity to small doses of ergotamine tartrate developed in a patient with migraine headaches. The vasospasm was successfully treated with continuous intra-arterial and intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside. The contribution of angiography in the diagnosis and treatment of ergotism is stressed.
In six double-blind studies involving 182 tests of dietary migraine patients sensitive to tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine, 18% reported headaches from placebos which were all concealed in gelatin capsules.
The purpose of this research was to test a hypothesis: gelatin is partially hydrolysed animal protein; (partially) hydrolysed vegetable protein (PHVP) is known to cause migraine; perhaps the gelatin caused some of the headaches.
The author tested this hypothesis on himself because he suffers from dietary migraine. He proved this in a double-blind test with tyramine hydrochloride (TYH). The amount required for the test was so small (1 mg) that it was tasteless and capsules were unnecessary. The author then undertook tests with a capsule, PHVP, monosodium glutamate (MSG) aspartame (a dipeptide) and TYH, adjusting quantities to give a moderate headache. Samples were mixed with foods to simulate normal eating: the capsule with potato chips, aspartame with orange juice and the rest with cottage cheese or ricotta cheese. Times were measured from ingestion (1) to start of the headache and (2) to maximum headache intensity. Each experiment was repeated three times. The headaches were relieved with caffeine.
Of eight double-blind test samples, the author identified correctly the two placebos and five of the six samples containing tyramine. Quantities giving moderate headaches were: 1 gelatin capsule, 400 mg MSG, 118 mg PHVP, 4.0 mg aspartame and 1.0 mg TYH. Typical times for the three repetitions of the two time periods were 8, 9 and 11 and 17, 19 and 22 min.
Capsules may give headaches to dietary migraine patients that are similar to those from foods. This would explain some of the headaches of patients from placebos. The double-blind test and the repeatability of the time measurements demonstrated the validity of the experiments.
Oxidative stress and zinc release are both known to contribute to neuronal death after hypoglycemia; however, the cause-effect relationships between these events are not established. Here we found, using a rat model of profound hypoglycemia, that the neuronal zinc release and translocation that occur immediately after hypoglycemia are prevented by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 7-nitroindazole but not by overexpression of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1). However, overexpression of SOD-1 prevented activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and neuronal death, suggesting that zinc release is upstream of superoxide production. Accordingly, zinc-induced superoxide production was blocked in neuronal cultures by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin and by genetic deficiency in the p47(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase. A key role for the vesicular zinc pool in this process was suggested by reduced superoxide formation and neuronal death in mice deficient in zinc transporter 3. Together, these findings suggest a series of events in which nitric oxide production triggers vesicular zinc release, which in turn activates NADPH oxidase and PARP-1. This sequence may also occur in other central nervous system disorders in which zinc, nitric oxide, and oxidative stress have been linked.
Inhibition of renal vasodilatory prostaglandins (PGs) and secondary ischemia due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity has been suggested as a possible mechanism for development of analgesic-related renal papillary necrosis (RPN) in rats. Recently, it has been shown that COX exists in two related but unique isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. It is unclear what potential roles these isoforms play in the maintenance of blood flow in the renal papilla or genesis of RPN. We evaluated the effect of 2 papillotoxic agents, including a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin, and a chemical agent, 2-bromoethanamine hydrobromide (2-BEA), on COX-1 and COX-2 in the renal papilla as a means of assessing what changes occur in the expression of these isoforms during the development of RPN. Female Wistar rats approximately 10-17 wk old were treated with either indomethacin (75 mg/kg, single dose, or 10 mg/kg/day for 5 days) or 2-BEA (100 mg/kg/day for 4 days) to create lesions of RPN. In this study, a single 75-mg/kg dose of indomethacin did not cause light microscopic changes of RPN. However, RPN was observed in animals administered indomethacin at 10 mg/kg/day for 1 wk or 2-BEA for 5 days. The immunohistochemical analyses of kidneys showed that both COX-1 and COX-2 were present in the renal papilla of control rats. In animals treated with indomethacin (75 mg/kg), a slight to moderate decrease in both isoforms was observed in essentially normal renal papillary cells within 2 hr, that was followed by an increase in COX-2 immunoreactivity in the renal papilla, macula densa, and thick ascending limbs (both 10- and 75-mg/kg animals). This COX-2 immunoreactivity was greatest in animals with concomitant indomethacin-induced gastrointestinal injury, suggesting a possible role of inflammatory cytokines in COX-2 induction. No changes in the expression of COX isoforms in the intact papilla occurred as a result of 2-BEA; however, cells undergoing degeneration and necrosis lost immunoreactivity to both COX isoforms. The possible mechanism that leads to an initial decrease in COX immunoreactivity in indomethacin-treated animals is not known; however, a reversible ultrastructural change in the papillary cells cannot be ruled out. This decrease in COX isoforms in the renal papilla may contribute to the development of RPN through the loss of vasodilatory PGs.
