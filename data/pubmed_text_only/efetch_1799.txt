Little is known of the environmental factors that initiate and promote disease. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a key regulator of xenobiotic metabolism and plays a major role in gene/environment interactions. The AHR has also been demonstrated to carry out critical functions in development and disease. A qualitative investigation into the contribution by the AHR when stimulated to different levels of activity was undertaken to determine whether AHR-regulated gene/environment interactions are an underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. We used two congenic mouse models differing at the Ahr gene, which encodes AHRs with a 10-fold difference in signaling potencies. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a pervasive environmental toxicant, atherogen, and potent agonist for the AHR, was used as the environmental agent for AHR activation. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the AHR of different signaling potencies by BaP would have differential effects on the physiology and pathology of the mouse cardiovascular system. We found that differential AHR signaling from an exposure to BaP caused lethality in mice with the low-affinity AHR, altered the growth rates of the body and several organs, induced atherosclerosis to a greater extent in mice with the high-affinity AHR, and had a huge impact on gene expression of the aorta. Our studies also demonstrated an endogenous role for AHR signaling in regulating heart size. We report a gene/environment interaction linking differential AHR signaling in the mouse to altered aorta gene expression profiles, changes in body and organ growth rates, and atherosclerosis.
Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in a variety of fruits, exerts a wide range of beneficial effects on the endothelium, regulates multiple vasoactive substances and decreases oxidative stress, factors involved in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension. Our study aimed at evaluating the effects of resveratrol on hepatic and systemic hemodynamics, hepatic endothelial dysfunction, and hepatic fibrosis in CCl₄ cirrhotic rats.
Resveratrol (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) or its vehicle was administered to cirrhotic rats for two weeks and hepatic and systemic hemodynamics were measured. Moreover, we evaluated endothelial function by dose-relaxation curves to acetylcholine, hepatic NO bioavailability and TXA2 production. We also evaluated liver fibrosis by Sirius Red staining of liver sections, collagen-1, NFκB, TGFβ mRNA expression, and desmin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein expression, as a surrogate of hepatic stellate cell activation.
Resveratrol administration significantly decreased portal pressure compared to vehicle (12.1 ± 0.9 vs. 14.3 ± 2.2 mmHg; p <0.05) without significant changes in systemic hemodynamics. Reduction in portal pressure was associated with an improved vasodilatory response to acetylcholine, with decreased TXA2 production, increased endothelial NO, and with a significant reduction in liver fibrosis. The decrease in hepatic fibrosis was associated with a reduced collagen-1, TGFβ, NFκB mRNA expression and desmin and α-SMA protein expression.
Resveratrol administration reduces portal pressure, hepatic stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis, and improves hepatic endothelial dysfunction in cirrhotic rats, suggesting it may be a useful dietary supplement in the treatment of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis.
The intentional adulteration of pet food with melamine and cyanuric acid has been implicated in the kidney failure and death of a large number of cats and dogs in the United States. Although individually these compounds present low toxicity in a range of experimental animals, coexposure can lead to the formation of melamine cyanurate crystals in the nephrons and eventual kidney failure. Given this mode of action, a good understanding of the pharmacokinetic profiles of melamine and cyanuric acid and their combinations is essential to define properly the risk associated with different exposure scenarios. Previous studies have investigated the individual pharmacokinetic profiles of melamine and cyanuric acid. In this work, we report a comparison between the pharmacokinetic profiles of melamine and cyanuric acid administered individually, administered simultaneously as the individual compounds, and administered as a preformed melamine cyanurate complex. Although the oral coadministration of 1 mg/kg body weight of melamine and cyanuric acid did not alter significantly the pharmacokinetic profiles in relation to those determined upon individual oral administration of each compound, the administration of equal amounts of each triazine as the preformed melamine cyanurate complex significantly altered the pharmacokinetics, with reduced bioavailability of both compounds, lower observed maximum serum concentrations, delayed peak concentrations, and prolonged elimination half lives. These results indicate that in order to estimate properly the combined nephrotoxic potential of melamine and cyanuric acid, the experimental design of toxicological experiments and the evaluation of animal or human exposure scenarios should consider the detailed mode of exposure, with particular emphasis on any possible ex vivo formation of melamine cyanurate.
Vorinostat (SAHA, Zolinza), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, is assessed in nonclinical studies to support its approval for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Vorinostat is weakly mutagenic in the Ames assay; is clastogenic in rodent (ie, CHO) cells but not in normal human lymphocytes; and is weakly positive in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. No effects are observed on potassium ion currents in the hERG assay up to 300 microM (safety margin approximately 300-fold the approximately 1 microM serum concentration associated with the 400 mg/d maximum recommended human dose. No rat respiratory or central nervous system effects are found at 150 mg/kg (>2-fold maximum recommended human dose). No cardiovascular effects, including effects on QTc interval, are observed after a single oral dose (150 mg/kg) in dogs. Vorinostat is orally dosed daily in rats (controls, 20, 50, or 150 mg/kg/d) and dogs (controls, 60, 80, or 100/125/160 mg/kg/d) for 26 weeks with a 4-week recovery. Rat vorinostat-related adverse findings are decreased food consumption, weight loss, and hematologic changes; a no observed adverse effects level is not established. In dogs, adverse effects are primarily gastrointestinal; the no observed adverse effects level is 60 mg/kg/d (approximately 6-fold maximum recommended human dose). Toxicities are reversible and can be monitored in the clinic.
The large inspired concentration of sevoflurane (S) during mask induction of anesthesia can induce epileptiform electroencephalogram (EEG) associated with tachycardia. Tachycardia is also seen when the concentration of desflurane (D) is abruptly increased. It is not known whether this is associated with epileptiform EEG similar to S. We studied EEG and heart rate (HR) during rapidly increased concentrations of S or D in 31 females during the postintubation period of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and the tracheas were intubated. Patients were randomized to receive either S or D in nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture after intubation, at a small dose first. After 10 min, S or D vaporizer was advanced to the highest reading of the vaporizer (7% for S, 18% for D) for 5 min. HR and EEG were recorded. Epileptiform EEG activity was recorded in eight of 15 patients in group S and in none in group D (P < 0.05). HR increased in both groups. In group S, HR increased gradually and the highest HR value was 84 bpm at 5 min after the increase in sevoflurane concentration. In group D, HR increased to 93 bpm 2 min after the increase in desflurane concentration (no significant difference, S versus D). A rapid increase in the concentration of S frequently induces epileptiform EEG during normoventilation. Tachycardia during increasing concentrations of D is not associated with epileptiform EEG.
A rapid increase in the concentration of sevoflurane induces epileptiform encephalogram (EEG) with tachycardia. A rapid increase in the concentration of desflurane also induces tachycardia but is not associated with epileptiform EEG.
A 58-year-old patient suffered from severe malabsorption due to agammaglobulinemia. Treated empirically with salicylazosulfapyridine 2--6 g/day, the subjective and objective features of malabsorption regressed. About a year after this treatment she developed a generalized weakness without renewal of the diarrhea; the diagnosis of Heinz body hemolytic anemia was established. In our patient, hemolysis began many months after the commencement of treatment and no deficiency of G6PD or other erythrocyte enzyme or pathological hemoglobin were found.
We studied the bronchodilator effect of a combination of fenoterol (100 micrograms) and ipratropium bromide (40 micrograms) (Duovent) versus salbutamol and placebo in 16 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD). FEV1 and the side-effects (palpitations, tremors, excitation) were measured at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 420 min after administration. The drugs were administered in aerosol form following a randomization schedule. The bronchodilator effect of Duovent was greater than that of salbutamol; moreover, Duovent had a lasting efficacy and few side-effects. Duovent is thus a useful drug therapeutically.
In the rats treated with ACTH or hydrocortisone for 14 days the catalepsy induced by morphine was almost completely inhibited, while the haloperidol induced catalepsy remained unchanged. The morphine induced hypermotility was altered neither by prolonged treatment with ACTH nor by an acute glucocorticoid administration. Inhibition of Na/K ATPase by ouabain led to an increase of striatal acetylcholine (Ach) release, which was enhanced by Met-enkephalin. This effect of the opioid peptide was not demonstrable in the striata of ACTH or hydrocortisone pretreated rats. It is concluded that glucocorticoids are regulatory factors of the striatal opiate neurotransmission possibly via altered receptorial mechanisms.
Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) mobilized with high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic growth factors are now widely used to support myeloablative therapy of multiple myeloma and effect complete remissions in up to 50% of patients with apparent extension of event-free and overall survival. Because tumor cells are present not only in bone marrow, but also in virtually all PBSC harvests, it is conceivable that autografted myeloma cells contribute to relapse after autotransplants. In this study, the kinetics of mobilization of normal hematopoietic stem cells were compared with those of myeloma cells present in PBSC harvests of 12 patients after high-dose cyclophosphamide and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor administration. CD34+ and CD34+Lin-Thy+ stem cell contents were measured by multiparameter flow cytometry, and myeloma cells were quantitated by immunostaining for the relevant Ig light chain and by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the myeloma-specific CDRIII sequence. Results indicated marked heterogeneity in the percentages of mobilized stem cells among different patients (0.1% to 22.2% for CD34+ cells and 0.1% to 7.5% for CD34+Lin-Thy+ cells, respectively). The highest proportions of hematopoietic progenitor cells were observed early during apheresis, with 9 of 12 patients mobilizing adequate amounts of CD34+ cells for 2 autotransplants (> 4 x 10(6)/kg) within the first 2 days, whereas peak levels (percent and absolute numbers) of myeloma cells were present on days 5 and 6 (0.5% to 22.0%). During the last days of collection, mobilized tumor cells exhibited more frequently high labeling index values (1% to 10%; median, 4.4%) and an immature phenotype (CD19+). The differential mobilization observed between normal hematopoietic stem cells and myeloma cells can be exploited to reduce tumor cell contamination in PBSC harvests.
The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy using a fine-powder formulation of cisplatin for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma refractory to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.
We retrospectively examined the data of 84 consecutive patients with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization-refractory hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy with a fine-powder formulation of cisplatin. Cisplatin was administered at the dose of 65 mg/m(2) into the feeding artery of the hepatocellular carcinoma. The treatment was repeated every 4-6 weeks, until the appearance of evidence of tumor progression or of unacceptable toxicity.
Of the 84 patients, one patient (1.2%) showed complete response and two patients (2.4%) showed partial response, representing an overall response rate of 3.6% (95% confidence interval, 0.7-10.1). Of the remaining, 38 patients (45.2%) showed stable disease and 41 (48.8%) showed progressive disease. The median overall survival, 1-year survival rate and median progression-free survival in the entire subject population were 7.1 months, 27% and 1.7 months, respectively. Major Grade 3 or 4 adverse events included thrombocytopenia in 12 patients (14%) and elevation of the serum aspartate aminotransferase in 33 patients (39%). The gastrointestinal toxicities were mild and reversible.
Transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy using a fine-powder formulation of cisplatin appears to have only modest activity, although the toxicity was also only mild, in patients with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization-refractory hepatocellular carcinoma.
Drug-induced liver injury is an important issue for drug development and clinical drug therapy; however, in most cases, it is difficult to predict or prevent these reactions due to a lack of suitable animal models and the unknown mechanisms of action. Phenytoin (DPH) is an anticonvulsant drug that is widely used for the treatment of epilepsy. Some patients who are administered DPH will suffer symptoms of drug-induced liver injury characterized by hepatic necrosis. DPH-induced liver injury occurs in 1 in 1000 or 1 in 10 000 patients. Clinically, 75% of patients who develop liver injury develop a fever and 63% develop a rash. In this study, we established a mouse model for DPH-induced liver injury and analyzed the mechanisms for hepatotoxicity in the presence of immune-related or inflammation-related factors and metabolic activation. Female C57BL/6 mice were administered DPH for 5 days in combination with L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine. Then, the plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were increased, hepatic lesions were observed during the histological evaluations, the hepatic glutathione levels were significantly reduced, and the oxidative stress marker levels were significantly increased. The inhibition of cytochrome P450-dependent oxidative metabolism significantly suppressed the elevated plasma ALT levels and depleted hepatic glutathione. Among the innate immune factors, the hepatic mRNA levels of NACHT, LRR, pyrin domain-containing protein 3, interleukin-1β, and damage-associated molecular patterns were significantly increased. Prostaglandin E₁ treatment ameliorated the hepatic injury caused by DPH. In conclusion, cytochrome P450-dependent metabolic activation followed by the stimulation of the innate immune responses is involved in DPH-induced liver injury.
Afebrile seizures associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis, respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis, influenza infection, asthma, blood transfusions, and intake of a number of drugs (including theophylline, cephalosporins, metronidazole, and acyclovir) with therapeutic drug levels are uncommonly encountered in clinical practice. Reviewed here are the incidence, etiology, clinical presentation, types, diagnosis, associated electroencephalographic changes, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging findings in the literature, as well as management and prognosis of these seizures.
Muscle denervation and concomitant high-dose dexamethasone treatment in rodents produces characteristic pathologic features of severe muscle atrophy and selective myosin heavy filament (MyHC) depletion, identical to those seen in acute quadriplegic myopathy (AQM), also known as critical illness myopathy. We tested the hypothesis that defective pre-translational processes contribute to the atrophy and selective MyHC depletion in this model. We examined the effects of combined glucocorticoid-denervation treatment on MyHC and actin mRNA populations; we also studied mRNA expression of the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), primary transcription factors for MyHC. Adult female rats were subjected to proximal sciatic denervation followed by high-dose dexamethasone (DD) treatment (5 mg/kg body weight daily) for 7 days. Disease controls included rats treated with denervation alone (DN) or dexamethasone alone (DX). At 1 week the plantaris atrophied by approximately 42% in DD muscles. DD treatment resulted in selective MyHC protein depletion; actin protein concentration was not significantly changed. Despite an increase in total RNA concentration in DN and DD muscles, MyHC and actin mRNA concentrations were significantly decreased in these muscles. MyHC mRNA showed a significantly more extensive depletion relative to actin mRNA in DD muscles. Glucocorticoid treatment did not influence a denervation-induced increase in the mRNA expression of the MRFs. We conclude that a deleterious interaction between glucocorticoid and denervation treatments in skeletal muscle is responsible for pre-translational defects that reduce actin and MyHC mRNA substrates in a disproportionate fashion. The resultant selective MyHC depletion contributes to the severe muscle atrophy.
Procedural sedation is a common practice in Emergency Medicine. Propofol has supplanted benzodiazepines in many centers as the drug of choice for procedural sedation. This article reports a case of seizure-like activity in an elderly man undergoing procedural sedation for a fracture reduction. The seizure-like activity was attributed to propofol. A review of the literature is discussed. When using propofol for sedation one should be aware of the risk of seizure-like activity.
This is a case report of severe psychosis and seizures following abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam and then the recurrence of seizures at the end of a gradual tapering schedule. The last of these seizures appeared to be a contributing factor in the patient's death. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first published report of a fatality associated with alprazolam withdrawal.
The cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitor rofecoxib was recently withdrawn because of cardiovascular adverse effects. An increased risk of myocardial infarction had been observed in 2000 in the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research study (VIGOR), but was attributed to cardioprotection of naproxen rather than a cardiotoxic effect of rofecoxib. We used standard and cumulative random-effects meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and observational studies to establish whether robust evidence on the adverse effects of rofecoxib was available before September, 2004.
We searched bibliographic databases and relevant files of the US Food and Drug Administration. We included all randomised controlled trials in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders that compared rofecoxib with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or placebo, and cohort and case-control studies of cardiovascular risk and naproxen. Myocardial infarction was the primary endpoint.
We identified 18 randomised controlled trials and 11 observational studies. By the end of 2000 (52 myocardial infarctions, 20742 patients) the relative risk from randomised controlled trials was 2.30 (95% CI 1.22-4.33, p=0.010), and 1 year later (64 events, 21432 patients) it was 2.24 (1.24-4.02, p=0.007). There was little evidence that the relative risk differed depending on the control group (placebo, non-naproxen NSAID, or naproxen; p=0.41) or trial duration (p=0.82). In observational studies, the cardioprotective effect of naproxen was small (combined estimate 0.86 [95% CI 0.75-0.99]) and could not have explained the findings of the VIGOR trial.
Our findings indicate that rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. The reasons why manufacturer and drug licensing authorities did not continuously monitor and summarise the accumulating evidence need to be clarified.
Anemia has been reported to develop during preoperative chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. The use of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to reduce anemia and subsequent packed red blood cell transfusions. The current study is a report of a Phase III, prospective, randomized trial with or without EPO that confirms the original observations of less anemia and fewer transfusions in those patients randomized to receive EPO concurrently with paclitaxel and carboplatin.
Thirty patients with advanced head and neck or lung carcinoma were treated with 2 courses of paclitaxel, 230 mg/m(2), and carboplatin, 7.5 mg/mL/minute, repeated every 21 days. The treatment group was comprised of 15 patients randomized to receive concurrent EPO, 150 U/kg, 3 times per week; in patients deemed nonresponsive the dose was increased to 300 U/kg and 450 U/kg in subsequent courses. The control group was comprised of 15 patients randomized not to receive EPO.
Twenty-seven patients were evaluable. After 2 courses of chemotherapy the mean hemoglobin decrease was 1.2 g/dL in the EPO group versus 2.8 g/dL in the control group (P = 0.037). There was a highly significant decrease in hemoglobin over time in patients who did not receive EPO (P = 0.008). After 4 courses of chemotherapy, fewer patients were transfused in the EPO arm: 2 of 13 (15%) in the EPO treatment group versus 5 of 14 (36%) in the control group.
There was significantly less anemia and transfusions were reduced by 50% in patients randomized to receive EPO during chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin.
The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) performed a genome-wide association study of late-onset Alzheimer disease using a three-stage design consisting of a discovery stage (stage 1) and two replication stages (stages 2 and 3). Both joint analysis and meta-analysis approaches were used. We obtained genome-wide significant results at MS4A4A (rs4938933; stages 1 and 2, meta-analysis P (P(M)) = 1.7 × 10(-9), joint analysis P (P(J)) = 1.7 × 10(-9); stages 1, 2 and 3, P(M) = 8.2 × 10(-12)), CD2AP (rs9349407; stages 1, 2 and 3, P(M) = 8.6 × 10(-9)), EPHA1 (rs11767557; stages 1, 2 and 3, P(M) = 6.0 × 10(-10)) and CD33 (rs3865444; stages 1, 2 and 3, P(M) = 1.6 × 10(-9)). We also replicated previous associations at CR1 (rs6701713; P(M) = 4.6 × 10(-10), P(J) = 5.2 × 10(-11)), CLU (rs1532278; P(M) = 8.3 × 10(-8), P(J) = 1.9 × 10(-8)), BIN1 (rs7561528; P(M) = 4.0 × 10(-14), P(J) = 5.2 × 10(-14)) and PICALM (rs561655; P(M) = 7.0 × 10(-11), P(J) = 1.0 × 10(-10)), but not at EXOC3L2, to late-onset Alzheimer's disease susceptibility.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by endothelial damage, neutrophil infiltration, and microvascular thrombosis. Products of the coagulation cascade, particularly thrombin, activate the endothelium with resulting polymorphonuclear neutrophil accumulation and thrombosis. This study assessed the changes in lung tissue endothelial thrombomodulin (TM) expression in a rat model of zymosan-induced remote lung injury.
Rats were randomized into three groups: control, low-dose intraperitoneal zymosan, and high-dose intraperitoneal zymosan. The animals were killed 28 days later. Lungs were assessed for histopathology, immunohistochemically stained for TM, and analyzed for TM mRNA.
Animals developed a triphasic illness with ARDS in phase III. The lungs demonstrated normal TM immunoreactivity in areas of noninflamed lung but an almost complete absence of TM in areas of inflammation. Tissue TM mRNA decreased in association with the dose of zymosan.
Zymosan-induced lung injury is associated with decreased TM expression in areas of injury. This finding may be of pathophysiologic significance in human ARDS, and it needs to be further explored. We hypothesize that down-regulation of TM leads to a hypercoagulable endothelium, increased microvascular thrombosis, and subsequent lung injury.
We sought to identify new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease through a staged association study (GERAD+) and by testing suggestive loci reported by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC) in a companion paper. We undertook a combined analysis of four genome-wide association datasets (stage 1) and identified ten newly associated variants with P ≤ 1 × 10(-5). We tested these variants for association in an independent sample (stage 2). Three SNPs at two loci replicated and showed evidence for association in a further sample (stage 3). Meta-analyses of all data provided compelling evidence that ABCA7 (rs3764650, meta P = 4.5 × 10(-17); including ADGC data, meta P = 5.0 × 10(-21)) and the MS4A gene cluster (rs610932, meta P = 1.8 × 10(-14); including ADGC data, meta P = 1.2 × 10(-16)) are new Alzheimer's disease susceptibility loci. We also found independent evidence for association for three loci reported by the ADGC, which, when combined, showed genome-wide significance: CD2AP (GERAD+, P = 8.0 × 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 8.6 × 10(-9)), CD33 (GERAD+, P = 2.2 × 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 1.6 × 10(-9)) and EPHA1 (GERAD+, P = 3.4 × 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 6.0 × 10(-10)).
It is well known that vasodilating antihypertensive drugs induce intracranial hypertension. A considerable number of papers have reported nitroglycerin-induced ICP elevation during anesthetized operations. However, except for Gagnon's report, most papers dealt with normal patients. Our study, using an extradural pressure transducer clinically, deals with the nitroglycerin drip infusion and its effect on high ICP state. Mean ICP value before infusion was 42 mmHg+ 14.8 (N = 10). Three cases out of ten showed ICP elevation corresponding with blood pressure depression. Six cases out of ten revealed ICP depression corresponding with blood pressure depression. One case did not show any difference in ICP. There was a statistically significant difference between the ICP elevated group and the depressed group. These results suggest that very high ICP state, like vasomotor paralysis, does not have a potential to open the vascular bed in the cranium and blood pressure depression induced by nitroglycerin infusion causes ICP depression. We would like to conclude that nitroglycerin can be used for postoperative blood pressure control even in the neurosurgical field.
It is well documented that ifosfamide (IFO) therapy is associated with sever nephropathy in the form of Fanconi syndrome. Although oxidative stress has been reported as a major player in IFO-induced Fanconi syndrome, no mechanism for this effect has been ascertained. Therefore, this study has been initiated to investigate, on gene expression level, the mechanism of IFO-induce nephrotoxicity and those whereby carnitine supplementation attenuates this serious side effect of IFO. To achieve the ultimate goals of this study, adult male rats were assigned to one of four treatment groups, namely, control, L-carnitine, IFO, and IFO plus L-carnitine. Administration of IFO for 5 days significantly increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and total nitrate/nitrite (NOx) production in kidney tissues. In addition, IFO significantly increased mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), caspase-9, and caspase-3 and significantly decreased expression of glutathione peroxides (GPx), catalase (CAT), and Bcl2 in kidney tissues. Administration of L-carnitine to IFO-treated rats resulted in a complete reversal of the all biochemical and gene expression changes, induced by IFO, to the control values. Data from this study suggest that L-carnitine prevents the development of IFO-induced nephrotoxicity via downregulation of oxidative and nitrosative apoptotic signaling in kidney tissues.
We report the history of a 39-year-old-man who suffered from refractory arterial hypertension and who was referred to us for the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma due to increased urinary free catecholamines. The work-up revealed the diagnosis of cocaine-induced arterial hypertension. The pathogenesis of cocaine-induced arterial hypertension as well as the differential diagnosis of increased urinary catecholamines will be discussed.
