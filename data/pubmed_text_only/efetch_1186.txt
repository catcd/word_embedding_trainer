Isoniazid (INH) is an effective treatment for tuberculosis and among the most common causes of drug-induced seizures in the United States. Isoniazid intoxication produces a characteristic clinical syndrome including seizures, metabolic acidosis, and, in severe cases, respiratory depression and coma.
A 10-month-old male infant was presented after being found with his father's INH. The patient was brought to a local hospital where he had a witnessed generalized seizure and was given 650 mg pyridoxine intravenously, which was based on a 70 mg/kg recommendation. Five hours after the time of ingestion, the patient developed recurrent generalized seizures. He was given diazepam and then loaded with phenobarbital 20 mg/kg, while awaiting more pyridoxine from the pharmacy. He received an additional 2 g pyridoxine for a suspected ingestion of approximately 2.7 g INH (290 mg/kg total dose), and his seizures subsequently resolved.
Treatment of INH toxicity must address correction of gamma-aminobutyric acid deficiency with pyridoxine replacement and management of life-threatening events. For poisonings in which the amount of INH ingested is known, pyridoxine is dosed on a gram-for-gram basis. Several reference textbooks recommend pyridoxine dosing in children to be 70 mg/kg. This was the justification for the initial pyridoxine dose administered in our case. However, after review of the referenced literature, the rationale supporting this recommendation remains unclear. Benzodiazepines should also be given with pyridoxine as they have been shown to have a synergistic effect in terminating seizures in animal models.
As soon as possible after INH overdose is suspected or diagnosed, pyridoxine should be administered in a dose approximately equal to the estimated amount of INH ingested regardless of the age of the patient.
Nephrin is identified as a product of the gene mutated in a patient with congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type. To analyse the function of nephrin and the relationship of nephrin and the target antigen of nephritogenic anti-rat slit diaphragm monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5-1-6, the rat homologue of nephrin was cloned. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat nephrin shows 82.2% homology to human nephrin. Signal sequences of rat nephrin are 36 amino acids, whereas those of human nephrin are reported to be 22 amino acids. The localization of rat nephrin always coincided with that of mAb 5-1-6 antigen. The specific anti-nephrin antibody recognized the mAb 5-1-6-antigen complex. mAb 5-1-6 reacted with COS cells transfected with rat nephrin cDNA. These results demonstrate that nephritogenic mAb 5-1-6 identifies the extracellular domain of rat nephrin, thereby documenting that nephrin is a functional protein of the slit diaphragm. The staining pattern of nephrin shifted from a linear-like pattern to a discontinuous coarse granular pattern not only in mAb 5-1-6-induced nephropathy, but also in puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy, adriamycin nephropathy and passive Heymann nephropathy. Rat nephrin is detected first on the basal and lateral side below the junctional complex at the S-shaped body stage. With the interdigitation of foot processes, nephrin becomes concentrated in the slit pore, and finally restricted in the site of the slit diaphragm bridging two adjacent foot processes.
This double-blind study examined the efficacy and safety of replacing entacapone with tolcapone in fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Patients receiving entacapone for > or =15 days were randomly assigned to continue entacapone (n = 75) or switch to tolcapone (n = 75) and were followed up for 3 weeks. Efficacy measures included changes in on time (without disabling dyskinesia) and an investigator's global assessment (IGA). The on time increased by > or =1 hour/day (primary efficacy measure) in 43% of entacapone-treated patients and 53% of tolcapone-treated patients, and by > or =3 hours/day in 13% and 25%, respectively. The IGA indicated moderate/marked improvements in 25% of entacapone patients and 39% receiving tolcapone. Response rates (the proportion of patients with > or =1 hour/day increase in on time and improvements on IGA) were 17% with entacapone and 32% with tolcapone. Dyskinesia was the most common adverse event affecting 29% of entacapone and 31% of tolcapone recipients. One patient in each group had elevated liver enzymes, resulting in treatment withdrawal (levels returned to normal thereafter in both cases). In conclusion, within the limits of the protocol, there was a tendency for tolcapone to offer enhanced efficacy in patients with fluctuating PD, despite optimized entacapone therapy. Tolcapone can be considered, therefore, for patients whose motor fluctuations are inadequately controlled by their existing regimen.
Resveratrol, an edible polyphenolic stilbene, has been reported to possess substantial antileukemic activities in different leukemia cell lines. We investigated whether resveratrol is active against fresh acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and its mechanism of action. Because interleukin 1beta(IL-1beta) plays a key role in proliferation of AML cells, we first tested the effect of resveratrol on the AML cell lines OCIM2 and OCI/AML3, both of which produce IL-1beta and proliferate in response to it. Resveratrol inhibited proliferation of both cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion (5-75 microM) by arresting the cells at S phase, thus preventing their progression through the cell cycle; IL-1beta partially reversed this inhibitory effect. Resveratrol significantly reduced production of IL-1beta in OCIM2 cells. It also suppressed the IL-1beta-induced activation of transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which modulates an array of signals controlling cellular survival, proliferation, and cytokine production. Indeed, incubation of OCIM2 cells with resveratrol resulted in apoptotic cell death. Because caspase inhibitors Ac-DEVD-CHO or z-DEVD-FMK partially reversed the antiproliferative effect of resveratrol, we tested its effect on the caspase pathway and found that resveratrol induced the activation of the cysteine protease caspase 3 and subsequent cleavage of the DNA repair enzyme poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase. Finally, resveratrol suppressed colony-forming cell proliferation of fresh AML marrow cells from 5 patients with newly diagnosed AML in a dose-dependent fashion. Taken together, our data showing that resveratrol is an effective in vitro inhibitor of AML cells suggest that this compound may have a role in future therapies for AML.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features and frequency of autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome (AS; according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition [DSM-IV] criteria) in children exposed to anticonvulsant medication in utero. During a 20-year study period, 626 children were born in Aberdeen to mothers taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The study examined long-term effects of prenatal exposure to AEDs in 260 children (122 males, 138 females). Of these, 26 (16 males) were reported by parents to have social or behavioural difficulties. Eleven children (6 males, 5 females) fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder and one (female) fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for AS. These children comprised 4.6% of the exposed children studied, and 1.9% of all exposed children born during the study period. Mean age of these children at diagnosis was 5 years 4 months (SD 2y 11mo) and 9 years 10 months (SD 3y 10mo) at the time of this study. Other children from the group of 26 had difficulties in areas of speech and language development and social communication but did not meet the criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Sodium valproate was the drug most commonly associated with autistic disorder, five of 56 (8.9%) of the study children exposed to sodium valproate alone had either autistic disorder or AS. It was concluded that prenatal exposure to anticonvulsant medication is a risk factor for the development of an ASD. Fetal anticonvulsant syndrome associated autistic disorder is characterized by an even sex ratio, absence of regression or skill loss, and language delay in the absence of global delay.
Podocytes have been shown to express classical cadherins in the early stage of glomerulogenesis, but it remains unclear whether podocytes in normal and pathological conditions express cadherins in the adult stage. To address this question, rat podocytes in the neonate, the adult and in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against alpha- and beta-catenins and anti-pan-cadherin antibody, and by immunoelectron microscopy using anti-alpha-catenin antibody. In the neonate, all the antibodies reacted with the junctional complex of podocytes in the S-shaped body stage. The staining disappeared during the capillary loop stage, when foot processes and slit diaphragms are formed. In the adult, podocytes were not stained with any of the antibodies, whereas distinct staining with the antibodies was detected in endothelial cells and mesangial cells in the glomerulus. These findings were identical in kidneys of PAN nephrosis; podocytes did not show any significant staining. These results indicate that the composition of intercellular junction molecules of podocytes in the adult is different from that of immature podocytes even under the pathological condition.
Residential proximity to applications of agricultural pesticides may be an important source of exposure to agents that have been classified as developmental toxins. Data on two case-control study populations of infants with neural tube defects (NTDs) and nonmalformed controls delivered in California between 1987 and 1991 were pooled to investigate whether maternal residential proximity to applications of specific pesticides or physicochemical groups of pesticides during early gestation increases the risk of these malformations. Maternal residential proximity within 1,000 m of pesticide applications was ascertained by linking mothers' addresses with agricultural pesticide use reports and crop maps. Odds ratios were computed by using conventional single- and multiple-pesticide and hierarchical multiple-pesticide logistic regression. In single-pesticide models, several pesticides were associated with NTDs after adjustment for study population, maternal ethnicity, educational level, cigarette smoking, and vitamin use. In a hierarchical multiple-pesticide model, effect estimates for only benomyl and methomyl suggested a possible association. Elevated risks of NTDs and anencephaly or spina bifida subtypes were also associated with exposures to chemicals classified as amide, benzimidazole, methyl carbamate, or organophosphorus pesticides and with increasing numbers of pesticides. These results suggest that ambient exposure to certain categories of agricultural pesticides may increase the risk of NTDs.
Agropesticides impart high risks of exposure for animals including humans. This work analysed the effect of parathion upon protein synthesis in seminiferous tubules cultured in vitro from adult male CF1 mice. They were incubated with parathion solutions (0.8, 0.4, 0.04, 0.004, 0.0004 mM) for 5 h. One hour after ending incubation tritiated leucine was added to each sample. In addition, groups treated with 0.8 mM parathion were incubated for 5 h, and thereafter transferred to a parathion-free medium; tritiated leucine incorporation was measured 1, 2, or 3 h afterwards. Results of protein synthesis denote an inhibitory dose-dependent effect of parathion. This is reversed after pesticide-free incubation. Testicular protein synthesis inhibition induced by parathion may compromise male fertility in view of the fact that, in spermatogenesis, proliferation (mitosis, meiosis) and cell differentiation occurs.
SCH 23390 induced only a negligible incidence of the acute dyskinetic syndrome, a predictor of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal liability, in squirrel monkeys. However, haloperidol-induced dyskinesias were potentiated by SCH 23390 and were blocked by the D-1 agonist, SKF 38393. When administered orally or intraperitoneally to mice, SCH 23390 showed a considerably wider dose separation than did conventional neuroleptics between antagonism of apomorphine climbing and antagonism of stereotyped sniffing. Clinically relevant distinctions may exist between D-1 and D-2 antagonists, with D-1 antagonists (exemplified by SCH 23390) showing lower, although possibly not negligible, potential to cause extrapyramidal side effects.
Primary hypomagnesaemia is composed of a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by renal or intestinal Mg(2+) wasting, often associated with disturbances in Ca(2+) excretion. We identified a putative dominant-negative mutation in the gene encoding the Na(+), K(+)-ATPase gamma-subunit (FXYD2), leading to defective routing of the protein in a family with dominant renal hypomagnesaemia.
The influence of ethanol (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg i.p.) on the Bezold-Jarisch reflex in urethane-anaesthetized rats was studied. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT; 1, 3, 10 and 30 micrograms/kg i.v.) and capsaicin (1, 3 and 10 micrograms/kg i.v.) reflexly decreased heart rate in a dose-dependent manner. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron 10 micrograms/kg i.v. abolished the 5-HT- but not the capsaicin-stimulated bradycardia, indicating that 5-HT and capsaicin acted via different trigger mechanisms (5-HT3 receptor-dependent and -independent, respectively). Ethanol at 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg i.p. inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (by 20-45%) the 5-HT- but not the capsaicin-stimulated decrease in heart rate. Our results demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of ethanol on the 5-HT3 receptor-mediated Bezold-Jarisch reflex may be related to the direct effect of ethanol on 5-HT3 receptors on sensory vagal nerves in the heart.
While rapidly spreading "crack" addiction is a major concern in our community, current research in this area is focused mainly on adolescents and young adults. We discuss a case of crack addiction developing for the first time in an elderly person and subsequent complications. We believe no such cases have been previously reported. We hope this will be helpful to practicing clinicians and stimulate research to understand cocaine and crack abuse patterns in the elderly.
A case is presented involving a female patient who experienced rhabdomyolysis following high-dose therapy with a statin. Acute renal failure was a complicating factor necessitating the use of hemodialysis. The patient recovered fully within about 6 weeks.
The major antihypertensive effect of losartan, a nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist, is thought to be due to inhibition of the pressor effects of angiotensin II. It is possible, however, that losartan alters the synthesis of vasodilator or vasoconstrictor prostaglandins (PG), thus contributing to its antihypertensive effect. Sixteen postmenopausal women with essential hypertension, with a mean age of 59 years and diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 115 mm Hg, were enrolled in a 12-week, single-blind study to determine the effects of losartan on blood pressure, renal and extrarenal PG production, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone, and routine biochemical parameters. The subjects received placebo during weeks 1 to 4, 50 mg losartan daily during weeks 5 to 8, and placebo during weeks 9 to 12. During the 4-week treatment period, there were no significant, sustained changes in renal or extrarenal synthesis of PGE2, PGI2, or thromboxane A2. Losartan significantly reduced systolic blood pressure from 155 +/- 11 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 139 +/- 13 mm Hg (P = .001) and diastolic blood pressure from 100 +/- 2 mm Hg to 87 +/- 5 mm Hg (P < .001) despite the fact that the majority of patients had low PRA. Plasma aldosterone concentration decreased from 9.7 +/- 6.5 ng/dL to 5.1 +/- 3.9 ng/dL (P = .002) and serum uric acid declined from 4.6 +/- 0.8 mg/dL to 4.2 +/- 0.8 mg/dL (P = .018) after 4 weeks of treatment with losartan. We conclude that 1) losartan decreases blood pressure in women with essential hypertension and low plasma renin activity; 2) the antihypertensive effect is not associated with sustained changes in renal or extrarenal PG production; and 3) losartan reduces plasma aldosterone and serum uric acid concentrations in patients with essential hypertension.
The molecular basis of chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF) has remained elusive, thus hampering the development of effective targeted therapies. However, significant progress regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenes is of this disease has been made in recent years that will likely provide ample opportunity for the investigation of novel therapeutic approaches. At the fore front of these advances is the discovery that 35%-55% of patients with CIMF harbor mutations in the Janus kinase 2 tyrosine kinase gene. Until very recently, the management of patients with CIMF involved the use of supportive measures, including growth factors, transfusions, or interferon, and the administration of cyto-reductive agents, such as hydroxyurea and anagrelide. However, several trials have demonstrated the efficacy of antiangiogenic agents alone or in combination with corticosteroids. In addition, the use of reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation has resulted in prolonged survival and lower transplant-related mortality.
We report the case of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who, after the initiation of treatment with vincristine (VCR), developed a fulminant motor polyradiculoneuropathy resembling an axonal variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). This report shows that differentiating between axonal GBS and VCR-induced acute neurotoxicity may be a challenge for clinicians.
Tumor resistance to alkylating agents such as carmustine (BCNU) has been found to be associated with intracellular expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Administration of O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG), a substrate that inactivates MGMT, may help overcome chemotherapy resistance. We performed a phase II study to explore the activity of O6-BG in combination with BCNU in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.
Informed consent was obtained from patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma naïve to systemic chemotherapy (adjuvant chemotherapy allowed). Patients received O6-BG 120 mg/m2 I.V. followed by BCNU 40 mg/m2 I.V. Treatment was repeated every 6 weeks until disease progression or development of unacceptable toxicity.
No objective responses were observed in 12 enrolled patients. Four patients exhibited stable disease lasting 11-25+ weeks. The median overall survival was 16.9 months (95% CI, 2.9-NR). The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Depletion of MGMT activity was demonstrated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Immunohistochemical estimation of MGMT expression from archival tissue ranged from 20 to 99% positive staining cells.
Observed toxicities were consistent with previous studies of O6-BG plus BCNU. The degree of MGMT expression was variable in this small sample of heterogeneous sarcomas. Further development of this regimen and dose for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma is not warranted due to the lack of objective responses.
The Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) was terminated 21 months ahead of schedule due to an excess of lung cancers. Deaths from cardiovascular disease also increased (relative risk=1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.61)) in the group assigned to a combination of 30 mg beta-carotene and 25 000 IU retinyl palmitate (vitamin A) daily. The basis for increased cardiovascular mortality is unexplained.
We analyzed data on serum lipids, available for 1474 CARET Vanguard participants who were enrolled in the two CARET pilot studies and transitioned to the Vanguard study. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured 2 months prior to, 4 and 12 months following randomization, and annually thereafter for up to 7 y.
In the asbestos-exposed pilot (N = 816), participants were assigned to beta-carotene and retinol or to placebo; in the smokers pilot (N = 1029), participants were assigned to beta-carotene, retinol, a combination, or placebo.
Serum cholesterol showed a decline over time in both arms; serum triglycerides had a continuous decline over time in the placebo arm, but an initial increase that persisted in the active arm. Both serum cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.0003) and serum triglycerides (P < 0.0001) were significantly higher in the participants receiving vitamin A and/or a combination of vitamin A and beta-carotene (n = 863) as compared to the placebo group (n = 611). Those in this active intervention group had an average cholesterol concentration 5.3 mg/dl (0.137 mmol/l) higher than those in the placebo arm.
The differences in cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations between the groups following randomization may account in part for the unexpected excess in cardiovascular deaths seen in the active intervention arm of CARET.
Ofloxacin, a quinolone, is an extensively used, well-tolerated antibacterial agent but has been reported to induce photosensitivity at low incidences. In the present investigation, the possible role of oxidative stress in ofloxacin-induced retinopathy in rabbits was evaluated. It was observed that ofloxacin at a dose rate of 10 and 20 mg/rabbit, twice daily for 21 consecutive days, resulted in significant elevation in the extent of lipid peroxidation and depletion of the blood glutathione levels. Marked alterations were also observed in various parameters of the glutathione-redox cycle. There was significant increase in the enzymic activity of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, whereas a significant decrease was observed in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase enzymes. Histopathological studies revealed retinal damage especially in the pigmented cell layer. Degenerative changes in liver and kidneys were also observed. Liver showed focal areas of necrosis, dilation of sinusoids, and cellular infiltration, whereas in kidneys, there was glomerular and tubular degeneration, suggesting impaired renal functioning.
All vertebrates display a characteristic asymmetry of internal organs with the cardiac apex, stomach and spleen towards the left, and the liver and gall bladder on the right. Left-right (L-R) axis abnormalities or laterality defects are common in humans (1 in 8,500 live births). Several genes (such as Nodal, Ebaf and Pitx2) have been implicated in L-R organ positioning in model organisms. In humans, relatively few genes have been associated with a small percentage of human situs defects. These include ZIC3 (ref. 5), LEFTB (formerly LEFTY2; ref. 6) and ACVR2B (encoding activin receptor IIB; ref. 7). The EGF-CFC genes, mouse Cfc1 (encoding the Cryptic protein; ref. 9) and zebrafish one-eyed pinhead (oep; refs 10, 11) are essential for the establishment of the L-R axis. EGF-CFC proteins act as co-factors for Nodal-related signals, which have also been implicated in L-R axis development. Here we identify loss-of-function mutations in human CFC1 (encoding the CRYPTIC protein) in patients with heterotaxic phenotypes (randomized organ positioning). The mutant proteins have aberrant cellular localization in transfected cells and are functionally defective in a zebrafish oep-mutant rescue assay. Our findings indicate that the essential role of EGF-CFC genes and Nodal signalling in left-right axis formation is conserved from fish to humans. Moreover, our results support a role for environmental and/or genetic modifiers in determining the ultimate phenotype in humans.
The response of pregnant marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to the thalidomide derivative EM 12 was evaluated. EM 12 was selected for these studies because it is more active than thalidomide and is much more stable for hydrolysis. Skeletal gross structural abnormalities were observed when EM 12 was given to marmosets for 3-7 days during the period between days 49 and 60 post ovulation. Using the treatment schedule finally adapted in our laboratory, i.e. treatment during days 51-57 post ovulation, doses of 5 (or 10) mg EM 12/kg body wt induced the typical limb abnormalities known from man with an 80-100% certainty. In some animals we could observe the typical pattern of abnormalities even with doses as low as 1 mg EM 12/kg body wt. Abnormalities of the skeleton induced during this sensitive period are described. None of these (except some bifurcations of ribs) were seen in any of the ten litters (23 fetuses) serving as controls during the period of the study.
The development of HIV protease inhibitors has dramatically improved the treatment prognosis of HIV-infected patients. The treatment, however, is associated with the potential for adverse events that are unique to protease inhibitors. One of them, Indinavir, can lead to the development of urinary stones. Three weeks after starting treatment with Indinavir, Zidovudine and Lamivudine, a 66-year-old patient developed symptomatic hydronephrosis on the right side due to multiple Indinavir stones blocking the ureter. Microhematuria and characteristic crystals were found in the urine. After interruption of treatment and increased fluid intake, the crystallurea was not longer detectable and the patient became asymptomatic within 3 days. Nephrostomy and ureteral stent placement were not necessary. Patients on treatment with Indinavir are required to maintain a fluid intake of at least 1.5-2 l/day to reduce the risk of crystallization and urinary stones. Pharmacologic metaphylaxis to prevent crystallization is not recommended.
Neurological examinations of 27 outpatients receiving lithium carbonate maintenance therapy for recurrent affective illness revealed that most of the patients receiving lithium for more than 8 months had cogwheel rigidity. The data suggest a positive correlation between the duration of lithium maintenance and the severity of cogwheeling. Intravenous administration of benztropine, an antiparkinsonian drug, did not abolish or significantly ameliorate this symptom.
Oxycodone and oxycodone-containing analgesics are often used for the relief of pain. In the presence of renal dysfunction, the half-life of oxycodone and metabolites can be prolonged. We describe the case of a 41-year-old chronic hemodialysis patient who received multiple doses of oxycodone/acetaminophen resulting in accumulation of the medication and consequent lethargy, hypotension and respiratory depression. These adverse effects were reversed with multiple bolus doses of naloxone, followed by a continuous infusion administered for 45 hours. Utilizing the Naranjo probability scale, the patient had a "probable" adverse drug reaction to the oxycodone. Oxycodone should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal failure.
