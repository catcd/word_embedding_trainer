We report a case of a 70-year-old man who developed Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), diagnosed by characteristic histological findings, clinical presentations of mononeuritis multiplex, and multiple small intestinal ulcers with perforations, after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. The patient had developed asthma at age of 45, treated with oral prednisolone (10-20 mg daily) from that time. At the age of 70 he developed pneumonia. The condition responded to antibiotics, and the corticosteroid was quickly tapered and discontinued. He was never given leukotriene receptor antagonists during the course of treatment. Approximately two weeks after discontinuation of steroid therapy, he developed severe abdominal pain and mononeuritis multiplex, confirmed by nerve conduction studies. Laboratory evaluation revealed an eosinophil count of 30,450/microliter, and P-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was positive. An abdominal CT scan revealed free air in the abdominal cavity. Laparotomy revealed multiple small intestinal ulcers with perforations. Histologic examination of the intestine showed eosinophilic vasculitis and fibrinoid necrosis. Treatment with systemic corticosteroid (prednisolone 60 mg daily) led to a clinical improvement of neurological and gastroenterological deficits. The prednisolone dose was tapered to 20 mg daily without disease flares. Recently, there have been several reports of CSS that manifested after withdrawal of steroid therapy. CSS can be precipitated in patients with adult-onset, steroid-dependent bronchial asthma after corticosteroid withdrawal.
We report here a very unusual patient with Polycythemia vera treated with Pipobroman who developed severe aplastic anemia following administration of the drug. Six months later, because of lack of response, cyclosporine therapy was given there was rapid and complete hematological recovery, highly suggestive of an immune-mediated mechanism, in this case.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether resveratrol adds to the growth inhibitory effects of cisplatin and doxorubicin on ovarian and uterine cancer cells and to evaluate whether resveratrol diminishes the cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin in rodent heart.
Human ovarian (OVCAR-3) and uterine (Ishikawa) cancer cells in culture were treated with cisplatin and doxorubicin, respectively, with and without resveratrol; and cell growth and viability were evaluated. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes received doxorubicin in the presence and absence of resveratrol, and cell viability was evaluated. Mice received doxorubicin +/- resveratrol, and electrocardiograms were evaluated. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance and Scheffe's test.
Resveratrol combined with cisplatin or with doxorubicin demonstrated an additive growth-inhibitory anticancer effect with a left shift of the cisplatin and doxorubicin dose/response curves. Resveratrol increased the viability of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes that were treated with doxorubicin and reduced doxorubicin-induced bradycardia and QTc interval prolongation in mice.
Resveratrol adds to the growth inhibitory/anticancer activity of cisplatin and doxorubicin in vitro and protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity both in vitro and in mice.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) are administered to patients to induce and control hypotension during anesthesia. SNP is authorized for clinical use in USA and UK, and ATP is clinically used in other countries such as Japan. We investigated how these two drugs act on the cardiovascular systems of 20 dogs whose hearts had been denervated by a procedure we had devised. ATP (10 dogs) or SNP (10 dogs) was administered to reduce mean arterial pressure by 30% to 70% of control. Before, during and after induced hypotension, we measured major cardiovascular parameters. Hypotension induced by ATP was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.001), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.001), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), total body oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05), and heart rate (p less than 0.001); all these variables returned normal within 30 min after ATP was stopped. Cardiac output did not change. During hypotension produced by SNP similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.01), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), and oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood (p less than 0.05), while heart rate (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.05) were increased. Recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after SNP had been stopped. Both ATP and SNP should act on the pacemaker tissue of the heart.
About 20-30% of hormone-independent PCa are characterized by the extensive loss of AR expression that appears to occur at the transcriptional level. Treatment of AR-negative PCa cells with demethylating agents (Aza-CR) leads to expression of AR mRNA and protein. Here, we investigate the effect of Aza-CR administered both acutely and chronically on AR expression, PSA expression, cell survival, and proliferation in androgen-independent/AR-negative PCa cells. We also studied whether epigenetically reactivated AR is a target for bicalutamide therapy.
The in vitro effect of Aza-CR as single agent and its ability to induce AR expression and to augment the efficacy to bicalutamide were assessed using two androgen-independent and AR-negative cell lines (PC3 and DU145).
Our results show that acute treatment (4 days) with Aza-CR results in a relatively low decrease in cell proliferation with G2 cell cycle arrest and no significant evidence of apoptosis or AR expression. Interestingly, when Aza-CR was chronically administered (20 days), this treatment resulted in marked decrease in tumor cell proliferation with significant increase in AR and PSA protein levels. Furthermore, following Aza-CR chronic treatment the formerly androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 cells increase their susceptibility to the apoptotic effects of bicalutamide.
Aza-CR acute treatment has modest effects on androgen-independent and AR-negative PCa cell survival and proliferation, but chronic administration results in profound decrease in proliferation and in sensitization to antiandrogen agents. All these effects seem, in some measure, dependent on a partial restoration of androgen regulation.
Cholesterol gallstones are more common in women than men, and exposure to oral contraceptive steroids and conjugated estrogens increases the risk for gallstones. It is hypothesized that estrogen enhances cholesterol cholelithogenesis by augmenting functions of hepatic estrogen receptors (ERs).
To investigate molecular mechanisms of how estrogen influences cholesterol gallstones, we studied gonadectomized AKR/J mice of both genders that were implanted subcutaneously with pellets releasing 17beta-estradiol at 0, 3, or 6 microg/day and that were fed a lithogenic diet for 12 weeks. To test the hypothesis that ERs play a pivotal role in mediating lithogenic actions of estrogen and to dissect the potential pathophysiologic roles of each receptor subtype, ERalpha and ERbeta, in the formation of gallstones, we investigated gonadectomized mice treated with synthetic ER subtype-selective agonists or antagonists.
17beta-estradiol promoted gallstone formation by up-regulating hepatic expression of ERalpha but not ERbeta, and the lithogenic actions of estrogen can be blocked completely by the antiestrogenic ICI 182,780. The ERalpha-selective agonist propylpyrazole, but not the ERbeta-selective agonist diarylpropionitrile, augmented hepatic cholesterol output that resulted in cholesterol supersaturated bile and gallstones. Similar to the 17beta-estradiol treatment, tamoxifen significantly increased biliary cholesterol secretion and gallstone prevalence in both gonadectomized females and males.
The hepatic ERalpha, but not ERbeta, plays a critical role in 17beta-estradiol-induced cholesterol gallstones. Our findings may offer a new approach to treat gallstones by inhibiting hepatic ER activity with a liver-specific, ERalpha-selective antagonist.
The beneficial effects of beta-blockers and aldosterone receptor antagonists are now well established in patients with severe systolic chronic heart failure (CHF). However, it is unclear whether beta-blockers are able to provide additional benefit in patients already receiving aldosterone antagonists. We therefore examined this question in the COPERNICUS study of 2289 patients with severe CHF receiving the beta1-beta2/alpha1 blocker carvedilol compared with placebo.
Patients were divided post hoc into subgroups according to whether they were receiving spironolactone (n = 445) or not (n = 1844) at baseline. Consistency of the effect of carvedilol versus placebo was examined for these subgroups with respect to the predefined end points of all-cause mortality, death or CHF-related hospitalizations, death or cardiovascular hospitalizations, and death or all-cause hospitalizations.
The beneficial effect of carvedilol was similar among patients who were or were not receiving spironolactone for each of the 4 efficacy measures. For all-cause mortality, the Cox model hazard ratio for carvedilol compared with placebo was 0.65 (95% CI 0.36-1.15) in patients receiving spironolactone and 0.65 (0.51-0.83) in patients not receiving spironolactone. Hazard ratios for death or all-cause hospitalization were 0.76 (0.55-1.05) versus 0.76 (0.66-0.88); for death or cardiovascular hospitalization, 0.61 (0.42-0.89) versus 0.75 (0.64-0.88); and for death or CHF hospitalization, 0.63 (0.43-0.94) versus 0.70 (0.59-0.84), in patients receiving and not receiving spironolactone, respectively. The safety and tolerability of treatment with carvedilol were also similar, regardless of background spironolactone.
Carvedilol remained clinically efficacious in the COPERNICUS study of patients with severe CHF when added to background spironolactone in patients who were practically all receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (or angiotensin II antagonist) therapy. Therefore, the use of spironolactone in patients with severe CHF does not obviate the necessity of additional treatment that interferes with the adverse effects of sympathetic activation, specifically beta-blockade.
We sought to determine whether cyclooxygenase (COX) activity is necessary for overload-induced growth of adult rat skeletal muscle, and whether nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity is involved in upregulation of COX messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in skeletal muscle.
Unilateral surgical removal of the gastrocnemius and soleus was performed on the right hindlimb of 16 female Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 230 g) to induce chronic overload (OL) of the plantaris for 14 d, with sham surgeries performed on the contralateral leg as a normally loaded (NL) control. Half of the rats were treated with the nonspecific COX inhibitor, ibuprofen (0.2 mg.mL(-1) in drinking water; approximately 20 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)). In a second experiment, the plantaris was unilaterally overloaded for 5 or 14 d in male rats (approximately 350 g; N = 16 rats per time point) and half of the animals were treated with the NOS inhibitor, L-NAME (0.75 mg.mL(-1) in drinking water; approximately 90 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)).
Ibuprofen treatment inhibited plantaris hypertrophy by approximately 50% (P < 0.05) following 14 d of OL, as did L-NAME treatment (P < 0.05). COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA did not differ between any groups at 5 d. At 14 d, however, L-NAME caused a 30-fold increase in plantaris COX-1 mRNA expression independent of loading condition. Additionally, OL induced a 20-fold increase in COX-2 mRNA expression compared with NL (P < 0.05) at 14 d, without affecting COX-1 mRNA level. L-NAME treatment significantly inhibited OL-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA.
COX activity is important for in vivo muscle hypertrophy, and plantaris overload is associated with NOS activity-dependent COX-2 expression.
We described a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who developed all-trans retinoic acid syndrome (ATRAS). ATRAS presents in patients with APL treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). It has an incidence from 5-27% with mortality of 29%. ATRAS clinical manifestations are fever, hypotension, respiratory, renal and hepatic insufficiency, lung infiltrates, pleural and pericardic effusion, and generalized edema. It is secondary to ATRA effect on promyelocyte differentiation, which causes systemic inflammatory response syndrome, endothelium damage with increase in capillary permeability, microcirculation obstruction, and tissue infiltration. Treatment is based on ATRA suspension, steroids and support measures.
A 38-year-old woman with long-standing Wegener's granulomatosis had remission with cyclophosphamide therapy after failure of response to other agents. Severe cystitis with massive blood loss necessitated a cystectomy. The bladder contained an unsuspected neoplasm, histologically resembling leiomyosarcoma, but desmosomes seen on electron-microscopic examination suggested that this was a spindle cell carcinoma. The findings document occurrence of cyclophosphamide related bladder cancer in a patient without a previously diagnosed neoplasm and indicate a need for cytologic monitoring of the bladder in patients requiring therapy with this drug.
Recent studies have reported a significant increase of proteinuria in kidney transplant recipients who were switched from a calcineurin inhibitor (CI) to sirolimus. This has (partly) been ascribed to the hemodynamic renal effects of CI withdrawal. We have evaluated the evolution of proteinuria in renal transplant recipients who underwent conversion from azathioprine to sirolimus. In a randomized, prospective, multicenter study called RESCUE (Recurrent cutanEous Squamous cell Carcinoma Under RapamunE) the efficacy and safety is investigated of conversion to sirolimus in stable renal transplant recipients with a cutaneus squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In our center 25 patients have been included in this study of which 13 patients were randomized to continue their current immunosuppressive treatment and 12 to conversion to sirolimus. After a mean follow-up of 360 days mean proteinuria increased from 0.37+/-0.34 to 1.81+/-1.73 g/24 h after conversion to sirolimus (P<0.005). In the control group there was no change in proteinuria. A significant increase of proteinuria was observed in all seven patients with proteinuria before conversion, whereas proteinuria remained absent in all patients without previous proteinuria. Two of the patients with proteinuria were converted from cyclosporine and five were converted from azathioprine to sirolimus. Sirolimus was discontinued in five patients with proteinuria, and in all of them proteinuria declined to baseline values. Our study demonstrates that conversion from azathioprine to sirolimus after kidney transplantation may cause a reversible increase of proteinuria. Sirolimus-induced proteinuria therefore cannot be ascribed to the hemodynamic renal effects of withdrawal of CI.
Fifteen mongrel dogs weighing 22-34 kg were instrumented to investigate the antiarrhythmic effects of ammonia (0.1-0.2 mmol/min ammonium hydroxide), adenosine (1.87 mumol/min), and saline (0.9% NaCl) during norepinephrine-driven ventricular tachycardia, under conditions of controlled and natural coronary blood flow. Under natural flow conditions, the severe ectopy caused by norepinephrine (100-800 ng.kg-1.min-1) was reduced by 42 +/- 4% after 30 s of ammonia infusion. Adenosine infusion reduced percent ectopy by 97 +/- 2% at 30 s. Ammonia also significantly increased coronary blood flow by 26 +/- 4%, while adenosine increased blood flow by 72 +/- 14%. Saline infusion had no significant effect on either the severity of ventricular tachycardia or coronary blood flow. Norepinephrine consistently caused coronary functional hyperemia as previously reported. When coronary blood flow was controlled by a peristaltic pump to match natural coronary blood flow and to prevent norepinephrine-induced coronary functional hyperemia, the antiarrhythmic effects of ammonia were lost while those of adenosine were unaffected. Additionally, increasing coronary blood flow manually during norepinephrine-induced ventricular tachycardia, to a level seen with combined norepinephrine and ammonia under natural flow conditions, appeared to worsen the ventricular arrhythmias. We conclude that the antiarrhythmic properties of ammonia against norepinephrine-driven ventricular tachycardia might be dependent on coronary blood flow, while those of adenosine are independent of coronary blood flow.
To investigate the role of the Fas/Fas ligand (Fas/FasL) system in testicular toxicity induced by epirubicin (Epi) and to correlate the system with the serum levels of soluble Fas and Fas ligand (sFas/sFasL), epirubicin was intraperitoneally administered to male Sprague-Dawley male rats at doses of 1.2mg/kg once a week for 10 weeks, and genital organ weights and histopathology were examined. Fas and FasL expression in rat testis were examined by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay. Expression levels of Fas and FasL were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Serum sFas/sFasL levels were determined by ELISA. The results show that the testicular toxicity of Epi involved germ cell apoptosis. Fas and FasL protein expression levels were markedly increased in Epi-treated rat testes, as was expression of sFasL. In particular, increasing serum sFasL levels were positively correlated with elevated expression levels of FasL and sFasL in the testes of Epi-treated rats, revealing serum sFasL to be a promising marker of testicular toxicity after cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, cases of severe hypotension, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported. To assess the safety of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril a multicenter, open, randomized, prazosin-controlled trial was designed comparing the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment. Trial medication was 2.5 mg enalapril or 0.5 mg prazosin. Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association functional class (I)/II and III who were not adequately compensated with digitalis and/or diuretics. In the group receiving enalapril, 3 patients (0.5%) experienced severe hypotension on day 1 and 28 patients (4.7%) moderate hypotension. In those given prazosin, 15 patients (2.6%) experienced severe hypotension and 60 patients (10.3%) moderate hypotension. The difference is statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.000012). All patients recovered. It was concluded that treatment of patients suffering from congestive heart failure New York Heart Association functional class (I)/II or III with enalapril is comparably well tolerated.
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the effect of 75 mg of a slow-release formulation of amitriptyline on the clinical severity of chronic tension-type headache and on headache-associated neurophysiological parameters (EMG activity, exteroceptive suppression of temporal muscle activity, contingent negative variation (CNV) and experimental pain sensitivity) was investigated. All of the patients treated had a history of headaches of many years' standing and many of them had failed attempts at treatment. In the amitriptyline group, a significant reduction in daily headache duration was already found in the 3rd week of treatment, while in the placebo group no significant changes in headache duration were to be seen. In week 6 the amitriptyline group had a significantly shorter daily duration of headache than did the placebo group. Treatment did not result in any significant effects on EMG recordings of pericranial muscle activity either during relaxation or contraction, on exteroceptive suppression of the temporal muscle and on CNV. The sensitivity to suprathreshold experimental pain, however, was significantly reduced. The data show a statistically relevant reduction of daily headache duration. However, they also show that amitriptyline can only partly alleviate chronic headaches but cannot cure them.
The objectives of the study were: (1) comparison of hypoalgesic effects of pre- and post-traumatic epidural morphine (EM) on primary and secondary hyperalgesia, and (2) comparison of EM hypoalgesia in normal and injured skin. Burn injuries (25 x 50 mm rectangular thermode, 47 degrees C, 7 min) were produced on the calves of healthy volunteers, at 2 different days at least 1 week apart. In randomized order, the subjects received 4 mg of EM administered via the L2-L3 intervertebral space on one day and no treatment on the other day. One calf was injured 30 min prior to and the other calf 2.5 h after administration of morphine. Hence, the calf injured prior to morphine administration was a model of postinjury treatment, and the calf injured after morphine administration, a model of pretraumatic treatment. The timing of injuries was identical on the morphine treatment and control days. The injuries induced decrease in heat pain detection and tolerance thresholds within the area of injury (area of primary hyperalgesia) as well as reduction of areas of allodynia for brush and pinprick surrounding the injury (area of secondary hyperalgesia). Both pre- and post-traumatic administration of EM increased heat pain detection and tolerance thresholds, and decreased by approximately 50% the areas of secondary hyperalgesia 2.5 h postinjury. The effects of morphine were naloxone (NAL)-reversible (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.). There was no significant difference between pre- and post-traumatic administration of morphine on the effect of either primary or secondary hyperalgesia. EM increased the heat pain detection threshold more within the injury than at a corresponding non-injured site. There was no significant difference in the effect of morphine on heat pain tolerance in injured and non-injured skin. Following NAL, the areas of secondary hyperalgesia expanded beyond control size. It is suggested that the major effect of EM on secondary hyperalgesia is inhibition of C fibre-mediated activity which maintains the altered response properties of central neurons responsible for secondary hyperalgesia. Possible mechanisms of action of NAL in enhancement of hyperalgesia are discussed.
A series of hydroxamic acid-based histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors were designed on the basis of a model of the HDAC2 binding site and synthesized. They are characterized by a cinnamic spacer, capped with a substituted phenyl group. Modifications of the spacer are also reported. In an in vitro assay with the isoenzyme HDAC2, a good correlation of the activity with the docking energy was found. In human ovarian carcinoma IGROV-1 cells, selected compounds produced significant acetylation of p53 and alpha-tubulin. Most compounds showed an antiproliferative activity comparable to that of SAHA. At equitoxic concentrations, the tested compounds were more effective than SAHA in inducing apoptotic cell death. Compounds selected for in vivo evaluation exhibited a significant antitumor activity on three tumor models at well tolerated doses, thus suggesting a good therapeutic index.
We described a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who developed all-trans retinoic acid syndrome (ATRAS) and reviewed the literature. ATRAS presents in patients with APL treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). It has an incidence from 5%-27% with mortality of 29%. It is secondary to ATRA effect on promyelocyte differentiation, which causes systemic inflammatory response syndrome, endothelium damage with increase in capillary permeability, microcirculation obstruction, and tissue infiltration. ATRAS clinical manifestations are fever, hypotension, respiratory, renal and hepatic insufficiency, lung infiltrates, pleural and pericardic effusion, and generalized edema. Treatment is based on ATRA suspension, support measures, and steroids.
Hyperalgesia and allodynia in 4 cancer patients treated with morphine disappeared after discontinuing or substituting morphine with other opioid agonists. The first case describes a young female who developed hyperalgesia and myoclonus during intravenous morphine infusion. The hyperalgesia and myoclonus disappeared when the morphine administration was discontinued and she felt comfortable on small and sporadic oral doses of methadone. The second case describes hyperalgesia occurring after a small dose of sustained-release morphine which disappeared after alternative use of oral ketobemidone. The third case describes hyperalgesia following high doses of intramuscular morphine which disappeared after alternative use of continuous subcutaneous infusion of sufentanil. The fourth case describes a boy developing hyperalgesia after high doses of oral and intramuscular morphine. The hyperalgesia disappeared after discontinuing morphine administration but withdrawal symptoms developed due to too small doses of methadone. Possible mechanisms of morphine-induced hyperalgesia are discussed.
Approximately 30% of women afflicted with migraine have menstrually associated attacks. These migraines are often refractory to treatment. Evidence suggests estrogen and progestin fluctuations may influence menstrual migraine. Phytoestrogens have demonstrated estrogenic effects in some tissues, but are without stimulation of the endometrium, suggesting decreased risk with long-term use. This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of a phytoestrogen combination in the prophylactic treatment of menstrual migraine. Forty-nine patients were randomized to receive either placebo, or a daily combination of 60 mg soy isoflavones, 100 mg dong quai, and 50 mg black cohosh, with each component standardized to its primary alkaloid. Patients received study medication for 24 weeks. Average frequency of menstrually associated migraine attacks during weeks 9-24 was reduced from 10.3 +/- 2.4 (mean +/- s.e.m.) in placebo treated patients to 4.7 +/- 1.8 (P < 0.01) in patients treated with the phytoestrogen preparation.
Blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trials have established that cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) receptor antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitors are safe and effective asthma treatments. Trials of 13- to 26-wks' duration demonstrate that both the cysLT1 receptor antagonist, zafirlukast, and the 5-LO inhibitor, zileuton, improve pulmonary function and decrease daytime and nocturnal symptoms. Concomitant rescue beta-agonist inhaler use and the need for corticosteroid rescue are also reduced. Preliminary studies suggest that antileukotriene agents may also reduce indices of airway inflammation, including inflammatory cell counts and airway hyperresponsiveness. Both cysLT1 antagonists and 5-LO inhibitors offer a new approach to asthma management. Drazen J. Clinical pharmacology of leukotriene receptor antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors.
Insight into the role of the different cyclooxygenase isoforms in prostaglandin biosynthesis, surface hydrophobicity, and gastric mucosal barrier integrity can be gained by comparing the effects of luminal damaging agents in wild-type and cyclooxygenase knockout mice.
Fasted wild-type, cyclooxygenase-1, and cyclooxygenase-2 knockout mice were intragastrically administered saline, 0.6N HCl, or aspirin (aspirin 20 mmol/L) in combination with 0.6N HCl and killed 1 hour later, at which time the gastric lesion score was assessed and biopsy samples were taken for surface, biochemical, and morphological analyses.
The gastric mucosa of cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mice was more severely injured by both HCl alone and aspirin/HCl than that of wild-type and cyclooxygenase-2 knockout mice. HCl alone and aspirin/HCl also induced a more profound decrease in surface hydrophobicity in cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mice than in wild-type mice, whereas this surface property was unaffected in cyclooxygenase-2 knockout mice. The gastric injury induced by aspirin/HCl in cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mice could be prevented if the animals were treated with phosphatidylcholine-associated aspirin. Aspirin/HCl, in comparison to saline or HCl alone, induced a 4-6-fold increase in gastric mucosal prostaglandin E(2) concentration in the cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mice, whereas it decreased prostaglandin E(2) levels in wild-type and cyclooxygenase-2 knockout mice. This paradoxical aspirin-induced increase in gastric prostaglandin E(2) in cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mice seemed to correspond to an increase in cyclooxygenase-2 messenger RNA and protein expression. The gastric lesion score seemed to be significantly associated with alterations in surface hydrophobicity but not with mucosal prostaglandin E(2) concentration.
Our evidence on cyclooxygenase knockout mice suggests that aspirin predominantly causes gastric injury by a non-prostaglandin mechanism, perhaps by attenuating surface hydrophobicity, a possibility supported by the low gastric toxicity of phosphatidylcholine/aspirin. However, prostaglandins generated by cyclooxygenase-1 may play an important permissive role in maintaining gastric mucosal barrier integrity. Aspirin seems to paradoxically increase the gastric mucosal prostaglandin E(2) concentration in cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mice, possibly by the induction of cyclooxygenase-2.
Pain is a recognized feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) but has never been studied in multiple system atrophy (MSA), the commonest cause of atypical parkinsonism. We retrospectively analysed histories of pain in 100 consecutive cases of clinically probable MSA. Details were obtained from the medical records of 100 patients with MSA, comprising 82 with the striatonigral degeneration (SND) type and 18 with the olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) type of MSA. Pain was reported in 47% of the MSA patients. It was classified as rheumatic in 64% of MSA patients reporting pain, sensory in 28%, dystonic in 21%, and levodopa-related in 16%, mostly related to off-period or diphasic dystonias. There was a mixed pain syndrome in 19% of these patients. Pain was significantly more commonly reported by females (P = 0.02), and by patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesias (P = 0.02). No other clinical feature differentiated MSA patients who reported pain from those who did not. The mean delay between disease onset and onset of pain was 2.9 years, but pain was reported at the time of, or before, disease onset in about 30% of patients. The overall prevalence of pain in MSA was similar to that reported in IPD, but the distribution of pain categories was different.
We report the case of a 31-year-old woman who delivered twins by Caesarean section in whom atonic uterine haemorrhage developed 6 h postoperatively. During conservative treatment with the high-dose prostaglandin analogs sulprostone (PGE(2)) and dinoprost (PGF(2alpha)), acute pulmonary oedema and cardiac decompensation developed and, subsequently, the patient suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. After a 2h-period of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), it was possible to restore and stabilize circulation under the highest dose of catecholamines. Despite 2h of CPR, the patient was discharged from hospital 3 months later without any major physical or neurocognitive deficit.
Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.
To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m-Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia.
The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine stress test. Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level. In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT. The increase in dP/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group. dP/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone.
The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%.
If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost-savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.
Diabetes is associated with increased risk of mortality as a consequence of acute myocardial infarction. This study determined whether rosiglitazone (ROSI) could reduce myocardial infarction after ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Male Lewis rats were anesthetized, and the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated for 30 minutes. After reperfusion for 24 hours, the ischemic and infarct sizes were determined. ROSI at 1 and 3 mg/kg IV reduced infarct size by 30% and 37%, respectively (P<0.01 versus vehicle). Pretreatment with ROSI (3 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) PO) for 7 days also reduced infarct size by 24% (P<0.01). ROSI also improved ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction. Left ventricular systolic pressure and positive and negative maximal values of the first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) were significantly improved in ROSI-treated rats. ROSI reduced the accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in the ischemic heart by 40% and 43%, respectively (P<0.01). Ischemia/reperfusion induced upregulation of CD11b/CD18 and downregulation of L-selectin on neutrophils and monocytes; these effects were significantly attenuated in ROSI-treated animals. Likewise, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression in ischemic hearts was markedly diminished by ROSI, as was the ischemia/reperfusion-stimulated upregulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.
ROSI reduced myocardial infarction and improved contractile dysfunction caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury. The cardioprotective effect of ROSI was most likely due to inhibition of the inflammatory response.
