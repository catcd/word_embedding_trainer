Sequential treatment of rats with low doses of lithium and pilocarpine, a high dose of pilocarpine, or continuous hippocampal stimulation [CHS] (9 epochs, 10 min each) is reported to result in status epilepticus (SE). We report a novel method to establish SE based on continuous ventral hippocampal stimulation (5 epochs) followed by low dose pilocarpine (40 mg/kg) challenge. Motor limbic seizures occured in all the control rats. The latency to spike activity was 15 +/- 1 min after pilocarpine administration. Ventral hippocampal [VHc] and cortical EEG recordings were used to monitor the protective effect of diazepam (5 mg/kg). Except phenobarbital, all the three drugs completely prevented all the phases of seizure activity. Initiation of spikes was significantly prolonged by phenobarbital pretreatment. Further study on the characteristics of these convulsions offers a unique possibility for the recognition of brain regions, pathways, and neurotransmitters engaged in the spread of seizures in this model.
To investigate the effect of Shourong compound formula on treating Parkinson's disease.
Parkinson's disease model mice induced by reserpine was used and by HPLC-ED the levels of Dopamine (DA) and its metabolites were determined.
Madopar could increase the levels of DA in brain of PD mice. The effect of madopar together with Sourong compound formula was better than that of madopar(P < 0.001).
Shourong compound formula together with madopar has synergic effect on increase of DA level in brain and can reduce clinic dose of madopar so that side effect of madopar can be decreased.
Urolithins were the metabolites of ellagic acid by intestinal flora in gastrointestinal tract. In previous research, it was found that urolithins could mainly inhibit prostate cancer and colon cancer cell growth. However, there is no report about bladder cancer therapy of urolithins. In this paper, three urolithin-type compounds (urolithin A, urolithin B, 8-OMe-urolithin A) and ellagic acid were evaluated for antiproliferative activity in vitro against human bladder cancer cell lines T24. The IC₅₀ values for T24 cell inhibition were 43.9, 35.2, 46.3 and 33.7 μM for urolithin A, urolithin B, 8-OMe-urolithin A and ellagic acid, respectively. After the administration of urolithins and ellagic acid, we found these compounds could increase mRNA and protein expression of Phospho-p38 MAPK, and decrease mRNA and protein expression of MEKK1 and Phospho-c-Jun in T24 cells. Caspase-3 was also activated and PPAR-γ protein expression increased in drug-induced apoptosis. And what's more, the antioxidant assay afforded by three urolithins and EA treatments were associated with decreases in the intracellular ROS and MDA levels, and increased SOD activity in H₂O₂-treated T24 cells. The results suggested that these compounds could inhibit cell proliferation by p38-MAPK and/or c-Jun medicated caspase-3 activation and reduce the oxidative stress status in bladder cancer.
Post-transplant prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is based on treatment with lamivudine and/or hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). However, optimum doses and duration for these drugs are not yet clear. We tested high doses of lamivudine (300 mg/day) in combination with low doses of HBIG (200-400 IU/2-4 weeks). Eighty patients who had post-transplant prophylaxis of lamivudine and HBIG were included in the study. Of those, 20 had hepatitis D virus co-infection and eight were HBV DNA-positive at the time of transplantation. Ten HBV DNA-positive patients were treated with lamivudine (150 mg/day) before transplantation; all were HBV DNA-negative after lamivudine treatment. All patients in the anhepatic phase were given 4000 IU of HBIG. Following this, 400 or 800 IU HBIG was administered intramuscularly daily for 5-10 days post-transplantation and 2-4 times weekly thereafter, according to serum titre of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Lamivudine was maintained or initiated at the time of transplantation and was continued indefinitely. Median follow-up was 21 months (range 3-73 months). Recurrence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positivity occurred in only three out of 78 (4%) patients; two of these three were HBV DNA-positive. Median anti-HBs titre at the final follow-up was 68 IU. Patient and graft survival was 85% at 1 year. In conclusion, a combination of lamivudine 300 mg/day and low-dose HBIG prevents post-transplantation recurrence of hepatitis B, even in the presence of viral replication in the pre-transplant period.
Community-based studies are conducted to determine the degree to which therapeutic interventions will succeed in real world settings. This large practice-based clinical trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose combination therapy with amlodipine/benazepril, compared with amlodipine monotherapy, in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
Hypertensive patients currently taking amlodipine were selected based on one of two criteria: inadequate blood pressure (BP) control on amlodipine (diastolic BP [DBP] > or = 90 mm Hg; group 1), or inability to tolerate amlodipine (DBP < or = 90 mm Hg, but with edema; group 2). Eligible patients were switched from 5 or 10 mg of amlodipine to 5/10 mg or 5/20 mg of amlodipine/benazepril for 4 weeks. In group 1 (n = 6410), primary efficacy outcome was change in mean sitting DBP. A secondary efficacy outcome was change in mean sitting systolic BP (SBP). In group 2 (n = 1502), primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of patients whose edema improved during therapy with amlodipine/benazepril when compared with amlodipine monotherapy.
In group 1, mean sitting DBP declined from 96.5 mm Hg at baseline to 84.9 mm Hg at week 4, a mean reduction of 11.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI] -11.8 to -11.3 mm Hg; P < .001). From baseline to week 4, mean sitting SBP declined from 152.9 mm Hg to 137.3 mm Hg, a mean reduction of 15.6 mm Hg (95% CI -16.0 to -15.2 mm Hg; P < .001). In group 2, 85% (95% CI 83%-87%) experienced some improvement in edema compared with baseline levels.
Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive agent amlodipine/benazepril was safe and effective for patients who experienced either inadequate BP control or edema with amlodipine monotherapy.
Subcutaneous administration of caerulein (100-500 micrograms/kg) significantly reduced the development of picrotoxin (8 mg/kg) seizures in male mice. The same doses of caerulein inhibited 3H-flunitrazepam binding in in vivo experiments. Proglumide, an antagonist of cholecystokinin receptors, in low dose (5 mg/kg) potentiated the effects of caerulein (100 micrograms/kg), whereas the administration of proglumide in high dose (25 mg/kg) reduced the action of caerulein on 3H-flunitrazepam binding and picrotoxin seizures. Caerulein (5-1000 nM) decreased 3H-flunitrazepam binding in in vitro experiments only after supplementation of the binding medium with 120 mM NaCl and 5mM KCl. The results suggest the possible interaction of caerulein with chloride ionophor. It seems probable that the direct interaction of caerulein with chloride ionophor in involved in the inhibitory effect of caerulein on picrotoxin seizures and 3H-flunitrazepam binding.
The objective of this study was to investigate the site of action of dipyrone in rat paw prostaglandin-induced hyperalgesia. The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of dipyrone had no effect on the hyperalgesic response to prostaglandins. In contrast, intraplantar (i.pl.) and intrathecal (i.t.) injections produced dose-dependent analgesic effects. The analgesia observed following the intraperitoneal (i.p.), i.t., i.pl. or combined i.t. and i.pl. administration of dipyrone was abolished by pretreating the paws with L-NMMA (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) or methylene blue (MB, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase). These results support the suggestion that dipyrone-mediated antinociception results from a combined spinal and peripheral effect in the primary peripheral sensory neuron via stimulation of the arginine/cGMP pathway.
To report a case of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) following the use of albuterol (salbutamol) in a patient without preexisting coronary artery disease and to review the related literature.
An 84-year-old white woman with no history of cardiac disease was treated for an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with albuterol 5 mg and ipratropium bromide 500 microg nebulized with oxygen; the albuterol was given in the same dose every 2 hours. Her respiratory condition improved, but soon after the sixth dose of albuterol, she developed increasing chest tightness. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment elevation in the chest leads (V(2,3)) and, subsequently, the troponin I concentration and creatine kinase rose. Urgent coronary angiography showed smooth coronary arteries with no obstructive coronary artery disease or thrombosis. Left ventriculography showed anterior hypokinesia consistent with anterior myocardial injury. A subsequent echocardiogram also revealed normal left ventricular size but anterior, anteroseptal, and apical hypokinesia. An objective causality assessment revealed that albuterol had a probable likelihood of causing the AMI in this patient.
A MEDLINE search (1966-February 2004) revealed 6 other case reports of AMI associated with albuterol treatment. The possible pathogenesis of albuterol-induced myocardial necrosis includes activation of cardiac and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors, inducing positive chronotropic and inotropic effects and vasodilation with coronary blood flow redistribution. Albuterol can also cause hypokalemia and other metabolic and electrical changes, including prolonged QT interval. These effects may be especially detrimental in patients with hypoxia, hypercapnea, and preexisting heart diseases.
Although myocardial injury is a rare complication following albuterol therapy, clinicians should use high-dose beta(2)-agonists with caution. Close monitoring of ECG and metabolic changes is recommended before early repeated high doses are administered.
We report the case of a patient who developed acute hepatitis with extensive hepatocellular necrosis, 7 months after the onset of administration of clotiazepam, a thienodiazepine derivative. Clotiazepam withdrawal was followed by prompt recovery. The administration of several benzodiazepines, chemically related to clotiazepam, did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of hepatitis. This observation shows that clotiazepam can induce acute hepatitis and suggests that there is no cross hepatotoxicity between clotiazepam and several benzodiazepines.
To present a single case of sulbactam/ampicillin-induced chronic cholestasis and a literature review of antibiotic-associated chronic cholestasis.
A 74-year-old man with Hodgkin's disease in remission developed severe and prolonged cholestasis after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin 750 mg twice daily for 7 days. All other etiologies, including Hodgkin's disease, were appropriately ruled out and the cholestasis was ascribed to sulbactam/ampicillin treatment. The patient improved gradually and became asymptomatic 7 months after the last dose of sulbactam/ampicillin. According to the Naranjo probability scale, sulbactam/ampicillin was the probable cause of the cholestasis.
Ampicillin, a semisynthetic penicillin, has rarely been associated with hepatic injury when used alone. Hepatocellular and acute cholestatic injury due to ampicillin have been described. Cholestasis secondary to sulbactam/ampicillin use has not been previously reported.
Sulbactam/ampicillin, one of the most widely used antibiotics, may cause chronic cholestatic hepatitis. Clinicians should be aware of this adverse affect and consider it during diagnostic workup of liver injury.
The pharmacokinetics of dihydroquinidine were studied in 8 patients with congestive heart failure following a 22 min intravenous infusion of a quinidine preparation that contained 5.9% dihydroquinidine as an impurity. Using a thin layer chromatography-fluorometric assay procedure for dihydroquinidine, the post-infusion plasma dihydroquinidine concentrations declined biexponentially. The half-life of the fast and slow dispositional processes was 4.42 +/- 1.81 min and 6.52 +/- 2.40 h, respectively. The central compartment volume for dihydroquinidine in these patients was 0.44 +/- 0.11 l/kg with an overall apparent volume of distribution of 1.14 +/- 0.38 l/kg. The computed values of total body plasma clearance of dihydroquinidine ranged from 1.29 to 2.69 ml/min/kg with a mean value of 1.94 +/- 0.60 ml/min/kg. In these patients, approximately 16% of the administered dihydroquinidine dose was excreted intact into the urine in 48 h. The estimated value of renal clearance was 0.314 +/- 0.129 ml/min/kg. When compared to control cardiac patients, the data showed that the apparent volume of distribution for dihydroquinidine is smaller in patients with congestive heart failure and as a result of this diminished volume, the clearance rate of dihydroquinidine was slower. The net effect of these differences was the production of higher plasma concentrations of dihydroquinidine in the heart failure group.
To determine the safety and efficacy of a cream formulation of 0.05% isotretinoin with sunscreens (SPF 15) (I+S) in the treatment of photoaged skin.
A 6-month, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study of 346 subjects with photoaged skin, as defined by the presence of fine lines in the periorbital region. The main outcome measure was profilometry measurements of replicas of the periorbital region, taken at 0 and 6 months. Subsidiary outcome measures were clinical scoring of wrinkles/fine lines at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months and histopathology at 0 and 6 months.
A total of 172 subjects were randomized to 0.05% I+S and 174 subjects to vehicle. Subjects used the study medication topically, once-daily for 6 months, followed by a 3-month washout period. Profilometry measurements of the distance between the highest peak and lowest valley (Rz) and the distance between all valleys and peaks from mid-line (Ra) showed that subjects using I+S had statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, at all visits, VAS clinical scoring of wrinkles/fine lines showed a statistically significant difference between the groups in favour of I+S. Tolerance assessments showed that more subjects in the I+S group experienced local side effects at the start of the study; however, reports of side effects decreased over time in both groups.
This study confirms that I+S improves the appearance of fine wrinkles associated with photoaged skin.
This study was undertaken to investigate the protective effects of melatonin against formaldehyde-induced renal damage in rats. For this purpose, 21 male Wistar rats were divided into three groups. The animals in Group I were used as a control, whereas the rats in group II were injected every other day with formaldehyde. The rats in group III received melatonin daily while exposed to formaldehyde. At the end of the 14-day experimental period, all rats were killed by decapitation, and the kidneys were removed. Some of the renal tissue specimens were used for determination of superoxide dismutase, glutatione peroxidase enzyme activities, and malondialdehyde levels. The remaining kidney tissue specimens were used for light microscopic evaluation. The renal tissue activities of superoxide dismutase and glutatione peroxidase were significantly decreased, and malondialdehyde levels were significantly increased in rats treated with formaldehyde compared with those of the control animals. In the light microscopic evaluation of this group, degenerative glomerules, vacuolization and dilatation of distal tubules, and vascular congestion were detected. However, an increase was observed in activities of superoxide dismutase and glutatione peroxidase enzymes, and a decrease of malondialdehyde levels in animals treated with formaldehyde plus melatonin was observed. Furthermore, the histopathological changes caused by formaldehyde were disappeared except for minimal tubular dilatation in this group. In conclusion, the biochemical and histological findings of our study suggest that melatonin administration prevents formaldehyde-induced oxidative renal damage in rats.
In mice, tonic convulsive seizure induced by intravenous administration of caffeine (adenosine A1, A2 receptors antagonist) was significantly potentiated by any one of L-PIA (adenosine A1 receptor agonist), NECA (adenosine A2 receptor agonist) and 2-ClAd (adenosine A1, A2 receptors agonist). The caffeine-induced seizure was unaffected by diazepam (benzodiazepine receptor agonist), but was inhibited by Ro 15-1788 (antagonist or partial agonist). beta-DMCM (antagonist or inverse agonist) increased the seizure. Muscimol (GABA-a receptor agonist), baclofen (GABA-b receptor agonist) and AOAA (GABA transaminase inhibitor) did not show significant effect on caffeine-induced convulsion. Bicuculline (GABA-a receptor antagonist) and picrotoxin (chloride channel blocker) significantly potentiated the convulsion at the doses which did not induce it. Caffeine-induced convulsion was potentiated by NMDA with its non-convulsive dose. CPP (competitive NMDA receptor antagonist) and MK-801 (non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist) significantly inhibited the seizures. These results suggest that caffeine-induced seizure is not caused by blockade of adenosine receptors. Caffeine may act to beta-carboline sensitive benzodiazepine receptor (Type 1) which has no linkage with GABA-a receptor. Furthermore, it is implied that caffeine plays some role at NMDA receptor calcium ion channel complex.
Denervation in man often results in shiny, dry, thin skin. A previous study has shown that the epidermis of glabrous skin in the rat becomes approximately 40% thinner within 1 week following sciatic nerve transection, but which nerve fiber type or types influence epidermal thickness is unknown. In this study, we compared the effects on the epidermis of selective sensory, motor, and sympathetic denervation. Protein gene product 9.5 and calcitonin gene-related peptide immunocytochemical staining were used to determine the extent of denervation of epidermis, dermis, and sweat glands in the footpads. Epidermal thickness of the glabrous plantar skin of the foot was measured. To verify the specificity and reliability of each animal model, the relevant regions of the peripheral nervous system were examined by light or electron microscopy or both. Epidermal thickness decreased significantly following sciatic nerve transection (58% of control, P < 0.05) and dorsal root ganglionectomy (59%; P < 0.05). The thickness also decreased following lumbar ventral rhizotomy (61%; P < 0.01), destruction of lumbar spinal motor neurons (66%; P < 0.05), and botulinum toxin-induced paralysis of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles (70%; P < 0.05). A slight decrease followed dorsal rhizotomy (84%; P < 0.01). In contrast, no significant alterations in epidermal thickness were detected following sham operation and sympathectomy. Epidermal thinning was paralleled by reductions in the amounts of transcripts for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and beta-actin. These results suggest that selective loss of both sensory and motor fibers to the hind limb can contribute to reducing epidermal thickness in rat foot glabrous skin.
The authors report on 22 observations made from june 1982 to december 1984 in African children having presented an intolerance against metoclopramide. After recalling briefly the pharmacology of this drug, they describe the symptomatology similar to neuroleptic intoxication syndrome: parkinsonian syndrome, motor excitation syndrome. Posology was correct in 2/3 of the cases, when it was known. Overdose was observed in 5 cases only. Recovery was complete after the administration of the drug was stopped, but it was accelerated by antiparkinsonian drugs.
Urinary pregnanetriol and delta 5-pregnenetriol were determined in 90 normal women and in 90 women with idiopathic hirsutism of comparable age group. When group Student's "t"-test was carried out, the mean steroid excretion values in hirsute women were found to be significant with delta 5-pregnenetriol more significant than pregnanetriol. Of the 90 women with hirsutism, 8 patients had pregnanetriol and delta 5-pregnenetriol values higher than normal. When, on the basis of these elevated values, the women were sent for a thorough gynaecological investigation, they were found to have the polycystic ovary syndrome. After wedge resection, the diagnosis was confirmed and the urinary excretion of pregnanetriol and delta 5-pregnenetriol came down to a normal level. This study shows that, in the case of women with idiopathic hirsutism suspected of any ovarian disorder, the measurement of these two steroids could be of diagnostic importance.
Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) usually presents in chronic alcoholics and in patients in whom hyponatraemia has been corrected rapidly. However, CPM may occur in other clinical circumstances, including patients with severe hypoglycaemia. We describe the occurrence of CPM and quadriplegia in a patient who experienced fluoroquinolone-associated severe hypoglycaemia.
A 63-year-old man with Type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted to hospital for resection of a large liposarcoma. Renal-dose levofloxacin was utilized as part of an antimicrobial regimen to treat post-operative peritonitis. On days 6-8 of levofloxacin therapy, the patient experienced recurrent hypoglycaemia despite total parenteral nutrition, 10% dextrose containing fluids and cessation of insulin therapy 3 days prior to the first hypoglycaemic episode. Hypoglycaemia resolved within 24 h of stopping levofloxacin. After a final and severe hypoglycaemic event, the patient developed quadriplegia and tonic left deviation of gaze. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a high-intensity lesion in the central pons consistent with CPM.
Fluoroquinolones should be considered as a potential cause of hypoglycaemia. Severe hypoglycaemia has the potential to cause white matter lesions in the pons. Putative mechanisms include failure of membrane ion channels, oligodendrocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress of glucose reperfusion. Fluoroquinolone-associated hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia-induced quadriplegia are both rare and we believe this is the first case report linking the two events.
Methamphetamine (MA) is an illicit psychostimulant, and its abuse has become an international public health problem. MA intoxication can cause life-threatening hyperthermia, renal and liver failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological damage. To investigate the relationship between the underlying mechanism of such intoxication and metabolic networks, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics experiments were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats treated with MA at 10mgkg(-1)h(-1) for 4h. Using a combination of gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry, global and targeted analyses were performed on biological samples collected during 0-24 and 72-96h (for urine), and at 24 and 96h (for plasma) after the last drug administration. Body temperature and plasma biochemical parameters were also measured to detect abnormal reactions in neuronal and other several tissues. 5-Oxoproline, saccharic acid, uracil, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), adipic acid, glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, such as fumarate, were proposed as potential biomarkers related to MA-induced intoxications. In particular, the observation of decreased TCA cycle intermediates and 3-HB and increased glucose suggested that high doses of MA inhibit biogenic energy production by glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation via the TCA cycle, and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. These results may provide not only a clue to clarify the underlying mechanism of diverse intoxication effects, but also biological fluid-based diagnostic and forensic methods with which to objectively demonstrate intoxication without directly determining the drug.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is currently being used as an anticancer drug to reduce tumor bulk in order to increase the operability rate and postoperative survival in patients with cervical cancer, which has been combined with cisplatin (CP) because of its superior activities observed in human carcinoma cells. However, the combined anticancer effect of 5-FU and CP in cervical carcinoma cells is poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate whether anticancer drugs 5-FU and CP may exhibit the combined antiproliferative effect in cervical carcinoma cells. Using proteomics analysis, including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), we investigated the antiproliferative effect-related proteins after treatment with 5-FU and/or CP. Our experiments showed that the combination of 5-FU and CP engaged both the apoptotic pathways: the membrane death receptor-mediated apoptosis pathway and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Moreover, the combination of 5-FU and CP resulted in remarkable increasing susceptibility to apoptosis. We suggest that the combination of 5-FU and CP suppresses the growth of cervical carcinoma cells by synergistic effect with the induction of apoptosis. In vitro synergistic effect of 5-FU and CP supports the basis of the clinical application of the combination chemotherapy to the patients with cervical cancer.
Although previous studies have confirmed the safety of dobutamine stress echocardiography, complex ventricular arrhythmias have been reported. Our aim was (1) to identify the markers of increased arrhythmic risk during dobutamine stress echocardiography and (2) to assess whether the occurrence of major ventricular arrhythmias during the test may represent a clinically useful marker of electrical instability. Three hundred and seventy-seven consecutive survivors from acute myocardial infarction, off cardioactive therapy, underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography 11.4 days after the acute event. Holter monitoring with assessment of heart rate variability and echocardiographic determination of left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, exercise stress testing, signal averaged ECG and coronary angiography were carried out, respectively, in 357, 150 and 273 patients. Ten subjects showed complex ventricular arrhythmias (eight non-sustained and one sustained ventricular tachycardia and one ventricular fibrillation) during dobutamine stress echocardiography (group A), whilst 366 did not (group B). Complex ventricular arrhythmias were detected by Holter monitoring in 8/10 patients in group A and 45/367 patients in group B (odds ratio 28.6, 95% CI 5.4-92.2) and by exercise testing in 4/10 patients in group A and 33/347 patients in group B (odds ratio 6.3, 95% CI 1.4-27.2). Ejection fraction < 40% was present in 3/10 patients in group A and 50/367 in group B (odds ratio 2.7, 95% CI 0.3-12.2), whilst multivessel disease was present, respectively, in 8/10 and 176/263 patients (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 0.3-25.5). Reduced heart rate variability and the presence of late potentials on signal averaged ECG were found in, respectively, 40/367 and 13/140 patients in group B, but none were found in group A. A total of 61 events (35 CABG, 15 PTCA, four cardiac deaths and seven non-fatal reinfarctions) occurred during the follow-up (11.4 months, range 6 to 20): four in group A and 57 in group B. No documented major arrhythmic event was reported. We conclude that (1) complex arrhythmias during dobutamine stress may occur in patients early after acute myocardial infarction; (2) the preexisting evidence of frequent, as well as repetitive, arrhythmias represents a potential marker of increased risk in this connection and, finally, (3) dobutamine-induced arrhythmias seem to represent an uncommon, even though potentially dangerous, event but not a useful new "window' on electrical instability of post-MI patients.
The respiratory effects of pymadin, amiridine, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), its analog RGH 2202, and pentetrazol and their interaction with morphine were studied in anesthesized rats. During intravenous injection or local application to the medulla oblongata, pymadin, amiridine, TRH and RGH 2202 were shown to enhance the respiratory activity of the diaphragm and to abolish its morphine-induced inhibition. TRH and RGH 2202 proved to be the most potent and safe antagonists of morphine-induced respiratory depression. These agents given in the doses sufficient to completely abolish morphine-induced respiratory depression unchanged its antinociceptive activity. Pentetrazol in the tested dose range failed to increase diaphragmatic respiratory activity or to eliminate its depression induced by morphine.
This study evaluated the anti-obesity effects of Phellinus baumii extract (PBE) in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Male 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, normal chow diet plus vehicle; HFD-control, high-fat plus vehicle; HFD plus orlistat (Xenical(®), Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (50 mg/kg); and HFD plus PBE (500 mg/kg). PBE was administered daily by oral gavage for 12 weeks. Oral administration of PBE (500 mg/kg) significantly reduced body weight gain, hepatic lipid concentrations, and fat accumulation in epididymal adipocytes compared with mice fed HFD alone (P < .05). mRNA expression of genes related to triglyceride (TG) synthesis was suppressed in the PBE groups, and fatty acid synthase activity was also significantly inhibited (P < .05). Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of PBE on TG absorption and detected marked reduction in TG absorption in Xenical- and PBE-treated mice compared with the control group (P < .05). To determine the active compound of PBE, fractionation was conducted, and interfungin A, davallialactone, and hypholomine B were identified as the main compounds. Among the three identified compounds, as a representative compound, davallialactone was also shown to suppress fat accumulation in an in vitro model system. These anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects appear to be partly mediated by suppressing plasma and hepatic fat accumulation through the inhibition of enzymes associated with hepatic and intestinal lipid absorption and synthesis.
In addition to standard treatment with digitalis and diuretics prazosin (20 mg/d) and placebo were given to 14 patients with chronic therapy-resistant cardiac failure mainly of stage III for periods of 6 weeks each. Cardiac frequency, blood pressure, cardiac volume, pulmonary artery pressures and cardiac minute volume were assessed at rest and during physical exercise. Body weight, congestive changes in the chest radiograph, oedema and complaints were evaluated. During the acute trial using 2 mg of prazosin a significant increase of cardiac minute volume was demonstrable at rest and during exercise (2 P less than 0.05). After administration for 6 weeks cardiac minute volume increased from 3.2 to 4.0 l/min at rest and from 6.9 to 8.0 l/min during exercise (2P less than 0.005; n=12). There was a noticeable decrease of cardiac size from 1440 to 1306 ml/1.73 m2 (2 P less than 0.02). Haemodynamic improvement paralleled the decrease of complaints which was equivalent to an improvement of half to one stage of the New York Heart Association. In severe cardiac failure prazosin has thus an additional therapeutic effect beyond digitalis and diuretics.
2,2,3,3-Tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (TMCA, 4) is a cyclic analogue of the antiepileptic drug (AED) valproic acid (VPA) (1). alpha-F, alpha-Cl, alpha-Br, and alpha-methyl derivatives of 4 and their amides were synthesized and tested in rodent models for anticonvulsant potency and AED-induced teratogenicity. In the anticonvulsant rat-maximal electroshock (MES) and subcutaneous metrazol (scMet) tests, alpha-Cl-TMCD (17) had ED(50) values of 97 and 27 mg/kg, respectively. alpha-F-TMCD (11) was 120 times more potent than VPA in the rat-scMet test (ED(50) = 6 mg/kg) and had a protective index (PI = TD(50)/ED(50)) of 20. In the 6 Hz psychomotor mouse model 11 had ED(50) values of 57 mg/kg (32 mA) and 59 mg/kg (44 mA). The ED(50) values of 11 in the hippocampal-kindled rat model and in the pilocarpine-induced-status rat model were 30 and 23 mg/kg, respectively. Unlike 1, 11 was nonteratogenic in mice. This novel compound has the potential to become a candidate for development as a new potent and safe antiepileptic and CNS drug.
