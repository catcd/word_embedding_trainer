The baroreflex pathway might include a glutamatergic connection between the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and a segment of the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) called the caudal ventrolateral medulla. The main goal of this study was to seek direct evidence for such a connection. Awake rats were subjected to phenylephrine- (PE-) induced hypertension (N=5) or received saline (N=5). Neuronal activation was gauged by the presence of Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-ir) nuclei. Fos-ir neurons that contained vesicular glutamate transporter 2 mRNA (glutamatergic neurons) or glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA (GABAergic neurons) were mapped throughout the medulla oblongata. Saline-treated rats had very few Fos-ir neurons. In PE-treated rats, Fos-ir neurons were detected in both NTS and VLM. In NTS, 72% of Fos-ir neurons were glutamatergic and 26% were GABAergic. In the VLM, 41% of Fos-ir neurons were glutamatergic and 56% were GABAergic. In VLM, Fos-ir glutamatergic neurons were evenly distributed and were often catecholaminergic, whereas Fos-ir GABAergic cells were clustered around Bregma -13.0 mm. This region of the VLM was injected with Fluoro-Gold (FG) in eight rats, four of which received PE and the rest saline. Fos-ir NTS neurons retrogradely labeled with FG were detected only in PE-treated rats. These cells were exclusively glutamatergic and were concentrated within the NTS subnuclei that receive the densest inputs from arterial baroreceptors. In conclusion, PE, presumably via baroreceptor stimulation, induces Fos in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in both NTS and VLM. At least 29% of the Fos-ir glutamatergic neurons of NTS project to the vicinity of the VLM GABAergic interneurons that are presumed to mediate the sympathetic baroreflex.
The unfortunate experience with lithium chloride as a salt substitute in the 1940s still directs the clinical usuage of lithium carbonate to a certain extent. We are still warned that lithium salts should never be used in low-sodium situations (e.g., with thiazide diuretics or salt-restricted diets); however, it has recently been shown that thiazide diuretics may be safely used in the treatment of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). The authors recapitulate the dangers inherent in the use of this drug combination and present detailed clinical-pharmacologic data on 13 patients which suggest that thiazides are useful in the treatment of lithium-induced NDI and may actually synergize with lithium to produce improved mood control in some lithium-refractory manic-depressive patients.
1. The effects of nitric oxide (NO) releasing substances, sodium nitroprusside, 3-morpholino sydnonimine (SIN-1) and a novel oxatriazole derivative, GEA 3162, on blood pressure and heart rate were studied after peripheral or central administration in anaesthetized normotensive Wistar rats. 2. Given as cumulative intravenous injections, both nitroprusside and GEA 3162 (24-188 nmol kg-1) induced short-lasting and dose-dependent decreases in mean arterial pressure, while SIN-1 decreased blood pressure only slightly even after larger doses (94-3000 nmol kg-1). Heart rate increased concomitantly with the hypotensive effect of the NO-releasing substances. 3. Cumulative intracerebroventricular administration of GEA 3162 (24-188 nmol kg-1) induced a dose-dependent hypotension with slight but insignificant increases in heart rate. In contrast, intracerebroventricular nitroprusside induced little change in blood pressure, while a large dose of SIN-1 (3000 nmol kg-1, i.c.v.) slightly increased mean arterial pressure. However, intracerebroventricular nitroprusside and SIN-1 increased heart rate at doses that did not significantly affect blood pressure. 4. To determine whether the cardiovascular effects of GEA 3162 were attributable to an elevation of cyclic GMP levels, pretreatments with methylene blue, a putative guanylate cyclase inhibitor, were performed. This substance failed to attenuate the cardiovascular effects of peripherally or centrally administered GEA 3162, suggesting that the effects were independent of guanylate cyclase. 5. In conclusion, the centrally administered NO-donor, GEA 3162, induced a dose-dependent. hypotensive response without significant changes in heart rate. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injections of nitroprusside and SIN-1 increased heart rate without affecting blood pressure. These results suggest that NO released by these drugs may affect central mechanisms involved in cardiovascular regulation independently of cyclic GMP.
Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) is an important industrial intermediate used in manufacturing flexible polyurethane (PUR) foams, surface coatings, cast elastomers, sealants, and adhesives. In this review long-term trends in workplace exposures to TDI are assessed in both the producing and using industries, and respiratory health effects of TDI are evaluated in relation to workplace TDI concentrations. The key respiratory health effects associated with repeated or long-term TDI exposure are bronchial asthma and an accelerated rate of decline in lung function. In the early years of the industry, annual incidence rates of occupational asthma (OA) due to TDI ranged from 1% to as high as 5 to 6%, depending on the extent of engineering and work practice controls in the various workplaces. Since the mid-1970s, annual OA incidence rates have been <1%, where 8 h TDI concentrations have been maintained below 5 ppb as determined by personal monitoring, even where short-termTDI concentrations above 20 ppb and less frequently above 40 ppb were routinely detected. In these latter settings, there is evidence that the majority of OA cases may be attributable to TDI concentrations well above 20 ppb associated with overexposure incidents. Further study is needed regarding the role of such incidents in inducing respiratory sensitization. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of lung function have indicated that continued exposure after development of work-related respiratory symptoms can lead to transient or accelerated fixed declines in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1). These findings are congruent with the FEV1 declines demonstrated in general population studies of persons with persistent bronchial hyperresponsiveness or nonoccupational asthma. More recent longitudinal studies in settings with ongoing medical surveillance have provided no consistent evidence of accelerated FEV1 loss among employees exposed up to 5 ppb TDI on an 8 h time-weighted average basis.
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells are characterized by chemoresistance associated with glutathione (GSH) metabolism. Ethacrynic acid (EA) is able to inhibit the detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST), which catalyzes the conjugation between GSH and Pt-based drugs. With the aim of obtaining active bifunctional drugs, a Pt(II) complex containing two EA moieties as leaving groups, namely cis-diamminobis(ethacrynato)platinum(II), was synthesized, characterized, and tested on four MPM cell lines. The resulting antiproliferative activity was compared with that elicited by the analogue Pt(IV) complex, cis,cis,trans-diamminodichloridobis(ethacrynato)platinum(IV) (ethacraplatin) and by the co-administration of free EA and cisplatin. The Pt(II) and Pt(IV) bifunctional complexes showed poorer performance than the reference drug cisplatin alone or in combination with EA. After treatment, cellular GST activity remained consistently unchanged, while the GSH level increased.
In patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), zidovudine has been known to cause a severe hypoproliferative anemia that resolves promptly when the drug is stopped. Some patients, however, may come to medical attention after having stopped taking the drug for 1-2 weeks and may already be in the recovery phase and present with severe anemia, normoblastemia, and reticulocytosis. These features can be mistaken for hemolytic disease, as shown by our experience with three such patients.
One clinical intervention against the negative outcomes associated with atherothrombotic vascular disease (AVD) is low-dose, chronic aspirin therapy. However, epidemiological studies suggest that recurrence of adverse vascular events with aspirin therapy is growing and associated with therapy duration. The contributors to this outcome are unclear and include poor patient compliance and aspirin-resistant platelet thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) production. Based on previous results in hypercholesterolemic mice, we hypothesized that elevated aspirin-insensitive arachidonic acid (AA)-induced TxA(2) production by the vascular endothelium contributes to aspirin resistance in AVD independent of platelet behavior. AA-induced dilation was blunted in aortic rings and in arterioles from apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene deletion mice (vs. C57/Bl6/J), partially due to elevated TxA(2) production. Acute inhibition of cyclooxygenases or TxA(2) synthase attenuated the increased TxA(2) production in ApoE and LDLR and improved AA-induced dilation, responses that were mirrored by chronic treatment with low-dose aspirin of 16 wk duration. However, this effect was not temporally stable, and, with longer-duration therapy, the beneficial impact of aspirin on outcomes diminished. A similar, though less robust, pattern to the impact of chronic aspirin therapy on vascular outcomes was identified with chronic antioxidant treatment (TEMPOL). These results suggest that in dyslipidemic mice, the beneficial impact of chronic aspirin therapy on improving vascular outcomes decay with time and that a contributing element to subsequent negative vascular events may be the development of aspirin-resistant TxA(2) production by the vasculature itself.
The human pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a ligand-regulated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. PXR is activated by a large, structurally diverse, set of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds and coordinates the expression of genes central to metabolism and excretion of potentially harmful chemicals and therapeutic drugs in humans. Walrycin A is a novel antibacterial compound targeting the WalK/WalR two-component signal transduction system of Gram (+) bacteria. Here, we report that, in hepatoma cells, walrycin A potently activates a gene set known to be regulated by the xenobiotic sensor PXR. Walrycin A was as efficient as the reference PXR agonist rifampicin to activate PXR in a transactivation assay at noncytotoxic concentrations. Using a limited proteolysis assay, we show that walrycin A induces conformational changes at a concentration which correlates with walrycin A ability to enhance the expression of prototypic target genes, suggesting that walrycin A interacts with PXR. The activation of the canonical human PXR target gene CYP3A4 by walrycin A is dose and PXR dependent. Finally, in silico docking experiments suggest that the walrycin A oxidation product Russig's blue is the actual ligand for PXR. Taken together, these results identify walrycin A as a novel human PXR activator.
A clinical and electrophysiological follow up study of 14 cases of hemopathic patients patients undergoing VCR therapy showed evidence that the drug has a direct action on the motor and sensory axon but not on the propagation velocity. Sensory nerves seem to be affected earlier and more than motor ones. Correlation was good between clinical and electrophysiological findings for both functions. The findings in man correspond with the animal data and therefore lead to the conclusion that VCR polyneuropathy is due to an involvement of the nerve axon.
2,2-Dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HCFC-123) has been developed as a substitute for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). It is a structural analogue of halothane and similarities in the metabolic pathways and liver toxicity of both compounds have been described. The present study was initiated after an accidental outbreak of hepatitis in an industrial setting to examine whether concomitant exposure to 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC-124), which is not hepatotoxic, could enhance the liver toxicity of HCFC-123. Male Hartley guinea-pigs were exposed for 4 h to 5,000 ppm HCFC-123 alone or blended with 5,000 ppm HCFC-124, either once (single exposure) or on 5 consecutive days (repeated exposure). The animals were killed either 24 or 48 h after the last exposure. A transient cytolytic action of HCFC-123 was evident by increased mean serum levels of alanine aminotransferase at 24 h and isocitrate dehydrogenase at 24 and 48 h, both after a single or repeated exposure. The liver toxicity of HCFC-123 was confirmed by pathological examination of liver tissue, which showed mild (foci of necrotic hepatocytes) to moderate (multifocal random degeneration and necrosis) damage. Steatosis was also observed and was more pronounced after repeated exposure than after single. One animal out of 6 that were repeatedly exposed to the blend and sacrificed at 24 h showed liver lesions similar to halothane hepatitis. Although a few other animals responded markedly in the blend-treated group, on average, no significant difference in the biochemical or pathological lesions was found between the groups treated with HCFC-123 alone or with the blend. Urinary excretion of trifluoroacetic acid and chlorodifluoroacetic acid increased dose-dependently upon exposure to HCFC-123 and indicated accumulation after repeated exposure. No difference in metabolite excretion was found between animals treated with HCFC-123 alone or blended with HCFC-124. Treatment with HCFC-123 depleted hepatic glutathione levels by about 40 and 25% after single and repeated exposure, respectively; the amplitude of this reduction was not modified by co-exposure to HCFC-124. In conclusion, this study confirmed the hepatotoxicity of HCFC-123, based on biochemical, histopathological and metabolite studies, and found only very limited indication of a potentiation by HCFC-124 of this hepatotoxic effect.
Mitochondria generate reactive oxygen and peroxynitrite and release endonucleases during acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity. Because mitochondrial translocation of Bax can initiate these events, we investigated the potential role of Bax in the pathophysiology of hepatic necrosis after 300 mg/kg APAP in fasted C57BL/6 mice. APAP overdose induced Bax translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria as early as 1 h after APAP injection. At 6 h, there was extensive centrilobular nitrotyrosine staining (indicator for peroxynitrite formation) and nuclear DNA fragmentation. In addition, mitochondrial intermembrane proteins were released into the cytosol. Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities of 5610 +/- 600 U/l indicated extensive necrotic cell death. Conversely, Bax gene knockout (Bax(-/-)) mice had 80% lower ALT activities, less DNA fragmentation, and less intermembrane protein release at 6 h. However, immunohistochemical staining for nitrotyrosine or APAP protein adducts did not show differences between wild-type and Bax(-/-) mice. In contrast to the early hepatoprotection in Bax(-/-) mice, plasma ALT activities (7605 +/- 480 U/l) and area of necrosis (53 +/- 6% hepatocytes) in wild-type animals was similar to values in Bax(-/-) mice at 12 h. In addition, there was no difference in DNA fragmentation or nitrotyrosine immunostaining. We concluded that the rapid mitochondrial Bax translocation after APAP overdose has no effect on peroxynitrite formation but that it contributes to the mitochondrial release of proteins, which cause nuclear DNA fragmentation. However, the persistent oxidant stress and peroxynitrite formation in mitochondria may eventually trigger the permeability transition pore opening and release intermembrane proteins independently of Bax.
Clinical resistance to pentavalent antimonial drugs in the form of sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) has become a major problem in the treatment of kala azar (visceral leishmaniasis) in India. The mechanism of resistance is unclear in these clinical isolates, although work has been conducted with Leishmania species mutants selected in vitro by stepwise increase of drug concentration, using antimony-related metal arsenic and, more recently, SAG. In the present study, we investigated the molecular aspect of drug resistance in clinically confirmed SAG-resistant field isolates. Our results show that the mechanisms of resistance postulated for laboratory mutants of Leishmania species are not operating in field isolates of Leishmania donovani. Instead, we identified a novel gene amplified in these drug-resistant parasites whose locus is on chromosome 9. The significant finding was that this isolated fragment confers antimony resistance to wild-type Leishmania species after transfection. We speculate that protein phosphorylation may play a role in signal transduction pathway in the parasite after exposure to drug-conferring resistance.
Standard antituberculous therapy including isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide is widely used for the treatment of active tuberculosis. Its most important side effect is hepatotoxicity, ranging from asymptomatic transaminitis to fulminant hepatic failure. A 19-year-old woman was admitted to our unit due to jaundice and unconsciousness. According to her past medical history, she was diagnosed as having extrapulmonary tuberculosis and had been prescribed standard antituberculous therapy. The patient became icteric and unconscious on the fourth day after therapy initiation. She was diagnosed with drug-induced acute fulminant hepatic failure and underwent living-related liver transplantation. Nonhepatotoxic antituberculous therapy (cycloserine, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and ethambutol) and low-dose immunosuppressive therapy were started after transplantation. Currently the patient is very well with normal graft function 42 months after transplantation. Here we report a case of a patient with acute fulminant hepatic failure caused by isoniazid, rifampicin, or both, who was successfully treated with living-related liver transplantation and a relatively less hepatotoxic antituberculous therapy. In conclusion, liver transplantation is a feasible therapy for individuals with standard antituberculous therapy-induced hepatic failure. Nonhepatotoxic antituberculous therapy may achieve control of active tuberculosis in such individuals after transplantation.
Ifosfamide is one of the most widely used alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. Before mesna was introduced, its dose-limiting toxicity was hemorrhagic cystitis, but at present, neurotoxicity is one of its most worrisome side effects. A total of 10%-15% of patients treated with ifosfamide develop an encephalopathy. The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the development of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy (IIE) are not known. However, accumulation of chloracetaldehyde, toxic metabolite of ifosfamide, in the central nervous system is theorized to be the cause of the neurotoxicity. No standard treatment has been available for IIE. Recently, many reports suggested that methylene blue (MB) may be an effective treatment of this lethal complication. We report two cases of IIE and their treatment outcomes. The first patient recovered completely with MB. The other patient showed slow and incomplete improvement without using MB. We suggest that MB can be used as an initial treatment for the encephalopathy related to ifosfamide infusion. Thus, we present these two cases with brief review of related literature.
In order to clarify the mechanism underlying testicular toxicity of nitrofurazone (NF), two experiments were performed. In experiment 1, sequential histopathological examination of testes after a single oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg NF to male rats demonstrated that degeneration of pachytene spermatocytes with an eosinophilic, shrunken appearance in stages VII-VIII and vacuolation of Sertoli cells were first observed 12 h after treatment. By 24 h, degeneration of pachytene spermatocytes in stages VII-XII and diplotene spermatocytes were observed. On post-treatment day 4, neither spermatocytes nor spermatids located inside the pachytene spermatocytes in stage VII were seen anywhere. Generation of seminiferous epithelium progressed with recovery to almost normal morphology after 12 weeks, although some morphological changes were still present. No lesions were apparent in spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, leptotene spermatocytes, zygotene spermatocytes or Leydig cells. Degenerate pachytene spermatocytes and some round spermatids seen after 24 h showed positive TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). In addition, DNA laddering patterns were detected with agarose gel electrophoresis, and increased electron density of nuclei and cytoplasm of degenerating spermatocytes with nuclear chromatin focal aggregations were observed by electron microscopy, indicating that cell death was attributable to apoptosis. In experiment 2, sequential serum sex-related hormone levels were assayed after a single oral administration of 300 mg/kg NF to male rats and revealed a significant increase of testosterone and a decrease of progesterone at 6 h, and decreases of luteinizing hormone at 12 h and testosterone at 24 h. Prolactin tended to decrease from 12 h after treatment and the decrease was significant at 48 h. No significant changes were observed in levels of follicle-stimulating hormone or estradiol. The probability that NF damages germ cells by causing a hormonal imbalance is extremely low, since no pattern of hormonal imbalance that could be regarded as the cause of the testicular degeneration was observed until 12 h after NF treatment when pachytene spermatocytes began to degenerate. The present experiments suggest that NF damages Sertoli cells and pachytene spermatocytes in stages VII-XII directly.
Teratogenicity and neuropathy are the well known serious side effects induced by thalidomide. We describe 5 cases of thrombotic events occurring within a brief delay after the onset of thalidomide in a manner that suggests that thalidomide could have acted as a precipiting or as a starting factor in these events.
Five patients including 4 patients with lupus erythematosus (1 discoid lupus, 1 subacute lupus and 2 systemic lupus erythematosus) and one patient with a severe atopic dermatitis, all without previous history of vascular events, developed an arterial thrombosis (2 cases) or a venous thrombosis (3 cases), severe in 4 cases, few days or weeks after the onset of thalidomide treatment (50 to 100 mg daily).
All the patients had risk factors of thrombosis: the presence of antiphospholipids and/or anticardiolipin antibodies in lupus erythematosus patients and a trauma in the atopic case. However the absence of a previous story of thrombosis, its rapid occurrence after the onset of thalidomide and its severity are intriguing. In addition, recent studies demonstrate that thalidomide has various effects that would act, among other things, on angiogenesis. Thus, we think that a doubt exists on a negative effect of thalidomide in thrombosis risk factors patients and that this hypothesis has to be confirmed.
Seven patients treated with intraarterial internal carotid 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) chemotherapy for malignant gliomas of the brain had postinjection angiographic demonstration of increased orbital vascularity and vasodilatation, sometimes associated with arteriovenous shunting. Subjective orbital discomfort reported by the patients during chemotherapy correlated with this orbital hyperemia. Some therapeutic suggestions for managing this undesirable effect of BCNU chemotherapy are discussed.
To develop a quantitative multiparametric PROPELLER (periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach and its application in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN) chemically induced rodent model of hepatocarcinogenesis for lesion characterization.
In nine rats with 33 cirrhosis-associated hepatic nodules including regenerative nodule (RN), dysplastic nodule (DN), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and cyst, multiparametric PROPELLER MRI (diffusion-weighted, T2/M0 (proton density) mapping and T1-weighted) were performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, T2 and M0 maps of each tumor were generated. We compared ADC, T2, and M0 measurements for each type of hepatic nodule, confirmed at histopathology.
PROPELLER images and resultant parametric maps were inherently coregistered without image distortion or motion artifacts. All types of hepatic nodules demonstrated complex imaging characteristics within conventional T1- and T2-weighted images. Quantitatively, cysts were distinguished from RN, DN, and HCC with significantly higher ADC and T2; however, there was no significant difference of ADC and T2 between HCC, DN, and RN. Mean tumor M0 values of HCC were significantly higher than those of DN, RN, and cysts.
This study exploited quantitative PROPELLER MRI and multidimensional analysis approaches in an attempt to differentiate hepatic nodules in the DEN rodent model of hepatocarcinogenesis. This method offers great potential for parallel parameterization during noninvasive interrogation of hepatic tissue properties.
Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue used for treatment of multiple cancers. Recent reports describe small to medium vessel vasculitis as a rare complication of therapy. We report a case of significant large vessel vasculitis presenting as fever of unknown origin in a patient treated adjuvantly with docetaxel and gemcitabine for uterine leiomyosarcoma.The patient presented after her first and second exposure to chemotherapy with fever of unknown origin and worsening subsequent chest and neck discomfort. Extensive workup revealed radiographic and laboratory evidence of aortic vasculitis. We initiated treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, and the patient's condition resolved without complication over the next several weeks.To our knowledge, this represents the first case of gemcitabine-induced large vessel vasculitis which presented in our case as fever of unknown origin. Awareness of this potential complication is essential as discontinuing the inciting drug and initiating corticosteroid treatment can be life-saving.
In order to investigate the potential involvement of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) dysfunction in myotoxicity associated with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) treatment, assessment was made of ETC activity and ubiquinone status in two patients experiencing myopathy following treatment with simvastatin (40 mg/day) and cyclosporin (patient 1) and simvastatin (40 mg/day) and itraconazole (patient 2). Analysis of skeletal muscle biopsies revealed a decreased ubiquinone status (77 and 132; reference range: 140-580 pmol/mg) and cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) activity (0.006 and 0.007 reference range: 0.014-0.034). To assess statin treatment in the absence of possible pharmacological interference from cyclosporin or itraconazole, primary astrocytes were cultured with lovastatin (100 microM). Lovastatin treatment resulted in a decrease in ubiquinone (97.9 +/- 14.9; control: 202.9 +/- 18.4 pmol/mg; p < 0.05), and complex IV activity (0.008 +/- 0.001; control: 0.011 +/- 0.001; p < 0.05) relative to control. These data, coupled with the patient findings, indicate a possible association between statin treatment, decreased ubiquinone status, and loss of complex IV activity.
Central nervous system toxicity of H2-receptor antagonists has rarely been confirmed by the respective elevated cerebrospinal fluid drug concentrations. We observed two hemodialyzed neurosurgical patients in whom mental deterioration and convulsions developed after intravenous famotidine therapy (10 and 40 mg/day). Their cerebrospinal fluid drug concentrations were grossly elevated (i.e., 160 and 249 ng/ml) compared with those obtained from three other hemodialyzed neurosurgical patients who exhibited no central nervous system reactions (i.e., 47 to 85 ng/ml). In addition, the mean cerebrospinal fluid/plasma drug concentration ratio obtained from these five neurosurgical patients with renal failure (i.e., 0.46) and that from 10 other neurosurgical patients with normal renal function (i.e., 0.41) were about four times greater than that previously reported from non-neurosurgical patients with normal renal function (i.e., 0.12). Our observation suggests that patients with not only renal dysfunction but also following neurosurgical operations have an excessive accumulation of famotidine in the central nervous system and are more susceptible to the drug-induced adverse central nervous system reactions.
Ischemia and reperfusion injury of the skeletal muscle is a common and serious condition observed in patients admitting to peripheral vascular surgery, interventional radiology and cardiology departments. Resveratrol (RVT) being a strong natural antioxidant is found in deal of red wine and Mediterranean diet. In the present study, male Spraque-Dawley rats were randomized into two groups of equal size. The first group was the control group, and these rats were administered with tap water with a gastric tube for fourteen consecutive days once daily. According to the same protocol, the rats in the second group were treated with tap water containing 20 mg/kg RVT. All the rats in the two groups were subjected to acute hind limb ischemia through clamping of the abdominal aorta for 120 min. Following this procedure, 60 minutes of reperfusion was applied by reestablishing blood flow in both iliac arteries. Ischemic damage in the skeletal muscle tissue was assessed by measuring myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase, aspartate transaminase enzymes in venous blood samples obtained at the end of the reperfusion period. Oxidative stress caused by reperfusion was determined by measuring MDA, carbonyl and protein sulphydryl levels in quadriceps muscle tissue retrieved at the end of the experiment. In Group II rats, all the measured ischemic enzymes and the markers of oxidative stress reflected robust anti-ischemic properties obtained by RVT administration. The data from both groups revealed statistically significant protection against acute skeletal muscle ischemia and reperfusion injury in Group II rats, compared to Group I. As a major dietary flavonoid RVT can protect the skeletal muscle tissue against global ischemia and reperfusion injury because of its strong antioxidant and cytoprotective properties.
