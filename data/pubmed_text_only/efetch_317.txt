Repellent guidance molecules provide targeting information to outgrowing axons along predetermined pathways during development. These molecules may also play a role in synaptic reorganization in the adult brain and thereby promote epileptogenesis. Our aim was to investigate the expression of Slit2, one of repellent guidance molecules, in temporal lobe epileptic foci from epileptic patients and experimental animals. Thirty-five temporal neocortex tissue samples from patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and fifteen histological normal temporal lobes from controls were selected. Fifty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into six groups, including five groups with epilepsy induced by lithium-pilocarpine administration and one control group. Temporal lobe tissue samples were taken from rats at 1, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days post-seizure and from controls. Expression of Slit2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis. Slit2 was mainly expressed in neurons in human controls and in both neurons and astrocytes in TLE patients. Slit2 expression was significantly higher in TLE patients as compared with the controls. Slit2-positive cells were mainly neurons in the rat temporal lobe tissues of the control group, the acute period group, and the latent period group, while the Slit2-positive cells were mainly astrocytes in chronic phase. Compared with controls, Slit2 expression in animals in the TLE group gradually decreased from days 1 to 14 post-seizure, but then increased over the levels seen in controls, to peak levels at days 30 and 60. These results suggest that Slit2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of TLE.
Postoperative delirium occurs in about 2% of patients undergoing major cardiac surgery including coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG). Haloperidol (Sabex, Boucherville, Canada) is a drug commonly used in the intensive care unit for the treatment of delirium and is usually considered safe even at high doses and is rarely implicated in the development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. The purpose of this study is to report such a complication of use of haloperidol after myocardial revascularization.
The patient reported underwent uneventful triple bypass surgery. Administration of large intravenous doses of haloperidol was necessary for control of psychomotor agitation due to delirium. Torsades de pointes occurred in the absence of QT prolongation on the third postoperative day following use of the drug with no other obvious etiological factor.
Awareness of this rare complication is key to judicious use of this drug in the post CABG patient in whom such an arrhythmia may have very deleterious consequences because of the underlying cardiac condition.
To report the case of a patient with HIT that received a prolonged infusion of r-hirudin (lepirudin; Refludan; Hoechst, France) before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for aortic surgery. Although administration of r-hirudin for CPB anticoagulation has previously been reported, many questions persist concerning the best therapeutic regimen for CPB anticoagulation as well as the time of onset and the doses for postoperative anticoagulation.
A 65-yr-old man was admitted for surgery of aortic stenosis after an episode of acute pulmonary edema complicated by deep venous thrombosis in the context of documented HIT. The patient received r-hirudin for 13 dy before surgery at doses (0.4 mg x kg(-1) bolus followed by 0.15 mg x kg(-1) x hr(-1) continuous infusion) that maintained activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratios between 2 and 2.5. Anticoagulation for CPB was performed with r-hirudin given as 0.1 mg x kg(-1) i.v. bolus and 0.2 mg kg(-1) in the CPB priming volume. Anticoagulation during CPB was monitored with the whole blood activated coagulation time and ecarin clotting time (ECT) performed in the operating room with values corresponding to r-hirudin concentrations >5 microg x ml(-1) during CPB. Anticoagulation during CPB was uneventful. Two bleeding episodes, related to the r-hirudin regimen and necessitating allogeneic blood transfusion, occurred after surgery.
This case report confirms previous experience of the use of r-hirudin for anticoagulation during CPB and provides additional information in the context of prolonged r-hirudin infusion before and after CPB.
Recent work has shown that time-of-day influences drug-seeking behavior. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that the master circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN) is required for generating day:night differences in drug-seeking behavior, specifically the acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Sham and SCN-lesioned (SCNx) rats were trained for cocaine-induced CPP behavior at either ZT4 (Zeitgeber time 4, 4 h after lights-on) or ZT12 (lights-off). After being tested for side preference, rats were allowed to extinguish CPP. This was followed by cocaine-induced reinstatement with 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cocaine. SCNx animals exhibited no 24-h locomotor activity rhythm. Acquisition of CPP behavior did not vary with time-of-day, but was greater in SCNx animals. Sham rats tested at ZT12 took significantly longer to extinguish CPP behavior compared to ZT4, an effect completely abolished by SCN lesions. Cocaine-induced reinstatement of CPP did not vary with time of day in sham rats. However, SCNx animals tested at ZT4 trended towards greater reinstatement to the low dose of cocaine, and displayed significantly less reinstatement to the higher dose of cocaine than sham rats. Additionally, SCNx rats tested for reinstatement to the lower dose of cocaine displayed greater reinstatement at ZT4 than at ZT12. We conclude that: 1) acquisition of CPP behavior does not vary between the two times of day tested but is influenced tonically by the SCN, 2) extinction of cocaine CPP varies with time-of-day and this variation depends critically on the SCN, and 3) reinstatement of cocaine CPP does not vary between the two times of day tested. However, day:night differences in reinstatement are unmasked in animals lacking an SCN, suggesting the possibility that an extra-SCN oscillator is responsible for generating variation in this cocaine-seeking behavior.
Assess modifications of sexual function in men treated with intrathecal baclofen for spinal spasticity.
Prospective before-after trial.
A rehabilitation department of a university hospital; follow-up was on an outpatient basis.
A convenience sample of nine consecutively recruited men with spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis who were receiving intrathecal baclofen by an implantable pump; average follow-up was 44.4 months.
A questionnaire focusing on: libido; ability to sustain reflexive and psychogenic erections; rigidity, evaluated by a visual analog scale; maximum duration of erection; possibility of ejaculation.
Libido and the ability to obtain psychogenic or reflexogenic erections were not modified. However, eight patients reported a decrease of erection rigidity and/or duration. Ejaculation was possible in three cases before implantation. It disappeared in two patients, and was more difficult to obtain in the last one. It reappeared after treatment withdrawal. No differences were found between multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injured patients.
Intrathecal baclofen may compromise erection and ejaculation. This effect is reversible. Patients should be informed of this effect.
Early case reports of fatal hematologic effects attributed to carbamazepine (CBZ) resulted in extensive monitoring recommendations by the manufacturer. The rarity of blood dyscrasias led many authors to question the manufacturer's guidelines. Thus the manufacturer removed specific monitoring guidelines, allowing physicians to monitor CBZ using their clinical judgment. This article reviews case reports and studies of CBZ's hematologic effects. Due to their rapid onset, daily laboratory checks would be necessary to monitor for aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. These adverse effects are best monitored by informing patients and physicians to carefully watch for signs and symptoms. Leukopenia develops more slowly, occurring in approximately 12 percent of children and 7 percent of adults. Its onset is typically within the first three months of treatment, with patients at risk having a low or low-normal pretreatment white blood cell (WBC) count. Leukopenia often reverses, even if CBZ is continued. Based upon our review of the literature, we recommend monitoring of those high-risk patients during the first three months of treatment with the frequency being determined by results of each laboratory value. WBC counts less than 3000/mm3 or neutrophil counts below 1000/mm3 warrant a decrease in dose with frequent monitoring or CBZ discontinuation, if necessary.
Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) is the major ingredient in more than 70 over-the-counter preparations including diet pills, nasal decongestants, and the legal "look-alike" stimulants. Structurally and functionally similar to amphetamine and ephedrine, PPA has recently been associated with several neurological manifestations including psychosis, stroke, severe headache, seizures, and intracerebral hematoma. We report a case of intracerebral hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage in a young woman with angiographic and biopsy-proven vasculitis of the central nervous system (CNS) induced by PPA in her diet pills. From review of the literature, we distinguish drug-induced vasculitis as a separate entity from primary CNS vasculitis, both clinically and pathologically. This report should alert physicians, in general, to this potentially fatal side effect of PPA, a commonly used over-the-counter drug. Also, neurosurgeons in particular should consider the possibility of drug-induced vasculitis when faced with cases of intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage without apparent cause.
Ropivacaine, a recently introduced local anesthetic of the amide family (1), seems to show less toxicity than bupivacaine (2-4). Nevertheless, both neurologic and cardiovascular toxicities are possible. Six cases of ropivacaine-induced convulsions have previously been reported (5-10), of which three cases also showed cardiovascular toxicity. In three cases, total plasma concentrations were measured (Table 1).
Exposure to 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) causes persistent neurotoxicity, while its reproductive toxicity in female rats is transient, indicating that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and gonadotrophs receive little or no damage from IDPN and that the transient gonadal toxicity may be also observed in males. To clarify these points, the acute toxic effects of IDPN on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of male rats were examined histologically, biochemically and serologically. A single intraperitoneal injection of IDPN (1000 mg/kg body weight) induced signs of neurotoxicity within a day; nevertheless, GnRH neurons were not affected throughout the experimental period. Four days after IDPN treatment, the plasma level of testosterone but not gonadotropins decreased and active caspase 3-immunopositive spermatids increased; both parameters returned to normal levels afterwards. Data from our studies revealed that while IDPN had little or no toxic effect on GnRH neurons or gonadotrophs it was transiently toxic to gonads in both sexes.
Clozapine is an atypical neuroleptic drug that was initially thought not to cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). We report a case of NMS associated with clozapine as a single agent that developed in a patient with no prior history of NMS. In contrast to other reported cases of NMS with clozapine monotherapy in which rigidity was reported to be absent, our patient had classic NMS with lead-pipe rigidity. NMS should be included in the differential diagnosis of a febrile patient with a history of any neuroleptic treatment, including clozapine.
Heparan sulphate proteoglycans are major components of the liver extracellular matrix. Their cleavage by heparanase (endo-beta-glucuronidase) may thus be involved in liver-specific normal and pathological processes. Heparanase mRNA and protein were expressed during liver development but not in the mature healthy liver. A biphasic gain of heparanase expression, detected by immunostaining, western blotting, and real-time RT-PCR, was clearly noted following partial hepatectomy, peaking at 12 and 96-168 h and subsiding 2 weeks post-surgery. Expression of heparan sulphate gradually increased throughout the regeneration process. Unlike heparanase, baseline levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) were detected in the intact liver, increasing up to 4 days following partial hepatectomy and subsiding at day 10. Bands matching MMP-9 were absent prior to hepatectomy, but visible 2 h post-hepatectomy. Thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis was associated with increased levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2, correlating with the severity of the disease. Elevated heparanase levels were noted in the early stages of fibrosis, with no further increase evident in rats exhibiting higher fibrotic grades. Taken together, these data suggest a role for heparanase during liver development and remodelling.
The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of controlled-release (CR) melatonin in the treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome and impaired sleep maintenance of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities including autistic spectrum disorders. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of CR melatonin (5 mg) followed by a 3-month open-label study was conducted during which the dose was gradually increased until the therapy showed optimal beneficial effects. Sleep characteristics were measured by caregiver who completed somnologs and wrist actigraphs. Clinician rating of severity of the sleep disorder and improvement from baseline, along with caregiver ratings of global functioning and family stress were also obtained. Fifty-one children (age range 2-18 years) who did not respond to sleep hygiene intervention were enrolled. Fifty patients completed the crossover trial and 47 completed the open-label phase. Recordings of total night-time sleep and sleep latency showed significant improvement of approximately 30 min. Similarly, significant improvement was observed in clinician and parent ratings. There was additional improvement in the open-label somnolog measures of sleep efficiency and the longest sleep episode in the open-label phase. Overall, the therapy improved the sleep of 47 children and was effective in reducing family stress. Children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, who had treatment resistant chronic delayed sleep phase syndrome and impaired sleep maintenance, showed improvement in melatonin therapy.
Two patients developed asterixis while they were taking carbamazepine at "therapeutic" levels. The only laboratory abnormality was slight hyperammonemia. It occurred with normal hepatic function as a dose-related effect. In fact, the blood ammonia level decreased and asterixis ceased when carbamazepine was stopped or reduced in dosage. The relationship between asterixis and hyperammonemia during carbamazepine therapy is discussed.
Two experiments examined the effects of reductions in cortical cholinergic function on performance of a novel task that allowed for the simultaneous assessment of attention to a visual stimulus and memory for that stimulus over a variable delay within the same test session. In the first experiment, infusions of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) produced many omissions but did not impair rats' ability to correctly detect a brief visual stimulus. However, these animals were highly impaired in remembering the location of that stimulus following a delay period, although in a delay-independent manner. In the second experiment, another group of animals with selective 192 IgG-saporin lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM) were not impaired under conditions of low-attentional demand. However, when the stimulus duration was reduced, a significant memory impairment was observed, but similar to the results of the first experiment, the nBM-lesioned animals were not impaired in attentional accuracy, although aspects of attention were compromised (e.g., omissions). These findings demonstrate that (1) cortical cholinergic depletion produces dissociable deficits in attention and memory, depending on the task demands, (2) delay-independent mnemonic deficits produced by scopolamine are probably due to impairments other than simple inattention, and (3) working memory deficits are not simply dependent on attentional difficulties per se. Together, these findings implicate the nBM cortical cholinergic system in both attentional and mnemonic processing.
Chronic renal failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after orthotopic liver transplantation. We did a randomised controlled trial of mycophenolate mofetil monotherapy in liver transplant patients who developed renal failure associated with calcineurin-inhibitor (ciclosporin or tacrolimus) immunosuppressive therapy. Although renal failure improved when the calcineurin-inhibitor dose was reduced and ultimately stopped, the trial was stopped when three of five patients on monotherapy developed organ rejection requiring a second transplantation.
Thirty-four multidrug-resistant cases of Indian visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) were treated with amphotericin B. A complete hemogram, liver and renal function tests, determination of serum electrolyte levels, a chest radiograph, and an electrocardiogram were done before, during, and after completion of therapy. Assessment for clinical and parasitologic cure was done weekly. Thirty-one patients who completed treatment had full cure after receiving 10-15 injections at six-months follow up. One patient died of myocarditis. A febrile reaction was observed in all cases, while thrombophlebitis was found in six cases (18.75%). Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting were found in seven cases (21.88%). No significant nephrotoxicity or electrolyte disturbances were observed. It is concluded that amphotericin B is an effective second-line drug for Indian visceral leishmaniasis, but unpredictable drug-induced myocarditis remains a problem.
There are few reports in the literature related to sulfonylurea-induced hepatotoxicity. We describe the case of acute hepatitis induced by gliclazide, a second generation sulfonylurea. A 60-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus (type 2) developed an acute icteric hepatitis-like illness 6 weeks after the initiation of gliclazide therapy. Other causes of acute hepatocellular necrosis were excluded. Liver histology showed marked portal inflammation with lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils, associated with lobular inflammation (indicative of a histological pattern consistent with drug-induced hepatitis). The drug was immediately withdrawn and the patient was given glibenclamide. The patient recovered clinically and, in less than 4 weeks, her serum bilirubin and aminotransferases returned to normal levels. We believe that this is the first description of acute hepatitis caused by an idiosyncratic adverse reaction to gliclazide or to one of its metabolites. In conclusion, this case strongly suggests that gliclazide can induce acute icteric liver necro-inflammation which may be misdiagnosed clinically as acute viral hepatitis. In patients who show abnormal liver function tests, the immediate discontinuation of gliclazide is recommended.
Studies were conducted to evaluate whether the timing of administration of ICRF-187 [(+)-1,2-bis(3,5 dioxopiperazinyl-1-yl)propane] would influence the degree of cardioprotection provided by this agent against the development of doxorubicin-induced chronic cardiomyopathy. Beagle dogs (8.5-14 kg) received either doxorubicin alone (1.75 mg/kg, i.v., n = 8), doxorubicin (1.75 mg/kg) simultaneously with ICRF-187 (35 mg/kg, i.v., n = 8), or doxorubicin (1.75 mg/kg) followed 2 h later by ICRF-187 (35 mg/kg, n = 8). Control animals received ICRF-187 (35 mg/kg, n = 4) or saline (n = 4). All animals received a course of seven treatments, each given 3 weeks apart, and were killed 3 weeks after the last treatment. Semiquantitative grading of histologic sections of myocardium showed that as compared with animals treated with doxorubicin alone, the incidence and the severity of the doxorubicin-induced myocardial lesions were reduced in the two groups of animals given doxorubicin plus ICRF-187. However, protection was significantly better in dogs receiving ICRF-187 and doxorubicin simultaneously than in those given ICRF-187 2 h after doxorubicin. These observations were interpreted as indicating that the timing of administration of ICRF-187 with respect to that of doxorubicin is an important factor in determining the degree of cardioprotection and that there is a "time window" in which ICRF-187 exerts optimal effects.
Adenosine antagonists have been previously shown to be of benefit in some ischaemic and nephrotoxic models of acute renal failure (ARF). In the present study, the effects of three alkylxanthines with different potencies as adenosine antagonists 8-phenyltheophylline, theophylline and enprofylline, were examined in rats developing acute renal failure after 4 daily injections of gentamicin (200 mg kg-1). Renal function was assessed by biochemical (plasma urea and creatinine), functional (urine analysis and [3H]inulin and [14C]p-aminohippuric acid clearances) and morphological (degree of necrosis) indices. The various drug treatments produced improvements in some, but not all, measurements of renal function. However, any improvement produced by drug treatment was largely a result of a beneficial effect exerted by its vehicle (polyethylene glycol and NaOH). The lack of any consistent protective effect noted with the alkylxanthines tested in the present study indicates that adenosine plays little, if any, pathophysiological role in gentamicin-induced ARF.
The cannabinoid (CB1) receptor agonist HU-210 (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) exhibited a pronounced antiarrhythmic effect in rats with the adrenaline (epinephrine) and aconitine induced arrhythmia models. At the same time, the intracerebrovascular introduction of HU-210 (500 or 5000 ng) did not affect the adrenaline-induced arrhythmia. The CB1 receptor pretreatment (blocking) with the SR 141716 antagonist (3 mg/kg) and the introduction of a ganglion blocker (hexamethonium, 10 mg/kg) did not inhibit the antiarrhythmic effect of HU-210. It is concluded that the antiarrhythmic effect of intravenously injected HU-210 is neither related to the CB 1 receptor activation nor mediated by the autonomous (vegetative) nervous system.
"Enflurane hepatitis" has only recently been accepted as a disease entity. As far as the authors know, this paper is the first report on enflurane hepatitis in a patient with a previous history of halothane hepatitis. Our conclusion is that a potent halogenated inhalation agent should never be given to a patient if a prior administration of another such agent has led to the development of hepatic injury.
METHODS OF CURRENT TRIALS: Several ongoing trials are investigating the anti-atherosclerotic effects of antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients. Changes in carotid intimal-medial thicknesses and atherosclerotic plaques are being explored by a sensitive quantitative B-mode ultrasound technique. MULTICENTER ISRADIPINE/DIURETIC ATHEROSCLEROSIS STUDY (MIDAS): The results from this pioneering study indicated a slower progression, at least in the first 6 months, of carotid plaques in isradipine-treated patients than in diuretic-treated patients. MIDAS has been particularly valuable in giving information on the rate of growth of intimal-medial thickness in hypertensive patients and on the best end-point to use in carotid ultrasound trials. EUROPEAN LACIDIPINE STUDY ON ATHEROSCLEROSIS (ELSA) AND VERAPAMIL IN HYPERTENSION AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS STUDY (VHAS): Baseline data from these two ongoing studies have provided evidence of the very high prevalence of carotid lesions among hypertensive patients: the prevalence of plaques (defined as a carotid intimal-medial thickness of > or = 1.3 mm) was 83% in ELSA, while in VHAS, in which plaques were defined as an intimal-medial thickness of > 1.5 mm), the plaque prevalence was 37%. These observations emphasize the importance of evaluating the atherosclerotic action of antihypertensive agents. PLAQUE HYPERTENSION LIPID-LOWERING ITALIAN STUDY (PHYLLIS): This trial is using a factorial design to explore the anti-atherosclerotic action of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (fosinopril) versus a diuretic, and also intends to evaluate the possible benefits of associating antihypertensive therapy with a statin to induce lipid-lowering to prevent the progression of carotid atherosclerosis.
Polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias induced by astemizole overdose have been reported to be successfully managed with intravenous magnesium sulfate. This study was designed to assess the effects of magnesium sulfate on the cardiovascular system, complicating astemizole overdose, the better to understand the therapeutic utility and undesirable effects of magnesium sulfate. Beagle dogs were anesthetized with halothane inhalation (n = 6). Monophasic action potential of the right ventricle, electrocardiogram, and systemic and left ventricular pressure were continuously monitored. Cardiac output was measured by a thermodilution method. Effective refractory period of the right ventricle was assessed by programmed electrical stimulation. An intentionally high dose of astemizole (3 mg/kg, i.v.) prolonged the repolarization and refractory period, while it decreased the sinus automaticity, ventricular contraction, and conduction. A canine antiarrhythmic dose of magnesium sulfate (100 mg/kg, i.v.) was additionally injected 1 h after i.v. astemizole. Magnesium sulfate increased the atrioventricular conduction time, electrical vulnerability, and preload of the left ventricle, while it decreased the blood pressure and cardiac output, besides the effects similar to those observed after i.v. astemizole. The plasma concentration of astemizole was at least 10 times higher than its therapeutic concentration during the experimental period. Magnesium sulfate could be expected to act as a calcium channel blocker during astemizole overdose; however, it may not antagonize the proarrhythmic effects of astemizole.
Concerns have been raised about the adverse impact of Asian dust storms (ADS) on human health; however, few studies have examined the effect of these events on children's health. Using databases from the Taiwan National Health Insurance and Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency, this study investigates the documented daily visits of children to respiratory clinics during and after ADS that occurred from 1997 to 2007 among 12 districts across Taipei City by applying a Bayesian structural additive regressive model controlled for spatial and temporal patterns. This study finds that the significantly impact of elevated children's respiratory clinic visits happened after ADS. Five of the seven lagged days had increasing percentages of relative rate, which was consecutively elevated from a 2-day to a 5-day lag by 0.63%∼2.19% for preschool children (i.e., 0∼6 years of age) and 0.72%∼3.17% for school children (i.e., 7∼14 years of age). The spatial pattern of clinic visits indicated that geographical heterogeneity was possibly associated with the clinic's location and accessibility. Moreover, day-of-week effects were elevated on Monday, Friday, and Saturday. We concluded that ADS may significantly increase the risks of respiratory diseases consecutively in the week after exposure, especially in school children.
The haemodynamic changes induced by acute moderate blood loss were investigated in rats during normotensive halothane anaesthesia and during sodium-nitroprusside-induced hypotensive anaesthesia, respectively. Following haemorrhage in the normotensive group, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and left cardiac work decreased. Cardiac output was reduced non-significantly. Blood flow was redistributed to favour cerebral, coronary, renal and hepatic circulation, mainly at the expense of blood flow to the carcass. Following haemorrhage in the hypotensive group, cardiac output increased significantly. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate and left cardiac work were unchanged. Absolute values for cerebral, coronary, renal and hepatic blood flow were maintained or even increased, while blood flow to the carcass was unchanged.
The effect of CardiPro, a polyherbal formulation, with an antioxidant property, has been studied on doxorubicin (DXR)-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. CardiPro (150 mg/kg b.w., twice daily was administered orally for 7 weeks along with four equal injections (each containing 4.0 mg/kg b.w., DXR) intraperitoneally, once weekly (cumulative dose 16 mg/kg). After a 3-week post DXR treatment period, cardiotoxicity was assessed by noting mortality, volume of ascites, liver congestion, changes in heart weight, myocardial lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes and histology of heart. DXR-treated animals showed higher mortality (50%) and more ascites. Myocardial SOD and glutathione peroxidase activity were decreased and lipid peroxidation was increased. Histology of heart of DXR-treated animals showed loss of myofibrils and focal cytoplasmic vacuolization. CardiPro significantly protected the mice from DXR-induced cardiotoxic effects as evidenced by lower mortality (25%), less ascites, myocardial lipid peroxidation, normalization of antioxidant enzymes and minimal damage to the heart histologically. Our data confirm the earlier reports that DXR cardiotoxicity is associated with the free radical-induced tissue damage. Administration of CardiPro, with an antioxidant property, protected the DXR-induced cardiotoxicity in mice.
