The serial changes in systemic and renal hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balances and various vasoactive hormones were examined in 12 conscious dogs before, during (10 days) the administration of dexamethasone (DEX: 0.5 mg/kg/day) and after the cessation of DEX. In addition, during the administration of DEX, pressor responses to angiotensin II, norepinephrine, an angiotensin II analogue, saralasin, and an alpha-1-blocker, prazosin, were studied. Abrupt elevation of blood pressure to 106 +/- 5 mmHg on Day 1 (vs. 91 +/- 6 mmHg control: P less than 0.05) associated with marked increases in total peripheral resistance (P less than 0.01) was shown in DEX treated animals. Accompanied with these changes, renal blood flow increased to 146 +/- 12 ml/min (vs. 103 +/- 8 ml/min control: P less than 0.05) on Day 1 and maintained. In contrast, the results of serial alterations in hormones could not show any significant changes except significant elevations in atrial natriuretic peptide and reductions of cortisol and arginine vasopressin. Also, marked natriuresis and diuresis were observed in DEX administration dogs. Pressor response to norepinephrine was significantly increased and administration of either saralasin and prazosin significantly reduced the blood pressure of DEX treated animals. These results in DEX-treated conscious dogs confirmed our previous findings in human and rats. Glucocorticoid-induced hypertension mainly depends on the increases in total peripheral resistance but not volume factors.
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene knockout (KO) mice develop hearing loss, as well as hair cell damage in the inner ear. Furthermore, the hearing loss and hair cell damage may be caused and exacerbated by hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. We are therefore seeking an effective treatment to protect the inner ear in ApoE-KO mice. ApoE-KO mice fed with an atherosclerotic diet were treated with simvastatin or with Strauss Heartdrops. The auditory brainstem responses were recorded, and plasma lipid levels and inner ear histology were examined. ApoE-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice fed with a normal chow diet served as controls. Compared to ApoE-KO mice fed only the atherosclerotic diet, ApoE-KO mice treated with simvastatin had no significant hearing loss and less severe atherosclerosis and hair cell damage in the inner ear. However, ApoE-KO mice treated with Strauss Heartdrops developed significant hearing loss and severe atherosclerosis and hair cell damage in the inner ear. These results demonstrate that statins may prevent hearing loss and inner ear damage in ApoE-KO mice by reducing the atherosclerotic lesions and levels of glucose, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride. Statins could be used to treat hearing loss associated with hyperlipidemia.
We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) in 2,031 affected individuals (cases) and 2,044 controls with independent validation in 8,092 cases and 8,620 controls. We identified nine new ESCC susceptibility loci, of which seven, at chromosomes 4q23, 16q12.1, 17q21, 22q12, 3q27, 17p13 and 18p11, had a significant marginal effect (P=1.78×10(-39) to P=2.49×10(-11)) and two of which, at 2q22 and 13q33, had a significant association only in the gene-alcohol drinking interaction (gene-environment interaction P (PG×E)=4.39×10(-11) and PG×E=4.80×10(-8), respectively). Variants at the 4q23 locus, which includes the ADH cluster, each had a significant interaction with alcohol drinking in their association with ESCC risk (PG×E=2.54×10(-7) to PG×E=3.23×10(-2)). We confirmed the known association of the ALDH2 locus on 12q24 to ESCC, and a joint analysis showed that drinkers with both of the ADH1B and ALDH2 risk alleles had a fourfold increased risk for ESCC compared to drinkers without these risk alleles. Our results underscore the direct genetic contribution to ESCC risk, as well as the genetic contribution to ESCC through interaction with alcohol consumption.
Hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone dipropionate Autohaler (HFA-BDP AH) is a breath-actuated chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-free metered dose inhaler in which BDP is in a solution of HFA propellant. Budesonide Turbuhaler (BUD TH) is a breath-dependent dry powder inhaler.
To test the hypothesis that half the daily dose of HFA-BDP AH would provide an equivalent control of asthma symptoms to the BUD TH.
This was an 8-week open study in patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe asthma, previously on BUD 500-1,000 microg x day(-1), or an equivalent. After 5-14 days' run-in, patients were randomized to HFA-BDP AH 800 microg x day(-1) or BUD TH 1,600 microg x day(-1). The intent-to-treat population consisted of 111 patients on HFA-BDP AH and 98 patients on BUD TH.
Mean change from baseline in PEF in the morning (AM PEF) at week 8 was 23.95 liters x min(-1) for HFA-BDP AH and 24.46 liters x min(-1) for BUD TH. A two-sided equivalence test using the 0.51 liter x min(-1) difference gave 95% confidence intervals within a defined equivalence interval of (-infinity, 25 liters x min(-1)) indicating that the mean change in AM PEF was equivalent for the two groups. There were no significant differences in the mean change from baseline in FEV1 or beta-agonist use. Patients using HFA-BDP AH had a significantly greater mean change from baseline in the percentage of days free from shortness of breath (p = 0.05), chest tightness (p = 0.02) and nights without sleep disturbance (p = 0.04) at week 3, and wheeze (p = 0.01), shortness of breath (p = 0.02), chest tightness (p < 0.01) and daily asthma symptoms (p = 0.03) at week 8. The incidence, type and severity of adverse events were similar in each group. At week 8, the mean change from baseline in corrected urine cortisol/creatinine ratio in a subgroup of patients was -0.36 for HFA-BDP and -4.88 for BUD TH (p < 0.01).
HFA-BDP 800 microg x day(-1) provided control of moderate-to-severe asthma with efficacy and safety at least similar to BUD TH 1,600 microg x day(-1).
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis, a key regulator of embryonic growth and development, is exquisitely sensitive to the nutrient status of the animal. In addition to macronutrient deficiencies, zinc deficiency can impact the IGF axis. Gestational zinc deficiency is teratogenic, resulting in intrauterine growth retardation and structural abnormalities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gestational zinc deficiency on the fetal IGF axis in a rat model. From gestation day (GD) 0.5, dams consumed zinc-deficient (ZD, 0.3 mg zinc/kg) or control (25 mg zinc/kg) diet ad libitum, while a third group of dams consumed the control diet in amounts equivalent to the food intake of the ZD dams (Paired group). On GD 19.5 fetal tissue, blood and amniotic fluid were collected. Fetal growth was significantly reduced by zinc deficiency compared with the Paired and Control groups. Fetuses from the Paired group were smaller compared with the Control, but only ZD fetuses had structural malformations. Amniotic fluid IGF-1 concentrations were significantly lower in the Paired group than in the ZD and Control groups. Plasma of ZD fetuses contained lower levels of IGF binding protein-1 when compared with fetuses in the Paired and Control groups. Fetal liver IGF-1 mRNA levels were lower in the ZD fetuses than in the Paired and Control fetuses. These observations suggest that differences in the fetal IGF axis between ZD and Paired groups contribute to the poor pregnancy outcome and enhanced fetal growth retardation observed with zinc deficiency.
In vivo models of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) elucidate important mechanisms of chronic inflammation. Complex intestinal responses to food components create a unique "fingerprint" discriminating health from disease. Five-week-old IL10(-/-) and C57BL/6J (C57; control) mice were inoculated orally with complex intestinal microflora (CIF) and/or pure cultures of Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecalis (EF) aiming for more consistent inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Inoculation treatments were compared to non-inoculated IL10(-/-) and C57 mice, either kept in specific pathogen free (SPF) or conventional conditions (2x5 factorial design). At 12 weeks of age, mice were sacrificed for intestinal histological (HIS) and transcriptomic analysis using limma and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software. Colonic HIS was significantly affected (P<0.05) in inoculated IL10(-/-) mice and accounted for approximately 60% of total intestinal HIS. Inoculation showed a strong effect on colonic gene expression, with more than 2000 genes differentially expressed in EF.CIF-inoculated IL10(-/-) mice. Immune response gene expression was altered (P<0.05) in these mice. The second study investigated the effect of arachidonic (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on colonic HIS and gene expression to test whether EPA, contrary to AA, diminished intestinal inflammation in EF.CIF IL10(-/-) mice (2 x 4 factorial design). AIN-76A (5% corn oil) and AIN-76A (fat-free) +1% corn oil supplemented with either 3.7% oleic acid (OA), AA or EPA were used. IL10(-/-) mice fed EPA- and AA-enriched diets had at least 40% lower colonic HIS (P<0.05) than those fed control diets (AIN-76A and OA diets). The expression of immune response and 'inflammatory disease' genes (down-regulated: TNFalpha, IL6, S100A8, FGF7, PTGS2; up-regulated: PPARalpha, MGLL, MYLK, PPSS23, ABCB4 with EPA and/or AA) was affected in IL10(-/-) mice fed EPA- and AA-enriched diets, compared to those fed AIN-76A diet.
Sera containing antibodies to penicillin and penicillin-related drugs are typically thought to react with drug-coated red blood cells (RBCs) (drug adsorption method), but not when the sera are added to drug and RBCs in the same tube ('immune complex' method). Two cases of immune haemolytic anaemia caused by anti-piperacillin have been previously described. Serological details were given in only one patient. In that subject, the antibody was immunoglobulin (Ig)M + IgG and reacted by both the drug adsorption and 'immune complex' methods.
Two patients with cystic fibrosis developed positive direct antiglobulin tests (DATs) and haemolytic anaemia after 11-12 days of piperacillin therapy. Serological studies were performed with piperacillin, Zosyn (piperacillin + tazobactam) and penicillin by using the drug adsorption and 'immune complex' methods.
The first patient's serum contained an IgG, complement-activating anti-piperacillin that reacted by the 'immune complex' method only. The second patient's IgM + IgG, complement-activating anti-piperacillin reacted by the 'immune complex' method and agglutinated piperacillin-treated RBCs. An eluate from the patient's RBCs reacted weakly with all RBCs tested without the presence of drug. This patient had evidence of intravascular haemolysis and died.
We describe the third and fourth examples of immune haemolytic anaemia caused by anti-piperacillin; one was associated with fatal haemolytic anaemia. As piperacillin is commonly used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, anti-piperacillin should be considered whenever patients with cystic fibrosis develop haemolytic anaemia and/or positive DATs.
The intravenous dipyridamole test is considered a safe procedure with a very low incidence of severe cardiac effects and is routinely used in the diagnosis and prognosis of coronary artery disease. We report the case of a 63-year-old female with negative exercise stress test who developed prolonged and extensive myocardial ischemia after the high-dose intravenous dipyridamole echocardiography test. Aminophylline and nitroglycerin were employed but were ineffective and the patient was successfully treated with systemic thrombolysis. At coronary angiography, 48 hours later, a 50% stenosis in the proximal LAD was documented. We stress that high-dose intravenous dipyridamole can induce a severe ischemic response whose occurrence is unpredictable according to the pre-test clinical features.
Thioridazine, thioridazine side chain sulfoxide, side chain sulfone and ring sulfoxide were each given to two dogs in incremental doses. Profound changes in cardiac output and blood pressure were seen only in the dogs receiving the ring sulfoxide. Although all four drugs increased the QRS and Q-Tc interval, ventricular arrhythmias and "torsades de pointes" were seen only in dogs receiving the ring sulfoxide. Total plasma concentrations of thioridazine ring sulfoxide were in the same range as those seen in some patients on thioridazine therapy although the free concentrations were higher. Thioridazine ring sulfoxide appears to be the most toxic metabolite of thioridazine.
Tenofovir, an antihuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug, has activity against lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants. To describe the efficacy of tenofovir in patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B we applied two investigative approaches based on mathematical models of viral dynamics: the individual nonlinear fitting and the mixed-effect group fitting approaches. Eleven chronic HBV patients on lamivudine for a median of 176 weeks (range: 72-382) with YMDD mutation-related HBV-DNA breakthrough received 'add-on' tenofovir 300 mg once-daily, while maintaining their existing therapy. Sequential sera were taken at day 1 (t = 0 and t = 8 h), days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 and every 4 weeks thereafter, and HBV-DNA levels were assessed using a validated quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Median baseline log HBV-DNA was 8.62 (range: 6.48-9.76 log HBV-DNA). Tenofovir treatment resulted in a mean (+/-SD) log HBV-DNA decline of 1.37 +/- 0.51 in the first phase, 2.54 +/- 0.91 after 4 weeks, and 4.95 +/- 0.90 log HBV-DNA after 24 weeks. The median effectiveness of blocking viral replication in the individual fit model was 93% (range: 73-99) for eta = 0 and 93% (range: 59-99) for eta = 1. There was only a small difference between the efficacy parameter 'epsilon' of the individual nonlinear fitting and mixed-effect group fitting on the biphasic exponential model. These data show that tenofovir has good efficacy in blocking viral replication in HBV patients with lamivudine-induced drug-resistant HBV mutants, but effectiveness varies greatly among individuals. Both models can be used to describe viral decay during tenofovir therapy.
Methylnitrosourea (MNU), an alkylating agent derived from creatinine metabolism, is cytotoxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic. Mid-gestational exposure to MNU leads to distal limb defects in mice. Previous studies have shown that nonspecific maternal immune stimulation protects against MNU-induced teratogenesis. A role for immune-mediated placental improvement in this effect remains uncertain.
The immune system of timed-pregnant C57BL/6N and CD-1 mice was stimulated by GD 7 intraperitoneal (IP) injection with the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). A teratogenic dose of MNU was then administered by IP injection on the morning of GD 9 to disrupt distal limb formation. Fetal limb length, body length, digital deformities, and placental integrity were evaluated on GD 14.
The incidence of syndactyly, polydactyly, and interdigital webbing in MNU-exposed mice was decreased by maternal IFN-gamma treatment. In C57BL/6N mice, these defects were reduced by 47, 100, and 63%, respectively, as compared to previous reports on CD-1 mice, by 39, 71, and 20%, respectively. Administration of IFN-gamma significantly diminished MNU-induced endothelial and trophoblast placental damage in both strains of mice.
These findings support a possible link between maternal immunity, placental integrity, and fetal distal limb development. Further, these results suggest that IFN-gamma might act through placental improvement to indirectly protect against MNU-induced fetal limb malformations.
This study investigated the in vitro antioxidant activity of (E)-2-benzylidene-4-phenyl-1,3-diselenole (BPD), the anticonvulsant effect of BPD on seizures induced by pilocarpine (PC), pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AMP) and the mechanism involved.
BPD antioxidant activity in vitro was investigated using sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and malonate-induced thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and sodium azide-induced reactive species (RS) production. Thiol peroxidase and oxidase as well as δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) activities were examined. Mice were pretreated via oral route (p.o.) with BPD (1-100 mg/kg) before intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of PC (400 mg/kg), PTZ (80 mg/kg) or 4-AMP (12 mg/kg). To investigate the antioxidant effect of BPD on oxidative stress induced by PC, the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) as well as the levels of RS and TBARS were determined in brains of mice. δ-ALA-D, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Na(+), K(+) ATPase activities were verified.
BPD (5 μM) reduced RS production and lipid peroxidation induced by SNP and malonate. BPD (1-50 μM) did not show thiol peroxidase and oxidase activities and did not alter δ-ALA-D activity. BPD (5 mg/kg) increased the latency to the seizure onset on PTZ and 4-AMP models. BPD (100 mg/kg) abolished seizures and death induced by PC in mice. BPD protected against the increase in RS and TBARS levels. The activity of Na(+), K(+) ATPase and AChE inhibited by PC remained unaltered in the BPD group.
BPD showed anticonvulsant and antioxidant effects on seizures induced by PC in mice.
Several animal studies have suggested that calcium channel antagonists may be clinically effective in the treatment of opiate withdrawal. In this study we aimed to examine whether the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine and the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine were equally effective in attenuating the naltrexone-precipitated opiate withdrawal syndrome. We planned to study 16 morphine-dependent in-patients in a double-blind trial. However, the study had to be abandoned after only four patients were entered into it because the first two patients treated with nifedipine became severely confused following naltrexone. The mechanism underlying the development of delirium in these two patients is uncertain, but might possibly relate to a large unopposed release of noradrenaline within the central nervous system. These findings suggest that the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine is not effective in the clinical treatment of opiate withdrawal. Whether other calcium channel antagonists also cause confusion when used in this clinical condition is uncertain at present, but in any future studies investigating their efficacy considerable care is required in their use.
In a double-blind randomised study, we examined if pretreatment with small doses of midazolam, given before anaesthesia induction with fentanyl, influences the occurrence of fentanyl-induced thoracic rigidity (FITR). At the same time, the effect of rigidity on the cardiovascular and respiratory system was assessed. Sixteen patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were divided into two groups. The midazolam group (M) received 0.075 mg/kg midazolam i.v. and the placebo group (P) NaCl 0.9% 3 min before the start of fentanyl induction. During the induction period, FITR was assessed clinically on a 3-point scale. Haemodynamic and respiratory variables were collected before anaesthesia induction, at the end of the fentanyl infusion and 3 min after intubation. The incidence of FITR was high in both groups: 63% in Group M and 75% in Group P (n.s.); however, its severity was less in Group M. The appearance of rigidity affected the cardiovascular and the respiratory system: central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures showed a sharp increase in patients with FITR accompanied by CO2 retention, due to an inability to ventilate these patients adequately. We conclude that small doses of midazolam do not prevent, but may attenuate, FITR and that the appearance of rigidity causes alterations of haemodynamic and respiratory variables during induction.
Death in ventricular fibrillation was induced consistently in desoxycorticosterone acetate-pretreated rats by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol but not by norepinephrine or epinephrine, both of which possess alpha- as well as beta-adrenergic activity. Aminophylline, which enhances beta-adrenergic activity, and phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-receptor blocking agent, were used to study the roles of alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation in the production of ventricular fibrillation. With the addition of aminophylline, both norepinephrine and epinephrine produced death in ventricular fibrillation, and the existing cardiotoxicity of isoproterenol was potentiated. Similarly, in the presence of phenoxylbenzamine, doses of norepinephrine and epinephrine that had been well tolerated became lethal. Internventions that favor beta-adrenergic preponderance, either by enhancing beta-effects or by blocking protective alpha-adrenergic activation, apparently increase the arrhythmogenic propensity of norepinephrine and epinephrine in steroid-pretreated rats. The similarity of some forms of stress to the experimental protocol of chronic steroid treatment followed by acute catecholamine exposure is discussed.
To investigate the etiologies of urinary bladder involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the clinicoradiologic features of gastrointestinal tract manifestations and clinical outcomes in patients with lupus cystitis accompanied by gastrointestinal manifestations.
We conducted a retrospective chart review on 413 patients with SLE. Patients were selected for review on the basis of lower urinary tract symptoms including urinary frequency, urgency and urinary incontinence. Radiologic studies were analyzed in patients with lupus cystitis.
Ten consecutive patients, complicated with lower urinary tract symptoms, were identified. Underlying etiologies were as follows: lupus cystitis in five, neurogenic dysfunction secondary to transverse myelitis in three, cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in one and tuberculous cystitis in one patient. All patients with lupus cystitis showed gastrointestinal manifestations, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea during the periods of cystitis symptoms. In all patients with lupus cystitis, paralytic ileus was demonstrated on plain abdominal X-ray and ascites, bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and thickened bladder wall were identified on abdominal ultrasound or CT. Abdominal CT revealed bowel wall thickening in four of the five patients. The main sites of thickened bowel on abdominal CT were territory supplied by superior mesenteric artery. Two of five patients with lupus cystitis expired during the follow-up period.
Diverse etiologies may cause lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with SLE. Lupus cystitis is strongly associated with gastrointestinal involvement and abdominal CT can be a useful radiologic tool to investigate the gastrointestinal tract involvement in patients with lupus cystitis.
A 1 year double-blind trial of bromperidol decanoate and fluphenazine decanoate was conducted in the maintenance treatment of 47 outpatients with schizophrenia. Six patients relapsed on bromperidol decanoate and none on fluphenazine decanoate, a difference which is statistically significant. No significant differences in positive and negative symptoms, nor depression measures were found between treatment groups when comparisons were made for change in score from entry to last visit. However, patients on fluphenazine decanoate achieved significantly better changes on social disability (Morningside scale) compared to those on bromperidol decanoate. The incidence of extrapyramidal side-effects was similar in both groups, and no statistically significant differences emerged in body weight change between treatments.
We have used the vitamin D analogue, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-23-yne-26,27-hexafluorocholecalcifero l (Ro24-5531), for inhibition of mammary carcinogenesis induced by N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were first treated with a single dose of either 15 or 50 mg/kg body weight NMU and then fed Ro24-5531 (2.5 or 1.25 nmol/kg of diet) for 5-7 months. Ro24-5531 significantly extended tumor latency and lessened tumor incidence as well as tumor number in rats treated with the lower dose of NMU. In rats treated with the higher dose of NMU, Ro24-5531 was fed in combination with tamoxifen; in these experiments, Ro24-5531 significantly enhanced the ability of tamoxifen to reduce total tumor burden, as well as to increase the probability that an animal would be tumor free at the end of the experiment. In vitro, Ro24-5531 was 10-100 times more potent than 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for inhibition of proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines as well as primary cultures of cells from 2 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. When fed chronically, Ro24-5531 did not elevate serum calcium in the present studies. We propose the new term, "deltanoids," for the set of molecules composed of vitamin D and its synthetic analogues, in a manner similar to the naming of "retinoids" for the corresponding set of molecules related to vitamin A.
In vitro, arrhythmias that result from triggered activity based on delayed afterdepolarizations can be reproducibly terminated by pacing. We studied the effect of similar pacing protocols on ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the intact canine heart. The experiments were performed in 17 conscious dogs that had surgically induced atrioventricular block. The pacing protocol included 1, 2, or 20 stimuli and also continuous stimulation during 15, 60, and 120 seconds with interstimulus intervals varying between 500 and 200 msec. A total of 331 stimulation trains were given. The cycle length of the ouabain-induced VT was compared before and after pacing. The mean R-R interval of the induced VT was 380 +/- 80 msec. Termination was only observed in 3% of the pacing experiments and was not reproducible. The common response to pacing was a shortening in cycle length of VT that resulted in R-R intervals of 300 +/- 50 msec (p less than or equal to 0.001). Acceleration was dependent on duration of stimulation. A decrease in the interstimulus interval resulted in shortening of both the first postpacing interval and the cycle length of VT after pacing. These concordant relations were independent of the pacing modes. In conclusion, pacing of ouabain-induced VT in the intact heart rarely results in termination of the arrhythmia. Acceleration of VT is the rule. This finding may be of help in differentiating triggered activity that results from delayed afterdepolarizations from other arrhythmogenic mechanisms.
Colon cancers develop after accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations in colon epithelial cells. To shed light on global changes in gene expression of colon cancers and to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying colon carcinogenesis, we have conducted a comprehensive microarray analysis of mRNA using a rat colon cancer model with the food-borne carcinogen, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). Of 8749 genes or ESTs on a high density oligonucleotide microarray, 27 and 46 were over- and underexpressed, respectively, by > or =3-fold in colon cancers in common in two rat strains with distinct susceptibility to PhIP carcinogenesis. For example, genes involved in inflammation and matrix proteases and a cell cycle regulator gene, cyclin D2, were highly expressed in colon cancers. In contrast, genes encoding structural proteins, muscle-related proteins, matrix-composing and mucin-like proteins were underexpressed. Interestingly, a subset of genes whose expression is characteristic of Paneth cells, i.e. the defensins and matrilysin, were highly overexpressed in colon cancers. The presence of defensin 3 and defensin 5 transcripts in cancer cells could also be confirmed by in situ mRNA hybridization. Furthermore, Alcian blue/periodic acid Schiff base (AB-PAS) staining and immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-lysozyme antibody demonstrated Paneth cells in the cancer tissues. AB-PAS-positive cells were also observed in high grade dysplastic aberrant crypt foci, which are considered to be preneoplastic lesions of the colon. Our results suggest that Paneth cell differentiation in colon epithelial cells could be an early morphological change in cryptic cells during colon carcinogenesis.
Asthma morbidity and mortality has increased. One of the possible causes is the excessive use of beta agonists. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of six week treatment with beclomethasone alone (Ibec) or the combination of beclomethasone-salmeterol (Ibe + Isal) on serum potassium (K), CPK-MB and ECG in children suffering asthma. It was a prospective, randomised, open cross-over trial. Patients received either Ib2 (2 puff/12 hr, 100 micrograms per puff) or Ibe + Isal (B 2 puff/12 hr, 100 micrograms per puff and S 2 puff/12 hr, 25 micrograms per puff) with dose meter inhaler by 6 weeks, with a four-week wash-out period between the treatments. K, CPK-MB and ECG were assessed at baseline, and after each treatment period. There were 9 girls and 20 boys, aged 11 +/- 2.18 (mean +/- SD) years, baseline K was 4.57 +/- 0.43 mEq/l, after B K 4.38 +/- 0.39 IU and after BS K 4.38 +/- 0.40. The CPK-MB level were baseline 14.75 +/- 4.5, after B 20.10 +/- 6.9 and after BS 21 +/- 8.05 (p < 0.05). Baseline QTc was 0.416 +/- 0.02 msec, after B 0.425 +/- 0.027, and after BS 0.415 +/- 0.029. We conclude that the treatment of children with asthma with 400 micrograms per day of Ibec or concomitantly with 100 micrograms of Isal for 6 weeks does not alter the serum K+ or the QTc. However, the CPK-MB has a significant increment with both treatments but without clinical and/or ECG changes. We can't affirm that Ibec or Ibec plus Isal have a cardiotoxic side-effect by the only presence of high levels of CPK-MB. We agree that it is necessary a close follow up of these apparently asymptomatic patients not induce important cardiovascular changes although CPK-MB was increased.
Cholelithiasis has been reported to occur rarely in infants. To determine the incidence of cholelithiasis in infants receiving furosemide, we prospectively performed ultrasonograms on 86 patients. We studied 42 patients receiving furosemide (subjects) and 44 patients not receiving furosemide (controls). There was a significantly higher incidence of gallstones in subjects (21%) than in controls (2%) (P less than .05). When followed over 1 year, the gallstones did not resolve. There were no significant differences in the dosage of furosemide, gestational age, placement of umbilical venous catheters, or amount of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) between subjects with and without gallstones. However, subjects received more days of TPN (16.7 +/- 15.1) than controls (8.4 +/- 13.2) (P less than .05). These data show that the incidence of cholelithiasis is higher than previously suspected in infants receiving furosemide. Thus, furosemide, either independently or in conjunction with the use of TPN, predisposes infants to the development of cholelithiasis.
Intrauterine growth retardation programs the fetus to manipulated metabolic changes that lead to adult diseases. Considering that chromium (Cr) supplements influence lean body mass (LBM) in both humans and experimental animals, we have studied the effect of maternal Cr restriction on muscle development and function in the rat offspring. Female weanling Wistar/NIN rats received, for 12 weeks, a control or 65% Cr-restricted diet ad libitum and mated with control males. While control mothers/offspring received control diet throughout (CrC), some restricted mothers were switched to control diet from conception (CrRC) and parturition (CrRP) and their offspring were weaned on to control diet. Half of the remaining restricted pups were weaned on to control diet (CrRW) and the other half continued on restricted diet throughout (CrR). Maternal CrR significantly decreased the percent of LBM (LBM %) and fat-free mass (FFM %) in the offspring and this was associated with decreased expression of the myogenic genes: MyoD, Myf5 and MyoG. Surprisingly, expression of the muscle atrophy genes, Atrogin and MuRF 1, was also decreased in CrR offspring. Although basal glucose uptake by muscle was higher in CrR than in CrC offspring, the stimulation with insulin was comparable, implying no change in its insulin sensitivity. Rehabilitation partly corrected myogenic and atrophic gene expression but had no effect on LBM % or FFM % or glucose uptake by muscle. The results show that maternal Cr restriction in rats may irreversibly impair muscle development and glucose uptake by muscle. Modulation of muscle atrophy appears to be an adaptive mechanism to preserve muscle mass in CrR offspring.
The importance of brain noradrenaline synthesis and receptor activation for the hyperkinesia induced by carbidopa plus L-Dopa in reserpine-treated or normal mice was analyzed in four different models. After pretreatment with reserpine and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor nialamide, the hyperkinesia induced by L-Dopa (25 mg/kg i.p.) was partly mediated via stimulation of noradrenaline receptors since it was significantly antagonized by the noradrenaline receptor-blocking agent phenoxybenzamine. Treatment with reserpine plus L-Dopa (125 mg/kg i.p.) produced an increase in motor activity probably due to stimulation of dopamine receptors since it was not accompanied by an accumulation of noradrenaline and it was not inhibited by phenoxybenzamine. The hyperkinesia following treatment with reserpine and a higher dose of L-Dopa (250 mg/kg i.p.) was probably due to stimulation of both dopamine and noradrenaline receptors since the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor FLA-63 partly reduced the effect of L-Dopa. Phenoxybenzamine potentiated the motor stimulation by L-Dopa (125 mg/kg i.p.) in mice not pretreated with reserpine, perhaps depending on a slight enhancement of the net accumulation of brain dopamine. Thus, noradrenaline receptor activation is of importance for the L-Dopa-induced hyperkinesia, at least after high doses or after monoamine oxidase inhibition.
