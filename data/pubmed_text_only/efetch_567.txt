Acquired resistance of cancer cells to anticancer drugs or ionizing radiation (IR) is one of the major obstacles in cancer treatment. Pancreatic cancer is an exceptional aggressive cancer, and acquired drug resistance in this cancer is common. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an essential role in cell apoptosis, which is a key mechanism by which radio- or chemotherapy induce cell killing. Mitochondria are the major source of ROS in cells. Thus, alterations in the expression of mitochondrial proteins, involved in ROS production or scavenging, may be closely linked to the resistance of cancer cells to radio- or chemotherapy. In the present study, we generated a stable cell line by exposing pancreatic cancer cells to increasing concentrations of ROS-inducing, anticancer compound 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) over a 3-month period. The resulting cell line showed strong resistance to 2-ME and contained an elevated level of ROS. We then used a comparative proteomics method to profile the differential expression of mitochondrial proteins between the parental and the resistant cells. One protein identified to be upregulated in the resistant cells was manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), a mitochondrial protein that converts superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxides. Silencing of SOD2 resensitized the resistant cells to 2-ME, and overexpression of SOD2 led the parental cells to 2-ME resistance. In addition, the 2-ME-resistant cells also showed resistance to IR. Our results suggest that upregulation of SOD2 expression is an important mechanism by which pancreatic cancer cells acquire resistance to ROS-inducing, anticancer drugs, and potentially also to IR.
Acute lung injury following envenomation by Tityus scorpion species is due in part to activation of the inflammatory response leading to release of cytotoxic leukocyte-derived products, including cytokines and possibly reactive oxygen species (ROS). Tityus zulianus envenomation in Venezuela produces cardiorespiratory complications and death by lung injury whereas stings by Tityus discrepans produce mainly gastrointestinal and pancreatic alterations. To ascertain the role played by granulocytes in the envenomation by T. zulianus (TzV) and T. discrepans (TdV), human peripheral blood neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes were exposed to scorpion venoms (0.001-5 μg/mL) and the kinetics (5-15 min) of peroxide production determined by flow cytometry, using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (succinimidyl ester) as a fluorescent substrate. TzV induced a significantly (p<0.01) more potent increase in peroxide production in neutrophils (for 5 and 10 min of incubation), and to a lesser extent in monocytes (5-15 min), compared to TdV. TzV induced necrosis in neutrophils at doses higher than 5 μg/mL. No effect was observed on eosinophils, suggesting that TzV specifically targets neutrophil intracellular ROS production. The TzV-stimulated pathway is protein kinase C-dependent because it was almost completely (>90%) abolished by staurosporine. The stimulatory effect is associated with the lowest molecular mass venom peptides as gel filtration fractions TzII and TzIII significantly enhanced peroxide production. The combined used of the intracellular ROS agonist, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and TzV produced a modest but significant increase in peroxide production suggesting the possibility of overlapping signaling cascades amongst PMA and TzV. Up-regulation of intracellular neutrophil ROS production may be an important in vivo target for TzV which could have a role to play in the cardiorespiratory complications elicited after envenomation by this species.
Dispositions for genes encoding opioid receptors may explain some variability in morphine efficacy. Experimental studies show that morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are less effective in individuals carrying variant alleles caused by the 118 A > G polymorphism in the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1). The purpose of the study was to investigate whether this and other genetic polymorphisms in OPRM1 influence the efficacy of morphine in cancer pain patients.
We screened 207 cancer pain patients on oral morphine treatment for four frequent OPRM1 gene polymorphisms. The polymorphisms were the -172 G > T polymorphism in the 5'untranslated region of exon 1, the 118 A > G polymorphism in exon 1, and the IVS2 + 31 G > A and IVS2 + 691 G > C polymorphisms, both in intron 2. Ninety-nine patients with adequately controlled pain were included in an analysis comparing morphine doses and serum concentrations of morphine and morphine metabolites in the different genotypes for the OPRM1 polymorphisms.
No differences related to the -172 G > T, the IVS2 + 31 G > A and the IVS2 + 691 G > C polymorphisms were observed. Patients homozygous for the variant G allele of the 118 A > G polymorphism (n = 4) needed more morphine to achieve pain control, compared to heterozygous (n = 17) and homozygous wild-type (n = 78) individuals. This difference was not explained by other factors such as duration of morphine treatment, performance status, time since diagnosis, time until death, or adverse symptoms.
Patients homozygous for the 118 G allele of the mu-opioid receptor need higher morphine doses to achieve pain control. Thus, genetic variation at the gene encoding the mu-opioid receptor contributes to variability in patients' responses to morphine.
Tobacco smoke is an important risk factor for various human cancers, including esophageal cancer. How benzo [a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), a carcinogen present in tobacco smoke as well as in environmental pollution, induces esophageal carcinogenesis has yet to be defined. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism responsible for BPDE-suppressed expression of retinoic acid receptor-beta2 (RAR-beta2) in esophageal cancer cells. We treated esophageal cancer cells with BPDE before performing methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) to find that BPDE induced methylation of the RAR-beta2 gene promoter. We then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to find that BPDE recruited genes of the methylation machinery into the RAR-beta2 gene promoter. We found that BPDE recruited DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A), but not beta (DNMT3B), in a time-dependent manner to methylate the RAR-beta2 gene promoter, which we confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the reduced RAR-beta2 expression in these BPDE-treated esophageal cancer cell lines. However, BPDE did not significantly change DNMT3A expression, but it slightly reduced DNMT3B expression. DNA methylase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) and DNMT3A small hairpin RNA (shRNA) vector antagonized the effects of BPDE on RAR-beta2 expressions. Transient transfection of the DNMT3A shRNA vector also antagonized BPDE's effects on expression of RAR-beta2, c-Jun, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), suggesting a possible therapeutic effect. The results of this study form the link between the esophageal cancer risk factor BPDE and the reduced RAR-beta2 expression.
Male Japanese white rabbits were injected subcutaneously with methyl iodide (57 mg/kg body weight/day) on two successive days and their lipid metabolism was investigated 48 hr after the last injection. The plasma triglyceride levels increased from the preinjection average of 56.1 mg/dl to 246.0 mg/dl on an average, the individual values being greatly variable. Analysis of lipoprotein profile of plasma showed a significant increase of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Lipolytic activities in postheparin plasma did not change. However, rates of triglyceride secretion into plasma, measured by Triton WR 1339 injection method, were significantly higher in the animals treated with methyl iodide than in the controls. Histological investigation of the liver showed diffuse fat deposits in the hepatocytes without any destructive and inflammatory changes. The results indicate that hyperlipidemia and fatty liver of rabbits induced by methyl iodide is related to the elevation of triglyceride synthesis and its secretion in the liver.
In a hitherto unconfirmed report, orosomucoid was reported to ameliorate the nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) in rats.
We wanted to test this hypothesis and extend the analysis of the effects on the glomerular barrier. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and fractional clearance for albumin (theta(albumin)) and for neutral Ficolls were estimated in cooled isolated perfused kidneys. Modern transport equations were used to estimate glomerular size selectivity and charge selectivity. Also, podocyte morphology was studied. Four groups of rats (4 x n = 8) were administered PAN intraperitoneally and treated daily for 5 days with orosomucoid in two different doses (groups A and B), albumin (group C) or saline (group D). Two additional groups of rats (2 x n = 8) were used as controls and these rats received either saline (group E) or orosomucoid (group F) but no PAN.
Treatment with orosomucoid restored podocyte morphology and renal function from the damaging effects of PAN in a dose-dependent manner. GFR was significantly reduced by PAN (groups C and D) when compared with controls (groups E and F). This effect was partly (group A) or completely (group B) reversed by orosomucoid. The theta(albumin) was 0.002+/-0.001 (mean+/-SEM) in controls (group E) and was unaffected by orosomucoid per se (group F). PAN increased theta(albumin) to 0.020+/-0.001 in group C and to 0.021+/-0.001 in group D, while it was significantly less in group A, 0.014+/-0.001, P<0.05. The heterogeneous charged fibre model analysis revealed that PAN reduced the relative volume of negatively charged fibres, phi, from 7.1+/-0.08% (group E) to 48% of this value in groups C and D (P<0.001); phi was 4.5+/-0.04% in group A, 5.3+/-0.44% in group B, and 6.1+/-0.11% in group F.
High doses of orosomucoid completely normalized the glomerular barrier in six out of eight animals with puromycin-induced nephrotic syndrome. Thus, orosomucoid has a promising therapeutic potential for certain kidney disorders.
Several lines of evidence suggest that increased neuraminidase activity may be responsible for the loss of glomerular N-acetylneuraminic acid (AcNeu) observed in various glomerular diseases. However, virtually no information is available on the activity of neuraminidase in glomeruli or the potential role of this enzyme in glomerular pathophysiology. Utilizing 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4MU-AcNeu) as substrate, we defined optimal assay conditions and characterized neuraminidase activity in glomeruli and, for comparison, in other renal fractions and liver. Neuraminidase activity in glomeruli, cortex and tubules was maximal at pH 4.4. The Km for 4MU-AcNeu was estimated to be 195 microM for glomeruli and 226 microM for cortex. Glomerular neuraminidase was inhibited by AcNeu (90% at 25 mM) and high concentrations of Triton X-100 (26% at 0.5%), but unaffected by CaCl2, EDTA or N-ethylmaleimide (each 1 mM). Neuraminidase activity (nmol/h per mg of protein; mean +/- S.E.M.) in normal rat kidney was: cortex, 14.47 +/- 0.76; medulla, 7.85 +/- 0.64; papilla, 2.64 +/- 0.11; tubules, 13.79 +/- 0.70; glomeruli, 5.57 +/- 0.28. In comparison, neuraminidase activity in rat liver was 2.58 +/- 0.14. Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrotic syndrome is a model of glomerular disease in which the loss of glomerular AcNeu is well documented. In two separate studies, we observed no change in the specific activity of neuraminidase in either glomeruli or cortex isolated from rats treated with PAN (15 mg/100 g, intraperitoneally) and killed at either the onset or the peak of proteinuria. Results were similar whether neuraminidase activity was expressed per mg of protein or per microgram of DNA.
A 22-year-old woman was given trimethoprim plus sulphamethoxazole for a urinary infection (160 and 800 mg, respectively, daily), drugs she had not previously taken. After 2 weeks she noticed a rash of small spots on her trunk. In addition she had nausea and vomiting. The rash faded within 2 days of stopping the drug, but progressive jaundice developed.
SGPT and SGOT concentrations rose to maximally 328 and 83 U/l, total bilirubin to maximally 5.9 mg/dl. There was no evidence for viral hepatitis (B or C, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr), autoimmune hepatitis or primary biliary hepatitis. Liver biopsy showed central acinar cholestasis, which suggested drug-induced liver damage.
The patient's symptoms regressed over several weeks without any specific treatment and 8 weeks after onset of the rash the laboratory tests also became normal. The allergic cause of the cholestatic hepatitis was confirmed by a lymphocyte transformation test.
Clinical suspicion of drug allergy as cause of a cholestatic hepatitis can be confirmed reliably and without any risk to the patient with the lymphocyte transformation test.
The possible uroprotective effects of curcumin have been addressed in the current study. Haemorrhagic cystitis was induced by challenging male Swiss albino rats with a single dose of cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg, i.p.). Curcumin (200 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered for 10 consecutive days followed by a single dose of cyclophosphamide. Haemorrhagic cystitis was well characterized morphologically and biochemically. The hallmark of this toxicity was marked congestion, oedema and extravasation in rat urinary bladder, as well as a marked desquamative damage to the urothelium and severe inflammation in the lamina propria. Leucocytic infiltration was also observed and determined by histopathological examination. Serum level of tumour necrosis factor-alpha was notably elevated associated with apparent hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia. Bladder contents of adenosine triphosphate, reduced glutathione and glutathione-S-transferase activity were markedly reduced. Malondialdehyde level, myeloperoxidase activity and urinary nitrite-nitrate levels, expressed as nitric oxide, were dramatically increased. Prior administration of curcumin ahead of cyclophosphamide challenge improved all the biochemical and histologic alterations induced by the cytotoxic drug. Based on these broad findings, it could be concluded that curcumin has proven uroprotective efficacy in this cyclophosphamide haemorrhagic cystitis model, possibly through modulating the release of inflammatory endocoids, namely tumour necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide, improving the energy status and restoring the oxidant/antioxidant balance.
In 736 patients, 24 hour electrocardiographic recordings were performed 14 to 36 days after acute myocardial infarction before the start of randomized treatment with 320 mg of slow release oxprenolol (n = 358) or placebo (n = 378). Follow-up 24 hour electrocardiographic recordings were obtained 5 to 12 days (median 10) and 3, 6 and 12 months after the first administration of the study medication. Oxprenolol-treated patients had a significantly lower daytime heart rate as compared with the placebo group, whereas no difference was found at night. At baseline, 22.1% of the patients allocated to oxprenolol treatment and 29.6% of the placebo group had more than 30 ventricular extrasystoles in 1 hour at least once during 24 hour monitoring; multiform ventricular extrasystoles were present in 58.4 and 62.7%, ventricular couplets in 29.6 and 33.9% and ventricular tachycardia (3 or more consecutive ventricular extrasystoles) in 21.5 and 20.9% of the oxprenolol-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. During the 1 year follow-up period, the prevalence of these arrhythmias did not change significantly in either treatment group. There was a trend toward a reduction in the daytime frequency of ventricular couplets in the oxprenolol group. After 3 and 6 months, only multiform ventricular extrasystoles were significantly less frequent in the oxprenolol group than in the placebo group (47.4 and 42.7% versus 59.7 and 57.9%, respectively). Twelve months after the acute event, however, multiform ventricular extrasystole frequency was the same in both groups of patients (52.1 versus 51.0%, respectively). Thus, oxprenolol had a weak suppressant effect on ventricular tachyarrhythmias in survivors of myocardial infarction.
The therapeutic use of adriamycin (doxorubicin), a potent antitumor antibiotic, is limited by the development of dose-dependent cardiomyopathy. Increased oxidative stress due to adriamycin is considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of this toxic effect. In this study, we examined the levels and redistribution of vitamin A (a potent non-enzymatic antioxidant) in adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats. Three weeks after the adriamycin (ADR) treatment, animals were hemodynamically assessed and different tissues were analyzed for total retinol (vitamin A), (3)H-radio-labeled retinol, retinol palmitate and vitamin E. At 3 weeks, animals in the ADR group were hemodynamically and clinically confirmed to be in heart failure. In the ADR group, total retinol levels in heart and plasma were unchanged. However, levels of the (3)H radio-labeled fraction of retinol were significantly increased in both organs suggesting increased turnover. In the liver, the levels of total retinol and retinol palmitate were significantly decreased, while the radio-labeled fraction of retinol was significantly increased suggesting mobilization of retinol from this organ. Alpha tocopherol (vitamin E) levels were found unchanged in hearts of the ADR animals, while its levels in the plasma and liver were significantly increased. Increased radio-labeled fraction, without any change in the total retinol in the heart, suggested that vitamin A is utilized more by the heart under increased oxidative stress due to adriamycin. Its levels in the plasma and the heart may have been maintained at the expense of the loss from the liver.
The limitations of current treatments for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) have led to the investigation of localised, non-systemic alternatives. NGX-4010, a high-concentration (8%) capsaicin dermal patch, was developed to treat patients with neuropathic pain. We report the results of a randomised, double blind, 12-week study of the efficacy and safety of one application of NGX-4010 in patients with PHN.
In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group trial, 402 patients were randomly assigned to one 60-min application of NGX-4010 (640 microg/cm(2) [8% capsaicin]) or a low-concentration capsaicin control patch (3.2 microg/cm(2) [0.04% capsaicin]). Patients were aged 18-90 years, had had postherpetic neuralgia for at least 6 months, and had an average baseline numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) score of 3 to 9. The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change in NPRS score from baseline to weeks two to eight. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00115310.
Patients who were randomly assigned to NGX-4010 (n=206) had a significantly greater reduction in pain during weeks two to eight than did patients who had the control patch (n=196). The mean changes in NPRS score were -29.6%vs -19.9% (difference -9.7%, 95% CI -15.47 to -3.95; p=0.001). 87 (42%) patients who received NGX-4010 and 63 (32%) controls had a 30% or greater reduction in mean NPRS score (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.37; p=0.03). The patients who had NGX-4010 had significant improvements in pain during weeks two to 12 (mean change in NPRS score -29.9%vs -20.4%, difference -9.5, -15.39 to -3.61; p=0.002). Transient blood pressure changes associated with changes in pain level were recorded on the day of treatment, and short-lasting erythema and pain at the site of application were common, self-limited, and generally mild to moderate in the NGX-4010 group and less frequent and severe in the controls.
One 60-min application of NGX-4010 provided rapid and sustained pain relief in patients with postherpetic neuralgia. No adverse events were associated with treatment except for local reactions at the site of application and those related to treatment-associated pain.
A child with facial and digital anomalies and mental retardation after exposure to phenobarbitone during gestation is presented. The teratogenicity of anticonvulsants, including phenobarbitone, is discussed, and guidelines for anticonvulsant therapy during pregnancy are suggested.
The authors report the observation of one patient in whom the first administration of chemotherapy with fluoro-5 uracil has induced a severe but reversible cardiogenic shock. The latter was preceded by a prolonged, constrictive thoracic pain without myocardial infarction constitution. The cardiac toxicity of fluoro-5 uracil has been well described in the form of anginal pains receding with the discontinuation of the treatment. However, the possible occurrence of arrhythmias, of collapse and even sudden deaths leads the authors to suggest the daily clinical and electrical observation of the patients treated with fluoro-5 uractil.
Tolerability and efficacy of the new uroprotective agent ARGIMESNA was assessed within a randomized cross-over study comparing it to sodiummercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA), in patients treated with IFO. MESNA i.v., 20% of IFO dose, was given to all patients before chemotherapy; 4 h later, at random, they received ARGIMESNA p.o., 20% of IFO dose every 2 h x 4, or MESNA p.o., 40% of IFO dose every 4 h x 2. Overall, 78 cycles of oral uroprotection were administered: 37 for ARGIMESNA capsules; 41 for MESNA vials p.o. ARGIMESNA was subjectively better tolerated, determining gastro-intestinal discomfort in only 12 out of 37 cycles versus 34/41 of MESNA p.o. (p less than 0.001). Both preparations were equivalent for subjective and objective efficacy since no cycles were complicated by urinary symptoms (dysuria, stranguria, or hematuria). Nevertheless, 2 patients (7.7%) refused further oral assumption of both uroprotectors, whereas MESNA i.v. was added in other 7 patients because of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. In conclusion, this new oral preparation of mercaptoethanesulfonate turned out to be well tolerated, safe and active in the prevention of haemorrhagic cystitis from IFO.
To explore the dose-response relationship in patients with pulmonary hypertension after inhalation of nitric oxide (NO).
The effect of various concentrations (20, 40, 60 and 80 ppm) of NO on hemodynamics and cardiac function in 16 patients with pulmonary hypertension was studied with right heart catheterization.
Pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance reduced significantly after inhalation of various concentrations (20, 40, 60 and 80 ppm) of NO. The vascular response to NO was not concentration-dependant with a maximal effect obtained at 20 ppm. At inhalation of low dose of NO (20 ppm), the mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance dropped by 26.5% and 40.3% (P < 0.0001), respectively. With the increase of inhaled NO concentration, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance did not decline.
The best concentration of inhaled NO was not more than 20 ppm in the patients of this study.
The acute effects of aspirin on auditory functions were examined electrophysiologically in conscious rats with chronically implanted electrodes for auditory brainstem response (ABR) recording. A single intravenous injection of aspirin at a dose of 225 mg/kg caused a reduction in the amplitude of the ABR P1 wave evoked by a 2 kHz tone pip 1 and 24 hr after dosing at almost all sound intensity levels, while the P1 amplitude at 4 kHz was reduced mainly 1 hr after dosing, and the P1 amplitude at 8 kHz was not significantly affected at middle and high intensities even 1 hr after dosing. The audiogram obtained from the P1 amplitude showed a significant increase in the sound threshold 1 and 24 hr after dosing at 2 kHz, and 1 hr after dosing at 4 kHz, but not at 8 kHz. The peak latency of the P1 wave was also prolonged. Furthermore, reduction of the P2 and P4 wave amplitude and prolongation of the P1-P2 and P2-P4 interpeak latency were also observed at 2 kHz but not a 4 or 8 kHz. These results suggest that the rat auditory function for low frequency is vulnerable to the effects of aspirin. This paradigm, i.e., frequency selectivity, n rats may be useful to further assess the different outer hair cells along the cochlear duct and provide additional evidence for the mechanism(s) or site underlying aspirin ototoxicity.
Accidental hydrofluoric acid (HF) splashes often occur in industrial settings. HF easily penetrates into tissues by initial acid action allowing fluoride ions to penetrate deeply, chelating calcium and magnesium. Resultant hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia can be fatal. This report describes the utilization of Hexafluorine--a hypertonic, amphoteric, chelating decontamination solution--in workplaces where water decontamination followed by calcium gluconate inunction failed to prevent HF burns and systemic toxicity. Between 1998 and 1999, 16 cases of ocular and dermal HF splashes with either 70% HF or 6% HF/15% nitric acid (HNO3) were decontaminated with Hexafluorine at the worksite. HF burns did not develop and medical treatment other than initial decontamination was not reQuired in 12/16 (75%). In 7/16 (44%) cases, lost work time corresponded to duration of hospital observation (mean < 1 d).
Blood pressure and heart rate were measured by telemetry in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) to investigate the contribution of angiotensin II to the reflex tachycardia resulting from exaggerated hypotension caused by a high dose of a calcium channel blocker. Pre-treatment with TCV-116, an angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist, or enalapril partially attenuated the reflex tachycardia induced by manidipine, but TCV-116 had almost no effect on the sinus tachycardia induced by isoproterenol. The suppressive effects of TCV-116 against the reflex tachycardia tended to be more obvious in WKY than in SHR, though the difference was not statistically significant. Concurrent administration of propranolol almost completely inhibited both the reflex tachycardia and the sinus tachycardia in SHR and WKY, indicating that the sympathetic nervous system contributes to both types of tachycardia. We demonstrated that angiotensin II may be involved in the reflex tachycardia induced by calcium channel blockers probably via activation of some component of the sympathetic nervous system other than postsynaptic factors at the sinus node.
A 20-year-old woman given a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism (Basedow's disease) had been subsequently treated with methimazole since 1999. As she could not be made euthyroid, surgery was planned to relieve the symptoms. Because of liver dysfunction after discontinuation of methimazole and administration of iodine, she was admitted to the hospital. She was negative for hepatitis A, B and C virus serologies, but positive for anti-nuclear antibodies. A liver biopsy, which showed features of chronic active hepatitis, led to the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Interestingly, normalization of serum T4 correlated with improvement of serum aminotransferases. This leads us to speculate that this patient's liver dysfunction may have been AIH exacerbated by the liver dysfunction of hyperthyroidism rather than acute deterioration of AIH itself.
Zonisamide (ZNS) is a generally well tolerated anticonvulsant that has beneficial effects on Parkinson's disease (PD). ZNS (300 mg/day) given to a patient with PD who incidentally had convulsive attacks, ameliorated the attacks and, surprisingly, his parkinsonian symptoms. We, therefore, carried out an open trial of ZNS on nine patients with PD. Patients were given 50-200 mg/day ZNS in addition to their anti-PD drugs. Seven clearly showed lessening of symptoms, especially wearing-off. We speculate that long lasting activation of dopamine synthesis by ZNS ameliorates parkinsonian symptoms, in particular wearing-off.
Ascorbic acid (AA) metabolism in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats was determined by examining urinary excretion, renal reabsorption, reductive regeneration, and biosynthesis of AA at 3 and 14 days after STZ administration. AA concentrations in the plasma, liver, and kidney of the diabetic rats were significantly lower than those of controls on d 3, and decreased further as the diabetic state continued. Hepatic AA regeneration significantly decreased in the diabetic rats on d 3 in spite of increased gene expressions of AA regenerating enzymes and was further reduced on d 14. Hepatic activity of L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, a terminal enzyme of hepatic AA biosynthesis, also decreased significantly on d 3 and decreased further on d 14. Urinary excretion of AA was significantly increased on d 3, with an increase in urine volume but no change in gene expressions of renal AA transporters (SVCT1 and SVCT2). Urinary excretion of AA was normalized on d 14. The results suggest that impaired hepatic and renal regeneration, as well as increased urinary excretion and impaired hepatic biosynthesis of AA, contributed to the decrease in AA in plasma and tissues of STZ-induced diabetic rats.
Twelve patients with liver disease related to methyldopa were seen between 1967 and 1977. Illness occurred within 1--9 weeks of commencement of therapy in 9 patients, the remaining 3 patients having received the drug for 13 months, 15 months and 7 years before experiencing symptoms. Jaundice with tender hepatomegaly, usually preceded by symptoms of malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and associated with upper abdominal pain, was an invariable finding in all patients. Biochemical liver function tests indicated hepatocellular necrosis and correlated with histopathological evidence of hepatic injury, the spectrum of which ranged from fatty change and focal hepatocellular necrosis to massive hepatic necrosis. Most patients showed moderate to severe acute hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis with associated cholestasis. The drug was withdrawn on presentation to hospital in 11 patients, with rapid clinical improvement in 9. One patient died, having presented in hepatic failure, and another, who had been taking methyldopa for 7 years, showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months. The remaining patient in the series developed fulminant hepatitis when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of methyldopa-induced hepatitis. In this latter patient, and in 2 others, the causal relationship between methyldopa and hepatic dysfunction was proved with the recurrence of hepatitis within 2 weeks of re-exposure to the drug.
Elevation of the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the brain is associated with a reduction of food intake and body weight gain in normal and obese animals. A protein that binds CRF and the related peptide, urocortin, with high affinity, CRF-binding protein (CRF-BP), may play a role in energy homeostasis by inactivating members of this peptide family in ingestive and metabolic regulatory brain regions. Intracerebroventricular administration in rats of the high-affinity CRF-BP ligand inhibitor, rat/human CRF (6-33), which dissociates CRF or urocortin from CRF-BP and increases endogenous brain levels of "free" CRF or urocortin significantly blunted exaggerated weight gain in Zucker obese subjects and in animals withdrawn from chronic nicotine. Chronic administration of CRF suppressed weight gain nonselectively by 60% in both Zucker obese and lean control rats, whereas CRF-BP ligand inhibitor treatment significantly reduced weight gain in obese subjects, without altering weight gain in lean control subjects. Nicotine abstinent subjects, but not nicotine-naive controls, experienced a 35% appetite suppression and a 25% weight gain reduction following acute and chronic administration, respectively, of CRF-BP ligand inhibitor. In marked contrast to the effects of a CRF-receptor agonist, the CRF-BP ligand inhibitor did not stimulate adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion or elevate heart rate and blood pressure. These results provide support for the hypothesis that the CRF-BP may function within the brain to limit selected actions of CRF and/or urocortin. Furthermore, CRF-BP may represent a novel and functionally selective target for the symptomatic treatment of excessive weight gain associated with obesity of multiple etiology.
We conducted a randomized prospective trial in 19 disease-free soft tissue sarcoma patients with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy identified by ECG radionuclide angiography at rest and during exercise to determine the efficacy of the free radical scavenger, N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC), in reversing the drug's cardiotoxic effect. Of the 19 patients, 11 received oral NAC (5.5 gm/m2 daily for 30 days) and eight patients served as controls. Patients were stratified for age less than greater than 45 years, time from final dose of doxorubicin to randomization less than greater than 8 months, and history of treatment with mediastinal irradiation. The two groups were well-matched for all parameters. Cumulative mean doxorubicin dose (523 mg/m2 and 532 mg/m2) and range 500-600 mg/m2 was comparable. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction before randomization was not significantly different between the two groups either at rest (39 +/- 10% control, 38 +/- 13% NAC) or during exercise (38 +/- 12% control, 35 +/- 11% NAC). Neither rest nor exercise ejection fraction values changed significantly in either group between prerandomization and 1-month postrandomization studies. Late studies performed in seven NAC patients 3-5 months after randomization revealed no difference in LV ejection fraction compared to 1-month postrandomization values. Clinical course in patients with overt congestive heart failure was similar in both groups. LV function did not return to normal in any patient in either group. We conclude that N-Acetyl Cysteine has no effect in reversing long standing doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Defects in the human Ca(2+)-sensing receptor gene have recently been shown to cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism. We now demonstrate that a missense mutation (Glu128Ala) in this gene causes familial hypocalcaemia in affected members of one family. Xenopus oocytes expressing the mutant receptor exhibit a larger increase in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate in response to Ca2+ than oocytes expressing the wild-type receptor. We conclude that this extracellular domain mutation increases the receptor's activity at low Ca2+ concentrations, causing hypocalcaemia in patients heterozygous for such a mutation.
