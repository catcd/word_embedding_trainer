BALB/c mice with an acute or chronic Leishmania donovani infection were treated with intravenous sodium stibogluconate solution and the parasite suppressions determined in the spleen, liver and femur bone marrow. Antimony concentrations in these and other tissues were determined by hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrophotometry. There was little correlation between tissue antimony levels one hour after treatment and drug efficacy. It would appear that the peak tissue antimony concentration achieved soon after dosing, rather than the lower concentrations which are readily sustained in most tissues, is the most important factor in the antileishmanial activity of stibogluconate. A high peak antimony concentration occurred in the liver, where parasites were significantly suppressed, and was not observed in the two other sites of infection, where the parasites were apparently less susceptible to stibogluconate therapy.
The antihypertensive effect and possible adverse effects of verapamil were assessed in 30 Thai patients with mild to moderate hypertension. All patients had normal blood chemistry evaluations and electrocardiograms. After a 4-week placebo period, 80 mg of verapamil was given 2 times a day for 8 weeks. Blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded both in supine and standing positions every 2 weeks. Verapamil decreased blood pressure significantly both in supine and standing positions. The pulse rate was not significantly affected. The most common adverse effect was constipation. No vivid dreams or breathlessness were reported. The blood chemistry and electrocardiograms at the end of the study period were not significantly changed. It is concluded that verapamil reduces blood pressure in mild to moderate hypertensive Thai patients.
A clinical trial in 24 patients with essential arterial hypertension (14 women and 10 men, mean age 47.5) was conducted on a double-blind basis using a placebo, 240-mg verapamil and 100-mg atenolol daily. The total duration of the trial was 12 weeks: a 2-week washout period on placebo, a 4-week period on one of the trial drugs, a second 2-week weaning period and a further 4-week treatment period on the other trial drug. Stabilization of the hypertension was obtained in 80% of the patients on verapamil and 71% of the patients on atenolol both in the supine and upright positions; there was no significant difference between the 2 drugs. A moderate decrease in heart rate was obtained. Sinus bradycardia was observed in 3 patients on verapamil and 4 patients on atenolol. No instances of atrioventricular block were observed on electrocardiogram. No adverse effects were reported with verapamil and in only 1 patient taking atenolol. Adequate stabilization of hypertension appears possible in most patients with both verapamil and atenolol.
Angioedema has been reported to occur in association with all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors used in the United States. We reviewed nine cases of angioedema associated with lisinopril use seen in the emergency department at our hospital among 1,970 patients that had been prescribed lisinopril from March 1989 to May 1990. Cases were considered as probably (six cases) or possibly (three cases) drug related, depending on the temporal relationship of the initiation of therapy and the onset of angioedema. All of the cases had edema of the lips, buccal mucosa, and or face. None presented with laryngeal edema or stridor. The angioedema resolved within 1 to 2 days with diphenhydramine treatment and discontinuation of lisinopril. Our data suggest that the incidence of angioedema associated with lisinopril is greater than that associated with captopril or enalapril.
The incidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to the use of indirect serotinergic agonists such as aminorex and dexfenfluramine led to the "serotonin hypothesis" of pulmonary arterial hypertension; however, the role of serotonin in dexfenfluramine-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension remains controversial. Here, we used novel transgenic mice lacking peripheral serotonin (deficient in tryptophan hydroxylase-1; Tph1(-/-) mice) or overexpressing the gene for the human serotonin transporter (SERT; SERT(+) mice) to investigate this further.
Dexfenfluramine administration (5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) PO for 28 days) increased systolic right ventricular pressure and pulmonary vascular remodeling in wild-type mice but not in Tph1(-/-) mice, which suggests that dexfenfluramine-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension is dependent on serotonin synthesis. Dexfenfluramine was also administered to normoxic SERT(+) mice and SERT(+) mice exposed to chronic hypoxia. Dexfenfluramine and SERT overexpression had additive effects in increasing pulmonary vascular remodeling; however, in hypoxic SERT(+) mice, dexfenfluramine reduced both systolic right ventricular pressure and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Pulmonary arterial fibroblasts from SERT(+) mice, but not wild-type mice, proliferated in response to hypoxia. Dexfenfluramine inhibited hypoxia-induced proliferation of pulmonary arterial fibroblasts derived from SERT(+) mice in a manner dependent on SERT activity. Dexfenfluramine also inhibited the hypoxia-mediated increase in phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in SERT(+) pulmonary arterial fibroblasts.
The results suggest that peripheral serotonin is critical for the development of dexfenfluramine-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension and that dexfenfluramine and SERT overexpression have additive effects on pulmonary vascular remodeling. We propose that dexfenfluramine can also inhibit hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling via SERT activity and inhibition of hypoxia-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.
Beta-blocker therapy may improve cardiac function in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We tested the hypothesis that beta-blocker therapy produces favorable functional effects in dilated cardiomyopathy by altering the expression of myocardial genes that regulate contractility and pathologic hypertrophy.
We randomly assigned 53 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to treatment with a beta-adrenergic-receptor blocking agent (metoprolol or carvedilol) or placebo. The amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) for contractility-regulating genes (those encoding beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors, calcium ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and alpha- and beta-myosin heavy-chain isoforms) and of genes associated with pathologic hypertrophy (beta-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic peptide) was measured with a quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in total RNA extracted from biopsy specimens of the right ventricular septal endomyocardium. Myocardial levels of beta-adrenergic receptors were also measured. Measurements were conducted at base line and after six months of treatment, and changes in gene expression were compared with changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by radionuclide ventriculography.
Twenty-six of 32 beta-blocker-treated patients (those with complete mRNA measurements) had an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 5 ejection-fraction (EF) units (mean [+/-SE] increase, 18.8+/-1.8). As compared with the six beta-blocker-treated patients who did not have a response (mean change, a decrease of 2.5+/-1.8 EF units), those who did have a response had an increase in sarcoplasmic-reticulum calcium ATPase mRNA and alpha-myosin heavy chain mRNA and a decrease in beta-myosin heavy chain mRNA. The change in sarcoplasmic-reticulum calcium ATPase was not present in the patients in the placebo group who had a spontaneous response. There were no differences between those who had a response and those who did not in terms of the change in mRNA or protein expression of beta-adrenergic receptors.
In idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, functional improvement related to treatment with beta-blockers is associated with changes in myocardial gene expression.
It was the aim of our study based on a group of 460 patients suffering from Parkinson's disease to find out possible pathogenetic linkups for the so-called "on-off" phenomenon. The method was based on two questionnaires of different structure, and in 90 cases we also called personally on the patient in his home. The patients were either known from neurological treatment they received at the Department of Neurology of the University of Essen, or were approached on-target via their membership in the German Parkinson Association. After evaluation, 43 patients with an on-off phenomenon and 81 with end-of-dose akinesia, as well as 336 patients without fluctuations of motility, could be classified and evaluated further. All patients with an on-off phenomenon or end-of-dose akinesia had received L-dopa treatment for several years; the average treatment period was 8.4 years in a patient with on-off phenomenon and 7.3 years in case of end-of-dose akinesia. Compared therewith, patients without fluctuations had only an average L-Dopa intake period of 5 years. It is a striking fact that in the patient group without fluctuations (n = 336) 51 patients (15.7%) had never taken an L-dopa preparation. 72.1% of the on-off group suffered from hyperkinesia before abrupt onset of the phase, while at the same time a recession of L-dopa efficacy was seen after several years of treatment. In about 40% of the questioned on-off patients we found that end-of-dose akinesia had preceded the on-off condition, and that the time correlation of the akinesia with the intake of the preparation was gradually abandoned. The age of the patients with on-off or end-of-dose patterns was, at the time of diagnosis, 55.6 or 54.2 years respectively. These patients were therefore much younger on the average than those of the comparative group without any disturbance of motility (60.1 years). On-off patients suffered comparatively more often from concomitant cardiovascular disease and their more active smoking habits were very noticeable. Taking the pathological specialities into consideration, it is recommended to critically reconsider the early use of L-dopa in relatively young patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases, and to give preference in case of an indication for L-dopa to a combination treatment especially with MAO-B inhibitors and dopamin antagnonists in order to keep the daily L-dopa dose low. Arguments against L-dopa to be taken three times daily are discussed, as are the pros and cons of concomitant therapy.
Nasal inhalation of substances such as cocaine has long been linked to septal necrosis and more recently to palatal perforation. This report describes the case of a 37-year-old man who was addicted to crushed OxyContin (sustained-release oxycodone HCl) tablets and who presented with total necrosis of the septum, sinuses, and soft palate. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first reported case of nasal and palatal necrosis linked to nasal inhalation of crushed OxyContin, which is a relatively new form of drug abuse. The pathophysiology of drug-induced sinonasal disease and a review of the literature are also presented.
Retinoids, which are derivatives of vitamin A, are important factors involved in the control of biologic functions such as cell growth and differentiation, development, and carcinogenesis. We have shown previously that the naturally occurring retinoids all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and 9-cisretinoic acid (9cRA) induce growth inhibition followed by apoptosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in vitro.
To evaluate the efficacy of retinoids in combination with the chemotherapeutic drugs gemcitabine and cisplatin.
In vitro growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis by different combinations of retinoids and cytotoxic drugs were studied by using the T3M-4 and BxPc-3 cell lines. For in vivo studies, T3M-4 cells were injected subcutaneously in nude mice.
Pre-treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells with ATRA or 9cRA before the addition of the drugs resulted in significant reduction in cell number compared with treatment with the drugs alone. Pre-treatment with 9cRA followed by gemcitabine or cisplatin alone also resulted in a strong increase in the percentage of cells undergoing programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Furthermore, there was an indication that the combination of ATRA and gemcitabine caused increased apoptosis in vivo.
Our results clearly suggest the need for additional studies exploring the potential role of the combination of retinoids and gemcitabine in the management of pancreatic cancer.
Premature termination from outpatient cocaine treatment predicts a number of poor outcomes, including higher rates of relapse and unemployment. This study attempted to predict dropouts from outpatient cocaine treatment, as well as those unable to achieve initial abstinence from cocaine, using two baseline variables that had previously been shown to predict treatment dropout: a measure of the severity of cocaine abstinence symptomatology using the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA) and the initial urine toxicology. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that those with more intense abstinence symptoms, as measured by the CSSA, were five times more likely to terminate treatment prematurely. When combined with the CSSA, the initial urine did not significantly predict dropouts. The CSSA and the baseline urine were equal in their ability to predict those who would fail in their initial attempts to achieve abstinence. Implications for treatment are discussed.
The mechanism of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is not understood. Here, we hypothesized that apoptosis of endothelial cells induced by p53 and its target gene em dash p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) played an important role in development of cerebral vasospasm. We also observed the effects of a p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha), on reducing the expression of p53 and PUMA, consequently decreasing the apoptosis of endothelial cells and alleviating cerebral vasospasm.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300-350 g were randomly divided into five groups: a control group (sham surgery), a SAH group, a SAH+dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) group, a SAH + PFT-alpha (0.2 mg/kg) group and a SAH + PFT-alpha (2.0 mg/kg) group. PFT-alpha was injected intraperitoneally immediately after SAH. Rats were sacrificed 24 hours after SAH. Western blot and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect the levels of p53, PUMA and caspase-3 protein. In addition, mortality and neurological scores were assessed for each group. Statistical significance was assured by analysis of variance performed in one way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test. The neurological and mortality scores were analyzed by Dunn's method and Fisher exact test, respectively.
After SAH, Western blot and immunohistochemical staining showed the levels of p53, PUMA and caspase-3 in the endothelial cells and the numbers of TdT mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) positive endothelial cells were all significantly increased in the basilar arteries (P<0.05), but significantly reduced by PFT-alpha (P<0.05). These changes were accompanied by increasing diameters and declining wall thickness of basilar arteries (P<0.05), as well as reduced mortality and neurological deficits of the rats (P<0.05).
PFT-alpha could protect cerebral vessels from development of vasospasm and improve neurological outcome as well as reduce the mortality via suppressing apoptosis induced by p53 in the endothelial cells of cerebral vessels.
Angioedema is a well-known complication of medical therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Isolated uvular angioedema, a rare presentation of angioedema, in a patient taking lisinopril (Zestril) is described in this case report. Management of uvular edema is also reviewed.
Lithocholic acid (LCA) supplementation in the diet results in intrahepatic cholestasis and bile infarcts. Previously we showed that an innate immune response is critical for cholestatic liver injury in the bile duct ligated mice. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of neutrophils in the mechanism of liver injury caused by feeding mice a diet containing LCA. C57BL/6 mice were given control or 1% LCA containing diet for 24-96 h and then examined for parameters of hepatotoxicity. Plasma ALT levels were significantly increased by 48 h after LCA feeding, which correlated with both neutrophil recruitment to the liver and upregulation of numerous pro-inflammatory genes. The injury was confirmed by histology. Deficiency in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression or inhibition of neutrophil function failed to protect against the injury. Bile acid levels were quantified in plasma and bile of LCA-fed mice after 48 and 96 h. Only the observed biliary levels of taurochenodeoxycholic acid and potentially tauro-LCA caused direct cytotoxicity in mouse hepatocytes. These data support the conclusion that neutrophil recruitment occurs after the onset of bile acid-induced necrosis in LCA-fed animals, and is not a primary mechanism of cell death when cholestasis occurs through accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids.
Cancer is primarily a disease of old age, and that life style plays a major role in the development of most cancers is now well recognized. While plant-based formulations have been used to treat cancer for centuries, current treatments usually involve poisonous mustard gas, chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies. While traditional plant-derived medicines are safe, what are the active principles in them and how do they mediate their effects against cancer is perhaps best illustrated by curcumin, a derivative of turmeric used for centuries to treat a wide variety of inflammatory conditions. Curcumin is a diferuloylmethane derived from the Indian spice, turmeric (popularly called "curry powder") that has been shown to interfere with multiple cell signaling pathways, including cell cycle (cyclin D1 and cyclin E), apoptosis (activation of caspases and down-regulation of antiapoptotic gene products), proliferation (HER-2, EGFR, and AP-1), survival (PI3K/AKT pathway), invasion (MMP-9 and adhesion molecules), angiogenesis (VEGF), metastasis (CXCR-4) and inflammation (NF-kappaB, TNF, IL-6, IL-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX). The activity of curcumin reported against leukemia and lymphoma, gastrointestinal cancers, genitourinary cancers, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, melanoma, neurological cancers, and sarcoma reflects its ability to affect multiple targets. Thus an "old-age" disease such as cancer requires an "age-old" treatment.
Erythropoietin (Epo) and the epo-receptor (EpoR) have been implicated in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. We previously demonstrated Epo and EpoR expression in a small group of archived papillary thyroid cancers (PTC), but were unable to examine functional integrity using formalin-fixed tissues. In the present study, we examined the in vitro expression, induction and function of Epo and EpoR in papillary (NPA), follicular (WRO) and anaplastic (ARO-81) thyroid cancer cells. We found that all three cell lines expressed Epo and EpoR mRNA and that the hypoxia-mimetic cobalt induced Epo expression in all cell lines. None of the growth factors we examined (thyrotropin, vascular endothelial growth factor, IGF-I, or human Epo) altered Epo or EpoR gene expression. Importantly, however, administration of Epo to NPA but not WRO cells resulted in significant alterations in the expression of several mitogenic genes including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), beta-casein (CSN2), wild type p53-induced gene-1 (WIG1) and cathepsin D (CTSD). Epo treated ARO-81 cells only had an increase in CSN2 expression. We conclude that Epo and EpoR are expressed by thyroid cancers and that stimulation of the Epo/EpoR signal pathway results in changes that could impact on the clinical behavior of thyroid cancers.
Concurrent dependence on cocaine and alcohol is common among patients seeking addiction treatment. This study was undertaken to explore the effectiveness of naltrexone (150 mg) as a potential treatment for patients who are alcohol and cocaine dependent. Of 15 subjects enrolled in the 12-week, open medication trial, 7 subjects did not complete the study. Relapse to clinically significant drinking occurred in 7 subjects (47%). There was a reduction in the average daily amount of alcohol consumed from pretreatment to treatment (p < .001) and the percentage of days engaged in drinking behavior (p < .001). Similarly, there was a reduction in the average weekly amount spent on cocaine from pretreatment to treatment (p = .001) and the percentage of days using cocaine (p < .001). This preliminary study suggests that naltrexone (150 mg) may be tolerable in patients dependent upon alcohol and cocaine and may be effective in reducing both cocaine and alcohol use. The results of this study provide a rationale for a double-blind placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of naltrexone in this difficult to treat but prevalent population.
1. Fenoldopam mesylate, a benzazepine derivative, is a D1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure through vasodilation of renal, mesenteric, coronary and cerebral vascular beds. 2. Experiments were performed in rats, and mean carotid blood pressure and heart rate were registered. Two series of experiments were performed: (1) fenoldopam as control group and (2) fenoldopam after pretreatment with one of the following drugs: the D1 antagonist SCH 23390, the D2 antagonist sulpiride, the selective beta1-adrenergic antagonist atenolol, the selective beta2-adrenergic antagonist ICI 118.551, the nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and the neurotoxin that destroys catecholaminergic nerve terminals 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OH-DA). 3. Fenoldopam produced a dose-dependent hypotensive effect that was not modified by pretreatment of the rat with atenolol or propranolol; however, ICI 118.551 produced a significant reduction of the hypotensive response induced by fenoldopam. 4. Pretreatment of the animals with SCH 23390 produced a significant dose-related reversal of the rat blood pressure reduction induced by low doses of fenoldopam. Sulpiride produced a result similar to that induced by pretreatment with SCH 23390. 5. The pretreatment of the animals with 6-OH-DA surprisingly attenuated the response induced by fenoldopam and produced only a significant reversal of the reduction of mean blood pressure induced with the lower dose of fenoldopam. 6. The findings obtained in the present work do not provide further evidence of direct participation of beta2-adrenergic receptors on the mechanism of action of fenoldopam. Its action seems to be mainly due to activation of D1 cardiovascular receptors.
L-Dopa plus carbidopa treatment remains the first-line therapy in Parkinson's disease. The use of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and/or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors as an adjunct to L-dopa therapy has yielded varying degrees of success. Quercetin, a flavonoid present in many plants, is reported to inhibit COMT and MAO activities, the key enzymes involved in the metabolism of dopamine. In the present study we have studied the effect of quercetin on the L-dopa plus carbidopa combination against perphenazine and reserpine-induced catalepsy in rats. Neuroleptic-induced catalepsy is a widely accepted animal model for testing the drugs used in parkinsonism. Catalepsy in rats was induced by administration of perphenazine (5 mg/kg i.p.) or reserpine (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) + alpha-methyl-P-tyrosine (200 mg/kg i.p.). Catalepsy in animals was assessed by using the bar test. The quercetin dose (25-100 mg/kg, p.o.) dependently reversed perphenazine- as well as reserpine-induced catalepsy. When quercetin was combined with a subthreshold dose of L-dopa plus carbidopa, the anticatatonic effect was potentiated. Pretreatment with a central COMT inhibitor, 3,5-dinitrocatechol (OR-486) (10 mg/kg p.o.), or a MAO-B inhibitor, selegiline (5 mg/kg i.p.), also potentiated the actions of threshold dose of quercetin against perphenazine- or reserpine-induced catalepsy. On the other hand adenosine (100 mg/kg i.p.), which is known to decrease the release of catecholamines through an action on presynaptic A(1) receptors, partly reversed the protective effect of quercetin against perphenazine-induced catalepsy. Quercetin through its COMT and MAO enzyme-inhibiting properties might potentiate the anticatatonic effect of L-dopa plus carbidopa treatment. The results of the present study strongly suggest that quercetin could serve as an effective adjunct to L-dopa therapy in Parkinson's disease.
Clozapine is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agent, which has been proven efficient against the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, with a low propensity to induce tardive dyskinesia (TD). Compared with typical antipsychotics, it has a greater affinity for dopamine D4 than D2 receptors and additional action on serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors. Due to its weak D(2) blocking action, it produces few extra pyramidal side effects and TD is rare. TD is one of the muscular side effects of antipsychotic drugs, especially the older generation like haloperidol. TD does not occur until after many months or years of taking antipsychotic drugs. TD is primarily characterized by abnormal involuntary movements of the tongue, lips or jaw, as well as facial grimacing or extremities that develop in association with the use of antipsychotic medications. TD can be embarrassing to the affected patient in public. The movements disappear during sleep and women are at greater risk than men for developing TD.
The study was planned to determine cholinergic influence on different stages of memory - acquisition, consolidation and recall in scopolamine-induced amnesia (memory impairment) in mice.
To study acquision, consolidation and recall stages of memory, we administered scopolamine (0.75, 1.5 and 3 mg/kg ip) 30 minutes and five minutes prior to first trial acquisition and consolidation and 30 minutes prior to second trial recall of passive avoidance (PA) test, respectively, in separate groups. Tacrine (5 mg/kg po) and rivastigmine (5 mg/kg po) were administered one hour prior to first trial in separate groups which received scopolamine (3 mg/kg ip) 30 minutes and five minutes prior to first trial where as the control group received vehicle only.
In the control group, there was a significant (P < 0.01) increase in transfer latency time (TLT) in the second trial compared to first indicating successful learning. In scopolamine treated groups, administering scopolamine 30 minutes or five minutes prior to first trial did not show any significant (P > 0.05) change in TLT whereas mice treated with scopolamine 30 minutes prior to second trial showed significant (P < 0.01) increase in TLT in second trial as compared to the first. Both tacrine and rivastigmine administration in scopolamine treated mice showed significant (P < 0.05-0.01) increase in TLT in second trial as compared to first trial while the rivastigmine treated group showed greater percentage retention compared to tacrine treated group.
Results show that acquisition and consolidation are more susceptible to the scopolamine effects than recall. Thus, it may be concluded that cholinergic influence is more on acquisition and consolidation as compared to recall.
Turmeric and its active principle curcumin have been extensively investigated for their antimutagenic and antioxidant effects in bacterial and animal systems. Because oral cancers are common in India, an experimental model of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene-induced buccal pouch tumors in Syrian Golden hamsters was used to evaluate the tumor retardation effects of turmeric and curcumin. Turmeric and/or curcumin was administered in the diet and/or applied locally for 14 weeks along with 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene. After the experimental period, the animals were sacrificed and oral pouches were examined for tumor number and size. DNA adducts were estimated by 32P postlabel assay in the cheek pouches. Neoplastic changes were graded by histopathology. The results of the study suggest that turmeric or curcumin in the diet and/or applied locally significantly reduced DNA adducts at the target site. Tumor number and tumor burden were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the animals that received turmeric in the diet and applied locally. The histopathological examinations suggested that the neoplastic grading was least in the animals fed or painted with curcumin (p < 0.05). The current study demonstrates that turmeric or curcumin administered in the diet or applied as paint may have a plausible chemopreventive effect on oral precancerous lesions.
The syndrome of pituitary apoplexy has been reported to occur after the administration of several different medications. We report a case in which pituitary apoplexy developed shortly after the administration of leuprolide in a patient with prostate cancer. Leuprolide is a potent gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue used to suppress leuteotrophic hormone (LH) and testosterone levels in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. LH and testosterone levels actually rise in the first week after its administration before becoming suppressed. We suspect that this acute stimulating effect of leuprolide is linked to the acute onset of pituitary apoplexy in a patient with a possible gonadotrophoma.
We compared the experimental toxicities and activities of deoxycholate amphotericin B (d-AmB) dissolved in glucose (Dd-AmB) or mixed with 20% Intralipid (ILd-AmB). In vitro, ILd-AmB against renal tubular cells in primary culture. In vivo, the toxicities and activities of Dd-AmB and ILd-AmB were studied in DBA2 mice with cryptococcosis. The maximum tolerated dose of intravenously administered d-AmB, i.e., the dose that induced less than 15% mortality because of toxicity, was 1.7 to 2.5 times higher when it was administered as ILd-AmB than when it was administered as Dd-AmB. Both treatments given intravenously at the same dose were equivalent for improving the survival of mice and reducing CFU counts in infected tissue, but at maximum tolerated doses, ILd-AmB (2 mg/kg of body weight) was more effective than Dd-AmB (0.8 to 1.2 mg/kg). AmB concentrations in spleen, liver, lung, and kidney were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography 4 and 24 h after a single injection of 1.2 mg of Dd-AmB per kg, 1.2 mg of ILd-AmB per kg, or 2 mg of ILd-AmB per kg. In a given organ, AmB levels were similar after administration of 1.2 mg of Dd-AmB or ILd-AmB per kg but were significantly higher after administration of 2 mg of ILd-AmB per kg. The lower level of toxicity of ILd-AmB might be explained by circular dichroism experiments, showing that ILd-AmB contained 10-fold less soluble oligomeric AmB, which is believed to be the toxic form of the drug, than Dd-AmB. We conclude that ILd-AmB is as efficient as Dd-AmB and is better tolerated than Dd-AmB in mice with experimental cryptococcosis. By allowing higher doses of AmB to be infused, Intralipid enhances AmB concentrations in infected sites, and thus the therapeutic activity of the drug.
The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the dose of nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on the increased risk of mortality seen in the randomized secondary-prevention trials and to review the mechanisms by which this adverse effect might occur.
We restricted the dose-response meta-analysis to the 16 randomized secondary-prevention trials of nifedipine for which mortality data were available. Recent trials of any calcium antagonist and formulation were also reviewed for information about the possible mechanisms of action that might increase mortality. Overall, the use of nifedipine was associated with a significant adverse effect on total mortality (risk ratio, 1.16, with a 95% CI of 1.01 to 1.33). This summary estimate fails to draw attention to an important dose-response relationship. For daily doses of 30 to 50, 60, and 80 mg, the risk ratios for total mortality were 1.06 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.27), 1.18 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.50), and 2.83 (95% CI, 1.35 to 5.93), respectively. In a formal test of dose response, the high doses of nifedipine were significantly associated with increased mortality (P = .01). While the mechanism of this adverse effect is not known, there are several plausible explanations, including the established proischemic effect, negative inotropic effects, marked hypotension, recently reported prohemorrhagic effects attributed to antiplatelet and vasodilatory actions of calcium antagonists, and possibly proarrhythmic effects.
In patients with coronary disease, the use of short-acting nifedipine in moderate to high doses causes an increase in total mortality. Other calcium antagonists may have similar adverse effects, in particular those of the dihydropyridine type. Long-term safety data are lacking for most calcium antagonists.
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive vasculitis is an uncommon complication of the use of propylthiouracil. When it occurs, it affects multiple organs as any systemic vasculitis. We report three females and one male, aged 30, 40, 43 and 41 years respectively, that after a lapse of 12 to 28 months of propylthiouracil use, presented clinical signs of vasculitis. All had high titers of ANCA against myeloperoxidase. In three patients, a skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The condition subsided when propylthiouracil was discontinued, but one female patient required the use of prednisone.
