Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant intracranial tumour that develops in both adults and children. Microarray gene analyses have confirmed that the human YKL-40 gene is one of the most over-expressed genes in these tumours but not in normal brain tissue. Clinical studies have shown that serum YKL-40 levels are positively correlated with tumour burden in addition to being an independent prognostic factor of a short relapse-free interval as well as short overall survival in patients with various cancers. Our previous study revealed that YKL-40 was closely correlated with the pathological grades of human primary astrocytomas and played a crucial role in glioma cell proliferation. Hence, YKL-40 could be an attractive target in the design of anti-cancer therapies.
Cell viability and invasion assays were performed to detect the cell proliferation and invasive ability of U87 cells induced by resveratrol (3, 5, 4'-trihydroxystilbene; Res) or YKL-40 small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In addition, the luciferase assay, real-time RT-PCR, western blotting, and ELISA were used to measure YKL-40 promoter activity, mRNA, and protein expression, respectively. The expressions of phosphor-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 were determined by western blotting.
Res inhibited U87 cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and repressed YKL-40 in U87 cells by decreasing the activity of its promoter and reducing mRNA transcription and protein expression in vitro. YKL-40 siRNA treatment also impaired the invasiveness of U87 cells. When U87 cells were cultured with 20 μM PD98059 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor) alone, with 20 μM PD98059 and 100 μM Res, or with 100 μM Res alone for 48 h, YKL-40 protein expression decreased most significantly in the Res-treated group. PD98059 partially reversed the decrease of YKL-40 protein expression induced by Res. Furthermore, phosphor-ERK1/2 expression was reduced by Res treatment in a time-dependent manner.
We demonstrated for the first time that Res represses YKL-40 expression in vitro; in addition, the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in this repression. This finding could extend the prospective use of Res in glioma research and enlarge the armamentarium for treating gliomas.
This study systematically analyzed the incidence and variety of adverse reactions to quinidine sulfate in 652 consecutively monitored hospitalized patients. Fourteen percent of the patients sustained adverse reactions of sufficient severity to warrant discontinuation of the drug. These reactions include GI intolerance, cardiac arrhythmias, fever with and without associated hepatic dysfunction or leukopenia, cinchonism, and hemolytic anemia. Cardiac arrhythmias were infrequent and, when present, generally occurred within 3 days of institution of quinidine therapy. There were no quinidine-related fatalities in this study group.
The effects of (+)- and (-)-oxaprotiline, given repeatedly (10 mg/kg p.o., twice daily, 14 days), on the behavioural action of d-amphetamine and dopamine injected bilaterally into the nucleus accumbens were studied in rats. Repeated but not acute treatment with (+)- or (-)-oxaprotiline enhanced the d-amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity. Both enantiomers, given repeatedly but not acutely, attenuated the inhibition of exploration activity induced by dopamine and potentiated the stimulating effect of dopamine as assessed in the open field test. The results indicate that, like other antidepressants studied previously, both oxaprotilines increase the responsiveness of the dopamine mesolimbic system (nucleus accumbens) of the rat.
The nucleotide-binding protein Fhit, among the earliest and most frequently inactivated proteins in lung cancer, suppresses tumor formation by inducing apoptosis. In invertebrates, Fhit is encoded as a fusion protein with Nit, a member of the nitrilase superfamily. In mice, the Nit1 and Fhit genes have nearly identical expression profiles. According to the Rosetta Stone hypothesis, if the separate Nit and Fhit genes could be shown to occur in the same subset of genomes (that is, to share a phylogenetic profile), then the existence of a fusion protein in invertebrates and the coordinated expression of separate mRNAs in mouse suggest that Nit and Fhit function in the same pathway and that the structure of invertebrate NitFhit may reflect the nature of Nit-Fhit interactions.
To satisfy the phylogenetic profile criterion for functional significance of protein fusion events, we cloned additional Nit homologs from organisms with Fhit homologs. We used fluorescent nucleotide analogs of ApppA to follow the purification and to characterize the nucleotide specificity of NitFhit from Caenorhabditis elegans, crystallized the 200 kDa tetrameric complex, and solved the structure of NitFhit from a single mercury derivative phased by two-wavelength anomalous diffraction.
Nit monomers possess a new alpha-beta-beta-alpha sandwich fold with a presumptive Cys-Glu-Lys catalytic triad. Nit assembles into a tetrameric, 52-stranded beta box that binds Fhit dimers at opposite poles and displays Nit active sites around the middle of the complex. The most carboxy-terminal beta strand of each Nit monomer exits the core of the Nit tetramer and interacts with Fhit. Residence in the NitFhit complex does not alter the nucleotide specificity of Fhit dimers, which are oriented with ApppA-binding surfaces away from Nit.
Local injection of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (1-5 nmol) into the ventral lateral periaqueductal gray region of the midbrain produced a dose-dependent bradycardia with minimal effects on blood pressure in the urethane-anesthetized rat. The decrease in heart rate was maximal in the region of the nuclei of the third and fourth cranial nerves. Intravenous injection of carbachol (5 nmol) had little effect on the heart rate. Injection of (-)-nicotine (5 nmol) into this region of the brain produced a slight, but significant, increase in heart rate. Pretreatment with an intracranial injection of atropine greatly reduced the bradycardia response, whereas local injection of mecamylamine or hexamethonium had no effect. The bradycardia resulting from cholinergic stimulation in this area of the brain appears to result from an enhanced vagal influence on the heart, as pretreatment with intravenous atropine methyl nitrate (1 mg/kg) prevented the carbachol-induced bradycardia. The possible physiological significance of this response is discussed.
Repeated exposure to cocaine often leads to tolerance to effects on operant behavior, whereas sensitization often develops to effects on locomotor activity. The purpose of the present set of experiments was to examine if locomotor sensitization to cocaine would develop in the presence or absence of an operant contingency in rats. In Experiment 1, rats lever pressed on an FR schedule of reinforcement, and were administered chronic cocaine. Tolerance to effects of cocaine on lever pressing developed in most subjects. No subjects developed locomotor sensitization even when the operant contingency was removed. Experiment 2 examined effects of chronic cocaine administration in rats with no exposure to an operant contingency. Tolerance developed to locomotor effects of cocaine in some subjects, but none developed sensitization. In Experiment 3, rats were exposed to a shorter drug regimen, and given time off before a sensitization-test session. Some, but not all subjects showed locomotor sensitization during the test session. The present results, therefore, show that locomotor sensitization to cocaine is not an inevitable consequence of repeated exposure to the drug.
In a prospective study conducted in Mymensingh district of Bangladesh, 1, 273 patients were assessed for the presence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) was successfully administered to 715 patients with parasitologically confirmed infection. In the remaining 558, although there was clinical indication of VL, Leishmania donovani parasites could not be demonstrated. Administration of SAG in this group was on the grounds of the prevailing symptoms, exclusion of malaria and a positive direct agglutination test (DAT). Significant improvements in the clinical and hematological parameters were observed in 547 (98%) of the unconfirmed VL cases. On the basis of the parasitological findings or positive response to specific anti-Leishmania chemotherapy, the sensitivity and specificity of the DAT were 99.6% and 97.7% respectively. The results supported the reliability of DAT for diagnosis of VL at levels below that of parasitological detection.
The intentional adulteration of pet food with melamine and derivatives, including cyanuric acid, has been implicated in the kidney failure and death of a large number of cats and dogs in the United States. Although individually these compounds present low toxicity, coexposure can lead to the formation of melamine cyanurate crystals in the nephrons and eventual kidney failure. To determine the dose-response for nephrotoxicity upon coadministration of melamine and cyanuric acid, groups of male and female F344 rats (six animals per sex per group) were fed 0 (control), 7, 23, 69, 229, or 694 ppm of both melamine and cyanuric acid; 1388 ppm melamine; or 1388 ppm cyanuric acid in the diet for 7 days. No toxicity was observed in the rats exposed to the individual compounds, whereas anorexia and a statistically significant increase in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels was observed in the animals treated with 229 and 694 ppm melamine and cyanuric acid. The kidneys of these animals were grossly enlarged and pale yellow. Large numbers of crystalline structures deposited in the tubules were seen on sections in kidneys from all rats in these treatment groups. No significant changes were detected in the remaining treatment groups exposed to both melamine and cyanuric acid. In the melamine-only treatment group, 5 of 12 rats had scattered crystals present in renal tubules when examined by wet mount. These were not observed by histopathology. The observed adverse effect level (8.6 mg/kg bw [body weight]/day) and benchmark dose modeling data (8.4-10.9 mg/kg bw/day) determined in this study suggest that the tolerable daily intake values derived from studies conducted with melamine alone may underestimate the risk from coexposures to melamine and cyanuric acid.
The cases of American cutaneous leishmaniasis reported here were observed between 1995 and 1998 in outpatients at a health clinic in the sugar cane-producing region in the south of Pernambuco State (Brazil), in which the disease is known to be endemic. Two hundred thirty eight cases were reported, equivalent to about ten cases per thousand patients. The disease affected patients of all ages, with a slight male predominance. The lesions were generally single and located on the legs. They were successfully treated with Glucantime. Vectors of the disease, sandflies of the genus Lutzomyia, were captured in and around homes, particularly in stables. This field work demonstrates the extent of a long-standing endemic that can be effectively treated within motivated health structures.
The present study was carried out to determine whether beneficial effects of carvedilol in congestive heart failure (CHF) are mediated via its beta-adrenergic blocking, antioxidant, and/or alpha-adrenergic blocking action. Rabbits with heart failure induced by rapid cardiac pacing were randomized to receive subcutaneous carvedilol, metoprolol, propranolol plus doxazosin, or placebo pellets for 8 wk and compared with sham-operated rabbits without pacing. We found rapid cardiac pacing produced clinical heart failure, left ventricular dilation, and decline of left ventricular fractional shortening. This was associated with an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, decrease in left ventricular first derivative of left ventricular pressure, and myocyte hypertrophy. Tissue oxidative stress measured by GSH/GSSG was increased in the heart with increased oxidation product of mitochondrial DNA, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, increase of Bax, decrease of Bcl-2, and increase of apoptotic myocytes as measured by anti-single-stranded DNA monoclonal antibody. Administration of carvedilol and metoprolol, which had no effect in sham animals, attenuated cardiac ventricular remodeling, cardiac hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and myocyte apoptosis in CHF. In contrast, propranolol plus doxazosin, which has less antioxidant effects, produced smaller effects on left ventricular function and myocyte apoptosis. In all animals, GSH/GSSG correlated significantly with changes of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (r = -0.678, P < 0.0001), fractional shortening (r = 0.706, P < 0.0001), and apoptotic myocytes (r = -0.473, P = 0.0001). Thus our findings suggest antioxidant and antiapoptotic actions of carvedilol and metoprolol are important determinants of clinical beneficial effects of beta-receptors in the treatment of CHF.
Dioxin emissions from municipal solid waste incinerators are one of the major sources of dioxins and therefore are an exposure source of public concern. There is growing epidemiologic evidence of an increased risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in the vicinity of some municipal solid waste incinerators with high dioxin emission levels. The purpose of this study was to examine this association on a larger population scale.
The study area consisted of four French administrative departments, comprising a total of 2270 block groups. NHL cases that had been diagnosed during the period 1990-1999, and were aged 15 years and over, were considered. Each case was assigned a block group by residential address geocoding. Atmospheric Dispersion Model System software was used to estimate immissions in the surroundings of 13 incinerators which operated in the study area. Then, cumulative ground-level dioxin concentrations were calculated for each block group. Poisson multiple regression models, incorporating penalized regression splines to control for covariates and dealing with Poisson overdispersion, were used. Five confounding factors were considered: population density, urbanisation, socio-economic level, airborne traffic pollution, and industrial pollution.
A total of 3974 NHL incident cases was observed (2147 among males, and 1827 among females) during the 1990-1999 time period. A statistically significant relationship was found at the block group level between risk for NHL and dioxin exposure, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.120 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.002 - 1.251) for persons living in highly exposed census blocks compared to those living in slightly exposed block groups. Population density appeared positively linked both to risk for NHL and dioxin exposure. Subgroup multivariate analyses per gender yielded a significant RR for females only (RR = 1.178, 95% CI 1.013 - 1.369).
This study, in line with previous results obtained in the vicinity of the incinerator located in Besançon (France), adds further evidence to the link between NHL incidence and exposure to dioxins emitted by municipal solid waste incinerators. However, the findings of this study cannot be extrapolated to current incinerators, which emit lower amounts of pollutants.
This article reviews the history of pharmacologic trials for the treatment of cocaine dependence as well as current treatments under investigation. The rationale for use of agents such as dopaminergic agents, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants is discussed. Early clinical trials with pharmacologic agents have demonstrated both positive and negative results; the possible reasons for these mixed outcomes is also discussed. Recent studies focusing on disulfiram, dopamine-selective antagonists, citicoline, aspirin, and a cocaine-specific vaccine are presented to highlight innovative and potentially effective treatments for individuals with cocaine dependence.
Studies investigating carbamazepine (CBZ) in the treatment of cocaine dependence have been inconsistent. In this study, cocaine-dependent individuals with (n = 57) and without (n = 82) affective disorder were compared in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Urine drug screens (UDS) and self-report of drug use were collected weekly. Affective symptoms were measured monthly. Subjects receiving CBZ attended more medication sessions (p = .03). The CBZ-treated affective group had a trend toward fewer cocaine-positive UDS (p = .08) and a significantly longer time to first cocaine use (p = .06). CBZ treatment did not have any impact on cocaine use in individuals without affective disorders.
To demonstrate relationships between plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and fat expansions in the fat redistribution syndrome.
Patients who had significant buffalo humps or intra-abdominal fat (IAF) expansions were identified and their HDL levels were measured. Control patients were all those undergoing a single trial of antiretroviral treatment. Some patients answered a self-administered questionnaire concerning self-perceived fat expansions, and their responses were related to their HDL levels. In other patients, relationships were studied between IAF measured by cross-section computerized tomography scans and HDL levels. Finally, patients who had IAF > 70 cm(2), were administered niacin, 3000 mg/day for > or = 6 months, in order to test whether raising HDL induced a decrease in IAF.
Twenty-three patients with buffalo humps had mean HDL of 30.4 mg/dl; 47 HIV-positive controls had mean HDL of 41.9 mg/dl (P = 0.001). In 27 patients, IAF area and HDL were negatively correlated (r, 0.40; P = 0.04). Among these 27, the 17 patients with IAF area > 100 cm(2) had mean HDL of 35.3 mg/dl; the 10 patients with IAF area < 100 cm(2) had mean HDL of 51 mg/dl (P < 0.05). The 24 patients who indicated in a questionnaire that they had self-perceived IAF expansion had a median HDL of 36.0 mg/dl; the 20 who indicated that they did not have IAF expansion had a median HDL of 44.5mg/dl (P = 0.06). IAF decreased by 26.9% in 13 (81%) of the 16 patients who took niacin for 1 year; and the decrease in IAF was associated with a significant (P = 0.002) increase in HDL.
In this 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate (MTP) versus placebo in 48 cocaine-dependent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) adults, the authors sought to determine whether MTP would be safe, control ADHD symptoms, and affect cocaine use. Efficacy indexes revealed significantly greater ADHD symptom relief in the MTP group. There were no group differences in self-reported cocaine use, urinalysis results, or cocaine craving. Because of the relatively small sample size, the results are preliminary. However, we found that MTP improved subjective reports of ADHD symptoms and did not worsen cocaine use while participants were in treatment.
We previously identified a novel endogenous substance, serofendic acid, from a lipophilic extract of fetal calf serum. The compound, a low-molecular-weight sulfur-containing atisane-type diterpenoid, exhibited potent protective action against neurotoxicity induced by glutamate, nitric oxide, and oxidant stress. We investigated whether this substance has a cardioprotective effect. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were exposed to oxidant stress (H2O2) to induce cell death. Pretreatment with serofendic acid significantly suppressed cell death induced by H2O2, and the cytoprotective effect was closely associated with the preservation of mitochondrial function. Serofendic acid inhibited H2O2-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in a concentration-dependent manner (with saturation by 100 microM), by attenuating matrix calcium overload and intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The protective effect of serofendic acid was comparable to that of a mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mitoK ATP) channel opener, diazoxide. Furthermore, mitoK ATP channel blocker, 5-hydroxydecanoate, abolished the protective effect of serofendic acid. Serofendic acid and diazoxide, administered together, at 100 microM each, had no additive effects. Thus, serofendic acid inhibited the oxidant-induced mitochondrial death pathway, presumably through activation of the mitoK(ATP) channel. In conclusion, serofendic acid appears to protect cardiac myocytes from oxidant-induced cell death by preserving the functional integrity of mitochondria. Our findings suggest that serofendic acid may represent a novel candidate for cardioprotective therapy in ischemia/reperfusion injury.
The incidence of amrinone-induced thrombocytopenia has been reported to be 2.4 percent in patients receiving intravenous therapy. To date there have been no reports of bleeding in these patients nor have there been reports of other hematologic abnormalities secondary to amrinone administration. This case report describes a patient whose hematologic values began to decrease after two days of amrinone therapy, reaching a nadir at day 8. Values returned to baseline eight days after treatment was discontinued. This report provides the first evidence that amrinone may induce pancytopenia in patients who receive short courses of high-dose, continuous-infusion amrinone.
Several forms of hepatic toxicity have been described with the antifungal agent ketoconazole. We report a case of massive liver enlargement with fatty infiltration presenting as gastric compression. This occurred in a young woman with AIDS taking ketoconazole as maintenance therapy for cryptococcal meningitis. This is the first reported case of ketoconazole causing fatty change in the liver.
The effects of two protein synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide and anisomycin, were tested on seizures induced by coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine to rats. Systemic cycloheximide (2 mg/kg, s.c.) and centrally administered anisomycin (300 micrograms/10 microliters, i.c.v.) doubled the latency to initiation of seizures and to status epilepticus, while peripherally administered anisomycin (50 mg/kg, s.c.) completely blocked lithium-pilocarpine seizures. These results indicate that protein synthesis is required for initiation of seizures.
Nanoceria is used as a catalyst in diesel fuel, as an abrasive in printed circuit manufacture, and is being pursued as an antioxidant therapeutic. Our objective is to extend previous findings showing that there were no reductions of cerium in organs of the mononuclear phagocyte (reticuloendothelial) system up to 30 days after a single nanoscale ceria administration. An ~5% aqueous dispersion of citrate-stabilized 30 nm ceria, synthesized and characterized in-house, or vehicle, was iv infused into rats terminated 1, 7, 30, or 90 days later. Cageside observations were obtained daily, body weight weekly. Daily urinary and fecal cerium outputs were quantified for 2 weeks. Nine organs were weighed and samples collected from 14 tissues/organs/systems, blood and cerebrospinal fluid for cerium determination. Histology and oxidative stress were assessed. Less than 1% of the nanoceria was excreted in the first 2 weeks, 98% in feces. Body weight gain was initially impaired. Spleen weight was significantly increased in some ceria-treated groups, associated with abnormalities. Ceria was primarily retained in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. There was little decrease of ceria in any tissue over the 90 days. Granulomas were observed in the liver. Time-dependent oxidative stress changes were seen in the liver and spleen. Nanoscale ceria was persistently retained by organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system, associated with adverse changes. The results support concern about the long-term fate and adverse effects of inert nanoscale metal oxides that distribute throughout the body, are persistently retained, and produce adverse changes.
We conducted a phase I study in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel using an extended weekly schedule.
Patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were treated with paclitaxel administered weekly over 3 hours for 6 weeks of an 8-week cycle. Doses were modified for granulocyte counts less than 1,800/microL or neurotoxicity greater than grade I. Groups of three patients were entered at each dose level. The dose was escalated to the next level if less than 50% of patients developed unacceptable toxicity and received more than 80% of the intended first-cycle dose.
Twenty-six patients were entered through six dose levels (100, 125, 135, 150, 175, and 200 mg/m2/wk). Four of six patients at the 175-mg/m2 dose level and only one of six patients at the 200-mg/m2 level received all scheduled doses of paclitaxel during cycle 1. Neutropenia was dose-limiting. Fourteen patients were treated with subsequent cycles of paclitaxel. Grade II to III neuropathy developed in five of 24 patients. It occurred more commonly with greater duration of therapy, but improved following dose reduction. Nine of 26 (35% +/- 10%) patients demonstrated an objective response.
The MTD of paclitaxel using a weekly schedule is 175 mg/m2/wk for 6 of 8 weeks. Neutropenia limits dosing acutely, but neuropathy is limiting with sustained therapy. This schedule of paclitaxel results in a twofold to threefold increase in dose-intensity with less toxicity than anticipated from conventional dosing. Further evaluation of this schedule is warranted to assess efficacy and toxicity of prolonged administration.
Dyskinesias are a common consequence of dopaminergic therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease. Little is known about the influence of cellular replacement strategies upon drug-induced dyskinesias. In the current study, we employed parkinsonian rats to test whether the distribution of dopamine neuron grafts could differentially alter striatal circuitry and levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Specifically, we compared behavioral and neurochemical consequences of dopamine reinnervation restricted to a focal region of the striatum to innervation encompassing the majority of the striatum by distributing the same number of cells into single locus or multiple locations. Both the single-site and widespread grafts reduced pregraft dyskinesias and normalized FosB/DeltaFosB in the dorsal two-thirds of the lateral striatum. However, single-site DA graft recipients developed a robust, novel forelimb-facial stereotypy and upregulated FosB/DeltaFosB expression in the ventrolateral striatum, an area associated with movements of tongue and forelimbs. The onset of forelimb-facial stereotypy correlated with measures of increased graft function.
In rodents, treatment with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) agonists results in peroxisome proliferation, hepatocellular hypertrophy, and hepatomegaly. Drugs in the fibrate class of PPARalpha agonists have also been reported to produce rare skeletal muscle toxicity. Although target-driven hepatic effects of PPARalpha treatment have been extensively studied, a characterization of the transcriptional effects of this nuclear receptor/transcription factor on skeletal muscle responses has not been reported. In this study we investigated the effects of PPARalpha agonists on skeletal muscle gene transcription in rats. Further, since statins have been reported to preferentially effect type II muscle fibers, we compared PPARalpha signaling effects between type I and type II muscles. By comparing the transcriptional responses of agonists that signal through different nuclear receptors and using a selection/deselection analytical strategy based on ANOVA, we identified a PPARalpha activation signature that is evident in type I (soleus), but not type II (quadriceps femoris), skeletal muscle fibers. The fiber-type-selective nature of this response is consistent with increased fatty acid uptake and beta-oxidation, which represent the major clinical benefits of the hypolipidemic compounds used in this study, but does not reveal any obvious off-target pathways that may drive adverse effects.
Linezolid is the first antibacterial to be approved from the oxazolidinone class. The drug has substantial antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive organisms such as streptococci, staphylococci and enterococci, including species resistant to conventional antibacterial treatment. Linezolid is fully bioavailable following oral administration when compared with intravenous administration. Maximum plasma linezolid concentrations are usually achieved between 1 and 2 hours after oral administration. Food slightly decreases the rate, but not the extent, of absorption. The distribution of linezolid is approximately equivalent to total body water, and there is low protein binding (31%) to serum albumin. The elimination half-life of linezolid is 5-7 hours, and twice-daily administration of 400-600 mg provides steady-state concentrations in the therapeutic range. Linezolid is mainly cleared by non-renal clearance to two metabolites and renal clearance of the parent compound. Approximately 50% of an administered dose appears in the urine as the two major metabolites, and approximately 35% appears as parent drug. A small degree of nonlinearity has been observed, with a 30% decrease in clearance after a 5-fold increase in dose. The nonlinearity is not relevant over the therapeutic dosage range. Plasma linezolid concentrations in elderly patients, patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or mild to severe renal impairment are similar to those achieved in young or healthy volunteers. Higher concentrations are observed in women as compared with men, but the difference is not sufficient to warrant an adjustment in dosage. In patients with severe renal impairment requiring haemodialysis, the exposure to the two primary metabolites was 7 to 8-fold higher than in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, linezolid should be used with caution in patients with severe renal insufficiency. A higher clearance of linezolid was found in children as compared with adults, and therefore higher daily dosages per kg bodyweight are required in children. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction when linezolid is coadministered with aztreonam, gentamicin or warfarin. Linezolid is a mild, reversible, inhibitor of monoamine oxidases A and B. Coadministration of linezolid with the adrenergic agents pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine resulted in increases in blood pressure relative to these agents alone or to placebo. The degree of the change in blood pressure was within that associated with normal daily activities. No interaction was observed when linezolid was coadministered with the serotonergic agent dextromethorphan.
The novel anxiolytic drug, buspirone, reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol. A series of aryl-piperazine analogues of buspirone and other 5-hydroxytryptaminergic agonists were tested for their ability to reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy. Those drugs with strong affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy. Drugs with affinity for other 5-HT receptors or weak affinity were ineffective. However, inhibition of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of catalepsy and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect.
Since in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) is known to cause abnormalities of the female genital tract later in life, exposed male offspring were located, surveyed by mail, and compared with unexposed male offspring from the same period and medical practices. The exposed and unexposed respondents appeared comparable and did not differ in their response to most medical questions. However, a larger proportion of exposed than of unexposed boys had experienced problems in passing urine (12.9% vs. 1.8%, P = .0003) and abnormalities of the penile urethra (4.4% vs. 0%; P = .017).
Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a limiting side effect of chemotherapy with ifosfamide (IFS). Mesna is the drug of choice for prevention of HC. In this study, we analyzed cystoscopic and histological changes present in bladders of patients using IFS with mesna prophylaxis.
Thirty-three patients selected for IFS plus three doses of mesna chemotherapy regime were assigned at random to two groups: Group I or reference group consisted of 18 patients yet untreated. Group II consisted of 15 patients in whom urinalysis and cystoscopy plus vesical biopsy were performed only 24 h after receiving the last dose of IFS. The cystoscopic and histological findings were used as parameters for evaluating the results. For the former the criterion adopted was macroscopic vesical changes in accordance with Gray's criteria. Histological analyses were performed by evaluation method especially adapted to this study.
Even under treatment with three doses of mesna, 66.7% of patients presented cystoscopic alterations and 100% showed bladder mucosa microscopic alterations such as edema, exocytosis, and hemorrhage.
The standard protocol used for prevention of IFS-induced HC with three doses of mesna does not completely prevent bladder damage. The histopathological criteria used in this study for observation of inflammatory events allowed staging the intensity of IFS-induced urothelial and mucosal injury.
