Chromium exists mostly in two valence states in nature: hexavalent chromium [chromium(VI)] and trivalent chromium [chromium(III)]. Chromium(VI) is commonly used in industrial chrome plating, welding, painting, metal finishes, steel manufacturing, alloy, cast iron and wood treatment, and is a proven toxin, mutagen and carcinogen. The mechanistic cytotoxicity of chromium(VI) is not completely understood, however, a large number of studies demonstrated that chromium(VI) induces oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptotic cell death and altered gene expression. Conversely, chromium(III) is essential for proper insulin function and is required for normal protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism, and is acknowledged as a dietary supplement. In this paper, comparative concentration- and time-dependent effects of chromium(VI) and chromium(III) were demonstrated on increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, enhanced excretion of urinary lipid metabolites, DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cell death in both in vitro and in vivo models. Chromium(VI) demonstrated significantly higher toxicity as compared with chromium(III). To evaluate the role of p53 gene, the dose-dependent effects of chromium(VI) were assessed in female C57BL/6Ntac and p53-deficient C57BL/6TSG p53 mice on enhanced production of ROS, lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation in hepatic and brain tissues. Chromium(VI) induced more pronounced oxidative damage in multiple target organs in p53 deficient mice. Comparative studies of chromium(III) picolinate and niacin-bound chromium(III), two popular dietary supplements, reveal that chromium(III) picolinate produces significantly more oxidative stress and DNA damage. Studies have implicated the toxicity of chromium picolinate in renal impairment, skin blisters and pustules, anemia, hemolysis, tissue edema, liver dysfunction; neuronal cell injury, impaired cognitive, perceptual and motor activity; enhanced production of hydroxyl radicals, chromosomal aberration, depletion of antioxidant enzymes, and DNA damage. Recently, chromium picolinate has been shown to be mutagenic and picolinic acid moiety appears to be responsible as studies show that picolinic acid alone is clastogenic. Niacin-bound chromium(III) has been demonstrated to be more bioavailable and efficacious and no toxicity has been reported. In summary, these studies demonstrate that a cascade of cellular events including oxidative stress, genomic DNA damage and modulation of apoptotic regulatory gene p53 are involved in chromium(VI)-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis. The safety of chromium(III) is largely dependent on the ligand, and adequate clinical studies are warranted to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of chromium(III) for human consumption.
The effect of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and disulfiram (DSF) on the urotoxicity induced by cyclophosphamide (CPA) was examined in mice. Pretreatment of mice with BSO (500 mg/kg, i.p.) 5 hr prior to CPA resulted in enhanced urotoxicity of CPA. In contrast, simultaneous administration of DSF (200 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased the urotoxicity of CPA.
We investigated the effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)--induced hypotension during sevoflurane anesthesia on the cerebral blood flow (CBF), autoregulation and internal jugular venous O2 tension (PjO2) in 8 patients undergoing neurosurgery. Although the mean arterial pressure decreased from 95.3 +/- 3.8 mmHg (mean +/- SD) to 63.6 +/- 8.0 mmHg by continuous intravenous infusion of PGE1, CBF did not change significantly (97.2 +/- 10.6% of control value). During hypotensive anesthesia, autoregulation was well maintained in all patients, and the values of PjO2 did not suggest brain hypoxia at all. The results indicate that hypotensive anesthesia induced by PGE1 and sevoflurane is a safe and a reliable method for neuroanesthesia.
Because use of benzodiazepines may exacerbate existing substance use disorders or become abused substances, prescription of benzodiazepines for patients with severe mental illness (schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) and co-occurring substance use disorders (abuse or dependence) is controversial. The authors examined benzodiazepine use and associated psychiatric, substance abuse, and institutional outcomes in a six-year longitudinal study of patients with co-occurring disorders.
At baseline and yearly follow-up for six years, 203 patients with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorder were prospectively assessed for medication use, substance use, psychiatric symptoms, use of hospitalization, and quality of life.
Almost one-half of the patients (43 percent) reported taking prescribed benzodiazepines at the time of at least one assessment. Patients taking prescribed benzodiazepines were more likely to have high scores on measures of overall symptoms and affective symptoms (anxiety and depression) and low ratings for general quality of life throughout the study. Benzodiazepine use was unrelated to remission of substance use disorder or hospitalization, but a greater proportion of patients who were prescribed benzodiazepines developed benzodiazepine abuse, compared with those who were not prescribed benzodiazepines (15 percent compared with 6 percent).
Prescription benzodiazepine use was common among patients with co-occurring severe mental illness and a substance use disorder and was not associated with any of the measured outcomes other than increasing the likelihood of benzodiazepine abuse. Physicians should consider other treatments for anxiety in this population.
The effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and trimetaphan (TMP) on the plasma concentrations and derived pharmacokinetic parameters of bupivacaine were studied in 14 women after its epidural administration. Patients, whose ages ranging from 35 to 60 years for mastectomy, received 50 mg of bupivacaine without epinephrine injected into the cervical epidural space during PGE1- or TMP-induced hypotension (80-90 mmHg of the systolic arterial pressure) under general anesthesia with nitrous oxide, oxygen and isoflurane 0.3-0.5%. No significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for the absorption and distribution of bupivacaine were found between the two groups. However, the mean elimination half-life of bupivacaine was significantly longer in patients with TMP [5.0 +/- 1.7 (SD) hr] compared with those with PGE1 (3.1 +/- 1.4 hr). The total clearance of bupivacaine was greater in patients with PGE1 (345 +/- 150 ml.min-1) compared with those with TMP (248 +/- 66 ml.min-1). The results of this pharmacokinetic study indicate that the plasma bupivacaine concentration decreases more rapidly during PGE1-induced hypotension than during TMP-induced hypotension.
Present study investigates the beneficial role of arjunolic acid (AA) against the alteration in the cytokine levels and simultaneous activation of oxidative stress responsive signaling pathways in spleen under hyperglycemic condition. Diabetes was induced by injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (at a dose of 70 mg/kg body weight, injected in the tail vain). STZ administration elevated the levels of IL-2 as well as IFN-gamma and attenuated the level of TNF-alpha in the sera of diabetic animals. In addition, hyperglycemia is also associated with the increased production of intracellular reactive intermediates resulting with the elevation in lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation and reduction in intracellular antioxidant defense. Investigating the oxidative stress responsive cell signaling pathways, increased expressions (immunoreactive concentrations) of phosphorylated p65 as well as its inhibitor protein phospho IkappaBalpha and phosphorylated mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been observed in diabetic spleen tissue. Studies on isolated splenocytes revealed that hyperglycemia caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, elevation in the concentration of cytosolic cytochrome c as well as activation of caspase 3 leading to apoptotic cell death. Histological examination revealed that diabetic induction depleted the white pulp scoring which is in agreement with the reduced immunological response. Treatment with AA prevented the hyperglycemia and its associated pathogenesis in spleen tissue. Results suggest that AA might act as an anti-diabetic and immunomodulatory agent against hyperglycemia.
Aurora-A (Aur-A) is a centrosome-associated serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in various cancers and potentially correlated with chemoresistance. In the Ara-C-sensitive leukemia cell lines, silencing of Aur-A by small interfering RNA transfection led to a significant increase in the Ara-C-induced cell death rate through induction of mitochondria-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, combined treatment of the Ara-C-resistant leukemia cell lines with Aur-A siRNA and Ara-C remarkably enhanced the cell death rate via non-caspase-dependent mitotic catastrophe. Taken together, Aur-A inhibition was an effective treatment for both the Ara-C-sensitive and resistant leukemia cells by increasing apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe, respectively.
Previous human intervention trial demonstrated that vitamin E (Ve) and selenium (Se) supplementation decreased esophageal cancer deaths among younger participants, but may have no effect or produce an opposite effect among older ones. In our study, we intended to mimic this human nutritional trial to determine the chemopreventive effects of Ve/Se supplementation at the early or late stage of esophageal carcinogenesis in rats. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) was induced in Fischer 344 rats with N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBzA, 0.35 mg/kg BW, s.c., three times per week for 5 weeks). The rats were maintained on a modified AIN-93M diet with low levels of Ve/Se or supplemented with high levels of Ve/Se at different stages. At Week 25, the number and volume of visible tumors, the numbers of dysplasia and ESCC were significantly lower in rats of supplementation during the early stage (Group C) or during the entire experimental period (Group E), but not during the late stage (Group D). Ve/Se supplementation at the early stage also significantly decreased cell proliferation, nuclear factor kappaB (NFκB) activation, protein and mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and 5-lipoxygenase and biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 during the carcinogenesis of rat esophagus. Our results demonstrated that the chemopreventive efficacy of Ve/Se supplementation on NMBzA-induced esophageal cancer is time selective and that supplementation during the early stage is clearly effective but probably ineffective during the late stage of carcinogenesis. NFκB signaling pathway activation and aberrant arachidonic acid metabolism might be the underlying mechanism.
We evaluated the effects of vincristine on the gastrointestinal (GI) motility of awake rats and correlated them with the course of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy. Vincristine or saline was injected into the tail vein of male Wistar rats (180-250 g) on alternate days: 50 microg/kg (5 doses, N = 10), 100 microg/kg (2, 3, 4 and 5 doses, N = 49) or 150 microg/kg (1, 2, or 5 doses, N = 37). Weight and stool output were measured daily for each animal. One day after completing the vincristine treatment, the animals were fasted for 24 h, gavage-fed with a test meal and sacrificed 10 min later to measure gastric emptying (GE), GI transit and colon weight. Sensory peripheral neuropathy was evaluated by hot plate testing. Chronic vincristine treatments with total cumulative doses of at least 250 microg/kg significantly decreased GE by 31-59% and GI transit by 55-93%. The effect of 5 doses of vincristine (150 microg/kg) on GE did not persist for more than 1 week. Colon weight increased after 2 and 5 doses of vincristine (150 microg/kg). Fecal output decreased up to 48 h after the fifth dose of vincristine (150 microg/kg). Vincristine decreased the heat pain threshold 1 day after 5 doses of 50-100 microg/kg or after 3-5 doses of 150 microg/kg. This effect lasted for at least 2 weeks after the fifth dose. Chronic intravenous vincristine treatment delayed GE and GI transit of liquid. This effect correlated with the peak increase in colon weight but not with the pain threshold changes.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the antioxidant role of coumarin on streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced Type 2 diabetic rats. In experimental rats, the levels of plasma glucose, insulin, and the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, lipid hydroperoxides, conjugated dienes, and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase were assayed in liver and kidney. Diabetic rats showed elevated levels of plasma glucose and lipid peroxidation markers and reduced plasma insulin and antioxidant enzymes. Oral administration of coumarin resulted in a significant reduction in the plasma glucose and lipid peroxides and a significant increase in the plasma insulin and antioxidant enzymes. Chronic treatment of coumarin remarkably restored the normal status of the histopathological changes observed in the selected tissues. It can be concluded that coumarin has antioxidant effect in Type 2 diabetic rats.
Patients with metastatic (stage IV) non-small-cell lung cancer usually have a poor prognosis and disease refractory to chemotherapy. Three new agents--taxol, merbarone, and piroxantrone--have shown promising antitumor treatment in vitro and in animals. Taxol is an antimicrotubular agent that interferes with mitosis during cell division. Merbarone, a conjugate of thiobarbituric acid and aniline, is a topoisomerase II inhibitor, which thus inhibits DNA synthesis and tumor growth. Piroxantrone, an anthracenedione derivative, is a DNA intercalating agent that has shown potent antitumor activity in animal studies.
Our randomized phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of these agents in the treatment of stage IV metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.
Eligible patients (119) were randomly assigned to receive one of the three treatments given every 3 weeks: 250 mg/m2 taxol by a 24-hour intravenous infusion, 1000 mg/m2 merbarone by continuous intravenous infusion through a central catheter daily for 5 days, or 150 mg/m2 piroxantrone by intravenous infusion over 1 hour. Patients had received no chemotherapy. Response and toxicity were evaluated every 3 weeks.
Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive taxol, 47 to receive merbarone, and 47 to receive piroxantrone. One of 44 assessable patients (2.3%) treated with piroxantrone had a complete response. Rates for partial response were 20.8% (five of 24 patients) and 5.7% (two of 35) for assessable patients treated with taxol or merbarone, respectively. One-year survival rates were 41.7%, 21.6%, and 22.6%, and median survival times were 24.1, 19.9, and 29.3 weeks for taxol, merbarone, and piroxantrone, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant, but this study was not designed to compare survival. In general, toxicity was manageable. With premedication, no anaphylaxis was observed with taxol. The most common toxic effects were leukopenia with taxol or piroxantrone treatment and thromboembolic complications with merbarone. Death directly related to treatment occurred in 4% (one patient), 11.4% (four), and 5% (two) of the assessable patients receiving taxol, merbarone, and piroxantrone, respectively. Cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity occurred only occasionally in all three arms.
On the basis of the response rate (20.8% partial response) and 1-year survival rate (41.7%), taxol is an active agent for the treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Merbarone and piroxantrone are relatively inactive.
Further study of taxol is warranted. In future studies, taxol should be combined with other agents, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor should be used to ameliorate myelosuppression.
Eleven patients who developed thromboembolic complications while receiving heparin were studied for a possible adverse reaction to heparin as the cause of their progressive thrombosis. Fifteen additional patients who were receiving heparin for recurrent thromboembolism, but who did not develop signs of thrombotic complications, were studied as patient controls. The most significant finding was an abnormal in vitro aggregation response to heparin alone in all of the patients who developed complications who were tested for it (64 percent). None of the patient controls demonstrated this abnormality. In addition, thrombocytopenia was noted in all of the former but in only one of the latter. Results of prothrombin times, fibrinogens and fibrin split products eliminated disseminated intravascular coagulation as the cause of the thrombocytopenia in the majority of cases. Finally, an approach to the early detection of the abnormal heparin response is presented and guidelines for its therapeutic management are recommended.
The acute effects of nifedipine, 10 mg administered sublingually, were studied in 10 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Nifedipine significantly increased cardiac output and reduced systemic vascular resistance. Nifedipine also increased the hepatic venous pressure gradient by 15% (P less than 0.01). Hepatic blood flow and azygos blood flow did not change significantly. It is suggested that nifedipine increases portal pressure and thus may be deleterious to patients with portal hypertension.
One hundred and forty-one investigators from 45 institutions across Canada participated in the phase 4 clinical trial of sufentanil citrate involving 616 patients. All patients were ASA physical status class I, II, or III, undergoing elective, non-cardiac, major surgical procedures. The average duration of surgery was 1.98 hr and mean dosage of sufentanil was 1.24 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1. Supplemental inhalational anaesthesia was administered to 266 patients (43 per cent). Eighty-six patients required naloxone in the immediate postoperative period. Eighty per cent of these patients had received in excess of 1.0 microgram.kg-1.hr-1 of sufentanil. One hundred and twenty-nine adverse reactions were reported as disturbing and possibly drug-related. Profound bradycardia or sinus arrest was reported in four cases and disturbing hypotension in 37. None of these events required termination of the procedure. The induction, maintenance and recovery phases were rated as good or satisfactory by the participating investigators in 94, 92 and 93 per cent of cases respectively.
3 cases of renal toxicity to Rifampicin are reported. All cases recovered following therapy, two required haemodialysis. It is important that cases on Rifampicin be monitored for renal toxicity and appropriate measures taken in time to prevent a fatal outcome, if detected.
Cadmium (Cd) is an environmental and industrial pollutant that affects various organs in humans and animals. A body of evidence has accumulated implicating the free radical generation with subsequent oxidative stress in the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of Cd toxicity. Since kidney is the critical target of Cd toxicity, we carried out this study to investigate the effects of diallyl tetrasulfide (DTS), an organosulfur compound derived from garlic on Cd induced toxicity in the kidney of rats and also in the kidney cell line (vero cells). In experimental rats, subcutaneous administration of Cd (3 mg/kg bw/day) for 3 weeks induced renal damage, which was evident from significantly increased levels of serum urea and creatinine with significant decrease in creatinine clearance. A markedly increased levels of lipid peroxidation markers (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lipid hydroperoxides) and protein carbonyl contents with significant decrease in nonenzymic antioxidants (total sulphydryl groups, reduced glutathione, vitamin C and vitamin E) and enzymic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase) as well as glutathione metabolizing enzymes (glutathione reductase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) were also observed in Cd intoxicated rats. Coadministration of DTS (40 mg/kg bw/day) and Cd resulted in the reversal of the kidney function accompanied by a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation and increase in the antioxidant defense system. In vitro studies with vero cells showed that incubation of DTS (5-50 microg/ml) with Cd (10 microM) significantly reduced the cell death induced by Cd. DTS at 40 microg/ml effectively blocked the cell death and lipid peroxidation induced by Cd (10 microM) indicating its cytoprotective property. Further, the flow cytometric assessment on the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species using a fluorescent probe 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) confirmed the Cd induced intracellular oxidative stress in vero cells, which was significantly suppressed by DTS (40 microg/ml). The histopathological studies in the kidney of rats also showed that DTS (40 mg/kg bw/day) markedly reduced the toxicity of Cd and preserved the architecture of renal tissue. The present study suggests that the cytoprotective potential of DTS in Cd toxicity might be due to its antioxidant and metal chelating properties, which could be useful for achieving optimum effects in Cd induced renal damage.
A 74-year-old patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease was evaluated for unintended sleep episodes that occurred after long-term treatment with 400 mg/day of L-dopa. Overnight sleep studies and multiple sleep latency testing were carried out under double-blind administration of either L-dopa or placebo. Mean sleep latency with L-dopa was 7 minutes, in contrast to a normal value of 19 minutes, 25 seconds with placebo. The authors' results suggest that L-dopa may cause daytime somnolence in some patients with Parkinson's disease.
The tissue sclerosis found in epilepsy of limbic origin is characterized by shrunken gliotic hippocampus, granule cell loss in the dentate gyrus and extensive pyramidal cell loss in Ammon's horn. Evidence has indicated that sprouting of dentate granule cell axons into the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus is related to hyperexcitability. Trying to understand the role of kinin B1 and B2 receptors in the physiopathology of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the present work was delineated to study the development of the epilepsy model induced by pilocarpine in B1 and B2 knockout mice (B1KO and B2KO, respectively). Behavior parameters, cell death and mossy fiber sprouting were analyzed. B1KO mice showed increased latency for the first seizure, associated to a decreased frequency of spontaneous seizures, when compared with wild-type mice. In addition, B1KO mice showed less cell death in all hippocampal formation associated to a reduced grade of mossy fiber sprouting. Furthermore, B2KO mice presented minor duration of the silent period and an increased frequency of spontaneous seizures, when compared with wild-type mice. B2KO and their control lineage showed similar pattern of cell death in the hippocampus, which was very intense when compared with saline-treated animals. The mossy fiber sprouting was also increased in B2KO mice, when compared to wild-type mice and saline-treated animals. Taken together, these data suggest a deleterious effect for kinin B1 receptor and a protective effect for kinin B2 receptor during the development of the temporal lobe epilepsy.
In the present studies we examined the effects of an intra-peritoneal injection of morphine (7 mg/kg) on carrageenan-induced paw oedema in mice. Carrageenan-induced paw oedema was measured by mercury plethysmometer and was maximal at hour 3, and pretreatment with morphine could reduce the oedema significantly. At the same time the serum levels of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) were increased. Pretreatment with naloxone and dexamethasone abolished morphine anti-inflammatory while decreasing IL-1 alpha serum levels, significantly. These findings suggest that an increase in serum levels of IL-1 alpha plays an important role in the anti-inflammatory effect of morphine.
The objective was to investigate cardiovascular complications in long-term survivors treated by high-dose chemotherapy. We analyzed 13 previously successfully treated metastatic germ cell cancer patients. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 38 years (median: 27 years). Patients were treated by high-dose ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (ICE) or high-dose etoposide, ifosfamide and cisplatin (VIP). In a minimal follow-up of 48 months, the incidence of cardiovascular events and the accumulated doses of platinum were analyzed from the total amounts of cisplatin and/or carboplatin. The calculated accumulated doses of platinum ranged from 487 to 4302 mg (median: 2297 mg). Cardiovascular events were observed in two patients who received cumulative doses of more than 3000 mg of platinum. Survivors of high-dose chemotherapy may have a risk of developing cardiovascular complications during the early phase of follow-up. In particular, patients who have received carboplatin-based high dose chemotherapy require careful observation.
A glutamic acid at residue 69(Glu(69)) in the HLA-DPB1 gene (Glu(69)) is associated with chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and possibly beryllium sensitization (BeS). This study tested the hypothesis that MHC class II polymorphisms are important in susceptibility to BeS and CBD and that the Glu(69) variant is related to markers of disease severity. Genomic DNA was obtained from BeS (n = 50), CBD (n = 104), and beryllium-exposed nondiseased (Be-nondiseased) (n = 125) subjects. HLA-DPB1, -DRB1, and -DQB1 genotypes were determined by (sequence-specific primers) PCR. Disease severity was assessed by pulmonary function and exercise testing. A higher frequency of the DPB1 Glu(69) gene was found in CBD and BeS compared with the Be-nondiseased subjects, with odds ratios of 10.1 for CBD vs Be-nondiseased and 9.5 for BeS vs Be-nondiseased. The majority of BeS and CBD subjects displayed non-0201 Glu(69) alleles. Glu(69) homozygosity was higher in the CBD subjects, while BeS subjects were intermediate and Be-nondiseased lowest. DRB1*01 and DQB1*05 phenotypes were reduced in CBD vs Be-nondiseased subjects, while DRB1*13 and DQB1*06 were associated with CBD in the absence of Glu(69). Markers of disease severity, including a lower forced vital capacity, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, PaO(2) at rest, maximum workload on exercise testing, and a higher arterial-alveolar gradient at rest, were associated with Glu(69) homozygosity. We conclude that DPB1 Glu69 is a marker of sensitization and not specific for disease. Glu(69) homozygosity acts as a functional marker associated with markers of CBD severity.
Tibolone is a synthetic steroid with tissue-specific estrogenic, progestogenic, and androgenic properties. The drug relieves climacteric symptoms and prevents osteoporosis but does not stimulate the endometrium. We have previously shown that in laboratory animals tibolone inhibits the atherogenesis induced by a high-cholesterol diet. Therefore, we compared the antiatherosclerotic effect of oral tibolone at different dose levels with that of oral 17beta-estradiol (E2) and ethinyl estradiol (EE).
Atherosclerotic lesion formation (increase in vessel wall cholesterol deposition and fatty streak formation) was measured in ovariectomized rabbits after 20 weeks on an atherogenic diet (fed daily 80 g of a rabbit chow containing 0.4% cholesterol, 3.75% peanut oil, and 3.75% coconut oil) in eight groups: group 1, placebo (n = 35); group 2, control (n = 34) received normal rabbit chow; group 3, E2 group (E2 4 mg, n = 12); group 4, EE group (EE 60 microg, n = 10); and groups 5-8, tibolone (6 mg, n = 12; 2 mg, n = 13; 0.6 mg, n = 25; and 0.15 mg, n = 11, respectively). During the study, blood samples were obtained for the evaluation of plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, lipoproteins, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase. After 20 weeks, the animals were killed, and cholesterol concentration and the formation of fatty streaks in the wall of the aortic arch were evaluated.
In the placebo group, the atherogenic diet induced a mean increase in total plasma cholesterol concentration from 1.1+/-0.1 mmol/L (control group) to 34.1+/-1.8 mmol/L (mean +/- SE). This resulted in an accumulation of cholesterol in the aortic arch from 48+/-4 (control group) to 608+/-44 nmol/mg protein and in the formation of fatty streaks (41.8+/-3.2% of the surface of the aortic arch was covered with fatty streaks). Tibolone had strong dose-dependent antiatherosclerotic effects. It reduced the accumulation of cholesterol in the aortic arch at doses of 6 to 0.15 mg by 99, 97, 87, and 57% and the formation of fatty streaks by 98, 97, 81, and 38%, respectively. E2 had only a marginal antiatherosclerotic effect, whereas EE showed an effect comparable to that of tibolone at doses of 2 to 0.6 mg. With EE, the accumulation of cholesterol in the vessel wall was reduced by 93% and the formation of fatty streaks by 73%. Mean plasma cholesterol concentrations were also reduced by tibolone (64, 70, 61, and 47%) and EE (57%). This reduction was mainly mediated via a reduction in beta-very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Analysis, however, indicated that the observed antiatherosclerotic effects of tibolone and EE, at least partly, are due to a direct effect on the vessel wall and independent of the changes in plasma cholesterol. At equipotent antiatherosclerotic doses, EE showed a stronger uterotropic effect (measured as the increase in uterine weight) than tibolone. EE increased uterine weight from 0.57 g/kg body weight (BW) (control group) to 3.5 g/kg BW; tibolone at doses of 6, 2, 0.6, and 0.15 mg increased uterine weight to 2.5, 2.8, 2.2, and 1.3 g/kg BW, respectively.
Tibolone can protect the arterial vessel wall against atherosclerotic lesions induced by a hypercholesterolemic diet. However, it has much less estrogenic effects on the uterus compared with EE at equipotent doses, indicating tissue selectivity for tibolone. The clinical implications of these findings require investigation.
The records of 19,082 patients with non-uroepithelial cancers were reviewed to determine the incidence of de novo bladder cancer in patients treated with cyclophosphamide versus patients not treated with this drug. A 9-fold increased incidence of bladder cancer was found in the cyclophosphamide-treated group.
