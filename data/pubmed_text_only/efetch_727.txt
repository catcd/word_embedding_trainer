The authors conducted a 2003-2007 case-control study including 184 cases and 194 controls to examine the association between blood lead and the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) among US veterans and to explore the influence on this association of bone turnover and genetic factors related to lead toxicokinetics. Blood lead, plasma biomarkers of bone formation (procollagen type 1 amino-terminal peptide (PINP)) and resorption (C-terminal telopeptides of type 1 collagen (CTX)), and the K59N polymorphism in the delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase gene, ALAD, were measured. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of blood lead with ALS were estimated with unconditional logistic regression after adjustment for age and bone turnover. Blood lead levels were higher among cases compared with controls (P < 0.0001, age adjusted). A doubling of blood lead was associated with a 1.9-fold increased risk of ALS (95% confidence interval: 1.3, 2.7) after adjustment for age and CTX. Additional adjustment for PINP did not alter the results. Significant lead-ALS associations were observed in substrata of PINP and CTX levels. The K59N polymorphism in the ALAD gene did not modify the lead-ALS association (P = 0.32). These results extend earlier findings by accounting for bone turnover in confirming the association between elevated blood lead level and higher risk of ALS.
Vinyl carbamate epoxide (VCO) was found to possess strong electrophilic, mutagenic and carcinogenic activities. It reacted with water at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4 (phosphate buffer) to form glycolaldehyde and several related reducing compounds; none of these products were mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium TA1535. Under these conditions VCO had a half-life (determined chemically and mutagenically) of approximately 10.5 min. This half-life was progressively lowered by increasing concentrations of chloride ion (liver, serum and isotonic levels). This ion reacted with VCO to form chloroacetaldehyde. VCO also reacted with other nucleophiles such as glutathione, DNA and its constituent guanine and adenine bases. The purine adducts formed by VCO in DNA in vitro and in vivo were released by weak acid treatment and consisted of 7-(2'-oxoethyl)guanine and N2,3-ethenoguanine as major products with 1,N6-ethenoadenine as a minor product. VCO was a strong direct mutagen in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 and TA100 but was only weakly active in the TA98 mutant. VCO was a stronger initiator of carcinogenesis in the skin of CD-1 mice and in the liver of infant male B6C3F1 mice than its metabolic precursors vinyl carbamate (VC) and ethyl carbamate (EC). Unlike VC and EC, VCO was a strong complete carcinogen in the skin of CD-1 mice and induced papillomas and carcinomas following repetitive administration of sub-ulcerogenic doses. VCO also exhibited some carcinogenic activity in the lungs of mice and in the s.c. and mammary tissue of female Sprague-Dawley rats. These data and those from other recent studies support the conclusion that VCO is a major strong electrophilic, mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolite of EC and VC in the mouse.
Although it has been shown that gene therapy is capable of inducing neovascularization in ischemic myocardium, the functional significance of such therapeutic angiogenesis remains less certain. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an experimental link could be made between the ability of a novel fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) gene formulation to promote neovascularization, and its ability to restore myocardial function.
Fibroblast growth factor 2 gene was delivered by means of an adenovirus vector formulated in a collagen-based matrix to provide localized and sustained gene activity. Using a model of chronic myocardial ischemia, animals were randomized to either treatment of the ischemic area by injections of adenovirus vector-FGF2 or no treatment. Left ventricular function was assessed by rest and dobutamine stress echocardiography as well as contrast-enhanced and cine magnetic resonance imaging scans. Studies were repeated 6 weeks after treatment. Arteriogenesis was assessed by quantifying the total arteriolar wall area present in treated areas, using anti-alpha-actin immunohistochemistry and subsequent morphometric analyses.
Echocardiographic results demonstrated a significant restoration of myocardial function in FGF2 gene-treated areas as measured by myocardial wall thickening (0.38 +/- 0.08 cm pretreatment versus 0.76 +/- 0.09 cm posttreatment; p < 0.05). This was demonstrated by comparing the ischemic zones of FGF2 gene-treated versus control-treated animals, as well as by comparing ischemic with nonischemic zones in individual animals This functional improvement was confirmed by cine magnetic resonance imaging, in which 68% (147 of 216) of the treated segments showed improvement in wall motion and there was no change in the untreated segments. Fibroblast growth factor 2 gene treatment also enhanced arteriogenesis within the ischemic zone, as FGF2 gene-treated animals showed a 340% increase in the total arteriolar wall area present versus control-treated animals.
The function of ischemic myocardium can be restored by a novel FGF2 gene delivery method using a gene-activated matrix. The increased arteriogenesis as a result of FGF2 gene therapy leads to restoration of this myocardial function.
More than a quarter of the human population is likely infected with soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura) in highly endemic areas. Preventive chemotherapy is the mainstay of control, but only 4 drugs are available: albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, and pyrantel pamoate.
To assess the efficacy of single-dose oral albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, and pyrantel pamoate against A lumbricoides, hookworm, and T trichiura infections.
A systematic search of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, the World Health Organization library database, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1960 to August 2007).
From 168 studies, 20 randomized controlled trials were included.
Information on study year and country, sample size, age of study population, mean infection intensity before treatment, diagnostic method used, time between evaluations before and after treatment, cure rate (the percentage of individuals who became helminth egg negative following treatment with an anthelminthic drug), egg reduction rate, adverse events, and trial quality was extracted. Relative risk, including a 95% confidence interval (CI), was used to measure the effect of the drugs on the risk of infection prevalence with a random-effects model.
Single-dose oral albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate for infection with A lumbricoides resulted in cure rates of 88% (95% CI, 79%-93%; 557 patients), 95% (95% CI, 91%-97%; 309 patients), and 88% (95% CI, 79%-93%; 131 patients), respectively. Cure rates for infection with T trichiura following treatment with single-dose oral albendazole and mebendazole were 28% (95% CI, 13%-39%; 735 patients) and 36% (95% CI, 16%-51%; 685 patients), respectively. The efficacy of single-dose oral albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate against hookworm infections was 72% (95% CI, 59%-81%; 742 patients), 15% (95% CI, 1%-27%; 853 patients), and 31% (95% CI, 19%-42%; 152 patients), respectively. No pooled relative risks could be calculated for pyrantel pamoate against T trichiura and levamisole for any of the parasites investigated.
Single-dose oral albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate show high cure rates against A lumbricoides. For hookworm infection, albendazole was more efficacious than mebendazole and pyrantel pamoate. Treatment of T trichiura with single oral doses of current anthelminthics is unsatisfactory. New anthelminthics are urgently needed.
A 52-year-old female was hospitalized with malaise, pruritus, jaundice, abdominal discomfort and vomiting. For 20 weeks she had been taking enalapril (Reniten) for hypertension. Serum aminotransferases and bilirubin were highly elevated with prolonged thromboplastin time. There was no evidence for extrahepatic cholestasis in ultrasonography. Serological investigations for a viral etiology of the liver failure were negative and the patient had no risk factors for viral hepatitis or exposure to hepatotoxic substances. Liver puncture revealed hepatitis of the fulminant viral hepatitis type, a picture that can be seen in a drug-induced hepatitis. The complete recovery of liver function after cessation of enalapril administration suggests acute toxic hepatitis due to enalapril. A metabolically mediated idiosyncratic reaction is the most plausible. Potential mechanisms of enalapril-induced hepatotoxicity are discussed and the current literature is surveyed.
Capecitabine is an antineoplastic agent used for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors (breast and colon). Different adverse effects have been recognized, among which we find the muco-cutaneous ones and, specifically, hyperpigmentation. We report a case of localized cutaneous hyperpigmentation secondary to capecitabine in a woman that underwent surgery for breast cancer and was receiving this drug for a month. The start of therapy was associated with dysesthesias and hyperpigmentation of the hands and feet. The pathogenesis of such manifestations is unknown. Other reported cutaneous adverse effects associated with this drug involve the nails producing onycholysis, fragility, discoloration and dystrophy.
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) has been associated with hemolytic anemia in patients deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD). The effect of a daily dose of SMZ of 50 mg/kg was evaluated in a double-blinded study that compared vancomycin with TMP-SMZ given intravenously for treatment of serious Staphylococcus aureus infections. Levels of G-6-PD were determined when patients entered the trial. Most patients were black Americans. G-6-PD-deficient patients were followed serially, with determinations of hemoglobin, haptoglobin, and bilirubin levels, reticulocyte count, and urinalysis. Pretherapy hemoglobin levels were compared with levels during and after therapy. One hundred patients were divided into four groups: group A comprised G-6-PD-deficient patients receiving TMP-SMZ (n = 20); group B, G-6-PD-deficient patients receiving vancomycin (n = 25); and groups C and D, patients with normal G-6-PD levels receiving TMP-SMZ (n = 24) and vancomycin (n = 31), respectively. Groups were comparable in terms of age of patients and duration of therapy. Hemolysis did not occur in any patient receiving TMP-SMZ and occurred in only one patient receiving vancomycin. Both this study and published reports indicate that TMP-SMZ rarely causes hemolysis in a G-6-PD-deficient population.
Although resveratrol (RES) is implicated in the regulation of insulin sensitivity in rodents, the exact mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. Therefore, we sought to investigate how RES affects skeletal muscle lipid transportation and lipid oxidation of subsarcolemmal (SS) and intermyofibrillar (IMF) mitochondrial populations in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR) rats. Systemic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity together with expressions of several genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis and skeletal muscle lipid transportation was studied in rats fed a normal diet, an HFD, and an HFD with intervention of RES for 8 weeks. Citrate synthase (CS), electron transport chain (ETC) activities, and several enzymes for mitochondrial β-oxidation were assessed in SS and IMF mitochondria from tibialis anterior muscle. The HFD-fed rats exhibited obvious systemic and skeletal muscle IR as well as intramuscular lipid accumulation. SIRT1 activity and expression of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis were greatly declined, whereas the gene for lipid transportation, FAT/CD36, was upregulated (P < .05). Subsarcolemmal but not IMF mitochondria displayed lower CS, ETC, and β-oxidation activities. By contrast, RES treatment protected rats against diet-induced intramuscular lipid accumulation and IR, increased SIRT1 activity and mitochondrial biogenesis, and reverted the decline in SS mitochondrial CS and ETC activities. Importantly, although expression of FAT/CD36 was increased (11%, P < .05), activities of SS mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes were largely enhanced (41%~67%, P < .05). This study suggests that RES ameliorates insulin sensitivity consistent with an improved balance between skeletal muscle lipid transportation and SS mitochondrial β-oxidation in HFD rats.
ADAMTS1 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs) is an extracellular matrix metalloproteinase with protease activity and antiangiogenic activity. It has been suggested that ADAMTS1 plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis. In this study, we examined ADAMTS1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and we also evaluated whether the loss of ADAMTS1 expression is due to aberrant methylation of the gene. In addition, we examined the relationship between ADAMTS1 methylation and clinicopathologic features in NSCLC patients. ADAMTS1 expression was examined using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the methylation status of the gene was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR in NSCLC cell lines (n=10) and primary NSCLC tumors (n=98). Down-regulation of ADAMTS1 was observed in 30% (3/10) of the NSCLC cell lines, and this down-regulation was found to be concordant with aberrant methylation of the gene. Furthermore, ADAMTS1 expression was restored after treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, in cell lines that lacked ADAMTS1 expression. Aberrant methylation of the gene was observed in 31.6% (31 of 98) of the NSCLC tumors, while it was found in only 7.1% (7/98) of the corresponding nonmalignant tissues. Methylation in NSCLC tumors was not correlated with the clinicopathologic features of the patients, such as age, gender, and histology and pathologic staging of the tumor. Taken together, these results suggest that aberrant methylation of ADAMTS1 frequently occurs in NSCLCs and that it may play a role in the pathogenesis of NSCLC.
The present study was designed to evaluate the regional vascular profile of milrinone in the setting of experimental heart failure. Utilizing the rat model of myocardial infarction and failure (average infarct size 28%), we measured cardiac output (CO), arterial pressure (MAP), LVEDP, heart rate and systemic vascular resistance, as well as regional blood flow (radioactive microspheres 15 +/- 5 microns) before and after milrinone i.v. (20 microns/kg bolus, 3 micrograms/kg/min infusion) in the conscious state (LVEDP 22 mm Hg versus 10 mm Hg in the sham-operated group, p less than 0.01). Similarly, central hemodynamics and regional blood flow were determined before and after dobutamine or captopril, administering equipotent doses. Milrinone reduced LVEDP more than dobutamine, both more than captopril; MAP was decreased by captopril only. Although all three drugs reduced SVR to a similar extent and increased CO, a quite different blood flow distribution occurred. Improvement in flow to skeletal muscle and splanchnic circulatory bed was exerted by milrinone only. Thus, milrinone attenuated the vasoconstriction in those circulations known to be impaired in heart failure. In contrast to captopril, the effects of milrinone on renal perfusion were modest. These results demonstrate the potent vasodilator activity of milrinone, which is independent of its direct-positive inotropic effects, being most prominent in the splanchnic, coronary and skeletal muscle circulation. The latter might have clinical relevance since improved muscular flow during exercise is likely to improve exercise capacity in heart failure after long-term treatment.
We investigated the antioxidant potential of gallic acid (GA), a natural compound found in vegetal sources, on the motor and oxidative damages induced by lead. Rats exposed to lead (50 mg/kg, i.p., once a day, 5 days) were treated with GA (13.5mg/kg, p.o.) or EDTA (110 mg/kg, i.p.) daily, for 3 days. Lead exposure decreased the locomotor and exploratory activities, reduced blood ALA-D activity, and increased brain catalase (CAT) activity without altering other antioxidant defenses. Brain oxidative stress (OS) estimated by lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and protein carbonyl were increased by lead. GA reversed the motor behavior parameters, the ALA-D activity, as well as the markers of OS changed by lead exposure. CAT activity remained high, possibly as a compensatory mechanism to eliminate hydroperoxides during lead poisoning. EDTA, a conventional chelating agent, was not beneficial on the lead-induced motor behavior and oxidative damages. Both GA (less) and EDTA (more) reduced the lead accumulation in brain tissue. Negative correlations were observed between the behavioral parameters and lipid peroxidation and the lead levels in brain tissue. In conclusion, GA may be an adjuvant in lead exposure, mainly by its antioxidant properties against the motor and oxidative damages resulting from such poisoning.
Cyproterone acetate (CPA), an active component of certain contraceptive and antiandrogenic drugs, has been shown recently to induce DNA repair synthesis in rat hepatocytes in vitro. In the present study we examined whether CPA can cause the formation of DNA adducts detectable by the 32P-postlabeling technique in hepatic cells in vitro and in vivo. Incubation of primary cultures of hepatocytes from male Wistar rats with CPA resulted in the occurrence of radioactive spots in the radiochromatograms of 32P-postlabeled DNA digests indicating the formation of two DNA adducts ('A' and 'B'). At 30 microM CPA, the highest concentration tested, approximately 50 'A' adducts and five 'B' adducts were found per 10(9) nucleotides. DNA of hepatocyte cultures from female rats was found to contain adduct A and a minor adduct termed 'D', but adduct B was not observed. Between 1 and 10 microM CPA, the relative level of adduct A was approximately 20-fold higher than the level observed in male hepatocytes. In vivo DNA adducts were detected almost exclusively in hepatic DNA. Hepatic DNA from male Wistar rats treated with single doses of CPA (1-100 mg/kg) by gavage, showed the major adducts A and B and two further spots of minor intensity ('C' and 'D') in the radiochromatograms. No adducts were detectable in extrahepatic tissues. The adduct pattern of liver DNA from females exposed to single oral doses between 0.1 and 30 mg CPA/kg body wt was similar to that observed in males; however, the relative levels for adducts A and D were approximately 100-fold higher. In females, linear relationships between dose and adduct levels were observed for all four adducts. The present findings show that CPA causes damage to hepatic DNA not only in vitro, but also in vivo. Thus it appears possible that DNA adduct formation is involved in the formation of hepatic tumors during long-term treatment of rats with the synthetic steroid.
In this report, we will describe the occurrence of intravascular immune haemolytic anaemia (IHA) associated with ceftriaxone and/or its metabolites in two of our patients. Serological examinations were carried out to demonstrate and characterise the causative antibodies. The findings of all previously reported cases will also be discussed.
Direct antiglobulin tests (DAT) and indirect antiglobulin tests were performed according to standard procedures. Tests for drug-dependent antibodies were performed in the presence and absence of the target drugs and their ex vivo antigens (in the urine of patients treated with the drugs).
Ceftriaxone-related haemolysis resulted in the death of one of our patients (patient 2), and caused acute renal failure in the other (patient 1). The DATwas strongly positive for anti-C3d and anti-IgG in one case (patient 2), and for anti-C3d alone in the other (patient 1). The serum of patient 1 reacted with red blood cells only in the presence of ex vivo antigens, while that of patient 2 reacted positively to native ceftriaxone and its ex vivo antigen. In the latter patient, the antibodies appeared to cross-react with native cefotaxime whereas, in the first patient, they weakly cross-reacted only with the ex vivo antigens of cefotaxime and cefpodoxime proxetil.
Ceftriaxone and/or its trace metabolites may induce life-threatening IHA in children and adults. Serological work-up must include tests to determine the cross-reactivity of ceftriaxone-dependent antibodies to avoid immune haemolysis due to administration of structurally related cephalosporins in affected patients.
Cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) catalyzes the initial step in the biosynthesis of neurosteroids within the brain. We sought to determine which cells express P450cc and whether neurosteroids play a role in the regulation of epileptogenesis following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE).
Rats experienced uninterrupted SE or SE terminated with diazepam at 60, 120, and 180 min. P450scc induction in CA3 hippocampus was determined by double immunolabeling with P450scc antiserum and monoclonal antibodies against GFAP (astrocytes), RIP (oligodendrocytes), or heme oxygenase-1 (microglia).
SE was associated with P450scc induction in many astrocytes and a small number of microglia and oligodendrocytes in the hippocampal CA3 strata radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare. The extent of P450scc induction increased with increasing SE duration. Paradoxically, increased P450scc induction in rats experiencing SE for 180 min or more was associated with the delayed onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Treatment with the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride (100 mg/kg/day for 25 days), which inhibits the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor modulating neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone, was associated with a significant reduction in time to the onset of spontaneous seizures in rats exposed to 180-min but not 90-min SE.
P450scc is induced by SE in a diverse population of hippocampal glia. Induction of P450scc is associated with the delayed onset of spontaneous seizures. Conversely, inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis accelerated the onset of spontaneous seizures, but only in animals exhibiting significant increases in P450scc. These findings suggest that induction of neurosteroid synthesis in reactive glial cells is associated with delayed onset of spontaneously recurrent seizures.
Drugs that act on the serotoninergic system have been shown to influence the pupil size. However, the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor type or subtype that affects pupil diameter has not been defined in humans. With a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized design, we investigated in healthy volunteers the effect on pupil size of buspirone and sumatriptan, which mainly act on 5-HT1A- and the 5-HT1-like receptors, respectively.
The pupil area was measured by means of a videopupillometer before and after a single oral administration of placebo or of three different doses of active drugs. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were recorded after pupil area measurement.
Buspirone (5, 10, and 20 mg) caused a dose-dependent miosis. Sumatriptan (50, 100, and 200 mg) did not affect the pupil size. Twenty milligrams of buspirone reduced the mydriasis induced by pretreatment with homatropine eyedrops. A 20 mg dose of buspirone reduced blood pressure without change in heart rate, whereas buspirone, at doses lower than 20 mg, and sumatriptan did not affect heart rate and blood pressure.
This study suggests that buspirone, but not sumatriptan, the selective agonist of 5-HT1-like receptors, causes miosis in humans by activation of 5-HT1A receptors, possibly located in the central nervous system where they inhibit iris sympathetic pathways. Measurement of pupil size seems to provide a valuable and sensitive index of 5-HT1A receptor function in humans.
Onychomycosis is the most frequent cause of nail disease and represents 30% of all mycotic infections of the skin.
Our purpose was to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of intermittent dosing of itraconazole ("pulse therapy") with placebo in fingernail onychomycosis.
Seventy-three patients with clinically and mycologically diagnosed fingernail onychomycosis were randomly selected to receive itraconazole, 200 mg twice daily, or placebo for the first week of each month for 2 consecutive months; patients were observed for 19 weeks. Seventy-one patients received the study medication and were included in the safety analysis. Efficacy of treatment was evaluated in 46 patients.
A significantly greater proportion of itraconazole-treated patients than placebo-treated patients achieved clinical success (77% vs 0%), mycologic success (73% vs 13%), and overall success (68% vs 0%). No itraconazole-treated patient had a clinical or mycologic relapse during the follow-up period. Ten itraconazole-treated patients (28%) and nine placebo-treated patients (26%) had adverse events. Three patients discontinued treatment for safety reasons.
Pulse therapy with itraconazole for 2 consecutive months produces significantly greater clinical, mycologic, and overall success than placebo. Short-term itraconazole pulse therapy for fingernail onychomycosis is effective and well tolerated.
Two cases are described who developed epileptic seizures whilst taking maprotiline hydrochloride in therapeutic dosage. In both cases the electroencephalogram was normal and the fits stopped on withdrawal of the drug.
Found in inflammatory zone (FIZZ)1, also known as resistin-like molecule alpha, belongs to a novel class of cysteine-rich secreted protein family, named FIZZ/resistin-like molecule, with unique tissue expression patterns. FIZZ1 is induced in alveolar type II epithelial cells (AECs) in bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis, and found to induce myofibroblast differentiation in vitro. The objective of this study was to elucidate the regulation of AEC FIZZ1 expression in pulmonary fibrosis. AECs were isolated from rat lungs and the effects of a number of cytokines on FIZZ1 expression were evaluated by RT-PCR. Of all cytokines examined, only IL-4 and IL-13 were effective in stimulating FIZZ1 expression in AECs. Stimulation by IL-4/IL-13 was accompanied by increases in phosphorylated STAT6 and JAK1. FIZZ1 expression was also stimulated by transfection with a STAT6 expression plasmid, but was inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides directed against STAT6. In vivo studies showed that compared with wild-type controls, both IL-4- and IL-13-deficient mice showed reduced BLM-induced lung FIZZ1 expression and fibrosis, which were essentially abolished in IL-4 and IL-13 doubly deficient mice. Furthermore, STAT6-deficient mice showed marked reduction in BLM-induced lung FIZZ1 expression. Thus, IL-4 and IL-13 are potent inducers of AEC FIZZ1 expression via STAT6 and play key roles in BLM-induced lung FIZZ1 expression and fibrosis. This represents a potential mechanism by which IL-4/IL-13 could play a role in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis.
An unusual case of urinary retention is reported occurring during the inpatient rehabilitation of minimally responsive state (MRS) following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Urodynamic evaluation showed detrusor acontractility and subsequent management involved intermittent bladder catheterization and treatment of a single urinary tract infection.
Factors contributing to her bladder paralysis included severe immobility, tetraplegia and treatment of diffuse spasticity with oral Dantrolene sodium 250 mg per day. Constipation, diabetes and spinal cord injury were absent. In addition, she received unilateral partial sciatic neurolysis with 50% alcohol for severe knee flexor spasticity and intra-muscular Botulinum toxin A to both spastic upper limbs.
Bladder acontractility resolved completely when Dantrolene was reduced with subsequent achievement of a catheter-free status and small post-void residual volumes. Repeat urodynamics showed spontaneous detrusor contractions.
A discussion of possible aetiologic factors for detrusor acontracility following TBI is presented including a brief review of the literature.
Recently, there have been report sleep attacks in parkinsonian patients as a side effect of pramipexole and ropinirole. We report a patient with similar episodes related with pergolide.
A 64 year old man with rigid akinetic parkinsonism, treated with carbidopa/levodopa and pergolide, developed sudden, irresistible sleep episodes after increasing the dose of pergolide to 2.25 mg/day because of bad control of parkinsonian symptoms. These episodes started 30 minutes after each dose of pergolide and lasted 2 hours. Following reduction of the dose of pergolide to 1.5 mg/day the sleep episodes disappeared. Two double blind multiple sleep latency tests were performed, one after intaking pergolide and other after intaking placebo.
The latencies to sleep onset were lower with pergolide than with placebo, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. There was no premature REM sleep onset.
Sleep episodes are likely a not specific effect of dopamine agonists
We present the case of a 32-year-old male who suffered from severe RA from the age of 21 years. After 9 years of active disease and poor response to therapy the patient developed severe hepatitis induced by the NSAID pirprofen. He went into fulminant hepatic failure necessitating emergency liver transplantation. Liver transplantation was followed by clinical and laboratory remission of his RA and he has remained virtually asymptomatic for more than 3.5 years. The possibility that this favourable clinical course was due to the immunosuppressive effect of the liver transplant rather than the ensuing immunosuppressive therapy is discussed.
