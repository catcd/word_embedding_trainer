Relapse to drug use after periods of forced or self-imposed abstinence is a central problem in the treatment of addiction; therefore, identification of factors modulating the risk to relapse is a relevant goal of preclinical research.
These experiments evaluated the influence of the amount of drug experienced, the duration of drug withdrawal, and individual liability on the propensity to cocaine-induced reinstatement of conditioned place preference (CPP).
Mice from the inbred strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J were trained for CPP with a high (20 mg/kg) or low (5 mg/kg) effective dose of cocaine. After CPP testing, all groups underwent extinction. Twenty-four hours after the extinction test, mice were challenged with saline, a cocaine dose unable to induce CPP (2.5 mg/kg) or an intermediate effective dose (10 mg/kg), and tested for CPP reinstatement. Additional groups of mice trained with the low cocaine dose were left undisturbed for 8 days after extinction test (long withdrawal), retested for extinction, and evaluated for prime-induced reinstatement (0, 2.5, 10 mg/kg of cocaine).
Mice trained with the high cocaine dose, but not with the low one, showed prime-induced reinstatement 24 h after the extinction test; DBA/2J mice trained with the low dose showed reinstatement after long withdrawal.
These results indicate that reinstatement of CPP by cocaine prime depends on the amount of drug experienced and on an interaction between individual liability and duration of drug abstinence and suggest that the risk to relapse into drug seeking is not prevented by moderated drug consumption.
Research is increasingly linking autism spectrum disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders to synaptic abnormalities ("synaptopathies"). PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95, DLG4) orchestrates protein-protein interactions at excitatory synapses and is a major functional bridge interconnecting a neurexinneuroligin-SHANK pathway implicated in autism spectrum disorders.
The authors characterized behavioral, dendritic, and molecular phenotypic abnormalities relevant to autism spectrum disorders in mice with PSD-95 deletion (Dlg4⁻(/)⁻). The data from mice led to the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human DLG4 and the examination of associations between these variants and neural signatures of Williams' syndrome in a normal population, using functional and structural neuroimaging.
Dlg4⁻(/)⁻ showed increased repetitive behaviors, abnormal communication and social behaviors, impaired motor coordination, and increased stress reactivity and anxiety-related responses. Dlg4⁻(/)⁻ had subtle dysmorphology of amygdala dendritic spines and altered forebrain expression of various synaptic genes, including Cyln2, which regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and is a candidate gene for Williams' syndrome. A signifi-cant association was observed between variations in two human DLG4 SNPs and reduced intraparietal sulcus volume and abnormal cortico-amygdala coupling, both of which characterize Williams' syndrome.
These findings demonstrate that DLG4 gene disruption in mice produces a complex range of behavioral and molecular abnormalities relevant to autism spectrum disorders and Williams' syndrome. The study provides an initial link between human DLG4 gene variation and key neural endophenotypes of Williams' syndrome and perhaps corticoamygdala regulation of emotional and social processes more generally.
It has been shown previously that 30-minute infusions of intravenous nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction are able to lower left ventricular filling pressure and improve left ventricular function while lowering mean arterial pressure by only 7 mmHg (0.9 kPa). A decrease in sigmaST in praecordial ST segment mapping studies during nitroglycerin infusion in patients with anterior infarction suggested a decrease in the extent of myocardial ischaemia. In the present study, 30 patients with acute myocardial infarction received 1- to 3-hour infusions of intravenous nitroglycerin at infusion rates sufficient to lower mean arterial pressure by an average of 22 mmHg (2.9 kPa). An improvement in ventricular function was noted in that subgroup of patients with the msot severe left ventricular dysfunction. All patients with anterior myocardial infarction underwent serial ST segment mapping and, irrespective of the presence or absence of left ventricular failure, showed a decrease in sigmaST during nitroglycerin infusion (P less than 0.005). These findings suggest that infusion of nitroglycerin improves left ventricular function and/or alters left ventricular compliance in patients with left ventricular failure complicating myocardial infarction and furthermore decreases sigmaST in all patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of left ventricular failure, suggesting that the extent of myocardial ischaemia is decreased.
Aseptic meningitis is a rare adverse drug reaction, reported with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) and with miscellaneous drugs such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). The most common clinical findings reported are fever, headache, stiffness and altered level of consciousness. We report a case of aseptic meningitis related to TMP-SMX ingestion that caused severe derangements of the patient's vital signs, requiring Intensive Care Unit admittance. The prompt diagnosis and discontinuation of the drug resulted in complete recovery. We examine the case according to the literature on this topic. We conclude that, since the signs and symptoms of this unusual drug reaction may mimic those of central nervous system infection, the clinician should consider this etiology when he is faced with a patient with suspected meningoencephalitis, especially if the latter has already been treated at home with unknown drugs. Further studies should investigate the pathogenetic mechanism of TMP-SMX-induced aseptic meningitis.
Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) is a nucleotide analogue that is known to be effective for lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants as well as wild-type HBV. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of ADV against lamivudine-resistant genotype C HBV mutants.
Thirty-five patients with breakthrough hepatitis due to lamivudine-resistant HBV received ADV 10 mg daily with discontinuation of lamivudine. Quantitative HBV DNA, HBeAg, liver function test including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was checked every 4-12 weeks to evaluate the efficacy of ADV.
ADV was administered for a median of 48 weeks (range: 24-120 weeks). The rate of serum HBV DNA loss was 68.6%, 80.0%, 84.0%, and 88.2% at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48, respectively. The rate of serum HBeAg seroconversion was 8.3% and 14.3% at weeks 24 and 48, respectively. The rate of serum ALT normalization at week 48 was 70.6%. Within 32 weeks after stopping ADV therapy, serum HBV DNA levels increased to a median of 378.9 pg/ml in 88.9% of patients, who were treated for a median of 40 weeks. Moreover, in some patients, the ALT level increased to more than five times the upper limit of normal.
Administration of ADV is an effective option for the treatment of patients with lamivudine-resistant genotype C HBV infection.
NaCl administration enhances HCO3 secretion in the distal tubule of animals with chronic metabolic alkalosis but does not correct the augmented H+ secretion characteristic of this disorder. The present studies used in vivo microperfusion micropuncture to investigate whether combined repletion of K+ and Cl- corrected the augmented H+ secretion in the distal tubule of rats with chronic furosemide-induced metabolic alkalosis. Correction of alkalosis was induced in one group of animals with NaCl and in another group with a similar amount of Cl- as NaCl + KCl for 24 h; each group was compared with animals with maintained alkalosis. Total 24-h urine HCO3 excretion by each Cl(-)-repleted group comprised > or = 70% of the calculated HCO3 loss necessary to induce the respective decrease in plasma total CO2. Alkalotic animals given NaCl+KCl had significantly lower H+ secretion in the distal tubule compared with animals with maintained alkalosis (15.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 34.6 +/- 1.8 pmol.mm-1.min-1, P < 0.01) but those given only NaCl did not (28.3 +/- 1.5 pmol.mm-1.min-1, P = 0.14). H+ secretion was not different among control animals given similar amounts of Na+, K+, and Cl-. These studies demonstrate that Cl- repletion corrects chronic furosemide-induced metabolic alkalosis predominantly by a renal mechanism and that combined administration of K+ and Cl-, but not of Cl- alone, corrects the augmented H+ secretion in the distal tubule in this model of chronic alkalosis.
In 470 consecutively monitored psychiatric inpatients who received chlorpromazine, adverse reactions attributed to the drug were reported in 150 (31.9%); and in three, the reaction was considered life-threatening (0.6%). Reactions were more frequent with higher daily doses and the intramuscular route was associated with earlier onset of a reaction.
Serum neuroleptic levels were measured by radioreceptor assay in patients treated with the antidepressant amoxapine. When compared to standard neuroleptics, amoxapine produced relatively weak neuroleptic activity. Amoxapine dose correlated significantly with serum neuroleptic level. Three of eight patients developed significant extrapyramidal side effects. Neither dose of amoxapine nor neuroleptic level correlated with the presence or severity of EPS.
Doxorubicin (DOX) has a wide spectrum of antitumor activity with dose-related cardiotoxicity as a major side effect. This cardiotoxicity has been suggested to result from the generation of oxygen-free radicals. The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of the antioxidant, thymoquinone (TQ) on cardiotoxicity and antitumor activity of DOX in mice. TQ (8 mg/kg/day, p.o.) administered with drinking water starting 5 days before a single i.p. injection of DOX (20 mg/kg) and continuing during the experimental period ameliorated the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. This finding was evidenced by significant reductions in serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase elevated levels and further supplemented by histopathological examination of cardiac tissue. TQ did not alter the plasma and heart DOX levels as monitored by fluorometric analysis. In in vivo study on mouse Ehrlich ascites carcinoma tumor, it could then be shown that TQ does not interfere with the antitumor activity of DOX. The current data support TQ as a potentially selective cytoprotective agent, which may ameliorate cardiotoxicity without decreasing DOX antitumor activity.
LATS1 and LATS2 are tumor suppressor genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle, but their methylation statuses are still unknown in human astrocytoma. Here, we found that the promoter hypermethylation frequencies of LATS1 and LATS1 were 63.66% (56/88) and 71.5% (63/88) in 88 astrocytomas by methylation-specific PCR. But no methylation of LATS1 and LATS2 promoter was detected in the 10 normal brain tissues. There was an increased methylation frequency of LATS1 and LATS2 with the malignant development of astrcytoma. By real-time PCR, the mRNA expression of LATS1 or LATS2 was detected significantly decreased in different pathological grade astrocytomas (P<0.05). And the mRNA levels of LATS1 and LATS2 in astrocytomas with hypermethylation were both significantly (P<0.01) lower than those without methylation. The methylation of LATS1 and LATS2 was detected in U251 and SHG-44 cell lines, and 5-aza-deoxycytidine could restore their expression to induce cell apoptosis. Our results suggested that LATS1 and LATS2 mRNA was down-regulated in astrocytoma by hypermethylation of the promoter. The methylation and mRNA expression of LATS1 and LATS2 may provide useful clues to the development of the diagnostic assays for astrocytoma. Our results also suggested that LATS1 and LATS2 may be a useful target for astrocytoma therapy.
The overall and age-specific prevalences and multiplicities of spontaneous and chemically induced hepatocellular neoplasia were compared among male B6D2F1, B6C3F1, C3H (C3H/HeNCr1 MTV-), B6CF1, and C57BL/6 (C57BL/6NCr1) mice following a single intraperitoneal injection of 0.03 microM vinyl carbamate (VC)/g body weight or vehicle alone at 15 days of age. Additional groups of B6C3F1, C3H, and C57BL/6 males received 0.15 microM VC/g body weight at 15 days of age. For male B6D2F1, B6C3F1, C3H, B6CF1, and C57BL/6 mice, the estimated overall prevalences (and multiplicities) of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas in vehicle controls were 14.1% (0.19), 12.3% (0.15), 8.2% (0.10), 7.2% (0.09), and 2.4% (0.02), respectively. The analogous estimates in the low-dose group were 59.2% (1.19), 72.9% (4.07), 48.6% (1.99), 22.8% (0.29), and 43.9% (0.82). Analogous estimates for B6C3F1, C3H, and C57BL/6 mice in the high-dose group were 45.3% (4.29), 59.7% (6.63), and 46.8% (1.74), respectively. Age-specific multiplicity estimates suggested a progression from altered hepatocellular foci (AHF) to hepatocellular neoplasms. Further evidence of progression was provided by the temporal occurrence of hepatocellular adenomas before carcinomas, and the apparent origination of carcinomas within adenomas. Pulmonary metastases were observed in many of the mice with hepatocellular carcinomas. These findings confirm previous observations of strain differences in liver neoplasm response, suggest a progressive development from AHF to adenomas, and ultimately to carcinomas, and show sensitivity to VC-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in all 5 strains.
Administration of 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) given before a two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PHx), results in suppression of hepatocyte proliferation and stimulation of oval cell proliferation. Our objective in this study was to examine the oval cell response and associated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene expression by combining 2-AAF with selective hepatic damage caused by either carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) exposure or by PHx. We also examined oval cell response with the above two protocols (2-AAF/CCl4 and 2-AAF/PHx) as affected by previous bile ductular damage caused by 4,4'-methylene dianiline (4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane, DAPM) exposure. DAPM is an aromatic diamine, known to cause bile ductular damage in both humans and animals. Using the protocols of 2-AAF/ CCl4 and 2-AAF/PHx, when DAPM was given 24 hours before the hepatic injury, no oval cell proliferation was seen (histological) and AFP expression was not detected by Northern blot analysis. These results provide direct evidence that oval cells are closely associated with the biliary epithelial cells and supports the theory that hepatic oval cells may originate from cells derived from either intraportal or periportal ductules.
This study examined the response of the Eker rat to nephrotoxic compounds and to genotoxic nonrenal carcinogens. Groups of male Eker rats received either no treatment; a vehicle treatment; treatment with a noncarcinogenic nephrotoxin (aluminum nitrilotriacetate, 2 mg/kg/day of aluminum, intraperitoneally, 3 days per week or cyclosporine A, 30 mg/kg/day, orally by gavage, 7 days/week); or treatment with a genotoxic nonrenal carcinogen (furan, 8 mg/kg/day, orally by gavage, 5 days/week or 2,4-diaminotoluene, 6.5 mg/kg/day, orally by gavage, 7 days/week or 2-nitropropane, 89 mg/kg/day, orally by gavage, 3 days/week). Duration of treatment was 4 and/or 6 months. Tissues from the Eker rats were evaluated microscopically and numbers of proliferative renal lesions were counted. Administration of nephrotoxic compounds (Al-NTA and cyclosporine) significantly increased the number of preneoplastic and neoplastic renal lesions in the Eker rat compared to concurrent vehicle controls. The genotoxic nonrenal carcinogens had no consistent effect on numbers of preneoplastic or neoplastic renal lesions and did not produce neoplasms in the expected target organ (liver).
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as chronic myelogenous (CML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML) are frequently induced by tyrosine kinase oncogenes. Although these MPNs are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, patients often relapse upon withdrawal of therapy. We used a model of MPN, which is induced by co-expression of the oncoproteins HIP1/PDGFβR (H/P) and AML1/ETO from their endogenous loci, to examine the mechanisms of disease development and recurrence following imatinib withdrawal. Although the MPN displayed a full hematologic response to imatinib, 100% of the diseased mice relapsed upon drug withdrawal. MPN persistence was not due to imatinib resistance mutations in the H/P oncogene or massive gene expression changes. Within 1 week of imatinib treatment, more than 98% of gene expression changes induced by the oncogenes in isolated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) immunophenotype) normalized. Supplementation of imatinib with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or arsenic trioxide reduced MPN-initiating cell frequencies and the combination of imatinib with arsenic trioxide cured a large fraction of mice with MPNs. In contrast, no mice in the imatinib-treated control cohorts were cured. These data suggest that treatment with a combination of arsenic trioxide and imatinib can eliminate refractory MPN-initiating cells and reduce disease relapse.
Cytokines as prognostic markers in acute liver failure (ALF) have not been evaluated in the Indian subcontinent with hepatitis E as the commonest aetiological agent. We investigated the clinical significance of proinflammatory/apoptotic cytokines soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in ALF of specific aetiology.
A total of 82 cases, 37 ALF and 45 acute hepatitis (AH), and 60 healthy controls were recruited. Serum levels of sFasL and TNF-alpha were determined at admission and death/recovery.
Mean sFasL and TNF-alpha serum levels at admission were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients with ALF than AH, but no marked difference was observed between ALF-E (expired, n = 23) and ALF-S (survivors, n = 14), although the former had comparatively higher levels. ALF-E had higher than baseline TNF-alpha and sFasL concentrations at death, while in the ALF-S group the samples obtained from the patients as soon as they came out of encephalopathy, showed either lower or similar TNF-alpha and sFasL levels as found at admission.
The high levels of sFasL and TNF-alpha are associated with ALF. Following the trend of these cytokines can be useful in predicting death and timely referral to a transplant centre.
Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) plays complex roles in tumorigenesis, acting as tumor suppressor gene or an oncogene depending on the cellular context. WT1 expression has been variably reported in both benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) by means of immunohistochemistry. The aim of the present study was to characterize its potential pathogenetic role in these relatively uncommon malignant tumors. Firstly, immunohistochemical analyses in MPNST sNF96.2 cell line showed strong WT1 staining in nuclear and perinuclear areas of neoplastic cells. Thus, we investigated the effects of silencing WT1 by RNA interference. Through Western Blot analysis and proliferation assay we found that WT1 knockdown leads to the reduction of cell growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner. siWT1 inhibited proliferation of sNF96.2 cell lines likely by influencing cell cycle progression through a decrease in the protein levels of cyclin D1 and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation compared to the control cells. These results indicate that WT1 knockdown attenuates the biological behavior of MPNST cells by decreasing Akt activity, demonstrating that WT1 is involved in the development and progression of MPNSTs. Thus, WT1 is suggested to serve as a potential therapeutic target for MPNSTs.
Paclitaxel is an anti-neoplastic agent commonly used in the treatment of primary bronchial carcinoma and tumours of the breast and ovary. Its toxicity, haematological and peripheral neuropathy, are well known. On the other hand central nervous system toxicity is rare.
We report a case of acute encephalopathy, occurring eight hours after infusion of Paclitaxel, in a patient treated for adenocarcinoma of the lung. It included drowsiness, confusion and hallucinations, and resolved completely after ten days. The diagnosis of encephalopathy secondary to Paclitaxel injection was reached after exclusion of other possible aetiologies.
Acute encephalopathy is a rare complication of intravenous Paclitaxel treatment. The pathophysiology of this toxic effect is discussed: a direct toxicity of Paclitaxel or of its solvent (polyoxethylated castor oil), and the role of a pre-existing alteration of the blood-brain barrier.
Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or DRESS syndrome is a distinct severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction characterized by skin rash, fever, eosinophilia and visceral involvement. The latter leads to a 10% mortality rate, with interstitial nephritis occurring in about 10% of the cases. The outcome is usually favorable after withdrawal of drug therapy; systemic corticosteroid therapy may hasten the recovery, although there are no data from prospective, randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of this approach. Administration of other immunosuppressive agents (cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine) has also been suggested. We report on a patient with vancomycin-induced DRESS syndrome with acute interstitial nephritis and hepatitis. There was no improvement after withdrawal of the offending agent and empiric corticosteroid use. After tapering the steroids, a five-day course of cyclosporine was followed by quick resolution of the skin rash and recovery of renal function. Cyclosporine could represent a treatment option in cases of severe visceral involvement such as persistent renal insufficiency that do not improve after discontinuation of the offending agent and administration of high doses of steroids.
This longitudinal study investigated the rates of iron-deficiency (ID) and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) among prenatally cocaine-exposed and nonexposed two- and four-year-old children and assessed their relationships to neurodevelopmental outcomes. The sample consisted of 143 two-year-old (70 exposed and 73 nonexposed) and 274 four-year-old (139 exposed and 135 nonexposed) low socioeconomic status children recruited from an ongoing longitudinal study. Hematological assessments included hemoglobin, serum ferritin, mean corpuscular volume, transferrin saturation, and blood lead levels. The neurodevelopmental outcomes consisted of the Bayley Mental (MDI) and Motor (PDI) Development indices at two years, and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence (WPPSI) and the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDMS) at four years. The rate of IDA in four-year-old children was significantly greater among the cocaine-exposed compared to the nonexposed group (p =.026), while the rates at two years were not significant. Exposure to IDA at two years was associated with a significant decrease in concurrent motor scores (p =.011) after adjustment for relevant covariates. Peak exposure to IDA, defined as being anemic at 2 and/or 4 years of age, was associated with a significant (p <.05) decrease in Full Scale IQ after adjustment. Cocaine exposure was not a significant predictor of Full Scale IQ with the inclusion of peak IDA and lead in the model. These findings indicate the need for greater pediatric surveillance of IDA and lead in cocaine-exposed infants, in order to reduce long-term neuropsychological deficits.
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has an important role in the regulation of stress responses and feeding behaviour. There is evidence that some effects elicited by NPY occur due to modulation of action of regular neurotransmitters. The main objective of the present study was to test behavioural effects of the novel neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y(1) receptor antagonist (R)-N-[[4-(aminocarbonylaminomethyl)-phenyl]methyl]-N(2)-(diphe nylacetyl)-argininamide trifluoroacetate (BIBO 3304) on dopamine-dependent behaviour. Intracerebroventricular administration of BIBO 3304 (1, 10, 50 nmol) had no effect on locomotor activity as measured by number of rearings and number of squares visited in an open field test in rats, but at 50 nmol dose defecation was significantly increased. BIBO 3304 (10 nmol) reduced amphetamine-induced increases in horizontal and vertical activity whereas its S-configurated enantiomer BIBO 3457 was inactive. In an open field test BIBO 3304 (10 nmol) inhibited purposeless running in rats sensitized to direct dopaminergic agonist apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.). BIBO 3304 (10 nmol but not 1 nmol, i.c.v.) reduced fighting in apomorphine-induced aggression paradigm. Apomorphine-induced aggression was reduced by another, structurally similar, but less potent NPY Y(1) receptor antagonist BIBP 3226 (10 nmol, i.c.v.). A lower dose of BIBP 3226 (1 nmol, i.c.v.) was inactive. Concomitant administration of BIBO 3304 (10 nmol) with low doses of apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) over the course of 10 days failed to prevent the development of apomorphine-induced aggressiveness. These data demonstrate that behavioural response to indirectly (amphetamine) and directly (apomorphine) acting dopaminergic stimulants is inhibited by NPY Y(1) receptor antagonists and suggest that NPY Y(1) receptor activation might be important in pathophysiology of disorders associated with hyperactivity of dopaminergic pathways, such as psychosis, schizophrenia and drug abuse. We propose that the effects of BIBO 3304 on amphetamine/apomorphine-induced locomotion and apomorphine-induced aggressiveness are due to modulation of postsynaptic dopaminergic responses rather than direct effects of NPY Y(1) receptor antagonists on dopamine or NPY release.
We examined whether 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25 D(3)), the active form of vitamin D involved in the regulation of the immune system, may also protect human pancreatic islet cells from destruction induced by cytokines. In this study, we specifically investigated the effect of 1,25 D(3) on oxidative stress and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) induction, both implicated in cytokine-induced islet cell dysfunction and destruction. We also investigated the effects of 1,25 D(3) on interleukin (IL)-6, a pleiotropic cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of immunoinflammatory disorders. Human pancreatic islets, isolated from heart-beating donors, were treated with a combination of three cytokines, IL-1beta+tumor necrosis factor alpha+interferon gamma, in the presence or absence of vitamin D, and compared with with untreated control cells. Metabolic activity was assessed by cell viability and insulin content. Oxidative stress was estimated by heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) expression, cell manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity and nitrite release, a reflexion of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Variation of immunogenicity of islet preparations was determined by analysis of the MHC class I and class II transcripts. Inflammatory status was evaluated by IL-6 production. After 48 h of contact with cytokines, insulin content was significantly decreased by 40% but cell viability was not altered. MHC expression significantly increased six- to sevenfold as well as NO and IL-6 release (two- to threefold enhancement). MnSOD activity was not significantly induced and hsp70 expression was not affected by the combination of cytokines. The addition of 1,25 D(3) significantly reduced nitrite release, IL-6 production and MHC class I expression which then became not significantly different from controls. These results suggest that the effect of 1,25 D(3) in human pancreatic islets cells may be a reduction of the vulnerability of cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes and a reduction of cytotoxic challenge. Hence, 1,25 D(3) might play a role in the prevention of type 1 diabetes and islet allograft rejection.
We investigated the effect of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC, median 500 IU) and vitamin K (10-20 mg) or either on blood coagulation and clinical findings in 17 patients with major hemorrhagic complication during warfarin treatment. Their international normalized ratio (INR) at admission was median 2.7 (2.0-above 10.0). In 11 patients treated with PCC and vitamin K, INR decreased to median 1.13 (0.91-1.36) 10 min after the administration with elevation of plasma levels of coagulant factors II, VII, IX, X and protein C.INR decreased abruptly after the administration of PCC without vitamin K in two patients but it increased again 12-24 h after, with decrease of coagulant factors levels. In one of them, a hematoma of the brain enlarged with INR re-increase 12-24 h after the administration. In four patients treated with vitamin K alone, INR decreased slowly from 2.69 (1.03-3.35) to 1.28 (1.25-1.44) 12-24 h after the administration in parallel with gradual increase of the coagulant factors.PCC administration with or without vitamin K seems to be more effective in rapidly correcting increased INR levels than vitamin K treatment without PCC. PCC without vitamin K may result in re-increase of INR and clinical deterioration.
The transition from benign adenosis to clear cell carcinoma of the vagina has not been established beyond doubt. The history of a patient regularly followed in a diethystilbestrol (DES) clinic shows initial benign adenosis with normal cytology and subsequent development of abnormal cytology and clear cell adenocarcinoma. The authors suspect transition from benign epithelium to malignancy; however, detailed serial histologic study failed to show clear transition. Frequent and thorough examination of DES patients is needed if malignant change is to be diagnosed early.
