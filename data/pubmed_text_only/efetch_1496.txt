Immature rats are more susceptible to clonic seizures induced by aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) than mature and senile rats. Highest susceptibility to AOAA seizures was observed in 7-14-day-old rat pups. The lowest susceptibility was recorded in 10-20 month-old rats. AOAA seizures in 14-day-old rats were blocked by clonazepam and valproate, but not by phenobarbital, carbamazepine, diphenylhydantoin, trimethadione or ethosuximide. Morphological analysis of brains from 14-day- and 3-month-old rats which experienced AOAA seizures did not reveal epilepsy-related damage. These observations suggest that immature rat brain is highly prone to convulsions induced by AOAA and that such convulsions are difficult to control by available antiepileptic treatment.
To understand the genetic predisposition to selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (IgAD), we performed a genome-wide association study in 430 affected individuals (cases) from Sweden and Iceland and 1,090 ethnically matched controls, and we performed replication studies in two independent European cohorts. In addition to the known association of HLA with IgAD, we identified association with a nonsynonymous variant in IFIH1 (rs1990760G>A, P = 7.3 x 10(-10)) which was previously associated with type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus. Variants in CLEC16A, another known autoimmunity locus, showed suggestive evidence for association (rs6498142C>G, P = 1.8 x 10(-7)), and 29 additional loci were identified with P < 5 x 10(-5). A survey in IgAD of 118 validated non-HLA autoimmunity loci indicated a significant enrichment for association with autoimmunity loci as compared to non-autoimmunity loci (P = 9.0 x 10(-4)) or random SNPs across the genome (P < 0.0001). These findings support the hypothesis that autoimmune mechanisms may contribute to the pathogenesis of IgAD.
Weight gain is a problem commonly encountered with antipsychotic treatment and has become more apparent with increasing use of the newer atypical antipsychotics. The adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin, has been associated with body weight and energy homeostasis, and abnormal regulation of leptin could play a role in weight gain induced by antipsychotics. We investigated whether a leptin gene promoter variant affected weight gain after long-term treatment with clozapine in chronic schizophrenia. Leptin G2548A polymorphism was genotyped in 102 Chinese Han inpatients with chronic schizophrenia treated with clozapine. Weight gains, expressed as change in body mass index (BMI), were monitored after long-term clozapine treatment. We found a significant relationship between the 3 leptin G/A genotypes and mean BMI gain (F(2,99) = 3.35, P = 0.039, r(2) = 0.09). Moreover, genotype had a strong effect on BMI gain in male (P = 0.004, r(2) = 0.16), but not in female patients (P > 0.05). Thus, variation in the leptin gene may be a risk factor for weight gain in male patients with schizophrenia on long-term clozapine treatment.
Vitamin C (VIT C) is an exogenous antioxidant able to alter the brain oxidative stress. Antioxidant properties have been showed in seizures and status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine in adult rats. This present study was aimed at was investigating the VIT C effects on latency to first seizure, in percentage of seizures, mortality rate, as well as hippocampal lipid peroxidation levels and catalase activity after seizures and SE. The VIT C effects were investigated after the pretreatment with dose 250 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before pilocarpine administration (400mg/kg, s.c., pilocarpine group (P400)). The VIT C increase the latency to first seizure and decrease the mortality rate and lipid peroxidation levels. In P400+VIT C and VIT C groups were observed an increase in hippocampal catalase activity. Our results suggests that the vitamin C can exert antioxidant and anticonvulsive effects in adult rats, suggesting that this vitamin can be able by reduction of lipid peroxidation content and increased of catalase enzymatic activity which cerebral compensatory mechanisms in free radical formation during SE.
We examined the effect of a calcium antagonist, manidipine hydrochloride, on cardiac hypertrophy and the expression of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), and extracellular matrix protein genes in rats with isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Rats were continuously infused with saline or isoproterenol (0.5 mg/kg per day) for 7 days using an osmotic minipump. Treatment with manidipine hydrochloride (once a day at 3 mg/kg) began 1 day before minipump implantation and continued until the end of the experiments (each group; n = 6). After treatment, left ventricular weight was measured and mRNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. Isoproterenol increased left ventricular weight (2.40 +/- 0.04 g/kg; p < 0.01) without increasing blood pressure. ANP, collagen type I and type III, and fibronectin mRNAs were increased 1.5-(p < 0.01), 1.9- (p < 0.01), 2.7- (p < 0.01), and 3.2-fold (p < 0.01), respectively, by isoproterenol infusion. However, TGF-beta 1, collagen type IV, and laminin B1 and B2 mRNA levels were unchanged by isoproterenol. Manidipine hydrochloride prevented isoproterenol-induced left ventricular hypertrophy (2.26 +/- 0.02 g/kg; p < 0.01) and expression of mRNA of ANP (0.9-fold of the control value; p < 0.01), collagen types I (1.1-fold; p < 0.01) and type III (1.6-fold; p < 0.01), and fibronectin (1.1-fold; p < 0.01). Thus, manidipine hydrochloride prevented cardiac hypertrophy and changes in the expression of genes for ANP and interstitial components of extracellular matrix induced by isoproterenol.
Cardiac toxicity remains an important side effect of anthracyclines. New drug formulations (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [PL-DOX]) seem to be a successful strategy for reducing it. Changes in cardiac function induced by early chemotherapy, however, are subtle and difficult to quantitate by conventional imaging methods. Doppler myocardial imaging-based velocity, strain, and strain rate measurements have been shown to sensitively quantify abnormalities in cardiac function in other settings.
We evaluated the feasibility and sensitivity of strain rate imaging compared with conventional echocardiography in detecting cardiac effects of PL-DOX therapy in elderly patients with cancer. In a pilot study, we examined 16 elderly women (age 69.8 +/- 3.1 years) with breast cancer receiving 6 cycles of PL-DOX. Conventional and Doppler myocardial imaging echocardiography were obtained at baseline and after 3 and 6 cycles of treatment. Segmental peak systolic longitudinal and radial velocity, strain, and strain rate were measured.
Left ventricular dimensions, ejection fraction, and systolic myocardial velocity did not change throughout the follow-up. In contrast, a significant reduction in longitudinal and radial strain and strain rate was found after 6 cycles (longitudinal strain -18.8% +/- 2.8% vs -22.7% +/- 2.8%, P < .001 vs baseline and P = .001 vs after 3 cycles; radial strain 32.3% +/- 8.1% vs 50.1% +/- 11.6%, P < .001 vs baseline). Changes in radial function appeared earlier and were more pronounced than in longitudinal direction.
In contrast with conventional echocardiography and myocardial velocity measurements, myocardial deformation parameters allowed detecting subtle changes in longitudinal and radial left ventricular function after 6 cycles of PL-DOX. We suggest that Doppler-based myocardial deformation imaging should be used for cardiac function monitoring during chemotherapy.
Cocaine and its major metabolite benzoylecgonine (BZE) were determined in blood samples from people arrested in Sweden for driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) over a 5-year period (2000-2004). Venous blood or urine if available, was subjected to a broad toxicological screening analysis for cannabis, cocaine metabolite, amphetamines, opiates and the major benzodiazepines. Verification and quantitative analysis of cocaine and BZE in blood was done by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at limits of quantitation (LOQ) of 0.02mg/L for both substances. Over the study period 26,567 blood samples were analyzed and cocaine and/or BZE were verified in 795 cases (3%). The motorists using cocaine were predominantly men (>96%) with an average age of 28.3+/-7.1 years (+/-standard deviation, S.D.). The concentration of cocaine was below LOQ in 574 cases although BZE was determined at mean, median and highest concentrations of 0.19mg/L, 0.12mg/L and 1.3mg/L, respectively. In 221 cases, cocaine and BZE were together in the blood samples at mean and (median) concentrations of 0.076mg/L (0.05mg/L) and 0.859mg/L (0.70mg/L), respectively. The concentrations of BZE were always higher than the parent drug; mean BZE/cocaine ratio 14.2 (median 10.9) range 1-55. Cocaine and BZE were the only psychoactive substances reported in N=61 cases at mean (median) and highest concentrations of 0.095 (0.07) and 0.5mg/L for cocaine and 1.01 (0.70) and 3.1mg/L for BZE. Typical signs of drug influence noted by the arresting police officers included bloodshot and glossy eyes, agitation, difficulty in sitting still and incoherent speech.
Astaxanthin (AX) is one of the marine carotenoid pigments, which possess powerful biological antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. The purpose of this study is to investigate possible inhibitory effect of AX against inflammation-related mouse colon carcinogenesis and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in male ICR mice. We conducted two different experiments. In the first experiment, we evaluated the effects of AX at three dose levels, 50, 100 and 200 ppm in diet, on colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS in mice. In the second, the effects of the AX (100 and 200 ppm) in diet on DSS-induced colitis were determined. We found that dietary AX significantly inhibited the occurrence of colonic mucosal ulcers, dysplastic crypts, and colonic adenocarcinoma at week 20. AX-feeding suppressed expression of inflammatory cytokines, including nuclear factor (NF)-κB, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β, inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis in the colonic adenocarcinomas. Feeding with 200 ppm AX, but not 100 ppm, significantly inhibited the development of DSS-induced colitis. AX feeding (200 ppm in diet) also lowered the protein expression of NF-κB, and the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Our results suggest that the dietary AX suppresses the colitis and colitis-related colon carcinogenesis in mice, partly through inhibition of the expression of inflammatory cytokine and proliferation. Our findings suggest that AX is one of the candidates for prevention of colitis and inflammation-associated colon carcinogenesis in humans.
Tumors arising in the lungs are in over 90% bronchogenic carcinomas that have been attributed predominantly to tobacco smoking, asbestos or air pollution but little is known about endogenous factors that could facilitate their development and invasiveness. The lungs originate embryologically from the same endoderm cells which form the epithelia lining the digestive tract, where gastrin is the major proliferative stimulus.
Since lung cancer patients were recruited mostly among smokers, who also have been found to exhibit significantly higher infection rate of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection than non-smokers and, as since the HP-infected subjects show enhanced plasma levels of gastrin, we decided 1) to compare the seroprevalence of HP and the expression of its cytotoxin, CagA, in lung cancer patients with those in the age- and gender-matched controls without cancer: 2) to determine the gene expression for gastrin and its receptors (CCKB-R) in lung cancer, 3) to assess the gastrin levels in plasma bronchial lavage and in tumor tissue and 4) to examine the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 in cancer tissue resection margin and intact bronchial mucosa.
The trial material included 50 patients with lung carcinoma and 100 age- and gender-matched controls. Anti-HP and anti-CagA IgG seroprevalence was estimated by specific antisera using ELISA tests. Gene expression of gastrin, CCKB-R, COX-1 and COX-2 was examined using RT-PCR, while gastrin was measured by specific RIA.
The seroprevalence of HP, especially that expressing CagA, is significantly higher in lung cancers than in healthy controls. Both gastrin and CCKB-R mRNA were detected in the cancer tissue and at the resection margin and similarly COX-2 mRNA was expressed in most cancers and resection margin but not in bronchial mucosa where only COX-1 was found. The lung cancer tissue and resection margin contained many folds larger amounts of immunoreactive gastrin than intact bronchial mucosa.
We report a 23-year-old man presenting with chest pain. He denoted skin eruptions on his hands, lips, mouth, and penis 24 to 36 hours after he had taken flurbiprofen 10 days ago. Detailed examination showed an ulcerated, pitching lesion with a dimension of approximately 2x2 cm on his penis; however, other explained skin lesions were ameliorated. ST elevations were present in the electrocardiogram. Cardiac biomarkers gradually rose. The scintigraphy showed myocardial hypoperfusion in the inferoseptal wall. This phenomenon is a rare case of myocarditis due to hypersensitivity reaction. In the case of nonspecific angina pectoris accompanied by electrocardiogram changes, drug-induced myocarditis must hold a place in differential diagnoses.
Malignant renal hypertension was induced to Wistar rats by means of two methods (Lörincz-Gorácz and Rojo-Ortega-Genest procedures), and hypoxaemia was produced by application of two ligatures to an aortic segment, for two hours. The lesions caused by these experimentally established pathological conditions were analysed by the following criteria, after treatment with a Ca-blocking agent (Nitrendipine, Bayer, Leverkusen): Changes in systematic blood pressure; Histochemical detectability of myocardial and vascular lesions as a consequence of artificially induced hypertension and hypoxaemia; Assessment by means of the tracer technique (Ferrlecit, Nattermann, Cologne) of alterations to vascular permeability in small cardiac vessels of rats treated and not treated with the Ca-blocking agent; Detection of lesions in small vessels of other organs, such as intestine, mesentery, and pancreas, in rats treated and not treated with the Ca-blocking agent. This study has been conducted for the purpose of elucidating vascular lesions resulting from lasting hypertension and short-term hypoxaemia, with particular attention being given to effects of therapeutic intervention on morphological expression of vascular damage. The Ca-blocking agent had a favourable effect on vascular alterations due to long-term and short-term injuries, since the animals treated with Nitrendipine exhibited drop in blood pressure and developed very mild vascular lesions, if any. The cardioprotective action of Nitrendipine was readily obvious under the above experimental conditions.
A case is reported of delirium and seizures due to the abrupt withdrawal from the benzodiazepine alprazolam. Because of their short half-life, agents such as alprazolam may present a greater risk of withdrawal reactions than longer acting agents.
In adult rats, trans-resveratrol attenuates kainic acid (KA)-induced convulsions and the associated hippocampal neurotoxicity. Increased neuronal survival was correlated with reduced lipid peroxidation. Since free radical generation after KA is age dependent and does not correlate with the onset of seizure-induced injury, the present study investigated whether daily trans-resveratrol treatment in development could protect the juvenile hippocampus from seizures and onset of damage at postnatal (P) day 21. Rat pups were treated with daily injections of trans-resveratrol under three dosage regimens (1-15 mg/kg and 20-50mg/kg). Weight, electroencephalography (EEG), histology, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor expression were determined. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was assessed from separate animals. trans-Resveratrol did not interfere with growth or attenuate KA-induced EEG seizures. However, modest protection was afforded in the CA1, the subregion most sensitive to injury at this age. The CA3 and entorhinal amygdala cortex (AMG/EC) were not spared. Changes in NR1 subunit or NR1 C2 splice variant expression were also not prevented. Baseline MDA concentrations of hippocampal subfields were low at P14, P21, and P60 and high in aged adults. Glutamate (100 μM) to stimulate peroxidation products was significant at young ages but was much greater at older ages. After KA, elevated MDA levels were observed at 24h but only in adult preparations. Thus, while antioxidant therapy with trans-resveratrol may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to hinder epileptic activity and neurodegeneration at adult ages, it had only modest effects at young ages when production of free radicals within limbic structures is limited in this experimental model of seizures.
An 11-year-old, 25-kg girl with congenital myelomeningocele was scheduled for posterior spinal fusion because of progressive scoliosis. After induction of general anesthesia and administration of a standard dose of intravenous esmolol hydrochloride, her cardiac rhythm progressed to asystole. Although given ephedrine, epinephrine, and atropine sulfate, the patient's normal heart rhythm could not be restored until calcium chloride was administered. A review of the medical literature indicates that the optimal treatment for acute beta-blocker toxicity is intravenous glucagon. Calcium administration should also be considered. Acute esmolol toxicity may be self-limiting because of its extremely short half-life.
The molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis in mesothelioma involve the loss of negative regulators of cell growth including p16INK4a. Absence of expression of the p16INK4a gene product is exhibited in virtually all mesothelioma tumors and cell lines examined to date. Loss of p16INK4a expression has also been frequently observed in more common neoplasms such as lung cancer as well. In a wide variety of these malignancies, including lung cancer, p16INK4a expression is known to be inactivated by hypermethylation of the first exon. This project (CALGB 159904) intended to test the hypothesis that in mesothelioma loss of p16INK4a via methylation would correlate with response to the cytidine analog and methylation inhibitor dihydro-5-azacytidine (DHAC).
Using tissue samples from CALGB 8833 and 9031, two clinical studies which used DHAC based therapy in mesothelioma, this study tested the hypothesis that tumors possessing methylation of p16INK4a would have a better response and survival following DHAC treatment than their nonmethylated counterparts.
Methylation of p16INK4a was identified in 4 of the 20 specimens. Although there was a trend towards improved survival the result was not statistically significant.
There was no significant correlation between the presence of p16INK4a methylation and response to DHAC therapy or overall survival.
Striatal pathways are important for modulating the threshold for seizures in the rat forebrain. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), an excitatory amino acid derivative and powerful anticonvulsant agent, when injected into the brain, has been shown to protect adult rats against kindling and pilocarpine-induced seizures when injected into the caudate-putamen. The present study examines whether the anticonvulsant action of NMDA in the caudate-putamen varies with age. Bilateral striatal administration of NMDA was effective in suppressing bicuculline-induced seizures in rats older than 23 days of age. The results suggest that striatal pathways involved in the anticonvulsant activity of NMDA in the caudate-putamen are not functionally active in developing rats before the 4th week of life.
To estimate the effect of aluminum on hippocampal intracellular Ca²+ concentration and expression of phospholipase C (PLC) and NMDA receptor α (NMDARα) genes in hippocampus as well as the neural behaviors in weaning rats through subchronic exposure in order to explore the mechanism which aluminum impaired the ability of learning and memory of central nervous system development.
Weaning Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups based on their body weight. Aluminium chloride was administered by water at the doses of 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.6% (m/v) for 90 days. Platform experiment was used to detect the activity of learning and memory. Fura-2/AM calcium ions fluorescence indicator was used to measure Ca²+ concentration in hippocampal neurons. Western blot method was used to detect the expressions of PLC and NMDARα genes.
The incubation of rats in platform experiment [(232.20 ± 57.45), (35.00 ± 9.37), (16.10 ± 5.57) s] shortened while increase of mistake times (1.10 ± 0.74, 2.20 ± 0.92, 3.40 ± 1.51) was significantly associated with the dose of aluminum (P < 0.01). The Ca(2+) concentration decreased significantly in the rats of aluminum exposed groups (P < 0.01). The expression of PLC and NMDARα in aluminum exposed groups (0.30 ± 0.06, 0.18 ± 0.04, 0.16 ± 0.03; 0.38 ± 0.03, 0.32 ± 0.02, 0.25 ± 0.02) decreased significantly compared with that in the control group (0.47 ± 0.07, 0.48 ± 0.04) (P < 0.01) and there was a dose-effect relationship in the NMDARα expression.
Subchronic exposure of aluminium could impair the ability of learning and memory in rats during development, inhibit the expression of NMDARα and PLC and reduce Ca²+ concentration, suggesting that the disorder of Ca²+ signaling system might be one of mechanisms of aluminium damaging the ability of learning and memory.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is commonly used for the treatment of hematological and solid tumors. However, there are serious toxic effects on the cardiovascular system, which limits the application of the drug. Recently, melatonin has been reported to have immunomodulatory effect in addition to lowering cholesterol levels as well as inhibiting malignant tumors. In this study, the effect of melatonin against the toxicity of doxorubicin was investigated in rats. Hemodynamic function, pathological and biochemical changes were determined in different treated hearts. Our findings showed that a significant protection by melatonin (6 mg kg(-1) for 15 days, cumulative dose of 90 mg kg(-1)) against the DOX-induced toxicity was observed. Cardiac function was improved and lipid peroxidation decreased after melatonin treatment. It is concluded that melatonin provides protection against doxorubicin toxicity via an attenuation of lipid peroxidation.
The outcomes of lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B patients treated with long-term adefovir dipivoxil have not been well described. This study aims to characterize the virological and biochemical response and to determine factors that may influence the development of resistance to adefovir.
A retrospective review was conducted on all patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B treated with adefovir for a minimum of 6 months at two tertiary referral centers.
Data on 161 patients were analyzed. Seventy-two percent achieved an initial virological response with eventual normalization of alanine aminotransferase in only 67% of patients. Seventeen patients developed adefovir resistance with cumulative resistance rates of 3.2%, 8.8%, and 18% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Twelve (71%) of these patients had a biochemical breakthrough, with one death from fulminant hepatic failure. The median duration of lamivudine crossover was 1 month in adefovir-resistant patients, compared with 12 months for the remainder of the cohort (P < 0.01). Longer crossover therapy reduced the adefovir resistance rate, but did not eliminate it. No adefovir resistance is reported in those who were continued on long-term combination lamivudine-adefovir without a period of adefovir monotherapy.
Combination lamivudine-adefovir therapy protected against the emergence of adefovir resistance.
Risk for the development of liver disease was estimated in 115 adults with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, most of whom were of PI type (protease inhibitor type) Z. Seventy-one subjects were ascertained through their disease; 44 were ascertained independently of disease. A low concentration of serum prealbumin was sensitive in detecting impaired liver function and may indicate functioning cell mass, a different parameter than is measured by liver enzymes. Liver disease has usually been considered rare in adults with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. However, the risk for the development of liver disease was relatively high for men between 51 and 60 years of age. The risk for women was lower than that for men. Our study indicates that a periodic assessment of liver function may be warranted for patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency who are over 40 years of age.
Minocycline has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the cellular consequences of minocycline treatment on the secondary injury response are poorly understood. We examined the ability of minocycline to reduce oligodendrocyte apoptosis, microglial/macrophage activation, corticospinal tract (CST) dieback, and lesion size and to improve functional outcome after SCI. Adult rats were subjected to a C7-C8 dorsal column transection, and the presence of apoptotic oligodendrocytes was assessed within the ascending sensory tract (AST) and descending CST in segments (3-7 mm) both proximal and distal to the injury site. Surprisingly, the numbers of dying oligodendrocytes in the proximal and distal segments were comparable, suggesting more than the lack of axon-cell body contiguity played a role in their demise. Minocycline or vehicle control was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity 30 min and 8 hr after SCI and thereafter twice daily for 2 d. We report a reduction of apoptotic oligodendrocytes and microglia within both proximal and distal segments of the AST after minocycline treatment, using immunostaining for active caspase-3 and Hoechst 33258 staining in combination with cell-specific markers. Activated microglial/macrophage density was reduced remote to the lesion as well as at the lesion site. Both CST dieback and lesion size were diminished after minocycline treatment. Footprint analysis revealed improved functional outcome after minocycline treatment. Thus, minocycline ameliorates multiple secondary events after SCI, rendering this clinically used drug an attractive candidate for SCI treatment trials.
A total of 248 hypertensive patients 45 years old or older with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was included in this 16-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group dose-response study. Doxazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, produced a significant increase in maximum urinary flow rate (2.3 to 3.6 ml. per second) at doses of 4 mg., 8 mg. and 12 mg., and in average flow rate (8 mg. and 12 mg.) compared with placebo. The increase in maximum flow rate was significant with doxazosin versus placebo within 1 week of initiating double-blind therapy. Doxazosin compared to placebo significantly decreased patient-assessed total, obstructive and irritative BPH symptoms. Blood pressure was significantly lower with all doxazosin doses compared with placebo. Adverse events, primarily mild to moderate in severity, were reported in 48% of patients on doxazosin and 35% on placebo. Our results strongly support the use of doxazosin as a nonoperative therapeutic alternative in the management of uncomplicated BPH. Doxazosin would also be particularly useful in the management of patients who have BPH and hypertension.
A 16-week, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose titration study was done on 100 normotensive patients age 45 years or older to determine the efficacy and safety of doxazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Of the 41 efficacy evaluable patients 88% underwent dose titration to a maximum of 8 mg. doxazosin once daily. Maximum and average urinary flow rates increased significantly above baseline with doxazosin (2.9 ml. per second and 1.4 ml. per second, respectively) compared with placebo (0.7 ml. per second and 0.3 ml. per second, respectively). A significant effect on maximum flow rate was noted as early as week 2 of double-blind treatment at the initial efficacy evaluation. Doxazosin was superior to placebo in patient and investigator assessments of total, obstructive and irritative BPH symptoms. The onset of efficacy for total patient-assessed symptoms was significant for doxazosin compared to placebo 4 weeks after the start of the treatment regimen. Statistically significant decreases in mean blood pressure of 4 to 6 mm. Hg were noted with doxazosin compared with placebo. Adverse events, primarily mild to moderate in severity, were reported in 44% of patients given doxazosin and 30% of those given placebo. Our results strongly demonstrate that doxazosin is significantly superior to placebo in the treatment of BPH in normotensive patients, with the patient experiencing significant relief early after initiation of therapy.
Sirolimus (SRL) is a potent immunosuppressive drug used to prevent acute allograft rejection after renal transplantation. Nevertheless, the occurrence of proteinuria has recently been recognized among patients on SRL-based therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. (T II) on proteinuria associated with SRL in renal transplant recipients. According to accepting T II, 36 recipients were divided into 2 groups: T II group (n = 21) and valsartan group (n = 15). The T II group was administered 1 mg/kg/d, and the valsartan group, 80 mg twice per day for 12 months. Efficiency was then evaluated. Complete remission: proteinuria decreased by >50%; partial remission: proteinuria decreased by 20% to 50%; ineffective: proteinuria decreased by <20%. Upon 12-month follow-up, the total effective rates in the T II group and the valsartan group were 95.2% and 86.7% (P < .05), respectively. Twenty of 21 patients with proteinuria in the T II group were negative at 3-month follow-up with disappearance of edema. There were some adverse events that had greater incidence rates in the valsartan group compared with the T II group, such as hyperkalemia (26.7% vs 4.8%). We concluded that the application of T II markedly reduced proteinuria associated with SRL in renal transplant patients.
We previously showed that systemic administration of the atypical neuroleptic clozapine in the rat altered a number of urodynamic variables and inhibited the external urethral sphincter. Since clozapine acts at several receptor types both at the periphery and the central nervous system, the site of action remained uncertain. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of central administration of clozapine on the bladder and the external urethral sphincter during cystometry and to examine differences in spinal versus supraspinal administration. We extended our observations by delivering clozapine centrally in anesthetized rats instrumented with either an intrathecal (L6-S1 spinal segment) or an intracerebroventricular (lateral ventricle) catheter.
Clozapine decreased micturition volume and increased residual volume possibly by acting at a supraspinal site. Expulsion time and amplitude of the high frequency oscillations were reduced by clozapine possibly by acting at a spinal site. Bladder capacity was increased after central clozapine but probably due to a peripheral effect. Clozapine acting at spinal and supraspinal sites increased pressure threshold. Contraction time and peak pressure were not affected by clozapine. The EMG from the external urethral sphincter was also reduced following clozapine centrally and suggests a spinal and a supraspinal site of action.
The results from the present study suggest that spinal and supraspinal central sites mediate clozapine's action in inhibiting expulsion parameters and the external urethral sphincter of the rat. Therefore, the reduction in the voiding efficiency observed after clozapine appears to be mediated by spinal and supraspinal sites.
(Diphenylphosphinodithioato) diphenylantimony (III), Ph2SbS2PPh2 (1) and (diisopropylphosphorodithioato) diphenylantimony(III), Ph2SbS2P(OPri)2 (2) were tested in vivo in male AKR mice and in vitro against Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Both compounds exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory effects on in vivo tumor growth and on in vitro cell proliferation, cell viability, respiration and protein synthesis. The activities of some enzymes involved in energetic metabolism (Ca-ATPase, LDH, G6Pase) were exacerbated in vitro. The inhibitory effects could be related to the imbalance between ATP-producing and ATP-consuming processes in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and also to their cell-cycle specificities.
