Sotalol is a unique beta-blocker that lengthens cardiac repolarization and effective refractory period (ERP). Its efficacy after intravenous (1.5 mg/kg) and oral (160 to 480 mg bid) administration was therefore evaluated in 37 patients with refractory recurrent ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF). Thirty-five patients, 33 with inducible VT/VF, underwent electrophysiologic testing. Intravenous sotalol lengthened the ERP in the atrium (+24.6%, p less than .01), atrioventricular node (+24.9%, p less than .01), and ventricle (+14.9%, p less than .01). It also significantly lengthened sinus node recovery time, corrected QT interval (QTc), and the AH interval, but not the HV interval. Sotalol prevented reinduction of VT/VF in 15 patients (45.5%). Twenty-five of the 33 patients (15 with positive results of electrophysiologic tests; 10 with negative results) were given oral sotalol. The drug was ineffective in seven (26.9%) and aggravated arrhythmia in one (3.8%). In four patients sotalol was withdrawn because of side effects; arrhythmias recurred late in two (7.7%). Eleven patients (42.3%) have continued on oral sotalol over a mean follow-up period of 9.2 +/- 8.6 months. Sotalol reduced (n = 21) total premature ventricular complex (PVC) count on the Holter electrocardiogram by 73% (p less than .01), paired PVCs by 89% (p less than .01), and beats of ventricular tachycardia by 95% (p less than .01). In 52% (n = 11), total reduction in PVCs was at least 85%, and incidence of paired and tachycardiac beats was reduced at least 90% (group A). In the remainder (n = 10), PVC suppression was not significant (group B). Group A included nine patients with nonreinducible VT/VF and two in whom it was reinducible; in group B, eight of 10 patients had reinducible VT/VF. The difference between the two groups (Fisher exact test) was significant (p less than .01). The prevention of reinduction of VT/VF by intravenous sotalol and suppression of spontaneously occurring arrhythmias by the oral drug were both predictive of long-term drug efficacy. Sotalol is a significant advance in the short- and long-term management of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
A case of angina pectoris worsened by prazosin is presented. Since a hypertensive population includes many patients with known or occult coronary artery disease, physicians should use prazosin cautiously in this subgroup, particularly when beta-adrenergic antagonists cannot be used concurrently.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) malfunction, leading to ER stress, can be a consequence of genome instability and hypoxic tissue environments. Cancer cells survive by acquiring or enhancing survival mechanisms to counter the effects of ER stress and these homeostatic responses may be new therapeutic targets. Understanding the links between ER stress and apoptosis may be approached using drugs specifically to target ER stress responses in cancer cells. The retinoid analogue fenretinide [N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide] is a new cancer preventive and chemotherapeutic drug, that induces apoptosis of some cancer cell types via oxidative stress, accompanied by induction of an ER stress-related transcription factor, GADD153. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that fenretinide induces ER stress in neuroectodermal tumour cells, and to elucidate the role of ER stress responses in fenretinide-induced apoptosis. The ER stress genes ERdj5, ERp57, GRP78, calreticulin and calnexin were induced in neuroectodermal tumour cells by fenretinide. In contrast to the apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic drugs vincristine and temozolomide, fenretinide induced the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, expression of ATF4 and splicing of XBP-1 mRNA, events that define ER stress. In these respects, fenretinide displayed properties similar to the ER stress inducer thapsigargin. ER stress responses were inhibited by antioxidant treatment. Knockdown of ERp57 or ERdj5 by RNA interference in these cells increased the apoptotic response to fenretinide. These data suggest that downregulating homeostatic ER stress responses may enhance apoptosis induced by oxidative stress-inducing drugs acting through the ER stress pathway. Therefore, ER-resident proteins such as ERdj5 and ERp57 may represent novel chemotherapeutic targets.
A study was conducted to determine the effects of an oral contraceptive containing 250 mcg of d-norgestrel with 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol on lactation and other functions. 134 healthy women of childbearing age who were breast feeding their young completed more than 3 cycles each, for a total of 1377 cycles for the study. The reported side effects were 1) 12 instances of disturbances in menstruation, 2) 4 instances of abdominal distress, 3) 55 instances of weight change, 4) 11 cases of headache and giddiness, and 5) some dermatitis, pruritus, and breathlessness, none of which was severe enough to warrant discontinuance of therapy. A random sample of 21 women was taken to determine the effect on lactation. 18 of the 21 reported no change in milk production and continued to lactate until the end of the treatment period. Lactation decreased in the other 3 women. Further intensive studies are required before any definitive conclusion can be reached on the effect of this combination on the quality of the breast milk and duration of lactation.
Effects of the blockade of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), type 1 angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or a combination of both, were evaluated in Adriamycin (ADR)-induced glomerulopathy.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-250 g) were induced of glomerulopathy by treatment with ADR (2 mg/kg, i.v.). Six weeks later, they were treated with cilazapril (1 mg/kg/day) and/or losartan (10 mg/kg/day) for an additional 6 weeks.
The urinary excretion of protein progressively increased following the treatment with ADR, which was prevented by ACEi, ARB, and a combination of both. Similarly, the glomerulopathy assessed by glomerulosclerosis index was also ameliorated by ACEi or ARB. However, combined therapy of both ACEi and ARB was without an additional effect (Control 1.4 +/- 0.4%, ADR 10.7 +/- 2.7%**, ACEi 0.8 +/- 0.4%, ARB 2.6 +/- 1.0%, ACEi+ARB 1.7 +/- 1.5%, ** p < 0.01 vs. Control). The expression of transforming growth factor-beta(1) was increased following the treatment with ADR (1.4 +/- 0.07-fold, p < 0.05 vs. Control), however, the degree of which was similarly blunted by either ACEi, ARB, or the combination of both. The expression of type 1 angiotensin II receptor mRNA increased following the treatment with ADR, the degree of which was further upregulated by ACEi and decreased by ARB to the control level (ADR 1.3 +/- 0.06-fold*, ACEi 1.8 +/- 0.05-fold***, ARB 1.0 +/- 0.04-fold, * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001 vs. Control). The combined therapy of ACEi and ARB still showed an upregulation of type 1 angiotensin II receptor mRNA, however, of which degree was mitigated compared with that induced by ACEi alone (ACEi+ARB 1.5 +/- 0.04-fold, ** p < 0.01 vs. Control). On the contrary, the expression of type 2 angiotensin II receptor mRNA was downregulated following the treatment with ADR, which was similarly restored to the control level by ACEi, ARB, and a combination of both (ADR 0.5 +/- 0.08-fold**, ACEi 1.0 +/- 0.06-fold, ARB 1.0 +/- 0.05-fold, ACEi+ARB 1.0 +/- 0.05-fold, ** p < 0.01 vs. Control).
It is suggested that combined therapy of ACEi and ARB with relatively high or maximal doses of each drug has no additive or synergistic benefits on the progression of ADR-induced glomerulopathy. Effects of RAS blockade may in part be related to differential regulation of type 1 and type 2 angiotensin II receptors.
Activation of the superior colliculus has been shown to reproduce the antiepileptic effect of the inhibition of the substantia nigra reticulata. A circuit involving neurons of the caudal deep layers of the superior colliculus has been suggested to control brain stem convulsive seizures. The present study was designed to examine whether a similar circuit is also involved in the control of absence seizures. For this, activation of either the rostral or caudal parts of the deep and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus was applied in a genetic model of absence seizures in the rat (GAERS). Single-shock (5 s) electrical stimulation of the rostral and caudal superior colliculus interrupted ongoing spike-and-wave discharges at an intensity (antiepileptic threshold) significantly lower than the intensity inducing behavioral effects. At this intensity, no interruption of licking behavior was observed in water-deprived rats. Repeated stimulations (5 s on/5 s off) at the antiepileptic threshold reduced absence seizures only during the first 10 min. Bilateral microinjection of a GABA antagonist (picrotoxin, 33 pmol/side) significantly suppressed spike-and-wave discharges when applied in the caudal aspect of the superior colliculus. This antiepileptic effect appears dissociated from an anxiogenic effect, as tested in an elevated plus maze test. Finally, bilateral injection of picrotoxin (33 pmol/side) appeared more effective in the superficial and intermediate layers of the caudal superior colliculus, whereas such injections had only weak effects on absence seizures when applied in the deep layers. These results suggest that a specific population of neurons located in the intermediate and superficial layers of the caudal superior colliculus is involved in the inhibitory control of absence seizures. It may constitute an important relay for the control of absence seizures by the basal ganglia via the substantia nigra reticulata.
The aim of the current study was to assess the viability of the interdigital web pinch model as a test for analgesic activity in volunteer-based early phase drug development.
Pain thresholds and sensitization to a series of four sessions of interdigital web pinching (12 Newtons force) were measured in 26 male volunteers before and 1 and 3 h after oral dosing with ibuprofen (800 mg) or placebo to ibuprofen. Within each time point, the pain thresholds were measured by calculating the average visual analogue scores (VAS) for the first session of pinching (VAS-1). Sensitization to pinching was assessed by calculating the average changes in these scores for the three subsequent sessions of pinching (VAS-2). Moreover, the difference between the VAS score after the first session of pinching and that obtained at the end of the fourth session of pinching was calculated as a secondary endpoint (VAS-3).
Treatment with ibuprofen had no significant effect on VAS-1 at either 1 or 3 h after dosing. However, the mean values of VAS-2 and VAS-3, were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) following treatment with ibuprofen.
This model has been able to detect an antinociceptive effect with ibuprofen. However, large numbers of subjects were required in order to demonstrate this effect and this feature would restrict the model's utility in early phase clinical trials where small numbers of subjects are normally employed.
The American Thoracic Society recommends that specific individuals who are classified as tuberculosis infected receive a year-long course of INH chemoprophylaxis. They further recommend that patients receiving medication be evaluated on a monthly basis to assess the individual for side effects related to the medication. The most prevalent side effects are hypersensitivity, GI distress, hepatitis and neurotoxicity. Subjective data relating to these side effects need to be elicited at every visit and a pertinent physical examination done. Careful monthly monitoring is required to evaluate the patient for the most prevalent and significant side effects of the medication. Nurses must be aware of the significance of this preventive measure, the adverse reactions which may occur with the drug therapy and the health teaching which contributes to patient compliance.
It is difficult to attribute the diagnosis of adverse drug reaction to a condition which is also a common symptom. The decision might be arduous in the case of headache, because this disorder is very frequent in the general population. The drugs that more frequently induce headache belong to a variety of therapeutic classes with different mechanisms of action and different toxicity. In the majority of cases the headache has not a typical feature, it is dose-dependent, and is associated to other symptoms of neurotoxicity. Some drugs cause, instead, a specific headache: this is the case of NO donors, which are also used in experimental studies in order to induce headache. This review describes the classes of drugs which induce headache, analyzes the frequency of headache induction among the drugs of the same class, and discusses the possible mechanisms underlying headache induction. It is to be hoped that a better awareness of this issue would help the physician to consider it in the differential diagnosis of a recent-onset or changed headache and to avoid prescription of drugs known to cause headache to patients already suffering from this disorder.
Symptomatic sinus node abnormalities occurred in a woman receiving lithium carbonate. Stimulation studies of the heart revealed that only the sinus node was affected. The abnormalities disappeared completely following cessation of lithium therapy.
To examine the hypothesis that increases in depression after initiation of treatment with interferon beta-1a for multiple sclerosis can be explained as representing a return to pretreatment levels of depression.
Level of depression in patients with multiple sclerosis was assessed at 3 time points: 2 weeks before initiation of interferon beta-la treatment, at initiation of treatment, and at 2-month follow-up.
A health maintenance organization.
Fifty-six patients with confirmed relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.
The depression-dejection scale of the Profile of Mood States.
Patients who scored high on the depression measure 2 weeks before the initiation of interferon beta-1a treatment showed significant reduction in depression at the initiation of treatment. However, depression returned nearly to initial levels within 2 months.
These findings suggest that increases in depression after initiation of interferon beta-1a treatment are related to level of depression 2 weeks before initiation of treatment. Physicians should assess history of depression for all patients in whom interferon beta-1a treatment is initiated. Patients with a recent history of depression are at risk for increased depression within 2 months after starting interferon beta-1a treatment, even though they may not be depressed at the time of treatment initiation.
To investigate the roles imposed on astrocytes for glutamate metabolism, a specific inhibitor of glutamine synthetase (GS), methionine sulfoximine (MSO), was repeatedly administered to rats and histopathological changes were correlated with glycogen accumulation and the immunocytochemistry of GS and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Prolonged MSO-loading (every 12 h up to three times, 100-150 mg/kg body weight) brought about the appearance of astrocytes with swollen, watery nuclei reminiscent of Alzheimer II glia chiefly in the neocortex, hippocampus and lateral thalamus after 24 h. Concomitantly, profound accumulation of glycogen ensued in the superficial three layers of the neocortex, hippocampus and pyriform cortex. GS immunoreactivity appeared enhanced in the cortex, hippocampus and lateral thalamus with parallel increase in GFAP immunoreactivity after prolonged treatment. Oligodendrocytes in the diencephalon and brain stem also normally contained GS immunoreactivity. Some animals developed necrotic lesions in the dorsolateral neocortex. The area of glycogen accumulation coincided with the known distribution of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors and, thus, GS may play important roles in NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate metabolism. The Alzheimer II type changes, however, did not correlate with NMDA-receptor distribution. These results indicate certain regionalizations in the roles of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in glutamate and ammonia metabolisms.
We compare the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) with mitomycin C on recurrence of stages Ta and T1 bladder carcinoma.
Combined published and unpublished data from comparative studies on BCG versus mitomycin C for superficial bladder carcinoma considering possible confounding factors were analyzed. Odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI were used as primary effect size estimate. Toxicity data were evaluated descriptively.
In 11 eligible clinical trials 1,421 patients were treated with BCG and 1,328 were treated with mitomycin C. Within the overall median followup time of 26 months 38.6% of the patients in the BCG group and 46.4% of those in the mitomycin C group had tumor recurrence. In 7 of 11 studies BCG was significantly superior to mitomycin C, in 3 studies no significant difference was found, while in 1 study mitomycin C was significantly superior to BCG. An overall statistically significant superiority of BCG versus mitomycin C efficacy in reducing tumor recurrence was detected (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.84, p = 0.005). In the subgroup treated with BCG maintenance all 6 individual studies showed a significant superiority of BCG over mitomycin C (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.53, p <0.001). In 4 of the 5 studies with reported data on toxicity BCG associated cystitis was significantly more frequent than in the mitomycin C group (53.8% versus 39.2%). The combined cystitis OR was 1.81 (95% CI 1.48 to 2.23, p <0.001). The OR for cystitis in the BCG maintenance group did not significantly differ from that in the nonmaintenance therapy group.
The results suggest superiority of BCG over mitomycin C for prevention of tumor recurrences in the combined data and particularly in the BCG maintenance treatment subgroup, irrespective of the actual (intermediate or high) tumor risk status. The toxicity with BCG is higher but does not differ between BCG maintenance and nonmaintenance groups.
Sodium valproate was administered to 38 patients, admitted to our unit in the last 18 months, and chosen because they had: (1) poor control of their seizures; (2) therapeutic concentrations in their plasma of at least two major antiepileptic drugs. In 8 of them, a therapeutic dosage of VPA caused modifications of the state of consciousness ranging from coma to drowsiness and stupor. These patients also showed gastrointestinal disturbances, asterixis, ataxia, tremor and a worsening of EEG abnormalities. The side effects of the drug were constantly associated with increased concentration of blood ammonia. Better penetration of ammonia into the CNS of patients undergoing frequent seizures and possibly having imperfectly functioning biological barriers, could explain our observations. In view of the unusually high percentage of patients suffering from serious VPA side effects, it is probably advisable to carefully monitor ammonemia in the first few days of VPA therapy in every patient treated with multiple anticonvulsants.
A man with typical symptoms of lithium intoxication had, in addition, severe and persistent oculogyric crises, which cleared completely during recovery. Previous reports have demonstrated that lithium may impair basal ganglia activity, but this is the first reported case of oculogyric crises induced by lithium carbonate intoxication.
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) exists in the brain and it may be involved in pathogenesis of neurological and psychiatric disorders including seizures. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the effects of some angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi; captopril, enalapril, fosinopril and zofenopril), commonly used as antihypertensive agents, in the DBA/2 mice animal model of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Furthermore, the co-administration of these compounds with some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; carbamazepine, diazepam, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate and valproate) was studied in order to identify possible positive interactions in the same model. All ACEi were able to decrease the severity of audiogenic seizures with the exception of enalapril up to the dose of 100mg/kg, the rank order of activity was as follows: fosinopril>zofenopril>captopril. The co-administration of ineffective doses of all ACE inhibitors with AEDs, generally increased the potency of the latter. Fosinopril was the most active in potentiating the activity of AEDs and the combination of ACEi with lamotrigine and valproate was the most favorable, whereas, the co-administrations with diazepam and phenobarbital seemed to be neutral. The increase in potency was generally associated with an enhancement of motor impairment, however, the therapeutic index of combined treatment of AEDs with ACEi was predominantly more favorable than control. ACEi administration did not influence plasma and brain concentrations of the AEDs studied excluding pharmacokinetic interactions and concluding that it is of pharmacodynamic nature. In conclusion, fosinopril, zofenopril, enalapril and captopril showed an additive anticonvulsant effect when co-administered with some AEDs, most notably carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate and valproate, implicating a possible therapeutic relevance of such drug combinations.
The frequently used chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is known to cause angina pectoris and arrhythmias; myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death could occur. Potential reasons for these phenomena range from toxic/metabolic disturbances to coronary artery spasms. This report shows angiographically proven spasmophilia of the coronary arteries and contributes to the understanding of angina pectoris occurring during treatment with 5-FU. Thus, verapamil type calcium antagonists as well as nitrates should be administered primarily in patients with coronary artery disease and in all patients who had been symptomatic during 5-FU administration in order to prevent further episodes.
To compare the side effect profiles of regimens of oral and vaginal administration of misoprostol after a single oral dose of 200 mg of mifepristone and to investigate patients' perceptions of medical abortion.
Double-blind, randomised controlled trial.
Fifteen gynaecological clinics in 11 countries.
A total of 2219 healthy pregnant women requesting medical abortion with < or =63 days of amenorrhoea. Two thousand women were asked about their perceptions of the method.
Mifepristone 200 mg orally on day one, followed by 0.8 mg misoprostol either orally or vaginally on day three. The oral group (O/O group) and one of the vaginal groups (V/O group) continued with 0.4 mg of oral misoprostol, and the vaginal-only group (V-only group) with oral placebo, twice daily for seven days. Side effects were recorded daily by women and reported at each visit. After misoprostol administration at the clinic, side effects were recorded at 1-hour interval up to 3 hours. Patients' perceptions were asked at the second follow up visit, six weeks after treatment.
The outcome measures were the following: pregnancy-related symptoms (nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, fatigue, dizziness, headache), drug-related side effects (diarrhoea, fever, rash and blood pressure change), side effects related to the abortion process (lower abdominal pain) and women's perceptions of the method.
The pregnancy-related symptoms decreased in all groups after misoprostol, and breast tenderness decreased already after mifepristone. Oral administration of misoprostol was associated with a higher frequency of nausea and vomiting than vaginal administration at 1 hour after administration. With oral misoprostol, diarrhoea was more frequent at 1, 2 and at 3 hours after administration than with vaginal administration. Misoprostol induced fever during at least 3 hours after administration in up to 6% of the women, this peak being slightly higher and taking place later with the vaginal route. Lower abdominal pain peaked at 1 and 2 hours after oral misoprostol, while it did so at 2 and 3 hours after vaginal misoprostol. In the two groups that continued misoprostol, 27% of women had diarrhoea between the misoprostol visit and the two-week follow up visit, compared with 9% in the placebo group. Among the women studied, 84% would choose medical abortion again, 9% would choose surgical abortion and 7% did not know. Twenty-three percent of the women would choose to have a possible future abortion at home, 70% at a health facility and 7% did not know.
The pregnancy-related symptoms decrease significantly with time during medical abortion. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were more frequent after oral administration of misoprostol. Pain related to the abortion process occurs earlier after oral misoprostol. Should a need arise, a majority of women would choose medical abortion again and would prefer to have it at a health facility rather than at home.
A previous study aimed at revealing the prevalence and determinants of lithium induced polyuria suggested an increased risk of polyuria (urine volume > or =3 L/24 h) in those using serotonergic antidepressants next to lithium.
The objective of our study was to re-evaluate this secondary finding in another study population.
We performed a multicenter medical chart review study in patients using lithium in whom a 24-hour urine volume had been determined.
We included 116 patients, twelve (26%)of the 46 patients with polyuria used serotonergic antidepressants compared to ten (14%) of the 70 patients without polyuria. We found an increased risk of polyuria in lithium users concurrently using serotonergic antidepressants (oddsratio 2.86; 95% confidence interval 1.00-8.21), adjusted for age, gender, use of antiepileptics and thyreomimetics.
Our results confirm the previous secondary finding of an increased risk of polyuria in patients using serotonergic antidepressants next to lithium. Physicians should take this into account when evaluating polyuria in patients using lithium and when choosing an antidepressant in patients using lithium.
To investigate the location alteration of Smad2 and Smad4 mRNAs in the liver during and after fibrogenesis in rats.
Eighty male Wistar rats weighing approximately 200 g each were used. The rat models of experimental hepatic fibrosis were established by injection with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), normal rats and rats were injected with olive oil and served as control groups. In situ hybridization(ISH) was used to detect the Smad2 and Smad4 mRNA in liver.
In situ hybridization showed Smad2 and Smad4 mRNA expressions in the cytoplasm of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), fibroblasts and myofibroblasts around the central vein and hepatic sinus during and after fibrogenesis. Expression of Smad2, 4 mRNA was higher than that in normal and control rats.
In the process of and after hepatic fibrosis formation, HSC, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are the major cells that express Smad2 and Smad4. The more serious the hepatic fibrosis is in the injured liver, the higher the level of Smad2 and Smad4 gene expression is during and after fibrogenesis respectively.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR/Fxr) is a bile acid-regulated nuclear receptor that promotes hepatic bile acid metabolism, detoxification, and liver regeneration. However, the adaptive pathways under conditions of bile acid stress are not fully elucidated. We found that wild-type but not Fxr knockout mice on diets enriched with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) increase their liver/body weight ratios by 50% due to hepatocellular hypertrophy. Microarray analysis identified Hex (Hematopoietically expressed homeobox), a central transcription factor in vertebrate embryogenesis and liver development, as a novel CDCA- and Fxr-regulated gene. HEX/Hex was also regulated by FXR/Fxr and CDCA in primary mouse hepatocytes and human HepG2 cells. Comparative genomic analysis identified a conserved inverted repeat-1-like DNA sequence within a 300 base pair enhancer element of intron-1 in the human and mouse HEX/Hex gene. A combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation, electromobility shift assay, and transcriptional reporter assays demonstrated that FXR/Fxr binds to this element and mediates HEX/Hex transcriptional activation.
HEX/Hex is a novel bile acid-induced FXR/Fxr target gene during adaptation of hepatocytes to chronic bile acid exposure.
Anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug development has been challenged by a lack of experience with inhibitors inclusive of in vitro, animal model, and clinical study. This manuscript outlines activity and correlation across such a spectrum of models and into clinical trials with a novel selective nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) polymerase inhibitor, HCV796. Enzyme assays yielded median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 0.01 to 0.14 microM for genotype 1, with half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)s) of 5 nM and 9 nM against genotype 1a and 1b replicons. In the chimeric mouse model, a 2.02 +/- 0.55 log reduction in HCV titer was seen with monotherapy, whereas a suboptimal dose of 30 mg/kg three times per day in combination with interferon demonstrated a 2.44 log reduction (P = 0.001 versus interferon alone) Clinical outcomes in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin have revealed additive efficacy in treatment naïve patients. Abnormal liver function test results were observed in 8% of HCV-796 patients treated for over 8 weeks, resulting in suspension of further trial activity.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor HCV796 demonstrated potent anti-HCV activity consistently through enzyme inhibition assays, subgenomic replicon, and chimeric mouse studies. Strong correlations of outcomes in the mouse model were seen with subsequent clinical trials, including a plateau in dose-related antiviral activity and additive impact from combination therapy with interferon. These outcomes demonstrate the utility of the range of in vitro and in vivo models now available for anti-HCV drug development and support the potential utility of polymerase inhibitors in future combination therapies for HCV treatment.
The authors performed a bioassay of midazolam maleate, an investigational, water-soluble benzodiazepine; to determine the duration of sleep after a single intravenous dose. Sodium thiopental was the standard against which the midazolam maleate was assayed. Prior to operation 60 surgical patients were randomly given one of five doses of drugs, either thiopental, 180 or 270 mg, or midazolam maleate, 6.6, 10, or 15 mg. The designated drug was infused intravenously over 20 sec in a double-blind fashion. Sleep was defined as commencing when the patients stopped counting, and ending when they could respond appropriately to verbal commands. Midazolam maleate, 10 mg (9--12 mg represents 95 per cent confidence limits), was found to be equivalent to thiopental, 200 mg, in the duration of sleep induced. Apnea following the infusion was less frequent and of shorter duration after midazolam maleate than after thiopental. It is concluded that midazolam maleate is a satisfactory agent for the induction of anesthesia, and that it is about 20 times as potent as thiopental.
1. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist carvedilol reverses cardiac dysfunction in the failing heart. A recent study showed that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists indirectly normalize Ca(2+)-regulatory proteins. The relationship between these two phenomena and the suitable dosage of carvedilol remains unclear. 2. We investigated the change in left ventricular (LV) remodelling and function in a rat model of heart failure due to myocardial infarction (MI) with or without carvedilol (30 or 2 mg/kg per day) treatment for 6 weeks. The expression of mRNA and proteins of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and phospholamban (PLB) in cardiomyocytes was also measured. 3. There was significant LV remodelling and cardiac contractile dysfunction in MI rats. The expression of SERCA mRNA and protein were downregulated (P < 0.01), but the expression of PLB mRNA and protein were upregulated (P < 0.01) in MI rats compared with sham-operated rats. After treatment with carvedilol, LV remodelling and cardiac contractile dysfunction were clearly improved. Low-dose carvedilol was better at improving some parameters of LV remodelling and function than the high dose. Carvedilol partially restored the low expression of SERCA (P < 0.05), but had no effect on PLB expression (P > 0.05). Moreover, low-dose carvedilol induced a more significant improvement in SERCA expression than did the high dose (P < 0.05). 4. The results of the present study suggest that carvedilol is effective in improving LV remodelling and cardiac contractile dysfunction after MI. This may be related to the normalization of SERCA expression.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a well-known complication of heparin administration but usually resolves upon discontinuation without sequelae. However, a small proportion of HIT patients develop thrombosis associated with HIT, designated as HITT, which is often life-threatening and may lead to gangrene and amputations. Existing laboratory methods of confirming HIT/HITT do not distinguish between HIT and HITT. We report a flow cytometric assay of platelet activation marker CD62P to distinguish the effects of addition of HIT vs. HITT plasma to normal blood. Briefly, normal whole blood was incubated with platelet-poor plasma from 12 patients with HITT, 30 with HIT, and 65 controls, in presence and absence of heparin, and expression of CD62P was assayed by flow cytometry. When the ratios of fluorescent intensity of CD62P with heparin divided by that without heparin were compared, HITT plasma induced significantly higher ratios than HIT plasma (HITT ratios approximately 2.5 vs. HIT ratios approximately 1.2; p <0.001). Eleven of 12 HITT patients were positive by this test but only 5 of 30 HIT patients were positive (p <0.0005). In a case of HIT with silent thrombosis, this assay gave a positive results prior to clinically evident thrombosis. In conclusion, this method distinguishes HITT from HIT and may be clinically useful in the detection of HITT, allowing early intervention for preventing catastrophic thrombosis.
To characterize the ocular changes associated with peginterferon alpha 2b (peg-IFN alpha-2b) and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection in HIV co-infected individuals.
A prospective, open-label trial treating HIV/hepatitis C (HCV) co-infected individuals with peg-IFN alpha-2b and ribavirin at the Warren Grant Magnusson Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. Twenty-three patients with a high mean CD4+ T-cell count were treated with peg-IFN alpha-2b and ribavirin and followed for 40 to 88 weeks. Ophthalmologic evaluations including visual acuity, visual field testing, color vision examination and indirect ophthalmoscopy were performed at baseline and every 3 months.
Eight of the 23 patients (35%) developed ophthalmologic pathology, including cotton wool spots, cataracts, and two patients developed decreased color vision. These two patients regained their color vision, one after cessation of anti-HCV therapy.
Although retinal pathologies have been reported in patients treated with interferon-alpha, they have not been reported during peg-IFN alpha-2b therapy nor in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The incidence of serious ocular pathology associated with anti-HCV therapy may be very high and is probably associated with peg-IFN alpha-2b. Increased monitoring of patients treated with peg-IFN alpha-2b for retinal and visual changes is warranted.
Daikenchuto (TU-100), a traditional Japanese medicine, has been reported to up-regulate the adrenomedullin (ADM)/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) system, which is involved in intestinal vasodilatation. The microvascular dysfunction of the intestine in Crohn's disease (CD), due to down-regulation of the ADM/CGRP system, is etiologically related to the recurrence of CD. Therefore, we investigated the vasodilatory effect of TU-100 in a CD rat model.
Colitis was induced by the rectal instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) in rats. Laser Doppler blood flowmetry was used to measure colonic blood flow. ADM, CGRP, and their receptors in the ischemic colon were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme immunoassays. Additionally, we determined whether the intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 released ADM in response to TU-100.
TU-100 increased blood flow in ischemic segments of the colon but not in hyperemic segments. Pretreatment with an antibody to ADM abolished the vasodilatory effect of TU-100. CGRP levels and βCGRP mRNA expression were decreased in the ischemic colon, while protein and mRNA levels of ADM were unchanged. Hydroxy α-sanshool, the main constituent of TU-100, was the most active component in improving blood flow. Additionally, both TU-100 and hydroxy α-sanshool enhanced the release of ADM from IEC-6 cells.
In the ischemic colon, endogenous βCGRP, but not ADM, was decreased. Thus, it was concluded that TU-100 ameliorated microvascular dysfunction by the up-regulation of endogenous ADM in the CD rat model. TU-100 may be a possible therapeutic agent for gastrointestinal ischemia-related diseases including CD.
Sirolimus (SRL) is a recently available immunosuppressive agent. SRL, is a macrolide isolated from Streptomyces hydroscopicus that, in complex with its cellular receptor, FK binding protein, potently inhibits downstream signaling by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). It has been shown to reduce the incidence of acute rejection episode after renal transplantation. SRL by itself does not seem to cause significant nephrotoxicity in most animals and human studies in normal conditions. However, when combined with calcineurin inhibitors, serum creatinine levels often increase. The mechanisms for the synergism of this side-effect are still discussed. Furthermore, recent clinical data have shown that the administration of SRL immediately after renal transplant delay the recovery from delayed graft function. This effect may be secondary to the inhibition of the proliferation of the renal tubular cells which is a normal process for tubular repair. Some experimental data have confirmed this hypothesis. Finally, in the long-term, SRL use has been associated with a significant increase of proteinuria which may in the long-term increase the risk of graft loss of cardio-vascular morbio-mortality. For all these reasons, SRL nephrotoxicty has become an important issue after renal transplantation. The review will discuss the clinical and the experimental data regarding this complication, which has been underestimated.
