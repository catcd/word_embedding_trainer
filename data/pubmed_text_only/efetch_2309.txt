A 59-year-old man developed red, swollen and warm feet accompanied by intermittent burning pain during treatment for cardiac failure and arrhythmias with several drugs including verapamil. The condition gradually worsened until there was persistent disabling burning pain and severe erythema and swelling of the feet. Aspirin and other analgesics were ineffective in relieving the discomfort. Histopathology of punch biopsies showed a mild perivascular mononuclear infiltrate and moderate perivascular oedema. Within 2 weeks of stopping verapamil the burning pain, erythema, and swelling of the feet had resolved. The clinical features and subsequent course are consistent with a diagnosis of erythermalgia secondary to verapamil.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), are ubiquitous environmental pollutants found in tobacco smoke, air pollution, and grilled foods. Reactive metabolites and reactive oxygen species generated during PAH metabolism are detoxified by reactions involving glutathione (GSH). Early life exposures to tobacco smoke and air pollution have been linked to increased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. We investigated the independent and interactive effects of prenatal exposure to BaP and GSH deficiency due to deletion of the modifier subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclm), the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, on adiposity and hepatic steatosis in adult female F1 offspring. We mated Gclm(+/-) dams with Gclm(+/-) males and treated the pregnant dams with 0, 2, or 10mg/kg/day BaP in sesame oil by oral gavage daily from gestational day 7 through 16. We analyzed metabolic endpoints in female Gclm(-/-) and Gclm(+/+) littermate F1 offspring. Prenatal BaP exposure significantly increased visceral adipose tissue weight, weight gain between 3 weeks and 7.5 months of age, hepatic lipid content measured by oil red O staining, and hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation gene expression in Gclm(+/+), but not in Gclm(-/-), female offspring. Hepatic expression of lipid biosynthesis and antioxidant genes were decreased and increased, respectively, in Gclm(-/-) mice. Our results suggest that reported effects of pre- and peri-natal air pollution and tobacco smoke exposure on obesity may be mediated in part by PAHs. GSH deficiency is protective against the metabolic effects of prenatal BaP exposure.
Methadone is prescribed to heroin addicts to decrease illicit opioid use. Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes (TdP) has been reported in methadone users. As heroin addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many episodes of syncope to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of TdP in this special population, and the high mortality in this population may, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone.
In this cross-sectional study interview, ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult heroin addicts treated with methadone or buprenorphine on a daily basis. Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen, 450 (approximately 52%) were included. The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs. All participants were interviewed about any experience of syncope. The association between opioid dose and QT, and methadone dose and reporting of syncope was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively.
Methadone dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0.140 ms/mg (p = 0.002). No association between buprenorphine and QTc was found. Among the subjects treated with methadone, 28% men and 32% women had prolonged QTc interval. None of the subjects treated with buprenorphine had QTc interval >0.440 s((1/2)). A 50 mg higher methadone dose was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times higher odds for syncope.
Methadone is associated with QT prolongation and higher reporting of syncope in a population of heroin addicts.
Renal glycosuria associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been previously reported in two patients. A third patient was studied who developed isolated glycosuria associated with lisinopril therapy. As in the two previously described patients, this patient had a normal serum glucose level, underlying hypertension, and onset of glycosuria between 2 and 16 weeks after initiation of therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The patient had renal artery stenosis with elevated renin levels. Age, time until resolution of glycosuria, and a rise in serum creatinine level did not have a consistent relationship with glycosuria associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Since glycosuria was the only defect noted, without evidence of any other urinary solutes, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may exert an effect on the glucose-specific proximal tubule transport system.
There is increasing evidence that alcohol-induced liver damage may be associated with increased oxidative stress. We aimed to investigate free-radical scavenger effect of n-acetylcysteine in rats intragastrically fed with ethanol.
Twenty-four rats divided into three groups were fed with ethanol (6 g/kg/day, Group 1), ethanol and n-acetylcysteine (1 g/kg, Group 2), or isocaloric dextrose (control group, Group 3) for 4 weeks. Then animals were sacrificed under ether anesthesia, intracardiac blood and liver tissues were obtained. Measurements were performed both in serum and in homogenized liver tissues. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level was measured by TBARS method. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were studied by commercial kits. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis.
ALT and AST in Group 1 (154 U/L and 302 U/L, respectively) were higher than those in Group 2 (94 U/L and 155 U/L) and Group 3 (99 U/L and 168 U/L) (P=0.001 for both). Serum and tissue levels of MDA in Group 1 (1.84 nmol/mL and 96 nmol/100 mg-protein) were higher than Group 2 (0.91 nmol/mL and 64 nmol/100 mg-protein) and Group 3 (0.94 nmol/mL and 49 nmol/100 mg-protein) (P<0.001 for both). On the other hand, serum GSH-Px level in Group 1 (8.21 U/g-Hb) was lower than Group 2 (16 U/g-Hb) and Group 3 (16 U/g-Hb) (P<0.001). Serum and liver tissue levels of SOD in Group 1 (11 U/mL and 26 U/100 mg-protein) were lower than Group 2 (18 U/mL and 60 U/100 mg-protein) and Group 3 (20 U/mL and 60 U/100 mg-protein) (P<0.001 for both).
This study demonstrated that ethanol-induced liver damage is associated with oxidative stress, and co-administration of n-acetylcysteine attenuates this damage effectively in rat model.
Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) has a very flagitious treatment regime. A prodrug approach is thought to aid in targeting chemotherapy. CYP1B1, a member of cytochrome P450 family, has been implicated in chemical carcinogenesis. There exists a general accordance that this protein is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, making it an ideal candidate for a prodrug therapy. The activation of the prodrug facilitated by CYP1B1 would enable the targeting of chemotherapy to tumor tissues in which CYP1B1 is specifically overexpressed as a result reducing the non-specific side effects that the current chemotherapy elicits. This study was aimed at validating the use of CYP1B1 as a target for the prodrug therapy in OSCC. The expression profile of CYP1B1 was analysed in a panel of 51 OSCC tumors, their corresponding normal tissues, an epithelial dysplasia lesion and its matched normal tissue by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and Immunohistochemistry. CYP1B1 was found to be downregulated in 77.78% (28/36) tumor tissues in comparison to their corresponding normal tissues as well as in the epithelial dysplasia lesion compared to its matched normal tissue at the transcriptional level, and in 92.86% (26/28) of tumor tissues at the protein level. This report therefore clearly demonstrates the downregulation of CYP1B1 at the transcriptional and translational levels in tumor tissues in comparison to their corresponding normal tissues. These observations indicate that caution should be observed as this therapy may not be applicable universally to all cancers and also suggest the possibility of a prophylactic therapy for oral cancer.
TDGF1 (CRIPTO) is an EGF-CFC family member and an obligate co-receptor involved in NODAL signaling, a developmental program implicated in midline, forebrain, and left-right axis development in model organisms. Previous studies of CFC1 (CRYPTIC), another member of the EGF-CFC family, demonstrated that normal function of this protein is required for proper laterality development in humans. Here we identify a mutation in the conserved CFC domain of TDGF1 in a patient with midline anomalies of the forebrain. The mutant protein is inactive in a zebrafish rescue assay, indicating a role for TDGF1 in human midline and forebrain development.
Bacillary angiomatosis, a rare and possibly fatal disease, occurs mainly in HIV-infected patients. However, it has been reported in patients with cancer and in recipients of solid organs receiving immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine. This case report describes a 66-year-old man who came to dermatology practice in Clarksburg for an initial visit. He had a longstanding history of psoriasis and psoriatric arthritis treated with methotrexate. A biopsy of a skin lesion on his neck confirmed the diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis.
Atrazine (ATZ) is a widely used herbicide and is considered an endocrine disruptor of different organisms. However, the molecular interactions of ATZ with biological targets in mammalian endocrine systems are not understood fully. In the present study, we observed that ATZ administration (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) for 3 weeks to peripubertal male ICR mice exerted adverse effects on several physiological features; these effects included a significant decrease in the body and liver weights and an increase in the relative testis weight. In addition, the serum testosterone (T) concentration was significantly decreased in all ATZ-treated mice, and the serum estradiol (E2) concentration and aromatase activity were significantly increased in mice exposed to 100 and 200 mg/kg ATZ. These results suggest that ATZ exposure affected hormone homeostasis in male mice. We also found that the transcript levels of the steroidogenic enzyme genes p450scc, p450 17α1 and 17β-HSD were significantly reduced in the testes of mice exposed to 100 and 200 mg/kg ATZ for 3weeks. Given the results of the present study and previous reports, it is possible that ATZ reduces the T concentration in peripubertal male mice by affecting the transcription of steroidogenic genes, such as p450scc, p450 17a1 and 17β-HSD. This study provides new insights into the mammalian toxicological mechanism of ATZ.
We report a case of late stent thrombosis two years after implantation of a coronary stent graft (Jomed Covered Stent, CSG) and a week after cessation of aspirin therapy due to circumcision. Caution in adherence to anti-thrombotic therapy is warranted years following implantation of coronary stent grafts.
Bupropion is an antidepressant drug also used as a smoking cessation aid, which inhibits norepinephrine and dopamine re-uptake. Given its pharmacological properties, it has been associated with reports on psychosis and acute delirious episodes. Case We report the case of a patient with schizoaffective disorder who developed two psychotic episodes respectively after a four and a two-day administration of sustained-release (SR) bupropion at a dose of 150 mg/day. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of involuntary rechallenge with bupropion SR during a smoking cessation program. Conclusion There is a serious risk of incorrectly identifying bupropion as only a therapy for nicotine withdrawal without taking the precaution of exploring possible psychiatric co-morbidity with addiction. Our case illustrates the problem.
The aim of the study was to investigate the role of the ventromedial thalamic nucleus in the rigidity induced by morphine. Muscle rigidity was assessed using an electromyographic method (EMG) in non-anaesthesized rats with electrodes implanted unilaterally in the gastrocnemius soleus muscle. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of morphine in doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg evoked tonic EMG activity in the gastrocnemius soleus muscle; this was estimated as muscle rigidity. Picrotoxin was injected bilaterally into the ventromedial nucleus in doses of 50-400 ng/0.5 microliter 30 min after morphine administration. Picrotoxin in doses of 200 and 400 ng attenuated the tonic EMG activity induced by morphine, 10 mg/kg s.c. Picrotoxin in a dose of 400 ng reduced the tonic activity induced by morphine, 20 mg/kg s.c. The results suggest that the thalamic ventromedial nucleus mediates the morphine-induced rigidity.
Preganglionic sympathetic nerve activity, blood pressure, heart rate and femoral arterial conductance were recorded in anaesthetised, paralysed cats. Urapidil, doxazosin and alfuzosin were infused i.v. for 1 h into different animals at the rate of 2 mg kg-1 h-1. All three drugs caused a fall in thoracic preganglionic sympathetic nerve activity along with blood pressure. Although urapidil had a greater hypotensive action than doxazosin and alfuzosin its sympathoinhibitory action was delayed and weaker. Since all three drugs are alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists it appears that antagonism at this receptor type may cause central sympathoinhibition as well as a decrease in total peripheral resistance. However, the different effects of urapidil suggest that its action on central sympathetic tone and therefore its hypotensive action cannot be due entirely to its ability to block alpha 1-adrenoceptors.
Light-, electron microscopic and enzyme histochemical examinations (phosphorylase, LDH, NADH:TR, SDH and 3-HBDH) were performed on endomyocardial biopsies of 26 patients with heart diseases of unknown etiology. On the basis of the clinical findings the patients were grouped into hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients), dilated-congestive cardiomyopathy (8 patients), latent cardiomyopathy and small vessel disease (11 patients) and myocarditis (4 patients). Morphologic changes which might characterize the pathogenesis, were found in 7 patients: small vessel disease in 3 patients, nonspecific myocarditis in 1, iron storage disease in 1, adriamycin cardiomyopathy in 1 and cardiomyopathy with inclusions typical of Fabry's disease in 1 patient. In the other patients the morphologic changes were not sufficiently characteristic to be indicative of an etiopathogenesis. Several pathologic alterations did, nonetheless, appear to have a certain prognostic value such as endocardial and interstitial fibrosis, myofibrillolysis, myolysis, mitochondrial degeneration and increased lipid content in the muscle fibers. The frequency of these changes was evaluated partly semiquantitatively, partly by means of the point-counting method and graded with 1-3 points. Three patients with congestive cardiomyopathy scored at least 7 points. Two of them died within 8 weeks, 1 patient with adriamycin cardiomyopathy recovered after discontinuation of the therapy but he died 4 years after the biopsy. Six to 50 months after the biopsy (mean 31.5, median 6.5) the score was less than 7 in the other patients and all these patients were still alive. The histochemical changes manifested as an increase and/or a decrease of the enzymatic activities, involving scattered muscle fibers or their segments. A decrease of the activities of all dehydrogenases examined appeared to be prognostically ominous, correlating with a score of 7 or higher. A decrease of SDH activity in 7 cases, in combination with a decrease of the HBDH activity in 4 of them, was indicative of a disturbance in the Krebs cycle and lipid metabolism in the absence of ischemic damage. The alterations in the phosphorylase activity did not, however, appear to have a prognostic significance. Normal activity of the phosphorylase seemed to be prognostically favorable.
A young man with dermatitis herpetiformis developed fatigue and neurologic complaints 4 years after he began oral dapsone therapy. Neurologic examination and nerve conduction studies confirmed the presence of a combined motor and sensory peripheral neuropathy. The symptomatic improvement reported by the patient was supported by improvement in the nerve conduction studies after cessation of dapsone therapy. Substitution of sulfapyridine did not adversely affect the resolution of his neuropathy.
Comparison of the ease of upper endoscopy, patient tolerance, and amnestic effect, using diazepam, midazolam, or no sedation, was performed on 149 patients. Midazolam and diazepam sedation produced better conditions and improved patient acceptability. Midazolam was associated with better patient tolerance, less thrombophlebitis, and more amnesia than diazepam, but shared a similar recovery time. Midazolam should replace diazepam as the drug of choice in those patients requiring sedation for upper endoscopy.
Copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) is an essential primary antioxidant enzyme that converts superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen in the cytoplasm. Cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (GPx) converts hydrogen peroxide into water. The overall goal of the present study was to explore the possible role of the antioxidant enzyme CuZnSOD in expression of the malignant phenotype. We hypothesized that overexpression of CuZnSOD would lead to the suppression of at least part of the human malignant phenotype. To test this hypothesis, human CuZnSOD cDNA was transfected into U118-9 human malignant glioma cells. CuZnSOD activity levels increased 1.5-, 2.0-, 2.6-, and 3.5-fold, respectively, in four table transfected cell lines compared with wild type and vector controls. Overexpression of CuZnSOD altered cellular antioxidant enzyme profiles, including those of manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, and GPx. The transfected clone with the highest CuZnSOD:GPx ratio (3.5) showed a 42% inhibition of tumor cell growth in vitro. The decreased rate of tumor cell growth in vitro was strongly correlated with the enzyme activity ratio of CuZnSOD:GPx. Glioma cells that stably overexpressed CuZnSOD demonstrated additional suppressive effects on the malignant phenotype when compared with the parental cells and vector controls. These cells showed decreased plating efficiency, elongated cell population doubling time, lower clonogenic fraction in soft agar, and, more significantly, inhibition of tumor formation in nude mice. This work suggested that CuZnSOD is a new tumor suppressor gene. Increased intracellular ROS levels were found in cells with high activity ratios of CuZnSOD:GPx. Change in the cellular redox status, especially change attributable to the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide or other hydroperoxides, is a possible reason to explain the suppression of tumor growth observed in CuZnSOD-overexpressing cells.
Levodopa (L-DOPA), the gold standard treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), eventually causes L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in up to 80% of patients. In the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD, L-DOPA induces a similar phenomenon, which has been termed abnormal involuntary movement (AIM). We previously demonstrated that BMY-14802 suppresses AIM expression in this model.
Although BMY-14802 is widely used as a sigma-1 antagonist, it is also an agonist at serotonin (5-HT) 1A and adrenergic alpha-1 receptors. The current study was conducted to determine which of these mechanisms underlies BMY-14802's AIM-suppressing effect. This characterization included testing the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone and multiple sigma agents. When these studies implicated a 5-HT1A mechanism, we subsequently undertook a pharmacological reversal study, evaluating whether the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 counteracted BMY-14802's AIM-suppressing effects.
Buspirone dose-dependently suppressed AIM, supporting past findings. However, no AIM-suppressing effects were produced by drugs with effects at sigma receptors, including BD-1047, finasteride, SM-21, DTG, trans-dehydroandrosterone (DHEA), carbetapentane, and opipramol. Finally, we show for the first time that the AIM-suppressing effect of BMY-14802 was dose-dependently prevented by WAY-100635 but not by the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin.
BMY-14802 exerts its AIM-suppressing effects via a 5-HT1A agonist mechanism, similar to buspirone. Other 5-HT1A agonists have failed clinical trials, possibly due to submicromolar affinity at other receptors, including D2, which may exacerbate PD symptoms. BMY-14802 is a promising candidate for clinical trials due to its extremely low affinity for the D2 receptor and lack of extrapyramidal effects during prior clinical trials for schizophrenia.
Pharmacologic therapy is widely used for restoration of sinus rhythm and prevention of recurrences of atrial fibrillation. Because concerns have been raised about their potential proarrhythmic effects, therapeutic regimens should be evaluated by placebo-controlled studies to determine their efficacy and safety. One hundred thirty-six patients with persistent atrial fibrillation were randomized to receive propafenone 2 mg/kg over 30 minutes, followed by oral propafenone 150 mg 3 times daily or matching placebo. Nonresponders to intravenous therapy underwent direct-current cardioversion. Both responders to intravenous therapy and converters to sinus rhythm after direct-current cardioversion were followed for 6 months in a double-blind oral treatment period of propafenone 150 mg 3 times daily or matching placebo. Pharmacologic conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 29% of the patients taking propafenone and in 17% of patients taking placebo (p > or = 0.10). Subsequent direct-current cardioversion in nonresponders was equally successful (70%) in both groups (p > or = 0.10). The proportion of patients free from recurrent symptomatic arrhythmia at 6 months was 67% for the propafenone and 35% for the placebo group (p < 0.01). Time to atrial fibrillation relapse was more favorable with propafenone than with placebo (p < 0.001). The incidence of drug-related side effects was 10% in the propafenone group and 14% in the placebo group. Thus, "slow" infusion of propafenone seems to be of limited value for terminating atrial fibrillation. Oral propafenone at a low dosage 150 mg 3 times daily is well tolerated and effective in maintaining sinus rhythm for 6 months after pharmacologic or electrical restoration of sinus rhythm.
Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) is frequently present in indoor dust and can be detected in human milk. In order to evaluate the effects of TDCPP on vertebrate development, zebrafish embryos/larvae were used as an animal model to examine developmental phenotypes and explore possible mechanisms of toxicity by employing microarrays and iTRAQ labeling quantitative proteomics. The results demonstrated that treatment with TDCPP (3 μM) from 0.75 h postfertilization (hpf) inhibited cell rearrangement at 4 hpf, caused delay in epiboly at 5.7 and 8.5 hpf, and led to abnormal development (e.g., short tail, reduced body size) and lethality between 14 and 45 hpf, which might be related with altered expression of genes regulating embryogenesis. Furthermore, trunk curvature was observed as the main phenotype in 96 hpf zebrafish larvae exposed to 1 or 3 μM TDCPP, possibly by changing somite formation and expression of proteins related to fast muscle and cartilage development. Collectively, our results suggest that exposure to TDCPP causes developmental toxicity in vertebrates and warrant the need for studies to evaluate the potential health risks of TDCPP to developing human embryos/infants/children, due to its frequent presence in indoor dust and potential for human exposure.
Over a 24-month period we evaluated 14 patients with neurologic disease associated with cocaine abuse. Five patients developed previously unreported complications: anterior spinal artery syndrome, lateral medullary syndrome, transient ischemic attacks in the middle cerebral artery and vertebrobasilar artery territories, and partial motor seizures. The recent availability of crack has led to a great increase in neurologic problems associated with the use of this drug.
In a 1 year period, 13 patients underwent pump implantation for liver metastasis from a primary colorectal tumor. The gallbladders were not removed at the time of pump implantation in the initial six patients. In these patients, chemotherapy consisted of floxuridine given every 2 weeks followed by a 2 week rest period and cisplatin over 1 hour by way of the side portal on day 8 of the cycle. The treatment was repeated every 28 days. All patients whose gallbladders were not removed at the time of pump implantation required reoperation for acute or chronic acalculous cholecystitis from 1 to 9 months (mean 5.4 months) after pump implantation. At operation, all patients were found to have various degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. In one patient, significant sclerosing cholangitis was documented that involved the entire intrahepatic ductal system and hepatic duct bifurcation. Cholecystectomy and operative cholangiography are recommended in all patients who undergo pump implantation for metastatic disease to the liver.
A medical hypothesis has suggested that some autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) may result from interactions between the methionine cycle-transsulfuration and androgen pathways following exposure to mercury.
The IRB of the Institute for Chronic Illnesses approved the present study. A novel treatment was utilized combining LUPRON (leuprolide acetate, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and CHEMET (meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid--DMSA, McNeil Consumer Products Company) on 11 consecutive children with ASDs.
A significant (p<0.01) overall improvement from the 70-79th percentile of severity (median baseline score=87) at baseline to the 40-49th percentile of severity (median end of study period score=63) at the end of the study was observed for patients treated for a median of approximately 4 months. Significant improvements in sociability, cognitive awareness, behavior, and clinical symptoms/behaviors of hyperandrogenemia were also observed. Significant decreases in blood androgens and increases in urinary heavy metal concentrations were observed. Minimal drug adverse effects were found.
This study provides the first clinical evidence for the benefit that combined anti-androgen and anti-heavy metal therapy may have on some children with ASDs. Additional studies should examine androgen and heavy metal mechanisms of action in ASDs, and future ASD treatment protocols should consider androgens and heavy metals.
The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in dialyzed patients is estimated around 5-20% of the cases. This explains the high use of antidepressant drugs in these patients. We present the case of a 68-year-old woman with a history of renal failure, with chronic hemodialysis and a depressive syndrome in treatment with Mirtazapine. In November 2008, the patient received a renal graft. An immunosuppressant treatment was started with Basiliximab, Tacrolimus, Mycophenolate Mofetil, and corticosteroids. The patient did not present renal immediate renal function. Four days after the transplant, the treatment with Mirtazapine was re-applied, with an asymptomatic hypotension after 2 hours, and without surgical complications. Tacrolimus blood levels were higher than 15 ng/ml. In our opinion, hypotension was a consequence of the interaction Mirtazapine-Tacrolimus in a patient without immediate renal function. This situation has not been described in the literature before, and hypotension could have had negative consequences in the evolution of the graft.
Neuroplasticity has been investigated considering the neuronal growth-associated phosphoprotein as a marker of neuronal adaptive capabilities. In the present work, studying the hippocampal reorganization observed in the epilepsy model induced by pilocarpine, we carried out quantitative western blotting associated with immunohistochemistry to determine the distribution of growth-associated phosphoprotein in the hippocampus of rats in acute, silent and chronic periods of this epilepsy model. The fibers and punctate elements from the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were strongly immunostained in animals killed 5 h after status epilepticus, compared with the same region in control animals. Rats presenting partial seizures showed no alterations in the immunostaining pattern compared with saline-treated animals. The hippocampal dentate gyrus of animals during the seizure-free period and presenting spontaneous recurrent seizures was also characterized by strong growth-associated phosphoprotein immunostaining of fibers and punctate elements in the inner molecular layer, contrasting with the control group. As determined by western blotting analysis, growth-associated phosphoprotein levels increased following status epilepticus and remained elevated at the later time-points, both during the silent period and during the period of chronic recurring seizures. Pilocarpine-treated animals, which did not develop status epilepticus, showed no change in growth-associated phosphoprotein levels, indicating that status epilepticus is important to induce growth-associated phosphoprotein overexpression. The measurement of this overexpression could represent one of the early signals of hippocampal reorganization due to status epilepticus-induced damage.
While most deaths from asphyxia related to buprenorphine (BUP) overdose have been reported in males, higher plasma concentrations of BUP and its toxic metabolite norbuprenorphine (NBUP) have been observed in females. We previously demonstrated that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) modulation at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) contributes highly to BUP-related respiratory toxicity, by limiting NBUP entrance into the brain. In this work, we sought to investigate the role of P-gp-mediated transport at the BBB in gender and strain-related variability of BUP and NBUP-induced respiratory effects in mice. Ventilation was studied using plethysmography, P-gp expression using western blot, and transport at the BBB using in situ cerebral perfusion. In male Fvb and Swiss mice, BUP was responsible for ceiling respiratory effects. NBUP-related reduction in minute volume was dose-dependent but more marked in Fvb (p<0.01 at 1mg/kg NBUP and p<0.001 at 3 and 9mg/kg NBUP) than in Swiss mice (p<0.001 at 9mg/kg NBUP). Female Fvb mice were more susceptible to BUP than males with significantly increased inspiratory time (p<0.05) and to NBUP with significantly increased expiratory time (p<0.01). Following BUP administration, plasma BUP concentrations were significantly higher (p<0.01) and plasma NBUP concentrations significantly lower (p<0.001) in Fvb mice compared to Swiss mice. Plasma BUP concentrations were significantly higher (p<0.05) and plasma NBUP concentrations significantly lower (p<0.01) in male compared to female Fvb mice. In contrast, following NBUP administration, comparable plasma NBUP concentrations were observed in both genders and strains. No differences in P-gp expression or BUP and NBUP transport across the BBB were observed between male and female Fvb mice as well as between Swiss and Fvb mice. Our results suggest that P-gp-mediated transport across the BBB does not play a key-role in gender and strain-related variability in BUP and NBUP-induced respiratory toxicity in mice. Both gender- and strain-related differences in respiratory effects of BUP could be attributed to BUP itself rather than to its metabolite, NBUP.
