Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given daily oral doses of sodium warfarin (100 mg/kg) and concurrent intramuscular injections of vitamin K1 (10 mg/kg). This dosing regimen did not have any apparent deleterious effect on the dams and did not affect the fetuses when administered from day 1 to day 12 of pregnancy. However, similar treatment from day 9 to 20 caused hemorrhage in the fetuses examined on day 21 of gestation. There were no hemorrhages in the control fetuses from dams receiving vitamin K1 only. The lowest effective dose of warfarin, in conjunction with daily doses of vitamin K1, was 3 mg/kg. This dose caused hemorrhage in 28% of fetuses; the incidence of affected fetuses was not further increased by doses of warfarin up to 100 mg/kg. Hemorrhages affected the fetal brain, face, eyes, and ear and occasionally the limbs. Brain hemorrhages were frequently intraventricular and caused various degrees of hydrocephaly. Bony defects were not a feature of prenatal exposure to warfarin. These results show that prenatal exposure of the rat to warfarin and vitamin K duplicates the hemorrhagic abnormalities and pathology associated with prenatal exposure to warfarin in the human. It did not induce bony or facial defects probably because the vitamin K-dependent components of bone development occur postnatally in the rat. This model should allow detailed determination of the role of vitamin K-dependent proteins in development.
We investigated the effect of long-term, low-dose ACTH in 13 patients (10 boys and 3 girls) with infantile spasms who were treated with low-dose ACTH (mean: 0.0081 mg/kg/day). Two patients (one boy and one girl) received this therapy twice because of relapse of tonic spasms. ACTH was injected intramuscularly every morning for 30 days, after which dosage was tapered. The mean observation period was 53.9 months. Complete cessation of seizures was attained in 13 of 15 treatment trials. In one trial, complete cessation was not attained but the number of attacks decreased to less than one-third of that before treatment. In only one trial was treatment not effective. EEG showed good response to this treatment. The side-effects of this therapy were hypertension in 6 patients, hypokalemia in 7, and emotional outburst in 7. Emotional outburst appeared during the early phase of therapy, while the other two side-effects appeared in the later phase and disappeared when ACTH-tapering was begun. Brain shrinkage observed on CT scan was mild in all trials. Five patients have had no relapse. The total dose of ACTH was significantly larger in the group with good outcome than in the group with poor outcome.
Two children developed multiorgan dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation 9 days after lamotrigine was added to their antiepileptic therapy, which included valproic acid. During the episodes, rhabdomyolysis was detected in one of them, while being seizure-free, suggesting that this adverse reaction may involve muscular tissue.
Tetracycline generally is believed to be a safe drug with relatively minor side effects. Serious irreversible renal damage and metabolic acidosis can occur in patients with azotemia. While the exact mechanism is unknown, the commonly reported nephrotoxic and metabolic effects of tetracycline are reviewed and an illustrative case is presented.
Using a randomized double-blind protocol, the authors prospectively compared three nondepolarizing muscle relaxants with respect to their influence on hemodynamics and on the electrocardiogram. Thirty-three patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with high-dose (100 micrograms/kg) fentanyl anesthesia were studied. Patients received 1.5 X ED95 of either pancuronium (n = 12), metocurine (n = 9), or a metocurine-pancuronium combination (4:1 ratio by weight) (n = 12) for muscle relaxation. Heart rate and rate pressure product (RPP) were significantly higher postinduction in the pancuronium group. Myocardial ischemia, indicated by new ECG ST-segment depression occurred significantly more frequently, and exclusively, in the pancuronium group. The authors' data suggest that since pancuronium is associated with tachycardia and an increased incidence of myocardial ischemia, it is best avoided in patients with severe coronary artery disease undergoing CABG with high-dose fentanyl. Either metocurine or the metocurine-pancuronium combination provides greater hemodynamic stability, without precipitating myocardial ischemia, and can be safely and effectively substituted for pancuronium.
The first case of an obstructing stone composed of a pure metabolite of the sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination is reported. Its coincident occurrence with an obstructing calcium oxalate stone, producing oligura and acute azotemia, is noteworthy.
Attachment status of children exposed in utero to cocaine, opiates, and other substances was examined at 18 months (n=860) and 36 months (n=732) corrected age. Children exposed to cocaine and opiates had slightly lower rates of attachment security (but not disorganization), and their insecurity was skewed toward ambivalent, rather than avoidant, strategies. Continued postnatal alcohol use was associated with higher rates of insecurity and disorganization at 18, but not 36, months of age. Stability of attachment across the 18-month period was barely above chance expectation. Attachment status at 18 months was associated with child temperament and caregiver-child interaction; at 36 months, attachment was associated with child temperament, child behavior problems, and caregivers' parenting self-esteem.
Two companion post-marketing studies have evaluated the frequency of adverse events amongst patients receiving atracurium. In this second report, we describe the Scottish study and discuss findings in both centres. In this study we compare the frequency of adverse events in 477 patients receiving atracurium with those in 484 patients who received vecuronium. The frequency of reported serious adverse events was low during surgery and in the recovery room. Although the overall incidence of adverse experiences was slightly lower after atracurium, there were no significant difference between the groups in frequency of major adverse events. This type of study is believed to be of value in the future surveillance of new drugs for hospital use.
Azathioprine metabolism is influenced by activity of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), which varies markedly between individuals. In this study we examined the influence of TPMT gene polymorphisms on azathioprine dose 1 year after renal transplantation. TPMT coding and promoter genotypes were determined using PCR-based assays. Azathioprine dose, white cell count, and intercurrent events throughout the first year after renal transplantation were ascertained from contemporaneous clinical notes. All patients analysed ( n=172) received an initial azathioprine dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Twelve individuals with one variant TPMT coding allele were detected (*3A n=11, *3C n=1). Of these, 58% required azathioprine dose reduction because of leucopenia, compared to only 30% of homozygous wild-type patients ( P=0.04). A significant correlation between the presence of >/=11 variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) in the TPMT promoter and reduction in azathioprine dose was also identified ( P=0.001). We concluded that when azathioprine is administered at an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day, both coding and promoter TPMT polymorphisms influence the dose tolerated.
Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disorder, which is characterized by the accumulation of activated CD4+ T lymphocytes (T cells) at disease sites. There is up-regulation of cell surface expression of MHC molecules in sarcoidosis, and it has been suggested that specific MHC class II alleles are associated with the disease. A study of chronic beryllium disease (CBD), a granulomatous disorder which is pathologically similar to sarcoidosis, has identified an association between this disease and the presence of a glutamine residue at position 69 (Glu 69+) of the B1 chain of the HLA-DPB molecule. A further study also suggested the importance of Glu at position 55 of the same chain. The aims of the present study were to attempt to define MHC class II alleles associated with sarcoidosis by comparison of their frequency in two groups of subjects and to compare the frequency of HLA-DPB1 Glu 69+/- and Glu 55+/-alleles in the same subjects. Forty-one subjects with sarcoidosis and 76 normal subjects were studied. The polymorphic regions of the class II MHC were identified by PCR in association with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. There were no significant differences in the phenotype frequencies of MHC class II or Glu 55+ alleles between the two groups of subjects. However, there was a significant increase (P = 0.02) in the frequency of HLA-DPB1* Glu 69+ alleles compared with the control population. We therefore suggest that the presence of a Glu residue at position 69 on the DPB1 chain may play an important role in antigen presentation and recognition in chronic granulomatous diseases.
Humans and other mammals such as rats exhibit a genetic polymorphism in acetyltransferase (NAT2) capacity, yielding rapid and slow acetylator phenotypes. The rapid acetylator phenotype has been associated with increased incidence of human colorectal cancer in some, but not all, epidemiological studies. In order to investigate this possible association, a rapid (F-344) and slow (WKY) acetylator inbred rat model was utilized to investigate the role of the acetylator genotype (NAT2) in the formation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) following administration of colon carcinogens. Age-matched (retired breeder) female rapid and slow acetylator inbred rats received two weekly injections (50 or 100 mg/kg, sc) of 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMABP) or a single 50 mg/kg, sc, injection of 1,2-dimethyl-hydrazine (DMH). The rats were euthanized at 10 weeks and ACF were evaluated in the cecum, ascending, transverse, and descending colon, and rectum. ACF were observed in the colon and rectum, but not the cecum of rapid and slow acetylator inbred rats administered DMABP or DMH. ACF were more concentrated in the descending colon. ACF frequencies were significantly higher in colons of rapid than slow acetylator inbred rats administered DMABP, a colon carcinogen which is activated via O-acetylation catalyzed by polymorphic acetyltransferase (NAT2). At 50 mg/kg, ACF frequency in the distal colon was 2.29 +/- 0.57 in rapid acetylators versus 0.38 +/- 0.18 in slow acetylators. At 100 mg/kg, ACF frequency was 4.11 +/- 1.06 in rapid versus 1.57 +/- 0.48 in slow acetylators. ACF frequency did not differ significantly between rapid and slow acetylator inbred rats administered DMH, a colon carcinogen which is not metabolized by polymorphic acetyltransferase. The two inbred rat strains did not differ in hepatic microsomal phenacetin deethylase activity, which is a marker for CYP1A2 activity important for the activation of aromatic amines. These results support the hypothesis that rapid acetylator (NAT2) genotype is a risk factor in aromatic amine-induced colon carcinogenesis.
Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is an important cause of strokes and heart failure among the elderly, but it is difficult to control in some elderly patients, even with combination antihypertensive therapy. The presence of a prominent reflection wave in the arterial pulse-wave profile of such patients signifies that adjuvant nitrate therapy may prove effective in lowering pulse pressure. This reflection arises in the muscular arteries and is caused by arterial stiffness associated with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, probably including endothelial dysfunction. By acting directly on the arterial wall, nitrates produce endothelium-independent vasorelaxation. The reflection wave and the contribution this makes to pulse pressure are thereby ablated. Controlled trials of the use of isosorbide mononitrate and isosorbide dinitrate in ISH have shown that these agents decrease systolic blood pressure as well as pulse pressure, and with the mononitrate, efficacy appears to be unimpaired by nitrate tolerance.
5-Fluorouracil remains a major component of chemotherapy regimens for various tumors. We report the case of reversible cardiogenic shock following 5-FU administration and discuss the different pitfalls of such toxicity. Oncologist should be aware of that rare but potentially lethal adverse event.
We report the case of a patient who had development of ventricular fibrillation following rapid intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate (2 g over 5 s) for treatment of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Initial slowing of the tachycardia was followed by gradual widening of QRS complexes and electrical alternans, leading to ventricular fibrillation within 3 min of magnesium administration.
Methylnitrosourea (MNU) is a potent carcinogen and teratogen that is associated with central nervous system, craniofacial, skeletal, ocular, and appendicular birth defects following transplacental exposure at critical time points during development, and preliminary studies have suggested that nonspecific maternal immunostimulation may offer protection against development of these birth defects.
Our study examined morphologic alterations in fetal limb and digital development and placental integrity following maternal exposure to MNU on GD 9 in CD-1 mice, and characterized the improvement in placental integrity and abrogation of fetal defects following maternal immune stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on GD 7.
Fetal limbs were significantly shortened (p < 0.0001) and incidence of limb and digital defects (syndactyly, polydactyly, oligodactyly, clubbing, and webbing) was dramatically increased following mid-gestational maternal MNU exposure. Maternal immune stimulation with IFN-gamma on GD 7 lessened incidence of fetal limb shortening and maldevelopment on GD 12 and 14. Further, disruption of placental spongiotrophoblast integrity, increased cell death in placental trophoblasts with increased intercellular spaces in the spongiotrophoblast layer and minimal inflammation, and increased loss of fetal labyrinthine endothelial cells from MNU-exposed dams suggested that MNU-induced placental breakdown may contribute to fetal limb and digital maldevelopment. MNU + IFN-gamma was associated with diminished cell death within all layers of the placenta, especially in the labyrinthine layer.
These data verify improved distal limb development in MNU-exposed mice as a result of maternal IFN-gamma administration, and suggest a link between placental integrity and proper fetal development.
Two female patients have been described in whom peripheral vasculitis with cold sensitivity preceded by about 5 years typical symptoms of aspirin-induced asthma. Vasculitis was immunologically mediated and took the form of either limited cutaneous scleroderma or perniosis. Antinuclear autoantibodies of SS-B specificity were present in the serum. Challenge with aspirin provoked asthma and distinct blood circulation disturbance in the hands. It is speculated that in these patients vasculitis and asthma were causally linked, and leukotrienes mediated bronchial and vascular reactions that occurred simultaneously following aspirin administration.
Nitrosamine compounds are known hepatic carcinogens. In the metabolism of nitrosamines, such as N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), there is evidence of the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in oxidative stress, which may be one of the factors in the etiology of cancer. The formation of ROS may alter the antioxidant system, while the presence of Vitamin E may counteract NDEA induced oxidative stress. This study was planned to determine whether pre-treatment with Vitamin E (40 mg/kg body weight, i.p., twice a week for 4 weeks) to NDEA induced rats provides protection against oxidative stress in liver caused by the carcinogen. A single necrogenic dose of NDEA (200mg/kg body weight) was administered i.p. to the male albino rats with or without Vitamin E pre-treatment and the animals were sacrificed on Days 7, 14 or 21 after the administration of NDEA. The result showed enhanced levels of hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) and conjugated dienes of NDEA treated rats as the indices of oxidative stress, however, Vitamin E pre-treated rats administered NDEA showed decreased LPO and conjugated dienes (Day 21). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in liver was not altered significantly in NDEA treated rats with or without Vitamin E pre-treatment. Catalase (CAT) activity was inhibited with NDEA treatment, however, Vitamin E pre-treatment showed recovery in hepatic CAT activity (Days 14 and 21). Total and Se-glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in liver increased in NDEA treated rats irrespective of Vitamin E pre-treatment. Glutathione reductase (GSH-R) activity as well as total glutathione (GSH) content in liver decreased in NDEA treated animals, both of which were recovered in Vitamin E pre-treated rats administered NDEA. Activities of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were increased significantly following NDEA treatment to rats with or without Vitamin E pre-treatment. The activities of AST and ALT enzymes were significantly reduced on Days 14 and 21 and ALP activity was reduced on Day 21 in NDEA+Vitamin E treated animals when compared to NDEA treated alone. LDH enzyme activity was normalized on Day 14 in Vitamin E pre-treated animals administered NDEA. However, the AST, ALT and ALP enzyme activities remained high in all treatment groups as compared to control group. Normal control and Vitamin E treated alone rats revealed normal histology of liver. On the other hand, NDEA treated animals showed alterations in normal hepatic histoarchitecture, which comprised of necrosis and vacuolization of the cells. However, the rats treated with Vitamin E+NDEA showed that the liver cells were normal, with very little necrosis (Day 21). This study concludes that the pre-treatment with Vitamin E prior to the administration of NDEA, reduced the degree of oxidative stress, although this vitamin produced only slight changes in the hepatic injury, in a time-dependent manner.
Although M-VAC therapy is a standard chemotherapy for advanced transitional cell carcinoma, the treatment schedule has to be delayed or cancelled in many patients because of the toxicity. To reduce the toxicity we modified the treatment schedule of M-VAC treatment. The dosages of this simplified M-VAC therapy were 30 mg/m2 methotrexate (on day 1), 3 mg/m2 vinblastine (on day 2), 30 mg/m2 doxorubicin (on day 2) and 70 mg/m2 cisplatin (on day 2), with courses repeated every 21 days for four cycles as a principle. Seventeen patients with histologically proven advanced transitional cell carcinoma were treated with this simplified M-VAC therapy without dose modification or delay. The median number of cycles was 4. Neutropenia, anemia and thrombopenia (grade 4) was observed in 2, 1 and 2 patients respectively, but no drug-related deaths were observed. Complete response and partial response were achieved in 2 (12%) and 10 (59%) patients respectively. Of 2 complete responders one patient was alive without evidence of disease at 12 months and another patient died of the disease at 42 months. Of 10 partial responders 6 patients underwent the additional surgical resection of residual tumors. Of these 6 patients 3 patients are alive without evidence of disease at 6, 30 and 31 months. The remaining 3 developed recurrence and 2 died of the disease at 13 and 29 months. Five non-responders died of the disease at 5 months after the start of the therapy. Response rate of simplified M-VAC therapy was excellent and treatment duration was short. However, relapses were commonly observed as well as the original M-VAC treatment.
Drugs that alter brain serotonin (5-HT) function can modulate the behavioral effects of cocaine, but the underlying receptor mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study examined the effects of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.01-0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) on cocaine self-administration in the context of a choice procedure. Five adult male cynomolgus monkeys self-administered cocaine (saline, 0.003-0.03 mg/kg per injection) under a concurrent fixed-ratio 50 schedule of food (1-g banana-flavored pellets) and cocaine presentation. Allocation of responses to the cocaine-associated lever (cocaine choice) increased in a dose-related manner from < or =20% of total responses when saline or 0.003 mg/kg per injection cocaine was the alternative to food to > or =75% when 0.03 mg/kg per injection cocaine was available. In four of five monkeys, when choice was between a low cocaine dose and food, 0.01 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT increased injection-lever responding. At cocaine doses which occasioned > or =75% cocaine choice, 8-OH-DPAT did not alter response allocation. In the fifth monkey, 8-OH-DPAT only decreased injection-lever responding. When choice was between saline and food, 8-OH-DPAT did not reliably shift responding to the injection lever, except at doses that disrupted operant performance. These results suggest that a 5-HT1A receptor agonist can increase the reinforcing strength of a low cocaine dose relative to a concurrently available non-drug reinforcer.
A 36-year-old man presented with a prolonged history of chest pain, and was given two sublingual nitroglycerin tablets. Subsequently, the patient became hypotensive, bradycardiac, apneic, and lost consciousness. The bradycardia resolved spontaneously. No evidence for acute myocardial infarction or ischemic disease was found. Thirty-four cases reported to date are reviewed, demonstrating that this response appears to be an independent effect of nitroglycerin taken in any form, in patients with and without myocardial infarction and to be unpredictable, especially without evidence of inferior or right ventricular infarction. Careful monitoring is warranted when administering nitroglycerin.
A health questionnaire based on parental observations of clinical signs of fatty acid deficiency (FAD) showed that patients with autism and Asperger's syndrome (ASP) had significantly higher FAD scores (6.34+/-4.37 and 7.64+/-6.20, respectively) compared to controls (1.78+/-1.68). Patients with regressive autism had significantly higher percentages of 18:0,18:2n-6 and total saturates in their RBC membranes compared to controls, while 24:0, 22:5n-6, 24:1 and the 20:4n-6/20:5n-3 ratio were significantly higher in both regressive autism and ASP groups compared to controls. By comparison, the 18:1n-9 and 20:4n-6 values were significantly lower in patients with regressive autism compared to controls while 22:5n-3, total n-3 and total dimethyl acetals were significantly lower in both regressive autism and ASP groups compared to controls. Storage of RBC at -20 degrees C for 6 weeks resulted in significant reductions in highly unsaturated fatty acid levels in polar lipids of patients with regressive autism, compared to patients with classical autism or ASP, or controls. Patients diagnosed with both autism and ASP showed significantly increased levels of EPA ( approximately 200%) and DHA ( approximately 40%), and significantly reduced levels of ARA ( approximately 20%), 20:3n-6 and ARA/EPA ratio in their RBC polar lipids, when supplemented with EPA-rich fish oils, compared to controls and non-supplemented patients with autism. Patients with both regressive autism and classical autism/Asperger's syndrome had significantly higher concentrations of RBC type IV phospholipase A2 compared to controls. However, patients with autism/ASP, who had taken EPA supplements, had significantly reduced PLA2 concentrations compared to unsupplemented patients with classical autism or ASP.
Genistein and apigenin are phytoestrogens present in commercial preparations used for the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms. In this study, we assessed the influence of these compounds on mammary tumor growth. Both compounds stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 and T47D cells [estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha-positive)], but do not stimulate the proliferation of an ERalpha-negative cell line (MDA-MB-435 cells). Genistein appeared more efficient in this regard due to its higher binding affinity for ERalpha, a property explained by a structural analysis of the binding of these compounds to the ERalpha's ligand binding domain. As previously described for estradiol (E(2)), genistein and apigenin down regulated ERalpha and enhanced estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent gene expression. The additional finding that genistein antagonizes the anti-proliferative effect of hydroxytamoxifen suggests phytoestrogens may be detrimental in women with breast cancer who are being treated with tamoxifen. In addition, because of their ability to stimulate breast cell growth, the widespread use of phytoestrogens in postmenopausal women could be detrimental.
A 31-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis, who had previously been treated with sulindac, fenoprofen calcium, high dose salicylates and gold salts, developed renal papillary necrosis (RPN) 4 months after institution of naproxen therapy. No other factor predisposing to RPN could be discovered. Sulindac was substituted for naproxen and no further adverse renal effects occurred over the next 12 months. We review previous reports linking RPN to antiinflammatory drug use and discuss possible advantages of sulindac in patients who have experienced renal toxicity from other antiinflammatory agents.
The effect of continuing penicillamine or gold treatment was examined in 53 patients with biopsy proven penicillamine (32) or gold (21) nephropathy. Thirty-two patients stopped penicillamine or gold treatment as soon as proteinuria was detected whilst 21 patients continued treatment for periods of 2-11 months. The 24-hour creatinine clearance and urinary protein excretion were measured serially for a median period of 6 years. No significant differences were observed in the initial or maximum proteinuria, the duration of the proteinuria or in the initial or latest creatinine clearances between the groups of patients. These results indicate that penicillamine or gold treatment may be continued for short periods under close supervision despite moderate proteinuria without causing permanent renal damage. As several alternative non-nephrotoxic agents are available for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, continued treatment with penicillamine or gold despite proteinuria is seldom indicated.
We examined the association of dietary lignan intake with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and ER positive (ER+) breast cancer risk in a breast cancer case-control study. Among premenopausal women only, there was a reduced risk of ER- breast cancer for those in the highest compared to the lowest quartile of lignan intake suggesting that the observed negative association of lignans with breast cancer may be limited to ER- tumors.
Deficiency in the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI is the etiological origin of Netherton syndrome, which causes detachment of the stratum corneum and chronic inflammation. Here we show that the membrane protease matriptase initiates Netherton syndrome in a LEKTI-deficient mouse model by premature activation of a pro-kallikrein cascade. Auto-activation of pro-inflammatory pro-kallikrein-related peptidases that are associated with stratum corneum detachment was either low or undetectable, but they were efficiently activated by matriptase. Ablation of matriptase from LEKTI-deficient mice dampened inflammation, eliminated aberrant protease activity, prevented detachment of the stratum corneum, and improved the barrier function of the epidermis. These results uncover a pathogenic matriptase-pro-kallikrein pathway that could operate in several human skin and inflammatory diseases.
Calcium channel blockers as a group are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality with toxic exposures. Isradipine, a cardioselective dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, rarely has been implicated, with only two reports in the literature of significant toxic reactions, one in an adult and another in a child. To our knowledge, we describe the first case of life-threatening isradipine poisoning in a child and provide documentation of serum drug levels. On arrival at the hospital, a 5-year-old girl had abdominal distention and bradycardia that rapidly progressed to asystole. She received 73 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and transvenous cardiac pacing and survived with an intact neurologic recovery. Serum concentrations of isradipine were 30-100 times those found with therapeutic use.
