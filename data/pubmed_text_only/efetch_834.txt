Cadmium (Cd) toxicity of the kidney varies between individuals despite similar exposure levels. In humans Cd is mainly bound to metallothioneins (MT), which scavenge its toxic effects. Here we analyzed whether polymorphisms in MT genes MT1A and MT2A influence Cd-related kidney damage.
In a cross-sectional study N=512 volunteers were selected from three areas in South-Eastern China, which to varying degree were Cd-polluted from a smelter (control area [median Cd in urine U-Cd=2.67 μg/L], moderately [U-Cd=4.23 μg/L] and highly [U-Cd=9.13 μg/L] polluted areas). U-Cd and blood Cd (B-Cd) concentrations were measured by graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. MT1A rs11076161 (G/A), MT2A rs10636 (G/C) and MT2A rs28366003 (A/G) were determined by Taqman assays; urinary N-Acetyl-beta-(D)-Glucosaminidase (UNAG) by spectrometry, and urinary β2-microglobulin (UB2M) by ELISA.
Higher B-Cd (natural log-transformed) with increasing number of MT1A rs11076161 A-alleles was found in the highly polluted group (p-value trend=0.033; all p-values adjusted for age, sex, and smoking). In a linear model a significant interaction between rs11076161 genotype and B-Cd was found for UNAG (p=0.001) and UB2M concentrations (p=0.001). Carriers of the rs11076161 AA genotype showed steeper slopes for the associations between Cd in blood and natural log-transformed UB2M (β=1.2, 95% CI 0.72-1.6) compared to GG carriers (β=0.30, 95% CI 0.15-0.45). Also for UNAG (natural log-transformed) carriers of the AA genotype had steeper slopes (β=0.55, 95% CI 0.27-0.84) compared to GG carriers (β=0.018, 95% CI -0.79-0.11).
MT1A rs11076161 was associated with B-Cd concentrations and Cd-induced kidney toxicity at high exposure levels.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest human gene family, are important regulators of signaling pathways. However, knowledge of their genetic alterations is limited. In this study, we used exon capture and massively parallel sequencing methods to analyze the mutational status of 734 GPCRs in melanoma. This investigation revealed that one family member, GRM3, was frequently mutated and that one of its mutations clustered within one position. Biochemical analysis of GRM3 alterations revealed that mutant GRM3 selectively regulated the phosphorylation of MEK, leading to increased anchorage-independent growth and migration. Melanoma cells expressing mutant GRM3 had reduced cell growth and cellular migration after short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of GRM3 or treatment with a selective MEK inhibitor, AZD-6244, which is currently being used in phase 2 clinical trials. Our study yields the most comprehensive map of genetic alterations in the GPCR gene family.
The present study was designed to investigate the role of the central nervous system in the rebound hypertension precipitated by abrupt cessation of chronic clonidine (Cl) treatment. Male Wistar rats were treated with Cl (100 micrograms/kg, s.c.) twice daily for 7 days. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured at different time intervals during Cl treatment. Rebound hypertension occurred 16-18 h after the last injection of Cl, but not in control animals given saline (0.1 ml) twice a day for 7 days. Rats were anesthetized with ether during this rebound phase of Cl withdrawal, an electrode inserted into the posterior hypothalamus, and a cannula introduced into the lateral cerebral ventricle. The posterior hypothalamus was electrically stimulated, and voltage-response curves obtained for control and Cl-treated rats revealed that the pressor responsiveness to hypothalamic stimulation was significantly potentiated in the Cl-treated rats. In addition, the depressor response to a single injection of Cl (10 micrograms) into the lateral cerebral ventricle was significantly attenuated in the Cl-treated rats. Additional experiments were performed in pithed rats to determine the involvement of peripheral adrenergic mechanisms in the rebound hypertension. When rats were pithed during the hypertensive phase of withdrawal, the blood pressure of treated rats decreased to a level which was similar to that of control animals. While the pressor responses to total spinal stimulation were similar in both the groups, the effect of exogenous norepinephrine was significantly attenuated in Cl-treated rats., These results suggest that a hyperresponsiveness of central noradrenergic pressor pathways contributes to the rebound hypertension noted following the abrupt cessation of clonidine treatment.
In about 20 per cent of patients taking the antihypertensive agent methyldopa, IgG autoantibodies form against red cells, but most such patients do not have hemolysis. The reason for this is uncertain; it does not appear to be explained by known characteristics of the autoantibody. Since antibody-dependent reticuloendothelial function is an important determinant of cell clearance, we measured reticuloendothelial function in nine patients taking methyldopa. We did this by measuring the rate of clearance of radiolabeled autologous red cells sensitized with anti-D alloantibody. Five patients had a positive direct antiglobulin test, and four did not. Only one patient had laboratory evidence of hemolysis. The patients without hemolysis had significantly impaired reticuloendothelial clearance. In contrast, the patient with hemolysis did not have impaired reticuloendothelial function. This study suggests that in patients taking methyldopa who have a positive direct antiglobulin test the absence of hemolysis may be caused by an impairment in reticuloendothelial function. That the drug itself may be responsible for the impairment is suggested by the occurrence of abnormal reticuloendothelial function in patients taking the drug who have a negative direct antiglobulin test.
A 42 year old woman with foot process disease, was treated with corticosteroids for 6 years. She had been suffering, for about 3 years from progressive muscle weakness of the limbs, accompanied by general paresthesia, cramps of the calves and burning muscle pain both at rest and an effort. The clinical, neurophysiological and histochemical examination indicated noninflammatory myopathic damage. The progressive reduction of corticosteroid dosage led rapidly to a distinct improvement, but not to a remission, of symptoms. Clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with those observed in most cases of steroid myopathy described in literature. We discuss the possible pathogenetic role of corticosteroids in this affection.
To identify new risk variants for cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, we performed a genome-wide association study of 16 million SNPs identified through whole-genome sequencing of 457 Icelanders. We imputed genotypes for 41,675 Illumina SNP chip-typed Icelanders and their relatives. In the discovery phase, the strongest signal came from rs78378222[C] (odds ratio (OR) = 2.36, P = 5.2 × 10(-17)), which has a frequency of 0.0192 in the Icelandic population. We then confirmed this association in non-Icelandic samples (OR = 1.75, P = 0.0060; overall OR = 2.16, P = 2.2 × 10(-20)). rs78378222 is in the 3' untranslated region of TP53 and changes the AATAAA polyadenylation signal to AATACA, resulting in impaired 3'-end processing of TP53 mRNA. Investigation of other tumor types identified associations of this SNP with prostate cancer (OR = 1.44, P = 2.4 × 10(-6)), glioma (OR = 2.35, P = 1.0 × 10(-5)) and colorectal adenoma (OR = 1.39, P = 1.6 × 10(-4)). However, we observed no effect for breast cancer, a common Li-Fraumeni syndrome tumor (OR = 1.06, P = 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.27).
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an adrenal 17-ketosteroid, is a precursor of testosterone and 17beta-estradiol. Studies have shown that DHEA inhibits carcinogenesis in mammary gland and prostate as well as other organs, a process that is not hormone dependent. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of DHEA-mediated inhibition of the neoplastic process. Here we examine whether DHEA and its analog DHEA 8354 can suppress the progression of hyperplastic and premalignant (carcinoma in situ) lesions in mammary gland toward malignant tumors and the cellular mechanisms involved.
Rats were treated with N-nitroso-N-methylurea and allowed to develop mammary hyperplastic and premalignant lesions with a maximum frequency 6 weeks after carcinogen administration. The animals were then given DHEA or DHEA 8354 in the diet at 125 or 1,000 mg/kg diet for 6 weeks. The effect of these agents on induction of apoptosis, senescence, cell proliferation, tumor burden and various effectors of cellular signaling were determined.
Both agents induced a dose-dependent decrease in tumor multiplicity and in tumor burden. In addition they induced a senescent phenotype in tumor cells, inhibited cell proliferation and increased the number of apoptotic cells. The DHEA-induced cellular effects were associated with increased expression of p16 and p21, but not p53 expression, implicating a p53-independent mechanism in their action.
We provide evidence that DHEA and DHEA 8354 can suppress mammary carcinogenesis by altering various cellular functions, inducing cellular senescence, in tumor cells with the potential involvement of p16 and p21 in mediating these effects.
Maternal caffeine consumption is associated with reduced fetal growth, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Since there is evidence that decreased placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) is linked to fetal growth restriction, we hypothesized that caffeine may inhibit fetal growth partly through down regulating placental 11β-HSD2. As a first step in examining this hypothesis, we studied the effects of caffeine on placental 11β-HSD2 activity and expression using our established primary human trophoblast cells as an in vitro model system. Given that maternal serum concentrations of paraxanthine (the primary metabolite of caffeine) were greater in women who gave birth to small-for-gestational age infants than to appropriately grown infants, we also studied the effects of paraxanthine. Our main findings were: (1) both caffeine and paraxanthine decreased placental 11β-HSD2 activity, protein and mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner; (2) this inhibitory effect was mediated by the adenosine A(2B) receptor, since siRNA-mediated knockdown of this receptor prevented caffeine- and paraxanthine-induced inhibition of placental 11β-HSD2; and (3) forskolin (an activator of adenyl cyclase and a known stimulator of 11β-HSD2) abrogated the inhibitory effects of both caffeine and paraxanthine, which provides evidence for a functional link between exposure to caffeine and paraxanthine, decreased intracellular levels of cAMP and reduced placental 11β-HSD2. Taken together, these findings reveal that placental 11β-HSD2 is a novel molecular target through which caffeine may adversely affect fetal growth. They also uncover a previously unappreciated role for the adenosine A(2B) receptor signaling in regulating placental 11β-HSD2, and consequently fetal development.
Phthalates, ubiquitous environmental pollutants that may disturb the endocrine system, are used primarily as plasticizers of polyvinyl chloride and as additives in consumer and personal care products.
In this study, we examined the association between urinary concentrations of nine phthalate metabolites and breast cancer (BC) in Mexican women.
We age-matched 233 BC cases to 221 women residing in northern Mexico. Sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics were obtained by direct interviews. Phthalates were determined in urine samples (collected pretreatment from the cases) by isotope dilution/high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.
Phthalate metabolites were detected in at least 82% of women. The geometric mean concentrations of monoethyl phthalate (MEP) were higher in cases than in controls (169.58 vs. 106.78 microg/g creatinine). Controls showed significantly higher concentrations of mono-n-butyl phthalate, mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, and mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) than did the cases. After adjusting for risk factors and other phthalates, MEP urinary concentrations were positively associated with BC [odds ratio (OR), highest vs. lowest tertile = 2.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.33-3.63; p for trend < 0.01]. This association became stronger when estimated for premenopausal women (OR, highest vs. lowest tertile = 4.13; 95% CI, 1.60-10.70; p for trend < 0.01). In contrast, we observed significant negative associations for monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) and MCPP.
We show for the first time that exposure to diethyl phthalate, the parent compound of MEP, may be associated with increased risk of BC, whereas exposure to the parent phthalates of MBzP and MCPP might be negatively associated. These findings require confirmation.
Transgenic rat mutation assays can be used to assess genotoxic properties of chemicals in target organs for carcinogenicity. Mutations in transgenes are genetically neutral and accumulate during a treatment period; thus, assays are suitable for assessing the genotoxic risk of chemicals using a repeated-dose treatment paradigm. However, only a limited number of such studies have been conducted. To examine the utility of transgenic rat assays in repeated-dose studies, we fed male and female Sprague-Dawley gpt delta rats with a 0.5% phenacetin-containing diet for 26 and 52 weeks. A long-term feeding of phenacetin is known to induce renal cancer in rats. Phenacetin administration for 52 weeks in males significantly increased gpt (point mutations) mutant frequency (MF) in the kidney, the target organ of carcinogenesis. In the liver, the nontarget organ of carcinogenesis, gpt MFs were significantly elevated in phenacetin treatment groups of both genders during 26- and 52-week treatments. Furthermore, sensitive to P2 interference (Spi(-)deletions) MF increased in the liver of both genders following 52-week treatment. MFs were higher after treatment for 52 weeks than after treatment for 26 weeks. Frequencies of phenacetin-induced mutations were higher in the liver than in the kidney, suggesting that the intensity of genotoxicity does not necessarily correlate with the induction of tumor formation. Results from gpt delta rat assays of repeated-dose treatments are extremely useful to elucidate the relationship between gene mutations and carcinogenesis in the target organ induced by cancer-causing agents.
(-)-(1R,2R)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)-phenol hydrochloride (tapentadol HCl) is a novel micro-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist (Ki = 0.1 microM; relative efficacy compared with morphine 88% in a [35S]guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assay) and NE reuptake inhibitor (Ki = 0.5 microM for synaptosomal reuptake inhibition). In vivo intracerebral microdialysis showed that tapentadol, in contrast to morphine, produces large increases in extracellular levels of NE (+450% at 10 mg/kg i.p.). Tapentadol exhibited analgesic effects in a wide range of animal models of acute and chronic pain [hot plate, tail-flick, writhing, Randall-Selitto, mustard oil colitis, chronic constriction injury (CCI), and spinal nerve ligation (SNL)], with ED50 values ranging from 8.2 to 13 mg/kg after i.p. administration in rats. Despite a 50-fold lower binding affinity to MOR, the analgesic potency of tapentadol was only two to three times lower than that of morphine, suggesting that the dual mode of action of tapentadol may result in an opiate-sparing effect. A role of NE in the analgesic efficacy of tapentadol was directly demonstrated in the SNL model, where the analgesic effect of tapentadol was strongly reduced by the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine but only moderately attenuated by the MOR antagonist naloxone, whereas the opposite was seen for morphine. Tolerance development to the analgesic effect of tapentadol in the CCI model was twice as slow as that of morphine. It is suggested that the broad analgesic profile of tapentadol and its relative resistance to tolerance development may be due to a dual mode of action consisting of both MOR activation and NE reuptake inhibition.
Although paclitaxel (TAXOL) appears to be one of the most promising antineoplastic agents of the last decade, with demonstrated activity in advanced and refractory ovarian, breast, lung, and head and neck cancers, most clinical oncologists have had little experience with the agent. This is largely the result of the initially limited supply of paclitaxel and other obstacles encountered during early clinical development that restricted the drug's availability to a few investigational centers. Although a high incidence of major hypersensitivity reactions due to the Cremophor EL vehicle used in formulation disrupted and almost terminated the clinical development of paclitaxel, hypersensitivity reactions are no longer a serious problem consequent to the advent of effective premedication regimens and longer administration schemes. Instead, neutropenia is the principal toxicity of paclitaxel. At clinically relevant doses, absolute neutrophil count nadirs are severely depressed in most patients. The duration of severe neutropenia, however, is usually brief; treatment delays for unresolved hematologic toxicity are rare, and absolute neutrophil count nadirs are constant with repetitive dosing, suggesting that neutropenia is not cumulative. Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia has occurred in up to 29% of patients in phase II trials, and other cardiac disturbances, including atrioventricular conduction and bundle branch blocks, ventricular tachycardia, and possible ischemic manifestations, have been reported in approximately 3% of patients. Cardiac disturbances have primarily been noted in studies that used cardiac monitoring to more effectively detect and manage major hypersensitivity reactions. Although sinus bradycardia and conduction blocks appear to represent true toxicities, ventricular tachycardia and ischemic manifestations, which have largely been observed in patients with preexisting cardiac disease, may not be due to paclitaxel. In view of the lack of clinical significance of the cardiac effects and their infrequent occurrence, cardiac monitoring during paclitaxel is not recommended for patients without cardiac risk factors. However, until precise risk factors can be defined, patients with a significant antecedent cardiac history are generally not considered to be good candidates for paclitaxel therapy. Neurotoxicity, characterized principally by peripheral neurosensory manifestations, has generally been of mild to moderate severity, even in heavily pretreated patients at paclitaxel doses < or = 200 mg/m2. However, some patients have developed a severe sensory-motor polyneuropathy at higher doses of paclitaxel (given as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin). Patients with an antecedent peripheral neuropathy or coexisting medical illnesses associated with peripheral neuropathy (such as diabetes mellitus and substantial prior alcohol use) appear to be especially prone to developing peripheral neuropathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Long-term preoperative lamivudine therapy has been recommended for patients with positive HBV DNA to suppress HBV replication before liver transplantation. However, it is unclear whether preoperative lamivudine therapy is mandatory in HBV DNA positive patients to reliably prevent HBV recurrence or whether transplantation should be delayed to allow time for sufficient preoperative lamivudine therapy.
From January 2000 to January 2004, thirty-eight patients serum positive for HBV DNA who survived more than 3 months after transplantation and received postoperative combination prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin and lamivudine were enrolled.
Total 2-year recurrence rate was 8.7%. When these 38 patients were divided into two groups according to preoperative lamivudine therapy duration: group 1 (n = 11) 4 weeks or more and group 2 (n = 27) less than 4 weeks, recurrences were detected in 3 (27.2%) and 4 (14.8%) patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, i.e. a similar recurrence rate in both groups (p = 0.390). Moreover, in a subgroup of 20 patients who received preoperative lamivudine therapy for less than one week, only one (5%) experienced HBV recurrence.
Our findings indicate that postoperative combination prophylaxis is effective and that preoperative lamivudine therapy is unlikely to be obligatory despite a positive preoperative serum HBV DNA status.
The incidence of Leydig cell adenomas increases in CD rats fed for 2 years with the hepatic peroxisome proliferator, ammonium perfluorooctanoate (C8). Treatment with C8 increased the serum concentration of estradiol in 2-week gavage studies, and feeding studies at various time points up to 2 years, and was also accompanied by increases in liver weight and hepatic beta-oxidation activity. Since peroxisome proliferators induce both hepatic beta-oxidation and specific cytochrome P450 enzymes, C8 may also induce aromatase (cytochrome P450-19A1), the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase which converts androgens to estrogens. This hypothesis was investigated in the present study. Adult male CD rats were dosed daily by gavage for 14 days with 0, 0.2, 2, 20, or 40 mg C8/kg body wt. An additional group, the pair-fed control, was fed at a rate matched to the daily consumption by the 40 mg C8/kg group. Treatment with C8 produced a dose dependent decrease in body weight, and increases in absolute and relative liver weights, and in the protein yield of hepatic microsomes. These C8-induced changes were associated with a 2-fold increase in the serum concentration of estradiol and up to a 16-fold increase in total hepatic aromatase activity. A significant linear correlation was established between serum estradiol and total hepatic aromatase activity. The absolute weights and the aromatase activity of the testes were not affected by C8. Hepatic peroxisomal beta-oxidation activity and the microsomal concentration of total cytochrome P450 were also increased by C8. A comparison of estimated EC50 values suggested that these parameters may be less sensitive to induction by C8 than hepatic aromatase activity. Co-incubation of control liver microsomes with C8 in the aromatase assay for 2 hr dose dependently reduced the apparent aromatase activity. This inhibition of aromatase in vitro but increase in vivo was further investigated using cultured rat hepatocytes. Decreases in aromatase activity were found after up to 42 hr of treatment with C8, but the enzyme activity was increased almost 2-fold after 66 hr. The results of this study suggest that the increased serum concentration of estradiol produced by C8 in rats is at least partly due to a direct effect on the liver to increase synthesis of estradiol through induction of aromatase cytochrome P450 in the endoplasmic reticulum.
Orally administered Cd is predominantly distributed to the intestine, and the majority of this mucosal Cd is bound to metallothionein (MT). MT attenuates heavy metal-induced cytotoxicity by sequestering these metals and lowering their intracellular concentrations. In addition, MT acts as an extracellular transporter of orally administered Cd to the kidney. Because of its low molecular weight, the Cd-MT complex is freely filtered at the glomerulus, and the filtered Cd-MT is then incorporated into renal proximal tubular cells. Megalin, a multiligand endocytic receptor (also known as low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 or Lrp2), acts as the receptor for Cd-MT in a renal proximal tubular cell model. Here, we used the soluble form of 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (sRAP; also known as Lrpap1), a ligand of megalin, to inhibit megalin function, and then analyzed the effect of megalin loss on Cd-MT distribution and Cd-MT-induced nephrotoxicity in an animal model. Administration of sRAP to mice caused acute loss of megalin function by removing megalin in the brush border membrane. The pre-injection of sRAP decreased renal Cd content and decreased Cd-MT-induced kidney damage. Our results demonstrate that sRAP reduces Cd-MT-induced kidney toxicity in vivo.
Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephropathy, with antioxidants significantly reducing the proteinuria. The temporal relationship between lipid peroxidation in the kidney and proteinuria was examined in this study. Rats were treated with a single IV injection of puromycin aminonucleoside, (PAN, 7.5 mg/kg) and 24 hour urine samples were obtained prior to sacrifice on days 3,5,7,10,17,27,41 (N = 5-10 per group). The kidneys were removed, flushed with ice cold TRIS buffer. Kidney cortices from each animal were used to prepare homogenates. Tissue lipid peroxidation was measured in whole homogenates as well as in lipid extracts from homogenates as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Proteinuria was evident at day 5, peaked at day 7 and persisted to day 27. Lipid peroxidation in homogenates was maximal at day 3 and declined rapidly to control levels by day 17. This study supports the role of lipid peroxidation in mediating the proteinuric injury in PAN nephropathy.
Vasodilating agents acutely reduce regurgitant volume and improve left ventricular performance in aortic regurgitation, but more information is necessary about their long-term efficacy. To evaluate the effects of 12 months of therapy with nifedipine, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in 72 asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation. At 12 months, patients receiving nifedipine had a significant reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (110 +/- 19 versus 136 +/- 22 ml/m2, p less than 0.01) and mass (115 +/- 19 versus 142 +/- 16 g/m2, p less than 0.01) measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. They also had a reduction in left ventricular mean wall stress (360 +/- 27 versus 479 +/- 36 kdyne/cm2, p less than 0.001) and an increase in ejection fraction (72 +/- 8% versus 60 +/- 6%, p less than 0.05). These data show that the long-term unloading action of nifedipine is able to reverse left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy and suggest that such therapy has the potential to delay the need for valve replacement in asymptomatic patients.
The ultrastructural changes in the neural tube of 10-day-old mouse embryos were investigated between 1.5 hr and 4 hr after application of either 1 mg/kg colchicine (Col) or 500 mg/kg hydroxyurea (HU) or simultaneous application of both substances. During the investigated period, the shape of the nuclei of the neuroepithelial cells had changed from elongated to round after Col application. The chromatin in the nuclei was condensed and arranged in clusters. A breakdown of polysomes into ribosomes and an enlargement of the rough ER was observed in the cytoplasm. At the luminal surface, bleb-like cytoplasmic processes of the neuroepithelial cells containing monoribosomes protruded into the lumen. No cell necroses were visible in the neural tube after Col application. A condensation of chromatin in the nuclei of some neuroepithelial cells was visible 1.5 hr after HU application. Shortly thereafter, cell necroses appeared in the neural tube and 4 hr after HU application the entire spinal cord was strongly damaged. After simultaneous application of Col and HU, the ultrastructural changes in the neuroepithelial cells of the neural tube did not differ from the results obtained after Col application alone. In contrast to the results obtained after HU application alone, no necroses occurred after simultaneous application of Col and HU.
Acute administration of the antitumoral drug cisplatin can induce nausea/emesis and diarrhea. The long-term effects of cisplatin on gastrointestinal motility, particularly after repeated administration, are not well known. Because cisplatin is highly neurotoxic, myenteric neurons can be affected. Our aim was to study the prolonged effects of repeated cisplatin administration in a rat model, focusing on gastrointestinal motor function and myenteric neurons.
Rats received saline or cisplatin (1 or 3 mg kg(-1), i.p.) once weekly for 5 weeks. One week after treatment, both upper gastrointestinal transit and colonic activity were evaluated, and tissue samples from ileum, colon and rectum were processed for histological analysis. Intestinal transit was measured invasively (charcoal method). Colonic activity was determined electromyographically. The gut wall structure was evaluated in sections using conventional histology and immunohistochemistry. Whole-mount preparations from the distal colon were labeled for different markers, including nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) to determine relative proportions of myenteric neurons vs the total neuronal population labeled with HuC/D.
One week after repeated cisplatin exposure, the upper gastrointestinal transit rate and colonic activity were dose-dependently reduced. The number of NSE- or HuC/D-immunoreactive myenteric neurons per ganglion was decreased; the proportion of CGRP-immunoreactive neurons was decreased, whereas that of NOS-immunoreactive cells was increased.
Chronic cisplatin may induce an enteric neuropathy characterized by changes in myenteric neurons associated with marked gastrointestinal motor dysfunction.
The antihypertensive efficacy both of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and thiazide diuretics has been claimed to be influenced by plasma renin activity, which declines with age and is low in blacks. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group preliminary study, the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of the ACE inhibitor enalapril (20 mg day-1) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg day-1) were evaluated and compared for 4 weeks in 20 African patients with essential hypertension. The two groups had similar baseline clinical features and serum Na+ and K+ levels. Hydrochlorothiazide caused a significant and sustained fall in erect blood pressure with a reflex tachycardia. Enalapril exerted only a modest antihypertensive action, but significantly reduced erect heart rate. Direct comparison of hydrochlorothiazide- and enalapril-induced hypotension suggested a greater fall in subjects on the thiazide. The 95% confidence limits for the thiazide-enalapril difference in antihypertensive action at the end of the study was 39.5 to -7.5 mm Hg systolic and 22.0 to -6.6 mm Hg diastolic. The maximal blood pressure fall after hydrochlorothiazide was positively correlated with age (r = 0.50; p less than 0.05), whilst that of enalapril was inversely related age to (r = -0.57, p less than 0.05). The results are compatible with the notion that ACE inhibitor monotherapy may be less effective than thiazide diuretic treatment in African and black patients with essential hypertension. The findings also support the concept that age and racial factors may influence the response to antihypertensive treatment.
Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1a1 (Oatp1a1) is predominantly expressed in livers of mice and is thought to transport bile acids (BAs) from blood into liver. Because Oatp1a1 expression is markedly decreased in mice after bile duct ligation (BDL). We hypothesized that Oatp1a1-null mice would be protected against liver injury during BDL-induced cholestasis due largely to reduced hepatic uptake of BAs. To evaluate this hypothesis, BDL surgeries were performed in both male wild-type (WT) and Oatp1a1-null mice. At 24 h after BDL, Oatp1a1-null mice showed higher serum alanine aminotransferase levels and more severe liver injury than WT mice, and all Oatp1a1-null mice died within 4 days after BDL, whereas all WT mice survived. At 24 h after BDL, surprisingly Oatp1a1-null mice had higher total BA concentrations in livers than WT mice, suggesting that loss of Oatp1a1 did not prevent BA accumulation in the liver. In addition, secondary BAs dramatically increased in serum of Oatp1a1-null BDL mice but not in WT BDL mice. Oatp1a1-null BDL mice had similar basolateral BA uptake (Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and Oatp1b2) and BA-efflux (multidrug resistance-associated protein [Mrp]-3, Mrp4, and organic solute transporter α/β) transporters, as well as BA-synthetic enzyme (Cyp7a1) in livers as WT BDL mice. Hepatic expression of small heterodimer partner Cyp3a11, Cyp4a14, and Nqo1, which are target genes of farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, and NF-E2-related factor 2, respectively, were increased in WT BDL mice but not in Oatp1a1-null BDL mice. These results demonstrate that loss of Oatp1a1 function exacerbates cholestatic liver injury in mice and suggest that Oatp1a1 plays a unique role in liver adaptive responses to obstructive cholestasis.
We compared latanoprost monotherapy therapy with timolol/ dorzolamide in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma to evaluate the effects on intraocular pressure (IOP) and occurrence of adverse events. IOP and topical side effects were evaluated at the beginning, first, and third months. Mean IOP was decreased at the third month. The most common side effect was hyperemia (43.6%). We concluded that latanoprost reduces IOP better than fixed combination and its topical side effects are tolerable.
In this paper we describe a patient with bcr/abl positive acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) derived from acquired sideroblastic anemia secondary to ifosphamide treatment given for the preceding non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the lung. Cytogenetically, Philadelphia chromosome was not detected through the whole course in this patient, and multiple chromosomal abnormalities including 5q- and monosomy 7 were found at the stage of sideroblastic anemia. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed no bcr/abl fusion transcript at the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. The mRNA encoding the major bcr/abl fusion protein then appeared in the stage of sideroblastic anemia. Finally, the mRNA encoding both major and minor bcr/abl was detected in the stage of AUL transformation. MLL gene rearrangement was not found by RT-PCR analysis at any stage of the disorder. These results may be direct evidence for the induction of the bcr/abl fusion gene by treatment with an alkylating agent (ifosphamide).
