The main objective of this work was to study the role of the GABAergic system on the convulsions elicited by the organochlorine insecticide lindane. The concentration of lindane in rat brain at the onset of the first tonic convulsion was taken as the endpoint for the neurotoxic action of the insecticide administered by intravenous infusion. Pretreatment with the GABA agonists muscimol and progabide, the GABA uptake blocker SK&F 89976-A, the GABA transaminase inhibitor gamma-acetylenic GABA, and the GABA indirect agonist phenobarbital significantly increased the threshold concentration of lindane in brain required to induce convulsions. The GABA agonist THIP, the GABA competitive antagonist bicuculline, and the prodrug cetyl-GABA had no effect on the brain level of lindane required to induce seizures. The noncompetitive GABA antagonists, picrotoxinin and pentylenetetrazol, significantly decreased the brain concentration of lindane needed to elicit convulsions. The concentration of GABA in the brain of lindane-treated rats was only modified by the significant increase produced after gamma-acetylenic GABA pretreatment. These results show that the convulsions elicited by lindane can be facilitated by some GABA antagonists and antagonized by GABA mimetics, especially those that enhance GABA functionality. The present data are consistent with the proposed in vitro competition of lindane for the picrotoxinin binding site associated with the Cl- ionophore of the GABAA receptor, and suggest that lindane may also interact in vivo with this site.
The present study has been designed to investigate the protective role of taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), a sulfur containing conditionally essential amino acid, against cadmium-induced cardiac dysfunction in mice. Cadmium chloride (CdCl(2)) was used as the source of cadmium and it was administered orally at a dose of 4mg/kg body weight for 6 days. Cadmium exposure caused significant accumulation of the cadmium and iron in mice hearts tissue. Levels of serum specific markers related to cardiac impairments, e.g. total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride were altered due to cadmium toxicity. Reduction in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, namely, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) have been observed in cadmium exposed mice. Cadmium intoxication also decreased the cardiac glutathione (GSH) and total thiols contents and increased the levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), lipid peroxidation end products, protein carbonyl content and the extent of DNA fragmentation. Oral administration of taurine at a dose of 100mg/kg body weight for 5 days, however, prevented all the toxin-induced oxidative impairments mentioned above. "Ferric Reducing/Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assay" showed that taurine could protect the cardiac tissue by preventing cadmium-induced reduction of the intracellular antioxidant power. Histological examination of cardiac segments also supported the beneficial role of taurine against cadmium-induced damages in the murine hearts. Effect of a well established antioxidant, vitamin C has been included in the study as a positive control. Combining all, results suggest that taurine attenuates cadmium-induced impairment in mice hearts.
Lithium is widely used in the treatment of bipolar affective disorders, and teratogenic effects include cardiovascular abnormalities, notably Ebstein anomaly. The most common side effect in the patient taking lithium is polyuria, a form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. We report the case of a manic-depressive gravida on lithium therapy who developed polyhydramnios in her last trimester. Because lithium crosses the placenta, we postulate that, by a similar mechanism, lithium may cause fetal polyuria which results in polyhydramnios.
Analysis of global methylation in cells has revealed correlations between overall DNA methylation status and some biological states. Recent studies suggest that epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation could be responsible for neuroadaptations induced by addictive drugs. However, there is no investigation to determine global DNA methylation status following repeated exposure to addictive drugs. Using mice conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure, we measured global DNA methylation level in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) associated with drug rewarding effects. We found that cocaine-, but not morphine- or food-CPP training decreased global DNA methylation in the PFC. Chronic treatment with methionine, a methyl donor, for 25 consecutive days prior to and during CPP training inhibited the establishment of cocaine, but not morphine or food CPP. We also found that both mRNA and protein level of DNMT (DNA methytransferase) 3b in the PFC were downregulated following the establishment of cocaine CPP, and the downregulation could be reversed by repeated administration of methionine. Our study indicates a crucial role of global PFC DNA hypomethylation in the rewarding effects of cocaine. Reversal of global DNA hypomethylation could significantly attenuate the rewarding effects induced by cocaine. Our results suggest that methionine may have become a potential therapeutic target to treat cocaine addiction.
Current diagnostic techniques of prostate cancer cannot efficiently distinguish the latent and low-risk forms from the high-risk significant forms of prostate cancer. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), except other functions, plays an important role in cell transformation and the process of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, Cav-1 is involved in metastatic processes. It has also been shown that Cav-1 expression is induced under stress conditions, such as oxidative stress. The present study focused on the determination of prognostic markers of aggressive (high-grade) forms of prostate cancer. We determined serum Cav-1 and serum markers of antioxidant activity-glutathione (GSH), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), N,N-dimethyl-1,4-diaminobenzene (DMPD), free radicals method (FRK) and blue chromium peroxide (Cro) in 97 serum samples (82 prostate cancer patients and 15 controls). We found insignificant differences in Cav-1 between the sera of patients and controls (5.69 in the cancer group vs. 5.42 ng/ml in the control group). However, we found a significant (p<0.004) 2.8-fold elevation of Cav-1 in high tumour stages (TNM T4) compared to lower stages and a significant positive association with histological grading (r=0.29, p=0.028). We also found that in patients with high serum Cav-1 the antioxidant capacity of the body is reduced. These findings indicate that Cav-1 may be an interesting tool for the prediction of disease burden.
Anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin is widely used to prevent and treat stroke in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves. Because vitamin K is an essential factor for ggg-carboxylation of osteocalcin, vitamin K antagonists might cause bone loss. Although the association between warfarin use and bone metabolism is still controversial, several studies show that bone mineral density is decreased and fracture risk is increased with warfarin therapy. Meanwhile, attenuation of gap junctional communication (GJC) by warfarin is reported in rat liver epithelial cells. However, the effect of warfarin on osteoblasts, in which GJC is important for osteoblastic differentiation, remains unknown. Here we investigated whether warfarin has an inhibitory effect on osteoblastic differentiation using an osteoblastic cell line (C2C12). Warfarin and 18-α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA), which is known as a nontoxic reversible GJC inhibitor, had the same effect on osteoblastic differentiation. Warfarin and AGA inhibited the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)2-induced mRNA levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen I α1, osteocalcin (OC) and osterix, which are specific markers for osteoblastic differentiation, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the activities of OC- and ALP-luciferase reporters, which are induced by BMP2, and the transcriptional activity of Runx2 on OC and ALP promoters were inhibited by warfarin and AGA. The amount and activity of ALP induced by BMP2 were also decreased by warfarin and AGA. These results suggest that warfarin and AGA, a GJC inhibitor, have an inhibitory effect on osteoblastic differentiation.
A retrospective survey involving 25,693 persons was carried out in four provinces and the city of Shanghai, China between December 1981 until May 1982 to document relatively serious side effects of praziquantel used in a mass treatment programme for schistosomiasis japonica. Only 122 or 0.47% of those participating in the study had experienced relatively serious side reactions to the drug. Most had only one kind of side effects but two or more were recorded in a few patients. Neuropsychiatric reactions were seen in 39 persons (0.15%,) cardiovascular reactions in 37 (0.14%), hepatic changes in four (0.02%), dermatological reactions in 18 (0.07%) and delayed reactions resulting in fatigue and inability to work in 29 (0.11%). Praziquantel remains the drug of choice for the treatment of oriental schistosomiasis, it is highly effective and although side effects are minimal, caution should be taken in the treatment of chronic disease with heart failure, ascites, poor hepatic compensation and renal failure.
Ion channelopathy plays an important role in human epilepsy with a genetic cause and has been hypothesized to occur in epilepsy after acquired insults to the CNS as well. Acquired alterations of ion channel function occur after induction of status epilepticus (SE) in animal models of epilepsy, but it is unclear how they correlate with the onset of spontaneous seizures. We examined the properties of hyperpolarization-activated cation (HCN) channels in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in conjunction with video-EEG (VEEG) recordings to monitor the development of spontaneous seizures in the rat pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Our results showed that dendritic HCN channels were significantly downregulated at an acute time point 1 week postpilocarpine, with loss of channel expression and hyperpolarization of voltage-dependent activation. This downregulation progressively increased when epilepsy was established in the chronic period. Surprisingly, VEEG recordings during the acute period showed that a substantial fraction of animals were already experiencing recurrent seizures. Suppression of these seizures with phenobarbital reversed the change in the voltage dependence of I(h), the current produced by HCN channels, but did not affect the loss of HCN channel expression. These results suggest two mechanisms of HCN channel downregulation after SE, one dependent on and one independent of recurrent seizures. This early and progressive downregulation of dendritic HCN channel function increases neuronal excitability and may be associated with both the process of epileptogenesis and maintenance of the epileptic state.
The most common cause of cystic fibrosis is a mutation that deletes phenylalanine 508 in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The delta F508 protein is misprocessed and degraded rather than traveling to the apical membrane. We used a novel strategy to introduce the delta F508 mutation into the mouse CFTR gene. Affected epithelia from homozygous delta F508 mice lacked CFTR in the apical membrane and were Cl-impermeable. These abnormalities are the same as those observed in patients with delta F508 and suggest that these mice have the same cellular defect. 40% of homozygous delta F508 animals survived into adulthood and displayed several abnormalities found in human disease and in CFTR null mice. These animals should provide an excellent model to investigate pathogenesis and to examine therapies directed at correcting the delta F508 defect.
To evaluate the possible role of 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors in the anticonvulsant effect of swim stress, mice were pre-treated with agonists and antagonists of these receptors prior to exposure to stress and the intravenous infusion of picrotoxin. 8-OH-DPAT ((+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin) and WAY-100635 (a selective agonist and antagonist of 5-HT 1A receptors), DOI (1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane) and ketanserin (a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor agonist and antagonist) were used. Results demonstrated that 1 and 3 mg/kg of 8-OH-DPAT increased the doses of picrotoxin producing running/bouncing clonus, tonic hindlimb extension and death in stressed and unstressed mice, respectively. Pre-treatment with WAY (0.3 mg/kg) prevented the effect of 8-OH-DPAT (3 mg/kg). DOI (2.5 mg/kg) and ketanserin (1 mg/kg) failed to affect the seizure threshold for picrotoxin. The results show that stimulation of 5-HT 1A receptors exerts anticonvulsant actions in stressed and unstressed mice, while stimulation of 5-HT 2A/2C receptors does not interfere with the effect of stress on picrotoxin-induced convulsions.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially serious syndrome. Since there are some alternatives to treatment with heparin in patients who develop HIT, the decision as to which to use should be based on renal and hepatic function, drug availability and the available monitoring resources. We report a patient who received heparin for mechanical aortic valve replacement. Her clinical course was complicated by HIT, which was treated initially by danaparoid. The syndrome progressed with new thrombotic complications, and eventually was treated successfully by bivalirudin (Angiomax; Medison Pharma Ltd, Petach Tikva, Israel) for 9 days. We propose that treatment with bivalirudin for several days is a safe and effective alternative to heparin therapy in patients who develop HIT.
An experimental study on the pathogenesis of methotrexate (MTX)-related neurotoxicity including disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (DNL) was conducted in cats. MTX was administered to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of adult cats using either an intracisternal intermittent instillation (ICI) model or an intraventricular continuous instillation (IVC) model. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of CSF-flow disturbance with kaolin-induced hydrocephalus, and 60Co irradiation were morphologically examined in these models. None of the animals from either the ICI and IVC groups showed DNL, but all animals showed segmental axonal degeneration, suggesting that MTX had a direct toxic effect on the axon. In the ICI groups, no apparent synergistic effect of CSF-flow disturbance and radiation was noted on this axonal change. In the IVC groups, CSF-flow disturbance augmented the degree of the axonal injury. Axonal degeneration and fibrin exudation in the walls of small blood vessels occurred in one animal of the IVC groups with CSF-flow disturbance, suggesting that a toxic effect of MTX on blood vessels is another mechanism of MTX-induced neurotoxicity.
Systemic ketosis was induced in first-parity gilts by the isocaloric substitution of glucose with 1,3-butylene glycol to supply 20% of the total dietary energy beginning on d 23 (23 BG) or d 60 (60 BG) of gestation. Ketosis reduced (P less than .05) maternal plasma glucose, urea N and insulin concentrations. Fetal carcass dry matter and carcass glycogen contents were reduced (P less than .05) by maternal ketogenic calorie substitution, whereas fetal hepatic glycogen and lipid contents were not influenced by maternal treatment. Neural acetate oxidation was reduced (P less than .05) in the 23 BG and 60 BG fetuses, with a concurrent increase (P less than .05) in beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) oxidation. Neural lipogenesis measured from acetate and BOHB substrates was nominal in the d 105 pig fetus. Fetal hepatic acetate and BOHB utilization for lipogenesis were increased (P less than .05) by maternal ketosis. Reproductive performance characteristics (litter size, number stillborn and birth weight) were not improved by maternal ketosis. The substantial improvement in lactation weight gain by litters from 23 BG and 60 BG dams (20%, P less than .05) may suggest a carryover effect of gestation dietary treatment on lactation performance.
Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy is a widely studied model of glomerular sclerosis (GS) in the rat, and cholesterol feeding exacerbates the injury induced by PAN. The importance of the interaction of angiotensin II (Ang II) with the AT2 receptor is unclear. We investigated the role of the renin-angiotensin system, particularly with regard to AT1 and AT2 receptor dynamics, in PAN and cholesterol-mediated GS.
Sprague-Dawley rats were given a 4% cholesterol diet (group II), subcutaneous PAN (group III), or a 4% cholesterol diet and PAN (group IV) and compared with a control group given PAN vehicle (group I). After 16 weeks, kidneys were harvested and tissue Ang II concentration, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and ACE, AT1, and AT2 mRNA levels were determined.
Compared with control rats, proteinuria was significantly higher in groups II to IV. Kidney ACE activity and ACE mRNA levels in groups III and IV were 2- and 3-fold higher than in groups I and II, respectively. Kidney Ang II concentration also was increased in the experimental groups. Whereas kidney AT1 mRNA was significantly lower in groups III and IV, kidney AT2 mRNA was significantly increased in groups II to IV.
In these experimental models of GS, there is significant activation of the tissue-based renin-angiotensin system. Puromycin with and without cholesterol decreased the AT1 receptor mRNA and increased the AT2 receptor mRNA. Up-regulation of AT2 receptors may be important in ameliorating the proliferative effects of Ang II, which presumably occur through the AT1 receptor.
We report a case of ticlopidine-induced prolonged cholestasis in a 60-year-old man with no previous hepatobiliary disease who presented with sudden right upper abdominal pain, jaundice and pruritus three months after starting ticlopidine therapy. Other drugs taken by the patient were not considered probable causes. The diagnostic evaluation showed no biliary obstruction and other possible causes of intra-hepatic cholestasis were excluded. The liver biopsy showed a cholestatic hepatitis with bile duct damage. The disease ran a severe and protracted course, but symptoms and jaundice eventually subsided five months after drug withdrawal. More than a year later, relevant abnormalities of liver function tests consistent with anicteric cholestasis still persist, fulfilling criteria for a minor form of drug-induced prolonged cholestasis. This syndrome has been reported infrequently in relation to several drugs, mainly chlorpromazine, and only once with ticlopidine.
Cardiac toxicity due to anthracycline therapy is dose related, and congestive failure is a major limiting factor to therapy. Radionuclide cardiac evaluation provides a sensitive noninvasive method for detecting changes in cardiac function. Fifteen patients receiving either doxorubicin or daunomycin were evaluated with radionuclide ejection fractions (EFrn). The data indicate that the EFrn can detect an acute depressant cardiac action of these drugs as early as 24 hr after drug administration. In addition, a cumulative or chronic cardiac depression was noted; cumulative dosage of doxorubicin or daunomycin correlated with a reduced EFrn (p less than 0.001). We conclude that (1) the EFrn can noninvasively detect significant changes in cardiac function at low cumulative doses of doxorubicin or daunomycin and (2) the EFrn may be useful in evaluating cardiac function in patients during doxorubicin or daunomycin therapy.
Effectiveness of antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs has already been demonstrated for migraine prophylaxis as monotherapy. In the present study, the efficacy and tolerability of amitriptyline and topiramate combination is examined in the prevention of migraine attacks, in comparison to the monotherapy of each drug.
A total of 73 patients with migraine headache with or without aura are included in this single-center, double-blind, randomized, and controlled trial. Patients were assigned to receive topiramate alone, amitriptyline alone or a combination of these drugs. Frequency, duration and severity of migraine attacks, accompanied symptoms, depressive state, consumption of medications, side effects and patient satisfaction were evaluated.
All treatments resulted in significant improvements in all efficacy measures (p<0.001 for all comparisons). However, patients receiving combination treatment had higher patient satisfaction compared with other groups both at 8 and 12 weeks (p=0.006 and p<0.001, respectively). Patients receiving amitriptyline and combination treatments had better depression scores compared with the topiramate group. Combination group had fewer side effects with a less amount of amitriptyline consumption.
Amitriptyline and topiramate combination may be beneficial for patients with migraine and comorbid depression, particularly in terms of side effects and associated displeasure due to monotherapy.
Two patients with classical rheumatoid arthritis developed myopathy during treatment with penicillamine. In both patients, electromyography and muscle biopsies were indicative of polymyositis. In one patient, muscle enzymes were not examined at the appropriate time; in the other patient muscle enzymes were raised. This latter patient also had a rash and, in the dermal epidermal junction of pathological skin, granular deposits of immunoglobulin and complement were found. The myopathy subsided in both patients after withdrawal of penicillamine.
Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is a key enzyme in transmethylation, transsulfuration, and the biosynthesis of polyamines. Genetic deficiency of alpha/beta-MAT causes isolated persistent hypermethioninemia and, in some cases, unusual breath odor or neural demyelination. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this deficiency has not been clearly defined. In this study, we characterized the human alpha/beta-MAT transcription unit and identified several mutations in the gene of patients with enzymatically confirmed diagnosis of MAT deficiency. Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assays demonstrated that these mutations partially inactivate MAT activity. These results establish the molecular basis of this disorder and allow for the development of DNA-based methodologies to investigate and diagnose hypermethioninemic individuals suspected of having abnormalities at this locus.
Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3), a plasma antioxidant enzyme, maintains genomic integrity by inactivating reactive oxygen species (ROS), known DNA-damaging agents and mediators of cancer chemotherapy response. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of GPx3 expression by promoter hypermethylation is frequently observed in a wide spectrum of human malignancies. Furthermore, GPx3 methylation correlates with head and neck cancer (HNC) chemoresistance and may serve as a potential prognostic indicator for HNC patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Our findings support the hypothesis that defects in the antioxidant system may contribute to tumorigenesis of a wide spectrum of human malignancies. GPx3 methylation may have implications in chemotherapy response and clinical outcome of HNC patients.
Physostigmine has been proposed as an antidote for gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) intoxication, based on associated awakenings in 1) patients anesthetized with GHB and 2) five of six patients administered physostigmine for GHB intoxication. However, there are neither well-supported mechanisms for physostigmine reversal of GHB effects, supportive animal studies, nor randomized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrating safety, efficacy, or improved outcomes. We sought to determine the outcomes of patients with GHB-induced coma after a physostigmine treatment protocol was instituted in an urban Emergency Department and ambulance service. Our search of medical records located five cases of GHB toxicity, all with co-intoxicants, who received physostigmine. None demonstrated response and, further, there were associated adverse events, including atrial fibrillation (2), pulmonary infiltrates (1) and significant bradycardia (1), and hypotension (1). We also reviewed 18 published GHB toxicity case series for incidence of adverse effects, stimulant co-intoxicants (which may heighten risk of physostigmine), complications, and outcomes of supportive care for GHB toxicity. We conclude that physostigmine is not indicated for reversal of GHB-induced alteration of consciousness; it is not efficacious, it may be unsafe, particularly in the setting of recreational polydrug use; and supportive care results in universally good outcomes.
A vaginal clear-cell adenocarcinoma developed in a young woman who had been exposed in utero to maternal stilboestrol treatment. During 1940-71 in the UK some 7500 women were given stilboestrol during pregnancy. Thus more cases are likely to appear and clinicians caring for young women should be alert to this possibility.
The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of simvastatin treatment starting 1 day after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rat and to investigate the underlying mechanism. Spinal cord injury was induced in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats after laminectomy at T9-T10. Then additionally with sham group (laminectomy only) the SCI animals were randomly divided into 3 groups: vehicle-treated group; 5-mg/kg simvastatin-treated group; and 10-mg/kg simvastatin-treated group. Simvastatin or vehicle was administered orally at 1 day after SCI and then daily for 5 weeks. Locomotor functional recovery was assessed during 8 weeks postoperation by performing open-field locomotor test and inclined-plane test. At the end of study, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were assessed to evaluate the integrity of spinal cord pathways. Then, the animals were killed, and 1-cm segments of spinal cord encompassing the injury site were removed for histopathological analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to observe the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the spinal cord. Results show that the simvastatin-treated animals showed significantly better locomotor function recovery, better electrophysiological outcome, less myelin loss, and higher expression of BDNF and GDNF. These findings suggest that simvastatin treatment starting 1 day after SCI can significantly improve locomotor recovery, and this neuroprotective effect may be related to the upregulation of BDNF and GDNF. Therefore, simvastatin may be useful as a promising therapeutic agent for SCI.
Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity is a serious side-effect, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We examined phospholipidosis and apoptosis in rat alveolar epithelial cells after medium-term oral amiodarone treatment. Amiodarone (30 mg/kg daily, a dosage corresponding to that used clinically) or vehicle was administered by gavage in 33 Wistar rats for two weeks. Apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) and the expression of apoptosis- and phospholipidosis-related proteins was measured by immunohistochemistry. Amiodarone decreased phospholipase-C-γ1 and increased phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate, resulting in phospholipidosis, evidenced by the appearance of intracellular inclusion bodies with a multi-lamellated interior. Amiodarone exerted two opposite effects on apoptosis; compared to controls, the expression of activated-caspase-8 was higher in treated rats, while the expression of apoptosis inhibitors survivin, Bcl-2 and c-Flip was lower. On the other hand, the expression of activated-caspase-3 was lower after treatment. Overall, amiodarone attenuated apoptosis, evidenced by fewer TUNEL-positive cells. Medium-term oral amiodarone administration induced phospholipidosis in rat alveolar epithelial cells. Although such treatment decreased anti-apoptotic proteins, apoptosis was attenuated via a decrease in the caspase-3 pathway. These findings improve current understanding on the mechanisms underlying amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity.
