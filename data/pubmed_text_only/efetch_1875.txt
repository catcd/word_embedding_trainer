In familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), the efficacy of the inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase shows considerable interindividual variation, and several genetic and environmental factors can contribute to explaining this variability. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was conducted in 63 children and adolescents with heterozygous FH. The patients were grouped according to known LDL receptor genotype. After 6 weeks of treatment with 20 mg/d simvastatin, the mean reduction in plasma LDL cholesterol in patients with the W66G mutation (n=14) was 31%, whereas in the deletion>15 kb (n=23) and the C646Y mutation groups (n=10), it was 38% and 42%, respectively (P<0.05). After treatment with simvastatin, HDL cholesterol levels were increased in all groups, and triglyceride concentrations were significantly reduced. Multiple regression analyses suggested that 42% of the variation of the LDL cholesterol response to simvastatin can be attributed to variation in the mutant LDL receptor locus, apolipoprotein E genotype, and body mass index, while 35% of the variation in HDL cholesterol response was explained by sex and baseline HDL cholesterol. These results show that simvastatin was an effective and well-tolerated therapy for FH in the pediatric population for all LDL receptor gene mutations. Moreover, the nature of LDL receptor gene mutations and other genetic and constitutional factors play a significant role in predicting the efficacy of simvastatin in the treatment of FH in children and adolescents.
In order to clarify the mechanisms by which the class Ib antiarrhythmic drug aprindine shows efficacy against atrial fibrillation (AF), we examined the effects of the drug on the repolarizing K+ currents in guinea-pig atrial cells by use of patch-clamp techniques. We also evaluated the effects of aprindine on experimental AF in isolated guinea-pig hearts. Aprindine (3 microM) inhibited the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) with little influence on the inward rectifier K+ current (IK1) or the Ca2+ current. Electrophysiological analyses including the envelope of tails test revealed that aprindine preferentially inhibits IKr (rapidly activating component) but not IKs (slowly activating component). The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-operated K+ current (IK.ACh) was activated by the extracellular application of carbachol (1 microM) or by the intracellular loading of GTPgammaS. Aprindine inhibited the carbachol- and GTPgammaS-induced IK.ACh with the IC50 values of 0.4 and 2.5 microM, respectively. In atrial cells stimulated at 0.2 Hz, aprindine (3 microM) per se prolonged the action potential duration (APD) by 50+/-4%. The drug also reversed the carbachol-induced action potential shortening in a concentration-dependent manner. In isolated hearts, perfusion of carbachol (1 microM) shortened monophasic action potential (MAP) and effective refractory period (ERP), and lowered atrial fibrillation threshold. Addition of aprindine (3 microM) inhibited the induction of AF by prolonging MAP and ERP. We conclude the efficacy of aprindine against AF may be at least in part explained by its inhibitory effects on IKr and IK.ACh.
Long-term therapy with lithium may be associated with a broad spectrum of functional and structural side-effects in the kidney. Among these features, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is the most frequent and it can be expected to occur in 20-70% of the patients. Diabetes insipidus is the result of a lithium induced resistance of collecting ducts to antidiuretic hormone. Additional functional disturbances are represented by renal tubular acidosis and consequences of hypercalcemia. Structural alterations of the kidney have a rare occurrence. In the literature, there are accounts of chronic tubulo-interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis and few cases of glomerulopathies. Our report of a patient with chronic interstital nephritis is supplemented by a brief discussion of the diverse picture of the nephrotoxicity of lithium.
Compelling evidence from both human and animal studies suggests a physiological link between the circadian rhythm and metabolism but the underlying mechanism is still incompletely understood. We examined the role of PPARγ, a key regulator of energy metabolism, in the control of physiological and behavioral rhythms by analyzing two strains of whole-body PPARγ null mouse models. Systemic inactivation of PPARγ was generated constitutively by using Mox2-Cre mice (MoxCre/flox) or inducibly by using the tamoxifen system (EsrCre/flox/TM). Circadian variations in oxygen consumption, CO(2) production, food and water intake, locomotor activity, and cardiovascular parameters were all remarkably suppressed in MoxCre/flox mice. A similar phenotype was observed in EsrCre/flox/TM mice, accompanied by impaired rhythmicity of the canonical clock genes in adipose tissues and liver but not skeletal muscles or the kidney. PPARγ inactivation in isolated preadipocytes following exposure to tamoxifen led to a similar blockade of the rhythmicity of the clock gene expression. Together, these results support an essential role of PPARγ in the coordinated control of circadian clocks and metabolic pathways.
Sulfur mustard (HD) is an alkylating and cytotoxic chemical warfare agent, which inflicts severe skin toxicity and an inflammatory response. Effective medical countermeasures against HD-caused skin toxicity are lacking due to limited knowledge of related mechanisms, which is mainly attributed to the requirement of more applicable and efficient animal skin toxicity models. Using a less toxic analog of HD, chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), we identified quantifiable inflammatory biomarkers of CEES-induced skin injury in dose- (0.05-2 mg) and time- (3-168 h) response experiments, and developed a CEES-induced skin toxicity SKH-1 hairless mouse model. Topical CEES treatment at high doses caused a significant dose-dependent increase in skin bi-fold thickness indicating edema. Histopathological evaluation of CEES-treated skin sections revealed increases in epidermal and dermal thickness, number of pyknotic basal keratinocytes, dermal capillaries, neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and desquamation of epidermis. CEES-induced dose-dependent increases in epidermal cell apoptosis and basal cell proliferation were demonstrated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (tdt)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling and proliferative cell nuclear antigen stainings, respectively. Following an increase in the mast cells, myeloperoxidase activity in the inflamed skin peaked at 24 h after CEES exposure coinciding with neutrophil infiltration. F4/80 staining of skin integuments revealed an increase in the number of macrophages after 24 h of CEES exposure. In conclusion, these results establish CEES-induced quantifiable inflammatory biomarkers in a more applicable and efficient SKH-1 hairless mouse model, which could be valuable for agent efficacy studies to develop potential prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for HD-induced skin toxicity.
The effects of nitric acid (NO) on vessel response to injury include the inhibition of platelet adhesion, platelet aggregation, leukocyte adhesion and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Releasing NO from a stent might reduce the clinical problem of restenosis. The present study was designed to examine whether an NO-eluting covered stent can prevent neointimal formation in a porcine carotid overstretch injury model.
The interior of a self-expanding polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered aSpire stent was coated with silicone, which contained 23.6 microg or 54.5 microg sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO-releasing compound). The stent was implanted into carotid artery. Six pigs were implanted with stents, one high-dose SNP and one uncoated control, following balloon overstretch injury of the carotid artery with a balloon-to-artery ratio of 1.3:1.
No local or systemic toxicity was evidenced in the six pigs after carotid artery implantation with either low- or high-dose stents within a week. At day 28, the mean intimal thickness was 0.12 +/- 0.05 mm for NO-eluting stents and 0.43 +/- 0.09 mm for uncoated stents (p = 0.008). The mean neointimal area was reduced from 2.40 +/- 0.39 mm2 for control stents to 0.49 +/- 0.16 mm2 for NO-eluting stents (p < 0.0001), which resulted in a 24% reduction of angiographic vessel narrowing.
The NO-eluting ePTFE-covered stent is feasible and effectively reduces in-stent neointimal hyperplasia at 28 days in a porcine carotid overstretch model.
In mammals, sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus occurs during prenatal and early postnatal development due in large part to sex differences in hormones. These early organizational processes are critically important for the attainment and maintenance of adult reproductive functions. We tested the hypothesis that perinatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that disrupt hormonal pathways would perturb reproductive maturation and the sexually dimorphic development of neuroendocrine systems in the preoptic area (POA). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected on gestational d 16 and 18 with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide), Aroclor 1221 (A1221, an estrogenic PCB mix), a reconstituted PCB mixture representing those highest in human body burden (PCBs 138, 153, 180), or estradiol benzoate, an estrogenic control. Male and female pups were monitored for somatic and reproductive development. In adulthood, some rats were perfused and used for immunohistochemistry of estrogen receptor α, kisspeptin, and coexpression of Fos in GnRH neurons. Other rats were used to obtain fresh-frozen POA dissections for use in a PCR-based 48-gene expression array. Pubertal onset was advanced and estrous cyclicity irregular in endocrine-disrupted females. Furthermore, sexual differentiation of female neuroendocrine systems was masculinized/defeminized. Specifically, in the adult female anteroventral periventricular nucleus, estrogen receptor α-cell numbers and kisspeptin fiber density were significantly decreased, as was GnRH-Fos coexpression. PCR analysis identified androgen receptor, IGF-I, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit NR2b, and TGFβ1 mRNAs as significantly down-regulated in endocrine-disrupted female POAs. These data suggest that developmental PCBs profoundly impair the sexual differentiation of the female hypothalamus.
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) activators that exhibit antihypertensive and vasculo-protective effects. Here we describe the use of Tie2Cre/flox and SM22Cre/flox mice, which respectively lacked PPARgamma in the endothelium and the smooth muscle, to study vascular function of PPARgamma. Rosiglitazone (RGZ) induced a similar blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) salt-treated PPARgamma(f/f) and SM22Cre/flox mice, whereas Tie2Cre/flox mice were completely resistant to this effect. The femoral arteries lacking endothelial PPARgamma exhibited increased reactivity to various vasoconstrictors without a significant alteration in acetylcholine-induced relaxation. In sharp contrast, the vasculature lacking smooth muscle PPARgamma had blunted sensitivity to alpha1-adrenergic agents but enhanced sensitivity to acetylcholine. Our results demonstrated endothelium but not smooth muscle as the site for TZD-induced BP-lowering effect and also uncovered distinct functions of endothelial and smooth muscle PPARgamma in regulation of vascular tone.
Until now the relation between advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and vascular lesion is still controversial. However, the interaction of the former with a receptor triggers the synthesis of cytokines particularly interleukin 1- beta(IL-1 beta) and tumour necrosis factor- alpha(TNFalpha ). Subsequent release of nitric oxide (NO) may in turn induce certain damage to beta cell islets. Several arguments indicated that AGEs and reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) could alter the function of the vessel wall. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of aminoguanidine, AG (inhibitor of AGE formation) joined with omega -3-fatty acids, omega 3FAs (anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive drug) in STZ diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in 48 female albino Wistar rats by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg kg (-1)). Diabetic animals were treated with AG (50 mg kg(-1) ) and/or omega 3FAs (12 mg kg (-1)) daily and orally for 4 weeks. Groups of age matched diabetic rats ( n= 10) and healthy animals ( n= 10) served as positive and negative controls. At the end of the study, plasma glucose, fructosamine, total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), the susceptibility of LDL to copper-catalysed oxidation, catalase activity, NO, IL-1 beta, TNF alpha were measured. Histopathological assessment of pancreatic slices were also determined. Diabetes remarkably increased plasma glucose, fructosamine and dyslipidaemia (increased TC, LDLC and decreased HDLC). Oxidative markers like oxidative susceptibility of LDL, catalase activity and NO levels were greatly enhanced. Finally, it increased the synthesis and release of cytokine (IL-1beta and TNF alpha). Treatment of diabetic rats with AG and omega 3FAs markedly reduced the above mentioned parameters. Combined form therapy has a better effect regarding oxidative cell markers, specifically NO level. Finally, omega 3FAs coadministration with AG nearly restored the atrophy of islets of Langerhan's and the peripheral lymphocytic infiltration compared to diabetic and AG treated groups. In conclusion, there is a direct correlation between glycation, oxidative stress and cytokine production with increased propensity of microvascular disorder in STZ diabetic rats. omega 3FA administration with AGE receptor blocker may represent a possible avenue of research for therapeutics directed for alleviating the complication associated with diabetes.
We report a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of bronchus who developed the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) after receiving cisplatinum (CDDP) and vindesine (VDS). The 75-year-old man developed right chest pain and was found to have a squamous cell carcinoma of bronchus (stage IIIA, T3N1M0). He was treated by CDDP and VDS. The serum sodium concentration decreased from 136 mEq/l to 120 mEq/l after drug administration. SIADH was diagnosed on the basis of hyponatremia with corresponding serum hypoosmolality and an inappropriately high urinary osmolality due to continued sodium excretion. In our case, SI-ADH was probably induced by CDDP or VDS. Fluid restriction and sodium supplement resulted in a progressive rise in the serum sodium level to 134 mEq/l in 4 days.
Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains chronic in 75% of infected individuals, in whom it can cause liver inflammation and progressive fibrosis leading to cirrhosis in 20% of patients. A sustained viral response (SVR) to HCV therapy, i.e. undetectable plasma HCV RNA 6 months after the end of treatment, leads to permanent eradication of the virus in 98.3% of patients. The current treatment of choice is combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa (PEG-IFN alfa), 2a or 2b, and ribavirin (RBV), which achieves an SVR in 54-56% of patients. In patients with HCV genotype 1, RBV doses of 1000-1200 mg/day are associated with a higher SVR than 800 mg/day (51 vs 40%). However, RBV also causes dose-dependent reversible haemolytic anaemia that, in combination with the myelosuppressive effects of PEG-IFN, results in a mean drop in haemoglobin (Hb) level of 3.7 g/dL within 4 weeks. Conventionally, this acute anaemia has been managed with RBV dose reductions. However, this may result in a decreased SVR rate. Alternatively, this anaemia can be managed with administration of epoetin alfa at 40 000 IU once weekly. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, treatment with epoetin alfa has been shown to raise Hb levels and maintain RBV doses. Furthermore, the increase in Hb level was associated with improved quality of life. Anaemia in patients treated with interferon plus RBV combination therapy can be managed effectively and safely with once weekly epoetin alfa without sacrificing optimal dosing of RBV.
Durable complete response rates ranging from 5% to 20% have been reported in association with biochemotherapy for patients with metastatic melanoma, with response rates on the low end of this range being observed in trials that used lower doses and less intense treatment schedules. In the current study, the authors addressed the feasibility of increasing the doses of agents used in concurrent biochemotherapy.
Three patients with metastatic melanoma were enrolled at each of six concurrent biochemotherapy dose levels. The doses were as follows: dacarbazine 800 mg/m(2) or 1000 mg/m(2) (Day 1); cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) or 30 mg/m(2) (Days 1-4); vinblastine 1.6 mg/m(2) or 1.8 mg/m(2) (Days 1-5); interleukin-2 9 million units (MU) per m(2) or 12 MU/m(2) as a 24-hour continuous infusion (Days 1-4); and interferon-alpha-2b 5 MU/m(2), 10 MU/m(2), or 15 MU/m(2) (Days 1-5) and 5 MU/m(2) (Days 7, 9, and 11) administered subcutaneously.
Of the 19 patients who were enrolled, 18 were evaluable for toxicity and response. Sixty-nine treatment courses were administered in total (median, 4 courses per patient; range, 1-6 courses per patient), with reduction of the dose of at least 1 agent being required in 7 courses (10%). Twenty-six courses were delayed by a median of 7 days (range, 3-29 days), with interferon-alpha-2b administration frequently omitted because of thrombocytopenia, most often after Day 5. Blood product support was required in 40 courses. Dose-limiting toxic effects included global encephalopathy, renal and hepatic dysfunction, pancreatitis, and ileus. There was 1 complete response, and there were 10 partial responses. The median time to disease progression was 6.9 months, and the median survival duration was 12.2 months.
Although dose intensification can be achieved safely in patients with advanced melanoma, other strategies should be pursued to enhance the clinical activity of biochemotherapy as a response induction regimen.
Dipyridamole, developed almost half a century ago, acts by inhibiting nucleoside transport, which increases adenosine levels leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilatation mainly in the coronary tree. It is a vaso-protective drug with proven efficacy in the prevention of strokes. Adenosine receptor 2 inhibitory purines, ubiquitously available in food and drink, inhibit the vasomotor effects of dipyridamole but not its action on platelet aggregation. This and the slow build-up of blood levels of dipyridamole after oral application may explain why incidents of drug-induced angina ("coronary steal") were never reported in the prevention trials. The prevention of arterial thrombosis and the positive remodeling of the arterial system (arteriogenesis) by elevated blood flows suggest that dipyridamole may be able to halt the progression of organ manifestations of atherosclerosis. Clinical trials for the secondary prevention of vascular occlusions in other vascular beds should be encouraged.
The effectiveness of combined chemoimmunotherapy with ifosfamide derivative CBM-4A and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was investigated in two experimental tumor models, 3MC-induced MHC class I+ sarcoma Mc12 and HPV16 E6/E7 oncogene-induced MHC class I- carcinoma MK16, transplanted in syngeneic mice. Treatment of Mc12 and MK16 tumor-bearing mice with GM-CSF or CBM-4A alone produced moderate anti-tumor effects. However, when the tumor-bearing mice were first treated i.p. with a single dose of CBM-4A (150 mg/kg) and three days later peritumorally with five daily doses of GM-CSF (100 ng/day), substantially stronger tumor-inhibitory effects were observed. The results indicate that in both, MHC class I+ and MHC class I- tumors, the combined chemoimmunotherapy can inhibit tumor progression more effectively than GM-CSF therapy or chemotherapy alone, and they suggest that GM-CSF should be considered as adjuvant to chemotherapy in clinical trials with HPV 16-associated neoplasms.
The present study has been designed to investigate the effect of benfotiamine, a thiamine derivative, in sodium arsenite-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) in rats. Sodium arsenite (1.5 mg(-1) kg(-1) day(-1) i.p., 2 weeks) was administered in rats to produce VED. The development of VED was assessed by employing isolated aortic ring preparation and estimating the serum and aortic concentrations of nitrite/nitrate. Further, the integrity of vascular endothelium in thoracic aorta was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, the oxidative stress was assessed by estimating serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and aortic superoxide anion generation. The administration of sodium arsenite markedly produced VED by attenuating acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, decreasing serum and aortic concentrations of nitrite/nitrate, and impairing the integrity of vascular endothelium. Further, sodium arsenite produced oxidative stress by increasing serum TBARS and aortic superoxide generation. The treatment with benfotiamine (25, 50, and 100 mg(-1) kg(-1) day(-1) p.o.) or atorvastatin (30 mg(-1) kg(-1) day(-1) p.o., a standard agent) prevented sodium arsenite-induced VED and oxidative stress. However, the beneficial effects of benfotiamine in preventing the sodium arsenite-induced VED were attenuated by co-administration with N-omega-nitro-L: -arginine methyl ester (L: -NAME) (25 mg(-1) kg(-1) day(-1), i.p.), an inhibitor of NOS. Thus, it may be concluded that benfotiamine reduces oxidative stress and activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase to enhance the generation and bioavailability of NO and subsequently improves the integrity of vascular endothelium to prevent sodium arsenite-induced experimental VED.
p53 is the most frequently mutated tumour-suppressor gene in human cancers. Mutant p53 is thought to contribute to carcinogenesis by the acquisition of gain-of-function properties or through the exertion of dominant-negative (DN) effects over the remaining wild-type protein. However, the context in which the DN effects are observed is not well understood. We have therefore generated 'knock-in' mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to investigate the effects of expressing a commonly found hot-spot p53 mutant, R246S -- the mouse equivalent of human R249S, which is associated with hepatocellular carcinomas. We demonstrate here that R246S mutant p53 exhibits DN effects with respect to target gene expression, cell survival and cell cycle arrest both in cells that are in the undifferentiated state and upon differentiation. The knock-in cells contain higher levels of p53 that localizes to the nucleus even in the absence of genotoxic stress and yet remains non-functional, reminiscent of mutant p53 found in human tumours. In a model based on carbon-tetrachloride-induced liver injury, these cells were consistently highly tumorigenic in vivo, similar to p53(-/-) cells and in contrast to both p53(+/+) and p53(+/-) ES cells. These data therefore indicate that the DN effects of mutant p53 are evident in the stem-cell context, in which its expression is relatively high compared with terminally differentiated cells.
This open-label study examined the potential efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of children and adolescents diagnosed with dysthymia over a period of 3 months. Seven subjects were evaluated by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), by the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S), and the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Seventy-one percent of patients had a satisfactory response, suggesting the efficacy of paroxetine in children with dysthymia.
We report on 2 patients with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) which developed a few weeks after they had started treatment with venlafaxine and paroxetine, respectively. Due to the temporal relationship and the exclusion of other potential causes, a causal relationship between the use of the antidepressants and SIADH seems likely. Diagnostic criteria for SIADH and the role of drugs, especially serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, are discussed.
Cadmium (Cd) administered to female C57BL/6 mice on gestation day 8 induces a high incidence of anterior neural tube defects (exencephaly). This adverse effect can be attenuated by maternal pretreatment with zinc (Zn). In this study we used replicated microarray analysis and real-time PCR to investigate gene expression changes induced in the embryo 5 and 10h after maternal Cd exposure in the absence or presence of Zn pretreatment. We report nine genes with a transcriptional response induced by Cd, none of which was influenced by Zn pretreatment, and two genes induced only by combined maternal Cd exposure and Zn pretreatment. We discuss the results in relation to the possibility that Cd is largely excluded from the embryo, that the teratogenic effects of Cd may be secondary to toxicity in extraembryonic tissues, and that the primary protective role of Zn may not be to reverse Cd-induced transcription in the embryo.
Submicroscopic chromosomal anomalies play an important role in the aetiology of intellectual disability (ID) and have been shown to account for up to 10% of non-syndromic forms. We present a family with two affected boys compatible with X-linked inheritance of a phenotype of severe neurodevelopmental disorder co-segregating with a deletion in Xp22.11 exclusively containing the PTCHD1 gene. Although the exact function of this gene is unknown to date, the structural overlap of its encoded patched domain-containing protein 1, the transmembrane protein involved in the sonic hedgehog pathway, and its expression in human cortex and cerebellum as well as in mice and drosophila brain suggests a causative role of its nullisomy in the developmental phenotype of our family. Our findings support the recent notions that PTCHD1 may play a role in X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and autism disorders.
Leishmaniasis is an important protozoan disease. In the Americas it is produced by several species of the genus Leishmania, transmitted by sand flies of the genus Lutzomyia. Disease spectrum ranges from cutaneous ulceration to more serious involvement of oronasal mucosa that may progress to destruction of central structures of the face and to the life-threatening visceral forms. Leishmania Viannia braziliensis is the most widespread species in Brazil and is often associated with mucosal involvement. Cutaneous lesions are commonly localised in uncovered areas of the body. Genital lesions are rare.
A patient with an ulcerated lesion of the glans penis, followed subsequently by mucosal lesions of the nasal cavity and palate, is presented. Diagnostic procedures were: leishmanin skin test (Montenegro's test) and biopsy of the ulcer border processed for histopathological examination and culture in NNN medium.
Leishmanin skin test was positive. Histopathology showed a granulomatous infiltrate containing some parasites. Culture was positive for Leishmania sp., and was later identified by zymodeme analysis and monoclonal antibodies as L.(V.) braziliensis. The patient was treated with pentavalent antimony at the dose of 10 (mg/kg)/day for 30 days and the lesions healed.
In men, especially over 50 years of age, ulceration of the glans penis is highly suggestive of carcinoma. Precise differential diagnosis is imperative. A lesion, such as the one reported, may cause diagnostic difficulties when it presents in countries different from the source, where the condition is very uncommon. This is increasingly frequent in the current era of widespread air travel.
The combination of L-tryptophan and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) has been reported to be an effective antidepressant regimen. Neurotoxicity has previously been associated with this combination. The author presents two cases of hypomania following the addition of L-tryptophan to an MAOI.
Benefits of cochlear prostheses for the deaf are dependent on survival and excitability of the auditory nerve. Degeneration of deafferented auditory nerve fibers is prevented and excitability maintained by immediate replacement therapy with exogenous neurotrophic factors, in vivo. It is important to know whether such interventions are effective after a delay following deafness, typical for the human situation. This study evaluated the efficacy of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor axokine-1 analogue (CNTF Ax1) application, 2 or 6 weeks postdeafening, in preventing further degeneration and a decrease in excitability. Guinea pigs were deafened and implanted with intracochlear stimulating electrodes, a scala tympani cannula-osmotic pump system, and auditory brainstem response (ABR) recording electrodes. Subjects received BDNF + CNTF Ax1 or artificial perilymph (AP) treatment for 27 days, beginning at 2 or 6 weeks following deafening. Electrical (E) ABR thresholds increased following deafening. After 1 week, in the 2-weeks-delayed neurotrophic factor treatment group, EABR thresholds decreased relative to AP controls, which were statistically significant at 2 weeks. In the 6-week delay group, a tendency to enhanced EABR sensitivity began at 2 weeks of treatment and increased thereafter, with a significant difference between neurotrophic factor- and AP-treated groups across the treatment period. A clear, statistically significant, enhanced survival of spiral ganglion cells was seen in both neurotrophic factor treatment groups relative to AP controls. These findings demonstrate that BDNF + CNTF Ax1 can act to delay or possibly even reverse degenerative and, likely apoptotic, processes well after they have been activated. These survival factors can rescue cells from death and enhance electrical excitability, even during the period of degeneration and cell loss when the spiral ganglion cell population is reduced by >50% (6 weeks). It is noteworthy that this same degree of ganglion cell loss, secondary to receptor damage, is typically observed after a period equivalent to some years of deafness in humans.
There has been only one report available that focuses on the treatment with imatinib mesylate of two individual persons with aggressive fibromatosis. The authors concluded that after long-term treatment, for 9 and 11 months, with imatinib mesylate, both patients demonstrated radiographic and clinical responses. The novel therapy should be considered as salvage in patients with aggressive fibromatosis expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alfa, beta (PDGFR-alfa, PDGFR-beta), and/or c-kit, whose tumors are uncontrollable by the standard management. On the other hand, the number of kinases blocked by imatinib mesylate is notching up, for instance the tyrosine kinase, which is associated with macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR).
The patient was suffering from aggressive fibromatosis after prior therapy including surgery (R2), radiotherapy, and systemic treatment with combination of tamoxifen and sulindac. The tumor specimen was immunostained for PDGFR-beta and c-kit (CD117), and PDGFR-alfa and cytokines platelet-derived growth factor-alfa and beta were not assessed. The tests for both assessed molecules revealed negative results. In spite of this, the patient underwent a unique treatment with imatinib mesylate at the dose of 400 mg orally once daily for 3 years and 2 months.
After three months of the therapy, radiographic (met criteria of SD but small decrease of the tumor was noted) and clinical responses were recorded for the first time. The same was seen after 6 and 13 months of therapy continuation with imatinib mesylate. Currently, the patient is treated with imatinib mesylate (400 mg orally once daily) without any toxicity effects. The last MRI revealed readily a smaller tumor (35 x 20 mm) after such a therapy lasted more than 3 years.
Treatment with imatinib mesylate has been a well-accepted therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). There have been established four kinases (p210(bcr/abl), c-kit, PDGFR-alfa, PDGFR-beta) suggested as the target for imatinib mesylate. Other potential targets will be discovered as it has lately been determined that M-CSFR kinase activity was blocked by imatinib mesylate. The salvage therapy for aggressive fibromatosis with imatinib mesylate seems to be an attractive opportunity for patients with the advanced disease, whose prior therapy failed.
