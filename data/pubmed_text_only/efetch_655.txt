An effective therapeutic regimen for the treatment of acne vulgaris is presented. The emphasis is based upon correcting a defect in keratinization of the sebaceous follicles with a combination of vitamins A and E. This prevents the formation of milia and comedones, thus depriving the Propionibacterium acnes of a culture medium. Vitamin E also prevents irritating lipid peroxidation of sebum, damaged by bacterial growth, which may be responsible for the inflammatory aspects of acne. No antibiotics were employed in the series of 98 consecutive cases examined herein.
The efficient clearance of toxic bile acids such as lithocholic acid (LCA) requires drug-metabolizing enzymes. We therefore assessed the influence of pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) treatment on LCA-induced hepatotoxicity and disposition of LCA metabolites using female farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-null and wild-type mice. Marked decreases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities, and hepatic tauroLCA (TLCA) concentrations were found in LCA-fed wild-type mice co-treated with PCN. Whereas induction of Cyp3a and hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (Sult2a) proteins was observed in FXR-null and wild-type mice, clear increases in biliary 3alpha-sulfated TLCA but not total 6alpha-hydroxy LCA (taurohyodeoxycholic acid and hyodeoxycholic acid) were only observed in PCN-treated wild-type mice. Biliary 3alpha-sulfated TLCA output rate was increased 7.2-fold, but accounts for only 4.2% of total bile acid output rate in LCA and PCN-co-treated wild-type mice. Total 3alpha-sulfated LCA (LCA and TLCA) was, however, the most abundant bile acid component in faeces suggesting that efficient faecal excretion of biliary 3alpha-sulfated TLCA through escape from enterohepatic circulation. FXR-null mice, which have constitutively high levels of the Sult2a protein, were fed a diet supplemented with 1% LCA and 0.4% dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a typical Sult2a substrate/inhibitor. The faecal total 3alpha-sulfated bile acid excretion was reduced to 62% of FXR-null mice fed only the LCA diet. Hepatic TLCA concentration and serum AST activity were significantly higher in FXR-null mice fed DHEA and LCA diet than in FXR-null mice fed the LCA diet or DHEA diet. These results suggest that hepatic formation of 3alpha-sulfated TLCA is a crucial factor for protection against LCA-induced hepatotoxicity.
Potentiation of haloalkane hepatotoxicity by ketones and ketogenic agents is a well-known phenomenon. The importance of the CCl4 dosage in these combinations, however, has not been explored. Its influence was investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Dose-effect curves for potentiation were generated using 1,3-butanediol, methyl n-butyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone as potentiation agents. Animals were orally treated with these compounds prior to a challenge of CCl4 (0 to 0.5 ml/kg, ip). Liver injury was assessed by monitoring plasma ALT activity and bilirubin concentrations after CCl4 treatment. The minimal effective dosage (MED) for each potentiator was used as the criterion of comparison for each combination. The MED values were determined from the plasma ALT data. Results showed that when the CCl4 dosage was increased from 0.01 to 0.10 ml/kg, the MED of each potentiator decreased 10-fold. For a given potentiator, the product of the CCl4 dosage (H, "hepatotoxicant") by the corresponding MED value (P, "potentiator") remained the same in this range of CCL4 dosages. The severity of the liver injury was similar. These findings suggest that a given level of liver injury induced by a ketone/haloalkane combination could be evaluated on the basis of the [P X H] product.
Two fatal cases of amiodarone-induced acute, confluent, necrotic hepatitis are described. The patients, aged 28 and 60, had received a high loading dose of amiodarone. After the first and second day respectively following the administration of amiodarone, the patients developed jaundice, hepatomegaly, high serum transaminases, a prolonged prothrombin time and low cholesterol concentration. They died of hepatic coma and acute renal failure on the fourteenth and fourth day respectively. Needle liver biopsy, performed immediately after death, revealed lesions of acute drug-induced hepatitis with confluent and bridging necrosis. It is proposed that rapid administration of a high loading dose of amiodarone can cause acute confluent necrotic hepatitis. The mode of administration and the dosage of the drug should be re-considered.
We determined the effects of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on hsp90 and its client proteins Her-2, AKT, and c-Raf, as well as evaluated the cytotoxic effects of co-treatment of SAHA with trastuzumab or docetaxel in human breast cancer BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells containing amplification of Her-2.
The cells were treated with SAHA (1.0-5.0 micromol/L) and/or trastuzumab (5-40 microg/mL) or docetaxel (5-20 nmol/L). Following this, apoptosis and the levels of p21(WAF1), p27(KIP1), AKT, c-Raf, and Her-2, as well as of the key regulators of apoptosis were determined. Synergistic interaction between drugs was evaluated by median dose-effect analysis.
Treatment with SAHA up-regulated p21(WAF1) and p27(KIP1) levels, increased the percentage of cells in G2-M phase of the cell cycle, as well as induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. This was associated with up-regulation of the pro-death Bak and Bim, as well as with attenuation of the levels of Her-2 and XIAP, survivin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-x(L) proteins. SAHA treatment induced acetylation of hsp90. This reduced the chaperone association of Her-2 with hsp90, promoting polyubiquitylation and degradation of Her-2. SAHA also attenuated the levels of c-Raf and AKT. Co-treatment with SAHA significantly increased trastuzumab or docetaxel-induced apoptosis of BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells. Additionally, median dose-effect analysis revealed that co-treatment with SAHA and trastuzumab or docetaxel induced synergistic cytotoxic effects against the breast cancer cells.
These preclinical findings support the development of SAHA in combination with docetaxel and/or trastuzumab against Her-2-amplified breast cancer.
To investigate the additive ocular hypotensive effect of latanoprost on the intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction induced by a suboptimal dose of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.
A short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked study.
Twenty-four patients with glaucoma with elevated IOPs.
Acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily from day 1 to day 18. Topical 50 micrograms/ml latanoprost or placebo eye drops bilaterally instilled once daily from day 4 to day 18.
IOP, conjunctival hyperemia.
The mean IOP of 19.5 mmHg during acetazolamide treatment was further reduced to 16.8 mmHg after topical administration of latanoprost, i.e., a decrease of 2.9 +/- 2.8 mmHg (15%, P < 0.001). Administration of placebo to patients on acetazolamide resulted in an upward drift of 1.3 mmHg (6%, P = 0.03). A modest but statistically significant increase in conjunctival hyperemia was found in the latanoprost-treated group, but did not affect the masking.
This short-term study indicates that the combination of topically applied latanoprost and a suboptimal dose of systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is useful in the management of glaucoma.
Antithrombotic activity of methanolic extract of an edible lichen, Umbilicaria esculenta, was evaluated on platelet aggregation in vitro and pulmonary thrombosis in vivo. The extract showed concentration dependent inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation induced by ADP, with IC(50) value of 2.4 mg/mL. Orally administered extract protected mice against thrombotic death or paralysis induced by collagen and epinephrine in a dose dependent manner. It produced a significant inhibition of thrombotic death or paralysis at over 100 mg/kg body weight, while aspirin produced a significant inhibition of thrombosis at 10-20 mg/kg body weight. Mouse tail bleeding time was significantly prolonged by addition of the extract. On the other hand, the extract did not show any fibrinolytic activity and alter coagulation parameters such as activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) in rat platelet. These results suggested that the antithrombotic activity of Umbilicaria esculenta extract might be due to antiplatelet activity rather than anticoagulation activity.
The relationship between induction of central sensitization and facilitation of temporal summation to repetitive stimulation is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate temporal summation before and after the induction of secondary hyperalgesia by two different experimental methods: capsaicin injection and controlled heat injury. The effect of each injury model was assessed on a separate day with an interval of at least 5 days. Twelve healthy volunteers participated. Each experiment was performed using electrical, radiant heat, mechanical impact, and punctuate stimuli consecutively. The pain threshold (PT) to a single stimulus and the summation threshold to five repetitive stimuli for electrical (2 Hz) and radiant heat (0.83 Hz) were assessed within the secondary hyperalgesic area. The degree of temporal summation for stimulus intensities of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 times the baseline pain thresholds were evaluated by the increase in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores from the first to the fifth stimulus of the train. Further, the degrees of temporal summation were assessed for mechanical impact and punctuate stimuli within the primary and secondary hyperalgesic areas. The contra-lateral forearm served as control (no injury). The pain threshold and the summation threshold to electrical and heat stimuli decreased significantly within the secondary hyperalgesic area after the injury induced by both heat injury or capsaicin injection. However, there was no temporal summation for heat and electrical stimuli in either model. In contrast, for the mechanical impact and punctuate mechanical stimuli the degree of temporal summation was significantly facilitated in the secondary hyperalgesic areas compared with the baseline and the control arm in both models. In the primary hyperalgesic area, the degree of temporal summation was facilitated to mechanical impact and punctuate stimuli but only following the capsaicin injection. In conclusion, the temporal summation mechanism for mechanical stimuli was facilitated in the secondary hyperalgesic area.
This study assessed the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on cognitive functioning, using an intravenous (IV) rodent model that closely mimics the pharmacokinetics seen in humans after smoking or IV injection and that avoids maternal stress and undernutrition. Cocaine-exposed males were significantly impaired on a 3-choice, but not 2-choice, olfactory serial reversal learning task. Both male and female cocaine-exposed rats were significantly impaired on extradimensional shift tasks that required shifting from olfactory to spatial cues; however, they showed no impairment when required to shift from spatial to olfactory cues. In-depth analyses of discrete learning phases implicated deficient selective attention as the basis of impairment in both tasks. These data provide clear evidence that prenatal cocaine exposure produces long-lasting cognitive dysfunction, but they also underscore the specificity of the impairment.
Host answers to pathogen attacks define the course of pathogenic events and decide about the fate of the host organism. Infection with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) can induce severe myocarditis and pancreatitis. The interplay between host factors and virus components is crucial for the fate of the infected host. As we have shown before, expression of the pro-apoptotic host protein Siva is significantly increased after CVB3 infection, and infected cells are removed by programmed cell death. Analysis of Siva expressed in Escherichia coli revealed that this protein binds three zinc ions, suggesting a rather complex three-dimensional structure. By screening a human heart cDNA library we found a new interaction partner of Siva. The peroxisomal membrane protein PMP22 may be involved in the host response against CVB3. Previous investigations showed that Siva interacts with the cytoplasmic C-terminus of CD27, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor group, and transmits an apoptotic signal. With the help of directed two-hybrid assays we determined the N-terminal part of Siva as the binding region for CD27.
The developing nervous system is preferentially vulnerable to lead exposure with alterations in neuronal and glial cells of the brain. Chronic exposure to lead (Pb2+) causes deficits of learning and memory in children and spatial learning deficits in developing rats. Brn-3a is a member of the Pit-Oct-Unc (POU) family of transcription factors that is expressed predominantly in neuronal cells. It exists in two forms, with the long form containing 84 amino acids at the N-terminus that are lacking in the short form. The N-terminal domain unique to the long form induces expression of the Bcl-2 gene and protects neuronal cells against apoptosis whereas the C-terminal POU domain common to both forms is sufficient for activating a number of other neuronally expressed genes and stimulating neuronal process outgrowth. We examined Brn-3a protein and RNA expression in rat brain following low-level lead exposure during development and subsequent effects on spatial learning and memory. Two groups of rats were investigated: a control group and a lead-exposed group (0.2% lead acetate in the drinking water of the dam from gestational day 15 to postnatal day 21). Levels of Brn-3a were measured in rat cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, both protein and mRNA levels were reduced in lead-exposed group (p < 0.05). In Morris water maze, we found spatial learning deficits in rats of lead-exposed group (p < 0.05). These data suggest that the alteration of Brn-3a may play a key role in the mechanisms underlying lead neurotoxicity.
Patients with end-stage liver disease due to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with a persistent viral replication are generally denied liver transplantation (LT). We report the case of a patient who presented with the emergence of a YMDD escape mutant virus under lamivudine treatment, and developed terminal liver failure requiring LT. Pre-LT introduction of adefovir led to only a mild decrease in replication. The patient was treated with a combination of intravenous hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) that was started perioperatively, and also continued lamivudine and adefovir after LT. One year after LT, there was no evidence of HBV infection recurrence. This observation suggests that persistent high HBV replication might not be a contra-indication to LT, providing adequate and effective prophylaxis is given, using HBIG and antiviral drug combination therapy.
The present study concerns the clinical appraisal of adverse reactions reported in the course of Rifampicin (RMP) treatment, reactions which have given rise to conflicting reports. The lot studied included 243 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis of which 57 were treated according to the 7/7 regime (600 mg RMP), 152 according to the 2/7 regimen (900-1200 mg RMP) and 34 according to the 7/7 followed by the 2/7 regimen. Tolerance to RMP was followed up by a series of adequate tests and close clinical surveillance. Adverse reactions developed in 31.5% to 41.5% of the cases in terms of the treatment scheme. In the intermittent treatment adverse reactions occurred in 17.1% of the cases.
We report a case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease in a 30-year-old patient who was receiving interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The intraocular inflammation responded to systemic corticosteroid and mycophenolate mofetil treatment. Physicians should be aware of the association between interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy for hepatitis C virus infection and the development of VKH disease.
Calcium carbonate is frequently used in large doses as a phosphorus binder in hemodialysis patients, which often results in hypercalcemia. In most studies in which calcium carbonate is prescribed to control serum phosphorus levels the patients are not given calcitriol. However, calcitriol may be necessary for suppression of parathyroid hormone. The risk of hypercalcemia when calcium supplements are used in conjunction with calcitriol has not previously been examined in detail. We reviewed the charts of 74 hemodialysis patients (119 patient dialysis years) to determine the relationship of serum calcium to calcitriol, calcium therapy, and PTH levels. Twenty-eight patients (38%) were hypercalcemic at some point. Calcitriol therapy significantly increased the risk of hypercalcemia, independently of calcium therapy (p = 0.032). However, patients on a low dose of calcitriol were more than twice as likely to be hypercalcemic than patients on higher doses. Mean PTH levels were lower in the patients on the lower doses of calcitriol, indicating less severe hyperparathyroid disease. We conclude that hypercalcemia is a common complication in hemodialysis patients on calcitriol and calcium carbonate. Whether lowering the dialysate calcium, as suggested by other investigators, will successfully decrease the risk of hypercalcemia without worsening hyperparathyroidism remains to be determined.
The primary objective of this study was to determine and characterize surrogate biomarkers that can predict nephrotoxicity induced by mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) using urinary proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectral data. A procedure for (1)H NMR urinalysis using pattern recognition was proposed to evaluate nephrotoxicity induced by HgCl₂ in Sprague-Dawley rats. HgCl₂ at 0.1 or 0.75 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.), and urine was collected every 24 h for 6 days. Animals (n=6 per group) were sacrificed 3 or 6 days post-dosing in order to perform clinical blood chemistry tests and histopathologic examinations. Urinary ¹H NMR spectroscopy revealed apparent differential clustering between the control and HgCl₂ treatment groups as evidenced by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square (PLS)-discriminant analysis (DA). Time- and dose-dependent separation of HgCl₂-treated animals from controls was observed by PCA of ¹H NMR spectral data. In HgCl₂-treated rats, the concentrations of endogenous urinary metabolites of glucose, acetate, alanine, lactate, succinate, and ethanol were significantly increased, whereas the concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate, allantoin, citrate, formate, taurine, and hippurate were significantly decreased. These endogenous metabolites were selected as putative biomarkers for HgCl₂-induced nephrotoxicity. A dose response was observed in concentrations of lactate, acetate, succinate, and ethanol, where severe disruption of the concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate, citrate, formate, glucose, and taurine was observed at the higher dose (0.75 mg/kg) of HgCl₂. Correlation of urinary (1)H NMR PLS-DA data with renal histopathologic changes suggests that ¹H NMR urinalysis can be used to predict or screen for HgCl₂-induced nephrotoxicity.
Interindividual variability in response to chemicals and drugs is a common regulatory concern. It is assumed that xenobiotic-induced adverse reactions have a strong genetic basis, but many mechanism-based investigations have not been successful in identifying susceptible individuals. While recent advances in pharmacogenetics of adverse drug reactions show promise, the small size of the populations susceptible to important adverse events limits the utility of whole-genome association studies conducted entirely in humans. We present a strategy to identify genetic polymorphisms that may underlie susceptibility to adverse drug reactions. First, in a cohort of healthy adults who received the maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen (4 g/d x 7 d), we confirm that about one third of subjects develop elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase, indicative of liver injury. To identify the genetic basis for this susceptibility, a panel of 36 inbred mouse strains was used to model genetic diversity. Mice were treated with 300 mg/kg or a range of additional acetaminophen doses, and the extent of liver injury was quantified. We then employed whole-genome association analysis and targeted sequencing to determine that polymorphisms in Ly86, Cd44, Cd59a, and Capn8 correlate strongly with liver injury and demonstrated that dose-curves vary with background. Finally, we demonstrated that variation in the orthologous human gene, CD44, is associated with susceptibility to acetaminophen in two independent cohorts. Our results indicate a role for CD44 in modulation of susceptibility to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. These studies demonstrate that a diverse mouse population can be used to understand and predict adverse toxicity in heterogeneous human populations through guided resequencing.
This paper presents a rapid and sensitive method for the determination and chiral separation of amphetamines and related designer drugs in hair samples. The substances are extracted from hair matrix by a 30 min treatment with a saturated carbonate buffer at pH 10 under ultrasonication. A commercial chiral derivatizing agent, trifluoroacetyl-prolyl chloride, is then added to the solution that is directly extracted with hexane and subsequently analyzed by GC/MS in SIM mode. R and S isomers of amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA and MDEA can be separated and detected with a limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mg for amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDA, and of 0.2 ng/mg for MDMA and MDEA. The method was then applied to 12 samples from suspected amphetamines abusers, showing the presence of both isomers of amphetamine and MDMA in one sample (27 and 1.5 ng/mg, respectively) and of MDMA in further eight samples, in concentrations ranging from traces to 2.7 ng/mg. No differences were observed in the disposition of different isomers in hair.
We aim to investigate the critical window of susceptibility to toluene exposure during brain development and the effects of fetal and neonatal toluene exposure on the expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits and related transduction pathway in infant mice hippocampus. Pregnant mice (GD 14), male offspring (postnatal day; PND 2) or PND 8 were exposed to either a filtered air control (0ppm), or 5, or 50ppm of toluene for 6h per day for 5 consecutive days. On PND 21, the expression levels of NMDA receptor subunits, cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB)-1, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)-IV, and apoptotic related genes (Bax, Bcl) mRNAs in the hippocampus were estimated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses. NR2B, CaMKIV and CREB1 mRNAs increased significantly in the hippocampus of mice exposed to 50ppm toluene on PND 2-6. In contrast, almost all memory function-related gene mRNAs and proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic ratio increased significantly in mice exposed to 5 or 50ppm toluene on PND 8-12. However, mice exposed to toluene on GD 14-18 showed no significant change. Increased active caspase-3 immunoreactive cells were found in hippocampal CA1 area of PND 21 male mice exposed to 5ppm toluene during PND 8-12. Our results suggest that late postnatal period may be a vulnerable and critical period to toluene exposure. Then, we have also examined the effect of toluene exposure in brain development on learning ability in young adult mice and found that poor spatial learning performance in PND 49 male mice exposed to 5ppm toluene during critical period. This is the first study to show that the early toluene exposure induces persistent of the alteration of memory function-related genes in infant mice and memory deficit in later life via modulating the synaptic morphology and function.
Irritable bowel syndrome is a common cause of abdominal pain and discomfort and may be related to disordered gastrointestinal motility. Our aim was to assess the effects of long-term treatment with a prokinetic agent, cisapride, on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Thirty-eight patients with IBS (constipation-predominant, n = 17; diarrhoea-predominant, n = 21) underwent 24-h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week's treatment [cisapride, 5 mg three times daily (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19)].
In diarrhoea-predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the cisapride and placebo groups. In cisapride-treated diarrhoea-predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +/- 0.2 sec, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.4 cont./min, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +/- 1.1 cont./min] than patients treated with placebo. No significant differences in jejunal motility were found in the constipation-predominant IBS group. Symptoms were assessed by using a visual analogue scale before and after treatment. Symptom scores relating to the severity of constipation were lower in cisapride-treated constipation-predominant IBS patients [score, 54 +/- 5 versus 67 +/- 14 mm, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 62 +/- 19 mm]. Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients had a higher pain score after cisapride therapy [score, 55 +/- 15 versus 34 +/- 12 mm, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 67 +/- 19 mm].
Cisapride affects jejunal contraction characteristics and some symptoms in IBS.
It has already been established that during the treatment with rifampicin severe adverse reactions may occur, especially mediated by immune mechanisms. The most severe are those followed by renal failure. This type of reactions usually occur in patients that have undergone previous long treatments with the drug (RMP), given intermittently, twice a week, who, after an intermission, take up again the treatment with rifampicin. The symptoms occur after the administration of the first dose of the second course. Three cases are presented in the paper, of renal failure that developed after a new course of rifampicin was started. In spite of the treatment applied, which included hemodialysis, two of the patients died. In all three the indirect Coombs test was positive for anti -- RMP antibodies, and the histopathologic investigation revealed extensive lesions, including necrosis, of the renal tubules. Diagnostic, prognostic, pathogenic and therapeutic aspects of the cases are discussed.
Aluminum phosphide (ALP) is highly toxic to the lungs, heart and blood vessels causing pulmonary edema, shock and arrhythmias. There is massive focal myocardial damage resulting in raised cardiac enzymes. This study included 92 patients of proven ALP poisoning. The age varied between 20-50 years and the majority (74) were females. Clinical manifestations were nausea and vomiting (92), dyspnea and palpitation (72 each), cyanosis (54), hypotension (32) and shock (46) etc. Cardiac arrhythmias were present in 80 cases and hypermagnesemia in 78 patients. Mean serum magnesium level (1.95 +/- 0.18 mE/l) was significantly (p less than 0.01) raised compared to mean magnesium level in control subjects (1.62 +/- 0.26 mEq/l). Hypermagnesemia results from myocardial and liver damage and to our knowledge has not been described in the literature. Of 92 cases studied, 66 died, 60 of whom died within 24 hours of ALP ingestion. Treatment is supportive.
Lithium therapy can cause a confusional state by direct toxicity, precipitation of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, or by interplay with other neuroleptic medications to produce neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin syndrome. These conditions resemble each other clinically, but EEG may help differentiate among them. We reviewed the EEG patterns with triphasic waves or rhythmic delta activity in lithium toxic patients and discuss clinical and EEG differentiation among syndromes. Lithium toxicity poses significant diagnostic challenges from EEG and clinical perspectives.
Pinacidil, a new vasodilator compound, has been shown to lower blood pressure in animals and humans by a direct vasodilator effect. We have studied the effects of pinacidil on experimental cardiac arrhythmias in dogs. Pinacidil did not exhibit antiarrhythmic activity on ouabain-induced arrhythmias. In contrast, verapamil had minor antiarrhythmic activity on the ouabain arrhythmia, restoring sinus rhythm in one-third of the dogs studied. Pinacidil suppressed the arrhythmia present 22-24 h after coronary artery ligation at doses which produced a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure. The antiarrhythmic action of pinacidil was not modified by pretreatment with propranolol but appeared to be blunted by the infusion of the alpha-agonist, phenylephrine. Other hypotensive agents, hydralazine and sodium nitroprusside, although producing similar reductions in mean arterial pressure to pinacidil, did not exhibit a consistent antiarrhythmic action in dogs 22-24 h after coronary artery ligation. The calcium antagonist verapamil did not display antiarrhythmic activity on this model. The mechanisms by which pinacidil exerted an antiarrhythmic action have not yet been elucidated. The results of the present study suggest that further studies with pinacidil on myocardial infarct size, myocardial perfusion, and experimental cardiac arrhythmias would be advantageous.
The impact of oral captopril, 2 mg . kg-1, on the dose and on the hemodynamic and hormonal effects of nitroprusside was studied in seven patients (Group II). A comparable group (Group I, n = 7) received nitroprusside alone. In both groups, nitroprusside produced comparable decreases in mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and right atrial pressure; cardiac output increased because of a significant change in heart rate. Although plasma renin activity increased significantly (compared with control values) in both groups, it was greater (p = 0.01) through the operative period in patients pretreated with captopril. Plasma aldosterone concentration increased in Group I (p = 0.01) but decreased in Group II (p = 0.01). Plasma catecholamine concentrations increased (p = 0.01) with nitroprusside alone but were unchanged in captopril-treated patients. Plasma converting enzyme activity was markedly inhibited (p = 0.001) by captopril. Following cessation of nitroprusside infusion in Group I, rebound hypertension occurred in conjunction with a significant (p = 0.01) increase in systemic vascular resistance; it was associated with elevated plasma renin activity, catecholamines, and aldosterone concentrations. In contrast, captopril-treated patients showed no rebound hemodynamic changes. Nitroprusside dose was less (p = 0.01) with captopril pretreatment (2.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.9 microgram . kg-1 . min-1). Thus, captopril is a useful adjunct to nitroprusside-induced hypotension.
Mycobacterial excretory secretory-31 (SEVA TB ES-31) antigen is shown to possess protease and lipase activities.
To study the effect of commonly used HIV-protease inhibitors and lipase inhibitor Orlistat if any on mycobacterial ES-31 serine protease in vitro enzyme activity and on the growth of M.tb H37Ra bacilli in axenic culture.
Effect of HIV-protease inhibitors namely Ritonavir, Lopinavir and Indinavir and Orlistat on protease activity of ES-31 was assessed using azocasein assay and on bacillary growth in axenic culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra. The concentration of ES-31 antigen in culture filtrate was determined by sandwich peroxidase ELISA using anti ES-31 antibody and the growth of bacilli by CFU count.
HIV-protease inhibitors such as Ritonavir, Lopinavir and Indinavir and lipase inhibitor Orlistat inhibited serine protease activity by 41.3 - 69.7% in vitro. These inhibitors also showed decreased bacterial growth in axenic culture and further confirmed by decreased concentration of ES-31 serine protease secretion in the culture fluid. Ritonavir showed maximum inhibition of 77% on the growth of the bacilli in axenic culture while anti obesity drug Orlistat showed 61% inhibition.
SEVA TB ES-31 with serine protease and lipase activities may be a potential drug target in tuberculosis management.
