Mustard oil [allyl isothiocyanate (AITC)] and cinnamaldehyde (CA), agonists of the ion channel TRPA1 expressed in sensory neurons, elicit a burning sensation and heat hyperalgesia. We tested whether these phenomena are reflected in the responses of lumbar spinal wide-dynamic range (WDR) neurons recorded in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Responses to electrical and graded mechanical and noxious thermal stimulation were tested before and after cutaneous application of AITC or CA. Repetitive application of AITC initially increased the firing rate of 52% of units followed by rapid desensitization that persisted when AITC was reapplied 30 min later. Responses to noxious thermal, but not mechanical, stimuli were significantly enhanced irrespective of whether the neuron was directly activated by AITC. Windup elicited by percutaneous or sciatic nerve electrical stimulation was significantly reduced post-AITC. These results indicate that AITC produced central inhibition and peripheral sensitization of heat nociceptors. CA did not directly excite WDR neurons, and significantly enhanced responses to noxious heat while not affecting windup or responses to skin cooling or mechanical stimulation, indicating a peripheral sensitization of heat nociceptors.
A 58-year-old man was treated for abdominal and inguinal recurrence of a centroblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma with high doses of methotrexate and cytosine arabinoside. A chest radiogram, taken on the 18th day of chemotherapy to exclude pulmonary infiltration, revealed pneumoperitoneum. The patients's complaints were merely of abdominal fullness and persisting diarrhoea. His general state was hardly impaired, the abdomen soft on palpation with active peristalsis.
There was aplastic anaemia (haemoglobin 9.9 g/dl, erythrocytes 3.4 x 10(6)/microliters, white cells 1000/microliters, platelets 20,000/microliters. Plain film of the abdomen and abdominal computed tomography confirmed pneumoperitoneum. Intraluminal air had caused wall dissection in the ascending and transverse colon (pneumatosis coli as cause of the pneumoperitoneum).
There was complete absorption of the free abdominal air by the 29th day of chemotherapy under parenteral nutrition and metronidazole (3 x 500 mg daily).
3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM), a major product of indole-3-carbinol derived from vegetables of the genus Brassica, exhibits chemotherapeutic activity and various immune modulatory effects in animal models and in vitro studies. Although extensive studies have only focused on DIM's beneficial effects, the toxic effects of DIM on the immune systems have not been clearly elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the immunotoxic effects of DIM in a neonatal mouse and to further evaluate whether DIM administration affects rotavirus (RV)-induced gastroenteritis. Interestingly, multiple immunotoxic effects were observed in the DIM treated group, including decreases in various immune cells (F4/80(+), CD11c(+), CD19(+), and CD3(+) cells) in the spleen, induction of splenic white pulp atrophy, an increase in immune cell apoptosis, and decreased expression of various toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the spleen and small intestine. Apoptosis was notably promoted by up-regulating caspase-3 activity and by the change in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax activities. Finally, oral administration of DIM led to deterioration of RV-induced intestinal disease and delayed viral clearance in the intestine and MLNs. Our results indicate that oral administration of DIM in neonatal mice induces immunotoxicity and hampers efficient RV clearance in the intestine. This new information about the immunotoxic roles of DIM in a newborn mouse model may provide valuable clues for the development of a safe supplement, especially one designed for human infants.
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we investigated the effect of the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor tolcapone 100 or 200 mg three times daily on activities of daily living and motor function in 298 patients with parkinsonism receiving levodopa but without motor fluctuations. At 6 months, both dosages of tolcapone produced significant reductions in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores for activities of daily living (Subscale II) and motor function (Subscale III) and in the total score for Subscales I to III. These improvements were maintained up to the 12-month assessment. At 6 months, both tolcapone groups had changes in levodopa dosage that were significantly different from placebo: the tolcapone groups had decreases in mean total daily dose of levodopa, whereas the placebo group had a mean increase. Tolcapone was well tolerated. The principal adverse events were levodopa-related, but these were generally mild or moderate. Diarrhea was the most frequent nondopaminergic adverse event. Tolcapone appears to be beneficial in the treatment of patients with parkinsonism who have not yet developed motor fluctuations.
The identification of a safe and reliable alternative for patients with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced urticaria/angioedema is a frequent problem for dermatologists and other practitioners. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been reported to be safe for NSAID-intolerant patients from the US and Europe but not all of them have yet been approved for use in Japan. It was our objective to investigate the clinical manifestations of oral NSAID challenges in Japanese patients with histories of urticaria and/or angioedema after the intake of NSAIDs and to find safe alternative drugs, including COX-2 inhibitors and a basic anti-inflammatory drug. Twenty subjects suspected NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema from histories were included in a double-blind or single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge protocol using NSAIDs. Skin prick tests using NSAIDs, which were dissolved in saline, were conducted. The mean age of the patients was 37.3 years; 14 patients were female. The results of other challenge tests showed that the most frequently intolerated drugs was loxoprofen (100%), followed by acetyl salicylic (94.4%), etodolac (53.3%), dicrofenac (50%), acetaminophen (38.5%), meloxicam (33%), and tiaramide (21.4%). Urticaria and angioedema were induced after aspirin intake in 83.3% and 22.2% of patients, respectively, whereas an asthmatic response was seen in 5.6%. Skin prick tests with NSAIDs were 100% negative. This study showed that among the NSAIDs that are available in Japan and that were investigated in this study, tiaramide, which does not inhibit COX, is the relatively safe alternative drug for Japanese patients with NSAID-induced urtiacaria and/or angioedema. Furthermore, meloxicam seems to be better tolerated than etodolac between two selective COX-2 inhibitors.
Two populations of critical care patients were studied using indices of renal tubular damage (beta 2-microglobulin, enzymes, casts) and indices of glomerular filtration (creatinine, creatinine clearance). The purpose of these studies had been initially to elucidate the type of renal failure typical of the critically ill patient treated with aminoglycoside gentamicin or tobramycin, then to determine its frequency. The second study population included a control group of patients given the nonnephrotoxic cephalosporin moxalactam, in order to assess the specificity of the renal tubular damage criteria for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity versus other types of renal injury in critical care patients. Creatinine rise occurred in approximately 30 per cent of each tobramycin-treated group and in only 12 per cent in the moxalactam control patients (P less than 0.05). Thus, the data indicate that aminoglycosides are associated with an approximate doubling of the renal damage in those older, critically ill patients. Renal tubular damage criteria appear specific for the aminoglycoside effect, but a substantial percentage of the renal damage in this population is not associated with detectable alterations in renal tubular status.
To investigate the modifying effects of eugenol (EUG), a component of cigarette smoke, on lung carcinogenesis, male and female transgenic mice carrying the human prototype c-Ha-ras gene (rasH2 mice) were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 250 mg/kg urethane (UR) or saline, followed by a diet containing 6,000 ppm EUG or basal diet for 26 weeks. Their non-transgenic CB6F1 littermates (non-Tg mice) were also treated in the same manner. In both male and female rasH2 mice, alveolar/bronchiolar hyperplasias, adenomas and carcinomas were observed in all UR-treated groups. However, there were no significant intergroup differences in the incidences and multiplicities of these lesions between the UR alone and UR + EUG groups. In non-Tg mice, alveolar/bronchiolar hyperplasias, adenomas or carcinomas were sporadically observed in UR-treated groups of both sexes, with no significant differences in the incidences and multiplicities between the UR alone and UR + EUG groups. There were no intergroup differences between them in the PCNA-positive ratios of adenomas or carcinomas and the areas of adenomas or carcinomas to the whole lung area examined. The present results suggest that the EUG treatment does not exert modifying effects on lung carcinogenesis induced by UR in both male and female rasH2 mice and non-Tg mice.
To identify the gene responsible for a complex ocular phenotype of late-onset macular degeneration, long anterior zonules (LAZ), and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and to study its expression.
Ocular examination, visual field, fluorescein angiography, and electrophysiology testing were performed. One affected individual was treated with vitamin A. DNA from 55 family members (UM:H389) was used for linkage, mapping, and mutation analysis. Linkage analysis of macular degeneration and LAZ phenotypes was performed independently. Mutations in candidate genes were screened by sequencing. mRNA expression of CTRP5 and MFRP, which are bicistronic genes, was studied by semiquantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in various human tissues. CTRP5 expression was also evaluated by in situ hybridization.
Affected members had LAZ detectable by the third decade and/or macular degeneration by the fourth to fifth decade. A six-month treatment with vitamin A shortened dark adaptation considerably in one affected member. Both conditions mapped independently with zero recombination to 11q23, with maximum lod scores of 3.31 for macular degeneration and 5.41 for LAZ. The same CTRP5 missense mutation was identified in all affected individuals. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and ciliary epithelium (CE) showed highest CTRP5 transcript expression, which was also true for MFRP. CTRP5 tissue expression was confirmed by in situ hybridization.
A single locus at 11q23 is implicated in a complex ocular phenotype involving RPE and CE, tissues of neuroectodermal origin. All individuals with either LAZ and/or macular degeneration carry the same CTRP5 S163R mutation, which is transmitted in autosomal dominant manner.
Oral disinfectants containing chlorhexidine or hexetidine are able to produce disturbances of taste, as demonstrated by Krarup's electrogustometric method and the gustometric method of Harris and Kalmus. Hypo- and dysgeusia are characterized by dissociated disturbances, the most prominent of which concerns the sweet perception. The bitter taste is least affected, whereas the effects on salty and acidic tastes range between that for sweet and bitter. Taste disturbances which include ageusia for 48 h were observed when the tongue was touched with a 20% solution of chlorhexidine. Not only the disinfectants themselves provoked dysgeusia but also other "taste improving" agents (particularly, the volatile oild). In addition to dysgeusia, the authors found disturbances of the mucous membrane sensitivity caused by the test substances.
A 41-year-old chemist developed methyl iodide intoxication. His case is presented with a review of pertinent literature. Characteristics of the poisoning include a delay between exposure and onset of symptoms; early systemic toxicity with congestive changes in the lungs and oliguric renal failure; prominent cerebellar and Parkinsonian neurologic symptoms as well as seizures and coma in severe cases; and psychiatric disturbances that can last from months to years. Although methyl iodide is a rare form of intoxicant, its manifestations are similar to that of poisoning with the other monohalomethanes that are not uncommon.
A case of phrenic nerve paralysis following interpleural analgesia for cholecystectomy is reported. The pre-operative chest X ray was normal but chest X ray after cholecystectomy and interpleural analgesia revealed a raised right hemidiaphragm. This resolved after discontinuation of the interpleural analgesia and was probably a result of phrenic nerve paralysis produced by the interpleural local anaesthetic.
This study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of naringin in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. Rats were pretreated with naringin (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg body weight) orally for a period of 56 days. After the treatment period, ISO (85 mg/kg body weight) was administered subcutaneously to rats at an interval of 24 h for 2 days. There was a significant increase in the levels of total, ester, and free cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and free fatty acids (FFA) in serum and heart and decrease in heart phospholipids (PL) in ISO-induced rats. Altered levels of lipoproteins and activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme reductase A in liver and heart, lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase and lipoprotein lipase in plasma were also observed in ISO-induced rats. Pretreatment with naringin (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) for a period of 56 days significantly decreased the levels of total, ester, and free cholesterol, TG, FFA in serum and heart and increased PL in heart. It also minimized the alterations in serum lipoproteins and lipid metabolic enzymes in ISO-induced rats. Thus, naringin has a lipid-lowering effect in ISO-induced MI rats.
Ambient particulate matter (PM) air pollution is associated with coronary heart disease, but the pathways underlying the association remain to be elucidated.
We studied the association between PM and ischemia among 57,908 Women's Health Initiative clinical trial participants from 1999-2003. We used the Minnesota Code criteria to identify ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, and estimated T amplitude (microvolt) from resting, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). We used U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's monitor data to estimate concentrations of PM < 2.5 microm (PM(2.5)) at geocoded participant addresses over 6 days before the ECGs (lag0 through lag5). We excluded 2,379 women with ECG QRS duration > or = 120 msec.
Overall, 6% of the remaining 55,529 women (52-90 years of age; 83% non-Hispanic white) had ST abnormalities and 16% had T abnormalities. Lead-specific T amplitude was normally distributed (range of means from -14 to 349 microV). PM(2.5) (mean +/- SD) averaged over lag(0-2) was 14 +/- 7 microg/m(3). In logistic and linear regression models adjusted for demographic, clinical, temporal, and climatic factors, a 10-microg/m(3) increase in lag(0-2) PM(2.5) was associated with a 4% [95% confidence interval (CI), -3%, to 10%] increase in the odds of ST abnormality and a 5% (95% CI, 0% to 9%) increase in the odds of T abnormality. We observed corresponding decreases in T amplitude in all exam sites and leads except lead V1, reaching a minimum of -2 microV (95% CI, -5 to 0 microV) in lead V3.
Short-term PM(2.5) exposure is associated with ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia among postmenopausal women. The principal manifestations include subclinical but potentially arrhythmogenic ST-T abnormalities and decreases in T amplitude.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a component of polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins, and polystyrene and is found in many products. Several reports have revealed potent in vivo effects, because BPA acts as an estrogen agonist and/or antagonist and as an androgen and thyroid hormone antagonist.
We analyzed the effects of neonatal exposure to BPA on the reproductive axis of female Sprague-Dawley rats.
Female rats were injected subcutaneously, daily, from postnatal day 1 (PND1) to PND10 with BPA [500 microg/50 microL (high) or 50 microg/50 microL (low)] in castor oil or with castor oil vehicle alone. We studied body weight and age at vaginal opening, estrous cycles, and pituitary hormone release in vivo and in vitro, as well as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatility at PND13 and in adults. We also analyzed two GnRH-activated signaling pathways in the adults: inositol-triphosphate (IP(3)), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase(1/2) (ERK(1/2)).
Exposure to BPA altered pituitary function in infantile rats, lowering basal and GnRH-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) and increasing GnRH pulsatility. BPA dose-dependently accelerated puberty onset and altered estrous cyclicity, with the high dose causing permanent estrus. In adults treated neonatally with BPA, GnRH-induced LH secretion in vivo was decreased and GnRH pulsatility remained disrupted. In vitro, pituitary cells from animals treated with BPA showed lower basal LH and dose-dependently affected GnRH-induced IP(3) formation; the high dose also impaired GnRH-induced LH secretion. Both doses altered ERK(1/2) activation.
Neonatal exposure to BPA altered reproductive parameters and hypothalamic-pituitary function in female rats. To our knowledge, these results demonstrate for the first time that neonatal in vivo BPA permanently affects GnRH pulsatility and pituitary GnRH signaling.
The antiviral agent amantadine has been used to manage Parkinson's disease or levodopa-induced dyskinesias for nearly 5 decades. Amantadine is often associated with hallucinations as an adverse effect, but a long-term study reported no serious motor complications. We describe an unusual patient who had Parkinson's disease with dropped head syndrome (DHS) caused by amantadine. When the patient, who had DHS while receiving only 2 kinds of antiparkinsonian drugs, was rechallenged with amantadine, DHS developed, accompanied by increased muscle tone in the neck muscles on surface electromyogram. The DHS resolved after the withdrawal of amantadine. Moreover, an intravenous infusion of levodopa did not alter the DHS. These findings collectively suggest that the DHS in our patient was most likely caused directly by amantadine. Our findings suggest that amantadine may carry the risk of augmenting dystonic syndrome in humans.
Our study evaluates the preventive effect of S-allyl cysteine sulfoxide (SACS) on lipid peroxidative products and enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidants in isoproterenol (ISO) induced myocardial infarction in rats. The male Wistar rats were rendered myocardial infarction by ISO (150 mg kg(-1), once a day for two days). The concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lipid hydroperoxides were increased in hearts from ISO-treated rats, whereas the content of enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidants were declined in rats administered ISO. Oral pretreatment with SACS (40 mg kg(-1) and 80 mg kg(-1) daily for a period of 35 days) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the lipid peroxidative products and significantly (p < 0.05) increased antioxidants in ISO-induced rats. Oral administration of SACS (40 mg kg(-1) and 80 mg kg(-1)) did not show any significant effect in normal rats. Thus, the present study shows that SACS exhibits antilipoperoxidative and antioxidant effects in experimental myocardial infarction.
Exposure to combustion-derived fine particulate matter (PM) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality especially in individuals with cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. PM inhalation causes several adverse changes in cardiac function that are reflected in the electrocardiogram (ECG), including altered cardiac rhythm, myocardial ischemia, and reduced heart rate variability (HRV). The sensitivity and reliability of ECG-derived parameters as indicators of the cardiovascular toxicity of PM in rats are unclear.
We hypothesized that spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats are more susceptible to the development of PM-induced arrhythmia, altered ECG morphology, and reduced HRV than are Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, a related strain with normal blood pressure.
We exposed rats once by nose-only inhalation for 4 hr to residual oil fly ash (ROFA), an emission source particle rich in transition metals, or to air and then sacrificed them 1 or 48 hr later.
ROFA-exposed SH rats developed non-conducted P-wave arrhythmias but no changes in ECG morphology or HRV. We found no ECG effects in ROFA-exposed WKY rats. ROFA-exposed SH rats also had greater pulmonary injury, neutrophil infiltration, and serum C-reactive protein than did ROFA-exposed WKY rats.
These results suggest that cardiac arrhythmias may be an early sensitive indicator of the propensity for PM inhalation to modify cardiovascular function.
Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a human carcinogen after inhalation exposure. Humans also ingest Cr(VI) from contaminated drinking water and soil; however, limited data exist on the oral toxicity and carcinogenicity of Cr(VI).
We characterized the chronic oral toxicity and carcinogenicity of Cr(VI) in rodents.
The National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted 2-year drinking water studies of Cr(VI) (as sodium dichromate dihydrate) in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice.
Cr(VI) exposure resulted in increased incidences of rare neoplasms of the squamous epithelium that lines the oral cavity (oral mucosa and tongue) in male and female rats, and of the epithelium lining the small intestine in male and female mice. Cr(VI) exposure did not affect survival but resulted in reduced mean body weights and water consumption, due at least in part to poor palatability of the dosed water. Cr(VI) exposure resulted in transient microcytic hypochromic anemia in rats and microcytosis in mice. Nonneoplastic lesions included diffuse epithelial hyperplasia in the duodenum and jejunum of mice and histiocytic cell infiltration in the duodenum, liver, and mesenteric and pancreatic lymph nodes of rats and mice.
Cr(VI) was carcinogenic after administration in drinking water to male and female rats and mice.
Periodontal disease is a complex, multifactorial, chronic inflammatory disease that involves degradation of periodontal structures, including alveolar bone. Cadmium adversely affects bone remodeling, and it is therefore possible that environmental Cd exposure may be a risk factor for periodontal-disease-related bone loss.
We examined the relationship between environmental Cd exposure and periodontal disease in U.S. adults.
We analyzed cross-sectional data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). We defined periodontal disease as clinical attachment loss of at least 4 mm in > 10% of sites examined. We used multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses to estimate the association between creatinine-corrected urinary Cd levels and periodontal disease.
Of the 11,412 participants included in this study, 15.4% had periodontal disease. The age-adjusted geometric mean urine Cd concentration (micrograms per gram creatinine) was significantly higher among participants with periodontal disease [0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-0.56] than among those without periodontal disease (0.30; 95% CI, 0.28-0.31). Multivariable-adjusted analyses, which included extensive adjustments for tobacco exposure, showed that a 3-fold increase in creatinine-corrected urinary Cd concentrations [corresponding to an increment from the 25th (0.18 microg/g) to the 75th (0.63 microg/g) percentile] was associated with 54% greater odds of prevalent periodontal disease (odds ratio = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.26-1.87). We observed similar results among the subset of participants who had limited exposure to tobacco, but only after removing six influential observations.
Environmental Cd exposure was associated with higher odds of periodontal disease.
Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is the most common type of chronic urticaria, and pruritus is the most prominent symptom. Antihistamines are the first-line treatment for CIU. Sedation and anticholinergic adverse effects are often experienced with the first-generation antihistamines and there is a risk of cardiovascular adverse effects and drug interactions with some second-generation agents. Hence, new treatment options are needed. Desloratadine is a new, potent, nonsedating antihistamine that has an excellent cardiovascular safety profile.
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of desloratadine in the treatment of moderate-to-severe CIU. A total of 190 patients, aged 12-79 years, with at least a 6-week history of CIU and who were currently experiencing a flare of at least moderate severity, were randomly assigned to therapy with desloratadine 5 mg or placebo once daily for 6 weeks. Twice daily, patients rated the severity of CIU symptoms (pruritus, number of hives, and size of largest hive), as well as the impact of CIU symptoms on sleep and daily activity. Patients and investigators jointly evaluated therapeutic response and overall condition. Safety evaluations included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and changes from baseline in vital signs, laboratory parameters, and ECG intervals.
Desloratadine was superior to placebo in controlling pruritus and total symptoms after the first dose and maintained this superiority to the end of the study. Measures of sleep, daily activity, therapeutic response, and global CIU status were also significantly better with desloratadine after the first dose; these clinical benefits were also maintained throughout the 6-week study. No significant adverse events occured.
Desloratadine 5 mg daily is a safe and effective treatment for CIU with significant benefits within 24 h and maintained through the treatment period.
Hypothyroidism is the most common thyroid abnormality in patients treated with high doses of iodine-131 (131I). Data on risk of hypothyroidism from low to moderate 131I thyroid doses are limited and inconsistent.
This study was conducted to quantify the risk of hypothyroidism prevalence in relation to 131I doses received because of the Chornobyl accident.
This is a cross-sectional (1998-2000) screening study of thyroid diseases in a cohort of 11,853 individuals < 18 years of age at the time of the accident, with individual thyroid radioactivity measurements taken within 2 months of the accident. We measured thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, and antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (ATPO) in serum.
Mean age at examination of the analysis cohort was 21.6 years (range, 12.2-32.5 years), with 49% females. Mean 131I thyroid dose was 0.79 Gy (range, 0-40.7 Gy). There were 719 cases with hypothyroidism (TSH > 4 mIU/L), including 14 with overt hypothyroidism. We found a significant, small association between (131)I thyroid doses and prevalent hypothyroidism, with the excess odds ratio (EOR) per gray of 0.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.21). EOR per gray was higher in individuals with ATPO < or = 60 U/mL compared with individuals with ATPO > 60 U/mL (p < 0.001).
This is the first study to find a significant relationship between prevalence of hypothyroidism and individual (131)I thyroid doses due to environmental exposure. The radiation increase in hypothyroidism was small (10% per Gy) and limited largely to subclinical hypothyroidism. Prospective data are needed to evaluate the dynamics of radiation-related hypothyroidism and clarify the role of antithyroid antibodies.
Along with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), the beta-adrenergic receptor blockers have gradually emerged to be standard in the therapy of heart failure. Individual beta-blockers that have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure include bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol. Carvedilol distinguishes from the other beta-blockers as being a non-selective beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptor blocker with (1)-receptor blockade effect and anti-oxidant properties. The drug does not have sympathomimetic activity and has vasodilatory effects attributable to its (1)-receptor blockade property. Experimental and clinical studies have confirmed carvedilol's vasodilator, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, which may contribute to its effect in reversing cardiac remodelling in animal models and patients with heart failure. These pharmacological properties render carvedilol a potentially useful agent in the treatment of patients with heart failure. Early studies of carvedilol in heart failure have reported beneficial haemodynamic effects but variable effects on exercise tolerance and clinical well being. The large-scale US Carvedilol Heart Failure Program and the Australian/New Zealand Heart Failure Collaborative Research Group reported beneficial effects of carvedilol on mortality, morbidity and clinical well being in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. The recently reported but yet unpublished preliminary results of the COPERNICUS study suggest that carvedilol improves mortality and morbidity in patients with advanced heart failure and severe symptoms. At this time, it is unclear whether the ancillary pharmacological properties of carvedilol can be translated to more superior clinical benefit compared to the other beta-blockers. Preliminary studies examining surrogate end points suggest that carvedilol may improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) more than metoprolol. More conclusive information regarding their relative effects of clinical outcomes will await the completion of the COMET study, which compares the effect of metoprolol and carvedilol on mortality and morbidity, expected at the end of the year 2002.
At various gestational periods, caffeine was injected intra-arterially or intraperitoneally into pregnant rats. The teratogenic effects of caffeine on the fetal heart were dose dependent and detectable at relatively low concentrations. The most susceptible stage was during septation of the heart. The most common cardiovascular malformation was ventricular septal defect. Extracardiovascular anomalies, such as decreased thymic weight and degeneration of the lens, were found in all fetuses; skeletal malformations were found in some fetuses.
Niacin is underutilized due to flushing, which occurs in over 90% of niacin-treated patients. Laropiprant (LRPT) reduces flushing associated with niacin. This study compared flushing with a combination tablet of extended-release (ER) niacin (ERN)/LRPT to niacin ER (N-ER; without LRPT) during the first week of therapy among patients in Asia.
Following a 1-week placebo run-in, 332 patients with dyslipidemia from China, Korea and Singapore were randomized to ERN/LRPT 1 g/20 mg, N-ER 1 g (given as Niaspan(R)) or placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio for 1 week. Patient-reported flushing severity was assessed using the Global Flushing Severity Score (GFSS; none/mild = 0-3; moderate = 4-6; severe = 7-9; extreme = 10).
Compared with N-ER, the ERN/LRPT group experienced significantly less flushing (p < 0.001), as measured by maximum GFSS categorized as none/mild, moderate, severe or extreme. Overall, 23.8% of patients in the ERN/LRPT group and 50.0% in the N-ER group (p < 0.001), versus 12.1% in the placebo group, had moderate or greater flushing (GFSS > or =4). Except for flushing, which occurred more frequently in the N-ER group, ERN/LRPT had a safety/tolerability profile similar to that of N-ER.
ERN/LRPT produced significantly less flushing than N-ER during the initiation of therapy and was generally well tolerated in Asian patients with dyslipidemia.
