Recent evidence shows that reexpression and upregulation of angiotensin II (ANG II) type 2 (AT2) receptor in adult tissues occur during pathological conditions such as tissue hyperplasia, inflammation, and remodeling. In particular, expression of functional AT2 receptors in the pituitary and their physiological significance and regulation have not been described. In this study, we demonstrate that chronic in vivo estrogen treatment, which induces pituitary hyperplasia, enhances local AT2 expression (measured by Western blot and RT-PCR) concomitantly with downregulation of ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptors. In vivo progesterone treatment of estrogen-induced pituitary hyperplasia did not modify either the ANG II receptor subtype expression pattern or octapeptide-induced and AT1-mediated calcium signaling. Nevertheless, an unexpected potentiation of the ANG II prolactin-releasing effect was observed in this group, and this response was sensitive to both AT1 and AT2 receptor antagonists. These data are the first to document that ANG II can act at the pituitary level through the AT2 receptor subtype and that estrogens display a differential regulation of AT1 and AT2 receptors at this level.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most widespread chemicals in the world and is suspected of being responsible for male reproductive impairments. Nevertheless, its molecular mode of action on spermatogenesis is unclear. This work combines physiology and toxicogenomics to identify mechanisms by which BPA affects the timing of meiosis and induces germ-cell abnormalities.
We used a rat seminiferous tubule culture model mimicking the in vivo adult rat situation. BPA (1 nM and 10 nM) was added to the culture medium. Transcriptomic and meiotic studies were performed on the same cultures at the same exposure times (days 8, 14, and 21). Transcriptomics was performed using pangenomic rat microarrays. Immunocytochemistry was conducted with an anti-SCP3 antibody.
The gene expression analysis showed that the total number of differentially expressed transcripts was time but not dose dependent. We focused on 120 genes directly involved in the first meiotic prophase, sustaining immunocytochemistry. Sixty-two genes were directly involved in pairing and recombination, some of them with high fold changes. Immunocytochemistry indicated alteration of meiotic progression in the presence of BPA, with increased leptotene and decreased diplotene spermatocyte percentages and partial meiotic arrest at the pachytene checkpoint. Morphological abnormalities were observed at all stages of the meiotic prophase. The prevalent abnormalities were total asynapsis and apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis sustained immunocytological observations.
We showed that low doses of BPA alter numerous genes expression, especially those involved in the reproductive system, and severely impair crucial events of the meiotic prophase leading to partial arrest of meiosis in rat seminiferous tubule cultures.
Large-scale hemizygous loss of chromosome 3p is a common event in neuroblastoma, occurring preferentially in tumors that exhibit loss of chromosome 11q and lack MYCN amplification. Although numerous tumor suppressor genes (TSG) have been mapped to the 3p region, the gene or genes contributing to neuroblastoma pathogenesis have remained elusive. High-resolution oligonucleotide array CGH mapping of chromosome 3p breakpoints relative to the positions of known TSGs indicates that more than one gene may contribute to neuroblastoma pathogenesis. We evaluated the methylation status of semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B), one of the chromosome 3p TSGs, in neuroblastoma tumors with (n = 12) and without (n = 32) 3p deletions. A significantly higher percentage of methylated CpG sites in the SEMA3B promoter was detected in tumors exhibiting 3p loss (95%), relative to tumors without loss (52%), suggestive of a two-hit mechanism of allele inactivation. The involvement of methylation in the control of SEMA3B expression was confirmed by treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. Transcriptional regulation of this locus is complex, however; low levels of SEMA3B expression were also seen in tumors with unmethylated SEMA3B promoters (n = 4). SEMA3B is known to play an important role in the development of normal sympathetic neurons, and interestingly, we found higher levels of SEMA3B expression in differentiated tumors with favorable histopathology (n = 19) than in tumors with unfavorable histology (n = 22). Furthermore, SEMA3B was upregulated in the SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cell line following induction of differentiation with retinoic acid. The association of SEMA3B expression with neuroblastoma differentiation suggests that this TSG may play a role in neuroblastoma pathobiology.
To identify associations between cocaine exposure during pregnancy and medical conditions in newborn infants from birth through hospital discharge.
Multisite, prospective, randomized study.
Brown University, University of Miami, University of Tennessee (Memphis), and Wayne State University. Subjects A total of 717 cocaine-exposed infants and 7442 nonexposed infants.
Results of physical examination and conditions observed during hospitalization.
Cocaine-exposed infants were about 1.2 weeks younger, weighed 536 g less, measured 2.6 cm shorter, and had head circumference 1.5 cm smaller than nonexposed infants (all P<.001). Results did not confirm previously reported abnormalities. Central and autonomic nervous system symptoms were more frequent in the exposed group: jittery/tremors (adjusted odds ratio, 2.17; 99% confidence interval, 1.44-3.29), high-pitched cry (2.44; 1.06-5.66), irritability (1.81; 1.18-2.80), excessive suck (3.58; 1.63-7.88), hyperalertness (7.78; 1.72-35.06), and autonomic instability (2.64; 1.17-5.95). No differences were detected in organ systems by ultrasound examination. Exposed infants had more infections (3.09; 1.76-5.45), including hepatitis (13.46; 7.46-24.29), syphilis (8.84; 3.74-20.88), and human immunodeficiency virus exposure (12.37; 2.20-69.51); were less often breastfed (0.26; 0.15-0.44); had more child protective services referrals (48.92; 28.77-83.20); and were more often not living with their biological mother (18.70; 10.53-33.20).
Central and autonomic nervous system symptoms were more frequent in the exposed cohort and persisted in an adjusted analysis. They were usually transient and may be a true cocaine effect. Abnormal anatomic outcomes previously reported were not confirmed. Increased infections, particularly sexually transmitted diseases, pose a serious public health challenge. Exposure increased involvement of child protective services and out-of-home placement.
We examined changes in nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in the striatum in methamphetamine (METH)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, and also examined effects of treatment with drugs possessing PPAR gamma agonistic properties. The marked reduction of nuclear PPAR gamma-expressed cells was seen in the striatum 3 days after METH injections (4 mg/kg x 4, i.p. with 2-h interval). The reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT)-positive signals and PPAR gamma expression, and accumulation of activated microglial cells were significantly and dose-dependently attenuated by four injections of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a PPAR gamma ligand, ibuprofen (10 or 20 mg/kg x 4, s.c.) given 30 min prior to each METH injection, but not by either a low or high dose of aspirin. Either treatment of ibuprofen or aspirin, that showed no effects on METH-induced hyperthermia, significantly blocked the METH-induced striatal cyclooxygenase (COX) expression. Furthermore, the treatment of an intrinsic PPAR gamma ligand 15d-PG J2 also attenuated METH injections-induced reduction of striatal DAT. Therefore, the present study suggests the involvement of reduction of PPAR gamma expression in METH-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together with the previous report showing protective effects of other PPAR gamma ligand, these results imply that the protective effects of ibuprofen against METH-induced neurotoxicity may be based, in part, on its anti-inflammatory PPAR gamma agonistic properties, but not on its COX-inhibiting property or hypothermic effect.
During treatment of chronic hepatitis C patients with interferon and ribavirin, a lot of side effects are described. Twenty-three percent to 44% of patients develop depression. A minority of patients evolve to psychosis. To the best of our knowledge, no cases of psychogenic parasitosis occurring during interferon therapy have been described in the literature. We present a 49-year-old woman who developed a delusional parasitosis during treatment with pegylated interferon alpha-2b weekly and ribavirin. She complained of seeing parasites and the larvae of fleas in her stools. This could not be confirmed by any technical examination. All the complaints disappeared after stopping pegylated interferon alpha-2b and reappeared after restarting it. She had a complete sustained viral response.
Amphetamine is thought to produce its stimulant effects mainly via the dopamine system, but its effects may also be influenced by other systems. Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors exist as heterodimers with adenosine A1 and A(2A) receptors, which modulate their responsiveness, suggesting that responses to amphetamine may also depend on adenosinergic function. We therefore studied the relevance of one adenosine A1 and three adenosine A(2A) receptor gene polymorphisms for the interindividual variability in amphetamine response in 99 healthy volunteers who received placebo or d-amphetamine (10 or 20 mg). The 1976C/T and 2592C/T(ins) polymorphisms of the adenosine receptor gene were associated with increases in anxiety at both doses. This is consistent with recent observations indicating a role for adenosine A(2A) receptor gene polymorphisms in anxiety.
Dihydroergocryptine (DHECP), an ergot alkaloid with potent dopaminergic activity, was injected acutely or subchronically to aged (24 months old) male rats of the F344 strain, at the dose of 0.05 or 0.1 mg/kg. The immobility in the "despair" test (constrained swim) was longer in 24-month-old rats than in younger animals. This behavioral change was reduced in rats treated subchronically with DHECP, but no significant change was found in animals with acute treatment. Aged rats showed an increased haloperidol-induced catalepsy and a reduced motor performance and coordination as compared to animals of 2 and 10 months of age. Acute treatment with DHECP was followed by an attenuation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy and an improvement of motor performance and coordination of aged rats. Similar results were obtained after subchronic treatment with DHECP, but the effect on the rotorod behavior was more potent after subchronic treatment than after acute injection of the drug. It is possible that the improvement of behavioral deficits of aged rats after the treatment with DHECP depends on the facilitating effect of this drug on central dopamine transmission that may be impaired in these animals.
Adverse drug reactions to azathioprine (AZA), the pro-drug of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), occur in 15% to 28% of patients and the majority are not explained by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency. Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) deficiency results in the benign accumulation of the inosine nucleotide ITP. 6-MP is activated through a 6-thio-IMP intermediate and, in ITPase deficient patients, potentially toxic 6-thio-ITP is predicted to accumulate. The association between polymorphism in the ITPA gene and adverse drug reactions to AZA therapy was studied in patients treated for inflammatory bowel disease. Sixty-two patients with inflammatory bowel disease suffering adverse drug reactions to AZA therapy were genotyped for ITPA 94C>A and IVS2 + 21A>C polymorphisms, and TPMT*3A, *3C, *2 polymorphisms. Genotype frequencies were compared to a consecutive series of 68 controls treated with AZA for a minimum of 3 months without adverse effect. The ITPA 94C>A deficiency-associated allele was significantly associated with adverse drug reactions [odds ratio (OR) 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-11.5, P = 0.0034]. Significant associations were found for flu-like symptoms (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2-18.1, P = 0.0308), rash (OR 10.3, 95% CI 4.7-62.9, P = 0.0213) and pancreatitis (OR 6.2,CI 1.1-32.6, P = 0.0485). Overall, heterozygous TPMT genotypes did not predict adverse drug reactions but were significantly associated with a subgroup of patients experiencing nausea and vomiting as the predominant adverse reaction to AZA therapy (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.4-21.3, P = 0.0206). Polymorphism in the ITPA gene predicts AZA intolerance. Alternative immunosuppressive drugs, particularly 6-thioguanine, should be considered for AZA-intolerant patients with ITPase deficiency.
Liver fibrosis represents a process of healing and scarring in response to chronic liver injury. Effective therapies for liver fibrosis are lacking. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that downregulates pro-inflammatory responses and has a modulatory effect on hepatic fibrogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether electroporative IL-10 gene therapy has a hepatic fibrolytic effect on mice.
Hepatic fibrosis was induced by administering carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 10 weeks in mice. The human IL-10 expression plasmid was delivered via electroporation after hepatic fibrosis was established. Histopathology, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunoblotting, and gelatin zymography were used to investigate the possible mechanisms of action of IL-10.
Human IL-10 gene therapy reversed CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in mice. RT-PCR revealed that IL-10 gene therapy attenuated liver TGF-beta1, collagen alpha1, fibronectin, and cell adhesion molecule mRNA upregulation. Following gene transfer, both the activation of alpha-smooth muscle actin and cyclooxygenase-2 were significantly attenuated. Furthermore, IL-10 significantly inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) activation after CCl4 intoxication.
We demonstrated that IL-10 gene therapy attenuated CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in mice. IL-10 prevented upregulated fibrogenic and pro-inflammatory gene responses. Its collagenolytic effect may be attributed to MMP and TIMP modulation. IL-10 gene therapy may be an effective therapeutic modality against liver fibrosis with potential clinical use.
It has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance. In addition, working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and/or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls. To address the potential confounding effects of the cannabis use of the ecstasy using group, a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users (Nestor, L., Roberts, G., Garavan, H., Hester, R., 2008. Deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users. Neuroimage 40, 1328-1339). Ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users. A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy-specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions. Ecstasy-specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and left posterior cingulated cortex. In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate. These results elucidated ecstasy-related deficits, only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use. These ecstasy-specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy.
Although orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT EC 2.4.2.10) is a key enzyme related to the first-step activation process of 5-fluorouracil, and therefore it has been shown to be an important enzyme that enables to predict sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil, the clinical and prognostic significance of protein and/or gene expression of OPRT has not been well established in gastric carcinoma. We examined the protein level, and mRNA expression of OPRT in gastric carcinoma tissues and relationships with clinicopathologic factors and prognosis were evaluated. A total of 75 surgically-resected gastric carcinoma tissues were subjected to the study. An enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to accurately assess intratumoral OPRT, and gene expressions of OPRT were examined using a real-time PCR method. Survival of patients with gastric carcinoma in relation to OPRT protein levels was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods along with log-rank test. The mean value of OPRT was 5.4+/-3.6 ng/mg protein, and it was significantly higher in patients with differentiated-type and invasive-type gastric carcinoma. The prognosis of patients in the high OPRT group was better than for those with low OPRT (p<0.05). There was a significant correlation between OPRT levels measured by ELISA and OPRT mRNA expression (p<0.05). Determination of OPRT levels is a useful tool to predict the biological characteristics of gastric carcinoma and possibly predict sensitivity to fluoropyrimidine-based anticancer chemotherapy,particularly dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase-inhibitory fluoropyrimidine, in patients with gastric carcinoma.
Meperidine is a widely prescribed opioid analgesic used in a variety of clinical situations. The parent compound has central nervous system depressant effects. However, the sole active metabolite, normeperidine, is a central nervous system excitatory agent and has the ability to cause seizures, especially in patients with renal failure. Patients with normal renal function rarely manifest seizure activity when given meperidine, but if the drug is used in large doses at frequent dosing intervals, seizures may occur. Reported here is the case of a man with normal renal function who had a tonic-clonic seizure due to meperidine that was administered for the pain of underlying chronic pancreatitis.
End organ effects of nonpulsatile (NP) and pulsatile (P) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) flow were compared in a canine model of doxorubicin-induced heart failure. After heart failure induction, a prototype bimodal LVAD was implanted. Hemodynamics, cardiac dimensions, and myocardial metabolism were monitored with the LVAD off (baseline) and on (in NP and P modes at 70% or 100% power). End organ perfusion was assessed by colored microsphere analysis. Seven dogs were used: two died before pump implantation and were excluded from analysis, and the remaining five survived to study termination. At 70% NP, ascending aortic flow and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) decreased significantly. At 100% NP, LV dimensions decreased, aortic systolic, pulse, and LV pressures decreased but not significantly, and ascending aorta flow reversed. At 100% NP, coronary blood flow, MVO2, and LV free wall subepicardial and subendocardial blood flows decreased significantly. However, as NP support increased, the subepicardial/subendocardial blood flow ratio remained near baseline. At 100% NP, right ventricular perfusion decreased but not significantly, cerebral perfusion decreased significantly, and renal perfusion stayed constant. P mode results were similar, except that ascending aorta flow decreased significantly at 100% P instead of reversing as at 100% NP. These results suggest that end organ perfusion is not differentially affected by LVAD flow mode during chronic heart failure.
This study analyzed the relationship between four renin-angiotensin system (RAS) gene polymorphisms and the response to blood pressure lowering and development of microalbuminuria in 206 patients with essential hypertension treated once daily for 12 months with telmisartan 80 mg. Seated cuff blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) were measured throughout the study. Patients were screened for the presence of the A-6G variant of the angiotensinogen gene, angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism, and the A1166C and C573T polymorphisms of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene. No significant association was found between the presence of any gene polymorphism and the reduction of blood or UAE following telmisartan treatment. The results indicate that these RAS gene polymorphisms do not affect the antihypertensive activity and renoprotection in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients treated with telmisartan.
Topiramate, an anticonvulsant medication, may be effective as a treatment for alcohol and cocaine addiction. While a recent clinical study has demonstrated the potential utility of topiramate for smoking cessation in alcohol-dependent smokers, the effects of topiramate on tobacco addiction have not been systematically examined in humans.
To determine topiramate's effects on acute physiological and subjective responses to intravenous (IV) nicotine in overnight abstinent smokers.
Seven male and five female smokers participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, which consisted of one adaptation and three experimental sessions. Before each session, participants were treated orally with either a single 25 or 50 mg topiramate dose or with placebo. Starting 2 h following the medication treatment, participants received an IV saline injection, followed by 0.5 and 1.0 mg/70 kg IV nicotine.
Topiramate treatment at 50 mg, compared to 25 mg or placebo, attenuated heart rate increases induced by nicotine. Topiramate, compared to placebo, enhanced the ratings of subjective effects from nicotine including "drug strength," "good effects," "head rush," and "drug liking." Topiramate treatment did not affect performance on the Stroop test.
These results suggest that topiramate may enhance the subjective effects of nicotine and attenuate the heart rate response to nicotine. While the exact mechanisms are unclear, enhancement of the dopaminergic system and attenuation of the noradrenergic system may mediate the topiramate's effects on the subjective and cardiovascular responses to nicotine, respectively. The utility of topiramate for smoking cessation needs to be examined further in controlled clinical trials.
Autism is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a significant genetic component. Existing research suggests that multiple genes contribute to autism and that epigenetic effects or gene-gene interactions are likely contributors to autism risk. However, these effects have not yet been identified. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, has been implicated in autism etiology. Fourteen known autosomal GABA receptor subunit genes were studied to look for the genes associated with autism and their possible interactions. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were screened in the following genes: GABRG1, GABRA2, GABRA4, and GABRB1 on chromosome 4p12; GABRB2, GABRA6, GABRA1, GABRG2, and GABRP on 5q34-q35.1; GABRR1 and GABRR2 on 6q15; and GABRA5, GABRB3, and GABRG3 on 15q12. Intronic and/or silent mutation SNPs within each gene were analyzed in 470 white families with autism. Initially, SNPs were used in a family-based study for allelic association analysis--with the pedigree disequilibrium test and the family-based association test--and for genotypic and haplotypic association analysis--with the genotype-pedigree disequilibrium test (geno-PDT), the association in the presence of linkage (APL) test, and the haplotype family-based association test. Next, with the use of five refined independent marker sets, extended multifactor-dimensionality reduction (EMDR) analysis was employed to identify the models with locus joint effects, and interaction was further verified by conditional logistic regression. Significant allelic association was found for markers RS1912960 (in GABRA4; P = .01) and HCV9866022 (in GABRR2; P = .04). The geno-PDT found significant genotypic association for HCV8262334 (in GABRA2), RS1912960 and RS2280073 (in GABRA4), and RS2617503 and RS12187676 (in GABRB2). Consistent with the allelic and genotypic association results, EMDR confirmed the main effect at RS1912960 (in GABRA4). EMDR also identified a significant two-locus gene-gene effect model involving RS1912960 in GABRA4 and RS2351299 in GABRB1. Further support for this two-locus model came from both the multilocus geno-PDT and the APL test, which indicated a common genotype and haplotype combination positively associated with disease. Finally, these results were also consistent with the results from the conditional logistic regression, which confirmed the interaction between GABRA4 and GABRB1 (odds ratio = 2.9 for interaction term; P = .002). Through the convergence of all analyses, we conclude that GABRA4 is involved in the etiology of autism and potentially increases autism risk through interaction with GABRB1. These results support the hypothesis that GABA receptor subunit genes are involved in autism, most likely via complex gene-gene interactions.
Pregabalin inhibits release of excess excitatory neurotransmitters, presumably by binding to the alpha2-delta subunit protein of widely distributed voltage-dependent calcium channels in the brain and spinal cord.
To assess the anxiolytic efficacy of pregabalin in patients with generalized anxiety disorder.
Double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator trial. Patients were randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with pregabalin, 300 mg/d (n = 91), 450 mg/d (n = 90), or 600 mg/d (n = 89); alprazolam, 1.5 mg/d (n = 93); or placebo (n = 91).
Psychiatry research and clinic settings.
Outpatients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, with a baseline Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total score of 20 or greater.
Change from baseline to end point in total HAM-A score in the pregabalin and alprazolam groups compared with the placebo group. The end point response criterion was 50% or greater reduction in the HAM-A total score.
Pregabalin and alprazolam produced a significantly greater reduction in mean +/- SE HAM-A total score at last-observation-carried-forward end point compared with placebo (-8.4 +/- 0.8): pregabalin, 300 mg (-12.2 +/- 0.8, P<.001), 450 mg (-11.0 +/- 0.8, P = .02), and 600 mg (-11.8 +/- 0.8, P = .002), and alprazolam (-10.9 +/- 0.8, P = .02). By week 1 and at last-observation-carried-forward end point, the 3 pregabalin groups and the alprazolam group had significantly (P<.01) improved HAM-A psychic anxiety symptoms compared with the placebo group. Compared with the placebo group, HAM-A somatic anxiety symptoms were also significantly (P<.02) improved by the 300- and 600-mg pregabalin groups, but not by the 450-mg pregabalin (week 1, P = .06; week 4, P = .32) and the alprazolam groups (week 1, P = .21; week 4, P = .15). Of the 5 treatment groups, the 300-mg pregabalin group was the only medication group that differed statistically in global improvement at treatment end point not only from the placebo group but also from the alprazolam group.
Pregabalin was significantly more efficacious than placebo for the treatment of psychic and somatic symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and was well tolerated by most study patients.
Cystometric recordings were performed in pentobarbitone anaesthetized rats and the effects of baclofen on urinary bladder function were evaluated as their influence on bladder hyperactivity induced by 1-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) after peripheral decarboxylase inhibition. The bladder response was inhibited by intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v., 4th ventricle, 0.1 microgram) as well as by systemically administered (10 mg/kg i.v.) baclofen. Intravenous naloxone but not i.v. bicuculline i.c.v. substance P or i.c.v. glutamate antagonized the inhibitory actions of i.c.v. or/and i.v. baclofen. It is suggested that baclofen depresses the hyperactive bladder by a central action that is unrelated to bicuculline sensitive gamma aminobutyric acid mechanisms, substance P or glutamate neurotransmission but that is possibly related to interference with opioid mechanisms.
The effects of long-term (mean 3.9 months) pharmacotherapy of hypertensive and normotensive hypertrophy (hypertensive heart disease, hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy) as well as of advanced cardiac disease due to coronary artery disease and dilatative cardiomyopathy by large doses of nifedipine (mean 120 mg/day-1) were analyzed with regard to systolic blood pressure, to left ventricular function and to the hypertrophy degree of the ventricle. Nifedipine, in addition to conventional and maintained antihypertensive and cardiac therapy, lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients, whereas hypotensive effects in the normotensive patients were absent. Nifedipine enhances left ventricular function in all patient groups significantly, i.e. in normotensive hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy, in hypertensive heart disease and especially in heart disease due to coronary artery disease and dilatative cardiomyopathy. Significant regression of septal and of global hypertrophy was found in hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy and in hypertensive heart disease. These results indicate, that long-term nifedipine treatment may be beneficial for left ventricular function in all patient groups and for hypertrophy regression in established left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertrophic, non-obstructive cardiomyopathy and due to hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy. It is concluded that long-term nifedipine treatment improves left ventricular function and leads to regression of established ventricular wall hypertrophy in hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy and in hypertensive heart disease.
Methapyrilene, [N,N-dimethyl-N'-pyridyl-N'(2-thienylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine] (MP) was withdrawn from, clinical use due to reported periportal hepatic necrosis and hepatocarcinogenicity in the rat, via S-oxidation of the thiophene group. In this study MP is used as a model hepatotoxin to further characterise the functional consequences of S-oxidation of the thiophene group in vivo, in rat models and in vitro, in freshly isolated rat hepatocyte suspensions. In vivo histological studies revealed the early depletion of glutathione (GSH), which was confined to the damaged periportal area, in contrast to an increase in GSH levels in the centrilobular region. Additionally, the induction of cell defence was demonstrated by an increase in the protein levels of heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and glutamate cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (GCLC) in vivo. Histological examination demonstrated that cytotoxicity progresses initially via apoptosis before an increase in necrosis over the 3-day administration. An apoptotic-like mechanism was observed in vitro via the measurement of cytochrome c release and caspase activation.
This study provides evidence for a complex pathway of MP-induced hepatotoxicity which progresses through early adaptation, apoptosis, necrosis and inflammation, all underpinned by the zonal induction and depletion of GSH within the liver.
Mast cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of asthma and are a promising target for therapeutic intervention in asthma. This study investigated the effects of polydatin (PD), a resveratrol glucoside, on mast cell degranulation upon cross-linking of the high-affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI), as well as the anti-allergic activity of PD in vivo. Herein, we demonstrated that PD treatment for 30 min suppressed FcεRI-mediated mast cell degranulation in a dose-dependent manner. Concomitantly, PD significantly decreased FcεRI-mediated Ca²⁺ increase in mast cells. The suppressive effects of PD on FcεRI-mediated Ca²⁺ increase were largely inhibited by using LaCl₃ to block the Ca²⁺ release-activated Ca²⁺ channels (CRACs). Furthermore, PD significantly inhibited Ca²⁺ entry through CRACs evoked by thapsigargin (TG). Knocking down protein expression of Orai1, the pore-forming subunit of CRACs, significantly decreased PD suppression of FcεRI-induced intracellular Ca²⁺ influx and mast cell degranulation. In a mouse model of mast cell-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), in vivo PD administration suppressed mast cell degranulation and inhibited anaphylaxis. Taken together, our data indicate that PD stabilizes mast cells by suppressing FcεRI-induced Ca²⁺ mobilization mainly through inhibiting Ca²⁺ entry via CRACs, thus exerting a protective effect against PCA.
One hundred women in preterm labor were randomly treated with ritodrine or terbutaline in a double-blind fashion. The drugs were comparably effective during intravenous therapy but, in women with intact membranes, an oral dose of terbutaline, 30 mg daily, was significantly more effective than ritodrine, 120 mg daily, in preventing recurrent labor during a 5-day course of oral therapy (one of 19 versus 12 of 23, p less than 0.001). In women with intact membranes, pregnancy was prolonged 40 +/- 25 days (mean +/- SD) in women receiving terbutaline orally and only 22 +/- 24 days in women receiving ritodrine orally (p less than 0.01). In women with intact membranes, a heart rate greater than or equal to 130 bpm occurred in in a higher proportion of women receiving intravenous treatment with ritodrine than among those receiving terbutaline (20 of 31 versus 8 of 27, p less than 0.05). Terbutaline-treated women, however, were significantly more likely to have a serum glucose level in excess of 140 mg/dl than were women treated with ritodrine (13 of 26 versus 6 of 29, p less than 0.05). Side effects commonly observed during intravenous therapy included nausea (22%), chest pain (15%), and shortness of breath (15%). Side effects were significantly (p less than 0.025) more likely to occur during periods when the infusion rate was being increased rather than during periods when the infusion rate was constant.
