Telavancin is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide anti-infective with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of bacterial membrane phospholipid synthesis and inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. We determined the in vitro activities of telavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin against 268 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive organisms and 31 Corynebacterium strains using agar dilution methods according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards procedures. Plates with daptomycin were supplemented with Ca(2+) to 50 mg/liter. The MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (MIC(90)s) for telavancin and vancomycin were as follows: Actinomyces spp. (n = 45), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium difficile (n = 14), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium ramosum (n = 16), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium innocuum (n = 15), 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium clostridioforme (n = 15), 8 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; Eubacterium group (n = 33), 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; Lactobacillus spp. (n = 26), 0.5 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Propionibacterium spp. (n = 34), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 52), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; and Corynebacterium spp. (n = 31), 0.03 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of TD-6424 was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin for most strains except C. clostridioforme and Lactobacillus casei, where quinupristin-dalfopristin was three- to fivefold more active. Daptomycin had decreased activity (MIC > 4 microg/ml) against 14 strains of Actinomyces spp. and all C. ramosum, Eubacterium lentum, and Lactobacillus plantarum strains. Linezolid showed decreased activity (MIC > 4 microg/ml) against C. ramosum, two strains of C. difficile, and 15 strains of Lactobacillus spp. Imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were active against >98% of strains. The MICs of ampicillin for eight Clostridium spp. and three strains of L. casei were >1 microg/ml. The MIC(90) of TD-6424 for all strains tested was </=2 microg/ml. TD-6424 has potential for use against infections with gram-positive anaerobes and deserves further clinical evaluation.
The present studies investigated whether SDZ 220-581 ((S)-alpha-amino 2'chloro-5-(phosphonomethyl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-propanoic acid), a potent, competitive antagonist at the NMDA glutamate receptor subtype, reversed haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats, a widely used model of Parkinson's disease. SDZ 220-581 (0.32-3.2 mg/kg i.p.) dose- and time-dependently reduced the time spent in an abnormal position induced by haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg s.c.). Compared to other NMDA receptor antagonists the rank order of potency was MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine) > SDZ 220-581 > SDZ EAA 494 (D-CPPene: (S)-(E)-4-(3-phosphonoprop-2-enyl)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid) > SDZ EAB 515 ((S)-alpha-amino-5-(phosphonomethyl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-propanoic acid). Since it has been demonstrate that SDZ 220-581 counters the effects of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) on the motor disturbances of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-pre-treated primates, the results suggest that the reversal of haloperidol-induced catalepsy by competitive NMDA receptor antagonists may not be predictive of efficacy in other models of Parkinson's disease.
A case of necrotizing myopathy due to a short epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) treatment in a 72 year-old patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is described. Pathogenetic hypotheses are discussed.
Single doses of certain organophosphates (OP), such as dibutyl-2,2-dichlorovinyl phosphate (DBDCVP) cause organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) in hens. Clinical effects correlate with inhibition of neuropathy target esterase (NTE) which is considered the target for this toxicity. Pre-treatment with non-neuropathic NTE inhibitors, such as phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), protects from OPIDP. However, when given after OPs, these compounds promote OPIDP. Chicks are relatively resistant to OPIDP despite high NTE inhibition. It has also always been reported that rats represent a species which is resistant to OPIDP and that they might develop morphological but not clinical signs of OPIDP. We report here that clinical OPIDP can be produced in 3.5- and 6-month-old rats by DBDCVP (5 mg/kg s.c.) and that it correlates with high (> 90%) NTE inhibition. When PMSF (120 mg/kg s.c. x 2) was given after DBDCVP, OPIDP was promoted. Pretreatment with PMSF protected from OPIDP. We conclude that resistance to OPIDP in the rat is age-related, as it is in the hen.
Eleven consecutive patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung treated intensively with a combination chemotherapy regimen cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, VP-16, and vincristine experienced peripheral neuropathy. Four of the 11 patients had severe (Grade III) neuropathy, leaving them virtually bedridden; the remaining seven patients had mild to moderate neuropathy. Only 8 of the 14 patients treated less intensively with vincristine and VP-16 had Grade I and II neuropathy. Predisposing factors for severe neuropathy included advanced age and preexisting peripheral neuropathy. All patients' performance status declined and all lost much weight before developing neuropathy. From accumulated treatment experience of small cell carcinoma with vincristine alone or with vincristine, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide combinations, the authors feel that the severe neuropathy observed was due to an interaction of vincristine and VP-16. This conclusion is supported by electron microscopic observation of electronopaque granular degeneration of the myelin lamellae of affected nerve fibers.
Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only drug approved for the treatment of thromboembolic stroke, but it might lead to some neurotoxic side effects. tPA is a highly specific serine proteinase, one of the two principal plasminogen activators and one of the three trypsin-like serine proteinases of the tissue kallikrein family. We have observed that tPA injection in the SN leads to the degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the GABAergic neurons. We also found that tPA injected in the substantia nigra of rats produced the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, the induction of microglial activation, the loss of astroglia and the expression of aquaporin 4 (AQP4), as well as an increase in the expression of NMDA receptors and the brain derived neurothrophic factor (BDNF). All these effects, along with the changes produced in the phosphorylated forms of several MAP kinases and the transcription factor CREB, and the increase in the expression of nNOS and iNOS observed under our experimental conditions, could be involved in the loss of dopaminergic neurons.
Many studies have provided convincing evidence for hERG as an important diagnostic and prognostic factor in human cancers, as well as a useful target for antineoplastic therapy. Our previous study also revealed that knockdown of herg gene expression by shRNA interference inhibited the growth of neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In the experiment, a novel 4-amino piperidine analog, ZC88, was examined for its effect on hERG potassium channels and its antitumor potency was observed in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that ZC88 could block hERG1 and hERG1b channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. ZC88 displayed significant antiproliferative activity in several tumor cell lines and the tumor cells with higher expression of hERG presented higher sensitivity to ZC88. The mitotic progression of tumor cells was markedly suppressed in the presence of ZC88 through arresting cells in G₀/G₁ phase. ZC88 significantly inhibited the tumor growth in nude mice at a dosage with slight influence on the cardiac QT interval. The antitumor effect of ZC88 was correlated at least partly with its blockage of hERG channels, which implicated a positive role of hERG potassium channel in tumor cell proliferation.
Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is associated with tumorigenesis by promoting angiogenesis and metastasis. Although up-regulation of IL-8 is indicated in many cancers, its function in pancreatic cancer has not been well characterized. In this study we examined the expression of IL-8 on pancreatic cancer cells and clinical tissue specimens, and investigated the effect of exogenous IL-8 on gene expression, and signaling in human pancreatic cancer cells. We found that pancreatic cancer cells expressed higher amount of IL-8 mRNA than normal human pancreatic ductal epithelium cells. IL-8 mRNA was also substantially overexpressed in 11 of 14 (79%) clinical pancreatic-adenocarcinoma samples compared with that in their surrounding normal tissues. Exogenous IL-8 up-regulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor(165), and neuropilin (NRP)-2 in BxPC-3 cells, one of human pancreatic cancer cell lines. IL-8 expression was inducible by hypoxia mimicking reagent cobalt chloride. In addition, IL-8 activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway in BxPC-3 cells. Our studies suggest that IL-8 might be a malignant factor in human pancreatic cancer by induction of vascular endothelial growth factor and NRP-2 expression and ERK activation. Targeting IL-8 along with other antiangiogenesis therapy could be an effective treatment for this malignancy.
Dexamethasone is prescribed routinely to reduce cerebral oedema in neurosurgical patients undergoing craniotomy for tumour and is used increasingly as an anti-emetic. Dexamethasone, however, has been shown to cause hyperglycaemia. We describe a case of hyperglycaemic crisis, cerebral oedema and death secondary to dexamethasone in a patient with a frontal meningioma. We highlight the risks of peri-operative dexamethasone and discuss the diagnosis, treatment and complications of hyperglycaemic crises and cerebral oedema.
To investigate possible mechanisms of the hyperalgesia induced by the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) stavudine in rats, we examined neuronal death and inflammatory cytokine secretion in the spinal cord, and cytokine and lactate secretion in the plasma. Stavudine (50 mg kg(-1)) or placebo was administered orally to Sprague-Dawley rats once daily for three or six weeks. In one group, rats' responses to a blunt noxious mechanical stimulus applied to their tails were recorded before and at the end of the period of stavudine or placebo administration. Spinal cords excised from these rats after three and six weeks of stavudine or placebo administration were examined for neuronal necrosis and apoptosis. In a second group of rats, plasma and spinal cord samples collected after three and six weeks of placebo or stavudine administration were examined for changes in CINC-1, IL-6, adiponectin (plasma only) and lactate (plasma only) concentration. Daily stavudine administration induced mechanical hyperalgesia within three weeks, which was sustained until week six, but the hyperalgesia was not associated with neuronal apoptosis or necrosis, or elevated IL-6 concentrations in the spinal cord. The spinal cord concentration of CINC-1 increased, but only after six weeks of stavudine administration, when the hyperalgesia had been established for over three weeks. Stavudine administration did not affect the plasma concentration of IL-6, CINC-1, adiponectin or lactate. Thus, neither peripheral nor central inflammatory cytokine secretion, or neuronal death, or metabolic dysregulation contributed to the development of hyperalgesia in our model of stavudine-induced hyperalgesia in rats.
The clinical presentation and management of a young boy with acute non-oliguric renal failure associated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), ibuprofen, prescribed for the relief of pain is described. Deterioration of renal function developed unexpectedly but fortunately withdrawal of the drug and appropriate management resulted in spontaneous recovery. All NSAIDs have the ability to interfere with renal function and their administration should probably be avoided in children with pre-existing dehydration or with conditions that predispose to an increased risk of renal insufficiency.
The central nervous system (CNS) appears to be the critical target of manganese (Mn), and neurotoxicity has been the focus of most of the health effects of manganese. In brain, the mechanism underlying the Mn-induced cell death is not clear. We have previously demonstrated that NFkappabeta induction and the activation of nitric oxide synthase through reactive oxygen species (ROS) represent a proximate mechanism for Mn-induced neurotoxicity. In this study, an immortalized dopaminergic cells were used to characterize the cell death signaling cascade activated by manganese. Exposure to Mn resulted in a time and concentration-related loss of cell viability as observed by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and live/dead cell assay. Mn increased BNIP3 expression within 3h and continued to increase up to 24h exposure followed by a concentration-related apoptotic death as determined by TUNEL. Further, Mn treatment resulted in accumulation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. Antioxidants significantly reduced Mn-induced BNIP3 expression and attenuated cell death, demonstrating the role of oxidative stress in BNIP3 induction. Blocking BNIP3 up-regulation with a transcription or a translational inhibitor reduced the response to manganese. Cell death by manganese was reduced in the presence of CsA (PT pore inhibitor). In addition, knockdown of BNIP3 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) improved mitochondrial recovery and reduced neuronal cell loss suggesting that constitutive expression of BNIP3 plays a role in Mn-induced neurotoxicity by regulating mitochondrial functions. These findings indicate a potential detrimental role of BNIP3 in manganese-induced neuronal cell death.
Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can damage the fetal brain and lead to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Despite public warnings discouraging alcohol use during pregnancy, many pregnant women continue to drink intermittently because they do not believe that occasional exposures to alcohol can be harmful to a fetus. However, because of genetic differences, some fetuses are much more susceptible than others to alcohol-induced brain injury. Thus, a relatively low quantity of alcohol that may be innocuous to most fetuses could damage a genetically susceptible fetus. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) can protect developing mouse neurons against alcohol toxicity by synthesizing neuroprotective nitric oxide. This study examined whether a single exposure to alcohol, which causes no evident injury in wild type mice, can damage the brains of mice genetically deficient for nNOS (nNOS-/- mice). Wild type and nNOS-/- mice received intraperitoneal injections of alcohol (0.0, 2.2, or 4.4mg/g body weight) either as a single dose on postnatal day (PD) 4 or as repeated daily doses over PD4-9. Brain volumes and neuronal numbers within the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were determined on PD10. Alcohol exposure on PD4-9 restricted brain growth and caused neuronal death in both strains of mice, but the severity of microencephaly and neuronal loss were more severe in the nNOS-/- mice than in wild type. The 4.4 mg/g alcohol dose administered on PD4 alone caused significant neuronal loss and microencephaly in the nNOS-/- mice, while this same dose caused no evident injury in the wild type mice. Thus, during development, a single exposure to alcohol can injure a genetically vulnerable brain, while it leaves a wild type brain unaffected. Since the genes that confer alcohol resistance and vulnerability in developing humans are unknown, any particular human fetus is potentially vulnerable. Thus, women should be counseled to consume no alcohol during pregnancy.
Epidemiologic studies have suggested that organophosphate exposure is associated with an increased risk of depression and suicide. Considering that the neurobiological basis of this association is not well understood, in the present study we evaluated the depressive-like behavior of Swiss mice subchronically exposed to the organophosphate methamidophos at adulthood. From postnatal days 60 to 89 (PN60-PN89), one of two concentrations of methamidophos [higher dose (HiD): 5.25 microg/ml; lower dose (LoD): 1.31 microg/ml] or vehicle was administered in the drinking water. Immobile behavior, an animal model of depressive behavior, was assessed in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests either during (PN88) or after (PN99) the exposure period. On the subsequent day (PN89 or PN100), the Rota-rod and endurance swimming tests were used to evaluate motor performance. Brain acetylcholinesterase activity was quantified. During exposure, the LoD group presented increased immobility in the tail suspension test when compared to controls. The HiD group presented increased immobility in the forced swimming test when compared to LoD and control groups, an effect that emerged after cessation of exposure. There were no motor performance alterations. During exposure, acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited in the HiD (43%) and LoD (15%) groups. After exposure, enzyme activity was reduced (25%) only in the HiD group. There were no signs of systemic toxicity. There were no correlations between acetylcholinesterase activity and behavioral measures. Our results indicate that methamidophos at doses below the threshold for systemic toxicity induces depressive-like behavior in adult mice.
Tumor-induced skeletal muscle wasting involves tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of muscle protein degradation. In this study, growth of the colon-26 adenocarcinoma in mice was associated with diminished gastrocnemius muscle mass and increased muscle levels of actin, ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, free ubiquitin, E3 ubiquitin ligases, and the type 1 TNF receptor (TNFR1). Indomethacin at 1 or 5 mg/kg/day reduced tumor growth and muscle levels of TNFR1. However, only the 5 mg dose of indomethacin reduced muscle wasting and muscle levels of the E3 ligases and actin. These data suggest that the beneficial effects of indomethacin in the treatment of tumor-induced skeletal muscle wasting may involve inhibition of TNF- and ubiquitin-mediated pathways of muscle protein degradation. These data also demonstrate that E3 ligases, which are involved in disuse atrophy, also are associated with tumor-induced skeletal muscle wasting.
Hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) have been associated with several psychotropic drugs e.g., carbamazepine, neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants and more recently selective serotonin reuptake inhibiting (SSRI) antidepressants. SSRIs have gained widespread use in elderly depressed patients because of their favourable adverse effect profile. However, SSRIs have recently been associated increasingly with SIADH. We describe a 82-year old patient who was hospitalised after witnessed convulsions ten days after initiation of fluoxetine therapy for depression. She had hyponatremia and increased urine osmolarity suggesting SIADH. Using this case we discuss the clinical symptoms, aetiology, differential diagnosis and therapy of drug-induced SIADH.
Three hundred and thirty-six patients with a variety of tumors were treated with Adriamycin given weekly as an iv bolus of 1 mg/kg with subsequent doses adjusted for hematologic toxicity. This weekly schedule, not utilizing a loading course, resulted in only a 20% incidence of stomatitis. The number of evaluable patients and the percent with objective responses (respectively) according to tumor type were: lung (57 patients, 14%); sarcoma (62, 24%); breast (31, 35%); transitional cell carcinoma (17, 29%); non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (17, 29%); head and neck (16, 13%); colorectal (13, 0); ovarian (eight, 25%); and other (53, 11%). These response frequencies are comparable to those reported for every-3-week regimens using 60-75 mg/m2 of Adriamycin. Sixteen patients were given 450-550 mg/m2 of Adriamycin, five were given 550-600 mg/m2, and ten were given greater than 600 mg/m2. None of the study patients developed definite evidence of drug-induced congestive heart failure. Therefore, Adriamycin given as a weekly schedule provides a clinically effective alternative to the every-3-week schedule of administration. The weekly schedule is associated with tolerable toxicity and a decreased risk of developing drug-induced congestive heart failure.
We investigated the effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on mucosal levels of leukotrienes (LTs) and lipid peroxide (LPO), and on mucosal microcirculation, in rats with experimental colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).
We fed Wistar rats a perilla oil-enriched diet containing alpha-linolenic acid (63.2% of total fatty acids) with various doses of vitamin E for 4 weeks, with 4% DSS added to the drinking water during the last week. Control rats were fed a diet produced from soybean oil containing alpha-linolenic acid (5.1% of total fatty acids). Colonic mucosal blood flow was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter.
The mucosal level of arachidonic acid was significantly lower and that of eicosapentaenoic acid was significantly higher in the experimental group. The mucosal level of LPO in the experimental group fed a trace or ordinary dose of vitamin E was significantly higher than that of the controls. The production of LTB(4) and LTC(4) from the colonic mucosa in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in controls. However, only the experimental group fed a vitamin E dose 4-fold higher than that given to the controls showed a significant increase in mucosal blood flow.
These results suggest that n-3 PUFAs increase mucosal blood flow by inhibiting LT production when there is sufficient vitamin E to inhibit lipid peroxidation in rats with experimental colitis.
We attempted to elucidate the cerebrovasomotor function of the caudal ventrolateral medulla. Sixty-one rats were anaesthetized, paralysed and artificially ventilated. The microsphere method was employed for the measurement of blood flow. Microinjection of an antagonist of excitatory amino acids, kynurenate (2 nmol), into functionally identified depressor sites within the caudal ventrolateral medulla produced arterial hypertension of about 140 mmHg. We found that the cerebral blood flow was substantially increased, but was maintained at the same level (17 rats) as that observed under phenylephrine-induced hypertension (26 rats). Bilateral severing of the cervical sympathetic trunks resulted in a further increase in blood flow in all brain regions studied (18 rats). The response was most significant in the cerebral parasagittal cortex (164 +/- 31% of baseline without, and 211 +/- 43% with sympathectomy; mean +/- S.D.; P < 0.001). The contributions of the cerebral metabolic mechanism to this flow increase under denervation was minimal, as evidenced by the observation of disproportionately smaller changes in cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen during any type of hypertension. We conclude that the cerebrovasomotor functions of the caudal ventrolateral medulla may operate to keep an equilibrium between simultaneously working tonic inhibitions against sympathetic vasoconstriction as well as against vasodilatation. This dual effect is mediated by excitatory amino acid receptors located within this particular brain area. The vasodilator mechanism may be of neurogenic origin. When the function of the brain area is suppressed, the subsequently disinhibited vasodilator mechanism dominates the cerebrovascular autoregulatory function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Tenofovir-related tubular damage, like all other recently reported cases, occurred in patients receiving the protease inhibitor (PI) ritonavir, often with lopinavir. Increased plasma concentrations of didanosine were also observed after the addition of tenofovir. It was suspected that tenofovir with PIs interacted with renal organic anion transporters, leading to nephrotoxic tubular concentrations of tenofovir and systemic accumulation of didanosine. Until there is a better understanding of these interactions, close monitoring is recommended for patients receiving tenofovir, PIs, and didanosine.
Acute cerebellar toxicity with ataxia and dysarthria is a well-known side effect during high-dose cytarabine therapy. Dose, age, previous neurological disorders, hepatic dysfunction, and renal insufficiency have been inconsistently reported as risk factors. The present paper presents a patient with renal insufficiency who developed severe cerebellar toxicity following treatment with a dose of cytarabine (8 g/m2 over 5 days) not generally expected to be associated with neurotoxicity. Together with a review of the literature, the present case gives evidence of renal insufficiency as a major risk factor in the development of cerebellar toxicity during cytarabine therapy. Reduced doses of cytarabine should be considered in patients with renal impairment.
Effects of lidocaine-HCl on extrafusal muscle fibers in the masseter muscle of developing mice were studied histologically and morphometrically. In the affected region, many extrafusal muscle fibers were circular and smaller in diameter than unaffected extrafusal muscle fibers, and the SDH activity of the affected fibers was very irregular. In lidocaine-HCl injected groups, the ratios of extrafusal muscle fibers with central nuclei to total extrafusal muscle fibers were higher than those in the saline solution-injected groups. The diameters of extrafusal muscle fibers in the masseter muscle treated with lidocaine-HCl were smaller than those in the saline solution-injected groups. These changes in the muscle with lidocaine-HCl continued for 45 days after a single injection. Five injections of lidocaine-HCl into developing mice caused long-term degeneration of the masseter muscle. Thus, the present study suggests that a local anesthetic agent caused degeneration of immature muscle fibers of the masseter muscle in developing mice and may result in long-term decrease of masticatory capacity. Therefore, lidocaine-HCl may inhibit the synchronized development of masticatory organs in developing animals.
Chlorpromazine is frequently administered to patients with hyperprolactinemia to stimulate an increase in the serum levels of prolactin. A patient with a prolactin secreting adenoma is described in whom pituitary apoplexy developed in association with a hypotensive episode following the administration of 25 mg of chlorpromazine. Prolactin levels fell from more than 2,000 ng/ml to 340 ng/ml following infarction of the pituitary tumor. Pituitary apoplexy should be considered as a rare complication of chlorpromazine stimulation in a patient with a pituitary tumor.
We report three cases of visual disturbances associated with use of over-the-counter (OTC) ibuprofen. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such problems associated with OTC ibuprofen. None of these patients included ibuprofen as part of their initial drug histories. All patients particularly younger women with headaches and visual disturbances should be questioned specifically with regard to OTC drugs.
