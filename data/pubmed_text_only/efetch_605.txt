Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) associates with a tissue signature for high transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling but is often caused by heterozygous mutations in genes encoding positive effectors of TGF-β signaling, including either subunit of the TGF-β receptor or SMAD3, thereby engendering controversy regarding the mechanism of disease. Here, we report heterozygous mutations or deletions in the gene encoding the TGF-β2 ligand for a phenotype within the LDS spectrum and show upregulation of TGF-β signaling in aortic tissue from affected individuals. Furthermore, haploinsufficient Tgfb2(+/-) mice have aortic root aneurysm and biochemical evidence of increased canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling. Mice that harbor both a mutant Marfan syndrome (MFS) allele (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) and Tgfb2 haploinsufficiency show increased TGF-β signaling and phenotypic worsening in association with normalization of TGF-β2 expression and high expression of TGF-β1. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that compensatory autocrine and/or paracrine events contribute to the pathogenesis of TGF-β-mediated vasculopathies.
Maternal diabetes increases oxidative stress in embryos. Maternal diabetes also inhibits expression of embryonic genes, most notably, Pax-3, which is required for neural tube closure. Here we tested the hypothesis that oxidative stress inhibits expression of Pax-3, thereby providing a molecular basis for neural tube defects induced by diabetic pregnancy.
Maternal diabetes-induced oxidative stress was blocked with alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), and oxidative stress was induced with the complex III electron transport inhibitor, antimycin A, using pregnant diabetic or non-diabetic mice, primary cultures of neurulating mouse embryo tissues, or differentiating P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Pax-3 expression was assayed by quantitative RT-PCR, and neural tube defects were scored by visual inspection. Oxidation-induced DNA fragmentation in P19 cells was assayed by electrophoretic analysis.
Maternal diabetes inhibited Pax-3 expression and increased neural tube defects, and alpha-tocopherol blocked these effects. In addition, induction of oxidative stress with antimycin A inhibited Pax-3 expression and increased neural tube defects. In cultured embryo tissues, high glucose-inhibited Pax-3 expression, and this effect was blocked by alpha-tocopherol and GSH-ethyl ester, and Pax-3 expression was inhibited by culture with antimycin A. In differentiating P19 cells, antimycin A inhibited Pax-3 induction but did not induce DNA strand breaks.
Oxidative stress inhibits expression of Pax-3, a gene that is essential for neural tube closure. Impaired expression of essential developmental control genes could be the central mechanism by which neural tube defects occur during diabetic pregnancy, as well as other sources of oxidative stress.
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a potent inducer of hydronephrosis in both fetal and neonatal mice. A critical period of sensitivity to TCDD could not be identified for prenatally induced hydronephrosis since the urinary tract appeared equally sensitive throughout organogenesis. To identify the critical period of susceptibility for development of lactationally induced hydronephrosis in neonatal mice, as well as to characterize the potential for recovery from this renal lesion, dose-response and time-course studies were conducted in the postnatal period. Pregnant C57BL/6N mice were allowed natural delivery. In the dose-response phase of this investigation, mothers were administered 0, 3, 6, or 12 micrograms TCDD/kg once by gavage on Postnatal Day (PND) 1, 4, 8, or 14, and dams and pups were euthanized on PND 26. The kidneys were examined, and hydronephrotic severity was scored. The incidence and severity of hydronephrosis were significantly increased above controls only following treatment on PND 1 or 4, while on PND 8 the increase was marginal and pairwise tests were nonsignificant. Following treatment of dams on PND 1, the hydronephrotic response detected in 26-day-old pups was significantly greater than that for all later exposure days. In the time-course study, dams were given a single oral dose of 0 or 9 micrograms TCDD/kg on PND 1, and mothers and litters were subsequently euthanized on PND 7, 13, 19, or 26. Both hydronephrotic incidence and severity increased with time to euthanization following treatment on PND 1. Thus with the dosing regimen used in this study, recovery does not appear to occur between PNDs 7 and 26. Sex-related differences were observed, as the hydronephrotic response in males was generally greater than in females. In conclusion, the postnatal window of sensitivity during which TCDD can induce hydronephrosis is very narrow. Nonetheless, the hydronephrotic response induced during this early postnatal time is dramatic. Finally, PND 1 is the peak postnatal period of susceptibility for development of TCDD-induced hydronephrosis.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a major health burden. Its central feature of renal fibrosis is not well understood. By exome sequencing, we identified mutations in FAN1 as a cause of karyomegalic interstitial nephritis (KIN), a disorder that serves as a model for renal fibrosis. Renal histology in KIN is indistinguishable from that of nephronophthisis, except for the presence of karyomegaly. The FAN1 protein has nuclease activity and acts in DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair within the Fanconi anemia DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. We show that cells from individuals with FAN1 mutations have sensitivity to the ICL-inducing agent mitomycin C but do not exhibit chromosome breakage or cell cycle arrest after diepoxybutane treatment, unlike cells from individuals with Fanconi anemia. We complemented ICL sensitivity with wild-type FAN1 but not with cDNA having mutations found in individuals with KIN. Depletion of fan1 in zebrafish caused increased DDR, apoptosis and kidney cysts. Our findings implicate susceptibility to environmental genotoxins and inadequate DNA repair as novel mechanisms contributing to renal fibrosis and CKD.
The aldo-keto reductase (AKR) protein superfamily contains >190 members that fall into 16 families and are found in all phyla. These enzymes reduce carbonyl substrates such as: sugar aldehydes; keto-steroids, keto-prostaglandins, retinals, quinones, and lipid peroxidation by-products. Exceptions include the reduction of steroid double bonds catalyzed by AKR1D enzymes (5β-reductases); and the oxidation of proximate carcinogen trans-dihydrodiol polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; while the β-subunits of potassium gated ion channels (AKR6 family) control Kv channel opening. AKRs are usually 37kDa monomers, have an (α/β)8-barrel motif, display large loops at the back of the barrel which govern substrate specificity, and have a conserved cofactor binding domain. AKRs catalyze an ordered bi bi kinetic mechanism in which NAD(P)H cofactor binds first and leaves last. In enzymes that favor NADPH, the rate of release of NADP(+) is governed by a slow isomerization step which places an upper limit on kcat. AKRs retain a conserved catalytic tetrad consisting of Tyr55, Asp50, Lys84, and His117 (AKR1C9 numbering). There is conservation of the catalytic mechanism with short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) even though they show different protein folds. There are 15 human AKRs of these AKR1B1, AKR1C1-1C3, AKR1D1, and AKR1B10 have been implicated in diabetic complications, steroid hormone dependent malignancies, bile acid deficiency and defects in retinoic acid signaling, respectively. Inhibitor programs exist world-wide to target each of these enzymes to treat the aforementioned disorders. Inherited mutations in AKR1C and AKR1D1 enzymes are implicated in defects in the development of male genitalia and bile acid deficiency, respectively, and occur in evolutionarily conserved amino acids. The human AKRs have a large number of nsSNPs and splice variants, but in many instances functional genomics is lacking. AKRs and their variants are now poised to be interrogated using modern genomic and informatics approaches to determine their association with human health and disease.
A predisposition for thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections can be inherited in families in an autosomal dominant manner. Genome-wide linkage analysis of two large unrelated families with thoracic aortic disease followed by whole-exome sequencing of affected relatives identified causative mutations in TGFB2. These mutations-a frameshift mutation in exon 6 and a nonsense mutation in exon 4-segregated with disease with a combined logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 7.7. Sanger sequencing of 276 probands from families with inherited thoracic aortic disease identified 2 additional TGFB2 mutations. TGFB2 encodes transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2, and the mutations are predicted to cause haploinsufficiency for TGFB2; however, aortic tissue from cases paradoxically shows increased TGF-β2 expression and immunostaining. Thus, haploinsufficiency for TGFB2 predisposes to thoracic aortic disease, suggesting that the initial pathway driving disease is decreased cellular TGF-β2 levels leading to a secondary increase in TGF-β2 production in the diseased aorta.
To explore the relationship between leukotriene (LT) and exercise-induced asthma.
Twenty-two non-smoking asthmatic patients with a reproducible fall in FEV(1) after exercise by least 10% and 10 normal patients were enrolled. Urinary levels of leukotriene E4 were measured before and 2 hours after exercise. Twelve subjects received cysteinyl LT receptor antagonist Zafirlukast (Ancolate) 20 mg twice a day for three days. Standardized exercise challenge were performed after 72 hours. End points included (1) area under the percent fall in FEV(1) versus time curve (AUC 0-60 min), (2) time to recovery to within 5% of the pre-exercise baseline FEV(1) value, (3) and maximum percent fall in FEV(1) from pre-exercise baseline.
To exercise-induced aothma (EIA) group, urinary LTE4 in 2 hours after exercise were higher than that of in before exercise, P < 0.01. Urinary leukotriene E4 concentration before and 2 hours after exercise were higher than normal subjects. Zafirlukast can caused a significant reduction in AUC(0 - 60 min) (Aera under the FEV(1)-time curve for 0 to 60 minutes after exercise); caused a significant reduction in the maximum percent fall in FEV(1); and Zafirlukast resulted in a shorter time to recovery of FEV(1) to preexercise baseline.
There was an increase in urinary LTE4 during the 2 hours after exercise challenge; Zafirlukast can attenuate EIA. The results indicate that there is an important role of leukotriene in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced asthma.
Exome sequencing has become a powerful and effective strategy for the discovery of genes underlying Mendelian disorders. However, use of exome sequencing to identify variants associated with complex traits has been more challenging, partly because the sample sizes needed for adequate power may be very large. One strategy to increase efficiency is to sequence individuals who are at both ends of a phenotype distribution (those with extreme phenotypes). Because the frequency of alleles that contribute to the trait are enriched in one or both phenotype extremes, a modest sample size can potentially be used to identify novel candidate genes and/or alleles. As part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), we used an extreme phenotype study design to discover that variants in DCTN4, encoding a dynactin protein, are associated with time to first P. aeruginosa airway infection, chronic P. aeruginosa infection and mucoid P. aeruginosa in individuals with cystic fibrosis.
Advanced pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis. Gemcitabine (GEM) can improve the quality of life of pancreatic cancer patients. However, the efficacy of gemcitabine-based combination chemotherapy is uncertain. This study was to compare the efficacy of GEM-based combination therapy and GEM alone on advanced pancreatic cancer.
Clinical data of 40 patients with pathologically or clinically diagnosed advanced pancreatic cancer were analyzed. Of the 40 patients, 15 were treated with GEM (1,000 mg/m(2)) alone weekly for 7 weeks followed by a 2-week rest, then received cycles of 3-week administration with 1-week rest; 25 were treated with GEM (1,000 mg/m(2)) weekly for 2 weeks plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (425-600 mg/m(2)) as bolus at Day 1-5 or 120-hour infusion every 21 days, or cisplatin (DDP) (30-37.5 mg/m(2)) at Day 1-2 every 21 days, or oxaliplatin (85-130 mg/m(2)) at Day 1 every 21 days, or capecitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) twice a day at Day 1-14 every 21 days, respectively. The survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Median time to progression (mTTP), clinical benefit response (CBR), disease control rate, median overall survival (mOS) and toxicity were assessed according to World Health Organization criteria.
The rate of CBR was 56.0% in GEM-combination group and 46.7% in GEM alone group. There were no significant differences in disease control rate, mOS, CBR, and adverse events between the two groups (all P>0.05). However, for the patients with stage III-IV advanced pancreatic cancer, the disease control rate was higher in GEM-combination group than in GEM alone group (75.0% vs. 45.5%, P=0.13).
GEM-combination regimens and GEM alone have similar efficacy, and lead to similar clinical benefit response and mOS for the patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
A variety of side effects developed in children treated with neuroleptics for Tourette's disorder. Of 208 children, 34 manifested dose-related symptoms of dysphoria, nine experienced a worsening of symptoms of Tourette's disorder that was attributed to akathisia, five became hostile and aggressive, three developed "fog states" that disappeared with discontinuation of neuroleptics or treatment with primidone, and three experienced symptoms of tardive dyskinesia that resolved with time. This data base of neuroleptic-treated children with Tourette's disorder demonstrates a variety of subtle and underrecognized side effects that may not be as readily discernible in children receiving neuroleptics for a primary psychiatric disorder.
Docetaxel and cisplatin (DDP) are effective drugs for head and neck tumors. Stage II-III clinical trial of TP regimen (docetaxel combined DDP) for head and neck tumors has completed. This study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity of TP regimen and PF regimen [DDP combined 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)] in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), to provide a new chemotherapeutic regimen for NPC.
Twenty NPC patients treated in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University between Oct. 1, 2005 and Mar. 1, 2006 were subjected to study group (TP group). Twenty patients were chosen randomly from the 45 NPC patients treated with PF regimen between May 1, 2004 and Sep. 30, 2005 as control group (PF group). Both groups received concurrent radiotherapy. The efficacy and adverse events of the 2 groups were compared.
The mean number of chemotherapy cycles was significantly higher in TP group than in PF group (3.85 cycles vs. 2.75 cycles, P<0.001). After induction chemotherapy, in TP group, 18 achieved partial remission (PR) and 2 had stable disease (SD) for nasopharyngeal lesions, 7 achieved complete remission (CR), 11 achieved PR and 2 had SD for regional lymph nodes; in PF group, 17 achieved PR and 3 had SD for nasopharyngeal lesions, 2 achieved CR, 15 achieved PR and 1 had SD for regional lymph nodes. After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, all in TP group and 18 in PF group achieved CR for nasopharyngeal lesions, and 19 in TP group and 15 in PF group achieved CR for regional lymph nodes. There was no significant difference in efficacy between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The occurrence rates of grade 3-4 neutropenia were significantly higher in TP group than in PF group (40.5% vs. 0% after induction chemotherapy, 40.5% vs. 10.2% after concurrent radiochemotherapy, P<0.05). The occurrence rates of anemia and thrombocytopenia were significantly lower in TP group than in PF group (P<0.05). The uses of antibiotics and parenteral nutritional support in the 2 groups were similar.
The efficacy of TP regimen on NPC is similar to that of PF regimen, and the adverse events are tolerable, but the long-term outcomes and toxicities need to be further investigated.
A case of myxoedema coma is reported where the administration of chlorpromazine resulted in a prolonged dystonic reaction. A similar challenge with a butyrophenone when the patient was on thyroxine caused a similar but much abbreviated response.
Guanfacine (Estulic, Tenex), a centrally acting antihypertensive, was investigated for its effects on the heart using isolated cardiac preparations and in patients for antiarrhythmic properties. The tachycardic effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation in spontaneously beating atria were concentration-dependently suppressed by guanfacine. A 50% inhibition was observed in atria from Syrian hamsters, guinea-pigs and rabbits with 1, 5.4 and 20 nmol/l, respectively. In guinea-pig atria the concentration-response curve of guanfacine was shifted to the right in a parallel manner by rauwolscine (pA2 8.58) but was not displaced by prazosine 1 mumol/l. In rabbit right papillary muscles guanfacine 1 to 10 mumol/l increased force of contraction by 13 to 91%. The positive inotropic effect was antagonized by prazosine 1 mumol/l but was not influenced by cimetidine 1 mumol/l or rauwolscine 1 mumol/l. It is concluded that guanfacine activates cardiac postsynaptic a1- and neuronal presynaptic a2-adrenoceptors with a preference to the latter of about 2 orders of magnitude. Direct membrane stabilizing effects in guinea-pig atria were negligible. In 4 patients with coronary heart disease associated with arrhythmia guanfacine 1 mg per day during 10 days decreased ventricular premature contractions, couplets and abolished appearance of ventricular tachycardias. These preliminary clinical results indicate that guanfacine may reduce cardiac risk factors.
The antifungal drug terbinafine has infrequently been incriminated in the occurrence of acute liver injury. We report a case of prolonged cholestasis that occurred in a 75-year-old woman, following terbinafine administration. Jaundice followed by pruritus appeared after four weeks of therapy and was associated with mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic liver tests abnormalities. Following drug withdrawal, serum bilirubin returned to normal values within three months, but anicteric cholestasis persisted for over six months. A liver biopsy performed after six months showed centrilobular cholestasis, discrete portal fibrosis, and a reduction in the number of interlobular biliary ducts. Terbinafine should be added to the list of drugs that can cause reduction in interlobular bile ducts.
We have previously reported that among the other death proteins, hepatic secretory phospholipase A₂ (sPLA₂) is a leading mediator of progression of liver injury initiated by CCl₄ in rats. The aim of our present study was to test the hypothesis that increased hepatic sPLA₂ released after acetaminophen (APAP) challenge mediates progression of liver injury in wild type (WT) and COX-2 knockout (KO) mice. COX-2 WT and KO mice were administered a normally non lethal dose (400 mg/kg) of acetaminophen. The COX-2 KO mice suffered 60% mortality compared to 100% survival of the WT mice, suggesting higher susceptibility of COX-2 KO mice to sPLA₂-mediated progression of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Liver injury was significantly higher at later time points in the KO mice compared to the WT mice indicating that the abatement of progression of injury requires the presence of COX-2. This difference in hepatotoxicity was not due to increased bioactivation of acetaminophen as indicated by unchanged cyp2E1 protein and covalently bound ¹⁴C-APAP in the livers of KO mice. Hepatic sPLA₂ activity and plasma TNF-α were significantly higher after APAP administration in the KO mice. This was accompanied by a corresponding fall in hepatic PGE₂ and lower compensatory liver regeneration and repair (³H-thymidine incorporation) in the KO mice. These results suggest that hindered compensatory tissue repair and poor resolution of inflammation for want of beneficial prostaglandins render the liver very vulnerable to sPLA₂-mediated progression of liver injury. These findings are consistent with the destructive role of sPLA₂ in the progression and expansion of tissue injury as a result of continued hydrolytic breakdown of plasma membrane phospholipids of perinecrotic hepatocytes unless mitigated by sufficient co-induction of COX-2.
A patient developed cholestatic jaundice following therapy with co-trimoxazole. Inadvertent re-challenge with the drug resulted in further clinical and biochemical deterioration, but complete recovery ensued on stopping this drug.
We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57-year-old woman with severe chloroquine-induced myopathy. Since 1989, she had been suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with renal involvement and undergone periods of treatment with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. Additional therapy with chloroquine (CQ) was started because of arthralgia. At the same time, slightly increased creatine kinase (CK) levels were noted. Myositis was suspected, and the patient was treated with steroids. The CK increase persisted, however, and she developed progressive muscular weakness and muscular atrophy. Routine controls revealed markedly elevated CK levels of 1,700 U/l. The neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of myositis. Thus, muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude polymyositis or toxic myopathy. As it revealed chloroquine-induced myopathy, medication was stopped. Discriminating between primary SLE-induced affection of the musculoskeletal system and drug-induced side effects is important for appropriate treatment of SLE patients.
Fenvalerate, a widely used synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, has been associated with poor semen quality in human being. However, little is known about the effects of lactational fenvalerate exposure on testicular development and spermatogenesis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of maternal fenvalerate exposure during lactation on testicular development and spermatogenesis in male offspring. Maternal mice were administered with fenvalerate (60 mg/kg) by gavage daily from postnatal day (PND) 0 to PND21. Lactational fenvalerate exposure markedly decreased the absolute and relative weights of testes and increased the number of apoptotic cells in testes of pups at weaning. Histological examinations showed abnormal seminiferous tubules with large vacuoles or complete spermatogenic failure in testes of fenvalerate-treated mice at weaning. Additional experiment showed that lactational fenvalerate exposure markedly reduced mRNA and protein levels of testicular P450scc, a testosterone (T) synthesis enzyme. Consistent with down-regulation of testicular P450scc, the level of serum and testicular T at weaning was significantly decreased in pups whose mothers were exposed to fenvalerate during lactation. Although the expression of testicular P450scc and serum and testicular T in adulthood restored to control level, the decreased weight of testes and histological changes were irreversible. Importantly, the percentage of mature seminiferous tubules (stages VII and VIII) and the number of spermatozoa were obviously decreased in adult male mice whose mothers were exposed to fenvalerate during lactation. Taken together, these results suggest that lactational fenvalerate exposure permanently impairs testicular development and spermatogenesis.
The impact of the strain on the metabolite profile of plasma samples in rats dosed with 2500 ppm 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA acid) or 45 mg/kg bw/day 4-chloro-3-nitroaniline (4C3N) for 4 weeks was evaluated. Four different strains were used: two Wistar strains (Crl:WI(Han), Han:RCC:WIST(SPF)), one Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD) and one Fisher strain (F-344/Crl). The metabolite profiles in the plasma were measured by LC-MS and GC-MS. The profound changes of the metabolite values induced by the MCPA acid treatment outweighed slight deviations caused by physiological variations between the different rat strains. The metabolome changes of the MCPA acid in all strains could be related to toxicological "mode of action" patterns (peroxisome proliferator, renal organic anionic transporter inhibition) with Crl:WI(Han) rats as reference strain. 4C3N administration led to extravascular hemolytic anemia with a small number of metabolome changes, which were strain dependent. The metabolome pattern associated with "hemolytic anemia" established with the reference strain (Crl:Wi(Han)) was not sufficiently similar in other strains. Thus, comparable metabolome profiles were obtained in different rat strains for a compound inducing profound metabolite changes. For a compound with a weak profile the results were more variable and appeared to be strain dependent.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease with a 10-year survival of <20%. We have previously shown that the combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel acts synergistically to induce apoptosis of myeloma cells in vitro. Based on these preclinical studies and phase I-II clinical trials in patients with solid tumors, we initiated a phase II clinical trial of paclitaxel 150 mg/m(2) IV over 3 h followed by gemcitabine 3000 mg/m(2) IV over 30-60 min in patients with relapsed or refractory MM. This regimen was administered every two weeks for a total of six cycles. Twelve patients enrolled, 3 discontinued treatment after 1 or 2 cycles because of severe neutropenia. As a result the protocol was modified to reduce the starting dose of gemcitabine to 2,000 mg/m(2). This resulted in tolerable hematological and mild non-hematological toxicities in the rest of the patients. One patient died before the onset of treatment. Of the 8 remaining patients treated with a reduced dose of gemcitabine, 1 achieved a durable CR, 3 had PR, 1 had minor response (MR), 1 had stable disease and 2 had progressive disease. The CR patient had a 98% reduction in the M-protein, beta2-microglobulin and plasma cells. His CR continued for more than 6 months. The 3 PR patients had a >50% reduction in the M-protein and >40% reduction in beta2-microglobulin. Bone marrow plasma cells were reduced by >50% in these patients. Treatment with the combination of paclitaxel and gemcitabine is an active and well-tolerated regimen in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
It is essential to recognize individual susceptibility to neuroleptic-induced side effects for treatment guidelines. This paper reports on a 6.9-year-old autistic male who developed repeated episodes of acute dystonic reactions associated with pimozide administration at the doses of 0.096 mg/kg/day and 0.032 mg/kg/day and 32 hours following pimozide withdrawal, as well as during subsequent thioridazine administration. It draws the clinician's attention to unusual susceptibility to extrapyramidal side effects and suggests that if a child shows this type of susceptibility to one neuroleptic, he/she may react similarly to other neuroleptics as well.
Tizanidine, an alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist with myospasmolytic action, is indicated for the treatment of back pain either as monotherapy or in combination with nonsteridal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Tizanidine (0.25-1.0 mg/kg) significantly produced analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in acetic acid induced writhing in mice and carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats, respectively. The effects were comparable with clonidine (0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg), another alpha2-agonist. Yohimbine (1 mg/kg), alpha2-adrenergic antagonist reversed the effect of tizanidine. Tizanidine (0.25 mg/kg) and clonidine (0.25 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs (nimesulide, meloxicam and naproxen). Tizanidine (1 mg/kg) did not alter basal pH, acidity (free and total) of gastric content and did not produce any mucosal injury in fasted rats. Tizanidine (1 mg/kg) significantly reduced meloxicam (UD50 3.21 mg/kg), nimesulide (UD50 24.52 mg/kg) and naproxen (UD50 14.10 mg/kg)-induced ulcerogenic effect (ulcer index, pH and free/total acidity). It is expected that tizanidine exerted gastrotprotection through stimulation of gastric and central alpha2-adrenergic receptors. Present investigation suggested that tizanidine not only enhance the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs but also improved gatstrointestinal tolerability of NSAIDs through modulation of central alpha-2-receptors. From this study, it can be speculated that tizanidine and NSAID combination therapy would prove to be a novel approach to treat nociceptive/inflammatory conditions with improved gastric tolerability of NSAIDs.
Overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Owing to their ability to permeate through biological membranes, excess NO and H(2)O(2) may be present in the media surrounding motor neurones. Anti-oxidative defence enzymes (ADEs) in erythrocytes are capable of detoxifying reactive oxygen species (produced endogenously or exogenously), but may also be structurally modified and inactivated by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Both balanced and coordinated ADE activities are of utmost importance for their correct physiological function.
We determined activity of the following ADEs: copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GR) in erythrocytes from sporadic ALS patients [SALS (-/+)], familial ALS patients with the Leu144Phe mutation in the SOD1 gene [FALS (+/+)], asymptomatic carriers with the Leu144Phe mutation in the SOD1 gene (+/-), and control subjects (-/-). We also examined the in vitro effect of diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) on CuZn SOD activity in erythrocytes from FALS patients, SALS patients and control subjects.
The influence of the Leu144Phe mutation and/or disease was apparent for ADE activities measured in all three patient groups. The SOD1 gene mutation decreased CuZn SOD and GSH-Px activity (two-way ANOVA, significant mutation effect). We noted that the disease also contributed to decreased CuZn SOD activity in SALS patients in comparison with the control group (two-way ANOVA, mutation and disease effect). The disease also influenced CAT and GR activity. CAT activity was decreased in both SALS and FALS patients. In all three patient groups, GR activity was higher than in the control group. Finally, DDC inhibited CuZn SOD activity in erythrocytes from control subjects, FALS (Leu144Phe) patients and SALS patients; however, its effect was more pronounced and significant in FALS patients.
Changes in erythrocyte ADE activities suggest that oxidative stress, involved in the motor neurone pathogenesis of SALS and FALS, also has systemic effects. Differences in ADE systems between the study groups revealed the presence of different types of oxidative pressure, indicating the potential additional benefit of individually designed anti-oxidant cocktail therapies.
In order to predict the short-term-outcome of schizophrenics under the treatment of haloperidol, changes of 15 schizophrenic subjects' EEG after 4 mg haloperidol oral intake were monitored with the method of QPEEG. The result of discriminate analysis showed that the more similar to typical EEG pattern of neuroleptics the patients showed, the better the patients responded to haloperidol treatment. Meanwhile, the haloperidol therapeutic mechanisms of brain electro-physiology and the electro-physiological characteristics of schizophrenics were also discussed.
Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH; OMIM144400), a risk factor for coronary heart disease, is characterized by an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that is associated with mutations in the genes LDLR (encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor) or APOB (encoding apolipoprotein B). We mapped a third locus associated with ADH, HCHOLA3 at 1p32, and now report two mutations in the gene PCSK9 (encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) that cause ADH. PCSK9 encodes NARC-1 (neural apoptosis regulated convertase), a newly identified human subtilase that is highly expressed in the liver and contributes to cholesterol homeostasis.
