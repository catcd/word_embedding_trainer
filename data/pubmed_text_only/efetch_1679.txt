The efficacy of ME1036, a novel parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of vancomycin by using a rabbit model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis. Compared with vancomycin, ME1036 reduced the bacterial counts in the vegetations at a lower dosage or over a shorter period of administration when it was used for the treatment of MRSA endocarditis.
We have examined the use of presurgical morphine-midazolam combination in 80 children aged 2-10 y undergoing repair of hypospadias. They were allocated randomly, in a double-blind study, to receive one of four morphine-midazolam combination doses (n = 20 each); (group I: 75 microg/kg each) [corrected] (group II: 75 microg/kg [corrected] morphine, 50 microg/kg [corrected] midazolam); (group III: 50 microg/kg [corrected] morphine, 75 microg/kg [corrected] midazolam); (group IV: 50 microg/kg [corrected] each). Drugs were given after induction of anesthesia and before the start of surgery. Observational scoring system, using crying, movement, agitation, posture and localization of pain as scoring criteria, was used to assess the children during their stay in the recovery room together with their sedative and/or analgesic requirement. Pre-surgical morphine-midazolam administration produced stable hemodynamic variables with satisfactory postoperative analgesia suggesting 75 microg/kg [corrected] dose of both morphine and midazolam as upper permissible dose, and 50 microg/kg [corrected] each as lower effective dose.
A low-dose sustained-release (SR) formulation of the thiazide-type diuretic indapamide, indapamide SR (Natrilix SR), retains the antihypertensive activity of the immediate-release (IR) formulation, with a smoother pharmacokinetic profile. In well controlled 12- to 52-week clinical trials, indapamide SR 1.5 mg/day was well tolerated and reduced blood pressure as effectively as therapeutic dosages of amlodipine, candesartan, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide or indapamide IR. Indapamide SR was also more effective than enalapril in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and similar reductions in renal end-organ damage, assessed by microalbuminuria, were seen with indapamide SR- and enalapril-based antihypertensive strategies. Indapamide SR provides an effective option for initial antihypertensive monotherapy and a basis for multidrug antihypertensive strategies.
Although randomized trials of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have shown increased cardiovascular risk, studies of nonselective, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen have been inconsistent.
We examined the influence of NSAIDs and acetaminophen on the risk of major cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal and fatal stroke) in a prospective cohort of 70,971 women, aged 44 to 69 years at baseline, free of known cardiovascular disease or cancer, who provided medication data biennially since 1990. During 12 years of follow-up, we confirmed 2041 major cardiovascular events. Women who reported occasional (1 to 21 d/mo) use of NSAIDs or acetaminophen did not experience a significant increase in the risk of cardiovascular events. However, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, women who frequently (> or =22 d/mo) used NSAIDs had a relative risk (RR) for a cardiovascular event of 1.44 (95% CI, 1.27 to 1.65) compared with nonusers, whereas those who frequently consumed acetaminophen had a RR of 1.35 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.59). The elevated risk associated with frequent NSAID use was particularly evident among current smokers (RR=1.82; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.42) and was absent among never smokers (Pinteraction=0.02). Moreover, we observed significant dose-response relations: Compared with nonusers, the RRs for a cardiovascular event among women who used > or =15 tablets per week were 1.86 (95% CI, 1.27 to 2.73) for NSAIDs and 1.68 (95% CI, 1.10 to 2.58) for acetaminophen.
Use of NSAIDs or acetaminophen at high frequency or dose is associated with a significantly increased risk for major cardiovascular events, although more moderate use did not confer substantial risk.
Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis syndrome of unknown etiology that mainly affects small and medium-size arteries, particularly the coronary artery. Coronary artery lesions may develop into aneurismal formation and thrombotic occlusion, and progress to ischemic heart disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of steroid pulse therapy following intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) treatment on the regression rate of aneurysms in Kawasaki disease. Among 93 sequential patients referred to us, because of coronary artery lesions in the acute phase, we found 23 aneurysms in 12 patients during the period from January 1997 to January 2008. We divided them into two groups: a non-steroid group, 7 patients (13 aneurysms) treated with single or multiple IVIG but no steroid pulse therapy; and a steroid group, 5 patients (10 aneurysms) treated with multiple IVIG followed by steroid pulse therapy. We compared the regression rate of the aneurysms between the two groups, retrospectively. The regression rates of the aneurysms in the steroid group were significantly higher than those in the non-steroid group when we analyzed 1) all aneurysms (p = 0.007), 2) giant aneurysms (aneurismal diameter was 4 or more x normal, or > 8 mm) (p = 0.018), and 3) aneurysms in IVIG-resistant patients who were resistant to initial IVIG therapy (p = 0.035). All aneurysms, including the giant aneurysms in the steroid group, regressed, and the regression rate of the aneurysms in the non-steroid group was about 46%(6/13). Steroid pulse therapy may be beneficial for IVIG-resistant patients. Our data suggest that steroid pulse therapy may lead to regression of aneurysms.
Scutellaria baicalensis is a widely used Chinese herbal medicine historically used in antiinflammatory and anticancer therapy. The goals of the study were to 1) determine its in vitro and in vivo anti-prostate cancer activity, 2) investigate its molecular mechanism directed at cell proliferation control including cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cyclins/cdks pathways, and 3) compare it with those of PC-SPES (PC stands for prostate cancer and spes is Latin for hope), a former herbal mixture for prostate cancer treatment of which S. baicalensis is a major constituent. Two human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, androgen dependent, and PC-3, androgen independent) were assessed for growth inhibition. S. baicalensis exerted dose- and time-dependent increased growth inhibition in both cell lines. However, the PC-3 cells IC50 (50% growth inhibition concentration) were slightly more sensitive than LNCaP cells (IC50=0.15 mg/ml), although the former is androgen independent. S. baicalensis was more effective in inhibition of cell growth compared with PC-SPES (IC50=0.38 mg/ml for PC-3 cells). Significant reduction of PGE2 synthesis in both cells after treatment with S. baicalensis resulted from direct inhibition of COX-2 activity rather than COX-2 protein suppression. S. baicalensis also inhibited prostate-specific antigen production in LNCaP cells. Finally, S. baicalensis suppressed expression of cyclin D1 in LNCaP cells, resulting in a G1 phase arrest, while inhibiting cdk1 expression and kinase activity in PC-3 cells, ultimately leading to a G2/M cell cycle arrest. Animal studies showed a 50% reduction in tumor volume after a 7-wk treatment period. This study demonstrated that S. baicalensis may be a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of prostate cancer.
A case of an elderly man who developed severe hyponatremia and bone marrow granulomatosis while taking methyldopa is described. The hyponatremia was found to be due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Bone marrow biopsy revealed granulomas. A MEDLINE search of the English literature was done, yielding only one previous report of methyldopa-induced bone marrow granulomatosis and no previous reports of methyldopa-induced SIADH.
Among currently prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sulindac (SLD) is associated with the greatest incidence of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans. Previously, an animal model of SLD-induced idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity was developed by cotreating rats with a nonhepatotoxic dose of LPS. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) was found to be critically important to the pathogenesis. In this study, the mechanism of liver injury induced by SLD/LPS cotreatment was further explored. Protein carbonyls, products of oxidative stress, were elevated in liver mitochondria of SLD/LPS-cotreated rats. The results of analyzing gene expression in livers of rats before the onset of liver injury indicated that genes associated with oxidative stress were selectively regulated by SLD/LPS cotreatment. Antioxidant treatment with either ebselen or dimethyl sulfoxide attenuated SLD/LPS-induced liver injury. The role of oxidative stress was further investigated in vitro. SLD sulfide, the toxic metabolite of SLD, enhanced TNF-induced cytotoxicity and caspase 3/7 activity in HepG2 cells. SLD sulfide also increased dichlorofluorescein fluorescence, suggesting generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hydrogen peroxide and TNF cotreatment of HepG2 cells caused greater cytotoxicity than either treatment alone. Either antioxidant tempol or a pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK decreased cell death as well as caspase 3/7 activity induced by SLD sulfide/TNF coexposure. These results indicate that SLD/LPS treatment causes oxidative stress in livers of rats and suggest that ROS are important in SLD/LPS-induced liver injury in vivo. Furthermore, ROS contribute to the cytotoxic interaction of SLD and TNF by activating caspase 3/7.
Hepatic energy depletion has been described in severe sepsis, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to cause mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. To clarify the mechanisms of LPS-induced mtDNA damage and mitochondrial alterations, we treated wild-type (WT) or transgenic manganese superoxide dismutase-overerexpressing (MnSOD(+++)) mice with a single dose of LPS (5 mg/kg). In WT mice, LPS increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species formation, hepatic inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA and protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and high-mobility group protein B1 concentrations. Six to 48 h after LPS administration (5 mg/kg), liver mtDNA levels, respiratory complex I activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents were decreased. In addition, LPS increased interferon-β concentration and decreased mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) mRNA, Tfam protein, and mtDNA-encoded mRNAs. Morphological studies showed mild hepatic inflammation. The LPS (5 mg/kg)-induced mtDNA depletion, complex I inactivation, ATP depletion, and alanine aminotransferase increase were prevented in MnSOD(+++) mice or in WT mice cotreated with 1400W (a NOS inhibitor), (2-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl-4-ylamino)-2-oxoethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride, monohydrate (a superoxide scavenger) or uric acid (a peroxynitrite scavenger). The MnSOD overexpression delayed death in mice challenged by a higher, lethal dose of LPS (25 mg/kg). In conclusion, LPS administration damages mtDNA and alters mitochondrial function. The protective effects of MnSOD, NOS inhibitors, and superoxide or peroxynitrite scavengers point out a role of the superoxide anion reacting with NO to form mtDNA- and protein-damaging peroxynitrite. In addition to the acute damage caused by reactive species, decreased levels of mitochondrial transcripts contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction.
To examine the differential properties of mucous glycoproteins, we produced hyperplastic and metaplastic changes in goblet cells of rat nasal epithelium by intranasal instillation of ovalbumin (OVA) in OVA-sensitized rats, and by intranasal lipopolysaccharides (LPS) instillation. The epithelial mucosubstance was quantitatively examined by AB-PAS and lectin histochemistry. The newly produced mucin after OVA challenge or LPS instillation contained a high amount of sulfomucin and a low amount of neutral glycoprotein: LPS-induced mucin contained more sulfomucin (70.1% of total) and less neutral glycoprotein (8.6%) than OVA-induced mucin (sulfomucin 33.6%, neutral glycoprotein 41.8%). Four of the lectins, PNA, MAL II, SNA, UEA I, stained some of the mucosubstance, indicating the presence of galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine, α2,3-linked and α2,6-linked sialic acid-galactose, and fucose residues. After LPS instillation, the reactivity was higher for galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine (64.8% of total) and α2,3-linked sialic acid-galactose (75.8%) than after saline instillation (3.5 and 19.1%, respectively) or OVA challenge (5.8 and 32.3%). A 2-fold increase in mucin mRNA (rat Muc5ac) expression was induced after LPS instillation or OVA challenge. These results indicate that mucin mRNA expression increases similarly after LPS instillation or OVA challenge, however, carbohydrate compositions of newly produced mucin are different between the two groups.
The in vivo formation of the sulfate ester of glycolithocholate is a critical step in the elimination of this hepatotoxic bile salt. Rhesus monkeys fed chenodeoxycholate or ursodeoxycholate, the precursors of lithocholate, develop frank cirrhosis in association with accumulation of nonsulfated glycolithocholate in bile. An enzyme catalyzing the formation of glycolithocholate-3-sulfate has been isolated from hepatic cytosol of adult female rhesus monkeys and has been purified 146-fold. When reduced it appears as a 30 kD band on an SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel. It has a pH optimum of 7.0 and is stimulated by low concentrations of Mg2+ (up to 2 mM), but does not have an absolute requirement for this metal ion. The kinetics of this enzyme have been investigated to ascertain whether its reaction mechanism can account for the poor in vivo rate of glycolithocholate sulfation. Inhibitor studies with an oxidized metabolite of lithocholate, 3-keto-5 beta-cholanoate, showed that the latter is a competitive inhibitor of glycolithocholate and is noncompetitive with the active form of sulfate, 3'phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate. The monophosphonucleotide 3'-AMP is a competitive inhibitor of 3'phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, and is noncompetitive with glycolithocholate. These observations are consistent with a sequentially ordered Bi Bi reaction mechanism in which the bile salt is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme. Such a reaction mechanism for bile salt:3'phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate:sulfotransferase would be, therefore, the first time in which the sulfate acceptor (the bile salt) is the initial substrate to bind to a sulfotransferase. These studies have shown that although rhesus monkeys have a liver enzyme capable of forming the sulfate ester of glycolithocholate, its reaction mechanism and the potent inhibition caused by simple metabolites, such as 3-keto-5 beta-cholanoate, may serve to under-express the activity of the enzyme in vivo.
Animal but few human studies have demonstrated gender-influenced differences in outcome related to prenatal cocaine exposure. Pregnant participants in a prospective pregnancy study were interviewed for drug use. Exposure was considered positive if history or laboratory tests were positive. An ordinal measure of exposure was also constructed. Six years later, the child and primary caretaker were tested to assess drug use in the home since birth and teacher-assessed child behavior. Data were complete for 473 children (204 cocaine exposed). Twenty-four of the exposed children (12%) were considered to have persistent pregnancy exposure based on positive urine screen at delivery. Boys with any prenatal cocaine exposure scored significantly higher (more problem behaviors) than nonexposed boys on the hyperactivity item. In contrast, no similar cocaine effect was observed for girls. When cocaine exposure was expressed as the three-level ordinal variable, boys, but not girls, with persistent exposure had more behavior problems (0.5 to 1.0 SD higher). Even after control for important covariates, boys with persistent exposure had more problems in central processing, motor skills, handling abstract concepts, and passivity to the environment. The magnitude of the relations reported in this research were moderate to large. In summary, both gender and the level of exposure had a significant behavioral effect on school-age behavior. In these analyses, the behavior of boys, but not girls, prenatally exposed to cocaine was significantly and negatively affected, and these findings remained after control for covariates, including prenatal alcohol or other illicit drug exposures and postnatal drug use in the home.
The influence of drugs, which alter the brain catecholaminergic functions, on the development of morphine tolerance was studied. The experiments were carried out on mice in locomotor activity test, and on rats in catalepsy test. Tolerance to morphine was induced by subcutaneous implantation of morphine-base (37.5 mg) pellets. Amphetamine insignificantly diminished the development of tolerance to cataleptogenic effects of morphine in rats but markedly inhibited the development of tolerance to morphine-induced hyperactivity in mice. The latter action of amphetamine was blocked by pimozide. Administration of nomifensine induced the inhibition of the development of morphine tolerance in both tests. Pimozide also abolished this antagonistic action of nomifensine in locomotor activity test in mice. The obtained results have shown that intensification of dopaminergic neurotransmission induced the diminution of the development of tolerance to morphine.
The case of a six-year-old girl suffering from severe cochleo-vestibular dysfunction following a series of chloroquine phosphate injections is presented in this paper. Prompt institution of therapy with steroids and vaso-dilators has helped to restore the hearing to a serviceable (socially acceptable) level. A surmise is made about the pathogenesis of chloroquine ototoxicity and how prompt appropriate therapy may be able to reverse the process. A plea is made for early referral of these cases so that prompt attention may be paid to them.
Silibinin, a flavanone from milk thistle, inhibits the growth of tumors in several rodent models. We examined the effects of dietary silibinin on the growth, progression, and angiogenesis of urethane-induced lung tumors in mice.
A/J mice (15 per group) were injected with urethane (1 mg/g body weight) or saline alone and fed normal diets for 2 weeks, after which they were fed diets containing different doses of silibinin (0%-1% [wt/wt] silibinin) for 18 or 27 weeks. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were used to examine angiogenesis and enzymatic markers of inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Urethane-injected mice exposed to silibinin had statistically significantly lower lung tumor multiplicities than urethane-injected mice fed the control diet lacking silibinin (i.e., control mice). Mice that received urethane and 1% (wt/wt) dietary silibinin for 18 weeks had 93% fewer large (i.e., 1.5-2.5-mm-diameter) lung tumors than control mice (mean number of tumors/mouse: 27 in the urethane group versus 2 in the urethane + 1% silibinin group, difference = 25 tumors/mouse, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 13 to 37 tumors/mouse, P = .005). Lung tumors of silibinin-fed mice had 41%-74% fewer cells positive for the cell proliferation markers proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin D1 than lung tumors of control mice. Tumor microvessel density was reduced by up to 89% with silibinin treatment (e.g., 56 microvessels/400x field in tumors from control mice versus 6 microvessels/400x field in tumors from urethane + 1% silibinin-treated mice [difference = 50 microvessels/400x field, 95% CI = 46 to 54 microvessels/400x field; P<.001]). Silibinin decreased lung tumor expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, two enzymes that promote lung tumor growth and progression by inducing VEGF expression.
Silibinin inhibits lung tumor angiogenesis in an animal model and merits investigation as a chemopreventive agent for suppressing lung cancer progression.
The effects of varying dosages of 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) in combination with cyclic dietary administration of ethinyl estradiol (EE) on induction of prostate carcinoma were investigated in male F344 rats. Animals received repeated treatment with 0.75 ppm of EE for 3 wk with intervals of 2 wk on basal diet. The cycle was repeated 10, 5, and 3 times in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, a single s.c. injection of DMAB being given 2 days after each change to basal diet at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight in Group 1, 100 mg/kg of body weight in Group 2, and 167 mg/kg of body weight in Group 3. With this dosing schedule, the total dose of DMAB (500 mg/kg of body weight) per rat was the same in each group. Subsequent to the last treatment with EE, all rats were given basal diet until the end of the experiment (Wk 60) when all surviving animals were sacrificed for histological examination. Carcinoma of the prostate was found in 58.6, 45.0, and 25.9% of rats surviving for 60 wk in Groups 1 to 3, respectively, the incidences of atypical hyperplasia being 86.2, 85.0, and 74.1%. However, tumors of the small and large intestines, preputial gland, and pancreas developed in a dosage-dependent manner, the largest incidences being found in the group given 167 mg of carcinogen 3 times. Thus the present experiment confirmed that administration of DMAB combined with cyclic treatment with EE induces a high incidence of prostate carcinoma in rats and demonstrated that a low dosage of DMAB given over a long period is superior to a high dosage over a short period for specific induction of prostate lesions.
Following the demonstration of an anti-tremor effect of ethosuximide in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkey model, we have tested the effect of this drug in 10 patients with typical parkinsonian tremor. Six patients suffered from Parkinson's disease with prominent, relatively drug-resistant rest tremor. The other four patients had a drug-induced parkinsonian tremor due to neuroleptic agents taken for a psychiatric condition. Five of the six parkinsonian patients and three of the four psychiatric patients reported within a few days a marked and intolerable exacerbation of their tremor. One patient in each group was improved, and this improvement was verified in repeated examinations. Thus, for unknown reasons, the effect of ethosuximide was not as predicted by the monkey model. Among possible explanations is the fact that we had chosen patients with drug-resistant tremor.
Antibiotic-induced hypokalemia does not occur frequently, but has been described with aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, and ureido penicillins. A patient with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia who developed severe hypokalemia while on high doses of oxacillin is presented. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of oxacillin-associated hypokalemia.
Based on the hypothesis that low-threshold calcium conductance in the thalamus might be involved in the pathophysiology of parkinsonian tremor, ethosuximide was given chronically to a monkey previously treated with MPTP and displaying exceptionally a typical rest tremor. After 5 days of daily treatment, the tremor was reduced by 60%. Diltiazem and verapamil which act on different calcium channels had no such effect. Ethosuximide also potentiated the anti-tremor effect of the dopamine D2 agonist LY-171555.
The pharmacological activities of YM-16151-1, a combined calcium entry blocking and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent, and its optical isomers were investigated on the cardiovascular system of dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. YM-16151-1 (0.1-1 mg/kg, i.v.) dose-dependently increased coronary arterial blood flow and decreased mean blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, heart rate and dp/dtmax with almost no effect on cardiac output. S-(-)- and R-(+)-isomers (0.1-1 mg/kg, i.v.) resembled YM-16151-1 in increasing coronary arterial blood flow and decreasing mean blood pressure and total peripheral resistance and were almost equipotent with YM-16151-1 in these effects. However, these optical isomers differed from YM-16151-1 in the changes in heart rate, dp/dtmax and cardiac output. The rank order of potency for these cardiac effects was S-(-)-YM-16151-1 > YM-16151-1 > R-(+)-YM-16151-1. In vagotomized dogs, YM-16151-1 inhibited the isoproterenol (0.2 microgram/kg, i.v.)-induced tachycardia with an ED50 value of 0.11 mg/kg, i.v. S-(-)- and R-(+)-isomers also inhibited the isoproterenol-induced tachycardia with ED50 values of 0.039 and 0.39 mg/kg, i.v., respectively. Thus, the difference in cardiac effects obtained from the anesthetized dog study among these compounds may be caused by the potency difference of their beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activities. In addition, R-(+)-isomer, possessing a less potent beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity than S-(-)-isomer, only produced a dose-dependent tachycardia at the hypotensive doses in conscious dogs. The present results demonstrate that YM-16151-1 behaves as a hybrid compound combining calcium entry blocking and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activities, and also demonstrate that YM-16151-1 is a racemic mixture with equal proportions of the two optical isomers, and, as such, the overall activity may be due to the sum of the activities of the individual optical isomers.
One hundred and sixteen patients with advanced and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were randomized to treatment with combined Streptozotocin and 5-fluorouracil or combined Streptozotocin and cyclophosphamide. Toxic reactions to each regimen were qualitatively similar and consisted of nausea and vomiting during the time of treatment and subsequent leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Renal toxicity was less frequent and only rarely severe. Among 51 eligible and evaluable patients treated with the Streptozotocin-cyclophosphamide combination, 12% showed objective response and among 42 patients treated with Streptozotocin + 5-fluorouracil, 12% showed objective response. The Streptozotocin + 5-fluorouracil-treated patients showed a slight advantage in survival. Neither regimen can be considered of substantive value to the patient with advanced pancreatic carcinoma.
Two patients with Parkinson's disease presented with unprovoked, abrupt onset of hallucinations, confusion and the simultaneous worsening of parkinsonian symptoms. This clinical syndrome appears to be a rare complication of dopaminergic therapy since improvement occurred gradually with reduction of Sinemet dosage.
In a prospective study of 41 acutely psychotic patients, neuroleptic-induced dystonic reactions occurred in 62.5% of the manic patients (10 of 16) and 66.7% of the schizophrenic patients (10 of 15), a nonsignificant difference. These findings contradict a recent report suggesting a higher risk for this side effect in mania.
Although many patients undergoing general anesthesia and surgery are pretreated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, hemodynamic interactions of beta-blockers and volatile anesthetics have so far only been studied in animals. We therefore designed a clinical study to evaluate the relationship between the extent of preoperative beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the hemodynamic effects of isoflurane anesthesia. Sixty-one patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and normal global left ventricular function scheduled for elective myocardial revascularization were studied immediately prior to surgery. One group of patients (n = 39) had been treated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents for at least 3 weeks up to and including the day of surgery. The degree of clinical beta-adrenoceptor blockade was quantified using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. The dose of isoproterenol required to increase heart rate by 25 beats/min was defined as the chronotropic dose 25 (CD25), representing the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Hemodynamic data were collected before and during isoflurane anesthesia (0.5%-0.6% end-tidal) plus 50% nitrous oxide. Twenty-two patients without preoperative beta-blocker therapy served as a control group. Preanesthetic values of cardiac index (CI), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were lower in patients pretreated with beta-blocking drugs, but statistically these differences were not significant when compared to data obtained in unblocked patients. Isoflurane anesthesia caused significant reductions of CI and arterial blood pressure. However, there were no significant differences in the absolute values or the percentage changes compared to baseline data obtained in awake patients between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
This study was undertaken to clarify the mechanism of orthostatic hypotension, one of the side effects frequently encountered after administration of levodopa (L-dopa). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was measured concomitantly with blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and calf blood flow (calf BF). The responses of these variables to head-up tilting (HUT) were analyzed before and after intravenous administration of L-dopa (50 mg) in eight healthy subjects. L-dopa induced significant increases in MSNA, with concomitant decreases in BP and no changes in calf BF in the supine position. At each angle of HUT, both MSNA and the calf BF increased, following administration of L-dopa. The pattern of MSNA changes was dissociated from that of the calf BF under the influence of L-dopa. These results suggest that peripheral, rather than central, mechanisms are involved in L-dopa-induced orthostatic hypotension.
Numerous methods have been used to minimize the cardiotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX), and most have had limited success. Chronic endurance exercise has been shown to protect against DOX cardiotoxicity, but little is known regarding the effects of acute exercise on DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction.
The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a single bout of acute endurance exercise on the cardiac dysfunction associated with DOX treatment.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats either performed an acute exercise bout on a motorized treadmill for 60 minutes at a maximal speed of 25 m/min with a 5% grade (EX) or remained sedentary (SED) 24 hours before receiving either a 15-mg/kg DOX bolus dose or saline (SAL). Cardiac function was then analyzed 5 days post injection using a Langendorff isolated perfused heart model. In addition, myocardial lipid peroxidation was analyzed as an indicator of oxidative stress.
Doxorubicin treatment alone (SED+DOX) promoted a significant decline in end-systolic pressure (-35%), left ventricular developed pressure (-59%), and the maximal rate of left ventricular pressure development (-43%) as well as a 45% increase in lipid peroxidation products when compared with SED+SAL (P<.05). Acute exercise 24 hours before DOX treatment, however, had a cardioprotective effect, as end-systolic pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, and the maximal rate of left ventricular pressure development were significantly higher in EX+DOX compared with SED+DOX (P<.05) and EX+DOX had similar levels of lipid peroxidation products as SED+SAL CONCLUSIONS: An acute exercise bout performed 24 hours before DOX treatment protected against cardiac dysfunction, and this exercise-induced cardioprotection may partly be explained by a reduction in the generation of reactive oxygen species.
To investigate the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and the reducing urinary protein efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in patients with primary chronic glomerulonephritis in Han nationality of southern Sichuan province.
Ninety-nine primary glomerulonephritis patients with urinary protein were enrolled in this study. They were treated with benazepril for at least 3 months. The ACE gene insertion/deletion(I/D) polymorphisms in intron 16 were determined by PCR. A comparison of the reducing urinary protein efficacy of benazepril was made between the patients with different ACE genotypes.
Urinary protein excretion was significantly higher in patients with ACE DD genotype than that in patients with II genotype. After benazepril treatment for 3 months, the rates of urinary protein decline were observed. The rates of reduction of proteinuria in patients with DD genotype and ID genotype were obviously higher than that in patients with II genotype(P<0.05).
Benazepril could decline the rate of urinary protein excretion in patients with primary chronic glomerulonephritis, and significant relationship was observed between ACE gene polymorphism and the reducing urinary protein efficacy of ACEI.
Ocular toxicity of long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment was assessed by regular ophthalmologic examinations in 99 patients. No patient developed significant loss of vision or visual field constriction to a white test object. Three patients had evidence of toxicity, but the medication had to be permanently discontinued in only one who subsequently had regression of all abnormalities except visual field constriction to a red test object. Neither duration of treatment nor the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus predisposed patients to toxicity.
