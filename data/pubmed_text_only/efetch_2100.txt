In China, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection was high because of perinatal and early childhood transmission. A three-dose hepatitis B vaccine schedule with a first dose as soon as possible after birth was introduced in 1992 and generalized in 2002 in the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI). In 2006, a serological survey evaluated the effectiveness of vaccination.
We conducted a restricted analysis of the national serological survey that sampled children and collected information on demographic characteristics, birth history, hepatitis B vaccination and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status as determined by ELISA testing. We compared children who received the first dose in a timely way (i.e., within 24h of birth) with others in terms of HBsAg status, stratified by birth cohort and place of birth.
Three-dose hepatitis B vaccine coverage increased from 60.8% for children born in 1992-1997 to 93.2% for children born in 2002-2005. Meanwhile, timely birth dose coverage increased from 38.7% to 74.4%. Among 29,410 children born in 1992-2005 who had received three vaccine doses and no hepatitis B immune globulin, factors associated with being HBsAg-negative in multivariate analysis included receiving a timely birth dose (p=0.04), birth after 1998 (p<0.001), living in an urban setting (p=0.008) and hospital birth (p=0.001). The relative prevalence of HBsAg among children receiving the timely birth dose was lower for children born in county or larger hospitals (0.39), intermediate in township hospitals (0.73) and highest at home (0.87).
Hospital birth and receiving a timely birth dose are the main determinants of the field effectiveness of the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Efforts to increase the proportion of hospital deliveries are key to increasing timely birth dose coverage and its effectiveness.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNA molecules involved in modulation of cellular sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. miRNA-21 (miR-21), one of the most prominent miRNAs in the genesis and progression of many human cancers, has been rarely characterized in myelogenous leukemia. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) was successfully used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) etc. However, cytotoxicity or insensitivity is a major concern in the successful treatment of leukemia. Here, we used a specific precursor miRNA-21 (pre-miR-21) or anti-miRNA-21 oligonucleotide (AMO-miR-21) to study sensitivity of HL60 and K562 cells to ATO. Cell viability and cell cycle were evaluated by MTT assay and PI assay using flow cytometry, respectively. Levels of miR-21 and its target PDCD4 were quantified by real-time PCR and/or western blot. AMO-miR-21 or ATO alone led to growth inhibition, apoptosis and G1 phase arrest of cell cycle. Apoptotic cells were confirmed morphologically with Hoechst staining. Moreover, there was somewhat synergistic effect of AMO-miR-21 and ATO in growth inhibition and apoptosis promotion. Meanwhile, enforced pre-miR-21 expression increased resistance to ATO, nevertheless not affecting cell growth alone. Dual-luciferase reporter vector containing two tandem PDCD4 3' UTR validated that PDCD4 was directly up-regulated by miR-21. Therefore, miRNA-21 by targeting PDCD4 may play a functional role in modulating ATO-induced cell death, and strategy using AMO-miR-21 and its combination with ATO may be useful as a myelogenous leukemia therapy.
This case describes a 34-year-old female who developed severe chorea following intravenous administration of ondansetron after elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. A course of benztropine led to a decrease in severity of the reaction which resolved on the fifth postoperative day. Ondansetron is believed to cause extrapyramidal reactions through actions on 5HT 3 receptors in the basal ganglia. Whereas isolated case reports of extrapyramidal reactions to ondansetron do exist, they have typically been associated with higher doses and have resolved within hours. We report the lengthiest extrapyramidal reaction to ondansetron yet described.
Intestinal mucosal ischemia with subsequent mucosal dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ongoing sepsis and multiple systems organ failure. We have previously reported vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion in the intestinal microcirculation during sepsis. Efforts to improve microcirculatory blood flow during sepsis may lead to more effective treatment or prevention of multiple systems organ failure. Pentoxifylline improves survival and visceral organ perfusion in experimental sepsis and hemorrhage. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pentoxifylline would improve microvascular blood flow in the small intestine during bacteremia.
In vivo videomicroscopy was used to quantitate alterations of the small-intestine microcirculation during Escherichia coli bacteremia in rats pretreated with either intravenous pentoxifylline or saline solution. Systemic hemodynamic and microvascular variables were measured every 15 minutes for 2 hours.
Tachycardia and increased cardiac output developed in bacteremic rats while they remained normotensive. Intestinal vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion occurred in bacteremic rats treated with saline solution. Microvessel diameters and blood flow remained within 5% to 10% of baseline in bacteremic rats pretreated with pentoxifylline. Pentoxifylline in nonbacteremic rats resulted in intestinal vasodilation and increased blood flow.
Pentoxifylline prevented small-intestine vasoconstriction and preserved microvascular blood flow during hyperdynamic sepsis. Pentoxifylline in nonbacteremic rats increased microvascular blood flow.
Chronic alcohol drinking accelerates liver fibrosis in patients with viral hepatitis that cannot be fully explained by ethanol-enhanced liver damage. Here, we identified a novel mechanism by which alcohol accelerates liver fibrosis: inhibition of the antifibrotic effects of natural killer (NK) cells and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).
Alcohol administration was achieved by feeding mice with a liquid diet containing 5% ethanol for 8 weeks. Liver fibrosis was induced by administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) for 2 weeks. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were also isolated and cultured for in vitro studies.
CCl(4) treatment induced greater fibrosis and less apoptosis of HSCs in ethanol-fed mice compared with pair-fed mice. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) or IFN-gamma treatment inhibited liver fibrosis in pair-fed but not in ethanol-fed mice. Poly I:C activation of NK cell cytotoxicity against HSCs was attenuated in ethanol-fed mice compared with pair-fed mice, which was due to reduced natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D), tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and IFN-gamma expression on NK cells from ethanol-fed mice. In vitro, HSCs from ethanol-fed mice were resistant to IFN-gamma-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis compared with pair-fed mice. Such resistance was due to diminished IFN-gamma activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in HSCs from ethanol-fed mice caused by the induction of suppressors of cytokine signaling proteins and the production of oxidative stress. Finally, HSCs from ethanol-fed mice were resistant to NK cell killing, which can be reversed by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) neutralizing antibody.
Chronic ethanol consumption attenuates the antifibrotic effects of NK/IFN-gamma/STAT1 in the liver, representing new and different therapeutic targets with which to treat alcoholic liver fibrosis.
Normal Sprague-Dawley rat mammary gland epithelial cells and mammary gland carcinomas induced by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4, 5-b]pyridine, a carcinogen found in the diet, were examined for the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). PPAR alpha mRNA and protein was detected in normal and tumor tissue by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. By quantitative RT-PCR, carcinomas had a 12-fold higher expression than control mammary glands, a statistically significant difference. PPAR alpha expression was examined in carcinomas and normal tissues from rats on high fat (23.5% corn oil) and low fat (5% corn oil) diets. Although neither carcinomas, nor control tissues showed statistically significant differences between the two diet groups, PPAR alpha expression was the highest in carcinomas from rats on the high fat diet. The expression of PPAR alpha in normal mammary gland and its significant elevation in mammary gland carcinomas raises the possibility of its involvement in mammary gland physiology and pathophysiology.
We evaluated sympathetic nervous system function in medication-free hyperactive children by measuring plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and then comparing the effects of two therapeutics doses of d-amphetamine to placebo in these patients. The medication-free hyperactive patients and controls had similar plasma NE levels and blood pressures while recumbent, and a similar increase in NE on standing, but the patients had a larger pressor response on standing. In the hyperactive patients d-amphetamine significantly increased blood pressure, pulse rate, and NE levels. The change in NE levels correlated with the change in amphetamine levels. The medication-free patients, when more anxious, had higher plasma NE levels.
Between 1990 and 1994, a series of prospective studies were conducted to optimize the treatment of multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria on the borders of Thailand. The tolerance of various treatment regimens containing either mefloquine 15 mg/kg (M15) or 25 mg/kg (M25) was evaluated in 3673 patients aged between 6 months and 88 years. Early vomiting (within 1 hour) is an important determinant of treatment outcome in these areas, despite re-administration of the dose. Overall, 7 % of the patients vomited within an hour. Significant risk factors were age < or = 6 years (relative risk (RR), 3.9) or > or 50 years (RR, 2.7), the higher mefloquine dose (M25) (RRm 2.7), vomiting < 24 hours before enrolment (RR, 2.5), axillary temperature > 38.0 degrees C (RR, 1.6), and parasitaemia > 10,000/microliter (RR, 1.3). In children < or = 2 years, 30% vomited with M25, and 13% did not tolerate a repeat dose. Vomiting was reduced 40% by splitting the higher dose (RR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8), and 50% by giving mefloquine on the second day in combination with artesunate (RR, 0.5; CI, 0.3-0.9). Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and sleeping disorders were 1.1-1.4 times more frequent with M25 than M15 in the three days following treatment, but were similar in the single or split-dose M25 groups, despite twofold higher mefloquine concentrations obtained with the latter. There was no evidence that diarrhoea, headache, and abdominal pain were associated with mefloquine use. High-dose mefloquine is well tolerated but should be given as a split dose.
The short-term safety of mangafodipir trisodium (MnDPDP) injection was studied in 546 adults with known or suspected focal liver lesions. An initial contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination was followed by unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), injection of MnDPDP (5 micromol/kg), and enhanced MRI. Adverse events were reported for 23% of the patients; most were mild to moderate in intensity, did not require treatment, and were not drug related. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea (7%) and headache (4%). The incidence of serious adverse events was low (nine events in six patients) and not drug related. Injection-associated discomfort was reported for 69% of the patients, and the most commonly reported discomforts included heat (49%) and flushing (33%). Changes in laboratory values and vital signs were generally transient, were not clinically significant, and did not require treatment. There were no clinically significant short-term risks from exposure to MnDPDP.
A prospective study of 20 patients presenting to an accident and emergency department with an exacerbation of pre-existing reversible airways disease was undertaken in order to determine whether such patients incurred any changes in their serum potassium following administration of 5 mg of nebulized salbutamol. Electrolytes were estimated before and 30 min after administration of nebulized salbutamol. No other drug was administered during this period. Results indicate that nebulized salbutamol can cause a significant hypokalaemic response in such situations. Eight out of the 20 patients studied demonstrated falls in serum potassium of more than 0.3 mmol/l. Most of the falls in serum potassium occurred in patients with low pre-treatment PCO2 values; a group of patients with less severe respiratory distress. This preliminary study indicates that a further study aimed at elucidating the clinical significance of nebulized salbutamol-induced hypokalaemia is required.
Patients living with human immunodeficiency virus represent a growing population, and an increased number of central nervous system presentations can be expected over the next decade. Emerging data suggests that both HIV-seropositive patients and cocaine-abusing patients may be at special risk of seizure phenomena. This case report discusses the risks of new-onset seizure activity when these two risk factors converge, which is a common occurrence in this population. Data from the fields of neuroanatomy and neurovirology are presented to explain the heightened risk of this patient population and provide the practitioner with an improved understanding of the central nervous system complexities in HIV.
The authors report the case of a neonate who presented since birth with refractory hypoxemia, peripheral edemas, ascites and pleural effusions. The mother had been given indomethacin for the 10 preceding days, in order to avoid premature labour. Echocardiography showed a tricuspid valve dysfunction with important regurgitation in the neonate. Under symptomatic treatment, clinical symptoms disappeared within 10 days. Echocardiography was normal by age 3 months. The responsibility of administration of indomethacin to the mother is discussed.
One month after taking carbamazepine for pain relief, a 13 year-old child with Friedrich's ataxia presented with an allergic rash and digestive and cardiac symptoms. Two weeks later, non-oliguric renal failure suggestive of interstitial nephritis was present. Acute renal failure resolved with pulse methyl prednisolone injections relayed with prednisone orally, for 2 months. Allergic manifestations with carbamazepine should lead to immediate withdrawal of treatment.
Hypertensive reactions occurred without obvious cause in two patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) while being monitored in a hospital. These patients appear to have experienced "spontaneous" hypertensive episodes temporally related to the ingestion of the MAOIs. Similar occurrences in outpatients reported in the literature are reviewed.
Curative up-front regimens for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas contain doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide, whereas salvage regimens generally contain non-cross-resistant agents. We hypothesized that up-front agents may be highly effective for salvage and developed an infusional regimen based on in vitro evidence of increased efficacy.
A prospective phase II study of etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin over 96 hours with bolus cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone (EPOCH) was performed in 131 patients with relapsed or resistant lymphoma.
Seventy-nine percent of patients had aggressive histologies, 46% were considered high risk by the International Prognostic Index, and 34% had resistant disease. Eighty-eight percent of patients had received at least four of the agents in EPOCH, and 94% had received doxorubicin. In 125 assessable patients, 29 (24%) achieved complete responses and 60 (50%) achieved partial responses. Among 42 patients with resistant disease, 57% responded, and in 28 patients with relapsed aggressive de novo lymphomas, 89% responded with 54% complete responses. With a median follow-up of 76 months, the overall and event-free survivals (EFS) were 17.5 and 7 months, respectively. In 33 patients with sensitive aggressive disease who did not receive stem-cell transplantation, EFS was 19% at 36 months. Toxicity was primarily hematologic, with an 18% incidence of febrile neutropenia. No clinically significant cardiac toxicity was observed, despite no maximum cumulative doxorubicin dose.
EPOCH is highly effective in patients who had previously received most/all of the same drugs and produces durable remissions in curable subtypes. Salvage regimens need not contain non-cross-resistant agents, and infusional schedules may partially reverse drug resistance and reduce toxicity.
Standard aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA])-dipyridamole therapy twice daily is associated with high rates of discontinuation in large part because of headache and gastrointestinal side effects. Attempts to address dipyridamole-induced headache through reduced dose initiation have produced variable results. Moreover, it has been suggested that migraineurs are more likely to have a dipyridamole-induced headache.
We sought to evaluate whether titrated initiation of ASA-dipyridamole in patients with stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) improves tolerance and to assess the appearance of headache in those with pre-existing history of headaches.
ASA-dipyridamole (25/200 mg) once daily together with ASA (81 mg) daily was started in 130 patients given the diagnosis of stroke/TIA with instructions to increase ASA-dipyridamole to twice daily after 7 days and discontinue ASA (81 mg). Patients received a telephone call on days 7 and 14 to assess for adverse events, discontinuation, and recurrent stroke/TIA.
Two patients were lost to follow-up. After 2 weeks, 113 patients were using the medication without any major complications. Fifteen patients were off therapy; 10 (8%) patients stopped because of headache and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas 4 patients were switched to other antiplatelet agents by their primary care physician as a matter of choice rather than ASA-dipyridamole side effects. One patient had recurrent stroke because of intracranial dissection and was switched to anticoagulation. Only 4 of 27 (14%) patients with a history of headache discontinued therapy.
Titrated initiation of ASA-dipyridamole (25/200 mg) appears to have low discontinuation rate and approximately 90% tolerance after 2 weeks. History of migraine or tension headaches was not directly associated with discontinuation because of headaches.
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction has been reported to be involved in vulnerability to alcohol and drug dependence in humans, possibly underlying both addictive behaviour and depression susceptibility. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible interactions between childhood adverse experiences, depressive symptoms and HPA axis function in addicted patients, in comparison with healthy control. Eighty-two abstinent heroin or cocaine dependent patients and 44 normal controls, matched for age and sex, completed the symptoms Check List-90 (SCL-90), measuring depressive symptoms, and the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire. Blood samples were collected to determine adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol basal plasma levels at 8:00 and 8:30 a.m. Addicted individuals showed significantly higher neglect and depression scores and ACTH-cortisol plasma levels respect to control subjects. Depression scores at SCL-90 in addicted patients positively correlated with plasma ACTH and cortisol values. In turn, plasma ACTH levels were directly associated with childhood neglect measures, reaching statistical significance with 'mother-neglect' scores. Plasma cortisol levels were related to 'father antipathy' among cocaine addicts. These findings suggest the possibility that childhood experience of neglect and poor parent-child attachment may have a persistent effect on HPA axis function as an adult, partially contributing, together with genetic factors and other environmental conditions, to both depressive traits and substance abuse neurobiological vulnerability.
A single oral pretreatment of rats with chlorfenvinphos (CVP) reduced toxicity of the same compound subsequently administered. This protection occurred 8 hr and became maximal 24 hr after the oral pretreatment at a dose of 15 mg/kg (about half of its LD50). The 24-hr pretreatment with CVP increased the LD50 of CVP threefold, but did not change the type of toxic signs and time to death caused by CVP. The CVP pretreatment did not appreciably change the toxicities of the cholinergic agonists, carbachol and oxotremorine, but significantly increased the toxicity of another organophosphate, dichlorvos. Oral treatment of rats with CVP (15 mg/kg) inhibited brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. This inhibition became maximal at 4 hr (about 20% of control) and lasted more than 24 hr after the administration. Twenty-four hours after oral administration of CVP (15 mg/kg), the second dose (CVP 30 mg/kg, po) was less effective in inhibiting cholinesterase activities of the brain, erythrocyte, and plasma compared with naive rats treated with the same dose. The difference in brain AChE activity between control and CVP pretreatment groups was greater in magnitude than that measured in erythrocytes. CVP concentration in plasma after the oral administration of CVP (30 mg/kg) was decreased by the CVP pretreatment. Area under the concentration vs time curve (AUC) in the CVP-pretreated group was about one-fourth of AUC in the control group. This decrease in the AUC was comparable to the decrease in the toxicity of CVP. Thus, the protection against subsequent CVP challenge may be due to the reduction in the inhibition of brain AChE activity caused by the decrease in plasma CVP concentration.
Metabolic status was assessed in 48 patients with nephrolithiasis followed-up for 4 years. Allopurinol and allomaron-treated patients were examined biochemically by 17 parameters of the blood and urine. The effects of the drugs were compared. It is concluded that in hyperuricemia up to 0.37 +/- 0.02 mmol/l allomaron is more effective (1--2 pills a day). In higher hyperuricemia allopurinol is preferable (4 pills a day). Allomaron can be also used (1--2 pills a day) under the control of urinalysis.
The effect of 2-phenylaminoadenosine (CV-1808) against myocardial ischemia was studied in anesthetized dogs. During intravenous infusion of CV-1808 (0.25 and 0.5 microgram/kg/min for 10 min) the ST-segment elevation in the epicardial ECG induced by a 5-min occlusion of a coronary arterial branch was occasionally enhanced in association with cardiac acceleration. In a dose of 0.5 microgram/kg/min, the agent inhibited the ST elevation 30 and 60 min after administration. The same dose did not change myocardial blood flow in the ischemic area despite significant systemic hypotension. In hearts with continuous coronary occlusion, CV-1808 (0.3 and 1.0 microgram/kg, i.v. bolus) increased the retrograde blood flow from the ischemic area immediately after administration, suggesting a collateral vasodilating action. Nifedipine (0.5 and 2.5 microgram/kg/min, i.v. for 10 min) and nitroglycerin (0.5 and 5.0 microgram/kg/min, i.v. for 10 min) had no influence on the ischemic ST-segment elevation, while a significant inhibition was seen with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.). A moderate hypotension was induced by CV-1808, nifedipine, and nitroglycerin, while a significant reduction in cardiac function was seen after dosing with propranolol.
A 14-year-old girl presented with hallucinations and bizarre behaviour 3 days following the institution of cimetidine therapy for acute gastritis. She had no history of drug abuse or psychiatric disorders, and physical examination and laboratory investigations yielded no abnormalities. Within 24 hours after cimetidine therapy was discontinued her behaviour returned to normal and the hallucinations stopped.
To report a case of a patient with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and multiple thromboses who developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and subsequent international normalized ratio (INR) prolongation possibly due to antiphospholipid antibodies.
A 56-year-old white woman with a history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and thrombosis taking chronic warfarin was admitted for gastrointestinal concerns and found to have an INR >14. Warfarin was discontinued, vitamin K was administered, and a heparin infusion was initiated. Over the next 2 days, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and progressive abdominal pain developed. Upon transfer to a tertiary care center, HIT was diagnosed, and a lepirudin infusion was initiated. Subsequently, a sudden elevation of the INR occurred (>14) with low prothrombin (factor II) activity. After INR values declined to 2-3, warfarin was reinitiated with dosing adjusted using factor X and II activity levels. Clotting factors II and X activities were measured to monitor long-term warfarin therapy, with no evidence of complications after 7 months.
Typically, the INR is used to assess the intensity of anticoagulation. The INR value represents the reduction of clotting factors II, VII, and X. In rare circumstances, an independent inhibitor or interfering substance can interfere with the process of measuring the INR. In such situations, an alternative approach can be direct measurement of clotting factor concentrations.
Factor II and/or factor X activity levels provided an alternative means for measuring the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in the presence of a significant inhibitor (antiphospholipid antibodies) that biased the INR measurements.
Understanding of mechanisms of cancer progression is very important for reduction of cancer mortality. Of six rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, differing in their metastatic potential to the lung after inoculation into the tail vein of nude mice, the most metastatic featured particular overexpression of glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2). Therefore, we analyzed the influence of interference in highly metastatic L2 cells by siRNA transfection. Gpx2 siRNA significantly inhibited cell proliferation at 24 and 48h time points with induction of apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest. High expression of mutated p53 was detected in all HCC cell lines, with reduction in Gpx2 siRNA-transfected cells. Migration and invasion in vitro were also suppressed as compared to control siRNA-transfected cells and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 was reduced. In vivo, the numbers and areas of metastatic nodules per area in the lungs were significantly reduced in the mice inoculated with Gpx2 siRNA-transfected cells as compared to control siRNA-transfected cells. In conclusion, expression of GPX2 is associated with cancer metastasis from rat HCCs both in vitro and in vivo. Together with immunohistochemical findings of elevated expression in rat and also human liver lesions, the results point to important roles in hepatocarcinogenesis.
A 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1.8-3.6 g of diltiazem, paracetamol, aspirin, isosorbide nitrate, and alcohol. He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids. Eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia, unrecordable blood pressure, and then became asystolic. He was resuscitated with high dose (13.5 g) intravenous calcium and adrenaline (epinephrine). He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours. This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose, particularly with the onset of asystole. It should be considered early in cases of cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose. The case also highlights the problems with delayed toxicity when whole bowel irrigation is not administered.
