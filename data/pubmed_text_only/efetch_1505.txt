Emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc is widely used to treat acute hepatitis possibly by antioxidative mechanisms. The present study was designed to investigate whether emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside exerted neuroprotective effects on the focal cerebral injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion in vivo and on the neuronal damage induced by glutamate in vitro, and to study the possible mechanisms. Male Wistar rats were used to establish the model of ischemia and reperfusion. The behavioral test was performed and the cerebral infarction area was assessed in the brain slices stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, total antioxidative capability and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the brain tissue were determined with spectrophotometrical methods to probe the primary mechanisms of emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside. In vitro, the neuroprotective effects of emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside were tested in the cultured cortical cells of fetal rats exposed to glutamate. Emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside concentration in plasma and brain tissue was also measured to examine distribution of emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside in the brain. The results showed that the treatment of rats with emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside reduced the neurological deficit score and the cerebral infarction area, increased SOD activity and total antioxidative capability, and decreased MDA level in the brain tissue in dose-dependent way. Emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside also inhibited the neuronal damage induced by glutamate. Besides, emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside was able to penetrate blood-brain barrier and distribute in the brain tissue. These findings demonstrate that emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside is able to provide neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia-reperfused injury and glutamate induced neuronal damage through exerting antioxidative effects and inhibiting glutamate neurotoxicity.
The associations between a polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR), dental mercury exposure, and self-reported symptoms were evaluated among 157 male dentists and 84 female dental assistants. Self-reported symptoms and detailed work histories were obtained by computerized questionnaire. Spot urine samples were collected and analyzed for mercury concentrations to evaluate recent exposures, whereas a chronic mercury exposure index was created from the work histories. 5-HTTLPR polymorphism status was determined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay. Scores for current, recent, and chronic self-reported symptom groups were evaluated with respect to recent and chronic mercury exposure and 5-HTTLPR polymorphism status. Multiple regression analysis controlled for age, socioeconomic status, tobacco and alcohol use, self-reported health problems, and medications. Analyses were restricted to Caucasian subjects due to the highly skewed distribution of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. Separate evaluations were conducted for dentists and dental assistants. In contrast to previous reports, no consistent associations were found between either urinary mercury concentration or the chronic index of mercury exposure and any category of symptoms. However, both significant and consistent associations were observed between increased symptoms and the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism involving two copies of the short or "s" allele (full mutation), but not with the polymorphism involving only one copy (heterozygous), demonstrating a gene-dose relationship for symptom reporting. These findings suggest that within this restricted population increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and memory are associated with the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism among both males and females.
Between January 1999 and December 2000, 125 patients in Lima, Peru were enrolled in individualized treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Hypokalemia was observed to be an important adverse effect encountered in this cohort.
To identify risk factors associated with the development and persistence of hypokalemia during MDR-TB therapy, and to review the incidence and management of hypokalemia in patients receiving MDR-TB therapy.
A retrospective case series of 125 patients who received individualized therapy for MDR-TB between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2000.
Among 115 patients who were screened for electrolyte abnormalities, 31.3% had hypokalemia, defined as a potassium level of < 3.5 mEq/L. Mean serum potassium at time of diagnosis was 2.85 mEq/L. Diagnosis of low serum potassium occurred, on average, after 5.1 months of individualized therapy. Multivariate analysis of risk factors for this adverse reaction identified two causes: administration of capreomycin, and low initial body weight. Normalization of potassium levels was achieved in 86% of patients.
Electrolyte disturbance was frequently encountered in our cohort of patients with MDR-TB. Successful screening and management of hypokalemia was facilitated by training the health-care team in the use of a standardized algorithm. Morbidity from hypokalemia can be significant; however, effective management of this side effect is possible without sacrificing MDR-TB treatment efficacy.
Myricetin-3-O-α-rhamnoside (myricitrin) is a naturally occurring phenolic compound which possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. The aim of this study was to determine the hepatoprotective effects of myricitrin. Myricitrin at doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg and silymarin at dose of 100mg/kg were administered to BALB/cN mice by oral gavage, once daily for two consecutive days following carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-intoxication. Myricitrin significantly ameliorated CCl4-induced increase in serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels and histopathological changes in the liver. Hepatic oxidative stress was reduced by myricitrin, as evidenced by the decrease in lipid peroxidation, with concomitant increase in glutathione (GSH) level and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) expression. In addition, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) overexpression in the liver was reduced, suggesting the suppression of inflammation. The expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was markedly ameliorated, indicating the inhibition of profibrotic response. Myricitrin also improved the regeneration of hepatic tissue after CCl4-intoxication, as evidenced by increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression. The results of the current study suggest that myricitrin exhibits a significant hepatoprotective activity. Myricitrin provided better hepatoprotection when compared to silymarin, which is consistent with its higher in vitro antioxidant potential.
Inflammation is a local tissue response to attacks characterized by vascular and cellular events, including intense oxidative stress. Riparin A, a compound obtained from Aniba riparia, has been shown to have antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity in vitro. This study was aimed at evaluating the anti-inflammatory effect of riparin A against acute inflammation. The results of our evaluations in various experimental models indicated that riparin A reduced paw edema induced by carrageenan, compound 48/80, histamine, and serotonin. Furthermore, it decreased leukocyte and neutrophil counts, myeloperoxidase activity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels, and cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β) levels increased by carrageenan-induced peritonitis, and reversed glutathione levels. Riparin A also reduced carrageenan-induced adhesion and rolling of leukocytes on epithelial cells and did not produce gastric-damage as compared with indomethacin. In conclusion, the data show that riparin A reduces inflammatory response by inhibiting vascular and cellular events, modulating neutrophil migration, inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production, and reducing oxidative stress.
To establish an immune complex induced rat liver fibrosis model by intraperitoneal injection of human serum albumin (HSA).
Male Wistar rats, weighting 110-120 g, were sensitized with HSA by subcutaneous injections at different sites for 4 shots at intervals of 14, 10 and 10 days. Ten days after the fourth injection, the peritoneal booster dose of HSA was administrated to rats twice weekly for 8 weeks with an initial dose of 5 mg, and progressive increase to 20 mg. Liver biopsy was performed at the beginning of HSA booster, 15, 30, 60 days after HSA booster, and 30, 60, 90, 120 days after discontinuation of HSA booster, respectively. Liver samples were examined for histological changes and liver hydroxyproline (HyP) was measured by biochemical method. Fibrosis serum markers hyaluronate acid (HA) and laminin (LN) were determined by RIA method.
After intraperitoneal administration of HSA, the degree of liver pathological changes, the liver Hyp content and serum HA and LN increased (P<0.05). The longer the HSA administrated, the higher the liver pathological change degree (P<0.05) and the levels of liver Hyp and serum HA (P<0.01). After discontinuation of HSA, the levels of serum HA and liver Hyp decreased significantly (P<0.01) but were still significantly higher than those in the controls (P<0.01). The liver fibrosis formation rate was 100% and the fibrosis lasted more than 120 days.
Intraperitoneal administration of HSA to make rat immune complex induced liver fibrosis model is convenient with high liver fibrosis formation rate and long fibrosis lasting time. The model may be used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of antifibrotic drugs.
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) is characterized by asymmetric arthritis of big and small joints, enthesitis, dactylitis, psoriatic skin lesions and nail pitting. Investigators agree that JPsA is a relatively common chronic arthropathy of childhood that differs clinically, serologically, and genetically from both juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile ankylosing spondylitis. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a multisystemic autosomal recessive disease occasionally accompanied by sacroiliitis. This is characterized by recurrent self-limited attacks of fever and accompanying abdominal, chest and arthricular pain. We present a 14-year-old Turkish girl with JPsA and carrying FMF gene mutations. In this patient, JPsA was diagnosed according to her physical, laboratory and skin biopsy findings and a treatment with methotrexate and sulfasalazine was started. As an inadequate clinical and laboratory response was obtained after the first month of therapy, the patient was investigated for FMF, and was diagnosed by molecular analyses of related gene (E148Q heterozygous/V726A homozygous mutation) besides clinical findings. After 2 weeks of the colchicine treatment, symptoms of the patient regressed and acute phase reactants decreased. To our knowledge, this is the first case presenting with psoriatic arthritis and FMF gene mutations together and responds to colchicine, methotrexate and sulfasalazine dramatically in clinical and laboratory findings. This case has been presented to remind that cases with psoriatic arthritis may also carry mutations in the MEFV gene.
CI-907 is a new orally active nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Monoester (prodrug) and diacid forms produced concentration related ACE inhibition in guinea-pig serum (IC50 for monoester, 1.7 X 10(-7) M and for diacid, 2.6 X 10(-9) M). In isolated rabbit aortic rings and in rat and dog autonomic studies, CI-907 is highly specific in suppressing the contractile or pressor responses to angiotensin I. In two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats, single daily doses (0.03-30 mg/kg p.o.) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure; 3 mg/kg lowered blood pressure to normotensive levels. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat, subacute administration of CI-907 (30 mg/kg/day for 5 days) produced the same decrease in blood pressure as that obtained in the renal hypertensive rat. In diuretic-pretreated renal hypertensive dogs, 10 mg/kg normalized blood pressure. For equivalent drops in blood pressure, heart rate increases were less in CI-907 than in enalapril-treated renal hypertensive dogs. No side effects were observed with CI-907 in any of the conscious animals. The antihypertensive response to CI-907 (0.03-1.0 mg/kg p.o.) was found to correlate with inhibition of vascular tissue ACE, but not plasma or brain ACE in two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats. These studies indicate that CI-907 is a potent antihypertensive agent with a heart rate profile different from enalapril.
The purpose of the study is to investigate the rate and degree of ocular-hypertensive response to topical steroids in Chinese children.
The study design was an institutional, randomized, clinical trial.
A total of 19 consecutive patients were studied.
Topical steroids were administered to Chinese children younger than 10 years of age who underwent bilateral strabismus surgery. One eye was randomized to receive topical 0.1% dexamethasone (DMS), whereas the fellow eye received 0.1% fluorometholone (FML) six times per day for up to 4 weeks. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured on the day before operation and at postoperative days 1, 3, 6, 10, 13, and 27, then every 2 weeks thereafter until the IOP fell to preoperative levels. Topical steroids would be stopped if IOP was 30.00 mmHg or greater.
Peak IOP and maximal change of IOP from baseline were measured and categorized into low, intermediate, and high levels. Time to peak IOP also was studied.
A total of 16 patients were included. The peak IOP for DMS-treated eyes was 30.66 +/- 8.35 mmHg (range, 13.00-48.00 mmHg), whereas that in FML-treated eyes was significantly lower at 20.66 +/- 6.03 mmHg (range, 11.30-36.30 mmHg) (P = 0.001). The maximal change in IOP ranged from -2.60 to +31.00 mmHg in DMS-treated eyes (mean, 15.48 +/- 8.71 mmHg), almost double that of FML-treated eyes (range, +1.00 to +17.00 mmHg; mean, 5.83 +/- 4.96 mmHg) (P = 0.001). When the ocular-hypertensive responses of both DMS and FML groups were categorized into three levels of severity, significant differences were found between the two treatment groups (P = 0.001). In the DMS group, nine patients (56.25%) were high responders and six patients (37.5%) were intermediate responders. In the FML group, only one patient (6.25%) was a high responder.
The ocular-hypertensive response to topical DMS in children occurs more frequently, more severely, and more rapidly than that reported in adults. A total of 56% of the studied children, all younger than 10 years of age, were high responders to topical DMS. Of these, 89% attained their peak IOP within 8 days. Its use in children should best be avoided if possible. It would be desirable to monitor the IOP when it is being used. Conversely, FML produced a much less ocular-hypertensive effect and therefore poses an acceptable risk of clinically significant pressure elevation.
Somatic mutations of the phosphatase and tensin (PTEN) gene have been frequently detected in many types of human cancer. However, germline mutations can determine multiple hamartoma syndromes and, as more recently ascertained, syndromes clinically characterized by autism associated with macrocephaly. To determine whether germline mutations of PTEN may lead to different phenotypes, we screened all the nine exons of the PTEN gene in 40 patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, with or without features of autism spectrum disorder, associated with macrocephaly. Three novel de novo missense mutations were found (p.H118P, p.Y176C, p.N276S) in two severely mentally retarded patients with autism and in a subject with neurodevelopmental disorders without autistic features. Our results provide evidence that PTEN germline mutations may sustain a more wide phenotypical spectrum than previously suggested.
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of flestolol, a new short-acting, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, were examined in nine healthy subjects after a constant intravenous infusion of 5 micrograms/kg/min for 72 hours. Flestolol blood levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. In all subjects, flestolol blood concentration attained steady state 30 minutes after initiation of infusion. The mean +/- standard deviation steady-state concentration of flestolol was 31.1 +/- 12.0 ng/mL. The elimination half-life averaged 7.2 minutes. The mean +/- standard deviation total body clearance was 181 +/- 66 mL/min/kg. The apparent volume of distribution and the area under the curve averaged 1.89 L/kg and 2.23 micrograms-hr/mL, respectively. Flestolol did not cause any significant change (P greater than .05) in the heart rate or systolic or diastolic blood pressure from the baseline. Flestolol significantly (P less than .05) attenuated the isoproterenol-induced increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure and decrease in diastolic blood pressure in comparison with baseline. The average maximum reduction in isoproterenol tachycardia was in the range of 63% to 79% during flestolol infusion. There was a rapid recovery from beta blockade after termination of flestolol infusion; the recovery averaged 96% 20 minutes after the infusion was stopped. We conclude that flestolol exhibits a very short half-life and is cleared mainly by extrahepatic routes. It is an effective beta blocker and possesses a short duration of action.
The discs large (Dlg) protein, or synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97), is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family of multidomain scaffolding proteins which recruits transmembrane and signaling molecules to localized plasma membrane sites. Murine dlg is the homologue of the Drosophila dlg tumor suppressor gene. The loss of dlg function in Drosophila disrupts cellular growth control, apicobasal polarity, and cell adhesion of imaginal disc epithelial cells, resulting in embryonic lethality. In this study, we isolated a mutational insertion in the murine dlg locus by gene trapping in totipotent embryonic stem cells. This insertion results in a truncated protein product that contains the N-terminal three PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1 domains of Dlg fused to the LacZ reporter and subsequently lacks the src homology 3 (SH3), protein 4.1 binding, and guanylate kinase (GUK)-like domains. The Dlg-LacZ fusion protein is expressed in epithelial, mesenchymal, neuronal, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells during embryogenesis. Mice homozygous for the dlg mutation exhibit growth retardation in utero, have hypoplasia of the premaxilla and mandible, have a cleft secondary palate, and die perinatally. Consistent with this phenotype, Dlg-LacZ is expressed in mesenchymal and epithelial cells throughout palatal development. Our genetic and phenotypic analysis of dlg mutant mice suggests that protein-protein interactions involving the SH3, protein 4.1 binding, and/or GUK-like domains are essential to the normal function of murine Dlg within craniofacial and palatal morphogenesis.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is the most serious of acute neurological side effects produced by antipsychotic medication, characterized by hyperthermia, rigidity, altered consciousness and autonomic dysfunction, the prevalence of which varies from 0.4-1.4%. NMS is usually seen in treatment with high potency typical antipsychotics and very rarely with atypical antipsychotics. However, NMS cases have been reported with risperidone, clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine. The presentations of NMS have often varied and we report another atypicality in presentation of NMS due to olanzapine use.
Gender and ethnicity are powerful predictors of initiation and maintenance of cigarette smoking in adults but less is known about their role in smoking in adolescents. Consistent with human studies, rat models also reveal sex and strain differences in response to nicotine administration.
This research examined nicotine withdrawal behaviors in 96 adolescent, male and female, Sprague Dawley (SD) and Long Evans (LE) rats. Rats received seven days continuous subcutaneous infusion of saline or 3.16 mg/kg nicotine via Alzet osmotic minipumps. Behavioral observations were made before, during, and after saline or nicotine administration. Occurrences of six specific behaviors were quantified: abnormal posture or movement, abnormal grooming, whole-body shakes, ptosis, empty-mouth chewing/teeth chattering, and diarrhea.
SD male and female rats that received nicotine displayed significantly more withdrawal behaviors 1 and 2 days after cessation of nicotine administration compared with rats that had received saline. LE male rats that received nicotine displayed significantly more withdrawal behaviors 1 day but not 2 days after cessation of nicotine administration compared with males that received saline. LE females showed no significant withdrawal behaviors after cessation of nicotine administration.
Results indicate that nicotine withdrawal in adolescent rats depends on sex and strain.
To investigate the expression and role of B-cell translocation gene 2(BTG2) in the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Modified Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced primary hepatocellular carcinoma rat model was established. The expression of BTG2, p53 and cyclinD1 was detected by RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry.
The BTG2 protein was predominantly localized in the nucleus, with faint cytoplasmic staining in normal liver cells; however, it is mainly a cytoplasmic protein in HCC cells. BTG2 was over-expressed during the early stage after DEN treatment, the expression level peaked at 5 weeks and then it gradually decreased to the normal level after 16 weeks. The expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E was increased gradually after DEN treatment, and peaked at 16 weeks and 5 weeks respectively. A significant increase in p53 was not observed until 5 weeks after DEN treatment, and it gradually decreased after 16 weeks.
Decreased expression of BTG2 may be an important step in carcinogenesis of HCC. BTG2 may positively regulate p53 expression and negatively regulate cyclin D1 expression in the carcinogenesis of HCC.
Two patients treated by chemotherapy for a non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma developed focal neurological symptoms including disorientation, hemoplegia, and cortical blindness 5 and 15 days after the end of a polychemotherapy course, including methotrexate and vindesine. In both patients ECG and blood pressure were normal. Case 1 had a slight increase of protein level without cells on CSF examination and presented with a paralytic ileus. Case 2 developed an inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (IADHS) syndrome. In both cases, noncontrast CT scans showed bilateral, symmetrical low density areas within the temporooccipital regions. Postcontrast CT images stressed major cortical and subcortical enhancement predominantly over the gray matter. In Case 2 the lesions also affected the right parietal lobe. Magnetic resonance scans 2-3 weeks after the onset of neurological symptoms demonstrated low intensity signal lesions on T1-weighted images and bright signal on T2-weighted images. In Case 1 the visual deficit failed to regress and in Case 2 the patient died 2 months later because of the natural evolution of her lymphoma. The clinical and radiological data suggested that a vascular ischemic process was responsible for the cerebral lesions in these two patients. As Vinca alkaloids and not methotrexate have been implicated as a cause of cortical blindness, and as our two patients presented signs of overdose of vindesine (paralytic ileus and IADHS), we suggest that the neurological and radiological abnormalities in our patients may have been due to neurotoxicity of vindesine.
A 57-year-old man with nodular rheumatoid arthritis was started on a combination of etanercept and methotrexate. After treatment for five months on this therapy, he presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation. While this report is anecdotal, any new drug warrants intense monitoring for unexpected toxicities in the post-marketing period. Etanercept is being tried in patients with congestive heart failure, where TNF-a seems to be increased. Further surveillance and caution are suggested in patients with known coronary artery disease or atrial dysrhythmia.
The mesenteric hyperemia induced by intraduodenal application of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is mediated in part by capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerves. Antagonist of capsaicin-sensitive receptors (capsazepine) and blocker of capsaicin-sensitive cation channels (ruthenium red) have been described. We employed these tools to dissect the mechanism of regulation of mesenteric hyperemia induced by intraduodenal administration of HCl. Subcutaneous 100 micromol/kg capsazepine or intraduodenal 0.1% ruthenium red was administered to pentobarbital anesthetized rats. Then, 2.5 ml/kg of 640 microM capsaicin or 0.1 N HCl was administered intraduodenally. The mesenteric hyperemic responses were recorded. The results demonstrated that in a dose that decreased the mesenteric hyperemia induced by intraduodenal capsaicin, capsazepine failed to attenuate the mesenteric vasodilatory effect of intraduodenal HCl. Ruthenium red significantly attenuated the mesenteric hyperemia after intraduodenal capsaicin and HCl. These in vivo data provide the first functional evidence for the existence of capsazepine-sensitive capsaicin receptors and cation channel complexes in the rat duodenal and intestinal mucosa. The capsaicin- and HCl-sensitive receptors are unlikely to be functionally identical in these locations. The ruthenium red-sensitive cation channels appear to mediate the capsaicin- and HCl-induced mesenteric hyperemia.
Polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (PVT) occur spontaneously in canine hearts under the combination of D-sotalol (S), bradycardia and phenylephrine (PE). We investigated the hypotheses that: (1) the activation patterns of the initial PVT beats would be consistent with an origin in the ventricular conduction system; and (2) the inhomogeneous prolongation of repolarisation intervals can provide refractory barriers for re-entrant activity.
Unipolar electrograms were recorded from 127 epicardial (EPI) sites with a sock electrode array as well as from intramural and endocardial sites during PVTs. Electrograms were analysed to generate isochronal maps and measure the spatial distribution of activation-recovery intervals (ARI).
Under S (9.9-14.5 mg.l-1), spontaneously terminating PVTs (cycle length of 270 +/- 43 ms, n = 45) (mean +/- s.d.) occurred when a PE bolus (10-50 micrograms.kg-1) was injected. The first beat of the PVTs occurred with a coupling interval of several hundred ms to the preceding idioventricular beat (IDV) without any bridging activity and its earliest EPI breakthrough occurred in areas overlying the terminations of the right or left bundle branch. ARI values measured in IDV (295 +/- 47 ms) were significantly prolonged prior to PVT (462 +/- 92 ms). Prolongation was greater in apical than in basal epicardial areas, and at endocardial than epicardial sites (to > 500 ms). Maximum delays > 200 ms developed in the regions of marked ARI prolongation and, in later beats, circus movement re-entry occurred around refractory barriers, shifting between various regions of the ventricles.
Thus, PVTs occurring spontaneously under conditions of delayed repolarisation originate from shifting sites in the ventricular conduction system and re-entrant activity shifting between various regions of the ventricle may occur in later beats of the more sustained arrhythmias.
Beryllium metal has physical properties that make its use essential for very specific applications, such as medical diagnostics, nuclear/fusion reactors and aerospace applications. Because of the widespread human exposure to beryllium metals and the discrepancy of the genotoxic results in the reported literature, detail assessments of the genetic damage of beryllium are warranted. Mice exposed to beryllium chloride at an oral dose of 23mg/kg for seven consecutive days exhibited a significant increase in the level of DNA-strand breaking and micronuclei formation as detected by a bone marrow standard comet assay and micronucleus test. Whereas slight beryllium chloride-induced oxidative DNA damage was detected following formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase digestion, digestion with endonuclease III resulted in considerable increases in oxidative DNA damage after the 11.5 and 23mg/kg/day treatment as detected by enzyme-modified comet assays. Increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine was also directly correlated with increased bone marrow micronuclei formation and DNA strand breaks, which further confirm the involvement of oxidative stress in the induction of bone marrow genetic damage after exposure to beryllium chloride. Gene expression analysis on the bone marrow cells from beryllium chloride-exposed mice showed significant alterations in genes associated with DNA damage repair. Therefore, beryllium chloride may cause genetic damage to bone marrow cells due to the oxidative stress and the induced unrepaired DNA damage is probably due to the down-regulation in the expression of DNA repair genes, which may lead to genotoxicity and eventually cause carcinogenicity.
Lung cancer has become the top killer among malignant tumors in China and is significantly associated with somatic genetic alterations. We performed exome sequencing of 14 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) with matched adjacent normal lung tissues extracted from Chinese patients. In addition to the lung cancer-related genes (TP53, EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, and ROS1), this study revealed "novel" genes not previously implicated in NSCLC. Especially, matrix-remodeling associated 5 was the second most frequently mutated gene in NSCLC (first is TP53). Subsequent Sanger sequencing of matrix-remodeling associated 5 in an additional sample set consisting of 52 paired tumor-normal DNA samples revealed that 15% of Chinese NSCLCs contained somatic mutations in matrix-remodeling associated 5. These findings, together with the results from pathway analysis, strongly indicate that altered extracellular matrix-remodeling may be involved in the etiology of NSCLC.
Amiodarone has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachyarrhythmias. The use of amiodarone has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects. A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given. It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment, including steatosis, alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver. Patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels. Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly.
The efficacy and safety of amlodipine, 10 mg, a new long-acting calcium antagonist, was compared with placebo in 103 patients with stable angina pectoris in a multicenter double-blind crossover study. The trial consisted of an initial 2-week single-blind placebo period followed by a first period of 4 weeks of double-blind therapy, which was followed by a 1 week washout period and then a second 4-week double-blind period after treatments were crossed over. Twenty-four-hour Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was carried out in 12 patients at three centers. In the first double-blind period amlodipine produced a significantly greater increase in symptom-limited exercise duration (amlodipine 478.5 to 520.6 vs placebo 484.6 to 485.2 seconds; change +8.8% vs +0.1%, respectively; p = 0.0004) and total work (amldipine 2426 to 2984 vs placebo 2505 to 2548 kilopondmeters; change +24% vs +1.7%, respectively; p = 0.0006) and a decrease in angina attack frequency (from 3 to 1 per week; p = 0.016) and nitroglycerin consumption (from 2 to 0.5 tablets/wk; p = 0.01) compared with placebo. Holter monitoring revealed significant reductions in numbers (amlodipine 4.65 to 2.22 vs placebo 1.84 to 1.54; change -52% vs +84%, respectively; p = 0.06), absolute total area (amlodipine 87.66 to 11.43 vs placebo 5.76 to 35.24; change -87% vs +513%, respectively; p = 0.02), and duration (amlodipine 12.29 to 2.95 vs 1.66 to 7.74 seconds; change -76% vs +367%, respectively; p = 0.008) of ST-segment depressions after treatment with amlodipine compared with placebo. After the treatments were crossed over changes continued to favor amlodipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Serum digoxin concentrations can mislead psychiatric consultants. Two patients with therapeutic digoxin concentrations were seen for neuropsychiatric disorders that cleared rapidly once digoxin was discontinued.
