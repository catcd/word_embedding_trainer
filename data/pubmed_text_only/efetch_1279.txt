The efficacy and safety of single oral doses of the leukotriene D4-receptor antagonist, ICI 204,219, were tested in subjects with acute seasonal allergic rhinitis. Subjects who were enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial spent 8 h/d for two consecutive days in a park at the peak of ragweed season (counts > 1,000 grains/m3). Subjects (n = 164) who had sufficient symptoms during a 3-h baseline period on Day 1 were randomized to treatment with 10 (n = 33), 20 (n = 33), 40 (n = 33), or 100 mg (n = 32) of ICI 204,219 or placebo (n = 33). Rhinitis symptoms (nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, throat and palate, and eye symptoms) were recorded hourly in the park and three times each evening at home. Blood samples were collected twice daily to determine plasma levels of ICI 204,219. Nasal congestion improved (p < 0.01) most consistently from the evening of Day 1 through Day 2 after treatment with 20- and 40-mg doses of ICI 204,219 versus placebo. Sneezing and rhinorrhea (p < or = 0.05) also improved on Day 2 for subjects who received 20- and 40-mg doses of ICI 204,219 compared with placebo. Mean symptoms scores for the entire day showed that 20 mg of ICI 204,219 was the minimally effective dose in this trial. The onset of action for all treatment groups, including placebo, was within the first 2 h of dosing. No serious adverse events were reported during the trial. ICI 204,219 was well tolerated and relieved symptoms of acute seasonal allergic rhinitis.
The morphological factors contributing to the reduction GFR in an early phase of NE-induced ARF (0.75 microgram/kg/min) were evaluated by comparing renal morphology at the end of NE infusion with that 2 hr later in unilaterally nephrectomized dogs. GFR 2 hr after NE infusion was reduced to 50% of the preinfusion level in a 30 min infusion group (N = 6), to 13% in a 60 min infusion group (N = 7), and to 2% in a 120 min infusin group (N = 5). On the other hand, simultaneous RBF was not significantly reduced in any group. Dilated PT lumina filled with eosinophilic granular materials in paraffin sections fixed in Zenker-Formol or with impacted swollen blebs in Epon sections fixed in diluted Karnovsky's solution and osmium were found diffusely immediately following 60 and 120 min NE infusion, but patchily after 30 min infusion. Similar changes were found 2 hr after the infusion, except that some PTs came to have dilated but transparent lumina in the 60 and 120 min NE infusion groups. Electron microscopic studies revealed that a part of the membrane-bounded cytoplasm of PT cells extruded into the tubular lumen and became impacted swollen blebs during NE-induced ischemia. There was no prominent foot process fusion in any group. It is concluded that the tubular obstruction by impacted swollen blebs generated in PT during ischemia is a major factor responsible for the reduction in GFR in the early phase of NE-induced ARF.
We describe a metabolic defect in bile acid synthesis involving a deficiency in 7alpha-hydroxylation due to a mutation in the gene for the microsomal oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase enzyme, active in the acidic pathway for bile acid synthesis. The defect, identified in a 10-wk-old boy presenting with severe cholestasis, cirrhosis, and liver synthetic failure, was established by fast atom bombardment ionization-mass spectrometry, which revealed elevated urinary bile acid excretion, a mass spectrum with intense ions at m/z 453 and m/z 510 corresponding to sulfate and glycosulfate conjugates of unsaturated monohydroxy-cholenoic acids, and an absence of primary bile acids. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the major products of hepatic synthesis to be 3beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic and 3beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acids, which accounted for 96% of the total serum bile acids. Levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol were > 4,500 times normal. The biochemical findings were consistent with a deficiency in 7alpha-hydroxylation, leading to the accumulation of hepatotoxic unsaturated monohydroxy bile acids. Hepatic microsomal oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity was undetectable in the patient. Gene analysis revealed a cytosine to thymidine transition mutation in exon 5 that converts an arginine codon at position 388 to a stop codon. The truncated protein was inactive when expressed in 293 cells. These findings indicate the quantitative importance of the acidic pathway in early life in humans and define a further inborn error in bile acid synthesis as a metabolic cause of severe cholestatic liver disease.
The effect of single-dose clonidine premedication on the vapour requirement for isoflurane-induced hypotension in patients undergoing middle ear or nasal surgery was evaluated in an open, controlled, randomized study. Inspired isoflurane concentration was regulated by a microcomputer-based, self-tuning control program when hypotension was required. Patients given clonidine 0.6 mg by mouth 2 h before operation required a mean inspired isoflurane concentration of 2.0% to induce hypotension (mean intra-arterial pressure 50 mm Hg) compared with 3.01% in the control group (P less than 0.05). Five out of 10 patients in the control group required a supplementary dose of labetalol 5 mg i.v. to achieve satisfactory hypotension, compared with one of 10 patients given clonidine premedication (Fisher's exact probability, 0.07). A mean concentration of 1.4% isoflurane was required to maintain hypotension in the clonidine group, compared with 2.3% in the control group (P less than 0.01). Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations did not increase during induced hypotension in each group.
Flavopiridol (HMR 1275) has been identified recently as a novel antineoplastic agent in the primary screen conducted by the Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute. Flavopiridol inhibits most cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and displays unique anticancer properties. Here, we investigated whether this compound was effective against head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Exposure of HNSCC cells to flavopiridol diminished cdc2 and cdk2 activity and potently inhibited cell proliferation (IC50 43-83 nM), which was concomitant with the appearance of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content. Moreover, DNA fragmentation and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling) reaction confirmed that flavopiridol induces apoptosis in all cell lines, even on certain HNSCC cells that are insensitive to apoptosis to DNA-damaging agents (gamma-irradiation and bleomycin). A tumorigenic HNSCC cell line was used to assess the effect of flavopiridol in vivo. Treatment (5 mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally) for 5 d led to the appearance of apoptotic cells in the tumor xenografts and caused a 60-70% reduction in tumor size, which was sustained over a period of 10 wk. Flavopiridol treatment also resulted in a remarkable reduction of cyclin D1 expression in HNSCC cells and tumor xenografts. Our data indicate that flavopiridol exerts antitumor activity in HNSCC, and thus it can be considered a suitable candidate drug for testing in the treatment of refractory carcinomas of the head and neck.
In this paper, the effects of three antipsychotic agents using the avian species laboratory model are described. d-Amphetamine (2-5 mg/kg, s.c.) dose-dependently antagonized catalepsy induced by haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.), YM-09151-2 (0.02-0.04 mg/kg, i.p.) and (-)-sulpiride (20-40 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats. (-)-Sulpiride (10-40 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently antagonized apomorphine (0.125 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced stereotyped behavior in young chicks. Similarly, YM-09151-2 (0.04 mg/kg, i.p.) antagonized apomorphine (0.125 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced stereotyped behavior in young chicks. (-)-Sulpiride (40 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly antagonized apomorphine (0.25 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced stereotyped behavior in 6 week old chicks. Parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 300 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the intensity of stereotyped behavior induced by apomorphine (0.125 mg/kg, s.c.) in young chicks. However, (-)-sulpiride (40 mg/kg, i.p.) did not significantly influence the effect of PCPA on apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior. Similarly, catalepsy induced by (-)-sulpiride (40 mg/kg, i.p.), haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) and YM-09151-2 (0.04 mg/kg, i.p.) in male rats was profoundly suppressed by PCPA (300 mg/kg, i.p.). The present results indicate that apomorphine-induced stereotyped pecking in young (4-6 day old) chicks may serve as a suitable laboratory model for testing potential antipsychotic drugs. In addition, the data indicates that endogenous 5-hydroxytryptamine mechanisms may be involved in the genesis of drug-induced catalepsy in rats.
Antiarrhythmic effects of a new beta 1 selective adrenoceptor blocker, betaxolol, were examined in comparison with those of atenolol using two canine ventricular arrhythmia models (adrenaline arrhythmia and digitalis arrhythmia). Both betaxolol and atenolol suppressed adrenaline arrhythmia, and the minimum effective plasma concentration of betaxolol for this arrhythmia model was determined to be less than 10 ng/ml. However, on digitalis arrhythmia, both beta blockers were ineffective, even though the high doses used in these experiments, 3 mg/kg for betaxolol and 5 mg/kg for atenolol, showed significant hypotensive effects. The present results suggest that betaxolol and atenolol may be expected to be clinically effective on arrhythmias related to increased sympathetic tone.
In this article the signs and symptoms as well as the course and complications are described of a feverish disease contracted by a fourteen year old boy after spending summer-holidays in the southern part of France. In retrospect this disease could be diagnosed as 'Mediterranean spotted fever' In the same period of these manifestations also a partial loss of sight at one eye occurred; although serology tests of antibody titers were negative, it was attributed to chorioretinitis due to activation of a congenital toxoplasmosis. The course was further complicated by an acute renal insufficiency during treatment of the chorioretinitis with high doses sulfadiazine. A short contemplation on the various clinical syndromes is presented.
The aim of the study was to examine the effects of taurine on hepatic fibrogenesis and in isolated hepatic stellate cells (HSC).
The rats of the hepatic damage (HD) group were administered carbon tetracholoride (CCl4) for 5 weeks and a subgroup received, in addition, a 2% taurine containing diet for 6 weeks (HDT). The HSC were isolated from normal rats and cultured for 4 days.
The hepatic taurine concentration was decreased in the HD group. This loss and the hepatic histological damage and fibrosis (particularly in the pericentral region), were reduced following taurine treatment. Furthermore, the hepatic alpha-SMA, lipid hydroperoxide and 8-OHdG levels in serum and liver, as well as hepatic TGF-beta1 mRNA and hydroxyproline levels were significantly increased in the HD group, and most of these parameters were significantly reduced following taurine treatment. In contrast to the MAP-kinase and Akt expressions, which remained unchanged, the lipid hydroperoxide and hydroxyproline concentrations, as well as TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced by taurine in activated HSC.
Oral taurine administration enhances hepatic taurine accumulation, reduces oxidative stress and prevents progression of hepatic fibrosis in CCl4-induced HD rats, as well as inhibits transformation of the HSC.
In H-2S mice, the administration of mercuric chloride results in the development of antinucleolar autoantibodies. These mice represent a valuable model to study the role of environmental factors in the development of systemic autoimmunity. We have obtained seven antinucleolar mAb from mercury-injected A.SW mice and characterized their specificities and V genes. All mAb immunoprecipitate the U3 and U8 ribonucleoprotein particles (RNP) and some (but not all) react with fibrillarin, the only currently characterized protein component of mammalian nucleolar RNP. Several VH and V kappa genes are recurrently used by these antinucleolar RNP mAb and their H chain CDR3 segments contain several acidic residues that may be important for binding to the cationic proteins composing the nucleolar RNP. Our results support the concept that in H-2S mice administration of mercury induces a specific loss of tolerance to nucleolar RNP.
It was previously observed that the nucleoside analog 5-azacytidine increased the spleen necrosis virus (SNV) mutation rate 13-fold in one cycle of retrovirus replication (V. K. Pathak and H. M. Temin, J. Virol. 66:3093-3100, 1992). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that nucleoside analogs used as antiviral drugs may also increase retrovirus mutation rates. We sought to determine if 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), the primary treatment for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, increases the retrovirus mutation rate. Two assays were used to determine the effects of AZT on retrovirus mutation rates. The strategy of the first assay involved measuring the in vivo rate of inactivation of the lacZ gene in one replication cycle of SNV- and murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vectors. We observed 7- and 10-fold increases in the SNV mutant frequency following treatment of target cells with 0.1 and 0.5 microM AZT, respectively. The murine leukemia virus mutant frequency increased two- and threefold following treatment of target cells with 0.5 and 1.0 microM AZT, respectively. The second assay used an SNV-based shuttle vector containing the lacZ alpha gene. Proviruses were recovered as plasmids in Escherichia coli, and the rate of inactivation of lacZ alpha was measured. The results indicated that treatment of target cells increased the overall mutation rate two- to threefold. DNA sequence analysis of mutant proviruses indicated that AZT increased both the deletion and substitution rates. These results suggest that AZT treatment of HIV-1 infection may increase the degree of viral variation and alter virus evolution or pathogenesis.
We report a case of bile duct hamartoma which developed in a patient who had been on long-term danazol treatment. Such patients should be under close follow-up, preferably with periodic ultrasound examination of the liver. If the patient develops a liver mass, because of non-specific clinical features and imaging appearances, biopsy may be the only way to achieve a definitive diagnosis.
Water balance studies were performed in 7 experimental dogs before and during a period of cortisol-induced polyuria and in one dog with spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism before and after removal of an adrenocortical carcinoma. Measurements of urine and plasma osmolality and plasma arginine vasopressin concentration were made at regular intervals during the water deprivation studies. The results indicate that cortisol does not block the release of vasopressin but interferes with its action in the kidney.
We report a case of acute transient encephalopathy with confusion, drowsiness, myoclonic jerks, periodic triphasic sharp wave EEG patterns induced by low doses of baclofen. We discuss the pathogenesis and the differential diagnosis from the subacute spongiform encephalopathy of sudden onset.
Guinea pigs were sensitized with 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI) by a repetitive application onto the bilateral nasal vestibules once a day for 5 consecutive days. When these animals were further treated with TDI for additional 9 weeks, a number of these animals exhibited external symptoms similar to those in human asthmatics, such as labored breathing characterized by prolonged expiration phases. Pathological examination of the lung of these animals clearly revealed contraction of bronchioles where hypertrophy of the smooth muscle and hypersecretion of mucin were evident. Furthermore, infiltration of numerous inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils, was observed in the peribronchial area. In these animals, the histamine-releasing activity of lung tissues was also demonstrated after challenge with TDI-guinea pig serum albumin conjugate. The histamine-releasing activity was found to be elevated to a maximum level during the first 2 weeks after sensitization and to remain at a constant level throughout the rest of the treatment period. Similar time courses were observed with respect to serum levels of TDI-specific antibodies, IgE and IgG. A survey of a series of 28 separate experiments using totally 565 animals indicated that the incidence of animals exhibiting an asthmatic response was 35% on average, ranging from 0 to 58.3%. Furthermore, the serum level of TDI-specific IgG, rather than that of TDI-specific IgE, was rather closely related to the incidence of asthmatic responses in TDI-treated guinea pigs.
d,l-Propranolol (1 and 5 mg/kg s.c.) did not cause a fall in blood pressure and induced only a limited decrease in heart rate in conscious spontaneously) hypertensive rats (SHR). In contrast, after bilateral adrenalectomy, d,l-propranolol induced a rapid and profound decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases in heart rate and blood pressure in the individual animals were not correlated. The effects were mainly caused by l-propranolol but an additional effect of d-propranolol cannot be excluded. The decrease in blood pressure was not observed after removal of the adrenal medulla. Heart rate decreased only slightly in these animals. After treatment of adrenalectomized SHR with corticosterone (1 mg/kg b.w./h) the decrease in blood pressure due to d,l-propranolol was completely abolished. The fall in heart rate was diminished. Central injection of d,l-propranolol into the lateral brain ventricle of adrenalectomized SHR caused cardiovascular changes which were less pronounced than those following peripheral injection of comparable doses. The inhibitory effects of d,l-propranolol also occurred in adrenalectomized normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats. However, no significant changes in blood pressure and only a limited fall in heart rate were observed in adrenalectomized normotensive and renal hypertensive Wistar rats. It is concluded that the presence of the adrenal cortex, but not of the adrenal medulla prevents acute hypotension and bradycardia after propranolol in the conscious SHR.
Resveratrol, a constituent of grapes and other food products, has been shown to prevent carcinogenesis in murine models. We report here that resveratrol induces apoptotic cell death in HL60 human leukemia cell line. Resveratrol-treated tumor cells exhibit a dose-dependent increase in externalization of inner membrane phosphatidylserine and in cellular content of subdiploid DNA, indicating loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry and DNA fragmentation. Resveratrol-induced cell death is mediated by intracellular caspases as observed by the dose-dependent increase in proteolytic cleavage of caspase substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the ability of caspase inhibitors to block resveratrol cytotoxicity. We also show that resveratrol treatment enhances CD95L expression on HL60 cells, as well as T47D breast carcinoma cells, and that resveratrol-mediated cell death is specifically CD95-signaling dependent. On the contrary, resveratrol treatment of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) does not affect cell survival for up to 72 hours, which correlates with the absence of a significant change in either CD95 or CD95L expression on treated PBLs. These data show specific involvement of the CD95-CD95L system in the anti-cancer activity of resveratrol and highlight the chemotherapeutic potential of this natural product, in addition to its recently reported chemopreventive activity.
Suspensions of renal cells from rats and renal mitochondria from rats and mice were used to assess the sex and species dependence of acute toxicity due to perchloroethylene (Perc) and its glutathione conjugate S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione (TCVG). A marked sex dependence in the acute cytotoxicity of both Perc and TCVG was observed: Perc caused significant release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in isolated kidney cells from male but not female rats, and TCVG caused much more LDH release from male than female rat kidney cells. Assessment of toxicity in suspensions of isolated mitochondria from kidneys of male and female rats revealed a generally similar pattern of sensitivity, with mitochondria from males exhibiting significantly more inhibition of State 3 respiration and decrease of respiratory control ratio than mitochondria from females. Respiratory function in mitochondria from male and female mice, however, was also significantly inhibited by Perc or TCVG but exhibited little sex dependence in the degree of inhibition. Comparison with results from similar studies using the congener trichloroethylene and its glutathione conjugate suggested that Perc and TCVG are more potent nephrotoxicants. Neither Perc nor TCVG produced any significant effects on cytotoxicity or mitochondrial function in isolated hepatocytes from rats or in isolated liver mitochondria from rats or mice, suggesting that the liver is not a major acute target for Perc or its glutathione conjugate. Thus, many of the species-, sex-, and tissue-dependent differences in toxicity of Perc and TCVG that are observed in vivo are also observed in these in vitro models.
A series of tacrine-NO donor hybrid compounds are synthesized and evaluated for cholinesterase inhibitory activity, cognition improving activity, and hepatotoxicity. The pharmacological results indicate that hybrid compounds 1, 2, and 3a potently inhibit cholinesterase in vitro and significantly improve the scopolamine-induced cognition impairment, whereas an analogue (3h) of 2 without the NO donor moiety does not. Compared to tacrine, 1 and 2 show much less hepatotoxicity. Molecular modeling studies suggest that 2 may interact with the catalytic and the peripheral anionic site of acetylcholinesterase.
A hypertensive response to the induction of anaesthesia with etomidate and atracurium in a patient who recently received tranylcypromine is described. The possible cause is discussed.
Secondary malignancies are a serious adverse consequence of alkylator chemotherapy. The risk of developing an alkylator-associated malignancy is influenced by genetic background, although the relevant genetic factors are poorly understood. To screen for novel susceptibility factors, we established a mouse model of alkylator-induced malignancy. We exposed mice from 20 inbred strains to the prototypical alkylating agent, N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (ENU). ENU was a potent carcinogen in many of the strains tested, inducing 140 tumors in 240 ENU-treated mice (66% incidence of at least one tumor in evaluable mice), compared with a background incidence of 8% spontaneous tumors in 240 strain-, age-, and sex-matched control mice (relative risk, 8.4; P < 0.0001). A wide variety of tumor histologies were noted, including epithelial carcinomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and hematopoietic tumors. Cancer susceptibility was a heritable trait for the most common tumor types, lung adenocarcinoma (H(2) = 0.25), T cell lymphoma (H(2) = 0.19), and myeloid malignancies (H(2) = 0.10). Quantitative trait locus mapping identified regions on chromosomes 3, 6, 9, and 15 containing candidate genes associated with lung adenoma, lung carcinoma, and lymphoma susceptibility. This novel mouse model recapitulates many features of human alkylator-associated cancer and supports the hypothesis that susceptibility to this syndrome is influenced by inherited polymorphisms that could be used to make informed clinical treatment decisions.
We have studied blood pressure and heart rate responses to standing in 29 previously ambulant adult Thai patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria before and after treatment with quinine or mefloquine. There was significant, symptomatic, and usually profound orthostatic hypotension in 12 patients (41%) before antimalarial treatment. The median maximum fall in systolic pressure was 24 mm Hg, significantly greater than the maximum fall in diastolic pressure 16 mm Hg. Blood pressure fell in two phases: an initial transient and usually asymptomatic fall immediately on standing, and a progressive, usually symptomatic fall, worsening over several minutes without a rise in pulse rate. Orthostatic hypotension was associated with core temperature (r = 0.37, P = 0.05). Antimalarial treatment accentuated the delayed orthostatic hypotension during malaria, despite (in the case of quinine) a significant reduction in fever. Both antimalarial drugs attenuated the cardioacceleratory response to symptomatic postural hypotension; the mean reduction in heart rate at the time of lowest blood pressure was 22 beats.min-1. The electrocardiograph ratio of RR intervals at the 30th and 15th beats was reduced significantly in acute malaria, but was not affected further by the drugs. When restudied in convalescence all the patients had normal postural cardiovascular responses. Acute falciparum malaria is associated with impaired circulatory control and the tendency to postural hypotension is worsened significantly by antimalarial treatment with the quinoline antimalarials quinine and mefloquine.
The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone is known to influence a wide range of behavioral effects of cocaine, including its addictive property. In the present study the effects of different doses of naloxone and naloxone-methyl-iodide, a methylated analogon of naloxone that does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, on the action of cocaine in the intravenous self-administration and conditioned place preference (CCP) paradigm were assessed. Systemic naloxone, but not naloxone-methyl-iodide, dose-dependently suppressed cocaine intake during self-administration and decreased the preference for the cocaine-associated compartment in the CCP paradigm. A significant blockade of cocaine's effects was only present at a relatively high dose of NLX (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.). In addition, NLX produced a rightward shift in the inverted U-shaped dose-response curve for cocaine reward during self-administration, indicating a decrease in sensitivity for the reinforcing effects of cocaine. These data demonstrate that blockade of opioid receptors in the brain block both the reinforcing and conditioned motivational effects of cocaine. An interaction between endogenous opioid systems and local dopaminergic systems is suggested in mediating the effects of NLX on cocaine.
Specific electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during clozapine therapy were prospectively studied in a cohort of 50 chronic state hospital patients with schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to one of three nonoverlapping clozapine serum level ranges (50-150 ng/mL, 200-300 ng/mL, and 350-450 ng/mL). EEGs were obtained before clozapine was instituted, and after 10 weeks of treatment. Fifty-three percent of patients showed EEG changes during the 10-week study period. We observed three seizures (6%), one in a patient on 900 mg (serum level 320 ng/mL) clozapine, and two in patients with lower clozapine serum levels (200-300 ng/mL) who had prior histories of seizures and inadequate valproate coverage. Thirteen percent of patients developed spikes with no relationship to dose or serum level of clozapine. Fifty-three percent of patients developed slowing on EEG. Compared to plasma levels below 300 ng/mL, a clozapine serum level between 350 and 450 ng/mL led to more frequent and more severe slowing. The EEG slowing correlated with observed sleepiness, although this factor was not sufficient to explain the severity of high-dose effects.
The reported therapeutic range for trough flecainide concentration is 200-1000 ng mL(-1). Severe adverse events, such as ventricular arrhythmias, have occurred occasionally in patients whose serum flecainide exceeded 1000 ng mL(-1). However, the lower limit remains controversial. We have evaluated blood flecainide concentrations in patients with tachyarrhythmia who received the drug to control palpitation. We measured the flecainide trough levels and incidence and frequency of palpitation of 44 outpatients receiving oral flecainide (150-300 mg daily). Mean serum flecainide trough concentrations differed significantly between patients with (n = 14) and without (n = 30) palpitation (259.5 +/- 85.2 vs 462.2 +/- 197.7 ng mL(-1), P < 0.01). The frequency of palpitation decreased as the serum flecainide concentration increased. The incidence of palpitation was 65% at serum flecainide concentrations < 300 ng mL(-1) and 11% at > or = 300 ng mL(-1). QRS values were increased significantly in patients with serum flecainide < 300 ng mL(-1) compared with > or = 300 ng mL(-1) (0.110 +/- 0.016 s vs 0.093 +/- 0.019 s, P < 0.05). We concluded that to control paroxysm in patients receiving flecainide for tachyarrhythmia serum flecainide concentrations should be maintained at > or = 300 ng mL(-1).
Initial studies of FK506 combined with methotrexate (MTX) in patients receiving unrelated donor BMT have demonstrated a possible-decrease in the incidence of severe GVHD but high rates of severe stomatitis and nephrotoxicity. With this background, we undertook a pilot study evaluating FK506 in combination with a lower than usual dose of MTX in an attempt to improve the tolerability of this immunoprophylaxis regimen. Between July 1993 and October 1994, 26 consecutive adults receiving unrelated donor BMT at Emory University Hospital were enrolled on this study. All patients received FK506 intravenously at an initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day beginning day -1 and continuing until oral FK506 was tolerated. Patients also received MTX intravenously at 5 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. The preparative regimen administered to all but one patient included cyclophosphamide at 200 mg/kg over 4 days followed by total body irradiation (TBI) at 1400 cGy in twice daily fractions over 4 days. The median age of patients was 31 years (range: 19 to 52). Sixteen donor/recipient pairs were matched for HLA-A, -B, and -DR by serology and molecular typing. Ten paris were minor mismatches at either class I or class II. Twenty-two of 26 patients (85%) completed four doses of MTX on schedule. Nephrotoxicity was the most common adverse event associated with the administration of FK506: 88% of patients experienced a doubling of their serum creatinine. One patient died of central nervous system hemorrhage prior to engraftment. Twenty-four of the remaining 25 patients (96%) engrafted. Fourteen of 24 patients (50%) evaluable developed grades 2-4 acute GVHD. The rate of severe (grades 3-4) acute GVHD was 25%. Chronic GVHD developed in 11 of 20 (55%) evaluable patients. At a median follow-up of 461 days, 14 patients (54%) are alive. All are relapse-free with a median Karnofsky performance status of 90% (range: 70-100%). The cumulative probability of 2-year disease-free survival is 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.33 to 0.77); for low risk patients 67% (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95) and for high risk patients 23% (95% CI: 0.049 to 1.00). These preliminary data indicate that FK506-based immunosuppression following unrelated donor BMT is effective in preventing severe acute GVHD and warrants comparison to CSA-based regimens.
To demonstrate that esmolol, sodium nitroprusside, and isoflurane differ in their abilities to alter adrenal medullary blood flow and other peripheral sympathetic responses to hypotension, 16 mongrel dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital were allocated randomly to one of four test groups and given two hypotensive stimuli, separated by 1 h, to a mean arterial blood pressure of 60 mm Hg for 10 min. The first stimulus, induced by blood loss into a pressurized bottle system, constituted the control for each animal. The second hypotensive stimulus was created by either repeat blood loss (Group 1), esmolol infusion (Group 2), sodium nitroprusside infusion (Group 3), or isoflurane administration (Group 4). Before and 10 min into hypotension, the variables of abdominal organ blood flow, adrenal medullary blood flow, arterial norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were measured. In the control animals (Group 1), comparable decreases in abdominal organ blood flow and similar increases in adrenal medullary blood flow, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were elicited by the first and second hypotensive stimulus. Esmolol-induced hypotension (Group 2) abolished the increase in adrenal medullary blood flow and attenuated the increase in epinephrine by 65% (P < 0.03). The decrease in abdominal organ blood flow and the increase in norepinephrine were similar to that observed during baseline hemorrhagic hypotension. In contrast, sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension (Group 3) abolished abdominal organ vasoconstriction whereas the increases in adrenal medullary blood flow, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were comparable to baseline hemorrhagic hypotension. In fact, abdominal organ blood flow increased 2.5-fold (P < 0.001) during hypotension with SNP. Isoflurane 2%, 1.54 minimum alveolar anesthesia concentration (Group 4), abolished the increases in adrenal medullary blood flow, norepinephrine, and epinephrine observed during baseline hemorrhagic hypotension and attenuated the decrease in abdominal organ blood flow by 70% (P < 0.001). These data demonstrate that esmolol, sodium nitroprusside, and isoflurane differ radically in their ability to alter or blunt peripheral sympathetic responses to hypotension, and suggest that isoflurane is the drug most effective in blunting multiple responses of the peripheral sympathetic system.
Repeated cocaine exposure up-regulates cyclic AMP signaling and increases the transcriptional activity of cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus accumbens. To study the possibility that nucleus accumbens CREB activity regulates self-administration behavior, we tested the effects of a single, bilateral infusion of CREB antisense oligonucleotide into nucleus accumbens core and shell sub-regions on cocaine self-administration in rats. Nucleus accumbens core infusions of CREB antisense reduced CREB and the CREB-regulated immediate early gene brain-derived neurotrophic factor by 31 and 27%, respectively, but failed to alter levels of the homologous CREB family proteins cyclic AMP response element modulator and activating transcription factor 1, and had no effect on CREB levels in adjacent nucleus accumbens shell tissue. Similar infusions of CREB antisense in either core or shell produced a transient downward shift in cocaine self-administration dose-response curves on a fixed ratio 5 (five responses/injection) reinforcement schedule, indicating a reduction in cocaine reinforcement that fully recovered 3 days after treatment. CREB antisense also increased the threshold dose of cocaine required for reinstating cocaine self-administration, indicating that nucleus accumbens CREB levels regulate the incentive properties of cocaine. When access to cocaine was less restricted on a fixed ratio 1 schedule, infusion of CREB antisense in the core, but not shell, caused a transient (1-2 days) reduction in stabilized cocaine self-administration, but had no effect on responding maintained by sucrose pellets, indicating that basal CREB levels in the nucleus accumbens core regulate drug intake. None of these effects were produced by nucleus accumbens infusions of complementary sense oligonucleotide. These results suggest a necessary role for nucleus accumbens CREB activity in cocaine reinforcement, and, by converse analogy, up-regulation in CREB activity after chronic cocaine use could contribute to addiction-related increases in cocaine self-administration.
The search for tumour-specific markers is one of the chief goals in cancer biology. We show that the translocation t(12;16)(q13:p11) in malignant myxoid liposarcoma can be a fusion of the CHOP dominant negative transcription factor gene with a novel gene, FUS, which can result in fusion of the FUS glycine-rich protein with the whole CHOP coding region. The data support the concept that protein fusion may commonly occur in solid tumours resulting in tumour-specific markers of potential clinical importance. The data also indicate the importance of transcription disruption in the pathogenesis of solid tumours.
