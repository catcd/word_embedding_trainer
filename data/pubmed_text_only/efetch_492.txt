To determine incidence and identify predisposing factors for sterile hemorrhagic cystitis (SHC) in dogs with lymphoma that were treated with cyclophosphamide and to evaluate whether furosemide administered i.v. concurrently with cyclophosphamide decreased the incidence of SHC.
Retrospective study.
216 dogs with lymphoma.
Medical records of dogs with lymphoma that received cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in accordance with 1 of 2 protocols, with or without concurrent i.v. administration of furosemide, were examined. Data for the 2 groups were analyzed to determine the incidence and predisposing factors (age, breed, sex, weight, previous or preexisting disease, previous or preexisting urinary tract infection, neutropenia, azotemia, dose, and number of cyclophosphamide treatments) for cyclophosphamide-associated SHC.
Cyclophosphamide-associated SHC developed in 12 of 133 (9%) dogs that had not received concurrent administration of furosemide and cyclophosphamide treatments; of the 83 dogs that had received furosemide, only 1 (1.2%) developed SHC. Dogs receiving cyclophosphamide and furosemide concurrently were significantly less likely to develop SHC than dogs that did not receive furosemide. Dogs with previous or preexisting immune-mediated disease were significantly more likely to develop cyclophosphamide-associated SHC.
Analysis of results suggested an association between i.v. administration of furosemide concurrently with cyclophosphamide and decreased incidence of cyclophosphamide-associated SHC. Incidence of cyclophosphamide-associated SHC was similar in treated dogs that did not receive concurrent furosemide to that observed for other studies in which cyclophosphamide was administered orally. Cyclophosphamide-associated SHC appeared to develop early during the course of chemotherapy when furosemide was not administered concurrently with cyclophosphamide.
It is likely that human genetic differences mediate susceptibility to viral infection and virus-triggered disorders. OAS genes encoding the antiviral enzyme 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2'5'AS) are critical components of the innate immune response to viruses. This enzyme uses adenosine triphosphate in 2'-specific nucleotidyl transfer reactions to synthesize 2',5'-oligoadenylates, which activate latent ribonuclease, resulting in degradation of viral RNA and inhibition of virus replication. We showed elsewhere that constitutive (basal) activity of 2'5'AS is correlated with virus-stimulated activity. In the present study, we asked whether constitutive activity is genetically determined and, if so, by which variants. Analysis of 83 families containing two parents and two children demonstrated significant correlations between basal activity in parent-child pairs (P<.0001) and sibling pairs (P=.0044), but not spousal pairs, suggesting strong genetic control of basal activity. We next analyzed association between basal activity and 15 markers across the OAS gene cluster. Significant association was detected at multiple markers, the strongest being at an A/G single-nucleotide polymorphism at the exon 7 splice-acceptor site (AG or AA) of the OAS1 gene. At this unusual polymorphism, allele G had a higher gene frequency in persons with high enzyme activity than in those with low enzyme activity (0.44 vs. 0.20; P=3 x 10(-11)). Enzyme activity varied in a dose-dependent manner across the GG, GA, and AA genotypes (tested by analysis of variance; P=1 x 10(-14)). Allele G generates the previously described p46 enzyme isoform, whereas allele A ablates the splice site and generates a dual-function antiviral/proapoptotic p48 isoform and a novel p52 isoform. This genetic polymorphism makes OAS1 an excellent candidate for a human gene that influences host susceptibility to viral infection.
To study the alterations of FHIT gene and P16 gene in malignant transformed human bronchial epithelial cells induced by crystalline nickel sulfide using an immortal human bronchial epithelial cell line, and to explore the molecular mechanism of nickel carcinogenesis.
16HBE cells were treated 6 times with different concentrations of NiS in vitro, and the degree of malignant transformation was determined by assaying the anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity. Malignant transformed cells and tumorigenic cells were examined for alterations of FHIT gene and P16 gene using RT-PCR, DNA sequencing, silver staining PCR-SSCP and Western blotting.
NiS-treated cells exhibited overlapping growth. Compared with that of negative control cells, soft agar colony formation efficiency of NiS-treated cells showed significant increases (P < 0.01) and dose-dependent effects. NiS-treated cells could form tumors in nude mice, and a squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed by histopathological examination. No mutation of exon 2 and exons 2-3, no abnormal expression in p16 gene and mutation of FHIT exons 5-8 and exons 1-4 or exons 5-9 were observed in transformed cells and tumorigenic cells. However, aberrant transcripts or loss of expression of the FHIT gene and Fhit protein was observed in transformed cells and tumorigenic cells. One of the aberrant transcripts in the FHIT gene was confirmed to have a deletion of exon 6, exon 7, exon 8, and an insertion of a 36 bp sequence replacing exon 6-8.
The FHIT gene rather than the P16 gene, plays a definite role in nickel carcinogenesis. Alterations of the FHIT gene induced by crystalline NiS may be a molecular event associated with carcinogen, chromosome fragile site instability and cell malignant transformation. FHIT may be an important target gene activated by nickel and other exotic carcinogens.
Tetrathiomolybdate is an anticopper drug with a unique mechanism of action. Tetrathiomolybdate complexes copper to protein and itself, rendering the copper unavailable for cellular uptake. It was originally developed for Wilson's disease, and is now being developed as an antiangiogenic agent for the treatment of cancer. Many angiogenic cytokines require normal levels of copper, and lowered copper levels reduce cytokine signaling while cellular copper requirements are met. Cytokines of fibrosis and inflammation may be similarly copper dependent, since tetrathiomolybdate inhibits bleomycin induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. The basis for this inhibition was evaluated here by examination of tetrathiomolybdate effects on cytokines in lung pathophysiologically important in the bleomycin mouse model of pulmonary damage. Results in mice injected endotracheally with bleomycin confirmed that tetrathiomolybdate therapy was effective in reducing fibrosis. This effect was associated with significant inhibition of bleomycin-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha and transforming growth factor beta expression in lung homogenates. These effects were shown to be independent of one another. This indicates that tetrathiomolybdate therapy can be effective even when fibrosis is at a more chronic stage, wherein inflammatory cytokines are playing a diminishing role. The inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha suggests that diseases of tumor necrosis factor alpha overexpression are also potential targets of tetrathiomolybdate therapy.
We report the case of a 22-year-old woman presenting major depressive episode with severe akathisia after an increase in fluoxetine. The patient developed severe restlessness and de novo suicidal ideation approximately 1 week after the dosage of fluoxetine was doubled, 1 year on from when the drug was first introduced. This case illustrates the importance of being alert to movement disorders in patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The clinical implications are discussed. A management strategy based on the evidence in the existing literature is suggested.
The present study was designed to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and prostaglandins on hyperalgesia induced in rats by excitatory amino acids and the possibility that prostaglandins may act as the retrograde messenger in the spinal cord like NO. Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 500 microg/paw, intraplantarly (i.pl.)), MK-801 (10 microg/paw, i.pl.) or indomethacin (300 microg/paw, i.pl.) reduced the duration of phase 2 of the biting/licking and scratching (B/L + S) response induced by formalin injection from 255.6+/-16.7 s to 155.6+/-16.9, 172.25+/-33.3 or 205.6+/-16.7 s, respectively. L-NAME (0.3 mg, i.th.), MK-801 (8 microg, i.th.) or indomethacin (20 microg, i.th) reduced the duration of phase 2 of the B/L + S response induced by saline injection from 288.5+/-7.7s to 207.7+/-19.2, 184.6+/-7.7 or 1923+/-38.5 s, respectively. L-NAME or indomethacin injected into the spinal cord of the rat significantly reduced the hyperalgesia induced by NMDA (1 microg, i.th.) from 43.8+/-4.6% to 12.3+/-3.1 and 19.2+/-2.3%, respectively. It is assumed that NO produced by excitatory amino acids may increase prostaglandin production by cyclooxygenase activation. L-NAME, MK-801 or indomethacin injected into the rat spinal cord significantly reduced the hyperalgesia induced by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 25 ng, i.th.) in the tail-flick test from 40.6+/-3.5% to 18.2+/-3.2, 18.8+/-1.8 or 17.6+/-4.1%, respectively, but had little effect on hyperalgesia in the paw pressure test (except for indomethacin). In conclusion, NO and PGE2 affect the hyperalgesia induced by excitatory amino acids. It is suggested that PGE2, like NO, may act as a retrograde messenger in the spinal cord.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress are tightly linked with cancers including gliomas. We previously reported the protective role of X box-binding protein-1 (XBP1) against oxidative stress in both mouse embryofibroblasts and human Hela cells. This study was to investigate XBP1-mediated protection against oxidative stress in the treatment of gliomas.
XBP1 expression levels were knocked down by siRNA transfection in the U251MG cell line. After exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) or the ROS inducer arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss, ROS levels and the expression of several antioxidant molecules were examined. Expression of XBP1 and antioxidant molecules was also detected in surgically excised specimens from 30 patients with glioma, and 10 normal brain control specimens obtained at autopsy.
XBP1 knockdown significantly enhanced the cell death fraction, MMP loss and ROS levels in H(2)O(2)- or As(2)O(3)-treated glioma cells, concomitant with a decrease of several antioxidant molecules including catalase. Moreover, the abundant expression of XBP1 and antioxidant molecules was also observed in human glioma specimens, as compared with normal brain tissues.
XBP1 confers an important role in protection against oxidative stress in gliomas, potentially via up-regulation of antioxidant molecules such as catalase. Targeting XBP1 may have synergistic effects with ROS inducers on glioma treatment.
Beclomethasone dipropionate is an inhaled corticosteroid, used for the treatment of asthma. It is metabolised to 17-beclomethasone monopropionate, which has greater affinity for corticosteroid receptors than the parent compound, and to beclomethasone. We investigated the potency of beclomethasone dipropionate, 17-beclomethasone monopropionate and beclomethasone (compared with dexamethasone as a reference steroid) in two different human cell types, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and osteoblasts. We found that beclomethasone dipropionate, 17-beclomethasone monopropionate (EC50 10(-14) M) and beclomethasone (EC50 approx. 10(-12) M) were much more potent than dexamethasone (EC50 10(-8) M) in inhibiting interleukin-5 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, beclomethasone dipropionate, 17-beclomethasone monopropionate and beclomethasone were equipotent with dexamethasone (EC50 range 0.3-1.2 x 10(-9) M) in affecting several functional assays of osteoblasts (e.g. alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin synthesis). These results show that the relative bioactivities of corticosteroids vary between different human cell types, and that affinities observed in receptor binding assays are not necessarily predictive of the bioactivity in cell populations, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells and osteoblasts, which are putatively relevant to efficacy and side effects respectively.
MgSO4 is widely used for tocolysis. Serious complications are rare as long as dosing is carefully monitored. Adverse effects in muotonic dustrophy have not been previously described.
A 35-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, was hospitalized with suspected mild myotonic dystrophy, polyhydramnios and preterm labor at 33 weeks. MgSO4 infusion rapidly resulted in respiratory compromise. Muscular strength returned to baseline after the infusion was stopped. Mother and infant proved to have myotonic dystrophy.
The choice of tocolytic medication in maternal myotonic dystrophy is problematic. Beta-2 sympathomimetics have been reported to precipitate myotonia. This case illustrates the potential for MgSO4 to cause respiratory embarrassment. Indomethacin may be the tocolytic of choice in myotonic dystrophy.
Research indicates that the use of recreational drugs, including MDMA ('ecstasy') can result in impairments in cognitive functioning. Recent evidence, based on accounts of 'on drug' effects and cortical binding ratios suggests that women may be more susceptible to the effects of MDMA; however, no research has explored whether there are differences in the long-term behavioural sequelae of the drug between men and women. In addition, little is known about the profile of functioning of the 'typical' user. The present investigation accessed a large sample of recreational drug users, using the Internet, to obtain self-reports of memory functioning with a view to exploring any differences in self-reported ability amongst male and female users, and the level of difficulty reported by the 'typical' ecstasy user. A web site (www.drugresearch.org.uk) was developed and used for data collection. Prospective memory ability was assessed using the Prospective Memory Questionnaire. Self-report of day-to-day memory performance was investigated using the Everyday Memory Questionnaire. The UEL Drug Questionnaire assessed the use of other substances. The number of mistakes made while completing the questionnaires was also taken as an objective measure of performance errors. Findings, based on datasets submitted from 763 respondents, indicate no differences in self-reports of functioning between male and female participants. An overall dissociation between the effects of cannabis and ecstasy on self-reported memory functioning and on the likelihood of making an error during the completion of the questionnaire was found. Typical ecstasy users were found to report significantly more difficulties in long-term prospective memory and to make more completion errors than users of other substances and drug naive controls. Whilst taking into account the fact that participants were recruited via the World Wide Web and that a number of stringent exclusion criteria were applied to the data, a number of conclusions can be drawn. Recreational drug users perceive their memory ability to be impaired compared to non-users. The type of memory difficulties reported varies depending upon the drug of choice. These difficulties are exacerbated in ecstasy users. Individuals reporting average levels of use of ecstasy are more likely to report memory problems than non-ecstasy drug users or drug free individuals. The deleterious effects of ecstasy are therefore not restricted to heavy or chronic users. No gender differences were detected, suggesting that there may be a dissociation between cognitive impairment and cortical binding worthy of further exploration.
To determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of the nucleoside analogue, 3TC.
A Phase I, open-label, single-centre study.
Twenty asymptomatic, HIV-infected male patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts < 500 x 10(6)/l who had not received previous antiretroviral therapy completed the study. Each patient received a single intravenous dose followed by a single oral dose of 3TC. Four patients were dosed at each of five dose levels (0.25, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 mg/kg).
The most commonly reported adverse event was headache, which was generally reported to be mild. The mean bioavailability of 3TC was 82% following oral administration. The majority of the dose (approximately 70%) was excreted unchanged in the urine.
Overall, 3TC was well tolerated following dosing, and there were no significant changes in the safety parameters measured. Phase I/II clinical trials with 3TC are ongoing to evaluate its safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity.
Glycogen storage disease type II (GSD II) is an autosomal recessive deficiency of acidalpha-1,4-glucosidase(GAA) caused by mutations in the GAA gene located on human chromosome 17 (17q 25.2-q 25.3). Although its pathophysiology is partially understood, it has not yet been elucidated whether the level of GAA deficiency is directly proportional to the level of glycogen storage, vacuolar degeneration and/or GSD II severity. Muscle and skin biopsies were taken from three female patients with symptoms of progressive muscle weakness and respiratory failure: patient 1 aged 19, as well as patients 2 and 3 (two sisters) aged 31 and 29, respectively. Initial clinical manifestations, respiratory failure and muscle weakness, were similar in all the examined patients, while their character and intensity differed. For each examined patient, the activity of lysosomal GAA (at pH 3.8) was measured fluorometrically in isolated blood leukocytes (L) and dried blood spots (DBS). Biopsy samples were studied histologically, immunohistologically and ultrastructurally. Each of them displayed similar morphological features, although with different intensity. Muscle fibres were irregular in size with smaller non-rounded fibres and vacuolar degeneration. Invacuoles,we observed glycogen and intense positive ubiquitin reaction. Myofibrils were almost completely destroyed by the accumulation of glycogen granules in lysosomes and those free, without limiting membranes as well as by vacuoles of various size. Autophagic vacuoles were visible occasionally. Excess glycogen was also present in the walls of muscle and skin capillaries. All three patients showed reduced GAA activity ratios measured at pH 3.8 with and without acarbose (patient 1 - 0.12 in DBS and 0.07 in L; patient 2 - 0.05 in DBS and 0.07 in L; and patient 3 - 0.12 in DBS and 0.09 in L). Based on the study results, we concluded that GAA deficiency in vitro in late-onset type II glycogenosis was not directly proportional to the amount of glycogen storage, vacuolar degeneration and disease severity.
Intraspecific apomorphine-induced aggressive behavior in the rat was not affected following electrolytic lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus. Some inhibition of the aggressive behavior was found after lateral lesions and an almost total suppression after destruction of globus pallidus. These results, as well as those following localized injections of apomorphine into the septum, substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus suggested that the latter anatomical region may be the major site of the action of apomorphine in the behavior studies. The role of acetylcholine is discussed.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the rate of temperature increase on the intensity of the evoked pain before and after hyperalgesia induced by topical capsaicin. Further, hyperalgesia to suprathreshold heat stimuli was investigated. Thirteen healthy volunteers were included in the experiment. All stimuli were applied in randomised order within the volar surface of both forearms using a computer-controlled contact stimulator. In one of the forearms, the effect of the rate of temperature change was investigated for 1.0, 5.0, and 8.0 degrees C/s reaching a peak temperature of 30.0, 33.0, 36.0, 39.0, and 42.0 degrees C in the primary hyperalgesic area and reaching a peak temperature of 33.0, 36.0, 39.0, 42.0, 45.0, 47.0, and 49.0 degrees C in the secondary hyperalgesic area before and after the induction of hyperalgesia. In the other forearm, the same procedure was repeated without capsaicin application as a control measurement. After the induction of hyperalgesia, the pain ratings were significantly higher in the arm treated with capsaicin compared with baseline for 36, 39, and 42 degrees C heating rates in the primary hyperalgesic area. The pain ratings were significantly higher with 1 degrees C/s heating rate compared with 5 and 8 degrees C/s for 36, 39, and 42 degrees C in the primary hyperalgesic area. Heat hyperalgesia was also observed within the secondary hyperalgesic area to pin-prick for stimulus temperatures of 45, 47, and 49 degrees C compared with the baseline measurements. Increased ratings were found for all three heating rates in the secondary hyperalgesic area. There were no heat hyperalgesia in the control arm. In conclusion, hyperalgesia to suprathreshold heat stimuli was observed in the secondary hyperalgesic area and C-fibres play an important role in the primary hyperalgesia to heat.
The combination of lithium carbonate and neuroleptic is frequently used in the treatment of bipolar disorders. Four patients exhibited permanent neurological sequelae including cerebellar, pyramidal and extra-pyramidal signs after a long-term therapy with this association. Fever, stupor and pulmonary event were initially present. Neuropathological findings in one case only showed selective degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, also noted as a characteristic feature in heat stroke and malignant hyperthermia. Lithium carbonate may be the main factor of neurotoxicity but hyperthermic states are probably involved in determinating brain damage, particularly cerebellar lesions.
The occurrence of apoptosis in heart, kidney and small intestine was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with doxorubicin (1 mg/kg/week for 6, 9 and 12 weeks) with and without pretreatment with the iron chelator ICRF-187 [(+)1.2-bis(3.5-dioxopiperazinyl-l-yl)propane] (25 mg/kg, i.p., given 30 min before doxorubicin). Animals receiving either ICRF-187 alone or saline were used as controls. Cells undergoing apoptosis were identified ultrastructurally and by staining using the nick-end labeling method. The results obtained by counting cells with positive nick-end labeling showed that, when given in cumulative doses of 9 and 12 (but not 6) mg/kg, doxorubicin induced significant toxicity in the heart, kidneys and intestine in association with apoptosis in epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa and renal tubules but not in cardiac myocytes. At these doses nick end labeling in the heart was confined to occasional endothelial cells, interstitial dendritic cells and macrophages. The frequency of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in renal and intestinal epithelial cells was decreased by pretreatment of the SHR with ICRF-187. Our data support the concept that the chronic cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin is not mediated by apoptosis of the cardiac myocytes.
The conditioning of cocaine's subjective actions with environmental stimuli may be a critical factor in long-lasting relapse risk associated with cocaine addiction. To study the significance of learning factors in persistent addictive behavior as well as the neurobiological basis of this phenomenon, rats were trained to associate discriminative stimuli (S(D)) with the availability of i.v. cocaine vs. nonrewarding saline solution, and then placed on extinction conditions during which the i.v. solutions and S(D)s were withheld. The effects of reexposure to the S(D) on the recovery of responding at the previously cocaine-paired lever and on Fos protein expression then were determined in two groups. One group was tested immediately after extinction, whereas rats in the second group were confined to their home cages for an additional 4 months before testing. In both groups, the cocaine S(D), but not the non-reward S(D), elicited strong recovery of responding and increased Fos immunoreactivity in the basolateral amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (areas Cg1/Cg3). The response reinstatement and Fos expression induced by the cocaine S(D) were both reversed by selective dopamine D(1) receptor antagonists. The undiminished efficacy of the cocaine S(D) to elicit drug-seeking behavior after 4 months of abstinence parallels the long-lasting nature of conditioned cue reactivity and cue-induced cocaine craving in humans, and confirms a significant role of learning factors in the long-lasting addictive potential of cocaine. Moreover, the results implicate D(1)-dependent neural mechanisms within the medial prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala as substrates for cocaine-seeking behavior elicited by cocaine-predictive environmental stimuli.
An increased incidence of cancer in patients suffering from acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is thought to be related to delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) accumulation. Chronic treatment with ALA augmented 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine levels, decreased microsomal and mitochondrial membrane fluidity and increased lipid peroxidation in blood serum. Co-treatment with melatonin completely counteracted the effects of ALA. Melatonin effectively protects DNA and microsomal and mitochondrial membranes in rat kidney from oxidative damage due to ALA. Because of its low toxicity and anticarcinogenic properties, melatonin could be tested as an agent to reduce oxidative damage in patients with AIP.
To evaluate the role of liver transplantation after paracetamol overdose.
Prospective study of consecutive candidates for transplantation and performance of transplantation over 18 months.
Liver unit, King's College Hospital, London.
Fulfilment of indicators of poor prognosis, selection for transplantation, transplantation, survival.
30 of 37 patients considered to have a reasonable prognosis with intensive medical care survived. Of 14 of 29 patients considered to have a very poor prognosis and registered for urgent liver transplantation, six received liver transplants, four of whom survived, while seven died and one survived without a transplant. Three of 15 patients with poor prognostic indicators but not selected for transplantation survived.
Liver transplantation will have a definite but limited role in the management of fulminant hepatic failure induced by paracetamol.
Promotion of lung tumors in mice by the food additive butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is mediated by electrophilic metabolites produced in the target organ. Identifying the proteins alkylated by these quinone methides (QMs) is a necessary step in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Covalent adducts of the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxin 6 and Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase were detected previously in lung cytosols from BALB/c mice injected with BHT, and complimentary in vitro studies demonstrated that QM alkylation causes inactivation and enhances oxidative stress. In the present work, adducts of another protective enzyme, carbonyl reductase (CBR), were detected by Western blotting and mass spectrometry in mitochondria from lungs of mice one day after a single injection of BHT and throughout a 28-day period of weekly injections required to achieve tumor promotion. BHT treatment was accompanied by the accumulation of protein carbonyls in lung cytosol from sustained oxidative stress. Studies in vitro demonstrated that CBR activity in lung homogenates was susceptible to concentration- and time-dependent inhibition by QMs. Recombinant CBR underwent irreversible inhibition during QM exposure, and mass spectrometry was utilized to identify alkylation sites at Cys 51, Lys 17, Lys 189, Lys 201, His 28, and His 204. Except for Lys 17, all of these adducts were eliminated as a cause of enzyme inhibition either by chemical modification (cysteine) or site-directed mutagenesis (lysines and histidines). The data demonstrated that Lys 17 is the critical alkylation target, consistent with the role of this basic residue in NADPH binding. These data support the possibility that CBR inhibition occurs in BHT-treated mice, thereby compromising one pathway for inactivating lipid peroxidation products, particularly 4-oxo-2-nonenal. These data, in concert with previous evidence for the inactivation of antioxidant enzymes, provide a molecular basis to explain lung inflammation leading to tumor promotion in this two-stage model for pulmonary carcinogenesis.
Extraction and clearance kinetics of [1-11C]acetate were examined in 65 experiments in 30 open-chest dogs. Twenty-nine studies were performed at control, 13 during ischemia, eight after reperfusion, 13 during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, and two during alteration of cardiac workload. [1-11C]Acetate was injected directly into the left anterior descending coronary artery, and myocardial tissue-time activity curves were recorded with a gamma probe. The single-pass extraction fraction averaged 64.2 +/- 9.7% in control, 65.3 +/- 9.1% in ischemia, 70.0 +/- 4.4% in reperfusion, and 46.5 +/- 7.4% in dipyridamole-induced hyperemia groups. 11C clearance was biexponential in all cases. The rate constant k1 for the first rapid clearance phase correlated closely with myocardial oxygen consumption (r = 0.94) in control, ischemia, reperfusion, and dipyridamole-induced hyperemia groups. Monoexponential fitting of only the first linear part of the clearance curve yielded the rate constant kmono, which also correlated with myocardial oxygen consumption (r = 0.96). Arterial lactate concentrations and the amount of free fatty acid oxygen equivalents consumed by the myocardium were shown to have a small but statistically significant impact on the relation between [1-11C]acetate clearance rate constants and myocardial oxygen consumption. The fraction of 14CO2 activity contributing to overall 14C activity leaving the myocardium after simultaneous injection of [1-14C]acetate (n = 24) was relatively high in all cases (97.4 +/- 2.5% in control, 89 +/- 2.6% in ischemia, 94.1 +/- 3.5% in reperfusion, and greater than 99% in dipyridamole groups), indicating that externally measured 11C clearance corresponds to CO2 production and thus to tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In conclusion, the results validate the use of [1-11C]acetate as a tracer of oxidative myocardial metabolism for use with positron emission tomography.
Patients with schizophrenia frequently develop drug-induced hyperprolactinaemia and consequent hypogonadism. Reduced bone mineral density as a consequence of hyperprolactinaemia-induced hypogonadism has been well documented in medical, but not psychiatric, disorders. Little attention has been given to the potential risk of developing osteoporosis secondary to anti-psychotic-induced hyperprolactinaemia. Three cases are presented that illustrate how this debilitating but silent disease may affect even those young individuals with schizophrenia.
Experimental studies have proven that melatonin has many beneficial pleiotropic actions. The aim of this study was to assess melatonin efficacy in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). The study included 33 healthy volunteers (who were not treated with melatonin) and 30 patients with MS, who did not respond to 3-month lifestyle modification. Patients with MS were treated with melatonin (5 mg/day, 2 hr before bedtime) for 2 months. The following parameters were studied: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), levels of glucose, serum lipids, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, activities of antioxidative enzymes: catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), thiobarbituric acid reactive substrates (TBARS). After 2-month therapy in comparison with baseline, the following significant changes were measured: systolic blood pressure (132.8±9.8 versus 120.5±11.0 mmHg, P<0.001), DBP (81.7±8.8 versus 75±7.4 mmHg, P<0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (149.7±26.4 versus 139.9±30.2 mg/dL, P<0.05), TBARS (0.5±0.2 versus 0.4±0.1 μm/gHb, P<0.01), and CAT (245.9±46.9 versus 276.8±39.4 U/gHb). Melatonin administered for 2 months significantly improved antioxidative defense (increase in CAT activity, decrease in TBARS level) and lipid profile (decrease in LDL-C), and lowered blood pressure. We conclude that melatonin therapy may be of benefit for patients with MS, particularly with arterial hypertension. Further studies with higher doses of melatonin or prolonged supplementation are awaited.
A 32-year-old woman presented with an acute anterior-lateral myocardial infarction 7 days postpartum. Coronary angiography revealed an occlusive left main coronary artery dissection. After coronary artery bypass surgery the patient's cardiac function improved and stabilized. Thrombocytopenia and a femoral artery thrombosis after 9 days of heparin exposure marked the development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis that was successfully managed with argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor anticoagulant.
We report the case of a 44-year-old female patient with paranoid schizophrenia, who developed blepharospasm on risperidone treatment, but who was successfully rechallenged by risperidone without recurrence of blepharospasm. Possible mechanisms of action and implications for clinical care are discussed.
