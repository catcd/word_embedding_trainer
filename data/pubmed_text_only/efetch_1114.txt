We carried out a fine-mapping study in the HNF1B gene at 17q12 in two study populations and identified a second locus associated with prostate cancer risk, approximately 26 kb centromeric to the first known locus (rs4430796); these loci are separated by a recombination hot spot. We confirmed the association with a SNP in the second locus (rs11649743) in five additional populations, with P = 1.7 x 10(-9) for an allelic test of the seven studies combined. The association at each SNP remained significant after adjustment for the other SNP.
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in DNA repair genes can be used to explain the differences in survival of platinum-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients regardless of their performance status. To define the role of DNA repair gene SNPs in NSCLC patients, we investigated the association between survival and 12 different SNPs of 9 DNA repair genes.
340 patients were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Polymorphisms were detected by real time PCR with TaqMan probe, using genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples. Multivariate logistic or Cox regression analyses were used to adjust for possible confounding variables.
The median overall survival time was 15 months and it was significantly longer in patients harboring ERCC1 118 C/T or T/T allele: 18 months as compared to 13.8 months for the C/C allele (P=0.014). Subgroup analysis revealed that ERCC1 118 C/T or T/T was associated with increased survival in elderly patients (P=0.018), male (P=0.022), squamous carcinoma (P=0.003), smoker (P=0.076) and those treated with non-gemcitabine/cisplatin or carboplatin (non-GP/GC) regimen (P=0.023). XRCC3C/C was associated with better survival in non-gemcitabine/cisplatin treated patients (P=0.014). Both of CCNH-V270A C/C or C/T and XPD 751 A/A showed a significant longer survival in the squamous cell carcinoma subgroup (P=0.047 and P=0.034 respectively).
Present data indicates that ERCC1 118 C/T or T/T might provide a better prognostic predictive marker of NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, mainly in elderly subgroup, male, squamous carcinoma, smoker and those treated with non-GP/GC regimen.
Glucocorticoids promote macrophage phagocytosis of leukocytes undergoing apoptosis. Prereceptor metabolism of glucocorticoids by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11beta-HSDs) modulates cellular steroid action. 11beta-HSD type 1 amplifies intracellular levels of active glucocorticoids in mice by reactivating corticosterone from inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone in cells expressing the enzyme. In this study we describe the rapid (within 3 h) induction of 11beta-HSD activity in cells elicited in the peritoneum by a single thioglycolate injection in mice. Levels remained high in peritoneal cells until resolution. In vitro experiments on mouse macrophages demonstrated that treatment with inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone for 24 h increased phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils to the same extent as corticosterone. This effect was dependent upon 11beta-HSD1, as 11beta-HSD1 mRNA, but not 11beta-HSD2 mRNA, was expressed in these cells; 11-dehydrocorticosterone was ineffective in promoting phagocytosis by Hsd11b1(-/-) macrophages, and carbenoxolone, an 11beta-HSD inhibitor, prevented the increase in phagocytosis elicited in wild-type macrophages by 11-dehydrocorticosterone. Importantly, as experimental peritonitis progressed, clearance of apoptotic neutrophils was delayed in Hsd11b1(-/-) mice. These data point to an early role for 11beta-HSD1 in promoting the rapid clearance of apoptotic cells during the resolution of inflammation and indicate a novel target for therapy.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the follow-up of pain processing recovery in hyperalgesic fibromyalgia (FM) could be objectively evaluated with brain perfusion ethyl cysteinate dimer single photon computerized tomography (ECD-SPECT) after administration of ketamine.
We enrolled 17 hyperalgesic FM women patients (48.5 +/- 11 years, range 25-63). After treatment with subcutaneous ketamine, 11 patients were considered as "good responders", with a decrease in pain intensity, evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS), greater than 50%. On the other hand, six patients were considered as "poor responders". A voxel-based analysis of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was conducted (p (voxel) < 0.001uc), in the two subgroups of patients, before and after treatment, in comparison to a group of ten healthy subjects, matched for age and gender.
In comparison to baseline brain SPECT, midbrain rCBF showed a greater increase after ketamine in the responder group than in the nonresponder group (p (cluster) = 0.016c). In agreement with the clinical response, the change in midbrain rCBF after ketamine was highly correlated with the reduction of VAS pain score (r = 0.7182; p = 0.0041).
This prospective study suggests that blockade of facilitatory descending modulation of pain with ketamine can be evaluated in the periaqueductal grey with brain perfusion SPECT.
Ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO), a processing aid used in the production of fluoropolymers, produces hepatomegaly and hepatocellular hypertrophy in rodents. In mice, APFO-induced hepatomegaly is associated with increased activation of the xenosensor nuclear receptors, PPARα and CAR/PXR. Although non-genotoxic, chronic dietary treatment of Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats with APFO produced an increase in benign tumours of the liver, acinar pancreas, and testicular Leydig cells. Most of the criteria for establishing a PPARα-mediated mode of action for the observed hepatocellular tumours have been previously established with the exception of the demonstration of increased hepatocellular proliferation. The present study evaluates the potential roles for APFO-induced activation of PPARα and CAR/PXR with respect to liver tumour production in the S-D rat and when compared to the specific PPARα agonist, 4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthioacetic acid (Wy 14,643). Male S-D rats were fed APFO (300 ppm in diet) or Wy 14,643 (50 ppm in diet) for either 1, 7, or 28 days. Effects of treatment with APFO included: decreased body weight; hepatomegaly, hepatocellular hypertrophy, hepatocellular hyperplasia (microscopically and by BrdU labelling index), and hepatocellular glycogen loss; increased activation of PPARα (peroxisomal β-oxidation and microsomal CYP4A1 protein); decreased plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and glucose; increased activation of CAR (CYP2B1/2 protein) and CAR/PXR (CYP3A1 protein). Responses to treatment with Wy 14,643 were consistent with increased activation of PPARα, specifically: increased CYP4A1 and peroxisomal β-oxidation; increased hepatocellular hypertrophy and cell proliferation; decreased apoptosis; and hypolipidaemia. With the exception of decreased apoptosis, the effects observed with Wy 14,643 were noted with APFO, and APFO was less potent. These data clearly demonstrate an early hepatocellular proliferative response to APFO treatment and suggest that the hepatomegaly and tumours observed after chronic dietary exposure of S-D rats to APFO likely are due to a proliferative response to combined activation of PPARα and CAR/PXR. This mode of action is unlikely to pose a human hepatocarcinogenic hazard.
A 17-year-old male patient appeared with the biochemical liver damage associated with hypoceruloplasminemia and mild iron overload. Genetic analysis identified a compound heterozygosity of ATP7B responsible for the primary copper toxicosis of Wilson disease without mutations in HFE. A liver specimen consisted of cirrhotic nodules of large-sized hepatocytes with fatty change and those of fat-free small-sized hepatocytes. Histochemically, iron was distributed diffusely in the small-sized hepatocytes, while copper grains appeared in a few of the hepatocytes near the fibrous bands. X-ray microanalysis on the liver tissue fixed with a 0.1% osmium tetroxide solution and embedded in epoxy resin disclosed (1) complex formation of copper with sulfur, and iron with phosphorus in the hepatocyte lipofuscin particles, (2) intraparticle localization of the cuprothionein in the less dense matrix and ferric proteins in the dense matrix, and (3) high affinity of the cuprothionein to lead staining. Considering the fact that ceruloplasmin is the major ferroxidase essential for iron efflux, iron deposits in the hypoceruloplasminemic patients with Wilson disease are not a complication, but a natural event. This study disclosed for the first time the diagnostic ultrastructures of Wilson disease, which might represent different detoxification processes to the reactive metals of copper and iron.
The potent serotonin receptor (5-HT3) antagonists are new highly selective agents for the prevention and control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that have been shown to be comparable to or more effective than traditional metoclopramide regimens. This study was designed to compare the antiemetic efficacy of dolasetron and metoclopramide in chemotherapy-naive and non-naive cancer patients receiving high-dose cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This multicentre, double-blind, randomized trial compared the efficacy and safety of single i.v. doses of dolasetron mesilate salt (1.2 or 1.8 mg/kg) and metoclopramide (7 mg/kg) in 226 patients for the prevention of acute emesis and nausea associated with the administration of high-dose (> or = 80 mg/m2) cisplatin. Efficacy and safety were evaluated for 24 h. Complete responses were achieved by 57%, 48%, and 35% of patients given dolasetron mesilate 1.8 mg/kg (P = 0.0009 vs metoclopramide), dolasetron mesilate 1.2 mg/kg (P = 0.0058 vs metoclopramide), and metoclopramide, respectively. Overall, dolasetron was significantly more effective than metoclopramide for time to first emetic episode, nausea, patient satisfaction, and investigator global assessment of efficacy. Males, chemotherapy-naive patients, and alcoholics had higher response rates. Dolasetron was well tolerated, with mild-to-moderate headache most commonly reported. Twelve percent of patients receiving metoclopramide reported extrapyramidal symptoms compared with 0% of patients receiving dolasetron. In conclusion, dolasetron mesilate was effective for the prevention of CINV with high-dose cisplatin. Single i.v. doses of dolasetron mesilate were more effective than 7 mg/kg metoclopramide in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. In addition, 1.8 mg/kg dolasetron mesilate consistently produced the highest response rates and appears to be the most effective dose for further clinical development.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of four different doses of granisetron when administered as a single intravenous (i.v.) dose for prophylaxis of cisplatin-induced emesis in a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind investigation. A total of 353 chemotherapy-naive patients were enrolled, stratified according to cisplatin dose (moderate dose: 50-80 mg/m2, n = 169; high dose: 81-120 mg/m2, n = 184) and randomized to one of four granisetron doses: 5, 10, 20, or 40 micrograms/kg. Control of emesis was evaluated by the percentages of patients attaining complete response (no vomiting or retching, and no rescue medication) and major response (< or = 2 episodes of vomiting or retching, and no rescue medication). Patients were assessed on an inpatient basis for 18-24 h. Safety analyses consisted of adverse events and laboratory parameter changes. Complete response rates over 24 h after chemotherapy were 23%, 48%, 48%, and 44% for granisetron doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 micrograms/kg, respectively, in the combined patient population (P = 0.011 for linear trend); 29%, 56%, 58%, and 41%, respectively, in the moderate-dose cisplatin stratum (P = 0.278 for linear trend); and 18%, 41%, 40%, and 47%, respectively, in the high-dose cisplatin stratum (P = 0.011 for linear trend). Transient headache was the most frequently reported adverse event (19%). There was no evidence of association between increased dose and headache. A single 10-, 20- or 40-micrograms/kg dose of granisetron is comparably effective in controlling nausea and vomiting associated with moderate or high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy. Granisetron was safe and well tolerated at all doses.
Patients with a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia have significant rates of concurrent amphetamine use. Such dual diagnosis patients have been shown to have poorer treatment outcomes. Often, they do not comply with treatment plans and have frequent episodes of hospitalization. There is growing evidence for the role of prescribed dexamphetamine in the treatment of amphetamine dependence. The prescription of dexamphetamine to patients with schizophrenia and amphetamine dependence has not been previously reported. Eight schizophrenic patients are described to whom dexamphetamine has been prescribed, with information being extracted retrospectively from case notes. In four out of eight cases, the prescription of dexamphetamine led to apparently good progress both in terms of substance misuse and psychiatric health. In two cases, progress was more equivocal, but appeared to produce some benefit. Two cases could be judged as treatment failures, but the condition and situation of the patients were not worse at the end of treatment than at the beginning. Compliance with neuroleptics increased in most cases. No patients exhibited exacerbation of psychosis as a result of treatment. The rate of outcome success is satisfactory when consideration is given to the difficult nature of this patient group, and their previous failure to respond to intensive treatment. It is argued that benefits may be gained from increased compliance with psychiatric treatment in patients prescribed amphetamine, and that this may outweigh possible risks. However, any conclusions are tentative in view of the nature of this study. A small open-label prospective study is recommended.
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is associated with changes in hippocampal function/morphology. These changes often manifest as a decline in cognitive abilities, which in animal models is reflected in reduced spatial learning and up-regulation or down-regulation of synaptic plasticity. Beyond this, however, changes also occur in other, extralimbic structures, as has been shown on the neurochemical level. Here, our aim was to test whether functional changes occur also in corticostriatal synaptic communication, also because the striatum is instrumental in motor planning and coordination and hence serves important nonlimbic functions.
We analyzed corticostriatal long-term potentiation (LTP) in brain slices of pilocarpine-treated rats after status epilepticus (SE). To determine whether chronic seizures, or SE itself, impact basal ganglia function, tissue was investigated (1) shortly after SE (3-5 days, acute group), and (2) after chronic epilepsy had been established (chronic group, 4-10 weeks after SE).
Early after SE, only little synaptic plasticity emerged. In the chronic group, however, LTP was enhanced significantly in the SE group versus control preparations. Using pharmacologic blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, LTP in chronically epileptic tissue could be dissected into an early, NMDA-dependent and a late, NMDA-independent phase, which reverted to LTD with additional dopamine D₁/D₅ receptor blockade.
We conclude that chronic limbic epilepsy goes along also with functional alterations in extralimbic structures such as the striatum.
Vigabatrin is an efficacious antiepileptic drug licensed as add-on therapy in refractory epilepsy and used in infantile spasms. Eight years after licensing, there emerged a strong and possibly causative association with bilateral visual field loss. We report a systematic review ascertaining the magnitude of risk of vigabatrin associated visual field loss (VAVFL) and any clinical predictors of risk.
Electronic searches, including MEDLINE (1966-2009), EMBASE (1974-2009), and CINAHL (1982-2009), were conducted. Reports, published in full, of observational studies investigating the prevalence of visual field loss in patients with partial epilepsy treated with vigabatrin were included. Outcomes were the proportion with visual field loss, and the relative risk of VAVFL compared to similar nonexposed patients with epilepsy.
Thirty-two studies were identified, which included 1,678 patients exposed to vigabatrin and 406 controls. Of the 1,678 exposed patients, 738 (44%) had visual field loss compared to just 30 (7%) among the 406 controls. The random-effects estimate for the proportion of adults with visual field loss was 52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 46-59]. The estimate for children was lower at 34% (95% CI 25-42). The relative risk for field loss in vigabatrin-exposed patients was 4.0 (95% CI 2.9-5.5). Larger mean cumulative dose of vigabatrin and increasing age were associated with a higher proportion of patients with visual field loss.
Vigabatrin should be reserved for patients with epilepsy for whom there is no other alternative or for patients who have determined the benefit of ongoing treatment to outweigh the risk of VAVFL.
Little experience exists with the use of arsenic trioxide in the treatment of recurrent, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-resistant, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The authors report a patient with multiply recurrent APL treated with arsenic trioxide (As2O3), which was administered as recommended in the protocol from the People' s Republic of China. The results of this treatment and its toxicity are discussed. The available literature on arsenic therapy is reviewed.
The patient was a 15-year-old African-American girl with APL that had resisted conventional chemotherapy, ATRA therapy followed by autologous peripheral stem cell transplant, and a second course of ATRA induction therapy administered for relapse after transplant. The patient was treated with 10 mg As2O3 intravenously for 28 days. After a 4-week break, she received a second 28-day course of As2O3 therapy.
After completion of the first 28-day course of As2O3 treatment, morphologic and cytogenetic remission occurred. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated persistence of the PML-RARalpha fusion transcript. After the second course of As2O3, the patient had a complete remission by morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular criteria. Approximately 6 months after the end of two courses of As2O3 therapy, the patient again underwent relapse. An additional course of As2O3 achieved a morphologic, although not a cytogenetic or molecular, remission.
As2O3 therapy produced remission in a patient with multiply relapsed, ATRA-resistant APL. Toxic side effects were minimal. The patient underwent relapse 6 months after this therapy. Further investigation will be necessary to determine the proper role of As2O3 therapy in patients with APL.
To report the abnormal multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) findings in two cases of presumed ethambutol toxicity.
Retrospective observational case series.
Two patients with ethambutol toxicity and visual loss.
Multifocal electroretinography.
Waveform measurements on multifocal electroretinography.
Two patients with bilateral visual loss due to ethambutol toxicity underwent mfERG testing that disclosed both diffuse and central field loss compatible with retinal dysfunction as a contributing mechanism to the visual field loss.
Ethambutol toxicity affects not only the optic nerve but probably other retinal elements based upon abnormal mfERG findings.
We describe the case of a patient showing bilateral disk edema linked to amiodarone intake and discuss the controversial physiopathology of this condition. The clinical investigation as well as the follow-up of this case established the diagnosis of amiodarone-induced papillary disease. Pseudotumor cerebri and alteration of optic disk vascularization were also involved in the optic neuropathy displayed by this patient. This case illustrates the multifactorial character of this entity whose heterogeneous clinical expression is linked both to the direct toxic effect of amiodarone and the likely occurrence of pseudotumor cerebri, as well as to the disorders for which this type of medication is frequently used. Amiodarone is widely used and its implication as a cause of disk swelling should be systematically investigated.
We cloned a rat vascular chymase (RVCH) from smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that converts angiotensin I to II and is up-regulated in SMC from spontaneously hypertensive vs. normotensive rats. To determine whether increased activity of RVCH is sufficient to cause hypertension, transgenic mice were generated with targeted conditional expression of RVCH to SMC, with the use of the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA). We confirmed conditional expression of RVCH by mRNA, protein, and chymase activity in the absence, but not in the presence, of dietary doxycycline. The systolic blood pressure (mmHg), measured by carotid artery cannulation at 10-12 weeks of age, was higher in tTA+/RVCH+ mice than in nonbinary transgenic littermates (136 +/- 4 vs. 109 +/- 3) (P < 0.05), as were the diastolic and mean pressures. Hypertension was completely reversed by doxycycline, suggesting a causal link with chymase expression. Medial thickening of mesenteric arteries from tTA+/RVCH+ mice vs. littermates (0.82 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.02) (P < 0.05) was associated with increased SMC proliferation, as judged by positive immunoreactivity, with the use of an antibody to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. These structural changes were prevented by doxycycline. Perfusion myography of mesenteric arteries from tTA+/RVCH+ mice also revealed increased vasoconstriction in response to phenylephrine and impaired metacholine-induced vasodilatation when compared with littermate controls or with the doxycyline-treated group. Our studies suggest that up-regulation of this vascular chymase is sufficient to cause a hypertensive arteriopathy, and that RVCH may be a candidate gene and a therapeutic target in patients with high blood pressure.
The chloracetanilide herbicide alachlor (2-chloro-2',6-diethyl-N-(methoxymethyl)-acetanilide) induces nasal neoplasms in rats following chronic dietary exposure. The present study sought to identify the cellular origin and mechanisms of tumor induction and progression. Male Long-Evans rats were fed alachlor (0 or 126 mg/kg/day) beginning at 6 weeks of age. Following 1 month of alachlor ingestion, neither histological abnormalities nor enhanced cell division (assessed by BrdU incorporation) occurred in any region of the nasal cavity. Six months of alachlor exposure resulted in proliferation of basal and nonbasal cells in the olfactory mucosa while inducing nasal masses in 7 of 15 animals. Tumors ranged from dysplastic plaques to polypoid adenomas and originated in the olfactory regions of the nasal cavity. Neoplasms were associated with regions of respiratory metaplasia and were often covered with a low cuboidal, poorly ciliated epithelium. Tumor cells did not express characteristics of the olfactory mucosa, including olfactory marker protein (OMP, for neurons) and NMa (antibody recognizing cytochrome P450 [CYP] 2A3, found in Bowman's glands). Sites of plaque and tumor development coincided with regions of NMa immunoreactivity. These data suggest that local metabolism is important in alachlor-induced olfactory tumors and support the concept that metaplastic respiratory epithelial cells give rise to the observed neoplasms.
To investigate the association of CYP17 polymorphism with 17β-estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) concentration in hypospadias.
Two-hundred twenty-three boys (91 with hypospadias and 132 age-matched controls) were included in the study. CYP17 polymorphism was evaluated using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method, whereas T and E2 levels were estimated in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Association between CYP17 genotypes and 17β-E2, T, and their ratio (E2/T) was analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. 17β-E2, T, and E2/T ratio was also compared among the different degrees of hypospadias, as well as in controls, by unpaired Student's t-test.
Significantly low levels of T were observed in severe-degree hypospadias (n = 14; mean ± SD = 1.01 ± 0.57) compared with mild cases (n = 77; mean ± SD = 1.93 ± 1.40) and controls (mean ± SD = 3.32 ± 2.06) (P <.05). E2/T ratio was also significantly higher in hypospadias cases (5.36 ± 3.55) compared with controls (2.21 ± 2.52). Heterozygous variants (A1/A2) of CYP17 were present in higher frequency (OR = 0.96; 95% CI = .518-1.770) and homozygous (A2) variants were less frequently found in hypospadias (OR = 0.87; 95% CI = .363-2.077), but results were insignificant. No association between 17β-E2 and T with different CYP17 genotypes was observed.
Our study suggests that, although polymorphism in CYP17 gene may not be associated with 17β-E2 and T concentrations in hypospadias cases, low levels of T and higher E2/T ratio might possibly act as risk factors for hypospadias.
In this study, we compared haemodynamic changes, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion time, and complications in patients anesthetized by inhalation of sevoflurane with those of intravenous induction with propofol. One hundred patients, aged between 20-40 years were enrolled in this study. Group 1 received propofol (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) and group 2 received sevoflurane (6%+50% N2O+50% O2) by inhalation using the tidal volume technique. LMA insertion time was found to be significantly longer in sevoflurane group than in propofol group. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly lower within each group after induction in comparison to before induction values. In both groups, the LMA was successfully inserted in all patients. The quality of anaesthesia according to patients was significantly higher in the propofol group (80%) than in sevoflurane group (30%). Odor perception was significantly higher in sevoflurane group (84%) than in propofol group (38%). Apnoea was significantly higher in propofol group (40%) than in sevoflurane group (0%). Sevoflurane is an alternative to propofol for induction of anaesthesia and has a lower incidence of apnoea. Other complication rates are not higher than which propofol but the longer duration of induction time is a disadvantage.
Ciprofloxacin is a commonly used antibiotic for gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract infections with a considerably good safety profile. However, occasionally it may cause life-threatening complications. Two case reports of bone marrow depression and 1 case of thrombocytopenia due to ciprofloxacin therapy have been reported in literature. We report a case of bone marrow depression due to ciprofloxacin therapy for urinary tract infection in an otherwise healthy woman.
Accidental intrathecal vincristine instillation is usually a fatal error. The authors report an analysis of a patient and suggest means with which to reduce such errors.
A 7-year-old girl with recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia was inadvertently injected intrathecally with 1.5 mg vincristine. A detailed analysis of the events leading to this error and a review of all reported cases in the English literature were undertaken.
Reasons for errors reported by us and other institutions included mistaking vincristine for an intended intrathecal drug, assuming vincristine was an additional drug to be injected, not checking physician orders, mistaken route of administration, and mislabeling of syringes.
Intrathecal injection of vincristine may be the end-result of a series of systems errors. Protocol recommendations to reduce the likelihood of this error are presented.
Electrocardiographic changes in patients with acute leukoses treated with Rubidomycin were observed. In 28 out of 40 followed-up patients changes were found in the form of sinus tachycardia, in 3 of them rhythm changes were observed in the form of extra systols, in 6 low segment S-T, in 12 changes of T waves (lower or isoelectric in 5, negative in 3, and high, pointed in 4 patients). In one patient there was found more prominent right axial deviation and the appearance of small Q in the site not seen before. In addition ot ECG, blood pictue and electrolytes were examined. Parallel occurence of anaemia and sinus tachycaria were found, while electrolytes mostly remained in normal limits. More significant and multiple changes were found in one patient, most often when the administration of a drug was followed by ECG. Lack of appearance of ECG changes in a certain number of our patinets most probably resulted from undue recording, and not from the harmful effect of a drug.
In patients with coronary artery disease and reduced ejection fraction, amiodarone reduces mortality by decreasing sudden death. Because the latter may be triggered by coronary artery thrombosis as much as ventricular arrhythmias, amiodarone might interfere with tissue factor (TF) expression and thrombus formation.
Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of amiodarone reduced TF activity and impaired carotid artery thrombus formation in a mouse photochemical injury model in vivo. PTT, aPTT, and tail bleeding time were not affected; platelet number was slightly decreased. In human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, amiodarone inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and thrombin-induced TF expression as well as surface activity. Amiodarone lacking iodine and the main metabolite of amiodarone, N-monodesethylamiodarone, inhibited TF expression. Amiodarone did not affect mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, TF mRNA expression, and TF protein degradation. Metabolic labeling confirmed that amiodarone inhibited TF protein translation.
Amiodarone impairs thrombus formation in vivo; in line with this, it inhibits TF protein expression and surface activity in human vascular cells. These pleiotropic actions occur within the range of amiodarone concentrations measured in patients, and thus may account at least in part for its beneficial effects in patients with coronary artery disease.
Effects of vanilloid-receptor agonists and antagonists on HCl-induced gastric lesions in rats were investigated to elucidate the role of vanilloid receptor type 1 (VR1) in gastric mucosal defense mechanisms.
Gastric lesions in rats were evaluated after intragastric administration of 0.6 N HCl. The localization of VR1 in the stomach was investigated immunohistochemically.
Intragastric administration of capsaicin inhibited the formation of gastric lesions in a dose-dependent manner (0.1-2.5 mg/kg). The functional VR1 antagonists ruthenium red and capsazepine markedly aggravated HCl-induced gastric lesions in rats. The gastroprotective effect of capsaicin was attenuated by ruthenium red or capsazepine. It is reported that resiniferatoxin, [6]-gingerol and lafutidine are compounds that activate VR1 and/or capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons. These compounds significantly inhibited the formation of HCl-induced gastric lesions, and their gastroprotective effects were inhibited by treatment with ruthenium red. The immunohistochemical studies revealed that nerve fibers expressing VR1 exist along gastric glands in the mucosa, around blood vessels in the submucosa, in the myenteric plexus, and in the smooth muscle layers, especially the circular muscle layer.
The results of this study suggest that VR1 plays a protective role in the gastric defensive mechanism in rats.
