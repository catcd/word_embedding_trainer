The authors describe a case of bipolar affective disorder associated with disulfiram therapy and its interaction with ethanol. They recommend caution when prescribing disulfiram for patients with personal and familial antecedents of affective illness.
Alpha 2-adrenergic agonists decrease sympathetic tone with ensuing attenuation of neuroendocrine and hemodynamic responses to anesthesia and surgery. The effects of dexmedetomidine, a highly specific alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, on these responses have not been reported in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
Eighty patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting received, in a double-blind manner, either a saline placebo or a dexmedetomidine infusion, initially 50 ng.kg-1.min-1 for 30 min before induction of anesthesia with fentanyl, and then 7 ng.kg-1.min-1 unit the end of surgery. Filling pressures, blood pressure, and heart rate were controlled by intravenous fluid and by supplemental anesthetics and vasoactive drugs.
Compared with placebo, dexmedetomidine decreased plasma norepinephrine concentrations by 90%, attenuated the increase of blood pressure during anesthesia (3 vs. 24 mmHg) and surgery (2 vs. 14 mmHg), but increased slightly the need for intravenous fluid challenge (29 vs. 20 patients) and induced more hypotension during cardiopulmonary bypass (9 vs. 0 patients). Dexmedetomidine decreased the incidence of intraoperative (2 vs. 13 patients) and postoperative (5 vs. 16 patients) tachycardia. Dexmedetomidine also decreased the need for additional doses of fentanyl (3.1 vs. 5.4), the increments of enflurane (4.4 vs. 5.6), the need for beta blockers (3 vs. 11 patients), and the incidence of fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity (15 vs. 33 patients) and postoperative shivering (13 vs. 23 patients).
Intraoperative intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine to patients undergoing coronary artery revascularization decreased intraoperative sympathetic tone and attenuated hyperdynamic responses to anesthesia and surgery but increased the propensity toward hypotension.
To evaluate the frequency of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene amplification and the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to uPA inhibition, as we previously found one hormone-refractory prostate tumour with high-level amplification of the uPA (alias PLAU) gene, and also showed that a uPA inhibitor, amiloride, can effectively reduce the invasion potential of the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line.
Sixty-three locally recurrent hormone-refractory tumours and 78 hormone-refractory metastases from 29 patients who died from prostate cancer were analysed for uPA gene-copy number using fluorescence in situ hybridization. The Matrigel invasion assay was used to study the influence of uPA inhibitors on the invasive potential of prostate cancer cell lines.
Of the locally recurrent hormone-refractory tumours, 21% had an increased copy number of uPA, but no high-level amplifications were found; 31% of the metastases had increased copy number and one high-level amplification of the uPA. Matrigel invasion assays with two specific uPA inhibitors, B428 and p-aminobenzamidine, showed that invasion of a prostate cancer cell line containing uPA gene amplification was inhibited by these small-molecule uPA inhibitors, while invasion of prostate cell lines without uPA gene amplification were not.
These results suggest that selective inhibition of the uPA pathway in individuals whose tumours contain uPA gene amplification may provide therapeutic benefit.
A 36-year-old woman was treated with tamoxifen for lung metastasis of breast cancer and had marked hyperlipoproteinemia with giant fatty liver, high plasma triglyceride levels (3673 mg/dl), and increased levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoprotein (UDL). A low level of activity of both plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL) was also noted. Our observations support the concept that, in some patients, the weak estrogen-like activity of tamoxifen is amplified and, in severe lipemia, reduction of the activities of LPL and HTGL might impede the conversion of VLDL to LDL, thus causing the amplification of the effect.
Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) by 3-hour infusion was combined with carboplatin in a phase I/II study directed to patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Carboplatin was given at a fixed target area under the concentration-time curve of 6.0 by the Calvert formula, whereas paclitaxel was escalated in patient cohorts from 150 mg/m2 (dose level I) to 175, 200, 225, and 250 mg/m2. The 225 mg/m2 level was expanded for the phase II study since the highest level achieved (250 mg/m2) required modification because of nonhematologic toxicities (arthralgia and sensory neuropathy). Therapeutic effects were noted at all dose levels, with objective responses in 17 (two complete and 15 partial regressions) of 41 previously untreated patients. Toxicities were compared with a cohort of patients in a phase I trial of paclitaxel alone at identical dose levels. Carboplatin did not appear to add to the hematologic toxicities observed, and the paclitaxel/carboplatin combination could be dosed every 3 weeks.
Classic galactosemia is a genetic disorder that results from profound loss of galactose-1P-uridylyltransferase (GALT). Affected infants experience a rapid escalation of potentially lethal acute symptoms following exposure to milk. Dietary restriction of galactose prevents or resolves the acute sequelae; however, many patients experience profound long-term complications. Despite decades of research, the mechanisms that underlie pathophysiology in classic galactosemia remain unclear. Recently, we developed a Drosophila melanogaster model of classic galactosemia and demonstrated that, like patients, GALT-null Drosophila succumb in development if exposed to galactose but live if maintained on a galactose-restricted diet. Prior models of experimental galactosemia have implicated a possible association between galactose exposure and oxidative stress. Here we describe application of our fly genetic model of galactosemia to the question of whether oxidative stress contributes to the acute galactose sensitivity of GALT-null animals. Our first approach tested the impact of pro- and antioxidant food supplements on the survival of GALT-null and control larvae. We observed a clear pattern: the oxidants paraquat and DMSO each had a negative impact on the survival of mutant but not control animals exposed to galactose, and the antioxidants vitamin C and Î±-mangostin each had the opposite effect. Biochemical markers also confirmed that galactose and paraquat synergistically increased oxidative stress on all cohorts tested but, interestingly, the mutant animals showed a decreased response relative to controls. Finally, we tested the expression levels of two transcripts responsive to oxidative stress, GSTD6 and GSTE7, in mutant and control larvae exposed to galactose and found that both genes were induced, one by more than 40-fold. Combined, these results implicate oxidative stress and response as contributing factors in the acute galactose sensitivity of GALT-null Drosophila and, by extension, suggest that reactive oxygen species might also contribute to the acute pathophysiology in classic galactosemia.
To further investigate the rationale for using spinal nerve stimulation (SNS) for treating bladder overactivity associated with cystitis in a rat model of cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis, as several studies suggested that symptoms associated with chronic cystitis could be treated using stimulation of sacral spinal nerves, but the mechanisms by which it works are unknown.
Cystitis was induced by i.p. injection of cyclophosphamide 48 h before the experiments in anaesthetized male rats. Neurograms were taken by placing a recording electrode onto the pelvic nerve and a stimulating electrode on either the L6 or S1 ipsilateral spinal nerves. Two selected intensities were then evaluated for SNS in control and cyclophosphamide-treated rats during cystometry.
Cyclophosphamide resulted in significant bladder overactivity. There was no apparent difference in the neurograms generated in response to SNS of the S1 and L6 spinal nerves, and between cyclophosphamide and control rats. Intensities of 200 microA (Adelta-fibre-specific) and 2 mA (Adelta+ C-fibres) were chosen for SNS. Continuous SNS at 200 microA significantly reduced the frequency of voiding and non-voiding contractions in cyclophosphamide-treated rats. SNS at 2 mA resulted in the abolition of voiding contractions, accompanied by continuous leakage of urine.
SNS recruiting only Adelta-fibre produced fewer voiding contractions in cyclophosphamide-treated rats, to a level similar to that from the control rats. These results support the ability of SNS to decrease bladder overactivity in a pathophysiological model of chemical irritation of the bladder.
To examine the contribution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to neurocognitive dysfunction in individuals with comorbid HIV infection or methamphetamine (METH) dependence.
Neurocognitive functioning was examined in 430 study participants who were either normal controls or had HCV infection, HIV infection, history of METH dependence, or combinations of these factors as risks for cognitive deficits.
Rates of global and domain-specific neuropsychological (NP) impairment increased with the number of risk factors. HCV serostatus was a significant predictor of NP performance both globally and in the areas of learning, abstraction, and motor skills, with trends in speeded information processing and delayed recall. HCV serostatus did not predict scores in attention/working memory or verbal fluency.
Hepatitis C virus infection contributes to the neuropsychological deficits observed among HIV-infected and stimulant-dependent populations.
A 51-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and mild hypertension developed acute interstitial nephritis 4 days after starting a course of co-trimoxazole for bronchopneumonia. Following initial symptoms of overt hypersensitivity, he developed azotemia and renal tubular dysfunction with malaise and anorexia requiring hospitalization. Renal pathology demonstrated an acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis superimposed on chronic diabetic renal disease.
We present the case of an elderly patient who died of fulminant hepatic failure in the course of receiving 2 months of treatment with pyrazinamide and rifampin for his latent tuberculosis. This 2-month course of treatment for latent tuberculosis is one of four options recently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We discuss the safety of using this two-drug regimen to treat latent tuberculosis in stable elderly patients.
Foreign body aspiration in adults has a variety of clinical presentations and often goes unrecognized. We describe the case of a patient who experienced crack cocaine aspiration and presented with symptoms of an acute asthma exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation until the eventual diagnosis and bronchoscopic removal of the foreign body.
Acute myopathy following mechanical ventilation for near-fatal asthma (NFA) has been described recently, and some researchers have suggested that this complication is related to the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) and corticosteroids (CSs).
To determine the incidence of acute myopathy in a group of patients and to examine the most important predictors of its development.
A retrospective cohort study over a 10-year period (1985 to 1995) of all asthma patients who received mechanical ventilation at two centers in Vancouver (designated center 1 and center 2).
In center 1, there were 58 patients who had 64 episodes of NFA, and in center 2, there were 28 patients who had 30 episodes. NMBAs were used in 30 of 86 admissions for acute severe asthma (35%). The mean (+/- SD) duration of muscle paralysis was 3.1+/-2.3 days. A total of 9 patients (10.4%) developed significant myopathy. The incidence of myopathy was 9 of 30 (30%) among patients who received NMBAs. In a multiple logistic regression model, the development of myopathy was only significantly associated with the duration of muscle relaxation. The odds ratio for the development of myopathy increased by 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.2) with each additional day of muscle relaxation. The dose and the type of the CS were not significantly associated with the myopathy in the multiple logistic regression analysis.
Our study showed that there is a high incidence of acute myopathy when NMBAs are used for NFA. The incidence of myopathy increases with each additional day of muscle relaxation.
The effects of methimazole, an antithyroid drug, on blood pressure and other parameters were evaluated in the established phase of Goldblatt two-kidney one clip (G2K-1C) hypertension. Methimazole was administered via drinking water for five weeks, starting five weeks after hypertension had been induced. After this period of treatment, similarly high blood pressures were observed in methimazole-treated and non-treated G2K-1 C rats, despite the fact that a hypothyroid state had been achieved in methimazole-treated rats. Methimazole-treated G2K-1 C rats showed reductions in heart rate, ventricular weight, ventricular/body weight ratio and mortality in comparison with rats not treated with methimazole. These results clearly demonstrate that hypothyroidism induced by methimazole: a) does not reverse G2K-1 C hypertension, but b) improves the rate of survival and c) reduces relative cardiac hypertrophy, possibly by the reduction in cardiac work observed in Goldblatt hypothyroid rats.
The protective efficacy of diallyl tetrasulfide (DTS) from garlic on liver injury induced by cadmium (Cd) was investigated. In this study, Cd (3 mg/kg body weight) was administered subcutaneously for 3 weeks to induce toxicity. DTS was administered orally (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg body weight) for 3 weeks with subcutaneous (sc) injection of Cd. Cd-induced liver damage was evidenced from increased activities of serum hepatic enzymes, namely aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase, with significant elevation of lipid peroxidation indices (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and hydroperoxides) and protein carbonyl groups in the liver. Rats subjected to Cd toxicity also showed a decline in the levels of total thiols, reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C and vitamin E, accompanied by an increased accumulation of Cd, and significantly decreased activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the liver. Administration of DTS at 40 mg/kg body weight significantly normalised the activities of hepatic marker enzymes, compared to other doses of DTS (10 and 20 mg/kg body weight). In addition, DTS (40 mg/kg body weight) significantly reduced the accumulation of Cd and the level of lipid peroxidation, and restored the level of antioxidant defense in the liver. Histological studies also showed that administration of DTS to Cd-treated rats resulted in a marked improvement of hepatocytes morphology with mild portal inflammation. Our results suggest that DTS might play a vital role in protecting Cd-induced oxidative damage in the liver.
Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that are structurally and functionally similar to mammalian estrogens. By competing for estrogen receptors, phytoestrogens possibly inhibit binding of the more potent endogenous estrogens and decrease their potential effects on breast cancer risk. We investigated the association between plasma phytoestrogen levels and breast cancer risk in a prospective manner.
We performed a nested case-control study within the Prospect cohort, one of the two Dutch cohorts participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. A total of 383 women (87 pre- or perimenopausal women [mean age, 52 years] and 296 postmenopausal women [mean age, 59 years]) who developed breast cancer were selected as case subjects and were matched to 383 controls, on date of blood sampling. Plasma levels of isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin, and equol) and lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) were measured. The isotope dilution liquid chromatography/tandem mass-spectrometry method incorporating triply 13C-labeled standards was used for all analyses. Breast cancer odds ratios were calculated for tertiles of phytoestrogen plasma levels using conditional logistic regression analysis.
For genistein, the risk estimate for the highest versus the lowest tertile was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.98). Similar protective effects, although not statistically significant, were seen for the other isoflavones. Lignan levels did not appear to be related to breast cancer risk. Results were the same in pre- or perimenopausal women, and in postmenopausal women.
High genistein circulation levels are associated with reduced breast cancer risk in the Dutch population. No effects of lignans on breast cancer risk were observed.
Tamoxifen (TAM) is an anti-neoplastic drug used for the treatment of breast cancer. It decreases the hexose monophosphate shunt and thereby increasing the incidence of oxidative stress in cells leading to tissue injury. The present study was undertaken to investigate modulatory effects of taurine on the nephrotoxicity of TAM with special reference to protection against disruption of nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants. Oxidative stress was measured by renal lipid peroxidation (LPO) level, protein carbonyl (PC) content, reduced glutathione (GSH), activities of phase I and II drug metabolizing and antioxidant enzymes. TAM treatment resulted in a significant (P < 0.001) increase in LPO in kidney tissues as compared to control, while taurine pretreatment showed a significant decrease (P < 0.01) in the LPO in kidneys when compared with the TAM-treated group. Taurine + TAM group animals showed restoration in the level of cytochrome P450 content, activities of glutathione metabolizing enzymes viz., glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Pretreatment of animals with taurine markedly attenuated, PC content, restored the depleted nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants. These results clearly demonstrate the role of oxidative stress, and suggest a protective effect of taurine on TAM-induced nephrotoxicity in mice.
Pharmacological inhibitors of the transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²) type I receptor (ALK5) have shown promise in blocking growth of xenotransplanted cancer cell lines but the effect on a multistage cancer model is not known. To test this, we treated mouse skin with SB431542 (SB), a well-characterized ALK5 inhibitor, during a two-stage skin carcinogenesis assay. Topical SB significantly reduced the total number, incidence and size of papillomas compared with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) promotion alone, and this was linked to increased epidermal apoptosis, decreased proliferation and decreased cutaneous inflammation during promotion. In contrast, the frequency of conversion to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was 2-fold higher in papillomas treated with SB. Although there was no difference in tumor cell proliferation in early premalignant lesions, those that formed after SB treatment exhibited reduced squamous differentiation and an altered inflammatory microenvironment similar to SCC. In an inducible epidermal RAS transgenic model, treatment with SB enhanced proliferation and cutaneous inflammation in skin but decreased expression of keratin 1 and increased expression of simple epithelial keratin 18, markers of premalignant progression. In agreement with increased frequency of progression in the multistage model, SB treatment resulted in increased tumor formation with a more malignant phenotype following long-term RAS induction. In contrast to the current paradigm for TGFÎ² in carcinogenesis, these results demonstrate that cutaneous TGFÎ² signaling enables promotion of benign tumors but suppresses premalignant progression through context-dependent regulation of epidermal homeostasis and inflammation.
Abnormal beta(2)-adrenoceptor density and beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) responses were inconsistently reported in major depressive disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants downregulate beta-adrenoceptor density and decrease coupling to G(s) protein. Abnormal beta-adrenoceptor coupling may exist in major depressive disorder and may relate to treatment response. We investigated beta(2)-adrenoceptor coupling to G(s) protein in 25 controls, 23 major depressive disorder drug-free patients and 16 major depressive disorder patients after chronic imipramine treatment using agonist displacement experiments. Pretreatment beta(2)-adrenoceptor coupling and density were normal in patients as a whole. Chronic imipramine induced beta(2)-adrenoceptor uncoupling. This effect was observed in treatment responders who had increased beta(2)-adrenoceptor density in the high-conformational state and supercoupling prior to treatment. Beta(2)-adrenoceptor density decreased after imipramine treatment. Treatment non-responders had seemingly normal pretreatment beta(2)-adrenoceptor function, which was not changed by imipramine. Differences in beta(2)-adrenoceptor regulation in major depressive disorder may underlie treatment response. The results indirectly implicate abnormal agonist-mediated beta(2)-adrenoceptor gene expression, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C in major depressive disorder.
We present here a patient with end stage renal failure who received two weeks antimalarial prophylaxis at full dose leading to life threatening toxicity with severe acute megaloblastic anaemia, symptomatic pancytopenia and exfoliative dermatitis. Prompt recognition and treatment can rapidly reverse these fatal effects but more importantly, education of patients before travel is imperative in preventing such events.
The i.v. administration of amphepramone in dogs induced a dose-related depressor reaction. This effect was due to a peripheral myotropic vasodilatation. When the drug was administered intracerebroventricularly it elicited a marked pressor response, due, to the release of catecholamines with its subsequent action on alpha-adrenergic receptors. Small doses of amphepramone administered in dogs, rats and rabbits, induced a sinus tachycardia. Larger doses brought about a sinus bradycardia, bradyarrhythmias, extrasystoles, ventricular bradycardia and ventricular fibrillation or asystolia. The respiratory movements as well as the EEG tracings were depressed by larger doses of amphepramone.
This study compared the adverse effects of formalin administered by two different methods. Formalin mixed with the feed (2.5, 5.0 and 10 ml/kg) was given to 10-week-old White Leghorn cockerels for a period of 8 weeks. Simultaneously in other groups, a 3% solution of formalin was administered into the crops (5, 10, 15 and 20 ml/bird/day). Total amount of formalin utilized during the experiment in the feed of individual bird of groups given 2.5, 5 and 10 ml/kg was 6.25, 3.9 and 1.6% higher than those administered 5, 10 and 20 ml of 3% formalin into crop, respectively. Body mass and feed intake in all feed-mixed groups and those given 5 and 10 ml formalin (3%) into the crop were not significantly different from control. Administration of 15 and 20 ml formalin (3%) into crop resulted in depression, delayed onset of crowing, significantly decreased feed intake, lower body mass, decreased mass and volume of testes, ulceration in crops, sloughing of mucosa and petechial haemorrhages in proventriculus. All the groups given formalin had significantly smaller diameters of seminiferous tubules. Kidneys of the birds administered formalin into crop exhibited pyknotic nuclei of epithelial cells in proximal tubules. Non-significant differences in different parameters and lesser degree of pathological changes in birds given formalin-mixed feed than their corresponding crop-administered groups suggested that formalin present in the feed had partially evaporated. Therefore, birds ingested less amount of formalin than that originally mixed in the feed.
The most common adverse effects associated with the use of benzodiazepine hypnotics are residual daytime effects (daytime sedation and daytime performance decrements), anterograde amnesia, and rebound insomnia. Studies show that these adverse effects are related to dose. Hence, benzodiazepine hypnotics should be used in low doses so as to minimize or prevent these common adverse effects. It is now generally accepted that benzodiazepines should not be administered long-term for the treatment of chronic "idiopathic" insomnia. Two noncontinuous sleep disturbances, insomnia in the elderly and transient insomnia in young and middle-aged adults, are probably the most acceptable indications for the use of benzodiazepines. Low doses of short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines (triazolam and temazepam) are efficacious in the treatment of insomnia in the elderly, and preliminary evidence suggests that they are efficacious in the treatment of transient insomnia in young and middle-aged adults.
Prior studies demonstrate that NMDA receptor antagonists attenuate cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality. Since glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter for NMDA receptors, pharmacological interventions to lower glutamatergic activity through non-NMDA ionotropic receptor-mediated mechanisms were evaluated for their ability to prevent the convulsive and lethal effects of cocaine. Pre-treatment of male, Swiss Webster mice with the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor antagonists 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2, 3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX; 10-80 mg/kg, i.p.) or 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2, 3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466; 10-20 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to significantly attenuate cocaine-induced convulsions or lethality. Although ineffective when administered alone, NBQX enhanced the protective effects of 5-nitro-6,7-dichloro-1, 4-dihydro-2,3-quinoxalinedione (ACEA-1021), an NMDA/glycine site antagonist, when administered in combination. The mixed NMDA/non-NMDA receptor competitive antagonist 5-chloro-7-trifluoromethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (ACEA-1011) also protected against the convulsive effects of cocaine. The data suggest that AMPA/kainate receptors indirectly influence the pathophysiological changes that occur after a cocaine overdose through modulation of NMDA receptors.
Aspirin enjoys widespread use as an antithrombotic drug, but such ubiquity also increases the risk of gastrointestinal mucosal injury. Recent studies have shown that aspirin can also induce esophageal mucosal injury. We resolved to determine the intragastric pH value necessary to prevent aspirin-induced esophageal mucosal injury.
15 healthy Japanese volunteers were dosed for 7 days in a four-way random crossover trial with 100 mg entero-coated type aspirin only once daily, 100 mg aspirin + 20 mg famotidine twice daily, 15 mg lansoprazole once daily, or 10 mg rabeprazole once daily. All subjects underwent endoscopy and intragastric pH monitoring on day 7.
7 individuals (46.7%) developed esophageal mucosal injury when ingesting aspirin alone. The incidence of esophageal mucosal injury was reduced however with concomitant dosing of aspirin and famotidine (26.6%; p = 0.193), lansoprazole (0%; p = 0.004), and rabeprazole (6.7%; p = 0.019). Among individuals for whom mean 24-h pH was >5.0 and who experienced pH <4.0 less than 40% of the time, none developed aspirin-induced esophageal mucosal injury.
Acid inhibition achieved with a half-dose of a proton pump inhibitor effectively prevented development of aspirin-induced esophageal mucosal injury, whereas a standard dose of a histamine-2-receptor antagonist failed to achieve the same results.
