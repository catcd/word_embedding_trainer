The calcium antagonist nisoldipine has recently been reported to induce rather than to attenuate ischaemia in some patients with stable angina. The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying this proischaemic effect.
In 20 anaesthetised dogs systemic haemodynamic variables, regional myocardial blood flow (coloured microspheres), and systolic wall thickening (sonomicrometry) were measured during control conditions and following severe stenosis on the left circumflex coronary artery, before and after intravenous administration of equihypotensive doses of either nisoldipine (group I, n = 10) or dipyridamole (group II, n = 10). Finally, measurements were performed while the drug induced decreases in mean aortic pressure--18 (SD 6) mmHg in group I and 14(6) mm Hg in group II--were reversed by inflation of an intra-aortic balloon.
The stenosis decreased posterior wall thickening to 50% of control, and posterior subendocardial blood flow from 1.48(0.27) to 0.61(0.19) ml.min-1.g-1 in group I and from 1.49(0.23) to 0.62(0.18) ml.min-1.g-1 in group II. Subendocardial blood flow was further decreased after administration of either nisoldipine [0.37(0.20) ml.min-1.g-1, p < 0.05 v stenosis] or dipyridamole [0.22(0.11) ml.min-1.g-1, p < 0.05 v stenosis]. Regional myocardial blood flow in the anterior region was increased. The drug induced reduction of subendocardial blood flow decreased posterior wall thickening further from 9.3(2.1) to 6.2(3.9)% (p < 0.05 v stenosis, group I) and from 9.1(1.7) to 4.3(2.4)% (p < 0.05 v stenosis, group II). When the drug induced decrease in aortic pressure was reversed, subendocardial blood flow again increased in group I [0.63(0.19) ml.min-1.g-1, p < 0.05 v stenosis and nisoldipine] whereas in group II it remained decreased [0.40(0.29) ml.min-1.g-1, NS v stenosis and dipyridamole]. There was restoration of posterior wall thickening in group I [10.4(3.8)%, p < 0.05 v stenosis and nisoldipine], but not in group II [5.2(3.5)%, NS v stenosis and dipyridamole].
Nisoldipine and dipyridamole decrease subendocardial blood flow and contractile function distal to a severe stenosis when aortic pressure is decreased. No aggravation of ischaemia by nisoldipine is seen when hypotension is prevented. In contrast, dipyridamole in the absence of hypotension still induces a redistribution of flow at the expense of the ischaemic region.
Single dose of propranolol hydrochloride (5 mg/kg, i.p.) caused significant fall in heart rate (HR) but not in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in normotensive conscious rats. Multiple doses of propranolol (5 mg/kg, i.p., twice-a-day for 5 wk) caused significant fall in both HR and SBP at 2 wk and 4 wk in normotensive conscious rats. Sudden withdrawal of propranolol at 5 wk caused a significant blood pressure upswing and tachycardia between 12-24 h followed by normalization of both blood pressure and heart rate. The study documents a possible model of rebound hypertension in normotensive conscious rats.
Thiazolidinediones (TZD) can cause adipose tissue accumulation and myocardial hypertrophy. This study aimed to determine if combined Metformin (Glucophage) and Rosiglitazone (Avandia) could reduce the risk of heart failure caused by Rosiglitazone in BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice were treated with oral Rosiglitazone/Metformin twice daily for four weeks. Metformin or Rosiglitazone alone and non-treated mice acted as double control. Myocardial hypertrophy and associated side effects of the combined therapy were determined through isolated heart and body weights. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were applied to evaluate expression of sulfonylurea receptor 2A (SUR2A) and Kir 6.2. The activities of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) in the myocardium were also observed. Rosiglitazone/Metformin decreased body weight gain and food intake, and inhibited an increasing adipose ratio but did not reduce myocardial hypertrophy. Rosiglitazone increased Kir6.2/SUR2A, Kir6.2/SUR2B, and PPARalpha gene expression. The Rosiglitazone/Metformin combination further increased these gene expressions, especially PPARalpha. Metformin inhibits obesity but has no effect in reducing myocardial hypertrophy caused by Rosiglitazone. Whether Metformin can reduce side effects of TZDs in humans warrants further study.
Twenty-three patients with stage III germinal neoplasia of the testis were treated with a variation of our original vinblastine-bleomycin program. This modification consisted of 0.4 mg/kg of vinblastine given in two fractions on Days 1 and 2 followed by continuous intravenous administration of 30 units of bleomycin in 1000 cc of 5% glucose and distilled water over a 24-hour period for 5 successive days beginning on Day 2. Therapy was repeated every 28-35 days as toxicity permitted. There were 17 responses, nine of which were complete (39%). Eight of the complete responses were in patients with massive disease in whom a low complete response rate was expected. Toxic effects consisted of severe leukopenia in 90% thrombopenia in 50%, and unexplained transient hyperbilirubinemia in about 30% of the patients. Bleomycin pneumonitis occurred in one patient and resulted in death. Hypertension was a new and unexpected side reaction experienced by four patients. Further trials are indicated since the complete response rate in patients with advanced massive disease appears to be improved.
Effects of felodipine, the calcium channel blocker, on the electroshock, pentetrazole-, aminophylline-, and pilocarpine-induced seizures and on the anticonvulsant activity of different antiepileptic drugs against maximal electroshock were examined in mice. Felodipine increased the threshold for electroconvulsions. The drug exerted also a protective effect against pentetrazole-induced seizures, but not against aminophylline- and pilocarpine-induced seizures. The protective efficacy of diazepam and diphenylhydantoin (but not phenobarbital and valproate) against electroconvulsions was significantly enhanced by felodipine. A pharmacokinetic interaction did not seem to be responsible for the interaction of felodipine with antiepileptic drugs in the maximal electroshock test.
We report a case of grand mal convulsion due to inadvertent intravascular injection of ropivacaine. An 83-year-old woman was scheduled for upper limb surgery. The interscalene block was performed with neurostimulator and 0.5% ropivacaine 30 ml was injected after careful negative aspiration. Approximately 3 min after the injection, the patient lost consciousness and developed generalized convulsion, which was repeated 7 times. The seizures stopped after administration of diazepam 10 mg and thiamylal 250 mg i.v. Trachea was intubated and lungs were mechanically ventilated. During the seizure, arterial blood pressure increased from 180/110 mmHg to 190/120 mmHg and heart rate changed from 90 beats x min(-1) to 88 beats x min(-1). Ventricular premature beats were observed sporadically but stopped spontaneously. After the episode, the operation was performed under general anesthesia (nitrous oxide 50% and sevoflurane 1.5-2% in oxygen 50%). The patient recovered uneventfully after the operation. Although careful aspiration was done before the injection of ropivacaine, inadvertent intravenous injection could have occurred during the administration. Intermittent aspiration should be indispensable during the administration, because a large dose of local anesthetic is necessary for interscalene block. In this case, the only cardiovascular manifestation was ventricular premature beats indicating that ropivacaine has less cardiotoxicity.
An increasing number of cases of allergic contact dermatitis secondary to formaldehyde resins used for textile finishes have been seen in our office over the last several years. Although previously reported to be more common in women, we have seen almost as many men as we have seen women with this condition, possibly because men are more likely to be occupationally sensitized to formaldehyde. We have found that patch-test reactions of only questionable strength may be clinically relevant. It has been our experience that many of these cases are of long duration before referral for patch testing. A low index of suspicion leads to a delayed diagnosis, and avoidance after diagnosis is difficult owing to the lack of labeling requirements for textile finishes. Patch testing with the textile resins Fixapret AC and Fixapret CPN most often identified patients with textile allergies. We have prepared a handout to give patients more definitive recommendations.
Noninvasive methods for the early detection of tumor onset and progression in rodent liver would be of high value for pharmaceutical and chemical industry and would, at the same time, foster one of the 3 Rs (replacement, reduction, refinement) by reducing the number of animals in the bioassay. We have induced liver tumors in mice by single injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) either in 2-week- (experiment 1) or 6-week-old (experiment 2) male C3H mice. In the latter, mice were also chronically treated with 0.05% phenobarbital in diet according to an initiation/promotion protocol. Starting at 16 weeks after DEN injection (18 weeks after DEN in experiment 2), mice were routinely scanned by noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a T2-weighted 3D sequence in regular intervals. Liver tumors became detectable in both experiments when they exceeded a diameter of ∼1 mm. Exponential increases in total tumor volume per liver were observed in both experiments. The onset of tumor development was similar with respect to DEN treatment. Although mice in experiment 1 had developed a mean total tumor volume of ∼100 mm³ approximately 24 weeks after DEN, it took ∼4 weeks longer to reach this tumor mass in experiment 2. Determination of time-dependent growth of individual tumors demonstrated strong tumor heterogeneity. In vivo MRI data were further correlated with tumor histology. The phenotype of tumors differed strongly between the two experiments, but our results demonstrate that tumors can be reliably detected by MRI when they exceed a certain size independent of their phenotype.
The common mycotoxin ochratoxin-A (OTA) accumulates in brain, causes oxidative stress, and elicits a DNA repair response that varies across brain regions and neuronal populations. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) prepared from hippocampus of adult mouse brain were tested for their vulnerability to the toxin in vitro. The following measurements were made in NSC cell cultures in both proliferation and differentiation media: (1) viability (trypan blue exclusion), (2) proliferative activity ([(3)H]-thymidine uptake), (3) the DNA repair response (oxyguanosine glycosylase activity), and (4) antioxidative response (superoxide dismutase). Cells that had proliferated to 90-100% confluency in the presence of epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor were induced to differentiate by removal of the growth factors. OTA, added to the cultures in concentrations of 0.01-100 microg/ml, caused a dose- and time-dependent (6-72 h) decrease in viability of both proliferating and differentiating NSC. Proliferating NSC exhibited a greater vulnerability to the toxin than differentiated neurons despite robust DNA repair and antioxidative responses. Preconditioning of NSC with a 12-h incubation with the pro-oxidant diethyl maleate increased DNA repair activity and, subsequently, provided a moderate degree of neuroprotection. Overall, these results lead to speculation that OTA exposure may contribute to impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo, resulting in depression and memory deficits, conditions reported to be linked to mycotoxin exposure in humans.
D-penicillamine (DP) and gold salts which are used as immune-modulating agents in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are known to be capable of causing autoimmune manifestations. Most autoimmune diseases in man are dominated by Th1-type responses, and one might presume that effective immunotherapy counteracts Th activity, perhaps by causing a shift to a Th2 response. The mechanism of action of gold and DP is not clear, but some clues may be obtained from their effects in animal models. DP, gold salts and mercuric chloride (HgCl2) are known to induce Th2-dominated autoimmune syndromes in genetically susceptible rodent strains, and we have demonstrated recently that HgCl2 up-regulates messenger RNA (mRNA) for IL-4 in the Brown Norway (BN) rat. In the BN rat HgCl2 treatment is also associated with the development of vasculitis, and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies are found in the serum. The present study examined and confirmed the hypothesis that, since gold and DP induce an autoimmune syndrome similar to HgCl2 in the BN rat, they may also induce vasculitis and an up-regulation in mRNA for IL-4. Tissue injury was assessed macroscopically and histologically on day 5 and day 15 after the start of injections with gold, DP or HgCl2, serum titres of IgE and presence of anti-MPO antibodies were determined using ELISA, and a semi-quantitative assay using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to assay the level of mRNA for IL-4 in spleen and caecum. The relative degree of tissue injury reflected the potency of induction of IgE by the three agents (HgCl2 being most potent and DP least potent). The lesions were identical histologically, supporting the premise that the vasculitis is a manifestation of the autoimmune syndrome rather than non-specific HgCl2 toxicity. Both gold and DP induced less up-regulation of mRNA for IL-4 than HgCl2. HgCl2 (but not gold or DP) induced anti-MPO antibodies. It would be interesting to examine patients treated with gold and DP to see if there is evidence of a Th2-type response in those developing autoimmune complications, and whether or not the bias to a Th2 environment contributes to efficacy of treatment of the underlying disease.
Anethole trithione, a choleretic, has been reported to be effective in the treatment of dry mouth. We have examined the effects of chronic treatment with anethole trithione on salivary secretion, substance P immunoreactive substance (SP-IS) and alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive substance (alpha-CGRP-IS) concentrations in human saliva. Anethole trithione caused significant increases of saliva SP-IS concentrations from the day 13 (25.3 +/- 1.6 pg mL(-1)) to day 14 (25.8 +/- 1.7 pg mL(-1)) compared with day 1 (19.9 +/- 1.9 pg mL(-1)). Anethole trithione caused significant increase in saliva alpha-CGRP-IS concentration on day 14 (39.9 +/- 4.7 pg mL(-1)) compared with day 1 (27.7 +/- 4.7 pg mL(-1)). Anethole trithione significantly increased the sialosis volumes from day 11 to day 14 (1.6 +/- 0.1-1.7 +/- 0.2 mL) compared with the day 1 (1.2 +/- 0.2 mL). Simple linear regression of the increase in sialosis volume with saliva SP-IS (r = 0.94) and alpha-CGRP-IS (r = 0.97) concentrations was found. These results demonstrated that chronic treatment with anethole trithione affected saliva SP-IS and alpha-CGRP-IS concentration in human saliva and sialosis volume.
A reasonably sensitive and specific noninvasive test for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is needed. In addition, few data exist on the short- and long-term effects of doxorubicin on diastolic filling. To determine if pulsed Doppler indexes of diastolic filling could predict doxorubicin-induced systolic dysfunction, 26 patients (mean age 48 +/- 12 years) were prospectively studied before receiving chemotherapy (control) and 3 weeks after obtaining cumulative doses of doxorubicin. In nine patients developing doxorubicin-induced systolic dysfunction (that is, a decrease in ejection fraction by greater than or equal to 10 ejection fraction units to less than 55%), the isovolumetric relaxation time was prolonged (from 66 +/- 18 to 84 +/- 24 ms, p less than 0.05) after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 100 to 120 mg/m2. This prolongation preceded a significant decrease in ejection fraction. Other Doppler indexes of filling were impaired after doxorubicin therapy but occurred simultaneously with the decrease in ejection fraction. A greater than 37% increase in isovolumetric relaxation time was 78% (7 of 9) sensitive and 88% (15 of 17) specific for predicting the ultimate development of doxorubicin-induced systolic dysfunction. In 15 patients studied 1 h after the first treatment, doxorubicin enhanced Doppler indexes of filling and shortened isovolumetric relaxation time. In 22 patients, indexes of filling remained impaired and isovolumetric relaxation time was prolonged 3 months after the last doxorubicin dose. In conclusion, doxorubicin-induced systolic dysfunction is reliably predicted by prolongation of Doppler-derived isovolumetric relaxation time. Early after administration, doxorubicin enhances filling and isovolumetric relaxation time. The adverse effects of doxorubicin on both variables persist at least 3 months after cessation of treatment.
We report a new case of myocardiotoxicity due to 5 fluorouracil. A patient shows immediately after the first cure of chemotherapy where 5 fluorouracil was associated with cisplatinum, a circulatory failure which will need a controlled ventilation and a catecholamine treatment. Right catheterization and two-D echocardiography will confirm the alteration of myocardial contractility. The patient condition will favorably and quickly evolve towards normalisation of the cardiac examination at the third week.
We report a case of prolonged fever, agranulocytosis, and anaemia associated with the long acting sulphametopyrazine-trimethoprim combination (Kelfiprim). A woman of 23 years took an overdose of 13 tablets over five days for presumed cystitis. One day after the last dose the patient developed fever and a generalised rash. The fever persisted and her previously normal leukocyte count decreased to 1.8 x 10(9)/1. After treatment with paracetamol the fever settled briefly, and then recurred for another 16 days. A later peripheral blood leukocyte count of 0.77 x 10(9)/1, haemoglobin of 10.8 g/dl, and a hypocellular bone marrow with depressed granulopoiesis and haemopoiesis suggested marrow suppression induced by sulfametopyrazine. Since the IgM antibody against the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen was detected, the adverse drug reaction might have been aggravated by this virus. The case highlights the risk of severe haematological adverse reactions associated with sulphonamide treatment, and argues for the use of trimethoprim alone for uncomplicated cystitis.
Epidemiological findings suggest an association between exposure to particulate matter (PM) and venous thrombo-embolism.
  To investigate arterial vs. venous thrombosis, inflammation and coagulation in mice, (sub)acutely exposed to two types of PM.
Various doses (25, 100 and 200 μg per animal) of urban particulate matter (UPM) or diesel exhaust particles (DEP) were intratracheally (i.t.) instilled in C57Bl6/n mice and several endpoints measured at 4, 10 and 24 h. Mice were also repeatedly exposed to 100 μg per animal on three consecutive days with endpoints measured 24 h after the last instillation.
Exposure to 200 μg per mouse UPM enhanced arterial thrombosis, but neither UPM nor DEP significantly enhanced venous thrombosis. Both types of PM induced dose-dependent increases in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) total cell numbers (mainly neutrophils) and cytokines (IL-6, KC, MCP-1, RANTES, MIP-1α), with peaks at 4 h and overall higher values for UPM than for DEP. Systemic inflammation was limited to increased serum IL-6 levels, 4 h after UPM. Both types of PM induced similar and dose-dependent but modest increases in factor (F)VII, FVIII and fibrinogen. Three repeated instillations did not or only modestly enhance the proinflammatory and procoagulant status.
Compared with DEP, UPM induced more pronounced pulmonary inflammation, but both particle types triggered similar and mild short-term systemic effects. Hence, acute exposure to PM triggers activation of primary hemostasis in the mouse, but no substantial secondary hemostasis activation, resulting in arterial but not venous thrombogenicity.
High invasiveness of glioma cells is one of the reasons that patients with malignant glioma have a poor prognosis. Resveratrol, a plant compound abundant in the peel of grapes, has been suggested as a potential cancer chemopreventive agent. Therefore, we investigated the effect of resveratrol on glioma cell invasion.
The effect of resveratrol on U373MG human glioma cell invasion was assessed by Matrigel assay and methylthiazoltetrazolium assay. Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were performed to elucidate the action mechanism of resveratrol.
Resveratrol reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced U373MG human glioma cell invasion. In addition, resveratrol repressed nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation and down-regulated mRNA expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor in TNF-α-treated glioma cells.
These findings suggest that resveratrol could prevent glioma cell invasion via inhibiting proteolysis of extracellular matrix.
Bepridil and amiodarone are known to have a multiple ion channel-blocking property in the heart. In this study, we compared the effects of bepridil on beat-to-beat variability of repolarization, a new predictive marker of torsades de pointes arrhythmia, with those of amiodarone. Bepridil (30 mg/kg, n=4) or amiodarone (200 mg/day for initial 7 days and 100 mg/day for following 21 days, n=4) was orally administered to chronic atrioventricular block dogs under the Holter ECG monitoring. The QT interval was prolonged after the administration of bepridil and amiodarone, and torsades de pointes arrhythmia was induced in 3 out of 4 dogs after the bepridil administration, which was not observed during the chronic administration of amiodarone. Beat-to-beat variability of repolarization, quantified as the short-term variability of the QT interval, increased after the administration of bepridil by +3.0 ms, whereas no significant change was detected in this parameter after the administration of amiodarone. These results suggest that the beat-to-beat variability of repolarization is a useful marker for differentiating the extent of torsadogenic potential of multi ion channel-blockers bepridil and amiodarone.
Because of unsatisfactory treatment options for prostate cancer (CaP) there is a need to develop novel preventive approaches for this malignancy. One such strategy is through chemoprevention by the use of non-toxic dietary substances and botanical products. We have shown previously that panduratin A isolated from the extract of Kaempferia pandurata (Zingiberaceae) is a strong inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 in RAW264.7 cells and induces apoptosis in HT-29 cells. In the present study, we provide evidence that panduratin A treatment to androgen-independent human CaP cells PC3 and DU145 result in a time and dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth with an IC50 of 13.5-14 microM and no to little effect on normal human prostate epithelial cells. To define the mechanism of these anti-proliferative effects of panduratin A, we determined its effect on critical molecular events known to regulate the cell cycle and the apoptotic machinery. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining provided the evidence for the induction of apoptosis which was further confirmed by the observation of cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and degradation of acinus. Panduratin A treatment to cells was found to result in inhibition of procaspases 9, 8, 6 and 3 with significant increase in the ratio of Bax:Bcl-2, suggesting the involvement of a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. Panduratin A-mediated apoptosis was accompanied with upregulation of Fas death receptor and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Furthermore, cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry showed that panduratin A treatment of cells resulted in a G2/M arrest in a dose-dependent manner. The immunoblot analysis data revealed that in both cell lines panduratin A treatment resulted in a dose-dependent (i) induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1, (ii) downregulation of cdks 2, 4 and 6 and (iii) decrease in cyclins D1 and E. These findings suggest that panduratin A may be an effective chemopreventive or therapeutic agent against CaP.
We have examined the cerebrovascular response to carbon dioxide during normotension, sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced hypotension and high dose isoflurane-induced hypotension in 10 patients who received a standardized general anaesthetic. Carbon dioxide reactivity was determined by varying PaCO2 between 3.0 and 8.0 kPa and recording simultaneously blood flow velocity from the middle cerebral artery (vmca). The paired vmca-PaCO2 data were analysed using linear regression to determine carbon dioxide reactivity. During hypotension, both high-dose isoflurane and SNP reduced significantly mean absolute (from 17.4 (SEM 2.3) to 13.0 (1.7) and 8.8 (1.3) cm s-1 kPa-1, respectively; P < 0.05) and relative (from 32.5 (3.8) to 23.6 (2.0) and 15.5 (1.3)% kPa-1, respectively; P < 0.05) cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide. This reduction was greater during SNP-induced hypotension (P < 0.05). We conclude that cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide was attenuated during isoflurane and SNP-induced hypotension, and that it was better preserved during isoflurane-induced hypotension.
Experimental evidence is presented that activation of beta 2 adrenoreceptors causes a dose-dependent decrease in plasma potassium, probably by shifting potassium into the cell. By this mechanism epinephrine may cause hypokalemia and predispose to cardiac arrhythmias. Prevention of these effects by nonselective beta blockers may contribute to the cardioprotective action of these drugs.
The present study investigates the effect of aspartate and glutamate on mitochondrial function during myocardial infarction (MI) in wistar rats. Male albino wistar rats were pretreated with aspartate [100 mg(kgbody weight)(-1) day(-1)] or glutamate [100 mg(kg body weight)(-1) day(-1)] intraperitoneally for a period of 7 days. Following amino acid treatment, MI was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol [200 mg(kg body weight)(-1) day(-1)] for 2 days at an interval of 24 h. Isoproterenol (ISO) induction resulting in significant (P<0.05) increase in the levels of cardiac mitochondrial lipid peroxidation with a decrease in reduced glutathione level. The activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were significantly (P<0.05) decreased by ISO. ISO-induction also caused significant (P<0.05) decrease in the activities of mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes (malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) and respiratory chain enzymes (NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c-oxidase). ISO significantly (P<0.05) reduced the cytochrome contents, ATP production, ADP/O ratio and oxidation of succinate in state 3/state 4 whereas significantly (P<0.05) increased NADH oxidation. Pretreatment with aspartate or glutamate significantly (P<0.05) reduced the alterations induced by ISO and maintained normal mitochondrial function. The present findings reveal the protective effect of aspartate and glutamate on cardiac mitochondrial function in myocardial infarction-induced rats.
Dosing-time-dependent changes in the effect and toxicity of morphine were examined in mice housed under alternating 12 h light (07:00 to 19:00 h) and dark (19:00 to 07:00 h) cycles. Morphine (0.5 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) in animals to assess its beneficial effect (i.e., protection against the kaolin-induced, bradykinin-mediated, writhing reaction) and its toxicity (i.e., alteration of the hepatic enzymes of aspartate aminotransferase [AST] alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and glutathione [GSH] in separate experiments). The magnitude of the analgesic effect of morphine depended on dosing time, with minimum effect at 02:00 h and maximum effect at 14:00 h. The serum hepatic enzyme levels of AST and ALT increased after dosing morphine (100 mg/kg) at 02:00 and 14:00 h. Time courses of these enzymes did not differ between the two trials. However, hepatic GSH, which is involved in the detoxification of chemical compounds, significantly decreased after i.p. morphine injection at 02:00 but not at 14:00 h. Overall, the results suggest that the analgesic effect of morphine is greater after dosing during the resting than during the activity phase of mice that have been induced with bradykinin-mediated pain. Drug-induced hepatic damage as inferred by GSH alteration, however, may be greater after dosing during the active phase.
The monoamine content in cerebral structures has been related to neuronal excitability and several approaches have been used to study this phenomenon during seizure vulnerability. In the present work, we have described the effects of serotonin (5-HT) depletion after the administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) into the median raphe nucleus in rats submitted to the pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus as well as the spontaneous seizure frequency during the chronic period of the model was determined. Since the hippocampus is one of the main structures in the development of this epilepsy model, the 5-HT levels in this region were also determined after drug administration. Sixty-three percent of 5,7-DHT pre-treated rats (15/24) and only 33.4% of those receiving the control solution (9/24) progressed to motor limbic seizures evolving to status epilepticus, following the administration of pilocarpine. The frequency of seizures during the chronic period, in epileptic rats that received 5,7-DHT, showed a significant (58%) increase after the treatment, when compared with control group. Our data showed that serotonin may play an important role on seizure activity which seems to be exerted by its inhibitory action on the expression of overt behavior seizures departing from an established focus in the limbic system.
Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD) are lethal hereditary diseases caused by abnormalities in the biogenesis of peroxisomes. At present, 12 different complementation groups have been identified and to date, all genes responsible for each of these complementation groups have been identified. The peroxisomal membrane protein PEX14 is a key component of the peroxisomal import machinery and may be the initial docking site for the two import receptors PEX5 and PEX7. Although PEX14 mutants have been identified in yeasts and CHO-cells, human PEX14 deficiency has apparently not been documented. We now report the identification of a new complementation group of the peroxisome biogenesis disorders with PEX14 as the defective gene. Indeed, human PEX14 rescues the import of a PTS1-dependent as well as a PTS2-dependent protein into the peroxisomes in fibroblasts from a patient with Zellweger syndrome belonging to the new complementation group. This patient was homozygous for a nonsense mutation in a putative coiled-coil region of PEX14, c.553C>T (p.Q185X). Furthermore, we showed that the patient's fibroblasts lacked PEX14 as determined by immunocytochemical analysis. These findings indicate that there are 13 genotypes in PBD and that the role of PEX14 is also essential in humans.
