We used a mixed group/single-case, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ABAB design to examine the safety and efficacy of the glutamate antagonist dextromethorphan for the treatment of problematic behaviors and core symptoms in eight children diagnosed with autism. All participants had increased levels of irritability at baseline as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, and demonstrated a wide variety of problematic behaviors. Group analyses revealed that dextromethorphan was equivalent to placebo in the treatment of problem behaviors and core symptoms. Analyses at the single-subject level demonstrated that three of the eight participants who had a behavioral profile consistent with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder responded positively to dextromethorphan. Future research that employs a larger, more homogeneous sample is necessary to replicate the findings from this study.
A case of acute cholestatic hepatitis associated with use of antiplatelet agent ticlopidine is reported. Hepatitis developed 3 weeks after the beginning of the drug in a 72 year old man submitted to coronary angioplasty and stent implantation for unstable angina. The close time relationship between the administration of this antiplatelet drug and the acute onset of liver damage, the exclusion of other hepatobiliary disease and the progressive normalisation of biochemical parameters following withdrawal of the drug strongly suggest that ticlopidine was involved in the pathogenesis of this syndrome.
Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a form of acute kidney injury and a significant source of morbidity and mortality. We defined CIN as an increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of 25% or more within 48 hours of receiving contrast. We retrospectively compared sodium bicarbonate with normal saline for prevention of CIN. One hundred and eighty-seven patients exposed to contrast during cardiac angiography, treated prophylactically either with sodium bicarbonate (n = 89) or with normal saline (n = 98), were studied. Baseline characteristics of both groups were similar in terms of age, amount of contrast, presence of diabetes mellitus, and use of furosemide and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Patients in bicarbonate group had more severe renal disease with higher baseline SCr (1.58 +/- 0.5 mg/dL vs. 1.28 +/- 0.3 mg/dL, p = 0.001) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, 51.06 +/- 14.0 mL/min vs. 62.3+/-13.5 mL/min, p = 0.001) compared to the normal saline group. After the contrast exposure, there was significant drop in eGFR (6.4%) and increase in SCr (11.3%) in the normal saline group and no significant change in the bicarbonate group. Three patients (3.4%) in the bicarbonate group as opposed to 14 patients (14.3%) in the normal saline group developed CIN (p = 0.011). Two patients in the normal saline group and none in the bicarbonate group needed dialysis. There was no significant difference in serum creatinine at three-month follow-up in either group. The above findings suggest that hydration with intravenous sodium bicarbonate is more effective than normal saline in preventing contrast-induced nephropathy.
Transplantation of fetal cardiomyocytes has been shown to improve function of regionally infarcted myocardium, but its effects on global heart failure are still unknown.
Heart failure was induced in female mice by intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (2 mg/kg twice per week over 2 cycles of 2 weeks separated by a 2-week drug-free period). One week after the end of treatment, left ventricular function was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (baseline). Animals were then randomized into 3 groups: The treated group (n = 12) received an intramyocardial injection of fetal cardiomyocytes (1 x 10(6) in 10 microL) harvested from transgenic mice expressing the gene of beta-galactosidase, the control group (n = 15) received an equivalent volume of culture medium alone, and 10 sham mice had no surgery. Two weeks and 1 month after transplantation, function was again assessed echocardiographically. At baseline, fractional shortening was not significantly different between the 3 groups. It then significantly increased in cell-treated mice at 2 weeks and 1 month after transplantation (P < 0.002 and P < 0.03 versus baseline, respectively), whereas it did not change in untreated animals. Transplanted cells could not be identified by beta-galactosidase activity or presence of Y chromosome (with 1 exception).
Cellular transplantation can improve function of globally failing hearts by a mechanism that might not necessarily involve the sustained presence of transplanted cells but rather the effects of cardioprotective factors released by them.
1. Cyclophosphamide (CYP) (150 mg kg-1, i.p. 0.5-48 h before) caused a time-dependent plasma protein extravasation in the rat urinary bladder with the maximal extravasation occurring at between 2 and 4 h after administration of the drug. 2. Prior capsaicin desensitization of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent neurones (CSPANs) (50 mg kg-1, s.c., 4 days before) resulted in approximately 50% inhibition of the magnitude of the extravasation response at the 2 h time-point. 3. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) pretreatment with the tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, RP 67,580 (0.44 mg kg-1) or the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (0.13 mg kg-1) had significant inhibitory effects, giving responses of 56 +/- 6% and 39 +/- 4% of the control extravasation response to CYP treatment after 2 h. Pretreatment with the tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist, SR 48,968 (0.3 mg kg-1, i.p.), the histamine H1 receptor blocker, chlorpheniramine (10 mg kg-1, i.p.), the 5-HT receptor blocker, methysergide (6 mg kg-1, i.p.) or the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (5 mg kg-1, i.p.) had no significant effect upon the development of the extravasation response at this same time-point. 4. In rat isolated urinary bladder strips, the active metabolite of CYP, acrolein (1-300 microM) produced a concentration-dependent contraction that was significantly reduced by in vitro capsaicin desensitization (10 microM for 15 min) indicating direct stimulation of CSPANs. CYP was without appreciable effect. 5. The effect of acrolein in vitro was significantly reduced by pretreatment of the bladder with a combination of tachykinin NK1 and NK2 receptor antagonists, RP 67,580 (3 microM) and SR 48,968 (1 microM). The dose-response curve to acrolein was also significantly inhibited by treatment with indomethacin (10 microM) and slightly affected by Hoe 140 (1 microM). 6. These findings demonstrate the contribution of CSPANs to the development of CYP-induced cystitis.Plasma protein extravasation involves activation of tachykinin NKI and bradykinin B2 receptors.Activation of CSPANs in the urinary bladder is likely to be due to the conversion of CYP into its active metabolite, acrolein, and not to a direct effect of CYP upon these nerve-endings.
To evaluate the influence of adjuvant tamoxifen and exemestane on cognitive functioning in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer (BC).
Neuropsychological assessments were performed before the start (T1) and after 1 year of adjuvant endocrine treatment (T2) in Dutch postmenopausal patients with BC, who did not receive chemotherapy. Patients participated in the international Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational trial, a prospective randomized study investigating tamoxifen versus exemestane as adjuvant therapy for hormone-sensitive BC.
Participants included 80 tamoxifen users (mean age, 68.7 years; range 51 to 84), 99 exemestane users (mean age, 68.3 years; range, 50 to 82), and 120 healthy controls (mean age, 66.2 years; range, 49 to 86). At T2, after adjustment for T1 performance, exemestane users did not perform statistically significantly worse than healthy controls on any cognitive domain. In contrast, tamoxifen users performed statistically significantly worse than healthy controls on verbal memory (P < .01; Cohen's d = .43) and executive functioning (P = .01; Cohen's d = .40), and statistically significantly worse than exemestane users on information processing speed (P = .02; Cohen's d = .36). With respect to visual memory, working memory, verbal fluency, reaction speed, and motor speed, no significant differences between the three groups were found.
After 1 year of adjuvant therapy, tamoxifen use is associated with statistically significant lower functioning in verbal memory and executive functioning, whereas exemestane use is not associated with statistically significant lower cognitive functioning in postmenopausal patients with BC. Our results accentuate the need to include assessments of cognitive effects of adjuvant endocrine treatment in long-term safety studies.
A post-marketing surveillance study of Euhypnos (temazepam), a new short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic. A total of 12,350 patients requiring a sleep inducer were treated for up to 3 months with doses of 10-30 mg at night. After 2 weeks 80% of First Reports (FRs) rated Euhypnos effective and at 3 months this had risen to 92% of 3062 Second Reports (SRs). Hangover was reported in 7% of FRs and 2% of SRs but in general the drug was well tolerated with adverse reactions consisting mainly of morning nausea, headache, drowsiness and vivid dreaming. Eighty-seven per cent of FRs and 93% of SRs were 'Clean' reporting no hangover, adverse reaction or event of any kind.
The synthetic peptide consisting of amino acid residues 106-126 of the human prion protein PrP106-126 has been demonstrated to generate fibrils, which damage neurons either directly by interacting with components of the cell surface to trigger cell apoptosis signaling or indirectly by activating microglia to produce inflammatory mediators. In our study, rat microglia cells were treated with PrP106-126 or scramble PrP106-126 (Scr PrP). Activated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) was determined using immunofluorescence staining and the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Inhibitory activity of aspirin on neurotoxicity of PrP106-126 associated with microglia activation was determined using an apoptosis detection kit. Treatment of microglia with 25 microM PrP106-126, but not Scr PrP, resulted in activation and translocation of NF-kappaB, which peaked after 20 min of treatment. The activation of NF-kappaB was followed by increased mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta peaking at about 20 h. In the presence of microglia, aspirin significantly inhibited neuro-2a cell death induced by PrP106-126. The number of neuro-2a cells in apoptosis and necrosis with 5 mM aspirin was about 3-fold lower than the cell culture without aspirin (P<0.05). These data suggest that increased production of cytokines by microglia cells in prion disease is probably regulated by NF-kappaB translocation and may contribute to neurotoxicity of prions, and neurotoxicity of PrP106-126 may be inhibited by aspirin.
BILN 2061 is a potent, reversible inhibitor of hepatitis C virus NS3/NS4A serine protease. Early clinical proof of principle with the drug was offset by the results of subsequent safety studies in Rhesus monkeys revealing cardiotoxicity that featured myocardial vacuolation corresponding to mitochondrial swelling. Here we describe an investigation into the nature, onset, and reversibility of the lesion, and an assessment of potentially predictive biomarkers for the change. Rhesus monkeys were orally administered 1,000 mg/kg/day BILN 2061 and either necropsied after one, three, fourteen, or twenty-eight doses or afforded a ten-week recovery period. The results of electrocardiographic and plasma troponin I and T measurements were unaffected by BILN 2061, but cardiac myocytic vacuolation, correlated with mitochondrial swelling, was observed after three or more doses. Echocardiographic traces obtained after twenty-eight consecutive days of dosing revealed two animals with diminished left ventricular cardiac ejection fraction. One animal was immediately necropsied and exhibited marked cardiotoxicity. The other was afforded a ten-week treatment-free period during which the left ventricular ejection fraction returned to normal. All recovery animal hearts were microscopically and ultrastructurally normal. High-dose BILN 2061 cardiotoxicity in Rhesus monkeys appeared early in the treatment regimen and exhibited reversibility. A reliable biomarker has yet to be identified.
To investigate the acute effects of intravenous sildenafil on haemodynamics and oxygenation, and its interaction with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in infants at risk of pulmonary hypertension early after cardiac surgery.
Prospective, randomised trial.
Paediatric intensive care unit of a children's hospital.
Sixteen ventilated infants early after closure of ventricular or atrioventricular septal defects, were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The study was completed in 15 infants.
Studies were commenced within 7 h of separation from bypass. Seven infants received iNO (20 ppm) first, with the addition of intravenous sildenafil (0.35 mg/kg over 20 min) after 20 min. Eight infants received sildenafil first, iNO was added after 20 min. Vascular pressures, cardiac output and a blood gas were recorded at 0, 20 and 40 min.
In infants receiving iNO first, iNO lowered the pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) from 3.45 to 2.95 units (p=0.01); sildenafil further reduced PVRI to 2.45 units p<0.05). In those receiving sildenafil first, PVRI was reduced from 2.84 to 2.35 units (p<0.05) with sildenafil, and fell to 2.15 units (p=0.01) with the addition of iNO. In both groups, sildenafil reduced the systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (p<0.01) and worsened arterial oxygenation and the alveolar-arterial gradient (p<0.05).
Intravenous sildenafil augmented the pulmonary vasodilator effects of iNO in infants early after cardiac surgery. However, sildenafil produced systemic hypotension and impaired oxygenation, which was not improved by iNO.
We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study to compare the efficacy of warfarin with aspirin for the prevention of major vascular events (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or sudden death) in patients with symptomatic stenosis of a major intracranial artery. Patients with 50 to 99% stenosis of an intracranial artery (carotid; anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral; vertebral; or basilar) were identified by reviewing the results of consecutive angiograms performed at participating centers between 1985 and 1991. Only patients with TIA or stroke in the territory of the stenotic artery qualified for inclusion in the study. Patients were prescribed warfarin or aspirin according to local physician preference and were followed by chart review and personal or telephone interview. Seven centers enrolled 151 patients; 88 were treated with warfarin and 63 were treated with aspirin. Median follow-up was 14.7 months (warfarin group) and 19.3 months (aspirin group). Vascular risk factors and mean percent stenosis of the symptomatic artery were similar in the two groups, yet the rates of major vascular events were 18.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up in the aspirin group (stroke rate, 10.4/100 patient-years; myocardial infarction or sudden death rate, 7.7/100 patient-years) compared with 8.4 per 100 patient-years of follow-up in the warfarin group (stroke rate, 3.6/100 patient-years; myocardial infarction or sudden death rate, 4.8/100 patient-years). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly higher percentage of patients free of major vascular events among patients treated with warfarin (p = 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
In eight women with polymyositis (three patients), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (three patients), rheumatoid arthritis (one patient) and shoulder-hand syndrome (one patient), weakness developed during high dose prednisone therapy. These women were studied using serial functional and manual muscle tests, determination of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transminase (SGOT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and serum aldolase levels, and urinary excretion of creatine. Insidious onset of weakness was characteristic. Myalgias were seen in five patients and unusual sudden weakness in two. Weakness was always most severe in the pelvic girdle muscles; there was a lesser involvement of shoulder girdle and distal muscles. Serum muscle enzyme levels were normal in all cases, but urinary creatine excretion was invariably increased and proved to be the most sensitive laboratory indicator for clinical diagnosis and for monitoring patient improvement. Serial urinary creatine excretion and serum enzyme studies were of value in differenting steroid myopathy from a flare of myositis in patients with connective tissue disease. Diagnosis and effective management were achieved by the use of readily available laboratory and clinical procedures without resorting to muscle biopsy.
Glucosamine has been used safely to relieve osteoarthritis in humans, but the precise mechanism underlying its efficacy is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the direct effects of glucosamine and related compounds on mast cell mediated inflammation using cultured mast cells and an animal model.
Dinitrophenyl (DNP)-IgE-sensitized rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells were treated with glucosamine-HCl (GlcN-HCl), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), chitin oligomer or chitosan oligomer. Cells were stimulated by DNP-BSA to induce degranulation and released beta-hexosaminedase was determined colorimetrically to measure the degree of degranulation. Dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) sensitized BALB/c mice were administrated orally with 1 or 0.1mg GlcN-HCl or GlcNAc for 6 days. One hour after the final administration, mice were challenged by DNFB to induce ear swelling.
GlcN-HCl significantly inhibited the antigen-induced degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells at higher than 0.01 mg/mL for 24h-treatment while GlcNAc, a chitin oligomer and a chitosan oligomer had no effect. GlcN-HCl also suppressed intracellular calcium mobilization. GlcN-HCl and GlcNAc significantly suppressed the antigen-induced up-regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA. Ear swelling and histamine levels of plasma and ear in DNFB-treated mice were significantly suppressed by oral administration of GlcN-HCl or GlcNAc (0.1 and 1mg) for 6 days.
Our results strongly suggest that GlcN-HCl and GlcNAc have anti-inflammatory effects in vivo by suppressing the activation of mast cells.
Two patients were observed who had transient quadriceps paresis following local inguinal block for postoperative pain control following inguinal herniorrhaphy.
Accidental intra-arterial injection of drugs is a sporadic complication in i.v. drug addicts. A 22-year-old drug-abuser injected flunitrazepam tablets dissolved in tap water into her left femoral artery and presented with clinical signs of acute ischaemia of the left leg. Severe rhabdomyolysis developed within 5 hours after the injection. Selective arterial catheter angiography showed an acute occlusion of the posterior tibial artery. Combination therapy with i.a. urokinase, i.a. prostaglandines and i.v. anticoagulation resulted in re-opening of the obstructed distal artery and complete cessation of symptoms.
The hypotensive effect of guanfacin was evaluated in 39 essentially hypertensive patients aged 18 to 64 years and treated for 2 months. Their central, and peripheral hemodynamics, intracardiac kinetics and some humoral factors responsible for vascular tonicity control were also examined. The drug can be effective in patients with second- and third-stage essential hypertension, with a good hypotensive effect being obvious within 3-5 days of treatment (3 mg daily was the highest dose). In the course of treatment, general left-ventricular pump function returned to normal in 20 patients exhibiting a good hypotensive effect. Within 2 months of treatment, originally high plasma renin activity returned to normal, and the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme declined.
Six cases that required soft-tissue replacement in the central midface are presented. The greatest number of flaps were used for large defects in patients with cleft palates who had undergone multiple previous operations. Several were for palatal defects attributable to cocaine abuse, and one was used for lining in a nasal reconstruction. There were no flap losses and, on the basis of these experiences, it is concluded that this is an excellent method for providing soft tissue in these difficult situations.
To evaluate the effect of a hypothyroid state, induced by chronic propylthiouracil administration, on splanchnic and systemic hemodynamic parameters in rats with portal hypertension due to portal vein ligation.
Portal hypertension was induced by surgical stenosis of the portal vein. Cardiac index and portal blood flow were measured using radioactive microspheres. Measurements were performed after treatment with propylthiouracil (1 mg/ml in drinking water) for 5 days.
Propylthiouracil-treated portal hypertensive rats had a lower portal pressure (12.4 +/- 1.9 versus 16.3 +/- 0.7 mmHg; p < 0.05) and portal blood flow (11.6 +/- 0.7 versus 13.2 +/- 1.3 ml/min/100 g; p < 0.05) than non-treated animals. Splanchnic vasoconstriction in treated animals was associated with a higher peripheral vascular resistance (2.3 +/- 0.4 versus 1.8 +/- 0.3 mmHg/ml/min/100 g; p < 0.05) than controls.
These results suggest that portal pressure can be lowered by inducing a hypothyroid state by chronic administration of propylthiouracil.
The role of catalase in methanol (MeOH) teratogenesis is unclear. In rodents it both detoxifies reactive oxygen species (ROS) and metabolizes MeOH and its formic acid (FA) metabolite. We treated pregnant mice expressing either high (hCat) or low catalase activity (aCat), or their wild-type (WT) controls, with either MeOH (4g/kg ip) or saline. hCat mice and WTs were similarly susceptible to MeOH-initiated ophthalmic abnormalities and cleft palates. aCat and WT mice appeared resistant, precluding assessment of the developmental impact of catalase deficiency. Catalase activity was respectively increased at least 1.5-fold, and decreased by at least 35%, in hCat and aCat embryos and maternal livers. MeOH and FA pharmacokinetic profiles were similar among hCat, aCat and WT strains. Although the hCat results imply no ROS involvement, embryo culture studies suggest this may be confounded by maternal factors and/or a requirement for higher catalase activity in the hCat mice.
The dopamine transporter, the molecule responsible for presynaptic reuptake of dopamine and a major site of action of psychostimulant drugs, including cocaine, is encoded by locus SLC6A3 (alias DAT1). The protein's actions and DAT's specific localization to dopaminergic neurons make it a candidate gene for several psychiatric illnesses. Alleles at this locus have been reported to be associated with cocaine-induced paranoia and attention deficit disorder. SLC6A3 has been mapped to distal chromosome 5p, using physical methods. Our goal was to place SLC6A3 in the genetic linkage map and to test for linkage to Tourette syndrome. Genetic linkage methods were used to place SLC6A3 in the genetic linkage map. Four extended pedigrees (one of which overlaps with CEPH) were typed. Linkage with Tourette syndrome (TS) was also examined. SLC6A3 showed close linkage with several markers previously mapped to distal chromosome 5p, including D5S11 (Zmax = 16.0, theta M = theta F = 0.03, results from four families) and D5S678 (Zmax = 7.84, theta M = theta F = 0, results from two families). Observed crossovers established that SLC6A3 is a distal marker close to D5S10 and D5S678, but these three distal markers could not be ordered. Linkage between TS and SLC6A3 could be excluded independently in two branches of a large kindred segregating TS; the lod score in a third family was also negative, but not significant. Cumulative results show a lod score of -6.2 at theta = 0 and of -3.9 at theta = 0.05 (dominant model, narrow disease definition). SLC6A3 thus maps to distal chromosome 5p by linkage analysis, in agreement with previous physical mapping data. A mutation at SLC6A3 is not causative for TS in the two large families that generated significant negative lod scores (if the parameters of our analyses were correct) and is unlikely to be causative in the family that generated a negative lod score that did not reach significance. These results do not exclude a role for the dopamine transporter in influencing risk for TS in combination with other loci.
Experimentally naive male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 85-110 g) were used to examine the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Repeated administration of cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) for 7 consecutive days produced locomotor sensitization. Pretreatment with iNOS inhibitors, L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl) lysine (NIL) or (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; 10 mg/kg, ip), 30 min before cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) administration totally blocked the development of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Dopamine (DA) receptor binding in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) showed a significant decrease in the density of D(2) receptor and the affinity of D(1) receptor after cocaine treatment. Pretreatment with EGCG or NIL abolished the cocaine-induced changes in these parameters. These results suggest that iNOS may participate in the process of development of locomotor sensitization through the modulation of DA receptors in the NAC.
The role of rapamycin in pancreas stem cells remains to be clearly elucidated. Herein, we evaluated the effects of rapamycin on porcine neonatal pancreas cell clusters (NPCCs), which primarily comprised pancreatic precursors, and attempted to find an intracellular mechanism about the harmful effects of rapamycin.
Porcine NPCCs were treated with rapamycin in a monolayer, and the apoptosis and proliferation were determined via caspase-3 assay and H-thymidine uptake analysis. The expression of transcription factors was assessed via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. For the in vivo study, the porcine NPCCs were transplanted into the kidney subcapsules of normal nude mice and treated with rapamycin.
Rapamycin treatment significantly reduced the number of β cells, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and the insulin contents in the monolayer-cultured porcine NPCCs. Furthermore, rapamycin treatment increased the apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of β cells in the culture dishes. The expressions of the insulin, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1, and NeuroD/Beta2 genes were down-regulated via rapamycin treatment. The expression of insulin-like growth factor-II was significantly down-regulated, but the expression of Foxo1 was simultaneously inversely increased, and the translocation of Foxo1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was induced by rapamycin treatment. Moreover, rapamycin treatment induced a marked reduction in the relative volume and absolute mass of β cells in the porcine NPCCs grafts at 8 weeks after transplantation in the normal nude mice.
Here, we demonstrate that rapamycin treatment suppresses the expansion and differentiation of porcine NPCCs, and the alteration of Foxo1 and insulin-like growth factor-II gene expression might be the crucial factors.
We evaluated the effects of opiate consumption on semen quality, sperm function, seminal plasma antioxidant capacity, and sperm DNA integrity. A total of 142 opiate addict men (group 1) were enrolled in the study and 146 healthy age matched male volunteers (group 2) served as controls. Two semen analyses were performed in all participants. Sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) was used to identify sperm DNA integrity. The mean±SD sperm concentration in opiate users and in control subjects was 22.2±4.4 and 66.3±8.3 million per ml, respectively (P=0.002). A significant increase in the amount of fragmented DNA was found in opiate consumers compared with that in controls (36.4±3.8% vs. 27.1±2.4%, P=0.004). Significantly decreased levels of catalase-like and superoxide dismutase-like (SOD) activity were observed in group 1 compared with group 2. Opiate consumption has significant adverse effects on semen quality. In cases of unexplained infertility in men, opium consumption should be considered as a possible factor.
Modafinil was tested for efficacy in facilitating abstinence in cocaine-dependent patients, compared to placebo.
This was a double-blind placebo-controlled study, with 12 weeks of treatment and a 4-week follow-up. Six outpatient substance abuse treatment clinics participated in the study. There were 210 treatment-seekers randomized, having a diagnosis of cocaine dependence; 72 participants were randomized to placebo, 69 to modafinil 200mg, and 69 to modafinil 400mg, taken once daily on awakening. Participants came to the clinic three times per week for assessments and urine drug screens, and had one hour of individual psychotherapy weekly. The primary outcome measure was the weekly percentage of cocaine non-use days.
The GEE regression analysis showed that for the total sample, there was no significant difference between either modafinil group and placebo in the change in average weekly percent of cocaine non-use days over the 12-week treatment period (p>0.79). However, two secondary outcomes showed significant effects by modafinil 200mg: the maximum number of consecutive non-use days for cocaine (p=0.02), and a reduction in craving (p=0.04). Also, a post hoc analysis showed a significant effect of modafinil that increased the weekly percentage of non-use days in the subgroup of those cocaine patients who did not have a history of alcohol dependence (p<0.02).
These data suggest that modafinil, in combination with individual behavioral therapy, was effective for increasing cocaine non-use days in participants without co-morbid alcohol dependence, and in reducing cocaine craving.
An unusual acute hypotensive syndrome has been observed in association with administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) to patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In the 11 cases that have been reported, the syndrome differs from classic anaphylaxis and resembles septic shock. Mediation by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been hypothesized, but the mechanism has not been characterized with cytokine assays, and no invasive hemodynamic measurements have been reported. We describe a case of recurrent hyperdynamic shock--without classic features of anaphylaxis, without detectable IgE antibodies against TMP or SMZ, and without detectable levels of TNF--involving an HIV-infected patient rechallenged with TMP-SMZ.
Phospholipidosis (PLD) is characterized by an intracellular accumulation of phospholipids in lysosomes and the concurrent development of concentric lamellar bodies. Recently, H. Sawada et al. (2005, Toxicol. Sci. 83, 282-292) identified 17 genes as potential biomarkers of PLD in HepG2 cells. The present study was undertaken to determine if this set of genes measured by quantitative PCR could be validated in the same cell line. The objective was also to investigate the dose-response relationship to further validate the assay and to select the concentrations to use for screening activities. In a first experiment (one concentration tested), out of the 17 genes, the best gene biomarkers of PLD (i.e., 11 genes) were selected for practical screening reasons. Based on these genes, 91.6% (i.e., 11 of 12) of the compounds known to induce PLD were identified as positive and all the negative compounds (i.e., five of five) were also confirmed. When the data obtained in the first experiment were compared to the data by Sawada et al., (2005) the coefficient of correlation calculated was slightly higher than 75%. In the second experiment (26 compounds [all 17 compounds from the first experiment plus 9 other compounds] tested at a minimum of three concentrations), 93.3% (14/15) of the compounds known to induce PLD were identified as such and all the negative controls (six compounds) were also confirmed. Three compounds likely to induce PLD were identified as positive in our assay. Finally, two compounds for which no data are available were also tested. When both experiments 1 and 2 were compared, the coefficient of correlation for 16 compounds tested at the same concentrations reached 87.7%. In conclusion, the present study further confirms the utility of gene expression in HepG2 cells to identify a potential to induce PLD. Finally, based on the data presented, researchers are encouraged to use a range of minimum three concentrations (e.g., 12.5, 25, and 50 microM) to screen for PLD in the human HepG2 cell line.
