Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic widely used in children with respiratory infections. Mania is an extremely rare psychiatric side effect. A pediatric case of typical manic symptoms associated with clarithromycin-use and resembling those in adults is presented. It was notable that the patient had no genetic predisposition.
Adverse effects associated with peginterferon and ribavirin during hepatitis C treatment are well known. Sudden hearing loss has rarely been reported. Possible mechanisms involved include direct ototoxicity of interferon, autoimmunity, and hematological changes. Hearing loss is frequently fully resolved after discontinuation of antiviral therapy. We report a 47-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 2 ac who developed sudden hearing loss 22 wk after starting therapy with peginterferon alpha 2a at a dose of 180 microg/wk and ribavirin 800 mg per day. Since symptoms did not worsen, antiviral therapy was continued for 2 wk, according to the patient's wish. Hearing loss resolved within 2 wk after the end of treatment. Serum liver alanine aminotransferase remained normal during and after the end of antiviral therapy. HCV RNA was undetectable at the end of therapy and remained negative 24 wk later. Thus, patients should be aware that hearing loss may occur with peginterferon therapy, but the decision whether to continue or to stop the treatment is based on the clinical judgment of the physician and the wishes of the patient.
Huntington's disease is a progressive, degenerative disease characterized by abnormal body movements called chorea, and a reduction of various mental abilities. 3-Nitropropionic acid, an inhibitor of complex II of the electron transport chain, causes Huntington's disease-like symptoms in rodents. Recently, it has been reported that oxidative stress, which is one of the pathological hallmarks of various neurodegenerative disorders, also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. The present study was designed to investigate effects of resveratrol, an antioxidant with cyclooxygenase I inhibitory activity, in the 3-nitropropionic acid-induced model of Huntington's disease. Intraperitoneal administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (20 mg/kg for 4 days) caused significant loss of body weight, a decline in motor function (locomotor activity, movement pattern and vacuous chewing movements) and poor retention of memory. Repeated treatment with resveratrol (5 and 10 mg/kg, orally), once daily for a period of 8 days beginning 4 days prior to 3-nitropropionic acid administration, significantly improved the 3-nitropropionic acid-induced motor and cognitive impairment. Biochemical analysis revealed that systemic 3-nitropropionic acid administration significantly increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite levels, and depleted reduced glutathione levels, and decreased succinate dehydrogenase activity in the brains of rats. The results of the present study indicate that resveratrol (5 and 10 mg/kg, orally) significantly reversed 3-nitropropionic acid-induced motor and cognitive impairment, and that the beneficial effects of resveratrol might be attributed to its antioxidant activity.
Synoptic weather and ambient air quality synergistically influence human health. We report the relative risk of mortality from all non-accidental, respiratory-, and cardiovascular-related causes, associated with exposure to four air pollutants, by weather type and season, in 10 major Canadian cities for 1981 through 1999. We conducted this multi-city time-series study using Poisson generalized linear models stratified by season and each of six distinctive synoptic weather types. Statistically significant relationships of mortality due to short-term exposure to carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone were found, with significant modifications of risk by weather type, season, and mortality cause. In total, 61% of the respiratory-related mortality relative risk estimates were significantly higher than for cardiovascular-related mortality. The combined effect of weather and air pollution is greatest when tropical-type weather is present in the spring or summer.
To determine whether sulfasalazine can prevent apoptosis in spermatogenic cells by preventing the activation of NF-kappaB in spermatogenic epithelium in experimental testicular torsion.
Thirty-two adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to unilateral 720 degree testicular torsion for durations of 0 h and 2 h, then the torsion was relieved. The ischemic/reperfused testes were collected for the detection of NF-kappaB expression with Western blotting and immunohistochemistry techniques, and detection of apoptosis with TUNEL techniques.
The NF-kappaB coefficient of spermatogenic epithelium and the apoptosis index of spermatogenic cells were significantly different in the operation and the sham-operation groups after experimental testicular torsion (P<0.01).
NF-kappaB activation of spermatogenic epithelium is related to apoptosis of spermatogenic cells. Sulfasalazine can prevent apoptosis in spermatogenic cells after the experimental testicular torsion through prevention of NF-kappaB activation.
To synthesize and study the anti-diabetic activity of (RS)-2-ethoxy-3-{4-[2-(4-trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy-phenyl)-ethoxy]-phenyl}-propionic acid (compound I).
Compound I was prepared in 6 steps, using 4-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-phenol as the starting material. The in vitro selectivity and potency of target compound I, rosiglitazone and WY-14643 on human PPARalpha and PPARgamma were determined in reporter gene assays. In vivo, rosiglitazone and compound I were administered orally to KK(Ay) mice for 14 d. Insulin tolerance tests and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed on the 10th and 14th day of treatment, respectively. At the end of the treatment, sera were collected for biochemical analysis.
In vitro, compound I significantly activated both PPARalpha and PPARgamma. In vivo, compound I corrected the impaired insulin and glucose tolerance of KK(Ay) mice, and produced a significant reduction in plasma triglyceride levels after 14 d of treatment. The effect produced was significant compared with the control group.
Both in vitro and in vivo anti-diabetic activity studies for compound I were conducted and the data suggest that this compound is a potentially effective anti-diabetic agent.
In three patients with SIADH, mannitol or glycerol promoted a rapid free water diuresis. Use of osmotic agents requires less laboratory and clinical monitoring than use of furosemide, is appropriate treatment, and in fact may be the treatment of choice in some patients with symptomatic hyponatremia from SIADH.
Cutaneous reactions to vitamin K1 (phytomenadione) are uncommon. They can present as acute eczematous reactions or late reactions that resemble localized scleroderma after vitamin K1 injections. A case is reported here of a patient who developed bilateral sclerodermoid plaques in a cowboy's holster pattern, which persisted for more than 10 years after subcutaneous vitamin K1 injections. Positive intradermal test with vitamin K1 that persisted as an erythematous indurated plaque at the test site for more than 5 months confirmed marked cutaneous hypersensitivity to vitamin K1 in this patient. Serial biopsies of the erythematous plaque at the test site showed transition from spongiotic eczematous features initially to inflammatory morphoea-like histology over a 5 month period. Possible pathogenic mechanisms for phytomenadione-induced pseudoscleroderma are discussed.
To examine the prediction of coffee consumption on the incidence of Parkinson's disease.
The study population comprised 6710 men and women, aged 50-79 years and free from Parkinson's disease at the baseline. At baseline, enquiries were made about coffee consumption in a self-administered questionnaire as the average number of cups per day. During a 22-year follow-up, 101 incident cases of Parkinson's disease occurred. Parkinson's disease cases were identified through a nationwide registry of patients receiving medication reimbursement, which is based on certificates from neurologist.
After adjustments for age, sex, marital status, education, community density, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity, smoking, body mass index, hypertension and serum cholesterol, the relative risk for subjects drinking 10 or more cups of coffee per day compared with non-drinkers was 0.26 (95% confidence interval 0.07-0.99, P-value for trend=0.18). The association was stronger among overweight persons and among persons with lower serum cholesterol level (P-value for interaction=0.04 and 0.03, respectively).
The results support the hypothesis that coffee consumption reduces the risk of Parkinson's disease, but protective effect of coffee may vary by exposure to other factors.
There is evidence that iron may play a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There may be genetic factors that contribute to iron deposition resulting in tissue damage thus exacerbating AD.
We have genotyped 269 healthy elderly controls, 191 cases with definite or probable AD, and 69 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the OPTIMA cohort.
We have examined the interaction between the C2 variant of the transferrin (TF) gene and the C282Y allele of the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene as risk factors for developing AD. Our results showed that each of the two variants was associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others. The interaction was significant by logistic regression (p = 0.014) and by synergy factor analysis (p = 0.015, synergy factor = 5.1). Further, carriers of these two alleles plus apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) were at still higher risk of AD: of the 14 tri-carriers of the three variants, identified in this study, 12 had AD and two MCI.
We suggest that the combination of TF C2 and HFE C282Y may lead to an excess of redox-active iron and the induction of oxidative stress in neurones, which is exacerbated in carriers of APOE4. Since 4% of Northern Europeans carry the two iron-related variants and since iron overload is a treatable condition, these results merit replication.
This study aimed at elucidating the role of anticoagulation in the genesis of late pericardial effusion and tamponade after cardiac surgery. Using serial 2-D echocardiography, 141 patients undergoing surgery for coronary artery bypass (56), valvular (69) or congenital (16) [corrected] heart disease were studied postoperatively. Group 1 (74 patients) received full anticoagulation (warfarin 73; heparin 1) and group 2 (67 patients) received either antithrombotic agents (aspirin plus dipyridamole), or no treatment. Fifty percent (70/141) of patients developed effusion. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of either effusion in general (43/74; 58% vs 27/67; 40%, respectively) or small or medium sized effusion. However, a large effusion was significantly more common in group 1 than in group 2 (32% vs 4%, P < 0.005). Twelve patients (12/141; 8.5%) developed late tamponade, 7 to 33 (15 +/- 7.3 mean +/- SD) days after surgery. All had a large effusion demonstrated by echo, drained by pericardiocentesis, and none died. All 12 patients with tamponade belonged to group 1 (P < 0.001). Excess anticoagulation was detected at least once in 41 of the 74 group 1 patients (55%). When compared to properly anticoagulated patients, excessively anticoagulated patients had a similar overall incidence of effusion and a similar incidence of small or moderate effusion, but a higher incidence of large effusion (18% vs 44%, [corrected] P < 0.05) and tamponade (3% vs 27%, P < 0.025). We conclude that, unlike small or medium-sized effusions, large pericardial effusions and tamponade are more likely to occur among anticoagulated patients, especially if they are excessively anticoagulated.
A 42-year-old male presented with acute onset of an inferior visual field defect OD after sildenafil citrate use. Examination revealed a right relative afferent pupillary defect and a swollen disc with a 0.1 cup-to-disc ratio and a prominent disc hemorrhage. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is associated with acute episodes of hypotension in patients with structurally crowded discs. Sildenafil citrate may cause episodes of hypotension and was temporally related to the onset of symptoms in this patient. Because patients are often reluctant to volunteer their history of sildenafil citrate use, the physician may need to ask specifically about use of this medication. Physicians should counsel patients with crowded optic discs and a history of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in one eye that use of sildenafil citrate might increase their risk of ischemic optic neuropathy in the fellow eye.
The alpha7 (alpha7) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor may represent a drug target for the treatment of disorders associated with working memory/attentional dysfunction. We investigated the effects of three distinct alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists: 2-methyl-5-(6-phenyl-pyridazin-3-yl)-octahydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (A-582941; 0.01-0.1 mg/kg), 4-bromophenyl 1,4-diazabicyclo(3.2.2) nonane-4-carboxylate (SSR180711; 0.3-3 mg/kg) and N-[(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-4-chlorobenzamide (PNU-282987; 1-10 mg/kg), on scopolamine-induced deficits in a modified Y-maze procedure. Mice were forced to choose one of two visually distinct arms, and were confined there for a 5 min exploration period before being allowed to explore both arms for a 2 min test session, immediately thereafter. The time spent in each arm, entries and total distance travelled were recorded using an automated system. Characterisation experiments showed that scopolamine-treated (1 mg/kg) mice spent less time exploring the unfamiliar arm, when compared with vehicle-treated animals. Combination experiments showed that all three alpha7 agonists ameliorated scopolamine-induced changes in unfamiliar arm exploration. In conclusion, the present data support the idea that alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may represent an interesting target for the treatment of conditions associated with attentional/working memory dysfunction.
This study was conducted to explore whether intra-arterial infusion of phenytoin causes cerebral ischemia and to examine the mechanism of cerebral ischemia induced by phenytoin.
Ten rats were infused with phenytoin (150 microL, 3.75 mg) retrogradely from the left external carotid artery, followed by perfusion of carbon black transcardially. The removed brain was photographed from above, and the nonperfused area was compared with control rats (n = 10) with the use of an image analyzer. Eight animals with or without phenytoin treatment were perfusion-fixed for transmission electron microscopic analyses of cerebral vasculature. To determine the effect of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) on phenytoin-infused rat cerebrum, 20 rats were treated with or without TPA (120,000 IU) 5 minutes after the phenytoin infusion (n = 10 each).
All rats suffered from respiratory distress 25 to 40 minutes after the injection and received carbon black transcardially. The nonperfused area was seen in the territory of the left internal carotid artery. Thrombi were observed from arterioles to capillaries. Under electron microscopy, endothelial cells were partially exfoliated, and the vascular lumen was obstructed by thrombi predominantly consisting of platelets. Eight rats with TPA survived more than 60 minutes, whereas only 2 rats survived without the treatment (P < .005). Nonperfused areas were 7 +/- 5% and 50 +/- 11% of cerebral surface area in rats with and without TPA treatment, respectively (P < .001).
Intra-arterial infusion of phenytoin results in a nonperfused area in rat cerebrum primarily due to thrombosis of arterioles and capillaries.
Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have elevations of fasting plasma insulin that are hypothesized to be associated with disrupted brain insulin metabolism. We examined paired fasted plasma and CSF insulin levels in 25 patients with AD and 14 healthy age-matched adults and determined whether insulin levels were related to severity of dementia and apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 homozygosity, a known genetic risk factor for AD. The AD patients had lower CSF insulin, higher plasma insulin, and a reduced CSF-to-plasma insulin ratio when compared with healthy adults. The differences were greater for patients with more advanced AD. Patients who were not apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 homozygotes had higher plasma insulin levels and reduced CSF-to-plasma ratios, whereas epsilon4 homozygotes with AD had normal values. Both plasma and CSF insulin levels are abnormal in AD, and there are metabolic differences among apolipoprotein E genotypes.
We conducted a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy of prophylactic metaraminol for preventing propofol-induced hypotension. Thirty patients aged 55-75 years undergoing general anaesthesia were randomly allocated to receive either metaraminol 0.5 mg or saline before administration of fentanyl 1 microg.kg(-1) and propofol 2 mg.kg(-1). Induction of anaesthesia was associated with a decrease in mean and systolic arterial pressure in both groups (p = 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups. These results show that prophylactic use of metaraminol 0.5 mg does not prevent the decrease in blood pressure following fentanyl and propofol induction in older patients.
We have presented a case of thiazide-induced hyponatremia that followed an unusual course after the patient, suffering from extreme lethargy, was admitted with a serum sodium concentration of 104 mEq/L. Although the electrolyte imbalance was essentially corrected within 20 hours and there was clinical improvement, three days later the patient suddenly lost consciousness. She was comatose for more than a month, apparently from extrapontine myelinolysis. After a dramatic improvement, the patient was discharged with almost no neurologic deficit.
Psychosis and/or seizures following the administration of intramuscular penicillin G procaine have not been reported in the pediatric literature to our knowledge. This omission is regrettable in light of the frequency with which this treatment is indicated as therapy for gonococcal infections. We report clinical data from four patients afflicted by this reaction known as Hoigne's syndrome. The dramatic and unexpected manifestation of this condition calls for an immediate diagnosis to proceed with the appropriate treatment.
Recent reports of the dramatic antitumor effect of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) have renewed interest in the oncologic indications for retinoids. Furthermore, a variety of pediatric tumors are responsive to RA in vitro, which provides additional rationale for a phase I evaluation of RA in children with cancer that is refractory to standard therapy.
A phase I trial of RA administered orally twice daily for 28-day treatment courses was performed. Cohorts of at least three pediatric cancer patients were entered at successive RA dose levels (from 45 to 80 mg/m2/d) until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was consistently observed.
The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of RA was 60 mg/m2/d. Three of eight patients at the 80-mg/m2/d dose level developed reversible pseudotumor cerebri that necessitated discontinuation of the agent. Both patients with APL achieved complete remission (CR), whereas no patients with solid tumors had objective responses. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated a relatively short terminal half-life for RA (45 minutes), with diminution in plasma levels after chronic dosing.
The MTD and recommended phase II dose for RA in children is 60 mg/m2/d given twice daily. Reversible CNS toxicity related to RA-induced pseudotumor cerebri is dose-limiting. Two children with APL achieved a CR to RA, which supports the inclusion of pediatric patients in clinical trials that evaluate the use of RA for patients with APL.
The use of preradiotherapy (RT) methotrexate (MTX) has improved disease control and survival in patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). The reported protocol was designed to optimize and enhance the chemotherapeutic component of treatment.
Fifty-two patients were treated with five cycles of high-dose MTX 3.5 g/m(2), procarbazine 100 mg/m(2)/d, and vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2). Thirty patients received whole-brain RT (45 Gy). Twenty-two older patients deferred RT to diminish the risk of delayed neurotoxicity; these patients are compared with 12 older patients who completed the entire treatment regimen. Most patients (n = 35) received high-dose cytarabine after RT.
Objective response rate to the induction chemotherapy regimen was 90%; overall median survival is 60 months. Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was seen in 30 patients, primarily in association with cytarabine; grade 3 nephrotoxicity due to MTX was seen in two patients. Older patients had similar median survival with or without the addition of RT: 32 versus 33 months, respectively. However, late neurotoxicity was significantly more common in those older patients who received RT (P: =.00004). Patients younger than 60 years who received the complete treatment regimen have not reached median disease-free or overall survival.
Increasing the dose of MTX and adding procarbazine and vincristine improved disease control and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL. Younger patients in particular fared extremely well with this treatment regimen. In older patients, deferring whole-brain RT did not compromise overall survival but did reduce treatment-related toxicity.
Two cases of fulminant hyperpyrexia induced by cytotoxic agents (bleomycin in a patient with lymphoma, and daunorubicin in a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia) are presented. Each patient had a fever greater than 42 degrees C, with a shock-like reaction and coma. Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy developed in the patient with bleomycin-induced hyperpyrexia and she died 24 hours afterwards. The pathogenesis and management of hyperpyrexial reactions to cytotoxic drugs are discussed.
The role of progestogen in vascular complications is currently being investigated. The Committee on Safety of Medicines in the United Kingdom has examined 2000 reports of vascular complications related to the hormonal content of oral contraceptives, in particular, norethisterone acetate and levonorgestrel. The 1st progestogen was combined with 50 mcg estrogen and the 2nd with 30 mcg. A significant statistical association was observed between higher doses of norethisterone acetate and death from ischemic heart disease and stroke. There was also a correlation with nonfatal events from the 2 conditions, but not with risk of hypertension or venous thrombosis. Levonorgestrel had an excess of stroke but no association with hypertension and venous thrombosis. In considering the estrogen content of the oral contraceptives, the 30 mcg estrogen had fewer deaths and less ischemic heart disease than was observed with 50 mcg estrogen. These data suggest that lowering the progestogen content of oral contraceptives should reduce the risk of arterial thromboembolism. It also reinforces the value of lower estrogen content. The risks of thromboembolism appear to be age-related, and if the risks are not acceptable to the woman who has completed her family or is over the age of 30, other well-tried alternatives should be considered. The ideal oral contraceptive is yet to be developed.
Introduction of Gadolinium (Gd) to the nervous system is linked to the development of neurotoxicity involving both oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Gd levels (0.2-20 μm) in the form of gadolinium trichloride (GdCl(3)) cause neurotoxicity in vitro. We investigated the signaling pathways in primary cultured rat cortical neurons and tested whether GdCl(3) induced oxidative and ER stress. Results showed that Gd-induced neural cell death followed a rapid accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. In addition, Gd exposure resulted in spliced X-box binding protein 1 mRNA and increased expression of binding immunoglobulin protein, thus activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), ATF6, and C/EBP homologous protein mRNA. Up-regulated expression of binding immunoglobulin protein is a hallmark of ER stress and C/EBP homologous protein is an ER stress-related pro-apoptotic transcription factor. Activation of ER stress downstream substrates, inositol-requiring kinase 1 and ATF6, was also observed in Gd-treated cells. The neurotoxic effects of Gd were blocked by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Results demonstrated that Gd-induced cytotoxicity in neurons occurs via oxidative injury and ER stress-related signal transduction, thus offering new insight into the neurotoxicology of gadolinium.
The perilipins are highly phosphorylated adipocyte proteins that are localized at the surface of the lipid droplet. With activation by protein kinase A, perilipins translocate away from the lipid droplet and allow hormone-sensitive lipase to hydrolyze the adipocyte triglycerides to release nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA). Because of the potential importance of adipocyte lipolysis to obesity and insulin resistance, we measured perilipin protein and mRNA levels in nondiabetic subjects with varying degrees of insulin resistance. By Northern and Western blotting, we could detect perilipin A, but not perilipin B. Perilipin A protein and mRNA levels were quantitated and were highly correlated with each other. There was a significant positive relationship between perilipin expression and obesity (r = 0.55; P < 0.01, perilipin mRNA vs. percent body fat). However, there was no significant relationship between perilipin expression and blood NEFA, nor was there a significant relationship between perilipin expression and insulin resistance, using the insulin sensitivity index derived from the iv glucose tolerance test with minimal modeling. In addition, there was no significant relationship between perilipin and adipocyte or systemic inflammatory markers, such as TNFalpha, IL-6, and adiponectin. Thus, perilipin was elevated in obese subjects, perhaps as a compensatory mechanism to limit basal lipolysis. However, there was no relationship between perilipin and insulin resistance.
