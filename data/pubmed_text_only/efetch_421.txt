The present study was to evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, versus placebo in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in a homogenous group of female patients undergoing breast reduction surgery under general anaesthesia. Approximately one hour before skin closure, 70 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 35 each. In a double blind manner each group of patients received either intravenous ondansetron (4mg) or a matching placebo. The overall incidences of PONV during first 24-hour were 60% and 20% in placebo and ondansetron group respectively (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference after 24-hour postoperatively. In placebo group 42.9% of patients received rescue anti-emetic (metoclopramide) for the treatment of severe PONV (ie, 2 or more episodes of PONV), whereas, only 8.6% patients were administered such intervention in the ondansetron group (p<0.05). It is, therefore, concluded that prophylactic administration of intravenous ondansetron (4mg) one hour before skin closure is safe and effective in preventing PONV in female patients undergoing breast surgery and routine use of ondansetron in the patient population is recommended.
Pergolide is a dopamine agonist that improves Parkinson disease but is associated with dose-dependent sleepiness. This study evaluates the effect of a nighttime dose of 1 mg of pergolide on actigraphic measures of sleep using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. The pergolide group (n = 10) worsened in actigraphic measures of sleep efficiency and sleep fragmentation vs the placebo group (n = 12). Side effects were more frequent in the pergolide group.
Mivacurium and succinylcholine are short-acting neuromuscular blocking drugs. The duration of their action depends on their rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase. More than thirty genetic variants of this enzyme have been described but the atypical variant is the most frequently involved in prolonged apnoea following the administration of these two myorelaxants. We present one case of patient who presented a five hours long apnoea associated with null cholinesterase activity and detection of a butyrylcholinesterase silent variant (Sil-1, 1 for 100,000 persons in population) after sequencing.
The chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely accepted part of many cancer treatment protocols. Its cardiotoxic potential is known, but considered uncommon and usually not life threatening, although some cases of severe cardiotoxicity related to 5-FU have been reported. The pathogenesis of cardiotoxicity caused by 5-FU is not clear. We report a case of sudden onset of severe cardiac failure, without ischemic symptoms or signs, during 5-FU treatment with serious consequences, in a previously healthy 23-year-old patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Endomyocardial biopsy showed proliferation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum with marked vacuolization, similar to that found with doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Because 5-FU cardiotoxicity is unpredictable and can have potentially fatal consequences, it requires, in our opinion, further clarification. With this well-documented case, including an endomyocardial biopsy, we hope to encourage additional efforts to investigate the pathophysiologic mechanisms of 5-FU cardiotoxicity.
A reproducible model for producing diffuse myocardial injury (epinephrine infusion) has been developed to study the cardioprotective effects of agents or maneuvers which might alter the evolution of acute myocardial infarction. Infusions of epinephrine (4 mug per kilogram per minute for 6 hours) increased radiocalcium uptakes into intact myocardium and each of its subcellular components with the mitochondrial fraction showing the most consistent changes when compared to saline-infused control animals (4,957 vs. 827 counts per minute per gram of dried tissue or fraction). Myocardial concentrations of calcium also increased significantly (12.0 vs. 5.0 mg.per 100 Gm. of fat-free dry weight). Infusions of calcium chloride sufficient to raise serum calcium concentrations 2 mEq. per liter failed to increase calcium influx into the myocardial cell. Mitochondrial radiocalcium uptakes were significantly decreased in animals pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid or dipyridamole or when hydrocortisone was added to the epinephrine infusion (2,682,2,803, and 3,424 counts per minute per gram of dried fraction, respectively). Myocardial calcium concentrations also were decreased (11.2, 8.3, and 8.9 mg. per 100 Gm. of fat-free dry weight, respectively) in the three treatment groups, being significantly decreased only in the last two. Evidence of microscopic damage was graded as less severe in the three treatment groups. Acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and hydrocortisone all appear to have cardioprotective effects when tested in this model.
The INK4a-ARF locus, located on chromosome 9p21, encodes 2 cell cycle-regulatory proteins, p16(INKa) and p14(ARF), acting through the Rb-CDK4 and p53 pathways. This study was done to investigate the contribution of the INK4a-ARF locus in tumorigenesis of angiosarcoma of the liver. Alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INKa), and p53 in primary liver angiosarcoma from 19 patients were analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), restriction enzyme-related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), microsatellite analysis, and DNA sequencing. As a control group, 12 angiosarcomas from other organs were analyzed. Promoter methylation of p14(ARF) was found in 5 of 19 cases (26%), and p16(INKa) showed aberrant promoter methylation in 12 of 19 cases (63%). One tumor (5%) had homozygous deletion of the INK4a-ARF locus. Methylation and deletion correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. Methylated p14(ARF) appeared in the context of a methylated p16(INKa) promoter in 3 cases of the 5 angiosarcomas methylated at p14(ARF). p14(ARF) aberrant methylation was not related to the presence of p53 mutations, which was detected in 6 of 19 (32%) cases. Alterations of the INK4a-ARF locus or p53 as were not established independent prognostic factors in these tumors. In conclusion, our data indicate that the INK4a-ARF locus is frequently inactivated in angiosarcoma of the liver and occurs independently of p53 mutations.
We aimed to investigate whether CYP2D6 polymorphisms were associated with the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect and systemic complications (especially bradycardia) of ophthalmic timolol.
One hundred twenty-three primary open-angle glaucoma subjects (123 eyes) were treated with 0.5% aqueous formulations of ophthalmic timolol. IOP and heart rate were measured before and after timolol administration. DNA was extracted from venous leukocytes of all the subjects. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP2D6, for example, rs16947 (2850C>T, R296C) and rs1135840 (4180C>G, S486T), were detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
Neither rs16947 (P = 0.339) nor rs1135840 (P = 0.903) genotype was statistically correlated with the IOP-lowering effect of timolol eye drops. The rs16947 genotype was significantly associated with occurrence of bradycardia in primary open-angle glaucoma patients (P = 0.021). The patients with rs16947 CT (P = 0.043) or TT (P = 0.043) were more inclined to bradycardia than those with rs16947 CC, although there was no significant difference between CT and TT (P = 0.177). The analysis of variance showed no significant difference in heart rate (P = 0.559) among GG, GC, and CC groups.
CYP2D6 SNP rs16947 may confer susceptibility to timolol-induced bradycardia. Patients with CC genotype were unlikely to suffer from timolol-induced bradycardia, whereas those with TT genotype were found to suffer from timolol-induced bradycardia.
To investigate the extent of cholinergic involvement in opiate-induced catalepsy, the effects of three anticholinergic drugs were studied on morphine-induced catalepsy. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was also examined. Maximum catalepsy in rats was obtained with 30 mg/kg morphine or 3 mg/kg haloperidol. The anticholinergic drugs atropine, benztropine, and scopolamine were unable to antagonize morphine-induced catalepsy, yet readily antagonized haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Low doses of apomorphine (7.5 mg/kg), on the other hand, readily antagonized morphine catalepsy, but 13-fold higher doses of apomorphine were needed to block haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The results are compatible with the idea that catalepsy can be mediated via the striatum or the amygdala; morphine-dopamine antagonism may occur in the amygdala, whereas morphine-dopamine-cholinergic interactions occur in the striatum.
Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and levodopa-induced motor complications experience a short-duration response (SDR) to levodopa which can be considered the basis of motor fluctuations. The SDR is characterized by reduced response duration, increased magnitude of the response and reduced latency to the peak effect. A short latency and a high magnitude are the most salient pharmacological features of the SDR. Its pathophysiology is not totally understood. The pharmacological characteristics of the motor response to apomorphine and their relationship with 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-dopa (FDOPA) and [(11)C]raclopride (RACLO) uptake were studied in 9 patients with PD. Latency to peak effect was positively correlated with putaminal FDOPA uptake (p<0.05) and negatively correlated with RACLO uptake (P<0.05). A trend towards significance (p:0.06) between magnitude of the response and FDOPA uptake was found which were negatively correlated. Levodopa-induced dyskinesias were negatively correlated with FDOPA uptake (p<0.05) and a trend towards significance (positive correlation) with RACLO uptake was observed (p:0.07). These results suggest that both pre and postsynaptic mechanisms are involved in the origin of the SDR.
Angioedema secondary to treatment of one year's duration with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) (lisinopril) in a 56-year-old man scheduled for elective cardiac surgery led unexpectedly to impossible intubation. Surgical access (tracheostomy) was required when airway control was threatened. We review the clinical course, etiology and treatment of angioedema secondary to ACEI therapy. This is a life threatening complication which, though rare, is becoming increasingly frequent with increased use of such drugs.
A 58-year-old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma developed grade 3 proteinuria (8.5 g/24 h) without microscopic hematuria or renal insufficiency five days after temsirolimus infusion. Kidney biopsy revealed ischemic glomeruli and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesion. Proteinuria level decreased to 2.80 g per day two weeks after temsirolimus withdrawal. Clinicians should be aware to this complication.
Institutionalized epileptic patients on long-term anticonvulsant diphenylhydantoin (DPH) therapy were examined clinically. DPH plasma levels were unexpectedly high in 54% despite rather poor seizure control. No patient was free from side effects, which included gingival hypertrophy (90% of patients), increased alkaline phosphatase activity (55%), suggestion of a sensory peripheral neuropathy (34%), central nervous system (CNS) intoxication (22%), coarsened facial features (19%), tendency to bleed excessively (15%), hirsutism (12%), and mild megalocytic anemia (5%). CNS intoxication correlated with high plasma DPH levels, reports of deteriorating behavioral and motor performance, and the findings of nystagmus on vertical gaze or truncal ataxia, though not all patients with high plasma levels were clinically intoxicated. Alarming were the often disfiguring changes of gums and facial structures and the tendency to develop signs of vitamin D deficiency secondary to therapy. Hirsutism was rare in black patients. Plasma DPH level determinations are recommended as part of the management of mentally retarded epileptic patients but do not replace clinical acumen and skill.
Diabetic renal disease has been postulated to progress as a result of an interaction between metabolic and haemodynamic pathways. Our aim was to assess the functional, structural, molecular and cellular aspects of renal disease in an experimental model of diabetes with associated hypertension.
Streptozotocin-induced diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats were randomised to no treatment, the ACE inhibitor, perindopril (2 mg/l), the AGE formation inhibitor, aminoguanidine (1 g/l) and a combination of both agents and were followed for 32 weeks.
Diabetes was associated with a considerable increase in albumin excretion rate. Both aminoguanidine and perindopril retarded the increase in albuminuria, which was completely abrogated by combination therapy. Glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage was reduced by both monotherapies with further renoprotection afforded by combination therapy in both cases. Combination therapy was also associated with a superior restoration in diabetes-induced nephrin protein depletion compared to either monotherapy. TGFbeta1 expression as assessed by in situ hybridisation was increased in the diabetic rats and reduced by perindopril and aminoguanidine.
These findings indicate that in the context of diabetes-related renal injury, blocking both the renin-angiotensin and advanced glycation pathways offers superior renoprotection and could be considered as a therapeutic strategy in the prevention and retardation of progressive-diabetic renal injury.
The incidence of psychosis during clinical trials of topiramate was 0.8%, not significantly different from the rate for placebo or reported rates of psychosis in patients with refractory epilepsy. We observed psychotic symptoms in five patients soon after initiation of topiramate therapy. We performed a retrospective chart review of the first 80 patients who began on topiramate after approval for clinical use, between January and April 1997. Symptoms suggestive of psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions, were sought for analysis. Cognitive effects such as psychomotor slowing, confusion, and somnolence were not included. Five patients developed definite psychotic symptoms 2 to 46 days after beginning topiramate. Dosages at symptom onset were 50-400 mg/day. Symptoms included paranoid delusions in four patients and auditory hallucinations in three. Symptoms of psychosis and other psychiatric symptoms resolved quickly with discontinuation of topiramate in three patients, dose reduction from 300 to 200 mg/day in one and with inpatient treatment and neuroleptics in another. One patient had a history of auditory hallucinations, one of aggressive and suicidal thoughts, but three had no significant psychiatric history. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of psychotic symptoms, even in patients without a previous psychiatric history, when prescribing topiramate. Symptoms resolve quickly with discontinuation.
The ability of flumazenil to reverse the effects of midazolam sedation was examined in a randomised, crossover, placebo controlled study in six male volunteers. Subjects received intravenous injections of either (a) midazolam 10 mg followed 10 minutes later by flumazenil 1.0 mg or (b) midazolam 10 mg followed after 10 minutes by flumazenil 4 mg or (c) placebo followed after 10 minutes by placebo. Post reversal drug effects were examined using a psychomotor battery (critical flicker fusion, digit symbol substitution, tapping test, ball-bearing test, number recall, reflex time) and linear analogue mood scales. It was found that a residual psychomotor deficit was present following flumazenil and that this persisted for up to 125 minutes after the 1.0 mg dose and 65 minutes following 4 mg. A small deterioration in performance was apparent after initial reversal with 1.0 mg, the peak deterioration occurring at 35 minutes.
We have investigated the effect of capsaicin pretreatment (50 mg kg(-1) s.c.) on substance P, preprotachykinin (PPT) mRNA, and nerve growth factor (NGF), plus its high-affinity receptor, trkA, in adult rats with adjuvant arthritis. Twenty one days after induction of adjuvant arthritis, sciatic nerve levels of substance P were significantly increased whilst there was a small but non-significant increase in gamma-PPT mRNA and substance P in L4/L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). NGF levels in sciatic nerve and foot skin as well as DRG trkA mRNA were unaltered after 21 days arthritis suggesting that NGF may not play a role in chronic inflammation. Capsaicin treatment of naive rats significantly reduced substance P in all tissues and NGF levels in the sciatic nerve. In contrast, gamma-PPT mRNA and trkA mRNA expression in DRG were significantly increased after capsaicin treatment. The nervous and skin tissues used in this study were harvested from the same rats in which we had previously shown that capsaicin pretreatment significantly attenuated the severity of arthritis (Cruwys, S.C., Garrett, N.E. and Kidd, B.L., Sensory denervation with capsaicin attenuates inflammation and nociception in arthritic rats, Neurosci. Lett., 193 (1995) 205-207). Arthritis in capsaicin-treated rats had no effect on substance P or NGF levels in any tissue when compared with capsaicin-treated control rats, suggesting that pharmacological impairment of the sensory nervous system can reduce the severity of inflammatory joint disease.
Currently available therapies are unsatisfactory for locally advanced solid tumors of the lung, head and neck, and brain. Laboratory data suggest that the addition of paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Oncology, Princeton, NJ), a microtubule-stabilizing drug, to radiation therapy may result in significant radiation sensitization, perhaps because paclitaxel induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M. Relatively low concentrations, 1 to 10 nmol/L, appear to be optimal for direct cytotoxicity and radiosensitization in vitro. Within this dose range, more prolonged exposure seems to result in higher response rates. We are conducting phase I trials designed to test continuous infusion (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) intravenous paclitaxel combined with standard curative-intent radiation therapy. To date, 22 patients are evaluable, and the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel has not been reached at up to 2.5 mg/m2/d. Observed toxicities include anemia, lymphopenia, mucositis, and cutaneous erythema/desquamation.
Male albino rats were permanently cannulated bilaterally in the caudate/putamen nucleus and subsequently injected unilaterally with cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP. Both of these cyclic nucleotides failed to produce any obvious change in motor activity. The concomitant intrastriatal injection of carbachol and cyclic AMP resulted in enhancement of the carbachol-induced dyskinesias. Under similar conditions, cyclic GMP blocked the carbachol effects. The dibutyryl (db) derivatives of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP both enhanced the carbachol-induced dyskinesias and both db cyclic nucleotides induced dyskinesias when injected intrastriatally alone. The concomitant intrastriatal injection of dopamine and carbachol resulted in a blockade of the carbachol-induced dyskinesias. Dopmaine had no effect on db cyclic AMP and db cyclic GMP dyskinesias. The db cyclic AMP effects characteristically involved the distal limb musculature, while the db cycle GMP effects largely involved the proximal limb and trunk muscles. The hypothesis for opposing action of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in the CNS and the discrepancy between the effects of intrastriatal injection of cyclic AMP and dopamine were discussed.
The metabolic syndrome is a clustering of risk factors of metabolic origin that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. A proposed central event in metabolic syndrome is a decrease in the amount of bioavailable nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Recently, an alternative pathway for NO formation in mammals was described where inorganic nitrate, a supposedly inert NO oxidation product and unwanted dietary constituent, is serially reduced to nitrite and then NO and other bioactive nitrogen oxides. Here we show that several features of metabolic syndrome that develop in eNOS-deficient mice can be reversed by dietary supplementation with sodium nitrate, in amounts similar to those derived from eNOS under normal conditions. In humans, this dose corresponds to a rich intake of vegetables, the dominant dietary nitrate source. Nitrate administration increased tissue and plasma levels of bioactive nitrogen oxides. Moreover, chronic nitrate treatment reduced visceral fat accumulation and circulating levels of triglycerides and reversed the prediabetic phenotype in these animals. In rats, chronic nitrate treatment reduced blood pressure and this effect was also present during NOS inhibition. Our results show that dietary nitrate fuels a nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway that can partly compensate for disturbances in endogenous NO generation from eNOS. These findings may have implications for novel nutrition-based preventive and therapeutic strategies against cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
The daily haloperidol doses of 33 newly admitted, acutely psychotic schizophrenic patients were rapidly adjusted to a point at which slight hypokinesia-rigidity first appeared on clinical examination (the neuroleptic threshold). The mean daily haloperidol dose at which the neuroleptic threshold was crossed was 4.2 +/- 2.4 mg/day. The plasma haloperidol levels obtained at these neuroleptic threshold doses clustered around a mean of 4.9 +/- 2.9 ng/ml. This plasma haloperidol level distribution extensively overlaps the proposed lower boundaries for the therapeutically effective range of plasma haloperidol levels, but it is below the range in which coarse extrapyramidal side effects appear in high frequency (greater than 10 ng/ml). Sixty-seven percent of our patients demonstrated moderate or greater therapeutic improvement within 3 weeks of treatment at neuroleptic threshold doses, a therapeutic efficacy rate identical to that expected with standard neuroleptic doses. The authors propose that the neuroleptic threshold is a readily available clinical marker which identifies a range of plasma haloperidol levels capable of producing therapeutic response with minimal associated coarse extrapyramidal side effects.
Data from the WHO Collaborative Study suggest that use of progestagen preparations with therapeutic indications are associated with a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism but not stroke or myocardial infarction.
Three quinuclidine-based squalene synthase (SQS) inhibitors (BPQ-OH, E5700, and ER-119884) were evaluated against five Candida tropicalis strains with different susceptibility profiles to fluconazole (FLC), itraconazole (ITC), terbinafine (TRB), and amphotericin B (AMB). Although the quinuclidine derivatives were inactive against most C. tropicalis strains tested at concentrations up to 16 μg/ml, E5700 and ER-119884 showed antifungal activity against C. tropicalis ATCC 28707, a strain resistant to FLC, ITC, and AMB, with IC(50) and IC(90) values (i.e., the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the drugs determined as the lowest drug concentrations leading to a 50 and 90% of reduction in turbidity at 492 nm, respectively, after 48 h of incubation) of 1 and 4 μg/ml, respectively. Analysis of free sterols showed that non-treated C. tropicalis ATCC 28707 cells contained only 14-methylated sterols and that treatment with E5700 or ER-119884 led to a marked reduction of squalene content and the complete disappearance of the endogenous sterols. The fatty acid and phospholipid profiles in C. tropicalis ATCC 28707 cells grown in the presence of E5700 and ER-119884 were also markedly altered, with a large increase in the content of linolenic acid (C18:3), associated with a reduction in the content of linoleic (C18:2) and oleic (C18:1) acids. Treatment of C. tropicalis ATCC 28707 with E5700 or ER-119884 IC(50) values induced several ultrastructural alterations, including a marked increase in the thickness of the cell wall and the appearance of a large number of electron-dense vacuoles. In conclusion, our results indicated that E5700 and ER-119884 inhibited the growth and altered the lipid prolife and the ultrastructure of a multiple drug-resistant C. tropicalis strain. Therefore, such compounds could act as leads for the development of new treatment options against multidrug resistant Candida species.
Children with nephrotic syndrome are always associated with retardation of growth. Growth hormone (GH) administration to these children can stimulate their growth, but it plays an important role in glomerulosclerosis. Thus these children would take a risk to use it to improve their growth. This study was designed to investigate the effect of GH on the kidney of rats with adriamycin-induced nephropathy (AN) and its mechanism, and to observe the renoprotective effect of angiotensin II (AngII) receptor antagonist, irbesartan, in GH-treated AN rats.
Rats were divided into the following groups: normal control rats, AN rats, GH-treated AN rats and GH plus irbesartan-treated AN rats. There were 8 developing male SD rats (120-130 g) in each group. Urinary protein was measured at weeks 3, 6 and 9. Blood pressure, serum creatinine, BUN, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, as well as ACE activity and AngII concentration of the kidney were detected at the end of the study. Renal pathological changes were evaluated also. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the protein expressions of TGF beta(1), collagen IV and fibronectin in glomeruli.
Glomerular sclerosis score of GH-treated AN rats (49.4 +/- 9.8) was significantly higher than that of AN rats (12.8 +/- 5.5, P < 0.01), and this score of GH-treated AN rats plus irbesartan (26.2 +/- 7.5) was significantly lower than the score of GH-treated AN rats (P < 0.01). The changes of urinary protein, hyperlipidemia and hypoalbuminemia in rats of each group consisted with the degree of glomerular injury in rats of each group. There was azotemia in GH-treated AN rats, but rats in the other groups did not have azotemia. ACE activity of kidney was significantly (P < 0.01) increased in GH-treated AN rats [(28.1 +/- 4.1) U/mg pro] and GH-treated AN rats plus irbesartan [(27.6 +/- 3.4) U/mg pro] compared with that in AN rats [(14.6 +/- 4.4) U/mg pro]. AngII concentrations in the kidney of GH-treated AN rats [(17.8 +/- 3.3) pg/mg pro] and GH-treated AN rats plus irbesartan [(27.3 +/- 5.1) pg/mg pro] were significantly higher than that in AN rats [(8.3 +/- 1.9) pg/mg pro] (P < 0.01). The protein expressions of TGF-beta(1), collagen IV and fibronectin in GH-treated AN rats were the most distinct in all groups. These expressions were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in GH-treated AN rats plus irbesartan.
GH is able to exacerbate adriamycin-induced nephropathy in rats, which was partly through activating renal tissue RAS and initiating the function of the AngII-TGF beta(1)-ECM axis. Angiotensin II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, has some renal protective effects on AN rats treated with GH.
After brief treatment with 2 different estrogen-progestagen combinations, a previously normotensive 21-year-old woman developed malignant hypertension and progressive and irreversible renal failure. After 4 months of conservative treatment, bilateral nephrectomy was performed, normalizing the blood pressure. Nephrosclerosis was found in both kidneys. It was concluded that 1) oral contraceptives initiated a renal vascular process which was initially blood pressure independent and histologically described as malignant nephrosclerosis with secondary malignant hypertension and renal failure; 2) "primary" malignant nephrosclerosis should be differentiated from the "secondary" form, which results from accelerated hypertension; 3) the blood pressure should be checked regularly during the 1st months of oral contraceptive treatment.
Biologically based dose-response models can provide a framework for incorporating mechanistic information into our assessments of neurotoxicity considering both kinetic and dynamic processes. We have constructed models for normal midbrain and neocortex development and we have extended these models to evaluate the neurodevelopmental toxicity of ethanol and methyl mercury. Using such modeling approaches, we have been able to test hypothesized modes of action for these neurodevelopmental toxicants. Specifically, we have compared ethanol's effects on neocortical neurogenesis and exacerbation of apoptosis during the synaptogenesis period. We have used methylmercury as an example of how one can link toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic models and also as an example of how mechanistic data on gene expression can support model development. In summary, using examples from our research group, this paper illustrates the need for models that evaluate both qualitative and quantitative kinetic and dynamic factors in order to understand the potential impacts of neurodevelopmental toxicants.
Vanadium, a trace element in human cells and regarded as an essential nutrient, plays an active role in all tissues. It is known that peroxovanadate-nicotinic acid (POV), a complex compound of vanadium, can decrease hyperglycemia; however, its biochemical mechanism remains unclear. The object of the present study is to explore the hypoglycemia mechanism of POV at gene molecular levels. Rats rendered diabetic with streptozotocin were treated with POV. Total RNA was isolated from rat liver, and phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) mRNA abundance was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. PAH activity, blood glucose, and lipid levels were measured. Significantly increased hepatic PAH activity and corresponding mRNA with concomitant hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia were found in diabetic rats. These levels returned to normal after POV treatment and accompanied by negative glucosuria, normoglycemia, and normolipemia. The results from the current study indicates one of the mechanisms of POV action is to inhibit PAH gene expression and PAH activity, thus decreasing gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia. At the same time, POV is able to promote diabetic recovery by lowering hyperlipemia.
