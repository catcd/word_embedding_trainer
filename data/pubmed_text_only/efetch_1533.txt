Interactions between nicotine and learning could contribute to nicotine addiction. Although previous research indicates that nicotine withdrawal disrupts contextual learning, the effects of nicotine withdrawal on contextual memories acquired before withdrawal are unknown. The present study investigated whether nicotine withdrawal disrupted recall of prior contextual memories by examining the effects of nicotine withdrawal on recall of nicotine conditioned place preference (CPP) and contextual fear conditioning. C57BL/6J mice trained in CPP exhibited a significant preference for an initially non-preferred chamber that was paired with 0.35 mg/kg nicotine. Following CPP, mice were implanted with mini-osmotic pumps containing 6.3 mg/kg/d nicotine or saline. Pumps were removed twelve days later and nicotine CPP was retested 24 h later. Mice withdrawn from chronic nicotine exhibited CPP, suggesting that older drug-context associations are not disrupted by nicotine withdrawal. One hour later, the same mice were trained in contextual and cued fear conditioning; nicotine withdrawal disrupted contextual but not cued fear conditioning. A subsequent experiment demonstrated that nicotine withdrawal did not disrupt recall of contextual or cued fear conditioning when acquisition occurred before nicotine withdrawal. These data suggest that nicotine withdrawal disrupts new contextual learning, but does not alter contextual learning that occurred before withdrawal.
We sought to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with mild statin-induced side effects.
Statin-induced side effects can interfere with therapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 enzymes impair statin metabolism; the reduced function SLCO1B1*5 allele impairs statin clearance and is associated with simvastatin-induced myopathy with creatine kinase (CK) elevation.
The STRENGTH (Statin Response Examined by Genetic Haplotype Markers) study was a pharmacogenetics study of statin efficacy and safety. Subjects (n = 509) were randomized to atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 10 mg followed by 80 mg, 80 mg, and 40 mg, respectively. We defined a composite adverse event (CAE) as discontinuation for any side effect, myalgia, or CK >3x upper limit of normal during follow-up. We sequenced CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and SLCO1B1 and tested 7 reduced function alleles for association with the CAE.
The CAE occurred in 99 subjects (54 discontinuations, 49 myalgias, and 9 CK elevations). Sex was associated with CAE (percent female in CAE vs. no CAE groups, 66% vs. 50%, p < 0.01). SLCO1B1*5 was associated with CAE (percent with > or = 1 allele in CAE vs. no CAE groups, 37% vs. 25%, p = 0.03) and those with CAE with no significant CK elevation (p < or = 0.03). Furthermore, there was evidence for a gene-dose effect (percent with CAE in those with 0, 1, or 2 alleles: 19%, 27%, and 50%, trend p = 0.01). Finally, the CAE risk appeared to be greatest in those carriers assigned to simvastatin.
SLCO1B1*5 genotype and female sex were associated mild statin-induced side effects. These findings expand the results of a recent genome-wide association study of statin myopathy with CK >3x normal to milder, statin-induced, muscle side effects.
A female infant exposed in utero to anticonvulsant therapy had bilateral encephaloceles, ventricular abnormalities, and defective neuronal migration. This is one of a few articles with pathologic data available that discusses central nervous system involvement in infants exposed to anticonvulsants.
While the intentional modification of eating habits remains the most important measure for losing weight, pharmacological support, in particular with regard to the long-term outcome, can be helpful. Catacholaminergic substances, such as diethylpropion and phenylpropanolamine are restricted by their side effects to short-term application only, and their use makes little sense. The serotoninergic substance sibutramine, which acts on the central nervous system to curb the appetite or enhance the feeling of saturation, and orlistat, which inhibits the assimilation of fat from the bowel, are approved for longer-term treatment of obesity, and lead to an additional loss of 3-5% of the patient's initial weight after one year of use. Thereafter, however, this benefit decreases. Further substances involving new, possibly combinable, approaches are currently under development.
We report two cases of seizure activity due to theophylline overdose with serum levels of theophylline of 26 and 26.3 micrograms/dl. Both patients had evidence of prior neurologic damage. A review of the literature is presented with discussion of the possible mechanism of this reaction at relatively low serum levels of the drug. In the patient with evidence of prior neurologic damage, frequent and careful monitoring of serum theophylline levels should be done. We concluded that drug dosage should be reduced and the possibility of seizure activity at lower serum concentration than would be otherwise anticipated should be kept in mind.
Fourteen patients with a history of mania satisfying DSM-III criteria were entered into a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, spending four weeks on each of lithium and placebo. All patients had been well and stable on lithium for at least 18 months and were not taking any other psychotropic drugs. Seven patients (50%) had a relapse of their manic illness and a further two had to be withdrawn because they recognised signs of incipient relapse. One of these became overtly manic after restarting lithium. The seven definite and the two possible relapses occurred in the placebo phase; this finding was unlikely to have arisen by chance. The relapses started 13-19 days after placebo substitution. These results have important implications in the management of lithium prophylaxis by all doctors, particularly those who, for any reason, are considering withdrawal of lithium from their patients.
The mechanisms involved in development of cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes mellitus are not well elucidated. Among the vasoactive factors that may play a role in development of these complications are angiotensin II and thromboxane B2 (TXB2). We hypothesized that diabetes increases renal production of TXB2 through stimulation of angiotensin type-1 receptor.
We used a microdialysis technique to monitor changes in renal interstitial fluid (RIF) TXB2 in conscious streptozotocin-induced diabetes rat model. The RIF levels of angiotensin II and TXB2 were monitored before and during 6 weeks after development of diabetes and during treatment with the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker valsartan at 10 mg/kg. Measurement of the urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was used to monitor the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy.
The UAE was 81.62 +/- 1.31 ng/min, 184.75 +/- 9.41 ng/min (P < .01), and 229.84 +/- 4.49 ng/min (P < .0001) at baseline, week 3, and week 6, respectively, after induction of diabetes. Basal levels of RIF angiotensin II were 4.28 +/- 0.02 pg/mL and significantly increased to 6.24 +/- 0.31 pg/mL (P < .001) and 7.66 +/- 0.05 pg/mL (P < .001) at 3 and 6 weeks after development of diabetes. Similarly, basal RIF TXB2 was 197 +/- 27 pg/mL and increased to 488 +/- 80 pg/mL (P < .01) and 703 +/- 130 pg/mL (P < .01) at 3 and 6 weeks after development of diabetes. Valsartan caused further increase in RIF angiotensin II levels. In contrast, valsartan decreased RIF TXB2 levels at baseline to 85 +/- 11 pg/mL (P < .01), at 3 weeks to 141 +/- 17 pg/mL (P < .01), and at 6 weeks to 255 +/- 45 pg/mL (P < .01) after development of diabetes.
These results demonstrate that diabetes mellitus is accompanied by increased renal production of angiotensin II and TXB2. The increase in TXB2 is mediated through stimulation of angiotensin type-1 receptor.
The effects of 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), sodium phenobarbital (PB) and 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDPM) on the developmental sequence of N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM) induced changes in the rat liver was investigated using a histological, histochemical and morphometric approach. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with NNM for 3 weeks, maintained on basal diet for 1 week and then fed on diets containing either 0.005% 2-AAF, 0.05% PB, 0.08% DDPM or, as carcinogen controls, no addition (basal diet, BD) for a further 48 weeks. Control and experimental groups were sacrificed at weeks 4, 16, 28, 40 and 52 of the investigation. The incidence of the hepatocellular carcinomas observed at weeks 40 and 52 was markedly enhanced by 2-AAF treatment and slightly increased after PB administration. 2-AAF also exerted a positive influence on the development of angiosarcomas, benign hemangioendotheliomas and cystic cholangiomas. DDPM did not show clear effects on the development of liver cell carcinoma but enhanced the induction of cholangiofibromas, cholangiofibrosis and, very markedly, spongiosis hepatis. No neoplastic lesions were observed in animals treated with 2-AAF, PB or DDPM without prior application of NNM. Morphometric analysis of enzyme-altered foci revealed contrasting effects of 2-AAF, PB and DDPM, not only on number and size of lesion but also on their histochemical phenotype. Thus whilst 2-AAF administration was primarily linked with increase in number of lesions, PB appeared to stabilise their phenotypic cellular changes and increased the activity of G6PDH. DDPM did not significantly influence the number of focal lesions but seemed to effect a decrease in phenotypic alteration within foci. The results suggest that changes in the nature of enzyme-altered foci may be correlated with enhancement or inhibition of tumorigenesis.
Fenofibrate (FF), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist, has been used as one of the hypolipidemic drugs in man and induces oxidative stress and promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in the liver of rodents. This chemical belongs to a class of non-genotoxic carcinogens, but DNA damage secondary to oxidative stress resulting from reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is suspected in rodents given this chemical. To examine whether FF has genotoxic potential, partially hepatectomized F344 male rats were treated orally with 0, 1,000 or 2,000 mg/kg of FF for 2 weeks, followed by diet containing 0.15% 2 acetyl aminofluorene (2 AAF) for enhancement the tumor-promoting effect for 10 days and a single oral dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) as the first experiment (liver initiation assay). As the second experiment, the in vivo liver comet assay was performed in hepatectomized rats, and the expression of some DNA repair genes was examined. In the liver initiation assay, the number and area of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive single cells and foci did not increase in the FF treated groups. In the comet assay, positive results were obtained after 3 h of the last treatment of FF, and the expression of some DNA repair genes such as Apex1, Ogg1 and Mlh1 were upregulated in rats given the high dose of FF at 3 h after the treatment but not in 24 h after the treatment. The results of the present study suggest that FF causes some DNA damage in livers of rats, but is not a strong genotoxic substance leading to a DNA mutation since such DNA damage was repaired by the increased activity of some DNA repair genes.
Retinoids regulate key developmental pathways throughout life, and have potential uses for differentiation therapy. It should be possible to identify novel retinoids by coupling new chemical reactions with screens using the zebrafish embryonic model.
We synthesized novel retinoid analogues and derivatives by amide coupling, obtaining 80-92% yields. A small library of these compounds was screened for bioactivity in living zebrafish embryos. We found that several structurally related compounds significantly affect development. Distinct phenotypes are generated depending on time of exposure, and we characterize one compound (BT10) that produces specific cardiovascular defects when added 1 day post fertilization. When compared to retinoic acid (ATRA), BT10 shows similar but not identical changes in the expression pattern of embryonic genes that are known targets of the retinoid pathway. Reporter assays determined that BT10 interacts with all three RAR receptor sub-types, but has no activity for RXR receptors, at all concentrations tested.
Our screen has identified a novel retinoid with specificity for retinoid receptors. This lead compound may be useful for manipulating components of retinoid signaling networks, and may be further derivatized for enhanced activity.
Experimental findings suggest that the obese Zucker rat (OZR) is a model of type 2 diabetes-related nephropathy with several metabolic abnormalities. However, the exact mechanisms by which these factors cause early glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria remain unclear. Furthermore, structural abnormalities and regulation of podocytes have recently emerged as prominent underlying factors in proteinuria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins on early podocyte damage in an experimental model of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We used OZR to evaluate some of the pathogenic mechanisms and the effects of two drugs, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (quinapril) and a statin (atorvastatin), involved in the development of proteinuria and especially podocyte damage. We studied glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury by assessing inflammation mediators (murine monoclonal antibody against CD68 [ED1+], interleukin-8 [IL-8], interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 [IP-10]) and podocyte damage markers using desmin staining and electron microscopy.
Glomerular lesions were correlated with cholesterol (r = 0.676), proteinuria (r = 0.804), triglycerides (r = 0.593), insulin (r = 0.345), creatinine (r = 0.266), and glucose (r = 0.245). In addition, podocytes from OZR showed positive staining for desmin. Use of the ACE inhibitor quinapril normalized proteinuria, cholesterol levels, glomerular lesions, and podocyte morphology. In contrast, atorvastatin ameliorated but did not normalize renal damage, with a partial reduction in desmin staining and podocyte morphology. Treatment with both drugs resulted in only a slight reduction in IL-8 and IP-10 in the tubulointerstitium.
In the OZR, cholesterol was an important determinant of renal injury. Most notably, glomerulosclerosis in the OZR Is characterized by early podocyte damage and tubulointerstitial injury. In addition, our findings showed that quinapril primarily normalized podocyte morphology, whereas atorvastatin ameliorated renal lesions through the diminution of lipids and by its lipid-independent pleiotropic effect.
Although Behçet's disease (BD) is a multisystem disorder of unknown causes, both genetic and environmental factors have been suggested. This is the second reported case of monozygotic twins concordant for Behçet's disease and the first such report of intestinal Behçet's disease. Patient 1 was a 17-year-old man with fever, recurrent oral aphthae, and skin eruptions. He developed hematochezia and was given corticosteroid empirically. One month after he was discharged, he again developed oral ulcerations, fever, and hematochezia. Colonoscopy was performed again, showing aphthous ulcerations in the entire colon, and deep oval ulcers with marginal elevation around the ileocecal valve, which are characteristics of intestinal Behçet's disease. He was treated with colchicine and azathioprine in combination with salazosulfapyridine (SASP) and prednisolone (PSL) and achieved remission. Patient 2 was the twin brother of patient 1. He was admitted because of oral aphthous ulcerations, fever, pustules on his face and body, and genital ulcers. Two weeks later he developed hematochezia. Colonoscopic and barium enema findings were similar to those of his brother. SASP, PSL, colchicines, and azathioprine were also required to achieve remission. Both of the patients were diagnosed with intestinal Behçet's disease. Their monozygosity was confirmed by detailed genetic typing, and HLA-B51 was negative.
In 17 previous cases of dermatological disorders, an axonal motor neuropathy was described as a dapsone (DDS) therapy side effect. In this study, we attempted to assess DDS-induced neuropathy in the ulnar and popliteal nerves of 39 tuberculoid Hansen's disease patients using electrophysiological recordings at the time of DDS withdrawal, owing to dermatological improvement, and 4 months after. Distal motor latencies, conduction velocities at forearm and leg and above the epicondyle and the neck of the fibula were improved at a highly significant level. Twenty-five percent of the patients presented abnormal values (outside of the 95% confidence interval) at the first recording session compared to those at the second session. By contrast, parameters exploring the degree of innervation of distal muscles showed a progressive denervation. These results lead to an impairment of Hansen's disease neuropathy during DDS therapy affecting the motor conduction velocities of one quarter of the patients, and are discussed in terms of physiopathological mechanisms.
We report the clinical features, electrophysiologic findings, and dapsone and isoniazid excretion studies in three young people who ingested excessive amounts (2-4 times the prescribed dose) of dapsone for hypopigmented macules and who developed, subacutely, progressive motor neuropathy a few months later. Pathologic studies on a biopsied motor nerve confirmed the electrophysiologic conclusion of distal motor axonopathy. All made a rapid recovery in a few months after dapsone was stopped, although electrical abnormalities persisted. One patient was a rapid acetylator of isoniazid.
The perception of pruritus is modified by endogenous and exogenous opioids via central opiate receptors and can be suppressed with opioid receptor antagonists. The aim of this investigation was to describe the efficacy and safety of naltrexone, an orally active opiate antagonist, in the treatment of severe, otherwise intractable pruritus of varying origins.
A total of 133 patients with pruritus caused by inflammatory skin diseases (asteatotic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, prurigo, and psoriasis vulgaris), liver- and renal diseases, cutaneous lymphoma, as well as with pruritus of unknown origin were treated with naltrexone (Nemexin) 50 to 150 mg daily.
A therapeutic response was achieved in 86 of the 133 (64.6%) patients. Naltrexone was most effective in prurigo nodularis, cutaneous lymphoma and pruritus of unknown origin. Tachyphylaxis occurred in 13% of the patients, but appeared late, and could be counterbalanced by raising the dosage. Adverse drug effects were restricted to the first two weeks of treatment and included mainly neurological (dizziness, headache, fatigue) and gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) symptoms.
The oral opiate antagonists may well be an effective, well-tolerated therapy for intractable pruritus in many diseases.
A study of equivalence was performed between two low molecular weight heparins, reviparin-sodium (Clivarin) and enoxaparin (Lovenox) in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after total hip replacement. Nineteen orthopaedic centres participated in the trial. Four hundred and ninety-eight patients were randomized; 247 received reviparin-sodium and 251 enoxaparin; 58 patients were excluded. Each patient received subcutaneous prophylaxis begun 10-12 h pre-operatively and the second injection 10-12 h post-operatively and thereafter every 24 h. In the enoxaparin group 18 DVT were observed (9%); of these 13 (6%) were proximal. In the reviparin-sodium group 21 DVT were observed (10%); 12 (6%) were proximal. The study showed that the efficacy of both LMWHs was equivalent as was the clinical tolerance. There was a slight trend in favour of reviparin-sodium as regards haemoglobin level, and wound haematoma. Anti-factor Xa activity was significantly different despite similar injected doses.
Pulmonary vascular injury by toxins can induce neointimal formation, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), right ventricular failure, and death. We showed previously that simvastatin attenuates smooth muscle neointimal proliferation and pulmonary hypertension in pneumonectomized rats injected with the alkaloid toxin monocrotaline. The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of simvastatin and its mechanism of reversing established neointimal vascular occlusion and pulmonary hypertension.
Pneumonectomized rats injected with monocrotaline at 4 weeks demonstrated severe PAH at 11 weeks (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP]=42 versus 17 mm Hg in normal rats) and death by 15 weeks. When rats with severe PAH received simvastatin (2 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) by gavage) from week 11, there was 100% survival and reversal of PAH after 2 weeks (mPAP=36 mm Hg) and 6 weeks (mPAP=24 mm Hg) of therapy. Simvastatin treatment reduced right ventricular hypertrophy and reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of pathological smooth muscle cells in the neointima and medial walls of pulmonary arteries. Longitudinal transcriptional profiling revealed that simvastatin downregulated the inflammatory genes fos, jun, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and upregulated the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1a.
Simvastatin reverses pulmonary arterial neointimal formation and PAH after toxic injury.
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is a neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of an uninterrupted glutamine repeat in ataxin-1 protein. Protein aggregation and immunoreactivity to 1C2 monoclonal antibody are two distinct pathognomonic features of expanded ataxin-1, as well as of other polyglutamine disorders. Rare cases of non-affected elderly subjects carrying expanded ataxin-1 alleles were found in random population. However, in these alleles the glutamine stretch was interrupted by histidines. Due to lack of phenotype, these alleles should be considered "normal". Most importantly, occurrence of these unusual alleles provides a unique opportunity to investigate which molecular properties of expanded ataxin-1 are not coupled to polyglutamine pathogenesis. Towards this goal, we compared in vitro the immunoreactivity to 1C2 antibody and the ability to form aggregates of interrupted and uninterrupted alleles. Immunoblotting showed that expanded-interrupted ataxin-1 had an affinity to 1C2 resembling that of normal ataxin-1. On the contrary, filter assay showed that aggregation rate of expanded-interrupted ataxin-1 resembles that of expanded-uninterrupted ataxin-1. These observations indicate that affinity for 1C2 does not directly correlate with self-aggregation of ataxin-1. Moreover, self-aggregation is not directly affected by histidine interruptions. In conclusion, these results support the hypothesis that mechanisms underlying neuronal degeneration are triggered by protein misfolding rather than by protein aggregation.
The search for more effective and less toxic immunosuppressive agents to control transplant rejection has led to the extensive testing of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in clinical renal transplantation.
A pooled analysis of three phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trials conducted in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia was performed to further characterize the efficacy of MMF in renal allograft recipients. The three studies enrolled a total of 1493 patients. Triple- and quadruple-therapy regimens of cyclosporine, corticosteroids, and standardized MMF dosages with and without antilymphocyte induction were used: MMF in twice-daily doses of 1.0 g or 1.5 g (MMF 2 g or 3 g) was compared with placebo (PLA) or azathioprine (AZA). The primary efficacy endpoint in the individual trials was biopsy-proven rejection or treatment failure at 6 months. This pooled analysis focused on graft loss, patient death, incidence and treatment of rejection episodes, and graft function (serum creatinine) at 1 year.
At 1 year, the graft survival rate was 90.4% and 89.2% in the MMF 2 g and 3 g groups, respectively, compared with 87.6% in the PLA/AZA group. This difference was not statistically significant. MMF significantly reduced the incidence of rejection episodes: 40.8% for PLA/AZA patients versus 19.8% and 16.5% for the MMF 2 g and MMF 3 g groups, respectively. Renal function was consistently better for both MMF treatment groups at 3, 6, and 12 months.
MMF proved superior to AZA as a posttransplant immunosuppressant in conjunction with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. MMF-treated groups showed reduced incidence and severity of rejection episodes, similar graft survival, and better graft function over 12 months.
Hyperhomocysteinemia is characterized by an increase of plasma homocysteine, a thiol-containing amino acid produced during methionine metabolism. Hyperhomocysteinemia has often been associated with coronary artery disease, vascular thrombosis and the development of premature atherosclerosis. We have recently demonstrated that the supplementation of catechin, a polyphenol found in the red wine, significantly reduced plasma homocysteine level in cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficient mice, a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of another well-studied polyphenol found in red wine, resveratrol, on hyperhomocysteinemia. After two months on high methionine diet, heterozygous Cbs deficient mice were administrated the resveratrol in drinking water (0.001%) for one month. High methionine diet significantly increased serum homocysteine levels, and decreased the serum activity of HDL-associated enzyme paraoxonase-1. Chronic administration of resveratrol significantly increased plasma homocysteine level, which was associated with a decreased serum paraoxonase-1 activity, in hyperhomocysteinemic mice. Then we looked at gene expression of several proteins involved in HDL stability and found a down-regulation of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. In conclusion, we found a deleterious effect of resveratrol onto homocysteine and HDL metabolism in a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia.
This is an open non-comparative study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of doxazosin mesilate in 540 subjects with either history or newly diagnosed mild/moderate hypertension. In all adult subjects of both sexes enrolled in this study, the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was in the range of 95-115 mmHg at two different measurements both in clino- and orthostatism, in the absence of any heart pathology. Those patients who, after one-week wash-out period, reported DPB > or = 95 mmHg, were given doxazosin as a single daily dose. The initial dosage was 1 mg for three days; afterwards, patients have been instructed to take a whole 2 mg tablet in the morning up to the following visit (i.e. 14 days after the first administration). In case < or = 90 mmHg DBP control could not be obtained, the dosage has been increased to 4 mg and if after the same interval of time (i.e. 14 days) DPB control could not be achieved, the dosage was increased up to 8 mg (2 x 4 mg tablets) and/or the concomitant administration of another antihypertensive drug was instituted. At the beginning and at the end of the study blood collection for lipid profile determinations (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides), routine tests and complete urinalysis were performed. The onset of side-effects was reported in 84 (15.5%) subjects and only 13 (2.4%) of them had to discontinue the therapy. A comparative analysis of the incidence of side-effects between the total number of patients and those aged > or = 65 yrs. has not shown a significant difference. At week 24, a total of 540 subjects had completed the treatment. BP value normalization has been achieved with a mean dosage of 3.1 +/- 1.2 mg/day of doxazosin. Doxazosin administration did not produce clinically significant effects on heart rate. Laboratory data have evidenced a statistically significant increase in HDL cholesterol (p < 0.0001) and a significant reduction of mean values of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides (p < 0.0001) at week 24, with respect to baseline. In the group of patients aged > or = 65 yrs. (116 patients) only a delta/percentage variation of HDL cholesterol with respect to baseline has been evidenced, after 24 weeks of treatment.
Distortion products are currently considered an objective method for rapidly evaluating the functional status of the cochlea, which is interesting for the monitoring of drug ototoxicity. We studied 40 ears from patients who had received an ototoxic drug, tobramycin. Two consecutive measurements were made using distortion products 2f1-f2, before and after taking the ototoxic agent. A significant reduction was observed in the amplitudes of the DP-grams. At the same time, we evaluated the influence of previous hearing loss on the DP-grams and divided the patients into two groups: normal hearing and sensorineural hearing loss. Patients were evaluated at the same time by conventional audiometry to compare the effect of tobramycin on both tests. To conclude, tobramycin had little effect on audiometric thresholds, but produced an evident change in the amplitude of the distortion products.
Notwithstanding the large number of clinical trials, most of them designed and performed according to the requirements of modern clinical pharmacology, only a few firm clinical recommendations on drugs affecting platelet function in the prevention of arterial or venous thrombosis can be made at present. There is no good evidence for the clinical effectiveness of aspirin or any other drug affecting platelet function in patients with peripheral arterial occlusion or after vascular grafting. In cerebrovascular disease there is reasonable evidence that the administration of sulfinpyrazone can significantly reduce cerebral ischemia or mortality, but similar trials performed with aspirin, dipyridamole or clofibrate failed to reveal a significant difference in favor of the experimental treatment. Patients with angina only were shown to benefit from treatment with clofibrate, but prospective trials with dipyridamole or aspirin in the primary or secondary prevention of myocardial infarction did not reveal a significant reduction in morbidity or mortality in the experimental group. Use of a combination of the latter two drugs did, however, reveal a reduction in morbidity and mortality. In patients with prosthetic heart valves, there is firm evidence that dipyridamole and sulfinpyrazone therapy can normalize decreased platelet survival, an effect which has been shown to correlate well with the incidence of thromboembolism. Provided further trials lead to confirmatory conclusions, drugs inhibiting platelet function associated or not with oral anticoagulants may constitute an ideal prophylaxis in patients with a substitute valve. There is still much uncertainty as to whether dipyridamole, given in addition to conventional treatment, benefits patients with membranous or mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. The same holds for drugs inhibiting platelet function after kidney or heart transplantation in man. Only scanty reports are available on the usefulness of drugs affecting platelet function in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Three different types of antiplatelet drugs are available for the prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis: dextran, oral drugs also affecting platelet function and heparin administered subcutaneously in small doses. In orthopedic surgery dextran 70 administered before and every second day after surgery was the drug showing the most convincing reduction in the incidence of phlebographically proved deep vein thrombosis. Major orthopedic surgery is precisely the type of surgery in which the effectiveness of small dose heparin is much in doubt and in which the effectiveness of aspirin and dipyridamole is still to be confirmed. In general surgery, use of a combination of 1 g aspirin and 0.225 g dipyridamole daily was shown to offer approximately the same level of protection as small doses of heparin, land these two forms of prevention seem to offer a greater degree of protection than dextran...
Metallothionein (MT) is a free radical scavenger induced by inflammatory stimuli; however, its roles in inflammation have not been fully investigated. In the present study, we genetically determined the role of MT in ozone (O(3))-induced lung inflammation using MT-I/II null (-/-) mice. Subacute (65 h) exposure to O(3) (0.3 ppm) induced lung inflammation and enhanced vascular permeability, which was significantly greater in MT(-/-) than in corresponding wild-type mice. Electron microscopically, O(3) exposure induced vacuolar degeneration of pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells, and interstitial edema with focal loss of the basement membrane, which was more prominent in MT(-/-) than in wild-type mice. O(3) -induced lung expression of interleukin-6 was significantly greater in MT(-/-) than in wild-type mice; however, lung expression of the chemokines examined was comparable in both genotypes of mice in the presence of O(3). Following O(3) exposure, the formation of oxidative stress-related molecules/adducts, such as heme oxidase-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and nitrotyrosine, in the lung was significantly greater in MT(-/-) than in wild-type mice. Collectively, MT protects against O(3)-induced lung inflammation, at least partly, via the regulation of pulmonary endothelial and epithelial integrity and its antioxidative property.
