The overall survival of patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity with localized disease has greatly improved in recent decades and today about half of them are long-term survivors (i.e. more than 10 years). Owing to the increased number of long-term survivors, late side effects of combined chemotherapy are more evident and have been better studied. Doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity is still an important and ominous side effect even if the percentage of affected patients is low. In this study, we report the incidence of clinically symptomatic cardiac toxicity induced by doxorubicin, in our series of 755 patients with localized osteosarcoma of the extremity, who had been treated from 1983 to 2000 with different protocols at our institution. Thirteen (1.7%) patients developed a clinically symptomatic cardiac toxicity (New York Heart Association class II-IV). Six of them died. Of the seven still alive, three needed a heart transplant. The case report of these 13 patients is described in detail. A higher incidence of cardiac toxicity was noted in women patients (eight women=2.5% and five men=1.1%). Cumulative dose and dose intensity (cumulative dose/week of treatment) are the most important risk factors in developing doxorubicin-related cardiomyopathy.
A 65-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial flutter was treated with digoxin and flecainide. The atrial flutter rate was slowed to 190 beats per minute but at times 1:1 AV conduction occurred.
Psychiatric complications from nonpsychiatric medications are common. Our understanding of these phenomena is often limited, due to the relative infrequency of their occurrence for individual agents and the complexity of the pharmacological systems involved. This case report presents a patient who developed psychiatric sequelae following the administration of metoclopramide. Akathisia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and major depressive disorder all developed sequentially after only 2 days of exposure to metoclopramide, leading to months of disability. Dopaminergic blockade was implicated as the precipitating pharmacological event. The pharmacology of benzamides is reviewed, as is the literature concerning benzamide-induced extrapyramidal and psychiatric symptoms. Finally, potential pharmacological mechanisms regarding these complications are discussed, with particular attention to the role of interactions between dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.
Fifty-one bipolar patients receiving maintenance lithium treatment were evaluated for the presence of side effects, their degree of distress, and the association of these side effects with compliance. Cognitive side effects and weight gain were the most disturbing to patients, whereas thirst and polyuria were the most common. Self-reported noncompliance correlated most highly with coordination (r = .38, p less than .01) and cognition (r = .30, p less than .05) side effects. Current depressed mood also showed a strong correlation with side effect scores, especially those for cognitive disturbances. However, the correlations between noncompliance and coordination and cognitive side effects were just as strong when the effects of depressed mood were partialled out. These findings indicate the link between noncompliance and lithium-induced central nervous side effects and suggest that related treatment issues must be addressed to ensure maximum clinical response.
A case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) was induced by the antidepressant trimipramine in a 47-year-old woman with obsessive compulsive disorder and major depression. NMS symptoms were associated with a brief episode of polydipsia, and both conditions may have had dopaminergic dysfunction as a common etiology. The patient improved with bromocriptine and dantrolene.
This randomized crossover out-patient study was designed to compare the antihypertensive effects of atenolol and pindolol. After a wash-out period of two weeks in pretreated cases, 107 patients with essential hypertension were given either atenolol 100 mg once-daily or pindolol 20 mg slow release (SR) once-daily. Both atenolol and pindolol lowered blood pressure over the 24 week period. The diastolic blood pressure reduction was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) with atenolol than with pindolol. Before beta-blocker therapy, many patients had already experienced side-effects such as fatigue, sleep disturbances and dreams. This probably relates to the high sensitivity of the analogue scale used to assess side-effects, and to the high incidence of such symptoms in untreated patients. As the study progressed there was a reduction in the frequency of fatigue (p less than 0.03) and dreams (p less than 0.05) in both groups, whereas sleep disturbances significantly increased under pindolol (p less than 0.05) but decreased under atenolol (p less than 0.05). The only important side-effect difference between the two beta-blockers was the higher incidence of sleep disturbances with pindolol which may be due to the higher lipophilicity of this beta-blocker.
Vivid and bizarre dreams, hallucinations, sleep disturbance and psychosis have all been described following treatment with beta-blockers. It has been suggested that these central nervous system (CNS) side-effects are related to the degree of lipophilicity of the beta-blocker. A randomized double-blind crossover study was performed to compare the incidence of CNS side-effects with atenolol and metoprolol in hypertensive patients who had reported CNS side-effects with lipophilic beta-blockers. Eleven women and six men completed the study, in which a 30-item psychiatric questionnaire was used to detect changes in psychological status and possible CNS side-effects. Discontinuation of the original lipophilic beta-blocker produced a significant improvement in quality of sleep, dreams, concentration, memory, energy, and anxiety. No significant CNS side-effects were reported with atenolol, but introduction of metoprolol caused a significant increase in the incidence of sleep disturbance (p less than 0.01) and restless nights (p less than 0.05), as well as failure to achieve satisfactory sexual intercourse (p less than 0.05). When compared with atenolol, metoprolol was associated with a significantly higher incidence of restless disturbed nights (p less than 0.05). Blood pressure control was identical for both beta-blockers. This study appears to confirm the association between CNS-related side-effects and the lipophilicity of beta-blockers.
Several lines of evidence suggest that the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is involved in the antipsychotic efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic agent clozapine. Clinical data on the interaction between clozapine's mechanism of action and NMDA receptor function have been lacking secondary to a paucity of pharmacologic probes of the NMDA system. We have utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled infusion paradigm with subanesthetic doses of the NMDA antagonist ketamine to test the hypothesis that clozapine would blunt ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Ten schizophrenic patients underwent ketamine infusions while antipsychotic drug free and also during treatment with clozapine. Antipsychotic drug-free patients experienced increases in ratings of positive and negative symptoms. Clozapine treatment significantly blunted the ketamine-induced increase in positive symptoms. These data suggest that NMDA receptor function may be involved in the unique antipsychotic efficacy of clozapine.
Esorubicin (4'-deoxydoxorubicin, DxDx) has undergone extensive Phase II investigation for the treatment of cancer. Based on in vitro and animal data, esorubicin may possess less myocardial toxicity when compared to doxorubicin. One hundred thirty-six patients with histologically or cytologically documented non-small cell lung cancer or advanced breast cancer were enrolled in two concurrent CALGB clinical trials using esorubicin at a dose of 30 mg/m2 administered intravenously every 21 days. No patient had previously received an anthracycline agent or had evidence of severe cardiovascular disease. Cardiotoxicity was observed in eleven patients. Four patients developed symptoms of congestive heart failure and three asymptomatic patients had a significant fall in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as measured by gated pool heart scan. Four patients had cardiac signs or symptoms of indeterminate relationship to esorubicin therapy. Of 44 patients receiving more than four cycles of therapy, 36 patients (82%) had serial gated pool heart scans permitting assessment of subclinical myocardial toxicity. A 5% drop in LVEF was observed following approximately 240 mg/m2 esorubicin; a 10% drop was observed after approximately 480 mg/m2. If further clinical studies are undertaken with esorubicin, investigators are advised to monitor cardiac function frequently once the cumulative esorubicin dose exceeds 240 mg/m2. If congestive failure appears during therapy, prompt cessation of esorubicin and institution of inotropic agents may provide effective palliation. Normal myocardial function may be restored within several months.
In a group of newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) children we evaluated a number of hemostatic and inflammatory markers at diagnosis and at different time points during chemotherapy for the remission induction to identify alterations in the plasma levels of prothrombotic markers before and during the course of chemotherapy. The following plasma markers were evaluated: thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), D-Dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), antithrombin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and high molecular weight VWF (HMW-VWF) multimers, P-selectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Plasma samples were collected at the following time points: at T0 (baseline) and T1 (+24 days of therapy), T2 (+36 days therapy), and T3 (+64 days therapy). The results show that, at diagnosis, ALL children presented with laboratory signs of increased thrombin generation and fibrin formation (i.e. high TAT and D-dimer levels), fibrinolysis inhibition (i.e. high PAI-1 level), endothelial activation (i.e., high HMW-VWF and soluble P-selectin levels) and inflammation (i.e. high TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels). After starting induction therapy, the thrombin generation markers and inflammatory cytokines significantly decreased. To the opposite, PAI-1 and P-selectin significantly increased, suggesting an insult by chemotherapy on the vascular endothelium. These effects were more evident during steroid administration. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) episodes developed in two cases during induction therapy, which did not allow the evaluation of the predictive value for VTE of laboratory markers.
Recurrence of hyperprolactinemia after cabergoline withdrawal ranges widely from 36 to 80%. The Pituitary Society recommends withdrawal of cabergoline in selected patients.
Our aim was to evaluate recurrence of hyperprolactinemia in patients meeting The Pituitary Society guidelines.
Patients were followed from the date of discontinuation to either relapse of hyperprolactinemia or the day of last prolactin test.
We conducted the study at an academic medical center.
Forty-six patients meeting Pituitary Society criteria (normoprolactinemic and with tumor volume reduction after 2 or more years of treatment) participated in the study.
After withdrawal, if prolactin returned above reference range, another measurement was obtained within 1 month, symptoms were assessed by questionnaire, and magnetic resonance imaging was performed.
We measured risk of and time to recurrence estimates as well as clinical predictors of recurrence.
Mean age of patients was 50 +/- 13 yr, and 70% were women. Thirty-one patients had microprolactinomas, 11 had macroprolactinomas, and four had nontumoral hyperprolactinemia. The overall recurrence was 54%, and the estimated risk of recurrence by 18 months was 63%. The median time to recurrence was 3 months (range, 1-18 months), with 91% of recurrences occurring within 1 yr after discontinuation. Size of tumor remnant prior to withdrawal predicted recurrence [18% increase in risk for each millimeter (95% confidence interval, 3-35; P = 0.017)]. None of the tumors enlarged in the patients experiencing recurrence, and 28% had symptoms of hypogonadism.
Cabergoline withdrawal is practical and safe in a subset of patients as defined by The Pituitary Society guidelines; however, the average risk of long-term recurrence in our study was over 60%. Close follow-up remains important, especially within the first year.
Angiotensin II has pro-fibrotic function in the liver. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) attenuates hepatic fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to determine the mechanism of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) on the progression of rat hepatic fibrosis.
Forty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups. Model group (Mo): The rats were injected subcutaneously with 40% of CCl(4) 0.25 mL/100 g. Perindopril group (Pe): The rats were injected subcutaneously with 40% of CCl(4). Perindopril, equivalent to 2 mg/(kg.d), was administrated. Control group (Nc): the rats were treated with olive oil only. After 4 and 6 wk, the rats were killed. The liver sections were stained with Masson. The protein expressions of AT1R, TGF-beta1 and PDGF-BB were examined by Western blot. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA binding activity was examined by EMSA (Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay). Matrix metalloproteinase-2,9 (MMP-2,9) activity was assessed by zymography. Serum laminin (LN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were measured using radioimmunoassays.
Using Western blot, we clearly provided direct evidence for the expression of AT1R in liver. The expression was up-regulated when fibrogenesis occurred. Perindopril treatment significantly reduced mean fibrosis score, protein levels of AT1R, TGF-beta1 and PDGF-BB, serum levels of HA and LN, and the activity of MMP-2,9. NF-kappaB DNA binding activity markedly increased in model group, perindopril treatment considerably reduced NF-kappaB DNA binding activity.
Perindopril attenuates CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis of rat by inhibiting TGF-beta1, PDGF-BB, NF-kappaB and MMP-2,9.
To study the effect of IL-10 on the expression of growth factors--transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) of hepatic fibrosis rat and the anti-fibrogenic role of exogenous IL-10.
Hepatic fibrosis was induced by CCl(4) administration intra-peritoneally. Sixty clean male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: normal control group (GN, 8 rats), hepatic fibrosis model group (GC, 28 rats) and IL-10 treated group (GI, 24 rats). At the beginning of the 7th and 11th wk, rats in each group were routinely perfused with pronase E and type IV collagenase through a portal vein catheter and the suspension obtained from the liver was spun by centrifugation with 11% Nycodenz density gradient to isolate HSCs. Histological examination was used to determine the degree of hepatic fibrosis. RT-PCR was employed to analyze mRNA expression from freshly isolated cells. Immunocytochemistry was performed to detect protein expression in primary cultured HSCs.
Rat hepatic fibrosis was developed with the increase of injection frequency of CCl(4), and HSCs were successfully isolated. At the 7th and 11th wk, TGF-beta1, EGF, and HGF mRNA in GC increased obviously compared with GN (P = 0.001/0.042, 0.001/0.001, 0.001/0.001) and GI (P = 0.001/0.007, 0.002/0.001, 0.001/0.001). For TGF-beta1, no difference was observed between GI and GN. For EGF, mRNA level in GI increased compared with GN during the 7th wk (P = 0.005) and 11th wk (P = 0.049). For HGF, mRNA level in GI decreased compared with GN at the 7th wk (P = 0.001) and 11th wk (P = 0.021). Between these two time points, TGF-beta1 expression at the 7th wk was higher than that of the 11th wk (P = 0.049), but for EGF, the former was lower than the latter (P = 0.022). As for PDGF mRNA, there was no significant difference between these groups, but difference seemed to exist in protein levels. Results by immunocytochemistry of TGF-beta1 and EGF were paralleled with the above findings.
The expression of TGF-beta1, EGF and HGF increased in HSC of hepatic fibrosis rat and decreased after treatment with IL-10. IL-10 plays an anti-fibrogenic role by suppressing growth factors expression.
We examined the ultrastructure of hearts from dogs given reserpine intramuscularly for 4 days, and from untreated dogs. Sections of the myocardium from treated dogs invariably revealed mitochondrial abnormalities at the 5th and 14th days. These included fragmentation and loss of structure of the cristae, and cyst formation. The appearance at 25 days in the treated as well as in all the untreated dogs was normal. We concluded that reserpine in the dose used produces marked structural changes in the mitochondria of heart muscle, and that these changes are reversible. These changes may account for the myocardial depression sometimes seen after administration of reserpine.
Indinavir is a protease inhibitor used for treating HIV-1. The drug is lithogenic and was thought to cause a 3% incidence of kidney stones. We evaluated a cohort of patients positive for HIV on indinavir to determine the incidence of indinavir nephrolithiasis and identify risk factors for indinavir stone formation.
Our cohort study of the prevalence of indinavir nephrolithiasis included 155 patients with HIV for 5,732 patient-weeks. The same cohort was then used for a retrospective chart review to assess patient age, weight, duration of drug use, time to stone formation, CD4 count, creatinine, alanine transaminase, and urinary pH and specific gravity as risk factors for stone formation.
We estimated the cumulative incidence of indinavir stone formation by the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator method. At 78 weeks 43.2% of patients had stones (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.292 to 0.543). Increasing age was the only variable that was a statistically significant predictor of indinavair urolithiasis (relative risk 0.955, 95% CI 0.918 to 0.993, p = 0.0159). The mean duration plus or minus standard deviation of indinavir use was statistically the same in each group (42.5 +/- 27. 2 and 40.3 +/- 27.1 weeks in those without and with stones, respectively) despite the observed mean time to stone formation of 23.0 +/- 19.8 weeks.
The clinical prevalence of indinavir nephrolithiasis is much greater than initially reported. Nephrolithiasis during indinavir use does not appear to induce patients to withdraw from the drug.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have shown promise in treating various forms of cancer. However, many HDAC inhibitors from diverse structural classes have been associated with QT prolongation in humans. Inhibition of the human ether a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel has been associated with QT prolongation and fatal arrhythmias. To determine if the observed cardiac effects of HDAC inhibitors in humans is due to hERG blockade, a highly potent HDAC inhibitor devoid of hERG activity was required. Starting with dacinostat (LAQ824), a highly potent HDAC inhibitor, we explored the SAR to determine the pharmacophores required for HDAC and hERG inhibition. We disclose here the results of these efforts where a high degree of pharmacophore homology between these two targets was discovered. This similarity prevented traditional strategies for mitigating hERG binding/modulation from being successful and novel approaches for reducing hERG inhibition were required. Using a hERG homology model, two compounds, 11r and 25i, were discovered to be highly efficacious with weak affinity for the hERG and other ion channels.
Following the observation that maternal ingestion of diethylstilbestrol was associated with the development of adenocarcinoma of the vagina in young women, analysis of 170 cases of the disease, collected over a two-year period, was undertaken. Details of history of non-steroidal estrogenic intake during pregnancy, its dosage and duration of intake and prevalence of concomitant abnormalities of the vagina and cervix were recorded. This analysis disclosed that dosage and duration of intake do not appear to be vital factors in contributing to the development of carcinoma. A controlled, prospective investigation of prenatal exposure to stilbestrol was also carried out. Vaginal and cervical abnormalities were common among 110 young women exposed to stilbestrol in utero. Biopsy-proved vaginal adenosis was present in 35% of the exposed population as compared with only 1% of the control subjects. Fibrous ridges of the vagina and cervix and failure of the vaginal mucosa and portions of the cervix to stain with iodine were also more frequently observed in the exposed population. While the risk of developing adenocarcinoma appears to be very low, a majority of exposed females do have other abnormalities of the lower genital tract. While some investigators believe that adenosis is a premalignant lesion, at present there is no clear-cut evidence of transition from adenosis to adenocarcinoma.
A decrease in the mitochondrial (mt) DNA to nuclear DNA ratio has gained acceptance as a marker of mitochondrial toxicity in treated HIV-infected patients, but the functional meaning of this alteration is unclear.
We assessed mtDNA content, mitochondrial content and function in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of consecutive asymptomatic HIV-infected patients. Patients selected had been receiving a first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen for at least 6 months, consisting of zidovudine plus lamivudine or stavudine plus didanosine plus either nelfinavir or nevirapine, or were antiretroviral-naive. The mtDNA content was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, mitochondrial content by citrate synthase activity, enzyme activity of complexes III and IV (both partially encoded by mtDNA) of the electron transport chain by spectrophotometry, oxygen consumption by polarography, and oxidative damage in cell membranes by monitoring cis-parinaric acid fluorescence.
Mitochondrial content was significantly lower in all treated groups. Patients receiving stavudine plus didanosine had mtDNA depletion and a decrease in complex IV activity. However, oxygen consumption capacity and lipid peroxidation were unaffected in all groups.
Long-term HAART may induce mitochondrial abnormalities in PBMC mitochondria, which do not necessarily translate into functional abnormalities, at least in asymptomatic patients.
The phosphosulfomannan 1 (PI-88) is a mixture of highly sulfated oligosaccharides that is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in cancer patients. As well as its anticancer properties, 1 displays a number of other interesting biological activities. A series of analogues of 1 were synthesized with a single carbon (pentasaccharide) backbone to facilitate structural characterization and interpretation of biological results. In a fashion similar to 1, all compounds were able to inhibit heparanase and to bind tightly to the proangiogenic growth factors FGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF. The compounds also inhibited the infection of cells and cell-to-cell spread of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). Preliminary pharmacokinetic data indicated that the compounds displayed different pharmacokinetic behavior compared with 1. Of particular note was the n-octyl derivative, which was cleared 3 times less rapidly than 1 and may provide increased systemic exposure.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to a family of the neurotrophin, which plays important roles in the neurodevelopment of dopaminergic-related systems and interacts with meso-limbic dopaminergic systems involved in the therapeutic response to antipsychotics. Functional experiments have suggested that BDNF may be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia.
In this study, we genotyped two important functional polymorphisms in the BDNF gene using a sample of Han Chinese patients consisting of 340 schizophrenic patients and 343 healthy controls. We found a statistical difference in the 232-bp allele distribution of the BDNF gene (GT)n dinucleotide repeat polymorphism between the schizophrenic patients and controls. In early onset patients, the 234-bp allele had a risk role. For the chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome, the 230-bp allele and the 234-bp allele acted in opposite directions, that is, patients with the 230-bp allele of the (GT)n polymorphism exhibited a lower degree of induced extrapyramidal syndrome. Haplotype-based analysis also revealed a very important risk haplotype (P=0.0000226546).
These findings suggest that BDNF plays an important role in the susceptibility to schizophrenia and that the (GT)n repeat polymorphism of the BDNF gene may be an independent contributor to the chlorpromazine treatment-sensitive form of schizophrenia.
The no-reflow phenomenon is often found in venous grafts and every effort to prevent it is worthwhile. We performed an angioplasty on a venous graft in a patient with a NSTE acute coronary syndrome with previous inferior myocardial infarction (1996) and CABG (3 venous grafts ), respectively. The native coronary vessels had significant lesions: 70% left main stenosis, distal circumflex artery occlusion, LAD occlusion after the first diagonal branch and proximal occlusion of the RCA. All of the venous grafts,with the exception of the circumflex, were patent. The latter showed subocclusion and slow flow. This was the culprit lesion for the unstable syndrome. After stenting it, no residual stenosis appeared, but severe no-reflow ensued. The no-reflow phenomenon disappeared after intracoronary eptifibatide infusion and aspiration of the slugging contrast from the vein. Clinically, the patient had no chest pain and his ECG changes normalized.
We have previously reported that incubation of isolated rat hepatocytes with the antimicrobial drug nitrofurantoin causes toxic oxidative stress as a result of oxygen activation by futile one-electron redox cycling. In continuation of this work nitrofurantoin was found to cause rapid glutathione-protein mixed disulfide formation before GSSG had completely effluxed from the hepatocytes. Furthermore, the disulfide reductant dithiothreitol added up to 60 min later restored protein thiols and prevented cytotoxicity. In contrast, under hypoxic conditions nitrofurantoin-induced hepatocyte toxicity was associated with [14C]nitrofurantoin irreversible binding to protein, protein thiol depletion without glutathione-protein mixed disulfide formation, and GSH depletion. Furthermore, dithiothreitol did not have any antidotal properties and did not reverse covalent binding though some binding was prevented. These results suggest that under aerobic conditions nitrofurantoin-induced hepatocyte toxicity is due to the formation of glutathione-protein mixed disulfides, while under hypoxic conditions toxicity is associated with protein alkylation.
The discovery of two histamine H(3) antagonist clinical candidates is disclosed. The pathway to identification of the two clinical candidates, 6 (PF-03654746) and 7 (PF-03654764) required five hypothesis driven design cycles. The key to success in identifying these clinical candidates was the development of a compound design strategy that leveraged medicinal chemistry knowledge and traditional assays in conjunction with computational and in vitro safety tools. Overall, clinical compounds 6 and 7 exceeded conservative safety margins and possessed optimal pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles, thus achieving our initial goal of identifying compounds with fully aligned oral drug attributes, "best-in-class" molecules.
Apoptotic cell death induced by cross-linking Fas receptor (FasR/CD95) has been investigated in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. FasR-mediated growth inhibition and DNA fragmentation could be induced in certain cases of AML. Interestingly, when DNA synthesis and G1 -> S transition in the cell cycle were enhanced by interleukin-3 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Fas-insensitive blast cells acquired cellular susceptibility toward FasR-mediated growth inhibition. To further evaluate an association between the Fas-R-mediated action and a specific phase of the cell cycle, a FasR+ leukemic cell line, MML-1, was established from a patient with AML. The morphologic feature of dying cells and DNA fragmentation indicated that FasR cross-linking induced apoptotic cell death in MML-1 cells. Cell cycle arrest in G1A phase with the treatment of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or thymidine rendered MML-1 cells resistant to FasR-mediated apoptosis without downregulation of surface FasR expression. However, S-phase arrest with 5-fluorouracil could neither enhance nor inhibit FasR-mediated apoptosis. Simultaneous DNA/RNA quantification analysis revealed the selective loss of cells in G1B compartment, accompanied by the increase of apoptotic nuclei in sub-G1 fraction. These findings suggested that FasR-mediated apoptotic signals could be transduced into cells in G1B compartment and G1A -> G1B transition might augment the induction of FasR-mediated apoptosis.
There has been concern that the use of isotretinoin to treat acne may lead to depression. To date, research has not conclusively determined if this concern is warranted when contemplating the use of isotretinoin.
This study investigated the impact of isotretinoin use for patients with acne on mood status. The hypothesis was that an association exists between the use of isotretinoin and the development of depression, aside from acne severity.
We studied the relationship between isotretinoin and depression using a prospective, controlled, cohort design. The study was conducted in a community dermatology clinic. The exposed cohort consisted of consenting patients who were initiating isotretinoin treatment for acne. Patients were either treated with isotretinoin (Acutaneï) therapy (study group) (N=100) or by oral (N=41) or topical acne therapy (control group) (N=59). The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale and the Zung Depression Status Inventory were used to assess depression both at baseline and after 2 months of prescribed use of isotretinoin or a control medication (topical or oral antibiotics).
There was no correlation between isotretinoin use and the development of depression, based on either the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (Fisherâs exact test, P=0.497) or Zung Depression Status Inventory (ANOVA; F=1.4, P=0.2).
Isotretinoin does not appear to be associated with the development of depression. Thus, denying patients with significant acne an effective medication for fear of developing depression may not be indicated at this point in time.
We report a case of life-threatening intoxication and a controlled re-exposure study to dextromethorphan. A 60-year-old man developed postsurgical neuropathic cervical pain treated by hydromorphone, gabapentin, clonazepam, and amitriptyline. He received a dextromethorphan preparation for a catarrhal syndrome. Two days later, he was admitted into an emergency department in a profound coma. Thirty-six hours later, after withdrawal of all drugs, the situation normalized. A genotyping for UDP-glucuronyltransferase 1A1 and CYP2D6 was followed by a re-exposure study. During the three days, vital parameters and side effects of drugs were prospectively recorded. The second day, dextromethorphan was introduced. No significant impairment in parameters nor influence on analgesic efficacy were noted. Dextromethorphan concentrations suggested an accumulation without reaching any steady state. Somnolence was noted for plasma concentrations around 100ng/mL. The CYP2D6*4 variant leading to a poor metabolizer phenotype was found. Moreover, this phenotype was potentially aggravated by amitriptyline intake. This study allowed the identification and the confirmation of the cause of the coma. In conclusion, it is probably wise to recommend avoiding dextromethorphan in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants or another inhibitor of CYP2D6. Drug-drug interactions are probably underdiagnosed and underreported, and drugs considered as safe may induce serious complications.
Fatty acids of marine origin, i.e. docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) act as hypolipidaemics, but they do not improve glycaemic control in obese and diabetic patients. Thiazolidinediones like rosiglitazone are specific activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which improve whole-body insulin sensitivity. We hypothesised that a combined treatment with a DHA and EPA concentrate (DHA/EPA) and rosiglitazone would correct, by complementary additive mechanisms, impairments of lipid and glucose homeostasis in obesity.
Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a corn oil-based high-fat diet. The effects of DHA/EPA (replacing 15% dietary lipids), rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg diet) or a combination of both on body weight, adiposity, metabolic markers and adiponectin in plasma, as well as on liver and muscle gene expression and metabolism were analysed. Euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps were used to characterise the changes in insulin sensitivity. The effects of the treatments were also analysed in dietary obese mice with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).
DHA/EPA and rosiglitazone exerted additive effects in prevention of obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy, low-grade adipose tissue inflammation, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance, while inducing adiponectin, suppressing hepatic lipogenesis and decreasing muscle ceramide concentration. The improvement in glucose tolerance reflected a synergistic stimulatory effect of the combined treatment on muscle glycogen synthesis and its sensitivity to insulin. The combination treatment also reversed dietary obesity, dyslipidaemia and IGT.
DHA/EPA and rosiglitazone can be used as complementary therapies to counteract dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance. The combination treatment may reduce dose requirements and hence the incidence of adverse side effects of thiazolidinedione therapy.
The authors measured the presence and extent of asymptomatic microbleeds on gradient-recalled-echo MRI in 21 aspirin users who developed intracerebral hemorrhage and 21 aspirin users without history of intracerebral hemorrhage. Microbleeds were more frequent (19 vs 7, p < 0.001) and more extensive (mean number of microbleeds 13.3 vs 0.4, p < 0.001) in the intracerebral hemorrhage group than in the control group. Asymptomatic microbleeds may be a risk factor for aspirin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage.
