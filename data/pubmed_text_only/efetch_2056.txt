Patients and models of temporal lobe epilepsy have fewer inhibitory interneurons in the dentate gyrus than controls, but it is unclear whether granule cell inhibition is reduced. We report the loss of GABAergic inhibition of granule cells in the temporal dentate gyrus of pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats. In situ hybridization for GAD65 mRNA and immunocytochemistry for parvalbumin and somatostatin confirmed the loss of inhibitory interneurons. In epileptic rats, granule cells had prolonged EPSPs, and they discharged more action potentials than controls. Although the conductances of evoked IPSPs recorded in normal ACSF were not significantly reduced and paired-pulse responses showed enhanced inhibition of granule cells from epileptic rats, more direct measures of granule cell inhibition revealed significant deficiencies. In granule cells from epileptic rats, evoked monosynaptic IPSP conductances were <40% of controls, and the frequency of GABA(A) receptor-mediated spontaneous and miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) was <50% of controls. Within 3-7 d after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, miniature IPSC frequency had decreased, and it remained low, without functional evidence of compensatory synaptogenesis by GABAergic axons in chronically epileptic rats. Both parvalbumin- and somatostatin-immunoreactive interneuron numbers and the frequency of both fast- and slow-rising GABA(A) receptor-mediated mIPSCs were reduced, suggesting that loss of inhibitory synaptic input to granule cells occurred at both proximal/somatic and distal/dendritic sites. Reduced granule cell inhibition in the temporal dentate gyrus preceded the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures by days to weeks, so it may contribute, but is insufficient, to cause epilepsy.
Cardiac fibrosis is a common pathological process presented in a variety of diseases, including hypertension and diabetes. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) have been identified as the most important participants in the development of cardiac fibrosis. Exposure of cultured CFs to high glucose (HG) or angiotensin II (Ang II) resulted in increased collagen synthesis. Resveratrol (Res) is a natural polyphenol exhibiting anti-fibrosis effects in a number of different organs fibrosis process, whether Res can prevent HG and Ang II induced fibrosis response in CFs remains unclear. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of Res in HG and Ang II induced fibrosis response in CFs. We cultured rat CFs in either normal glucose (5.6 mM) or HG (25 mM) media in the presence of Res or not and the changes in collagens synthesis and TGF-β1 production were assessed by Real-time PCR, Western blotting, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, normal and diabetic mice (induced by single dose of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg) via tail vein) receiving Res (10 mg/kg) were used to explore the effects of Res on cardiac fibrosis in vivo. Masson staining and immunohistochemistry were performed to visualize cardiac collagen deposition. Results indicate that CFs exposed to HG condition shows enhanced proliferation rate. Furthermore, in the presence of HG or Ang II, CFs exhibited increased collagens synthesis and TGF-β1 production. And these effects were abolished by Res intervention. In vivo results show that diabetic mice exhibit increased collagen deposition in the cardiac compared with the normal mice. And this change was prevented by the treatment of Res. These results suggest that Res possesses a potential antifibrogenic effect in hypertension and diabetes-related cardiac fibrosis. Moreover, the action mechanism is probably associated with its ability to reduce TGF-β1 content in CFs.
The most important limitation in primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the small number of catheterization laboratories and their non-homogeneous territorial distribution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an organizational model based on a network including tertiary referral centers and community hospitals for the treatment of AMI with alteplase plus abciximab followed by PCI.
From October to November 2002, 232 patients < or = 75 years with AMI at high risk (84 transferred from four community hospitals and 148 patients admitted directly at the tertiary center) underwent PCI at our Institution. We compared procedural results and clinical outcome in patients with AMI undergoing PCI with or without transfer to tertiary centers.
Patient transferal from community hospitals determines a greater door-to-balloon time (120 vs 55 min, p < 0.001), while complications observed during transportation are limited (5.9%). Transferred patients have a greater percentage of infarct-related artery patency (77 vs 22%, p < 0.001) and of ST-segment resolution 90 min post-PCI (77 vs 57%, p < 0.005) in comparison with direct-access patients. The incidence of clinical events (death, reinfarction, angina) was not different between the two groups at 30 days and at 6 months of follow-up.
In our experience the integrated model between tertiary centers and community hospitals represents a valid network system offering homogeneous therapeutic (alternatives) options to all patients with AMI regardless of the hospital where they are first admitted.
The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) elicits robust anorectic and emetic effects in several animal species. However, less is known about the potential for naturally occurring and synthetic congeners of this trichothecene to cause analogous responses. Here we tested the hypothesis that alterations in DON structure found in the plant metabolite deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (D3G) and two pharmacologically active synthetic DON derivatives, EN139528 and EN139544, differentially impact their potential to evoke food refusal and emesis. In a nocturnal mouse food consumption model, oral administration with DON, D3G, EN139528, or EN139544 at doses from 2.5 to 10 mg/kg BW induced anorectic responses that lasted up to 16, 6, 6, and 3 h, respectively. Anorectic potency rank orders were EN139544>DON>EN139528>D3G from 0 to 0.5 h but DON>D3G>EN139528>EN139544 from 0 to 3 h. Oral exposure to each of the four compounds at a common dose (2.5 mg/kg BW) stimulated plasma elevations of the gut satiety peptides cholecystokinin and to a lesser extent, peptide YY3-36 that corresponded to reduced food consumption. In a mink emesis model, oral administration of increasing doses of the congeners differentially induced emesis, causing marked decreases in latency to emesis with corresponding increases in both the duration and number of emetic events. The minimum emetic doses for DON, EN139528, D3G, and EN139544 were 0.05, 0.5, 2, and 5 mg/kg BW, respectively. Taken together, the results suggest that although all three DON congeners elicited anorectic responses that mimicked DON over a narrow dose range, they were markedly less potent than the parent mycotoxin at inducing emesis.
A 58-year-old normotensive male with normal renal function and gastric cancer underwent total gastrectomy and received adjuvant chemotherapy with mitomycin C (MMC) for 10 months. He developed anemia, hypertension, and renal function impairment 9 months after initiation of chemotherapy. Kidney biopsy showed thrombotic microangiopathy with marked mesangiolysis and expansion of the subendothelial space resulting in cystic dilation of the glomerular capillaries, and cellular atypia in the tubular cells. His renal function deteriorated gradually then stabilized after treatment with plasma exchange, antihypertensive agents, and antiplatelet agents. He had no sign of tumor recurrence after 3 years of follow-up. We suggest that patients receiving MMC should have their blood pressure and renal function closely monitored for the possibility of development of drug-induced renal insufficiency.
The increased locomotor activity induced by systemic injections of d-amphetamine or scopolamine in rats was studied in Digiscan Animal Activity Monitors. This multifactorial analysis of locomotion demonstrated that activity measures of horizontal (ambulatory), vertical (rearing), stereotypic, and rotational behaviors differed depending on dose and drug. The topographies of these activity variables may be unique for the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems underlying hyperactivity. These results are a first step toward a needed increase in the sophistication of behavioral pharmacological techniques, allowing for the development of specific activity prints for different classes of psychoactive agents.
Both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivates are used for the treatment of dyslipidemia in Type 2 diabetes patients. The aim of this study was to compare the lipid lowering effect of 40 mg pravastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, and 400 mg bezafibrate, a fibric acid derivate, on serum lipids, lipoproteins and lipoprotein composition in 45 (22 men and 23 women) dyslipidemic, insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes patients.
The study used a double-blind, cross-over design.
Pravastatin treatment was more effective in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, LDL-triglycerides, LDL-ApoB and LDL/HDL-cholesterol ratio (all p<0.001 between groups) and total/HDL-cholesterol and ApoA1/LDL-ApoB ratios (both p<0.01) and always induced a decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentrations and LDL/HDL-cholesterol ratio irrespective of baseline triglyceride concentration. Bezafibrate was more effective in increasing HDL-cholesterol (p<0.01 between groups), ApoA1 lipoprotein and decreasing triglycerides (both p<0.001 between groups) but induced an increase in LDL-cholesterol concentration particularly in patients with baseline triglyceride concentrations exceeding 2.0 mmol/l. With bezafibrate treatment the LDL-cholesterol/LDL-ApoB ratio showed a tendency to rise, suggesting a change in the LDL particle composition to a less small and dense form, while pravastatin treatment induced a decrease in this ratio suggesting a change in the LDL particle to a more dense form. With pravastatin treatment a small rise in HbA(1c) was observed.
Pravastatin treatment is superior in lowering cholesterol-enriched lipoprotein subpopulations and improving cardiovascular risk factors. Bezafibrate is more effective in raising HDL-cholesterol and alters LDL particle composition to a more favorable form.
We have reported the case of a 58-year-old woman with cerebral palsy who experienced a persistent, generalized syndrome of dystonia and rigidity (tardive dystonia-parkinsonism) while being treated for vomiting with metoclopramide in combination with prochlorperazine. This syndrome was more severe than is typically seen in drug-induced extrapyramidal syndromes and may have contributed to her death. The extreme severity of this disorder was probably related to the use of a combination of dopamine antagonists in a patient who had premorbid cerebral dysfunction. Although dopamine antagonists should always be used with caution in individuals with cerebral dysfunction, this particular combination of antiemetics should probably be avoided in such patients.
This study determined whether genetic variability in exons 3 and 4 of the microsomal epoxide hydrolase gene jointly modifies individual preeclampsia risk. The study also determined whether genetic variability in the gene encoding for microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX) contributes to individual differences in susceptibility to the development of preeclampsia. The study involved 133 preeclamptic and 115 healthy control pregnant women who were genotyped for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), T-->C (Tyr113His) in exon 3 and A-->G (His139Arg) in exon 4, in the EPHX gene. Chi-square analysis was used to assess genotype and allele frequency differences between the preeclamptic and control groups. In addition, single-point analysis was expanded to pair of loci haplotype analysis to examine the estimated haplotype frequencies of the two SNPs, of unknown phase, among the preeclamptic and control groups. Estimated haplotype frequencies were assessed using the maximum-likelihood method, employing an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Single-point allele and genotype distributions in exons 3 and 4 of the EPHX gene were not statistically different between the groups. However, according to the haplotype estimation analysis, we observed a significantly elevated frequency of haplotype T-A (Tyr113-His139) among the preeclampsia group vs the control group (P=0.01). The odds ratio for preeclampsia associated with the high-activity haplotype T-A (Tyr113-His139) was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.12-2.32). The use of two intragenic SNPs jointly in haplotype analysis of association demonstrated that the genetically determined high-activity haplotype T-A (Tyr113-His139) was significantly associated with preeclampsia.
Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are synthetic chemicals that arise from sources such as pesticides and have the ability to mimic or inhibit gonadal steroid hormones. The objective of this research was to examine the effects of EDCs on the behaviors associated with monogamy and the expression of related neuropeptide receptors. Pine voles, a novel experimental mammal, were chosen because they display strong monogamous pair bonding. Female pine voles were orally administered estrogenic diethylstilbestrol (DES) and methoxychlor (MXC) or oil control throughout gestation and lactation of pups. Exposed pups were tested as adults. Preference for the mate and maternal behaviors were assessed. While the ability to form partner preferences was intact, DES-exposed females showed increased aggression toward a stranger, while MXC exposed females showed a strong trend toward spending more time alone. Oxytocin (OT) receptor binding in the brain was assessed for possible effects on this behaviorally important neuropeptide signaling system. The cingulate cortex showed a reduction in OT binding in the MXC group. These findings demonstrate that exposure to EDCs during pre- and neonatal development can alter female adult neural phenotype and behavior related to monogamous behavior traits.
Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid agonist that can be used as an alternative to morphine in controlling cancer pain. It differs from morphine in its biphasic qualities in controlled release (CR) formulation. This review of post-1995 international literature explores the use of oxycodone compared with morphine, as well as titration studies comparing CR formulation against the conventional immediate release (IR) formulation. Most studies involved small numbers and so their results cannot be generalized. Statistical tests were used inappropriately in several of the studies reviewed, which compromises the validity of the findings, but it is important to note that there was broad agreement between researchers. Studies were graded based on research quality criteria of the US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (United States Department for Health and Human Services, 1993). Conversion ratios and side-effects are discussed and recommendations made for the use of oxycodone in opioid rotation, particularly for patients suffering morphine-induced hallucinations. Several studies also recommend the use of oxycodone in preference to morphine in patients with renal impairment.
Coumarin derivatives, including warfarin, acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon, are the drugs of choice for long-term treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. The management of oral anticoagulation is challenging because of a large variability in the dose-response relationship, which is in part caused by genetic polymorphisms. The narrow therapeutic range may result in bleeding complications or recurrent thrombosis, especially during the initial phase of treatment. The aim of this review is to systematically extract the published data reporting pharmacogenetic influences on oral anticoagulant therapy and to provide empirical doses for individual genotype combinations. To this end, we extracted all data from clinical studies of warfarin, phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol that reported genetic influences on either the dose demand or adverse drug effects, such as bleeding complications. Data were summarized for each substance, and the relative effect of each relevant gene was calculated across studies, assuming a linear gene-dose effect in Caucasians. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, which is the main enzyme for rate-limiting metabolism of oral anticoagulants, had the largest impact on the dose demand. Compared with homozygous carriers of CYP2C9*1, patients homozygous for CYP2C9*3 were estimated to need 3.3-fold lower mean doses of warfarin to achieve the same international normalized ratio, with *2 carriers and heterozygous patients in between. Differences for acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon were 2.5-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. Homozygosity of the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) variant C1173T (*2) allele (VKORC1 is the molecular target of anticoagulant action) was related to 2.4-fold, 1.6-fold and 1.9-fold lower dose requirements compared with the wild-type for warfarin, acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon, respectively. Compared with CYP2C9 and VKORC1 homozygous wild-type individuals, patients with polymorphisms in these genes also more often experience severe overanticoagulation. An empirical dose table, which may be useful as a basis for dose individualization, is presented for the combined CYP2C9/VKORC1 genotypes. Genetic polymorphism in further enzymes and structures involved in the effect of anticoagulants such as gamma-glutamylcarboxylase, glutathione S-transferase A1, microsomal epoxide hydrolase and apolipoprotein E appear to be of negligible importance.Despite the clear effects of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants, these polymorphisms explain less than half of the interindividual variability in the dose response to oral anticoagulants. Thus, while individuals at the extremes of the dose requirements are likely to benefit, the overall clinical merits of a genotype-adapted anticoagulant treatment regimen in the entire patient populations remain to be determined in further prospective clinical studies.
To assess the effects of caffeine on selected manual manipulation skills 16 college-age (21 +/- 1.7 yr.) caffeine-naive women (less than 90 mg/day), having avoided products containing caffeine for four days, reported for testing eight hours postprandial. Measurements included duration and frequency of error for hand steadiness, duration and frequency error for following a tracing pattern, and duration of completing a tweezer-pin placement dexterity test. Caffeine doses of either 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg body weight or a placebo (200 mg. methylcellulose) were administered randomly to all subjects on three separate occasions using a double-blind format. A 2 x 3 repeated-measures analysis of variance and a Newman-Keuls post hoc test yielded a significant difference in hand steadiness error time from pre- to posttest for 5 mg/kg but not for 2.5 mg/kg or the placebo trial. For frequency of hand steadiness error, significant changes occurred for both 5.0 and 2.5 mg/kg. A dose of 5.0 mg/kg group resulted in significant differences in both tracing error time and error frequency. As both doses of caffeine significantly increased dexterity time, it was concluded that caffeine has detrimental effects on selected performance skills of young caffeine-naive women.
Peripheral blood CD3+, CD19+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD45RO+ mononuclear cell subsets, T-cell proliferative responses to combinations of coimmobilized OKT3 antibody and an ECM protein (collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin or elastin), and T-cell adhesion to collagen IV, fibronectin and elastin were studied in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. No significant difference was found in the major lymphocyte subsets between subarachnoid haemorrhage patients receiving no dexamethasone for brain oedema treatment and healthy blood donors. Compared with the latter, both the dexamethasone-untreated and -treated subarachnoid haemorrhage patients showed decreased relative proliferative responses of circulating T cells to OKT3 combinations with collagen IV and fibronectin, and an increased PHA-activated T-cell adhesion to elastin. CD45RO+, CD4+ and CD19+ peripheral blood cell subsets, CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio, PHA-activated T-cell adhesion to fibronectin and collagen IV, and OKT3-triggered T-cell costimulatory responses to elastin, collagen IV and fibronectin were significantly higher in subarachnoid haemorrhage patients presenting with delayed cerebral vasospasm (DCV) than in their DCV-free counterparts. The DCV-related differences in circulating lymphocyte subsets showed no apparent relationship to the glucocorticoid treatment, whereas the differences in the other indices were confined to the dexamethasone-untreated subarachnoid haemorrhage patients. The above results suggest that the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and T cell-ECM interactions play a role in the emergence of subarachnoid haemorrhage/DCV and may represent potential targets for subarachnoid haemorrhage therapy.
The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of lamivudine in hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBs Ag) positive patients with rheumatologic disease. From June 2004 to October 2006, 11 HBs Ag positive patients with rheumatologic diseases, who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic lamivudine therapies, were retrospectively assessed. Liver function tests, hepatitis B virus (HBV) serologic markers, and HBV DNA levels of the patients during follow-up were obtained from hospital file records. Eleven patients (six male) with median age 47 years (range 27-73), median disease duration 50 months (range 9-178) and median follow-up period of patients 13.8 months (range 5-27) were enrolled in this study. Lamivudine therapy was started 3-7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients. Baseline, liver function tests were elevated in two patients (fourth patient: ALT:122 IU/l, AST:111 IU/l, tenth patient:ALT:294 IU/l, AST:274 IU/l, with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both). Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow-up period none of the patients had abnormal liver function tests. In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline. Two of these normalized and the others increased later. In three additional patients, HBV DNA levels were increased during follow-up. None of the patients had significant clinical sings of HBV activation. Lamivudine was well tolerated and was continued in all patients. Prophylactic administration of lamivudine in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe, well tolerated and effective in preventing HBV reactivation.
Artemisinin (a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide) has become important in multi-drug treatment of malaria. There is evidence that artemisinin induces drug metabolism which could result in drug-drug interactions. The objective of this study was to characterize the inductive properties of artemisinin on drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. The possibility of artemisinin to induce CYP450 was studied in artemisinin-treated (orally for four days) and vehicle-treated rats using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effect on enzymatic activities in mouse microsomes from multiple artemisinin administration (intraperitonally) to mice were also studied as well as the effect on the expression in mouse primary hepatocytes and HEK293 cells. Increased CYP2B1 mRNA levels in rats could be seen after artemisinin treatment as well as a weak but reproducible increase in the intensity of CYP1A2. Administration of artemisinin to mice up-regulated hepatic CYP2B10-dependent, and to a lesser extent, CYP2A5-dependent enzyme activities. In primary hepatocyte culture, artemisinin significantly increased the CYP2B10 mRNA levels whereas the CYP2A5 mRNA levels were increased to a lesser extent. No significant changes were seen in the levels of other CYP enzymes. Artemisinin was an activator of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) but not pregnane X receptor (PXR) in HEK293 cells. The results demonstrate that the drug exerts its effects on drug metabolism via the CAR receptor that results in up-regulation of genes such as the Cyp2b. The weaker up-regulation of CYP2A5 might also be CAR-dependent or alternatively, a consequence of artemisinin toxicity. The results of this study are of importance when predicting potential drug-drug interactions in multi-drug therapies with artemisinin.
To report a case of indinavir-induced urolithiasis, and the greater risk of this occurrence in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) who require fluid restriction for an intermittent catheterization program (ICP).
Case report.
A 38-year-old man with a T4 ASIA A SCI (according to the American Spinal Injury Association classification scale) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was using an ICP and taking indinavir (a protease inhibitor) as part of his antiviral regimen. Cystoscopy was performed to rule out recurrent urethral condylomata. He was found to have a bladder stone measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm x 0.3 cm, which, on analysis, was composed of indinavir (100% exterior, 90% interior). The bladder stone was removed under direct visualization. The plain abdominal radiograph did not reveal any stones.
Indinavir is a frequently used drug for the treatment of HIV that has the potential to induce urinary lithiasis. This is particularly problematic for individuals with SCI who are on fluid restriction and an ICP. Therefore, cystoscopy and monitoring for indinavir-induced urolithiasis should be undertaken in individuals with SCI who are taking indinavir. Considerations include switching to a different protease inhibitor or choosing an entirely new HIV drug cocktail with less potential for urolithiasis.
The effects of the acute injection of a rabbit anti-substance P serum (ASPS) were studied in normal rats and rats with hyperprolactinemia induced by 5-hydroxytryptophan and estradiol given as a short or chronic treatment. The anti-substance P serum decreased the release of prolactin induced by 5-hydroxytryptophan when this serotonin precursor was injected 24 h, but not 1 h, after the administration of the antiserum. ASPS reduced the hyperprolactinemia induced by short and chronic treatment with estradiol in castrated rats. This effect was observed 24 h after the injection of the antiserum. On the other hand, the injection of ASPS induced a significant decrease in LH levels in serum of intact male rats injected with 5-hydroxytryptophan 24 h after ASPS, and in castrated rats treated with short-term and chronic administration of estradiol, 24 h after the injection of the antiserum. These results suggest that substance P may have a role in the control of prolactin secretion and could play a part in the hyperprolactinemic effects of estradiol. On the other hand, substance P, under certain circumstances, may stimulate LH release.
Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is a member of the gp130 family of cytokines. We observed that ct-1(-/-) mice develop mature-onset obesity, insulin resistance, and hypercholesterolemia despite reduced calorie intake. Decreased energy expenditure preceded and accompanied the development of obesity. Acute treatment with rCT-1 decreased blood glucose in an insulin-independent manner and increased insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in muscle. These changes were associated with stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, an effect that was absent in AMPKα2(-/-) mice. Chronic rCT-1 treatment reduced food intake, enhanced energy expenditure, and induced white adipose tissue remodeling characterized by upregulation of genes implicated in the control of lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis and genes typifying brown fat phenotype. Moreover, rCT-1 reduced body weight and corrected insulin resistance in ob/ob and in high-fat-fed obese mice. We conclude that CT-1 is a master regulator of fat and glucose metabolism with potential applications for treatment of obesity and insulin resistance.
There is growing concern that some cytotoxic regimens for cancer affect cognitive functioning. This study examined the prevalence of cognitive complaints and deficits in testicular cancer (TC) patients treated with the worldwide standard BEP (bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin) chemotherapy.
Seventy TC patients treated with BEP chemotherapy after surgery (S + CT) were examined with interviews and neuropsychological tests. These patients were compared with 57 TC patients treated with radiotherapy after surgery (S + RT) and with 55 TC patients that received surgery only (S). Patients were examined a median of 3 years after completion of treatment.
Thirty two percent of the S + CT patients reported cognitive complaints compared with 32% of the S + RT patients and 27% of the S patients (p = 0.85). No differences in mean cognitive test performance were observed between the groups. On individual impairment scores, more S + CT patients showed cognitive dysfunction compared with S patients, but not compared with S + RT patients (S + CT versus S [p = 0.038, OR = 4.6, CI = 1.1-19.7], S + CT versus S + RT [p = 0.70, OR = 0.8, CI = 0.3-2.4] and S + RT versus S [p = 0.070, OR = 3.7, CI = 0.8-15.7). Cognitive complaints were not related to cognitive test performance, but to emotional distress and fatigue.
Cognitive complaints are common among TC patients, independent of treatment modality. These complaints are related to emotional distress and fatigue and not to formal cognitive deficits. The finding of a small group of TC patients treated with chemotherapy exhibiting cognitive deficits should be confirmed in a prospective study before we can decide on its cause and relevance.
Ceftriaxone is a widely used third-generation cephalosporin. In this prospective study, we used sonography to investigate the incidence and outcome of biliary complications in children receiving ceftriaxone therapy.
Ceftriaxone was administered intravenously at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day for 1-3 weeks to 118 children hospitalized for severe infection. Serial gallbladder sonograms were obtained on days 1, 5-7, and 10-14 of therapy and the day after therapy ended if it had lasted more than 2 weeks. When sonographic abnormalities were found, additional sonograms were obtained every 3 days until the abnormalities had completely resolved.
Twenty patients (17%), all asymptomatic, demonstrated sonographic abnormalities: 8 had gallbladder sludge, defined as echogenic material without associated acoustic shadowing, and 12 had pseudolithiasis, defined as echogenic material with acoustic shadowing. These abnormalities spontaneously resolved within 2 weeks of stopping the ceftriaxone (mean time to disappearance, 8.2 +/- 3.4 days). No significant differences were found between patients with normal versus abnormal sonographic findings in sex, age, duration of treatment, or other risk factors for drug precipitation.
Ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis is usually asymptomatic and was rapidly reversible after cessation of therapy in this group of Turkish children.
6-Mercaptopurine monohydrate was injected sc at 2 mg base/kg/day from 2 to 22 days of age to four litters of rat pups (four females, four males per litter). Control neonates were injected sc with basic saline (pH 8). Daily observations for signs of toxicity were made during the treatment period and once weekly thereafter until the rats were 6 months of age. The pups were weighed at 2, 12, 23, 34, 100, and 480 days of age. Fertility was tested at 3 to 6 months of age. From 6 months of age on, the rats were examined for tumors at 3-month intervals until the experiment was terminated at 16 months of age. A reduction in body weight of treated rats began between 34 and 100 days of age and became more pronounced by 16 months of age. Fertility was similar in treated and control groups and there were no detectable tumors in either group. The major finding in treated rats was a delayed onset of hind leg paresis that was first detected at 12 months of age. Light microscopic examination of tissues taken from the hind quarters of these rats at 16 months of age revealed a severe atrophic degeneration with fatty infiltration of sublumbar and thigh muscles.
The nephrotoxicity of ceftazidime compared with that of cefazolin or cephaloridine and the capacity of ceftazidime to enhance the nephrotoxicity of tobramycin were evaluated in rats. Only cephaloridine and tobramycin given alone altered creatinine clearance or caused significant histological injury. Our data suggest that ceftazidime is no more nephrotoxic than cefazolin and does not enhance the nephrotoxicity of tobramycin.
It has been suggested that autism, like other complex genetic disorders, may benefit from the study of rare or Mendelian variants associated with syndromic or non-syndromic forms of the disease. However, there are few examples in which common variation in genes causing a Mendelian neuropsychiatric disorder has been shown to contribute to disease susceptibility in an allied common condition. Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare recessively inherited disorder, with mutations reported at several loci including the gene Abelson's Helper Integration 1 (AHI1). A significant proportion of patients with JS, in some studies up to 40%, have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and several linkage studies in ASD have nominally implicated the region on 6q where AHI1 resides. To evaluate AHI1 in ASD, we performed a three-stage analysis of AHI1 as an a priori candidate gene for autism. Re-sequencing was first used to screen AHI1, followed by two subsequent association studies, one limited and one covering the gene more completely, in Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) families. In stage 3, we found evidence of an associated haplotype in AHI1 with ASD after correction for multiple comparisons, in a region of the gene that had been previously associated with schizophrenia. These data suggest a role for AHI1 in common disorders affecting human cognition and behavior.
In rodents, extended access to cocaine produces an escalation in cocaine self-administration that has face and construct validity for human compulsive drug intake. Here we report that rats with six-hour access (long access, LgA) to cocaine self-administration produced a higher breakpoint for cocaine using a progressive-ratio schedule than rats with one-hour access (short access, ShA), and prazosin (alpha 1 receptor antagonist) reduced the higher breakpoint for cocaine in LgA rats. Additionally, the number of neurons with alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-like immunoreactivity in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) was found to be much lower in LgA rats than in ShA and drug-naive rats. In contrast, UK14304 (alpha 2 receptor agonist) and betaxolol (beta 1 receptor antagonist) had no effect on cocaine self-administration in either group. The data suggest that activation of the alpha 1-noradrenergic system, perhaps in the BNST, is associated with increased motivation for cocaine in rats with extended access.
