Mammals produce two isozymes of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Somatic ACE plays an important role in the control of blood pressure. The function of testis ACE, produced by male and germ cells, is not known. To examine the roles of these isozymes, we used targeted homologous recombination to introduce a modified ACE allele into a mouse line. Mice homozygous for this mutant allele lack both ACE isozymes and have markedly reduced blood pressures. Contrary to a previous report, we found heterozygous male mice to have normal blood pressures. Homozygous mutant mice also have severe renal disease. The renal papilla is markedly reduced, and the intrarenal arteries exhibit vascular hyperplasia associated with a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. These animals cannot effectively concentrate urine. They also have an abnormally low urinary sodium to potassium ratio despite reduced levels of aldosterone. Homozygous mutant male mice sire significantly smaller litters than wild-type male mice; however, no defect in sperm number, morphology, or motility was detected. ACE-deficient animals demonstrate the role of this enzyme in systemic blood pressure, renal development and function, and male fertility.
The marked increase in cocaine consumption observed in recent decades, has led to the identification of previously unknown multiple medical problems. Cardiovascular complications related to cocaine abuse include myocardial ischemia and infarction, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, rhythm disturbances and sudden death, endocarditis, pneumopericardium and left ventricular hypertrophy. Although the mechanisms involved in cocaine-related cardiac diseases are multiple, many cardiac complications in these patients are caused in part or totally by an increase in adrenergic activity due to the blockade of catecholamine reuptake induced by the drug.
Autism, a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder manifested by deficits in social behavior and interpersonal communication, and by stereotyped, repetitive behaviors, is inexplicably biased towards males by a ratio of ∼4∶1, with no clear understanding of whether or how the sex hormones may play a role in autism susceptibility. Here, we show that male and female hormones differentially regulate the expression of a novel autism candidate gene, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-alpha (RORA) in a neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y. In addition, we demonstrate that RORA transcriptionally regulates aromatase, an enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen. We further show that aromatase protein is significantly reduced in the frontal cortex of autistic subjects relative to sex- and age-matched controls, and is strongly correlated with RORA protein levels in the brain. These results indicate that RORA has the potential to be under both negative and positive feedback regulation by male and female hormones, respectively, through one of its transcriptional targets, aromatase, and further suggest a mechanism for introducing sex bias in autism.
Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, progressive and incurable disease, which has been associated with the intake of appetite suppressant drugs. The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite suppressants. Thirty-five patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months (1992-1994) in Belgium. Exposure to appetite-suppressants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview. Twenty-three of the patients had previously taken appetite suppressants, mainly fenfluramines, as compared with only 5 of the controls (66 versus 6%, p<0.0001). Five patients died before the interview, all of them had taken appetite suppressants. In 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain, 5 of them had taken appetite suppressants. The patients who had been exposed to appetite suppressants tended to be on average more severely ill, and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. A policy of unrestricted prescription of appetite suppressants may lead to a high incidence of associated primary pulmonary hypertension. Intake of appetite suppressants may accelerate the progression of the disease.
Leiomyomas are rare esophageal disorders, although among the benign esophageal neoplasms, they are the most common. Multiple leiomyomas are distinguished from esophageal leiomyomatosis, an extremely rare condition, which is associated with Alport syndrome, showing deletions and rearrangements of the COL4A5/COL4A6 gene. There are only a few reports of diffuse multilocular lesions. A 19-year-old man presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and diffuse abdominal pain. On endoscopy multiple nodules covered with intact mucosa were present, the largest tumor arising from the gastro-esophageal border infiltrating the cardia. Barium swallow demonstrated narrowing of the middle and lower esophagus with the upper third of the stomach filled by the tumor. Thorax and abdominal CT scans revealed infiltration of almost the total aboral esophagus by the tumor with compression of left and right bronchi. The infiltration reached the whole lesser curvature of the stomach. Endosonography showed multiple encapsulated nodules. Due to the extended tumor growth with infiltration of the upper third of the stomach, a total esophago-gastrectomy with reconstruction by colon interposition was performed. On histopathological examination multiple esophageal leiomyomas with infiltration of the proximal third of the stomach was shown. Immunohistochemically the tumor stained positive for desmin and sm-actin and negative for CD34 and c-kit. Genetic analysis ruled out a deletion of the COL4A5/COL4A6 locus on chromosome X that is linked with Alport syndrome-diffuse leiomyomatosis. Extended mutations in the COL4A5 gene, associated with Alport syndrome, to the COL4A6 gene, are required for the development of leiomyomatosis. In young patients with diffuse multinodular infiltration by encapsulated tumors, esophageal leiomyomatosis should be considered. If the proximal third of the stomach is infiltrated by the tumor an extended resection is necessary. Reconstruction procedures include colon interposition.
Subjective complaints, including those traditionally considered tricyclic antidepressant side effects, were studied in 43 depressed inpatients during a three-week trial of desipramine hydrochloride. Multiple regression analysis was employed to examine the independent relationship of pretreatment symptoms, concurrent depression, and plasma drug concentrations to subjective complaints reported during treatment. As a group, subjective complaints were positively associated with pretreatment symptoms and the concurrent severity of depression, but not with plasma desipramine concentration. Of the 23 individual complaints studied, three increased during treatment and nine improved. Only two complaints, tremors and light-headedness, were significantly associated with plasma drug concentration. The data indicate that during initial treatment of severe depression with desipramine, subjective complaints are more likely to be symptoms of depression than side effects of the drug and that plasma desipramine determinations would not be useful for predicting or avoiding these complaints. The best management of most symptoms studied was adequate treatment of the depression.
A patient with pancytopenia, severe sensory neuropathy, and a six-year history of excessive vitamin intake showed portal hypertension on evaluation. A liver biopsy revealed hypervitaminosis A. His sensory findings were characteristic of a recently described syndrome of sensory neuropathy secondary to megadoses of vitamin B6. The patient's neuropathy has improved, but his pancytopenia has persisted. The practice of ingesting large doses of vitamins is increasing in a considerable segment of our population. Many claims of therapeutic benefit have been made, but few have been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Although there are indications for the use of large dosages of certain vitamins, they are rare. Physicians should be aware of the toxicities of megavitamin therapy.
A 32-year-old man had acute renal failure after ingesting amphetamines. The renal biopsy findings indicated acute interstitial nephritis. In contrast to other reports, which indicate an association between coexisting rhabdomyolysis, hyperpyrexia, or necrotizing angiitis and acute renal failure in amphetamine abusers, our case suggests that amphetamine alone may cause acute renal injury.
We report a patient who developed aplastic anemia after three courses of cyclohexylchloroethylnitrousurea (CCNU), procarbazine and oncovine administered after craniotomy and irradiation for brain astrocytoma. To the best of our knowledge, aplastic anemia following CCNU has not been reported previously. The unique course of the disease and implications of this complication are discussed.
Intravenous administration of dipyridamole during radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) was performed in 26 consecutive patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease. The authors compared the results of dipyridamole-RNV with those of ergometer exercise-RNV in detecting myocardial ischemia. During exercise, ST depression, regional wall motion (RWM) abnormalities, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were observed in 21 (81%), 23 (88%), and 20 (77%) patients, respectively. However, after intravenous dipyridamole, ST depression, RWM abnormalities, and decreased LVEF were observed in 14 (54%), 15 (58%), and 2 (8%) patients, respectively. Although LVEF usually decreases during myocardial ischemia, LVEF did not decrease (57 +/- 11% to 58 +/- 10%), even in patients with ST depression, after intravenous dipyridamole. Maintained left ventricular ejection fraction is considered to be a hemodynamic effect of the potent arterial vasodilatation induced by dipyridamole. These results from dipyridamole-RNV in myocardial ischemia seem to conflict with the results from dipyridamole-thallium studies carried out to determine the capacity to detect coronary artery disease. Unknown mechanisms of dipyridamole other than the coronary steal phenomenon may be operative in the genesis of myocardial ischemia.
Hydroxychloroquine, a quinoline compound, rarely causes ototoxicity. According to the few reports in existence, hydroxychloroquine-induced ototoxicity occurred following prolonged therapy in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. We report a case of unilateral sensorineural hearing loss in a 7-year-old girl with idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis, after 2 years of hydroxychloroquine treatment. Sensorineural hearing loss has previously been reported with hydroxychloroquine treatment, but this is the first report in a child and associated to idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis and has the characteristic of being unilateral.
To evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of vinorelbine (VNB) administered as a single agent in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma.
Forty-six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy. Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response. VNB was administered weekly as a 25-mg/m2 short intravenous (i.v.) infusion.
Six of 30 patients (20%) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response (PR) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8% to 39%). The median duration of response was 21 weeks (range, 17 to 28). One of 16 patients (6%) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response (CR) of 31 weeks' duration (95% CI, 0% to 30%). The overall response rate (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) was 15% (CR, 2%; PR 13%; 95% CI, 6% to 29%). The median dose-intensity (DI) was 20 mg/m2/wk. VNB was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred. At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 59% of patients. A grade 2 or 3 infection occurred in 16% of patients, but no toxic deaths occurred. Other side effects were rare, and peripheral neurotoxicity has been minor (26% grade 1).
These data indicate that VNB is an active agent in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Given its excellent tolerance profile and low toxicity, further evaluation of VNB in combination therapy is warranted.
Succinylcholine is used during induction of anesthesia, and it may induce fasciculations. In this study we demonstrated that intravenous diazepam (1 mg/kg) or lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) can decrease fasciculations induced by succinylcholine. There is no significant difference between these two drugs in reducing fasciculations moreover, these drugs can also prevent raised blood pressure and heart rate during intubation.
Clozapine has recently been associated with venous thromboembolism. The aim of this study was to describe three elderly patients in whom olanzapine therapy was associated with venous thromboembolism. During a 4-month period at the same psychogeriatric clinic, three elderly patients (an 89-year-old male, a 78-year-old male and an 83-year-old female) developed deep venous thrombosis shortly after treatment with olanzapine was initiated. Two of the patients also had symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. None had previously been diagnosed with venous thromboembolism. These cases indicate that venous thromboembolism might be associated with the use of olanzapine, at least in geriatric patients. Subjects treated with olanzapine should be monitored clinically for venous thromboembolism to ensure early detection and prompt intervention, and a possible discontinuation of treatment with olanzapine should be considered after a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.
Anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a rare but life-threatening adverse effect of aromatic anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine, although there is extensive experience with AHS related to these anticonvulsants. Very few cases of lamotrigine-associated AHS have been reported in bipolar patients and most reported cases were published in non-psychiatric journals. The authors describe here the occurrence of an AHS in a 48-year-old bipolar woman who was treated with lamotrigine, valproic acid and venlafaxine for her depressive symptoms. She developed a high fever, generalized maculopapular rash, pancytopenia, pneumonitis and hepatitis after we added lamotrigine to valproate and venlafaxine. These adverse drug reactions resolved after the discontinuation of lamotrigine and valproate, and the administration of oral antihistamine and corticosteroid. Our case demonstrates that the most important steps in the management of lamotrigine-associated AHS are to recognize the disorder, discontinue the offending anticonvulsants, provide supportive care in an inpatient setting, and treat with antihistamine and steroids when appropriate.
Anthracyclines are very effective antineoplastic agents for the treatment of acute leukemia. Early and late dose-related cardiotoxicity can occur. We present a 33 year old women who developed a reversible right heart failure fifteen days after receiving a treatment with doxorubicine. Severe regional wall motion abnormalities were appreciated through two-dimensional and Doppler-flow echocardiography, there was no evidence of impaired systolic or diastolic left ventricle function. Two weeks later, remission of acute right ventricle failure was obtained, echocardiographic assessment was normal at this time. Incidence of right ventricle abnormalities after treatment is discussed.
A multicenter long-term study at 13 urologic clinics in Germany and Austria tested the efficacy and safety of a papaverine (15 mg/ml) and phentolamine (0.5 mg/ml) mixture (ANDROSKAT) in achievement of pharmacologically aided erection. The study population of 157 men with chronic erectile dysfunction received a total of 559 injections administered by physicians, to establish the individual minimal dose of the mixture needed by each patient for a rigid erection. Rigidity sufficient for intercourse was achieved by 94% of these men. In the second phase of the study, 92 men administered a total of 4717 self-injections (mean 51.2, SD 7.7), with an average follow-up of 14 months. The mean therapeutic dose was 1.02 ml (SD 0.72). The latency time to full erection averaged 10.3 min (SD 5.5). The average duration of the erection induced was 67.1 min (SD 40.8, min. 11.2, max. 236). Sexual intercourse, orgasm and ejaculation were reported following 90%, 88% and 86%, respectively, of all injections. In the initial diagnostic phase, prolonged erections were seen in 13 patients (3%) and minor bruises at the injection site in 12 men. Side effects of self-injection during home therapy were pain (1.2%), haematoma (2.6%) and prolonged erection (0.9%). We conclude that self-injection with a combination of papaverine and phentolamine is an efficient and safe long-term treatment for erectile dysfunction.
In six normal volunteers hyperprolactinemia was induced by sulpiride (150 mg/day) for 10 days. Both before and during sulpiride hCG was injected; the higher testosterone response to hCG, when PRL levels were enhanced, suggests a possible stimulatory role of PRL on Leydig cells.
The recognition that copper is essential but also potentially toxic to humans has prompted the search for biomarkers of copper excess. The experimental approach followed here involves the isolation and subsequent characterization of copper-binding molecules (CuBP) from human erythrocytes. Incubation (0-60 min) of freshly obtained erythrocytes in the presence of increasing concentrations of copper (10-50 microM; as 64Cu-histidine) led to time- and concentration-dependent uptake of the radioisotope. A near-maximal incorporation was attained after 20 min, with 45-55% of the radioactivity being recovered in 20,000 x g hemolysate supernatants (S-20). 64CuBP from S-20 were separated by size exclusion and metal-affinity chromatography. Most radioactivity loaded into a Sephadex G-75 column was recovered in association with molecules of MMr greater than 60 KDa (largely accounted for by hemoglobin; Hb). Only negligible amounts of radioactive Cu were associated with metallothionein. With further purification, the higher MMr 64Cu-binding fractions were resolved by Sephadex G-200 into two major peaks. The cpm/microg protein ratios of the first peak (high MMr) were proportional to the concentrations of copper presented to the erythrocytes. The second one contained mostly Hb molecules. Proteins from the first peak were concentrated in an affinity chromatography mini-column, suited to trap CuBP. The higher-affinity CuBP were eluted as a single peak which comprised around 60% of the load. An SDS-PAGE analysis of such peak reveals the presence of three bands, of which two are non-hemoglobin Cu-binding proteins. The latter, whose identity remains to be established, had MMr of approximately 30 and 40 KDa, respectively. Preliminary data indicate that the two bands bind 64Cu within a range of concentrations, relevant to those expected to occur during copper over-exposure conditions.
Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of heart failure. Half of cases are believed to be hereditary, and mutations in cardiac sarcomeric contractile protein genes have been reported with autosomal dominant inheritance. We used mutation analysis suitable for identification of both dominant and recessive mutations to investigate the sarcomeric gene for cardiac troponin I (TNNI3) in 235 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. We identified a novel TNNI3 mutation in a family with recessive disease. Functional studies showed impairment of troponin interactions that could lead to diminished myocardial contractility. TNNI3 is the first recessive gene identified for this condition, and we suggest that other such genes could be pinpointed by mutation analyses designed to identify homozygous mutations.
Glycogen storage disease type III (GSD-III) is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from deficient glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE) activity. A child with GDE deficient in both liver and muscle (GSD-IIIa) had recurrent hypoglycemia, seizures, severe cardiomegaly, and hepatomegaly and died at 4 years of age. Analysis of the GDE gene in this child by single-strand conformation polymorphism, followed by direct DNA sequencing and restriction analysis, revealed an insertion of a nucleotide A into position 4529 of the GDE cDNA (4529insA). This insertion resulted in substitution of a tyrosine to a stop codon at amino acid 1510 (Y1510X). The 4529insA mutation appeared to be homozygous in this patient and was not found in 20 unrelated controls or 18 other GSD-III patients (14 GSD-IIIa and 4 GSD-IIIb). This is the first identification of a disease mutation in this gene, and the data suggest that homozygous 4529insA may be associated with a severe phenotype in GSD-IIIa.
Chronic use of morphine is accompanied by the development of morphine tolerance, which is one of the major problems associated with opiate treatment. Possible modulation of opioid effects by melanocortin receptor ligands has been recently demonstrated. Therefore, we investigated the influence of repeated intrathecal injection of a melanocortin receptor antagonist (SHU9119, JKC-363) on the development of morphine tolerance as measured by tail-flick test. It was also examined whether a single i.t. SHU9119 and JKC-363 administration could counteract the loss of analgesic potency of morphine in morphine tolerant rats. We examined also the influence of chronic morphine administration on mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4-R) mRNAs in the rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) during morphine tolerance. Morphine treatment (10mg/kg, i.p. twice daily) over 8 days induced tolerance as reflected by a significant reduction of withdrawal latency from 181 to 25% above baseline in the tail-flick test. Repeated co-administration of morphine and SHU9119 or JKC-363, significantly prevented the development of morphine tolerance. A single administration of an MC4-R antagonist restored morphine analgesic potency in morphine tolerant rats. Using RT-PCR we demonstrated no changes in the spinal cord but there was a decrease in MOR and increase in MC4-R gene expression in the DRG of rats tolerant to morphine. These results suggest that MC4-R may be involved in the mechanisms of opioid tolerance and antagonists of this receptor may be a possible new target in the search for strategies preventing the development of opioid tolerance.
Danazol, a C17 alkylated anabolic steroid, has been tried as a hormonomodulator in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus. We report the case of a patient receiving 400 mg of danazol per day who developed mild pancreatitis associated with hepatitis, both induced by danazol.
Prolonged calcineurin inhibitor maintenance therapy in kidney allograft recipients is complicated by the development of chronic irreversible drug-induced nephrotoxicity (CNIT).
In 304 de novo renal graft recipients, the association among tacrolimus exposure indices (dose, C(0), AUC(0-12h)), CYP3A5, CYP3A4 and ABCB1 polymorphisms, clinical covariables and de novo arteriolar hyalinization as a histologic sign of CNIT was examined.
Tacrolimus C(0) and AUC(0-12h) at 3 and 12 months posttransplantation did not differ between patients with and without CNIT. Patients who developed CNIT more often carried the CYP3A5*1 allele (32.4% versus 15.2%, P = 0.01). Twenty-five percent of recipients with tacrolimus dose requirements exceeding 0.2 mg/kg per day at 3 months posttransplantation developed CNIT, whereas 16.2% of patients with dose requirements between 0.10 and 0.20 mg/kg per day and 4.5% of patients who needed less than 0.10 mg/kg per day developed CNIT (P < 0.0001). These early differences in tacrolimus dose requirements between recipients with and without CNIT persisted during subsequent follow-up. In a Cox proportional hazards analysis, the CYP3A5*1 allele (hazard ratio: 2.38; 95% confidence interval: 1.15-4.92) or tacrolimus dose range (hazard ratio: 2.06; 95% confidence interval: 1.30-3.27) and continued corticosteroid therapy (hazard ratio: 4.75; 95% confidence interval: 1.13-19.98) were independently associated with CNIT. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significant difference in CNIT-free survival (93.5% versus 81.8% versus 66.9%; log-rank test: P = 0.0006) between patients with, respectively, tacrolimus dose requirements less than 0.1, 0.1 or greater, less than 0.2, and 0.2 mg/kg per day or greater. More patients with CNIT sustained graft loss during follow-up (32.3% versus13.7%, P = 0.004).
High early tacrolimus dose requirements, predominantly but not exclusively encountered in CYP3A5*1 expressers, are associated with the development of calcineurin inhibitor-related nephrotoxicity, especially in recipients who continue corticosteroid therapy.
Studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of anxiety disorder patients to challenge tests. Our aim was to observe if panic disorder (PD) patients and generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) and performance social anxiety disorder (PSAD) patients respond in a similar way to the induction of anxiety symptoms and panic attacks by an oral caffeine challenge test. We compared 28 PD patients, 25 GSAD patients, 19 PSAD, and 26 control subjects after a 480-mg caffeine test. The patients had not received psychotropic drugs for at least a 4-week period. In a randomized double-blind experiment performed in two occasions 7 days apart, 480 mg of caffeine and a caffeine-free solution were administered and anxiety scales were administered before and after each test. A panic attack was induced in 17 (60.7%) PD patients, 4 (16.0%) GSAD patients, and 10 (52.6%) PSAD patients, during the caffeine test. None of the control subjects had a panic attack after the caffeine intake. Neither patients nor any control subject had a panic attack after drinking the caffeine-free solution. Our data suggest that there is an association between PD and PSAD hyperreactivity to an oral caffeine challenge test. The PD and PSAD patients had a higher number of induced panic attacks, some specific anxiety symptoms, and a more severe anxiety response than GSAD patients and normal volunteers.
Advanced psychophysical tests, performed in 42 epileptic patients, show that the antiepileptic drugs phenytoin and carbamazepine can specifically affect the retinal function, while Valproic Acid and the epileptic seizures do not. The Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue and Panel D-15 désaturé tests revealed an accumulation of errors along the tritan/tetartan axis (blue colour vision deficiencies) and a high total error score. The same defect was shown by measurement of the spectral sensitivity functions. The results obtained for mesopic vision and especially glare sensitivity measured by nyktometry were markedly affected in these patients compared to a normal population. The enhanced sensitivity to glare is mainly the only one symptom complained by the patient. We propose a screening method for early detection of phenytoin- and carbamazepine-induced neurotoxicity. The literature of ocular side effects of anticonvulsant drugs is carefully reviewed.
