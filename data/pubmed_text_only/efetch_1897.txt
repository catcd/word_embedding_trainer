The conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase and lipid peroxidation were measured in brain from carbon monoxide- (CO) poisoned rats. Sulfhydryl-irreversible xanthine oxidase increased from a control level of 15% to a peak of 36% over the 90 min after CO poisoning, while the conjugated diene level doubled. Reversible xanthine oxidase was 3-6% of the total enzyme activity over this span of time but increased to 31% between 90 and 120 min after poisoning. Overall, reversible and irreversible xanthine oxidase represented 66% of total enzyme activity at 120 min after poisoning. Rats depleted of this enzyme by a tungsten diet and those treated with allopurinol before CO poisoning to inhibit enzyme activity exhibited no lipid peroxidation. Treatment immediately after poisoning with superoxide dismutase or deferoxamine inhibited lipid peroxidation but had no effect on irreversible oxidase formation. Biochemical changes only occurred after removal from CO, and changes could be delayed for hours by continuous exposure to 1,000 ppm CO. These results are consistent with the view that CO-mediated brain injury is a type of postischemic reperfusion phenomenon and indicate that xanthine oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species are responsible for lipid peroxidation.
Eleven patients with delusions of infestation were treated with pimozide using a double-blind crossover technique. Ten out of 11 patients improved. The investigation showed significant relief of itch and delusions during pimozide treatment. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) points decreased significantly. Adverse effects were few by 2 patients showed dose-related depressive reactions during treatment. Pimozide treatment of patients with delusions of infestation should be entrusted to dermatologists, because these patients with delusions differ from most patients attending psychiatric clinics in that they have a monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis.
The findings in clinical trials of antiarrhythmic drug efficacy and safety are frequently difficult to compare, since study design often has an important effect on trial outcome. To explore this problem further, we compared three designs--randomized control, nonrandomized control, and uncontrolled--collectively enrolling 2415 patients in 21 trials reporting on the role of quinidine in the prevention of chronic atrial fibrillation. The proportion of patients remaining in sinus rhythm at 3, 6, and 12 months after cardioversion was calculated by means of Kaplan-Meier techniques, and the data were pooled for each trial design. For the randomized control trials the difference in the absolute percentage of patients remaining in sinus rhythm in the quinidine and control groups was 24% at each of the three follow-up intervals. Contrary to findings in the randomized control trials, the magnitude of the treatment benefit in nonrandomized trials was smaller and declined markedly over time. The percentage of patients remaining in sinus rhythm in the uncontrolled trials was intermediate to the percentages in the other two trial designs. When the data from all three trial designs were pooled, the crude mortality rate was 2.0% in quinidine-treated patients and 0.6% in control patients. Sudden cardiac death or ventricular fibrillation was the cause of death in 13 of 19 patients for whom the cause of death was known, highlighting the potential risk of quinidine-induced proarrhythmia. Although quinidine is effective in maintaining sinus rhythm, estimates of the treatment effect vary among trial types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Although β-adrenoceptor (β-AR) blockade is an important mode of therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF), subcellular mechanisms associated with its beneficial effects are not clear. Three weeks after inducing myocardial infarction (MI), rats were treated daily with or without 20 and 75 mg/kg atenolol, a selective β(1) -AR antagonist, or propranolol, a non-selective β-AR antagonist, for 5 weeks. Sham operated rats served as controls. All animals were assessed haemodynamically and echocardiographically and the left ventricle (LV) was processed for the determination of myofibrillar ATPase activity, α- and β-myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms and gene expression as well as cardiac troponin I (cTnI) phosphorylation. Both atenolol and propranolol at 20 and 75 mg/kg doses attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and lung congestion in addition to increasing LV ejection fraction and LV systolic pressure as well as decreasing heart rate, LV end-diastolic pressure and LV diameters in the infarcted animals. Treatment of infarcted animals with these agents also attenuated the MI-induced depression in myofibrillar Ca(2+) -stimulated ATPase activity and phosphorylated cTnI protein content. The MI-induced decrease in α-MHC and increase in β-MHC protein content were attenuated by both atenolol and propranolol at low and high doses; however, only high dose of propranolol was effective in mitigating changes in the gene expression for α-MHC and β-MHC. Our results suggest that improvement of cardiac function by β-AR blockade in CHF may be associated with attenuation of myofibrillar remodelling.
Exposure to nickel sulfate (NiSO(4)) leads to impaired olfaction and anosmia through an unknown mechanism. We tested the hypothesis that ATP is released following NiSO4-induced injury and that ATP promotes regenerative cell proliferation in the olfactory epithelium (OE). Male Swiss Webster mice were intranasally instilled with NiSO(4) or saline followed by ATP, purinergic receptor antagonists, or saline. We assessed the olfactory epithelium for NiSO(4)-induced changes using histology and immunohistochemistry 1-7 days postinstillation and compared results to olfactory bulb ablation-induced toxicity. Intranasal instillation of NiSO(4) produced a dose- and time-dependent reduction in the thickness of turbinate OE. These reductions were due to sustentacular cell loss, measured by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining at 1-day postinstillation and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of olfactory sensory neurons at 3 days postinstillation. A significant increase in cell proliferation was observed at 5 and 7 days postinstillation of NiSO(4) evidenced by BrdU incorporation. Treatment with purinergic receptor antagonists significantly reduced NiSO(4)-induced cell proliferation and posttreatment with ATP significantly increased cell proliferation. Furthermore, posttreatment with ATP had no effect on sustentacular cell viability but significantly reduced caspase-3-dependent neuronal apoptosis. In a bulbectomy-induced model of apoptosis, exogenous ATP produced a significant increase in cell proliferation that was not affected by purinergic receptor antagonists, suggesting that ATP is not released during bulbectomy-induced apoptosis. ATP is released following NiSO(4)-induced apoptosis and has neuroproliferative and neuroprotective functions. These data provide therapeutic strategies to alleviate or cure the loss of olfactory function associated with exposure to nickel compounds.
In a 73-year-old woman with trimalleolar fracture, secondary acute ischemia of the limb and renal failure developed in association with heparin-dihydroergotamine thromboprophylaxis. Earlier cases of thromboprophylaxis-related angiospasm are briefly reviewed. The condition is infrequent, but trauma of extremities and shock are risk factors. Renal failure is rare.
3-Acetyl-2,5-diaryl-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were designed, synthesized, and tested as inhibitors against human monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B isoforms. Several compounds, obtained as racemates, were identified as selective MAO-B inhibitors. The enantiomers of some derivatives were separated by enantioselective HPLC and tested. The R-enantiomers always showed the highest activity. Docking study and molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated the putative binding mode. We conclude that these 1,3,4-oxadiazoles derivatives are promising reversible and selective MAO-B inhibitors.
Through a large-scale case-control association study using 52,608 haplotype-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we identified a susceptible locus for myocardial infarction (MI) on chromosome 22q12.1. Following linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, haplotype analyses revealed that six SNPs in this locus, all of which were in complete LD, showed markedly significant association with MI (chi2=25.27, P=0.0000005; comparison of allele frequency, 3,435 affected individuals versus 3,774 controls, in the case of intron 1 5,338 C>T; rs2331291). Within this locus, we isolated a complete cDNA of a novel gene, designated myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT). MIAT has five exons, and in vitro translation assay showed that MIAT did not encode any translational product, indicating that this is likely to be a functional RNA. In vitro functional analyses revealed that the minor variant of one SNP in exon 5 increased transcriptional level of the novel gene. Moreover, unidentified nuclear protein(s) bound more intensely to risk allele than non-risk allele. These results indicate that the altered expression of MIAT by the SNP may play some role in the pathogenesis of MI.
In a previous study, it was found that a ginseng berry extract with a high content of the ginsenoside Re normalized blood glucose in ob/ob mice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the ginsenoside Re on insulin resistance of glucose transport in muscles of rats made insulin resistant with a high-fat diet.
Rats were fed either rat chow or a high-fat diet for 5 weeks. The rats were then euthanized, and insulin stimulated glucose transport activity was measured in epitrochlearis and soleus muscle strips in vitro.
Treatment of muscles with Re alone had no effect on glucose transport. The high-fat diet resulted in ~50% decreases in insulin responsiveness of GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface and glucose transport in epitrochlearis and soleus muscles. Treatment of muscles with Re in vitro for 90 min completely reversed the high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance of glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation. This effect of Re is specific for insulin stimulated glucose transport, as Re treatment did not reverse the high-fat diet-induced resistance of skeletal muscle glucose transport to stimulation by contractions or hypoxia.
Our results show that the ginsenoside Re induces a remarkably rapid reversal of high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance of muscle glucose transport by reversing the impairment of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface.
Drug-induced acute renal failure has been reported in relation to many drugs, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents included. A case is described in which allergic acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) was caused by tolmetin. Although the use of steroids has been recommended in AIN they were not used for this patient, who made a complete recovery.
Daily treatment of female rats with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) protected against 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxicity. This protective effect was associated with reduced microsomal lipid peroxidation, increased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity and decreased aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity. Retinol acetate (vitamin A) inhibited lipid peroxidation, elevated GSH-PX activity, and enhanced AHH activity. Thirty per cent of vitamin A-treated animals were alive 25 d after a lethal dose of TCDD. d-alpha-Tocopherol (vitamin E) inhibited markedly microsomal lipid peroxidation, enhanced AHH activity, and had no effect on GSH-PX activity. Only 10% of the vitamin E-treated animals were alive 25 d after a lethal dose of TCDD. The mechanism of TCDD toxicity may involve in part inhibition of GSH-PX activity with resultant lipid peroxidation by hydrogen peroxide.
The effects of alpha,beta-amyrin, a pentacyclic triterpene isolated from Protium heptaphylum was investigated on rat model of orofacial pain induced by formalin or capsaicin. Rats were pretreated with alpha,beta-amyrin (10, 30, and 100mg/kg, i.p.), morphine (5mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle (3% Tween 80), before formalin (20 microl, 1.5%) or capsaicin (20 microl, 1.5 microg) injection into the right vibrissa. In vehicle-treated controls, formalin induced a biphasic nociceptive face-rubbing behavioral response with an early first phase (0-5 min) and a late second phase (10-20 min) appearance, whereas capsaicin produced an immediate face-rubbing (grooming) behavior that was maximal at 10-20 min. Treatment with alpha,beta-amyrin or morphine significantly inhibited the face-rubbing response in both test models. While morphine produced significant antinociception in both phases of formalin test, alpha,beta-amyrin inhibited only the second phase response, more prominently at 30 mg/kg, in a naloxone-sensitive manner. In contrast, alpha,beta-amyrin produced much greater antinociceptive effect at 100mg/kg in the capsaicin test, which was also naloxone-sensitive. These results provide first time evidence to show that alpha,beta-amyrin attenuates orofacial pain at least, in part, through a peripheral opioid mechanism but warrants further detailed study for its utility in painful orofacial pathologies.
The light/dark cycle and suprachiasmatic nucleus rhythmicity are known to have important influences on reproductive function of rodents. We studied reproductive function in female heterozygous and homozygous brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1 (Bmal1, also known as Arntl) null mice, which lack central and peripheral cellular rhythms. Heterozygous Bmal1 mice developed normally and were fertile, with apparent normal pregnancy progression and litter size, although postnatal mortality up to weaning was high (1.1-1.3/litter). The genotype distribution was skewed with both heterozygous and null genotypes underrepresented (1.0:1.7:0.7; P<0.05), suggesting loss of a single Bmal1 allele may impact on postnatal survival. Homozygous Bmal1 null mice were 30% lighter at weaning, and while they grew at a similar rate to the wild-type mice, they never achieved a comparable body weight. They had delayed vaginal opening (4 days), disrupted estrus cyclicity, and reduced ovarian weight (30%). Bmal1 null mice had a 40% reduction in ductal length and a 43% reduction in ductal branches in the mammary gland. Surprisingly, the Bmal1 mice ovulated, but progesterone synthesis was reduced in conjunction with altered corpora lutea formation. Pregnancy failed prior to implantation presumably due to poor embryo development. While Bmal1 null ovaries responded to pregnant mare serum gonadotropin/human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation, ovulation rate was reduced, and the fertilized oocytes progressed poorly to blastocysts and failed to implant. The loss of Bmal1 gene expression resulted in a loss of rhythmicity of many genes in the ovary and downregulation of Star. In conclusion, it is clear that the profound infertility of Bmal1 null mice is multifactorial.
Transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric plasma protein that, in conditions not yet completely understood, may aggregate, forming the fibrillar material associated with TTR amyloidosis. A number of reported experiments indicate that dissociation of the TTR tetramer occurs prior to fibril formation, and therefore, studies aiming at the discovery of compounds that stabilize the protein quaternary structure, thereby acting as amyloid inhibitors, are being performed. The ability of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to act as a competitive inhibitor for the thyroid hormone binding to TTR indicated a possible stabilizing effect of DES upon binding. Here we report the crystallographic study of DES binding to TTR. The structural data reveal two different binding modes, both located in the thyroxine binding channel. In both cases, DES binds deeply in the channel and establishes interactions with the equivalent molecule present in the adjacent binding site. The most remarkable features of DES interaction with TTR are its hydrophobic interactions within the protein halogen binding pockets, where its ethyl groups are snugly fitted, and the hydrogen bonds established at the center of the tetramer with Ser-117. Experiments concerning amyloid formation in vitro suggest that DES is effectively an amyloid inhibitor in acid-mediated fibrillogenesis and may be used for the design of more powerful drugs. The present study gave us further insight in the molecular mechanism by which DES competes with thyroid hormone binding to TTR and highlights key interactions between DES and TTR that oppose amyloid formation.
In freshwater fish, aluminum is a well-recognized gill toxicant, although responses are influenced by pH. Aluminum nanomaterials are being used in diverse applications that are likely to lead to environmental release and exposure. However, it is unclear if the effects of nanoparticulate aluminum are similar to those of other forms of aluminum or require special consideration. To examine the acute toxicological effects of exposure to aluminum nanoparticle (Al-NP)s, adult female zebrafish were exposed to either Al-NPs or aluminum chloride for up to 48 hours in moderately hard fresh water. Al-NPs introduced into test water rapidly aggregated and up to 80% sedimented from the water column during exposures. No mortality was caused by concentrations of Al-NP up to 12.5 mg/L. After exposure, tissue concentrations of aluminum, effects on gill morphology, Na+, K+ -ATPase (NKA) activity, and global gene expression patterns were examined. Exposure to both aluminum chloride and nanoparticulate aluminum resulted in a concentration dependent decrease in sodium potassium ATPase activity, although Al-NP exposure did not alter gill morphology as measured by filament widths. Decreased ATPase activity coincided with decreases in filamental NKA staining and mucous cell counts. Analysis of gill transcriptional responses demonstrated that exposure to 5 mg/L Al-NP only resulted in significant changes in expression of two genes, whereas aluminum chloride exposure significantly affected the expression of 105 genes. Taken together, these results indicate that nanoparticulate aluminum has little acute toxicity for zebrafish in moderately hard freshwater.
Nicotine is known to be associated with adverse effects in infants and children. It is concentrated in breast milk and is absorbed by the infant. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on breast-fed rat pups of maternal nicotine exposure during lactation.
In the experimental group (n = 6), nicotine was given to lactating dams (2 mg/kg/day) after delivery and continued for 10 days during lactation. Control animals (n = 4) received saline for the same duration. The suckling rats were weighed and killed on postnatal day 10, and samples were taken from the lung, liver, kidney, spleen and small intestine for histopathological examination. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in the liver of the dam and the offspring.
Histopathological changes in the liver of the nicotine-exposed group showed portal inflammatory infiltrate, ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, and focal necrosis in the parenchyma. Thickening of alveolar walls because of interstitial inflammation was noted in the lungs. Histopathological examination of kidney, spleen and small intestine tissue did not reveal any abnormality. In the experimental group, SOD and CAT activities were significantly decreased (p <0.001) but MDA levels were significantly increased (p <0.001) compared with the control group.
These results indicate that maternal nicotine exposure induces oxidative stress and causes detrimental histopathological changes in the lung and liver of lactating offspring.
Overdose of acetaminophen (APAP) can cause acute liver injury that is sometimes fatal, requiring efficient pharmacological intervention. The traditional Chinese herb Bupleurum falcatum has been widely used for the treatment of several liver diseases in eastern Asian countries, and saikosaponin d (SSd) is one of its major pharmacologically-active components. However, the efficacy of Bupleurum falcatum or SSd on APAP toxicity remains unclear. C57/BL6 mice were administered SSd intraperitoneally once daily for 5days, followed by APAP challenge. Biochemical and pathological analysis revealed that mice treated with SSd were protected against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. SSd markedly suppressed phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and reversed the APAP-induced increases in the target genes of NF-κB, such as pro-inflammatory cytokine Il6 and Ccl2, and those of STAT3, such as Socs3, Fga, Fgb and Fgg. SSd also enhanced the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Il10 mRNA. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SSd protects mice from APAP-induced hepatotoxicity mainly through down-regulating NF-κB- and STAT3-mediated inflammatory signaling. This study unveils one of the possible mechanisms of hepatoprotection caused by Bupleurum falcatum and/or SSd.
To study the possible apoptosis-inducing effect of arsenic trioxide on human hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cells, and its molecular mechanisms.
Arsenic trioxide action on the cell growth, apoptosis, periodicity and the expression of related genes in two human hepatocarcinoma cell lines QGY-7701 and QGY-7703, and normal humanhepatic cell line L-02 in vitro was observed by MTT assay, acridine orange (AO) /ethidiumbromide (EB) fluorescent staining, electron microscopy detection, DNA gel electrophoresis, flow cytometry, TUNEL assay and immunohistochemical staining.
Arsenic trioxide could strongly inhibit the growth of human hepatocarcinoma cells QGY-7701 and QGY-7703 with the cell cycle arrested on S phase, and induce the apoptosis of the cells with bcl-2 gene expression down-regulated and bax and Fas gene expression up-regulated. But arsenic trioxide had no obvious effect on the normal hepatic cells.
Arsenic trioxide has significant selective apoptosis-inducing effect on the human hepatocarcinoma cells, which is regulated by several genes. The results provide the credible experimental basis for clinically treating HCC with arsenic trioxide.
High dose of cytosine arabinoside is usually used in treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. Here we report 1 case of a child who developed neurologic toxicity and rapidly improved after flushing out of cerebral spinal fluid, suggesting it could be treatment in the acute phase of toxicity. Efficacy of this treatment could be explained by reducing cytosine arabinoside metabolites in central nervous system.
