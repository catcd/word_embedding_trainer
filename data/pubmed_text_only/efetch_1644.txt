Two very low birth weight infants who developed renal candidiasis with pelvicalyceal fungal concretions were treated medically with Amphotericin B and 5 Fluorocytosine. Two months following cessation of therapy, the fungal concretions decreased in size, became sterile and developed calcification in residual debris. The calcifications was still present at demise in one patient and at 18 months follow up in the other. These calcifications occurred in the absence of simultaneous furosemide therapy.
Coronary artery inflammation in Kawasaki disease is accompanied by thrombocytosis and platelet activation. It was hypothesized that abnormal metabolism of bioactive eicosanoids could result from or contribute to these events. Circulating plasma thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E were measured by double antibody radioimmunoassay in patients with Kawasaki disease before and after aspirin alone or aspirin and intravenous gamma globulin therapy. Plasma prostaglandin E concentrations were normal in all patient groups. Pretreatment thromboxane B2 was elevated compared with age-matched controls, fell moderately with high-dose aspirin (60 to 100 mg/kg/day) and marginally increased with low-dose aspirin (3 to 5 mg/kg/day) 6 to 8 weeks after treatment. Plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was not detected in 12 of 16 patients before therapy and remained low in all but 1 patients by 6 to 8 weeks. Thromboxane B2 correlated weakly with serum salicylate concentration but had no relation to platelet mass. The results in these patients with Kawasaki disease indicate only partial thromboxane suppression and depressed prostacyclin generation regardless of therapy. This balance favors coronary vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation capable of potentiating myocardial ischemia or infarction. The results justify consideration of higher or more frequent aspirin doses for longer duration and thromboxane receptor blockade in this disease.
Postanesthesia bradycardia or asystole before electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) occurs very infrequently but is a potentially fatal complication of pre-ECT anesthesia. The optimal strategy for the prevention of its recurrence is unclear because the use of premedication with atropine may not always be successful. In this article, we present the case of a 21-year-old man with schizophrenia who developed bradycardia directly after receiving succinylcholine during the first 3 ECT sessions. Replacing succinylcholine with mivacurium seemed to be a successful strategy in preventing bradycardia during the final 9 ECT sessions.
The effects of amiloride hydrochloride on thiazide-induced hypokalemia were evaluated. In metabolic balance studies, amiloride reversed thiazide-induced urinary potassium loss, restored plasma bicarbonate concentration and pH to pretreatment levels, and produced further increases in aldosterone secretion. Effects of long-term administration of hydrochlorothiazide and an amiloride-hydrochlorothiazide combination were compared in outpatients who had experienced thiazide-induced hypokalemia while receiving oral potassium supplements. After eight weeks, those given hydrochlorothiazide alone had an average serum potassium level of 3.01 +/- 0.08 mEq/L). Those given the amiloride-hydrochlorothiazide combination had an average serum potassium level of 3.75 +/- 0.008 mEq/L, not significantly different from the control value (3.82 +/- 0.08 mEq/L). Both groups had increased plasma aldosterone concentrations and plasma renin activity. The potassium-conserving effect of amiloride persisted with extended therapy.
A double-blind, randomized trail was conducted in 823 patients who required long-term analgesic therapy for chronic pain such as that caused by osteoarthritis, fibromyopathies or fibromyalgias, other nonarticular chronic soft tissue pain syndromes, or headaches. The safety and analgesic efficacy of ketorolac tromethamine 10 mg 4 times a day as needed was compared with that of aspirin 650 mg 4 times a day as needed. The primary emphasis of this 52-week study was on evaluating the safety of the drugs. Patients returned to the clinics at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52 weeks for assessments of safety and efficacy. Both patients' and investigators' evaluations of overall efficacy and safety favored ketorolac over aspirin. The probability of early withdrawal from the study was significantly higher with aspirin than with ketorolac, primarily because of lack of efficacy. Early withdrawal for safety-related reasons alone was similar for those taking aspirin and ketorolac.
Five patients developed neurological symptoms during treatment with amiodarone for intervals ranging between five and 40 months. In each case the daily maintenance dose did not exceed 600 mg. The neurological manifestations included gait ataxia, tremor, polyneuropathy, and myopathy. In all five patients, the neurological symptoms were severe and disabling. In one patient with a myopathy, there was no improvement after amiodarone was withdrawn. The neurological side effects of amiodarone may be disabling and are not always reversible with drug withdrawal. Neurological complications may arise during treatment with usual maintenance doses.
ABSTRACT Background Methadone has been associated with QT prolongation and Torsades de pointes. Ciprofloxacin may prolong QT interval and induce Torsades de pointes when other risk factors are present. Case description A case is described in which a patient receiving methadone treatment developed Torsades de pointes following the addition of ciprofloxacin. Conclusion Ciprofloxacin should be used with caution in patients receiving methadone.
Pulmonary hypoplasia (PH) is the main cause of mortality in newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Prenatal administration of retinoic acid (RA) stimulates alveologenesis in the nitrofen-induced pulmonary hypoplasia. Insulin-like growth factor receptors (IGFRs) play a crucial role in alveologenesis during lung development. We recently demonstrated that IGFRs were downregulated in later stages of lung development in the nitrofen CDH model. Several studies suggest the ability of RA to regulate insulin-like growth factor signaling. We hypothesized that IGFRs pulmonary gene expression is upregulated after the administration of RA in the nitrofen-induced CDH model.
Pregnant rats were exposed to either olive oil or nitrofen on day 9 (D9) of gestation. RA was given intraperitoneally on days D18, D19, and D20. Fetal lungs were dissected on D21 and divided into control, control + RA, CDH, and CDH + RA group. IGFRs gene and protein expression were determined using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
mRNA expression levels of IGFRs were significantly increased in control + RA and CDH + RA compared with CDH group. Immunoreactivity of IGFRs was markedly increased in control + RA and CDH + RA compared with CDH lungs.
Upregulation of pulmonary gene and protein expression of IGFRs after prenatal RA treatment in the nitrofen model suggests that RA may promote lung growth by stimulating IGFRs mediated alveologenesis.
The aim of this study was to compare the virological and biochemical relapse rates in Asian chronic hepatitis B patients with lamivudine-induced hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, between those who stopped therapy after HBeAg seroconversion and those who continued to receive lamivudine.
All patients with lamivudine-induced HBeAg seroconversion were included. Patients who stopped lamivudine after HBeAg seroconversion (n=22) were compared with 79 patients who continued to receive lamivudine (n=79). Demographic, virological, and biochemical parameters were recorded at baseline, and throughout the duration of follow-up.
In patients who stopped lamivudine, the median follow-up after stopping lamivudine was 20 months. Of these patients, 14 (64%) had virological rebound, with a cumulative incidence of 82% at 4 years. There was no significant difference in number of flares between patients with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and undetectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA at the time of stopping lamivudine compared with that in patients with either abnormal ALT, detectable HBV DNA, or both (P=0.73). The cumulative incidence of HBeAg seroreversion and ALT flares at 5 years after stopping lamivudine was 9 and 44%, respectively. Of the 79 patients who continued with lamivudine, 62 (78%) had undetectable HBV DNA at the time of last follow-up, whereas no patients had undetectable HBV DNA after stopping lamivudine (P<0.001). The cumulative incidence of ALT flares at 5 years was 16% (P<0.001 compared with those who stopped taking lamivudine). After a median treatment duration of 79 months, lamivudine-resistant mutations occurred in eight patients (10%).
In Asian HBeAg-positive patients, continuing with lamivudine after achieving HBeAg seroconversion was associated with a higher proportion of undetectable HBV DNA and a lower number of ALT flares, when compared with those with cessation of lamivudine. In patients who achieved HBeAg seroconversion with lamivudine, the resistance rate was not high when treatment was continued after HBeAg seroconversion.
1-(Tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-5-fluorouracil (Thf-FU), which is named Ftorafur or FT-207 and is used clinically as an antitumor agent, was conveniently synthesized by condensation of the trimethylsilyl derivative of 5-fluorouracil with 2-acetoxytetrahydrofuran using NaI as a catalyst. This optically inactive Thf-FU was resolved into optically active (R)-(+)- and (S)-(-)-Thf-FU in high optical purity and excellent yield by formation of diastereoisomers with brucine. 13C NMR data were obtained on Thf-FU and related compounds and the antibacterial activities and in vivo antitumor activities of these isomers were tested. The degradations of these isomers to 5-fluorouracil by liver microsomes were also examined. No significant differences were found in any of these properties of these isomers.
A 38-year-old patient with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder received fluvoxamine in a clinical study. Psychometric ratings showed marked clinical improvement in the third week of fluvoxamine administration, but after 8 weeks, at a dose of 300 mg per day, he suffered a grand mal seizure after drinking a glass of beer (0.2 liter). He had no history of previous epileptic seizures. Careful neurological evaluation including computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no signs of acute disease. EEG before the fit did not show epileptiform activity; after the fit, spikes and spike-wave complexes appeared, which disappeared upon discontinuation of fluvoxamine. Since his obsessive-compulsive symptoms had responded well to fluvoxamine and worsened after its discontinuation, the drug was cautiously reintroduced. Improvement of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms was observed again, but spikes and spike-wave complexes reappeared at a dose of 50 mg per day. Under anticonvulsant treatment with carbamazepine, fluvoxamine was increased to 100 mg per day. No seizures occurred during a follow-up to two years.
Seizures are common after severe cerebral ischemia. To examine the mechanisms underlying these seizures, we determined the impact of prior forebrain ischemia on the seizure thresholds of four convulsants with differing modes of action: lidocaine, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and picrotoxin. Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically instrumented with screw electrodes and vascular catheters, and then subjected to 10 min of forebrain ischemia, produced by carotid occlusion and hypotension (mean arterial pressure to 30 mmHg). Animals were then awakened. 6, 24 or 48 h later, groups of awake animals received intravenous infusions of the four drugs. The total dose of drug infused prior to either electrical seizures (lidocaine, PTZ, and picrotoxin) or tonic-clonic convulsions (all drugs) were noted. For each drug, a group of Sham animals (no ischemia) served as controls. There were markedly different patterns of changes in the convulsant thresholds for the drugs. For example, at 6 h post-ischemia, rats treated with lidocaine died before convulsing, while the threshold for PTZ increased by 86%. There was no change in the picrotoxin threshold at 6 h, but the dose of NMDA needed to induce tonic-clonic seizure activity was reduced by 70%. By 48 h, lidocaine and PTZ thresholds had returned to values similar to those in Shams, but the NMDA threshold had now increased to a value 62% greater than Sham. Ten minutes of cerebral ischemia is followed by a complex and changing pattern of susceptibility to chemical convulsants. Finding suggests that early post-ischemic seizures may be related to increased NMDA receptor sensitivity.
Although little is known about migration of hematopoietic stem cells and their neoplastic counterparts into tissues and peripheral blood, adhesion proteins likely play an important role. We studied 339 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) to discern the relationship between adhesion protein expression, circulating blasts, and white blood cell (WBC) count. Expression levels of CD11b and CD11c strongly correlated with increased WBC count, independent of FAB subtype (p<0.0001). However, 93% (25/27) of cases of AML-M3 completely lacked beta2 integrin expression, compared to 11% (35/312) of the non-M3 cases (p<0.0001). Seven of the 27 patients with AML-M3 were followed during standard induction therapy with ATRA. Within 3 days, weak CD11c became detectable, followed by CD11b and CD11a. Our data suggest an important link between beta2 integrin expression and the level of circulating leukemic cells in AML. We demonstrate the clinical usefulness of a panel of beta2 integrins (CD11a, CD11b and CD11c) in accurate prediction of AML-M3, and recommend inclusion of this immunophenotypic analysis to identify patients who require ATRA therapy. Finally, we illustrate the rapidity at which AML-M3 blasts up-regulate beta2 integrins, and suggest a possible association between this finding and the tissue infiltration that characterizes the "ATRA syndrome".
The role of corticotropin-releasing factor in autonomic regulation of heart rate, heart rate variability and behavior responses was investigated in two genetic mouse models: corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1-deficient mice, and corticotropin-releasing factor-transgenic mice overexpressing corticotropin-releasing factor. Heart rate was recorded by radio-telemetry during novelty exposure and auditory fear conditioning. Locomotor activity and freezing served as behavioral indices. Locomotor activity and heart rate were invariably increased in response to novelty exposure in both corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1-deficient mice and littermate wild-type controls. The heart rate responses during retention of conditioned auditory fear and the exponential relationship between heart rate and heart rate variability were unaffected by genotype. Moreover, conditioned fear responses inferred from multiple behavioral measures including freezing did not differ between corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1-deficient and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 wild-type control mice. Corticotropin-releasing factor-transgenic mice exhibited markedly reduced locomotor activity during novelty exposure when compared with littermate wild-type controls. Baseline and novelty-driven heart rate was slightly elevated in corticotropin-releasing factor-transgenic mice, whereas the novelty-induced increase of heart rate was not different between genotypes. In contrast, corticotropin-releasing factor-transgenic mice did not display a heart rate response indicative of conditioned auditory fear. It is concluded that corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1-deficiency does not affect heart rate adjustment and behavioral responses to acute fearful stimuli. The resiliency of behavioral and cardiovascular patterns elevation argues against the involvement of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 in acute emotional regulation on these two functional levels despite an absent corticosterone elevation in corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1-deficient mice. It is hypothesized that the lack of a conditioned heart rate response in corticotropin-releasing factor-transgenic mice is attributable to an impairment of cognitive function. The results are compared with those of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2-deficient mice, and the role of the corticotropin-releasing factor system in cardiovascular regulation is discussed.
Investigation of the combination of the taxanes with doxorubicin in the treatment of breast cancer has logically progressed, with the ultimate goal of identifying a safe and effective regimen for use in the adjuvant setting. Initial phase II findings of the concurrent doxorubicin/paclitaxel combination resulted in substantial response rates, but at a high cost. A much higher percentage of patients than expected developed anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. Subsequent phase II and phase III trials have determined administration schedules of doxorubicin/paclitaxel that reduce the risk for cardiotoxicity. However, the overall response rate is only modestly improved over sequential single-agent therapy or standard doxorubicin-containing combination therapy. The lack of cardiotoxicity with docetaxel, its high antitumor activity, and its linear pharmacokinetics have made it an attractive taxane for combination with doxorubicin. In addition, it is easily administered in the outpatient setting. Phase I/II trials of the combination of doxorubicin/docetaxel resulted in high response rates with a lack of adverse modification of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. These findings have been confirmed in a large phase III randomized trial where overall response rates and time to disease progression were significantly improved, but the incidence of cardiomyopathy was not different for the doxorubicin/docetaxel versus doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) regimen. Ongoing studies are underway to assess the role of the doxorubicin/docetaxel combination in the adjuvant setting as primary chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. It is here that the most benefit on survival of breast cancer patients is likely to be shown. At the same time, it is in the adjuvant setting where the absence of potentially late cardiac and other toxicities must be assured.
The prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis is high. Patch testing is the standard procedure to detect contact sensitivity. More than 3000 allergens are known, today. On the basis of the data of this study the top allergens are presented.
The retrospective analysis is based on the patch test results collected by the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology in 2004. Data of 9948 patients (6175 female und 3773 male) referred for the evaluation of suspected contact allergy were analysed to determine the frequency of sensitization to the 10 most common contact allergens.
The top ten allergens were nickel sulphate (frequency of sensitization standardized for sex and age 17.2 %), fragrance mix (7.2 %), balsam of Peru (6.7 %), cobalt chloride (6.5 %), potassium dichromate (5.3 %), colophony (4.6 %), lanolin alcohol (4.3 %), p-phenylenediamine (4.2 %), ammoniated mercury (3.5 %) und methyldibromoglutaronitrile/phenoxyethanol (3.4 %) in 2004.
Even after healing of the skin lesions of allergic contact dermatitis, it must be considered that sensitization persists indefinitely. Therefore, patients have to be informed exactly about their relevant contact allergens to ensure complete avoidance. To do so, physicians need a detailed knowledge of the most common contact allergens which are discussed in this paper.
Status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most serious manifestations of epilepsy. Systemic inflammation and damage of blood-brain barrier (BBB) are etiologic cofactors in the pathogenesis of pilocarpine SE while acute osmotic disruption of the BBB is sufficient to elicit seizures. Whether an inflammatory-vascular-BBB mechanism could apply to the lithium-pilocarpine model is unknown. LiCl facilitated seizures induced by low-dose pilocarpine by activation of circulating T-lymphocytes and mononuclear cells. Serum IL-1beta levels increased and BBB damage occurred concurrently to increased theta EEG activity. These events occurred prior to SE induced by cholinergic exposure. SE was elicited by lithium and pilocarpine irrespective of their sequence of administration supporting a common pathogenetic mechanism. Since IL-1beta is an etiologic trigger for BBB breakdown and its serum elevation occurs before onset of SE early after LiCl and pilocarpine injections, we tested the hypothesis that intravenous administration of IL-1 receptor antagonists (IL-1ra) may prevent pilocarpine-induced seizures. Animals pre-treated with IL-1ra exhibited significant reduction of SE onset and of BBB damage. Our data support the concept of targeting systemic inflammation and BBB for the prevention of status epilepticus.
To report the case of a patient with manic-depressive disorder who developed lithium intoxcation following carbamazepine-induced acute renal failure.
A 33-year-old white man with bipolar manic-depressive disorder was treated with lithium for the last 18 months. Three weeks prior to admission, carbamazepine 600 mg was added to the drug regimen due to a recurrence of the psychiatric disorder. He was admitted wh signs of lithium intoxication. Acute renal failure due to carbamazepine-induced interstitial nephritis was diagnosed.
The combination of carbamazepine and lithium is known to cause neurotoxicity. We describe a different interaction in which the toxic lithium concentrations were the result of carbamazepine-induced acute renal failure.
When considering adding carbamazepine to lithium, careful follow-up of the patients is warranted to prevent this indirect drug in interaction.
Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the antitumour activity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) against colorectal cancer will allow the development of more effective and specific chemopreventative agents. Modulation of the NF-kappaB pathway has been implicated as a key effector of the antitumour effect of aspirin, but the effects of non-aspirin NSAIDs on this pathway have yet to be fully defined. Here, we demonstrate that sulindac, sulindac sulfone and indomethacin activate the NF-kappaB pathway in colorectal cancer cells, as determined by western blot analysis of cytoplasmic levels of IkappaBalpha and immunocytochemical analysis of nuclear NF-kappaB/RelA. Furthermore, we show that all of these NSAIDs induce nucleolar translocation of the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB. Using RelA deleted for the previously described nucleolar localization signal, we demonstrate that this response is causally involved in the apoptotic effects of these agents. Finally, we demonstrate that NSAID-mediated nucleolar translocation of RelA is associated with downregulation of NF-kappaB-driven transcription and of the NF-kappaB target gene, ICAM-1. These data identify nucleolar translocation of RelA and the associated repression of the NF-kappaB-driven transcription as a central molecular mechanism of NSAID-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis. As well as providing new understanding of the molecular determinants of RelA function, these findings also have relevance to the development of novel chemotherapeutic and chemopreventative agents.
By hypomethylating genes, decitabine may up-regulate factors required for chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity. Platinum-resistant cells may have reduced expression of the copper/platinum transporter CTR1.
Thirty-one patients with refractory malignancies received decitabine 2.5 to 10 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5, and 8 to 12 or 15 to 20 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5. Tumor was assessed for DNA methylation (by LINE assays), apoptosis, necrosis, mitoses, Ki67, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1), CTR1, and p16.
Febrile neutropenia was dose limiting. One thymoma patient responded. Decitabine decreased tumor DNA methylation (from median 51.2% predecitabine to 43.7% postdecitabine; P = 0.01, with effects at all doses) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (from 65.3-56.0%). There was no correlation between tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients starting decitabine < or =3 versus >3 months after last prior cytotoxic or targeted therapy had lower predecitabine tumor CTR1 scores (P = 0.02), higher p16 (P = 0.04), and trends (P = 0.07) toward higher tumor methylation and apoptosis. Decitabine decreased tumor DNMT1 for scores initially >0 (P = 0.04). Decitabine increased tumor apoptosis (P < 0.05), mitoses (if initially low, P = 0.02), and CTR1 (if initially low, P = 0.025, or if < or =3 months from last prior therapy, P = 0.04). Tumor CTR1 scores correlated inversely with methylation (r = -0.41, P = 0.005), but CTR1 promoter was not hypermethylated. Only three patients had tumor p16 promoter hypermethylation. P16 scores did not increase. Higher blood pressure correlated with lower tumor necrosis (P = 0.03) and a trend toward greater DNA demethylation (P = 0.10).
Exposure to various cytotoxic and targeted agents might generate broad pleiotropic resistance by reducing CTR1 and other transporters. Decitabine decreases DNA methylation and augments CTR1 expression through methylation-independent mechanisms.
Various risk factors for the development of acute renal failure (ARF) have been pointed out clinically. Hypotension, excessive aminoglycoside exposure, and dehydration were identified as highly significant acute insults. Adenine nucleotide level in the renal tissue and morphological changes were investigated to clarify the recovery of renal tissue after gradual impairment caused by the administration of low molecular weight dextran (LMWD) and Kanamycin (KM) in water-deprived rats. Male SD rats, deprived of water for 2 days, received various dosages of LMWD (10, 15, 20, 30 ml/kg, i.p.) and KM (300 mg/kg, s.c.) concomitantly. The rats were killed on the 5th day and the level of adenine nucleotide in the renal tissue was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The kidney was examined by electron microscopy. For comparison, LMWD and KM were administered to a second group of rats in tap water ad libitum, using the same dosages. The group dehydrated rats was more liable to have ARF. Electron microscopy disclosed changes in the kidney, indicating a disorder of the lysosome of the epithelial cells, not the mitochondria, of the proximal tubules. In this group, a decrease in Energy Charge value (EC = (ATP + 1/2ADP)/(ATP + ADP + AMP)) occurred later than both functional and morphological impairments. Both the EC values and the microscopic examination of the rats with the LMWD.KM-induced ARF showed that water deprivation greatly increased the potential for ARF. The degree of renal impairment depended on the dosage of LMWD. Both excessive aminoglycoside exposure and water deprivation were significant risk factors.
High concentrations of lithium in drinking water were previously discovered in the Argentinean Andes Mountains. Lithium is used worldwide for treatment of bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant depression. One known side effect is altered thyroid function.
We assessed associations between exposure to lithium from drinking water and other environmental sources and thyroid function.
Women (n=202) were recruited in four Andean villages in northern Argentina. Lithium exposure was assessed based on concentrations in spot urine samples, measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Thyroid function was evaluated by plasma free thyroxine (T4) and pituitary gland thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), analyzed by routine immunometric methods.
The median urinary lithium concentration was 3,910 μg/L (5th, 95th percentiles, 270 μg/L, 10,400 μg/L). Median plasma concentrations (5th, 95th percentiles) of T4 and TSH were 17 pmol/L (13 pmol/L, 21 pmol/L) and 1.9 mIU/L, (0.68 mIU/L, 4.9 mIU/L), respectively. Urine lithium was inversely associated with T4 [β for a 1,000-μg/L increase=-0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.31 to -0.068; p=0.002] and positively associated with TSH (β=0.096; 95% CI, 0.033 to 0.16; p=0.003). Both associations persisted after adjustment (for T4, β=-0.17; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.015; p=0.032; for TSH: β=0.089; 95% CI, 0.024 to 0.15; p=0.007). Urine selenium was positively associated with T4 (adjusted T4 for a 1 μg/L increase: β=0.041; 95% CI, 0.012 to 0.071; p=0.006).
Exposure to lithium via drinking water and other environmental sources may affect thyroid function, consistent with known side effects of medical treatment with lithium. This stresses the need to screen for lithium in all drinking water sources.
The association between heterocyclic aromatic amine (HCA) intake and prostate cancer (PCa) risk may be modified by genetic variation in enzymes involved in HCA metabolism. We examined this question in a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Heidelberg cohort. The study included 204 PCa cases and 360 matched controls. At baseline, participants provided dietary and lifestyle data and blood samples that were used for genotyping. Dietary HCA intake-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-3,4,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx-was estimated using information on meat consumption, cooking methods, and browning degree. Risk estimates for gene × HCA interactions were calculated by unconditional logistic regression. We found inverse associations between PhIP, MeIQx, or DiMeIQx intake and PCa risk when having <2 deletions of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes (P(interaction): 0.03, 0.01, and 0.03, respectively), which is supported by analysis of darkly browned meat consumption data. Statistically significant effect modification of both HCA (DiMeIQx) and darkly browned meat intake and PCa risk was observed for allelic variants of MnSOD (rs4880) (P(interaction): 0.02). Despite limitations due to study size, we conclude that the association between HCA intake and PCa risk could be modified by polymorphisms of GSTT1, GSTM1, and MnSOD.
A 71 year old patient developed a supraventricular tachycardia after the administration of nebulised ipratropium bromide.
The authors investigated the role of myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) receptor pathways in optic nerve head (ONH) astrocyte migration. They further investigated how the expression of these genes is altered by elevated hydrostatic pressure (HP).
PCR was used to determine the isoforms of MYLK expressed in ONH astrocytes. siRNAs against MYLK (all isoforms) and TGFbeta receptor 2 (TGFBR2) were prepared and tested for effects on the migration of cultured ONH astrocytes. Finally, the effects of elevated HP (24-96 hours) on the expression of MYLK isoforms and selected TGFbeta pathway components were measured.
Multiple isoforms of MYLK are present in ONH astrocytes from Caucasian (CA) and African American (AA) donors. Both populations express the short form (MYLK-130) and the long form (MYLK-210) of MYLK and a splicing variant within MYLK-210. MYLK-directed siRNA decreased MYLK expression and cell migration compared with control siRNA. siRNA directed against TGFbeta receptor 2 also decreased cell migration compared with control and decreased extracellular matrix genes regulated by TGFbeta signaling. Elevated HP increased the expression of MYLK-130 and MYLK-210 in both populations of astrocytes. However, TGFbeta2 was uniquely upregulated by exposure to elevated HP in CA compared with AA astrocytes.
Differential expression of TGFbeta pathway genes and MYLK isoforms observed in populations of glaucomatous astrocytes applies to the elevated HP model system. MYLK may be a new target for intervention in glaucoma to alter reactive astrocyte migration in the ONH.
