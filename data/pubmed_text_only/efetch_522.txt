Elevations in prolactin plasma concentration occur with antipsychotics due to their dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Hyperprolactinemia may be associated with both acute (galactorrhea, amenorrhea, decreased libido etc.) and chronic (predisposition to osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease) treatment emergent effects in both men and women associated with apparently impaired compliance. The aim of our study was to investigate these supposed effects regarding clinically relevant endocrinologic symptoms under routine treatment conditions with newer, atypical antipsychotics. Our findings confirm that amisulpride frequently leads to a remarkable elevation of prolactin plasma concentration, same--in minor degree--for risperidone. Under treatment with quetiapine and olanzapine just temporary elevated prolactin levels were registered. However, no correlation between prolactin levels and dosage could be found. In females treated with amisulpride acute hormonal side effects were seen in a clinically relevant manner. Features of illness itself, stress factors, concomitant medication or other patient's conditions are supposed to be relevant factors for acute endocrine symptomatology.
Ozone (O(3)), an oxidant air pollutant in photochemical smog, principally targets epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract. However, changes in gene expression have also been reported in livers of O(3)-exposed mice. The principal aim of the present study was to determine if acute exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of O(3) could cause exacerbation of drug-induced liver injury in mice. Overdose with acetaminophen (APAP) is the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury in developed countries. In the present study, we examined the hepatic effects of acute O(3) exposure in mice pretreated with a hepatotoxic dose of APAP. C57BL/6 male mice were fasted overnight and then given APAP (300 mg/kg ip) or saline vehicle (0 mg/kg APAP). Two hours later, mice were exposed to 0, 0.25, or 0.5 ppm O(3) for 6 h and then sacrificed 9 or 32 h after APAP administration (1 or 24 h after O(3) exposure, respectively). Animals euthanized at 32 h were given 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine 2 h before sacrifice to identify hepatocytes undergoing reparative DNA synthesis. Saline-treated mice exposed to either air or O(3) had no liver injury. All APAP-treated mice developed marked centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis that increased in severity with time after APAP exposure. O(3) exposure increased the severity of APAP-induced liver injury as indicated by an increase in necrotic hepatic tissue and plasma alanine aminotransferase activity. O(3) also caused an increase in neutrophil accumulation in livers of APAP-treated animals. APAP induced a 10-fold increase in the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled hepatocytes that was markedly attenuated by O(3) exposure. Gene expression analysis 9 h after APAP revealed differential expression of genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular regeneration in mice treated with APAP and O(3) compared to APAP or O(3) alone, providing some indications of the mechanisms behind the APAP and O(3) potentiation. These results suggest that acute exposure to near ambient concentrations of this oxidant air pollutant may exacerbate drug-induced liver injury by delaying hepatic repair.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia to occur in humans. Several predisposing substrates such as increasing age, heart failure, hypertension and valvular heart disease have been identified. The use of illicit drugs as the substrate for AF is not frequently recognized.
Riddelliine is a representative pyrrolizidine alkaloid, a class of naturally occurring toxic phytochemicals present in plant species worldwide. Human exposure to pyrrolizidine alkaloids occurs through consumption of herbal dietary supplements, including comfrey, and through contaminated livestock products (e.g., milk). A recently completed 2-year bioassay of riddelliine carcinogenicity showed that male and female rats and male mice, but not female mice, developed liver tumors. The toxicokinetics of riddelliine and two metabolites, the N-oxide and retronecine, were determined in serum following an oral gavage dose in male and female rats and mice using a validated liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometric method. The results are consistent with extensive metabolism of riddelliine and its more polar metabolites prior to excretion. It is concluded that factors other than toxicokinetics are responsible for the observed species/sex specificity of gross toxicity or liver tumor induction in rats and mice.
Stroke is a well-documented complication of amphetamine abuse. Methylphenidate, chemically and pharmacologically similar to amphetamines, is widely used in the treatment of attention deficit disorder in children. The possibility of vasculitis connected to methylphenidate should not be surprising. A case is reported of stroke associated with ingestion of methylphenidate in an 8-year-old boy. Family history was negative and other causes of vasculitis were excluded. We draw your attention to the risk of using methylphenidate for a long period of time.
Ketoprofen (KP) is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis and various rheumatic diseases. Currently, KP is applied topically on skin as gel to treat symptoms of pain and inflammation. We have studied the photomodification of KP under natural environmental conditions. KP generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) like ¹O₂ through Type-II photodynamic reaction. ¹O₂ mediated 2'-dGuO photodegradation, single and double strand breakage were significantly induced by photosensitized KP under sunlight/UV-R exposure. Significant intracellular ROS generation was measured through DCF-DA fluorescence. Linoleic acid photoperoxidation and role of ¹O₂ were substantiated by using specific quencher like sodium azide. KP induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and cell death through MTT assay. We found apoptosis as the pattern of cell death which was confirmed through caspase-3 activation, cytochrome-c release from mitochondria, up-regulation of Bax protein and phosphatidylserine translocation. Our RT-PCR result strongly supports our view point of apoptotic cell death through up-regulation of p21 and pro-apoptotic Bax genes expression. Mitochondrial depolarization and lysosomal destabilization were also parallel to apoptotic process. Therefore, much attention should be paid to the topical application of KP and sunlight exposure in the light of skin related photosensitivity and cancers.
The modifying effect of four dose levels of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) on liver and bladder carcinogenesis by N-2-fluorenylacetamide (FAA) was studied in rats. FAA (200 ppm) was fed simultaneously with four levels of BHT (300, 1000, 3000, and 6000 ppm) to male F344 Fischer strain rats. Groups of animals were killed at 6, 12, 18, and 25 weeks. Hepatocellular-altered foci in the liver were identified histochemically by the exclusion of cellular iron after iron loading and by reaction for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. FAA alone induced altered hepatocellular foci which increased in number with duration of exposure, and by 25 weeks of feeding, 100% of rats had liver neoplasms. Concurrent feeding of BHT produced a dose-dependent reduction in the numbers of altered foci and the areas of liver sections occupied by histochemically altered cells, as well as a reduction in the incidence of liver neoplasms and the number of neoplasms per animal. These findings indicate that reduction of the number of foci at an early stage is predictive of reduced incidence of neoplasms at a late stage. Thus, BHT inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the hepatocarcinogenesis of concurrently fed FAA. However, although no bladder neoplasms occurred in rats given either BHT or FAA alone, groups fed BHT and FAA together developed bladder neoplasms in proportion to the dose of BHT. The effect of BHT on both liver and bladder carcinogenesis could be explained by BHT causing an alteration of the metabolism of FAA in the liver, resulting in less activation and greater urinary excretion of carcinogenic metabolites. In addition, BHT at high dose levels may exert a promoting effect on bladder carcinogenesis. Accordingly, it is suggested that the chemopreventive effect of phenolic antioxidants should be investigated with attention to the possibility that they not only inhibit carcinogenesis in the main target organs but also modify carcinogenesis in other organs.
4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane (4,4'-methylenedianiline) (DDPM) promoted the development of thyroid tumors in rats treated with a subeffective dose of N-bis(2-hydroxypropyl)nitrosamine (2,2'-dihydroxy-N-nitrosodipropylamine) (DHPN) for thyroid tumorigenesis. Male inbred W rats were given a single ip injection of 280 mg DHPN/100 g body weight and fed diets with or without 1,000 ppm DDPM. Thyroid tumor incidences at the end of week 20 of the experiment were 90% (19/21) in rats given DHPN and then DDPM and 28% (6/21) in rats given DHPN alone. The incidence of thyroid cancers was 9.5% (2/21) in rats first given DHPN and then DDPM. Untreated rats and rats given DDPM alone had no thyroid tumors after 20 weeks. Incidences of kidney tumors were 38% (8/21) in rats given DHPN and then DDPM and 28% (6/21) in rats given DHPN alone. No tumors were found in the kidneys and lungs of rats given DDPM alone and in those of control rats. Treatment with DDPM alone slightly but not significantly decreased the serum concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine; treatment with DHPN plus DDPM had no such effect.
The effect of a collagenous preparation Colocyl and its combination with proteolytic enzymes on the healing of soft tissue purulent wounds were studied in 239 patients. Colocyl and its combination with proteolytic enzymes were shown to facilitate the rejection of devitalized tissues, control of the inflammation and activation of reparative processes.
We evaluated the ability of mu [morphine, Tyr-Pro-N-MePhe-D-Pro-NH2 (PLO17)], delta (Tyr-D-Pen-Gly-Phe-D-Pen) (DPDPE) and kappa [U50,488H, (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-(1-pyr-rolidinyl) cyclo-hexyl)benzeneacetamine)] opioid receptor selective agonists to inhibit diarrhea induced by castor oil (0.6 ml p.o.) in mice after supraspinal (i.c.v.) and peripheral (s.c.) administration. The antidiarrheal potency of each compound was compared to its analgesic and gastrointestinal antitransit potency when given by the same route of administration. When administered i.c.v., morphine, PLO17 and DPDPE inhibited diarrhea in a dose-related fashion. The mu agonists, morphine and PLO17, given i.c.v, inhibited diarrhea at doses much lower than those needed to produce analgesia or to inhibit gastrointestinal transit. DPDPE (i.c.v.) was equipotent in inhibiting diarrhea and in eliciting analgesia, but did not effect the rate of transit. U50,488H (i.c.v.) inhibited diarrhea only at extremely high doses which also caused profound postural-motor incapacitance. U50,488H given i.c.v. had no effect on transit at any dose. When given peripherally, morphine, PLO17, DPDPE and U50,488H all inhibited diarrhea in a dose-related fashion. All four compounds inhibited diarrhea at doses much below those needed to cause analgesia. Morphine s.c. and PLO17 s.c. both inhibited diarrhea at doses lower than those required to inhibit transit. DPDPE s.c. and U50,488H s.c. had no effect on transit at any dose. The antidiarrheal effects of i.c.v. morphine, i.c.v. PLO17 and i.c.v. DPDPE were antagonized by pretreatment with 1 microgram i.c.v. of naltrexone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen drug used in the treatment of prostatic cancer. Hepatotoxic reactions due to flutamide have been reported with an incidence ranging from 1% to 5%. These reactions are usually reversible upon withdrawal of the drug but can occasionally be life-threatening. The mechanism of flutamide-associated hepatotoxicity is not well established. We report a case of a 69-year-old man with prostatic carcinoma in whom flutamide induced an acute hepatitis which resolved completely soon after drug withdrawal. In this patient, we have studied the possible involvement of an immunological mechanism in causing flutamide hepatitis by investigating the presence of circulating antibodies directed against reactive metabolites of flutamide bound to liver proteins with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Although, in the present case, we have failed to detect IgG reacting with rat liver microsomes incubated in vitro with flutamide, this does not completely rule out the possibility of an immunological involvement in flutamide hepatotoxicity. The possibility of severe flutamide-related injury, independently of the underlying pathogenic mechanism, strongly suggests the need for careful monitoring of liver enzymes in patients taking this drug.
A 20-year-old woman using an oral diet aid preparation containing phenylpropanolamine presented with an intracerebral hemorrhage and angiographic evidence of cerebral vasculitis. Gas chromatography demonstrated phenylpropanolamine in the urine. Even when used within recommended guidelines, phenylpropanolamine usage should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhage.
Imatinib is the standard of care for newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia. The largest randomized clinical trial of imatinib was the multinational IRIS trial in which 1106 patients were randomized to receive either imatinib 400 mg/day or a standard regimen of interferon-alpha plus cytarabine.
Patients were allowed to cross over to the opposite treatment for intolerance, lack of response, disease progression, and, following release of the initial efficacy data, reluctance to remain on therapy with interferon-alpha plus cytarabine. The safety and efficacy of imatinib in patients who crossed over from interferon-alpha plus cytarabine to imatinib is reported here.
Of 553 patients originally assigned to interferon-alpha plus cytarabine, 65% crossed over to imatinib, of whom 67% continue to receive treatment. After a median of 54 months of imatinib treatment on study, 93% achieved complete hematologic remission, 86% achieved major cytogenetic remission, and 81% achieved a complete cytogenetic remission as the best observed response. Estimated rates of freedom from progression to accelerated or blast phase and overall survival were 91% and 89%, respectively, at 48 months after starting imatinib.
This is the largest analysis to date describing the efficacy of imatinib in patients who have received prior therapies for chronic myeloid leukemia and it demonstrates excellent responses to this treatment. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00006343).
A primiparous, full-term, 28-year-old woman underwent an emergency lower segment Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia for failure to progress in the first stage. Despite an uneventful pregnancy and delivery, she developed a hypertensive crisis in the postoperative period complicated by acute pulmonary oedema requiring ventilation for 48 h in the intensive care unit. Intravenous magnesium sulphate infusions and hydralazine boluses were used to control the blood pressure, which was associated with clonus, hyperreflexia, tachycardia and profuse sweating. The patient made a good recovery. Later measurement of urinary catecholamines in the recovery phase showed greatly elevated levels of norepinephrine, dopamine and vanillyl mandelic acid. Further investigations included a normal abdominal computed tomography scan and a I-123 meta-iodo-benzyl-guanidine scintigraphy scan which revealed a 3- to 4-cm irregular tumour located at the level of the lower pole of the right kidney and further liver hot spots. Intravenous magnesium sulphate infusion proved successful in controlling hypertension caused by a phaeochromocytoma in the postpartum period.
To investigate the anti-liver fibrosis effect of total glucosides of Centella asiatica (GCA) in experimental rats.
Rat liver fibrosis model was induced by injecting dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) intraperitoneally for 6 weeks. Rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, the normal group, the model group, the positive control group treated by colchicine, and the three GCA groups treated by high, moderate and low dosage of GCA through gastrogavage started simultaneously with the modeling. At the end of the experiment, levels of serum total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN) were measured, and the pathology of liver tissue was observed.
The liver function in the GCA groups was improved, the levels of serum ALT, AST, HA were significantly lower than those in the model group (P < 0.05). Histopathological observation showed that GCA has significant anti-liver fibrosis effect.
GCA has significant preventive and therapeutic effect on DMN induced liver fibrosis in rats.
We present a patient who developed a mononucleosis syndrome 6 weeks after starting phenytoin therapy for a seizure disorder. Improvement followed initial discontinuation of the phenytoin, but near-fatal hepatic necrosis resulted from intravenous phenytoin rechallenge. A serious reaction with a 18% overall mortality, phenytoin hepatitis may closely resemble infectious mononucleosis with fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and atypical lymphocytosis. Continued administration of phenytoin or later rechallenge may increase the severity of the reaction.
The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria represent a serious clinical problem. Telavancin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antibiotic that possesses rapid in vitro bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens. Here we demonstrate that telavancin's antibacterial activity derives from at least two mechanisms. As observed with vancomycin, telavancin inhibited late-stage peptidoglycan biosynthesis in a substrate-dependent fashion and bound the cell wall, as it did the lipid II surrogate tripeptide N,N'-diacetyl-L-lysinyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine, with high affinity. Telavancin also perturbed bacterial cell membrane potential and permeability. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, telavancin caused rapid, concentration-dependent depolarization of the plasma membrane, increases in permeability, and leakage of cellular ATP and K(+). The timing of these changes correlated with rapid , concentration-dependent loss of bacterial viability, suggesting that the early bactericidal activity of telavancin results from dissipation of cell membrane potential and an increase in membrane permeability. Binding and cell fractionation studies provided direct evidence for an interaction of telavancin with the bacterial cell membrane; stronger binding interactions were observed with the bacterial cell wall and cell membrane relative to vancomycin. We suggest that this multifunctional mechanism of action confers advantageous antibacterial properties.
1. This study examined whether group III metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor agonists injected into the globus pallidus (GP), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) could reverse reserpine-induced akinesia in the rat. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, cannulated above the GP, SNr or third ventricle, were rendered akinetic with reserpine (5 mg kg(-1) s.c.). 18 h later, behavioural effects of the group III mGlu receptor agonists L-serine-O-phosphate (L-SOP) or L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) were examined. 3. In reserpine-treated rats, unilateral injection of L-SOP (2000 and 2500 nmol in 2.5 microl) into the GP produced a significant increase in net contraversive rotations compared to vehicle, reaching a maximum of 83+/-21 rotations 120 min(-1) (n=8). Pretreatment with the group III mGlu receptor antagonist methyl-serine-O-phosphate (M-SOP; 250 nmol in 2.5 microl) inhibited the response to L-SOP (2000 nmol) by 77%. Unilateral injection of L-SOP (250-1000 nmol in 2.5 microl) into the SNr of reserpine-treated rats produced a dose-dependent increase in net contraversive rotations, reaching a maximum of 47+/-6 rotations 30 min(-1) (n=6). M-SOP (50 nmol in 2.5 microl) inhibited the response to L-SOP (500 nmol) by 78%. 4. Following i.c.v. injection, L-SOP (2000-2500 nmol in 2.5 microl) or L-AP4 (0.5-100 nmol in 2 microl) produced a dose-dependent reversal of akinesia, attaining a maximum of 45+/-17 (n=8) and 72+/-3 (n=9) arbitrary locomotor units 30 min(-1), respectively. 6. These studies indicate that injection of group III mGlu receptor agonists into the GP, SNr or cerebral ventricles reverses reserpine-induced akinesia, the mechanism for which remains to be established.
Raynaud's phenomenon was observed in 8 out of 271 patients with malignant testicular tumours during or up to 14 months after combined cytostatic treatment. All patients with Raynaud's phenomenon were part of a group of 30 people having received vinblastine in a total dose of at least 2 mg/kg and bleomycin in a dose of 10 mg/kg. There were no other hints of Raynaud's syndrome from the history or chemical pathology. Compared to the experience of other authors Raynaud's phenomenon was observed less frequently and only at dosages of vinblastine and bleomycin considerably higher. This may possibly be due to use of steroids during combined cytostatic treatment with vinblastine and bleomycin.
The administration of the aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) to rats causes the nephrotic syndrome that is associated with an acute decline in renal function, and an interstitial infiltrate. We examined whether essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), which inhibits macrophage infiltration in glomerulonephritis, affects PAN-induced renal dysfunction. Both control and EFAD rats developed proteinuria that resolved over 28 d. After PAN administration, there was a prominent infiltration of macrophages in rats fed a normal diet. The infiltrate was prevented by the EFAD diet. The absence of a macrophage interstitial infiltrate was associated with a significantly higher Cin in the EFAD rats than in controls at 7 d (5.21 +/- 1.19 versus 0.39 +/- 0.08, P less than 0.002 ml/min/kg BW). In addition, CPAH fell to less than 10 ml/min/kg BW by day 7 in controls, but remained the same as normal in the EFAD. After administration of PAN to control rats, there was no increase in urinary thromboxane excretion or an increase in glomerular thromboxane production. Furthermore, the effect of EFAD could not be mimicked by the administration of a thromboxane synthase inhibitor. Irradiation-induced leukopenia in rats on a normal diet markedly improved glomerular filtration and renal blood flow in acutely nephrotic rats. EFAD prevents the interstitial cellular infiltrate and the renal ischemia associated with experimental nephrosis. The recruitment of mononuclear cells into the kidney following PAN directly contributes to the decline in renal function.
Fas ligand (FasL) -844T/C polymorphism (rs763110) has a demonstrated association with lung cancer risk. FasL -844CC with higher FasL expression has been suggested to contribute to tumor progression via immune escape. However, the impact of FasL -844T/C polymorphism on the clinical outcome of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains to be identified.
A total of 385 adjacent normal lung tissues from patients with NSCLC were collected to determine FasL -844T/C polymorphism by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism. FasL mRNA and protein expression in lung tumors were evaluated by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of FasL -844T/C polymorphism on survival and relapse was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models.
The FasL -844CC genotype had higher prevalence in those with advanced tumors than in those with early tumors (P = 0.008). In addition, patients with the FasL -844CC genotype were more prone to tumor relapse than those with the FasL -844TT+TC genotype (62.1% vs. 37.9%, P = 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients with the FasL -844CC genotype had poorer survival in terms of overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) than those with the FasL -844TT+TC genotype (24.1 vs. 42.8 months for OS, HR = 1.455, P = 0.004; 15.4 vs. 31.4 months for RFS, HR = 1.710, P < 0.001).
FasL -844T/C polymorphism may predict survival and relapse in NSCLC. We suggest that FasL may be a molecular target for immunotherapeutic interventions to improve the clinical outcome of patients with NSCLC. This finding should be validated by another investigative group.
Corticosteroids often induce steroid psychosis, a collection of heterogeneous syndromes with different pathophysiologic mechanisms. To date, no study has focused specifically on recurrent corticosteroid-induced mood disorders and considered their long-term outcome and treatment strategies.
Nine patients whose initial clinical presentation met DSM-IV criteria for a substance-induced mood disorder were identified by a review of medical records. Their clinical characteristics and treatments were examined.
All 9 corticosteroid-treated patients had a clinical course of bipolar disorder. Seven patients initially developed a manic or hypomanic state with subacute onset ranging from 1 to 3 months. Six patients had manic episodes accompanied by psychotic features. The proportion of manic episodes relative to total mood episodes of the 9 patients was 65.6%, suggesting manic predominance. Seven patients showed mood episodes that had no direct relationship to corticosteroid therapy and were preceded by various psychosocial stressors. Four of 5 patients who received steroid pulse therapy rapidly became manic or hypomanic. Antidepressants as well as mood stabilizers were useful for treatment of the present 9 patients.
Recurrent cases of corticosteroid-induced mood disorder have interesting clinical features, such as subacute onset, manic predominance, frequent accompanying psychotic features, and similar recurrent episodes in association with psychosocial stressors and corticosteroid use. Management, including psychopharmacologic intervention, should be indicated by a consideration of the underlying illnesses and psychosocial stressors.
In order to investigate the mechanism of PRL action on dopamine synthesis in tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons, in vitro dopamine synthesis in the median eminence of hypothalamic slices was compared between hyperprolactinemic and hypoprolactinemic rats, Hyper- and hypoprolactinemia were induced in ovariectomized rats by repetitive injections of the dopamine antagonist haloperidol (Halo) and the dopamine agonist bromocriptine (Bromo), respectively. In vitro dopamine synthesis in TIDA neurons was estimated by measuring 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) accumulated in the median eminence after incubation of hypothalamic slices with a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor. Treatment with Halo or Bromo produced increases or decreases, respectively, in the concentration of PRL in serum and in in vivo DOPA accumulation in the median eminence, as compared with vehicle treatment. The basal rate of in vitro DOPA accumulation in the median eminence was increased in Halo-treated rats and was decreased in Bromo-treated rats. The increase in basal DOPA accumulation after Halo treatment was inhibited by Ca2+ removal from medium or tetrodotoxin addition. A CA2+ -dependent increase in DOPA accumulation in the median eminence by depolarization was greater in Halo-treated rats than in Bromo-treated rats. This difference in DOPA accumulation was due to the changes in PRL secretion after Halo and Bromo treatments, since hypophysectomy abolished it. Incubation of hypothalamic slices in Na+-free media to increase the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ through inhibition of Na+-Ca2+ exchange caused an increase in DOPA accumulation. The rate of DOPA accumulation in Na+-free media was increased in Halo-treated rats and was decreased in Bromo-treated rats. On the other hand, neither Halo nor Bromo treatment altered the increase in DOPA accumulation induced by (Bu)2cAMP or forskolin. These results support the view that PRL stimulates dopamine synthesis in TIDA neurons by mechanisms which include an increase in the firing rate of TIDA neurons and increased depolarization-induced synthesis due to an enhanced response of the component that regulates dopamine synthesis to intracellular Ca2+.
Tristetraprolin (TTP) is the only trans-acting factor shown to be capable of regulating AU-rich element-dependent mRNA turnover at the level of the intact animal; however, the mechanism by which TTP mediated RNA instability is unknown. Using an established model system, we performed structure/function analysis with TTP as well as examined the current hypothesis that TTP function is regulated by p38-MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2) activation. Deletion of either the N- or C-terminal domains inhibited TTP function. Extensive mutagenesis, up to 16%, of serines and threonines, some of which were predicted to mediate proteasomal targeting, did not alter human TTP function. Mutation of the conserved MK2 phosphorylation sites enhanced human TTP function in both resting and p38-stress-activated protein kinase-MK2-activated cells. However, p38-stress-activated protein kinase-MK2 activation did not alter the activity of either wild-type or mutant TTP. TTP localized to the stress granules, with arsenite treatment reducing this localization. In contrast, arsenite treatment enhanced stress granule localization of the MK2 mutant, consistent with the involvement of additional pathways regulating this event. Finally, we determined that, in response to LPS stimulation, human TTP moves onto the polysomes, and this movement occurs in the absence of 14-3-3. Taken together, these data indicate that, although p38 activation alters TTP entry into the stress granule, it does not alter TTP function. Moreover, the interaction of TTP with 14-3-3, which may limit entry into the stress granule, is not involved in the downstream message stabilization events.
We studied various forms of dystonia associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in 207 patients who were on levodopa therapy for more than 1 year. Dystonia, sometimes more than one type, occurred in 63 (30%). In five patients, dystonia preceded initiation of treatment. Fifteen patients had peak-dose dystonia, 33 had early-morning dystonia, and 20 had "off-period" dystonia. The different clinical features of the dystonias are presented and compared. Findings indicate that dystonia is a frequent feature of levodopa-treated PD patients.
Recent reports suggest that adverse effects on sexual function occur in up to 50% of patients who are treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Previously cited low rates were more likely a function of underreporting than underoccurrence. There is less evidence about rates of dysfunction with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) antidepressants. The purpose of this report is to evaluate disturbances in sexual drive/desire and arousal/orgasm in 107 patients who met criteria for major depressive disorder and received treatment with either moclobemide, paroxetine, sertraline, or venlafaxine.
All consenting eligible patients who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder completed the Sexual Functioning Questionnaire, version 1 (SFQ) and were assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) prior to and after 8 or 14 weeks of antidepressant therapy. Analyses were carried out to examine the effect of gender, drug type, pretreatment level of sexual dysfunction, and drug response on reported sexual dysfunction.
Compared with women, men experienced a significantly greater level of drug-related impairment in drive/desire (p < .05), whereas there were no statistically significant differences in levels of arousal/orgasm impairment between men and women. The reported impairment in drive/desire items for men ranged from 38% to 50% and from 26% to 32% for women. No differences were found across the 4 antidepressants in men, whereas in women, rates of dysfunction were generally higher with sertraline and paroxetine, but only significantly so in comparison with moclobemide on some measures (p < .03). Rates of sexual dysfunction with venlafaxine tended to fall between those of SSRIs and the RIMA agent. An unexpected relationship was found between favorable drug response and a decreased level of drug-induced sexual dysfunction.
Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction occurs in approximately 30% to 70% of patients who are treated with sertraline or paroxetine. Lower rates are reported with moclobemide and venlafaxine. Clinicians should evaluate the various aspects of sexual dysfunction before and during antidepressant therapy.
A case is reported of permanent sensorimotor distal polyneuropathy combined with sensory hemisymptoms in a middle-aged woman after only 10 g of metronidazole given as 400 mg, three times daily for 9 d. The disability is still permanent after 22 months of observation. No other cause has been found.
