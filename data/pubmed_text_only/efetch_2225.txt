Dacarbazine (DTIC) is a chemotherapy drug which has antitumor activity at standard doses, exhibits a steep dose-response effect in vitro, and is associated with relatively few non-hematologic toxicities. These characteristics suggest a potential role for this drug in bone marrow transplant preparative regimens. To pursue this hypothesis, 16 patients with refractory solid tumors were enrolled in a phase I study of single agent DTIC to determine the dose of DTIC requiring bone marrow reinfusion and to define the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose when given with autologous bone marrow rescue. Pharmacokinetics were evaluated at the 4394 mg/m2 dose level. The marrow requiring dose was 2000 mg/m2 when given as a single intravenous (i.v.) infusion. The extramyeloid dose-limiting toxicity of DTIC was hypotension, with the maximum tolerated dose of DTIC being 3380 mg/m2 when given with bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Other toxicities were transient and tolerable. At 4394 mg/m2 of DTIC, plasma concentrations declined biexponentially with a terminal half-life of 3 hours. The mean clearance was 10.6 L/hr/m2 with a volume of distribution at steady state of 37.5 L/m2 and a mean maximum plasma concentration of 150 mcg/ml. One patient with melanoma developed a partial response of short duration after receiving 2600 mg/m2 of DTIC. Dacarbazine can be significantly dose escalated with an acceptable toxicity profile, when given with BMT. Future trials should focus on the addition of this drug to current BMT preparative regimens used for the treatment of patients with lymphoma.
Epidural test doses containing more than 15 micrograms epinephrine are reliable for the detection of intravascular injection based on the conventional systolic blood pressure (SBP) criterion (positive if > or = 15 mm Hg increase) but not on the heart rate (HR) criterion (positive if > or = 20 bpm increase) in adult patients anesthetized with isoflurane. The present study was designed to test whether isoproterenol could be used as a reliable marker. Thirty adult patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, each of which was anesthetized with 1% end-tidal isoflurane and nitrous oxide after endotracheal intubation. Isoproterenol group (n = 15) was given 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with 3 micrograms isoproterenol intravenously (i.v.) to simulate an i.v. administered test dose. The saline group (n = 15) was identical to the isoproterenol group but received 3 mL of normal saline. HR and arterial blood pressure were measured at 20-s intervals for 4 min after i.v. injection. Mean HR in the isoproterenol group was significantly higher than in the saline group from 40 to 240 s after i.v. test dose with a mean maximum HR increase of 32 +/- 7 bpm (mean +/- SD) occurring at 68 +/- 19 s. All 15 patients in the isoproterenol group developed HR increases > or = 20 bpm (sensitivity 100%). Since HR was essentially unchanged in the saline group, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were all 100%. On the other hand, 12 of 15 patients in the isoproterenol group and none in the saline group exhibited SBP increases > or = 15 mm Hg, resulting in 80% sensitivity and 83% negative predictive value. In the isoproterenol group, however, transient systolic hypotension ( < 80% of the preinjection value) occurred in five patients without untoward clinical sequelae. These results indicate that, based on the peak HR response, the epidural test dose containing 3 micrograms isoproterenol is a reliable marker for intravascular injection in adult patients during isoflurane anesthesia.
Five nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, synthesized from benzo[a]pyrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and chrysene induced dose-dependent transformation of Syrian hamster embryo cells. Benzo[a]pyrene, a known carcinogen, induced transformation while the other parental compounds, which are non-carcinogens, were not effective. The transforming potential of the nitro derivatives varied from compound to compound; on a molar basis, 1,8-dinitropyrene was the most effective nitrated hydrocarbon followed in order by 3-nitrofluoranthene, 1-nitropyrene, 6-nitrochrysene, and 6-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene. The ability to obtain dose-dependent transformation frequencies indicates that hamster cell transformation represents a responsive model for elucidating the mechanism of action of nitrated carcinogens. Because of their ubiquitous distribution and their ability to induce morphological transformation in mammalian cells, nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons must be considered as potential carcinogens.
The Coronary AngioPlasty Amlodipine REStenosis Study (CAPARES) is a multicentre, double-blind, placebo controlled restenosis trial investigating the effect of amlodipine on angiographic and clinical endpoints in patients undergoing routine percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for stable angina pectoris. A total of 635 patients were randomized to amlodipine or placebo two weeks before PTCA and were followed for four months after PTCA. There were 451 nonstented patients who completed the study with angiographic follow-up. Quantitative coronary angiography revealed that the loss in minimal luminal diameter from immediately after PTCA to the four-month follow-up was unaffected by amlodipine treatment. However, the incidence of repeat PTCA and composite clinical events were significantly lower in patients treated with amlodipine.
The purpose of this study was to compare the objective response rate, duration of remission, and survival of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) versus those of 5-FU plus levamisole in metastatic colorectal cancer using the same dose and schedule of these agents as in the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and intergroup studies of adjuvant therapy. Patients with no prior history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease were entered on this Hoosier Oncology Group randomized Phase III trial. Patients were stratified by Karnofsky performance status and presence or absence of liver metastases. They were randomized to receive 450 mg/m2 5-FU i.v. for 5 days followed by 15 mg/kg i.v. weekly (arm 1) or the same dose of 5-FU plus levamisole 50 mg p.o. every 8 h for 3 days every 2 weeks (arm 2). The duration of treatment for both arms was 26 weeks. From April 1990 to March 1995, 199 patients were entered. One hundred eighty-two patients, 91 in each arm, were fully evaluable. The response rates were 12% on arm 1 and 13% on arm 2. The median duration of response was 18 weeks on both arms. The median survival was 48 weeks on arm 1 and 41 weeks on arm 2 (P = 0.20). This study failed to show any improvement in survival, response, or duration of remission with the addition of levamisole to 5-FU in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
The effect of the experimental antiepileptic drug zonisamide (1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide, ZNS) on the trigeminal complex of cats was compared with the effect of established antiepileptic drugs. Intravenous administration of 10-40 mg/kg ZNS significantly depresses descending excitatory mechanisms, as well as segmental and descending inhibitory mechanisms, but has only a minor effect on segmental excitatory mechanisms. This spectrum of activity is similar to that of valproate, and suggests that ZNS should also be a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug. In agreement with our experimental observations, it has been found that ZNS is effective against complex partial, generalized tonic clonic, and myoclonic seizures. The antiepileptic profile of ZNS in conventional screening tests resembles that of carbamazepine (CBZ) and phenytoin. However, CBZ exacerbates rather than prevents myoclonic seizures. Our experimental model thus provides a more accurate prediction of ZNS's clinical spectrum of activity. The relationship of these findings to the mechanism of action of antiepileptic drugs is discussed.
Previous studies show that octreotide LAR causes regression of gastric ECL-cell carcinoids, reducing both number and size of tumours. This study examines the molecular mechanisms behind the antiproliferative effect of octreotide on the oxyntic mucosa. Female rats received octreotide LAR for 21 days. Serum gastrin was measured and tissue samples for RNA extraction and histology collected from the oxyntic mucosa. Affymetrix analysis showed regulated genes related to apoptosis and proliferation, and a large group of regulated growth-related transcription factors. Verification by real time qRT-PCR showed a high degree of consistency to the microarray results. Supporting the molecular results, histomorphometry showed significant decreases in the number of gastric glands, cells per gland and length of glands, and a tendency towards increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Thus, octreotide exerts a negative effect on oxyntic mucosal growth, and induces extensive gene expression changes relevant to growth regulation.
To examine the effects of intranasal insulin administration on cognition, function, cerebral glucose metabolism, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease (AD).
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
Clinical research unit of a Veterans Affairs medical center.
The intent-to-treat sample consisted of 104 adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 64) or mild to moderate AD (n = 40). Intervention  Participants received placebo (n = 30), 20 IU of insulin (n = 36), or 40 IU of insulin (n = 38) for 4 months, administered with a nasal drug delivery device (Kurve Technology, Bothell, Washington).
Primary measures consisted of delayed story recall score and the Dementia Severity Rating Scale score, and secondary measures included the Alzheimer Disease's Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) score and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL) scale. A subset of participants underwent lumbar puncture (n = 23) and positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 (n = 40) before and after treatment.
Outcome measures were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of covariance. Treatment with 20 IU of insulin improved delayed memory (P < .05), and both doses of insulin (20 and 40 IU) preserved caregiver-rated functional ability (P < .01). Both insulin doses also preserved general cognition as assessed by the ADAS-cog score for younger participants and functional abilities as assessed by the ADCS-ADL scale for adults with AD (P < .05). Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers did not change for insulin-treated participants as a group, but, in exploratory analyses, changes in memory and function were associated with changes in the Aβ42 level and in the tau protein-to-Aβ42 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid. Placebo-assigned participants showed decreased fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in the parietotemporal, frontal, precuneus, and cuneus regions and insulin-minimized progression. No treatment-related severe adverse events occurred.
These results support longer trials of intranasal insulin therapy for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and patients with AD. Trial Registration  clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00438568.
Information about long-term safety and effectiveness is important for appropriate use of antiarrhythmic drug therapy. We report the results of an open-label, long-term (mean, 15 months) therapy extension for 66 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) or atrial fibrillation (PAF) in whom short-term therapy in 2 controlled studies was deemed beneficial by both patient and investigator. Follow-up was accomplished by clinic visits and telephone calls. Results indicated excellent ongoing tolerance and safety. Only 3 (5%) of 66 patients discontinued therapy due to possible noncardiac adverse effects. Only 5 (7.6%) discontinued therapy due to inadequate clinical response. Only 1 discontinuation was ascribed to a worsening arrhythmia (increased frequency of sustained PAF). In PSVT patients, 75% of months were arrhythmia free; in PAF patients, 64% of months were attack free. No clinically significant laboratory, electrocardiographic, or physical abnormalities were ascribed to flecainide. Thus, the long-term safety and efficacy profile of the drug for treatment of PSVT and PAF is encouraging. This promising clinical experience is relatively small and so should be reinforced by larger patient trials in the future.
The incidence of side effects of two contrast media containing different amounts of sodium (Urografin 76 and Conray 70) is compared in two groups of patients (totalling 133) under-going diagnostic examination by means of a cardiac catheter and selective angiocardiography. The following results were obtained: 1. Transient ischaemic reactions were observed in 4 patients of the Urografin group. Cerebral circulation was temporarily restricted in 2 patients, but there were no sequelae. One patient with a history of repeated cardiac infarction in whom the examination was the last hope with a view to coronary surgery died immediately after the angiocardiography. 2. In the Conray 70 group, ventricular fibrillation occurred 32 times in 22 patients after a total of 155 injections. Protracted asystole was observed in 2 patients. The explanation offered for the divergent findings from the use of the two contrast media is not the different anions--the iodine hosts--, but rather the difference in the amount of sodium contained in the preparations. It is concluded from the studies that contrast media which deviate to any great extent in their sodium content from the physiological range of the blood sodium concentration are unsuitable for angiocardiography.
Buspirone, gepirone and ipsaperone administered intraperitoneally (40 mg/kg) to naive rats were found to be proconvulsive for strychnine-induced seizures. The dose of strychnine required to induce seizures in 50% of test animals (CD50) was 2.18 mg/kg in naive rats, while CD50s for rats treated with the azaspirodecanediones ipsaperone, gepirone and buspirone were 1.65, 0.97 and 0.70 mg/kg respectively. Azaspirodecanediones have high affinity for the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor, however, the specific 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) had no effect on strychnine seizure in naive rats (CD50 = 2.0 mg/kg). The strychnine specific proconvulsive effects of inferior olive lesions and buspirone were additive, resulting in a CD50 of 0.1 mg/kg. This observation indicates that the buspirone-induced decrease in strychnine seizure threshold does not require intact inferior olive-climbing fiber pathways. Cerebellar sites for possible azaspirodecanedione action are discussed.
Two major metabolic systems are usually used to generate ATP: oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the mitochondria and glycolysis. Most types of cells employ OXPHOS for ATP production during normoxia but then shift energy production from OXPHOS to glycolysis when exposed to hypoxia. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is the master transcription factor regulating this metabolic shift. On the other hand, macrophages are unique in making use of glycolysis for ATP generation constitutively even during normoxia. We recently proposed that in macrophages, Mint3/APBA3 inhibits factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) during normoxia, which in turn releases the suppression of HIF-1 activity by FIH-1. To demonstrate the physiological function of APBA3 in macrophages, we established Apba3(-/-) mice. The mutant mice presented no apparent gross phenotype but exhibited significant resistance against LPS-induced septic shock. The level of ATP in macrophages obtained from the mutant mice was reduced to 60% of the level observed in wild type cells, which in turn led to reduced ATP-dependent activities such as glycolysis, cytokine production, and motility. We also generated mutant mice with the Apba3 gene deleted specifically from cells of the myeloid lineage and confirmed that LPS-induced septic shock is mitigated significantly. Thus, we show cell type-specific regulation of energy production by APBA3 in macrophages using genetically manipulated mice. The specific function of APBA3 in macrophages might allow us to develop therapeutics to regulate aberrant macrophage function during infection and diseases.
In a 6-week study of children and adolescents with attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADDH) in which desipramine (DMI) was highly effective and well tolerated, the mean maximal daily oral dose in the DMI-treated patients (N = 31) was 4.6 +/- 0.2 mg/kg. Additional data were obtained for 27 placebo nonresponders given DMI openly for 6 additional weeks following a nearly identical protocol and mean daily doses (total N = 58). Individual serum drug concentration varied widely at a given dose. The overall median serum DMI level was 152 ng/ml and in 6 of 56 cases with assayed serum (DMI), the level exceeded 500 ng/ml. Serum tended to be higher with older age and greater clinical improvement. Only small, clinically unimportant but statistically significant increases in diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiographic conduction parameters occurred. DMI-treated patients showed higher incidence during DMI treatment of sinus tachycardia and ECG evidence of intraventricular conduction defect (IVCD) of the right bundle branch block type, with two of these patients developing complete IVCD. Increases in ventricular rate and in ECG conduction parameters, as well as the incidence of IVCD, were higher in patients attaining serum levels of DMI above the median. These findings suggest that, although treatment with DMI at daily doses above 3.5 mg/kg may be needed in some cases of childhood ADDH, such doses require caution and monitoring of serum drug levels and ECG when they are used in the pediatric population.
Cimetidine, a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist, has been demonstrated to have anticancer effects on various types of malignancies. However, the mechanisms of its action on gastric cancer are not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate its antitumor effect and underlying mechanisms in human gastric cancer SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells. The MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability, and flow cytometry, acridine orange staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect apoptosis, for cultured cells. The protein expression in cells was evaluated by Western blot analysis and colorimetric assay. Gastric tumors were established by subcutaneous injection of SGC-7901 cells in nude BALB/c mice, and cimetidine was administered to the mice. The size of tumors was monitored and the weight of tumors was examined. The exposure of gastric cancer cells to cimetidine resulted in growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Activation of the caspase cascade for both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways were demonstrated in vitro, including caspase-8, -9 and -3. We also found that the expression of Bcl-2 protein decreased and the expression of Bax protein increased which lead to an increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In mice bearing SGC-7901 xenograft tumors, administration of cimetidine showed a significant decrease of tumor volumes and tumor weight compared with the control. Our results showed that cimetidine exhibited antitumor effects in gastric cancer cells with an induction of apoptosis.
The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of thymoquinone (TQ) on pancreatic insulin levels, tissue antioxidant and lipid peroxidation (LPO) status in streptozotocin (STZ) nicotinamide (NA) induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in experimental rats by a single intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of STZ (45 mg/kg b.w) dissolved in 0.1 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 4.5), 15 min after the i.p administration of NA (110 mg/kg b.w). Diabetic rats exhibited increased blood glucose with significant decrease in plasma insulin levels. The activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the levels of low-molecular weight antioxidants Vitamin C, Vitamin E and reduced glutathione (GSH) were decreased while increases in the levels of lipid peroxidation markers were observed in liver and kidney tissues of diabetic control rats as compared to control rats. In addition, diabetic rats showed an obvious decrease in pancreatic insulin levels. Administration of TQ (80 mg/kg b.w) to diabetic rats for 45 days significantly reversed the damage associated with diabetes. Biochemical findings were supported by histological studies. These results indicated that TQ exerts a protective action on pancreatic beta cell function and overcomes oxidative stress through its antioxidant properties.
The purpose of the present study was to examine the antioxidant activity of two typical oils obtained from two vegetables, bitter gourd seed and snake gourd seed, containing two different isomers of conjugated linolenic acid (CLnA) against oxidative stress induced by sodium arsenite in relation to tissue lipid peroxidation and inflammation. Male albino rats were taken as subject and divided into six groups: Group 1 was control and Group 2 was treated with sodium arsenite (Sa; 10mg/Kg BW); Groups 3-6 were orally treated with different doses of seed oils maintaining definite concentration of CLnA isomers (0.5% and 1.0% of total lipid for each CLnA isomer) along with sodium arsenite. There was significant increase in lipid peroxidation, pro-oxidant enzyme activity and decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity in brain due to Sa administration. Decrease in total protein content was also observed in plasma, liver and brain of Sa treated group. Significant decrease in phospholipid content and increase in total lipid content and cholesterol content were observed in arsenite treated group. There was significant increase in relative organ weight of liver due to Sa administration. Fatty acid profile of liver and brain lipid shows significant (P<0.05) reduction in most of the polyunsaturated fatty acids and increase in arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) (75.23%) due to inflammation after arsenite treatment. Administration of experimental oils made almost complete restoration of those altered parameters. Overall, these two oils were effective in protecting tissue lipid profiles which were altered due to oxidative stress.
Cocaine is a potent stimulant drug, but its stimulant effects can be substantially modulated by environmental novelty versus familiarity. In this report, we varied exposures to a novel environment as a way to assess the impact of environmental familiarity versus novelty upon the locomotor activation induced by acute and chronic cocaine treatments. In experiment 1, the effects of 1 (PE1) versus 0 (PE0) pre-exposures to the test environment were compared for their impact upon the locomotor stimulant, central zone entry and grooming effects induced by an acute cocaine (10 mg/kg) treatment. In experiment 2, the effects of 10 (PE10) versus 0 (PE0) pre-exposures upon the cocaine effects were compared. Experiment 3 assessed the effects of nine cocaine treatments (10.0 mg/kg) initiated in a novel environment (PE0) versus familiar environment (PE10). In all experiments, cocaine had a potent locomotor stimulant effect in a novel environment, which was attenuated by environmental familiarity such that in PE10 groups, cocaine did not reliably induce an acute locomotor stimulant effect. Environmental novelty/familiarity, however, did not reliably alter cocaine effects upon central zone penetration, grooming behavior, or the neurochemical effects induced by cocaine. In the chronic treatment regimen, the PE0 group exhibited a tolerance-like decrease in locomotor activation, but the PE10 group exhibited a sensitization-like increase in locomotor activation. Despite the marked directional changes in the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine treatments, initiated in a novel (PE0) versus familiar (PE10) environment, the same asymptotic levels of locomotor activation were achieved. In contrast, the behavioral measures of central zone activity progressively increased with repeated treatments regardless of whether the environment was initially novel (PE0) or familiar (PE10). Thus, habituation factors can profoundly alter the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine and can induce pseudo-tolerance phenomena. In contrast, central zone activity undergoes sensitization-like effects independent of habituation state and therefore appears to represent a more fundamental behavioral effect of cocaine. In that, central zone penetration in an open-field is linked to emotional processes; this finding is of substantial importance in understanding the effects of repeated cocaine usage.
Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has generally been reported in adults who had renal impairment or in patients with AIDS using high dose TMP-SMX. We present a 5 month-old infant with immunodeficiency due to major histocompatibility complex class II expression defect, developing hypoglycemic convulsion on the third day of high dose TMP-SMX administration. High insulin and C-peptide levels were documented at the time of hypoglycemia. To overcome hypoglycemia while TMP-SMX tapered off, diazoxide was administered which resolved hypoglycemia in 2 months.
This study compares the risk of acute myocardial infarction among patients exposed to etodolac, naproxen, celecoxib, and rofecoxib.
A retrospective cohort study in 38 258 veteran patients (26 376 patient-years) measured the adjusted odds ratios of acute myocardial infarction during exposure to etodolac, naproxen, celecoxib, or rofecoxib.
Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was confirmed in 100 patients who were exposed to a study nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Compared to naproxen, the increased risk of acute myocardial infarction was not significant for etodolac (OR = 1.32, P = .27), whereas celecoxib (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.09-4.35, P = .03) and rofecoxib (OR = 2.16, 95 CI 1.04-4.46, P = .04) were significant. A post hoc analysis indicates that patients with a prior history of acute myocardial infarction had a significant, 4.26-fold risk for another acute myocardial infarction if taking celecoxib or rofecoxib.
Etodolac is not associated with a statistically increased risk of acute myocardial infarction compared to naproxen.
Ibuprofen, initially at a dose of 200 mg, is a second-line option for treating migraine attacks after paracetamol fails.
Recent research on genetically modified mice has attributed the amnesic effect of benzodiazepines mainly to the alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptor subtypes. The pharmacological approach, using subtype selective ligands, is needed to complement genetic studies. We tested the effects of the non-selective antagonist flumazenil (0-20.0 mg/kg), the preferential alpha1-subunit selective antagonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt) (0-30.0 mg/kg), the non-selective agonist midazolam (0-2.0 mg/kg), the preferential alpha1-subunit selective agonist zolpidem (0-3.0 mg/kg), and the non-selective inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) (0-2.0 mg/kg) in the one-trial step-through passive avoidance task in rats. The compounds were administered intraperitoneally, before the acquisition test. Flumazenil and beta-CCt did not affect retention performance. Midazolam and zolpidem induced amnesia in a dose-dependent manner. The complete reversal of amnesia was unattainable. The effects of zolpidem were significantly attenuated by the both, flumazenil (10.0 mg/kg) and beta-CCt (30.0 mg/kg); by contrast, only flumazenil was considerably effective when combined with midazolam. DMCM exerted promnesic effects at 0.2mg/kg, in an inverted U-shape manner. Both antagonists tended to abolish this action. The results indicate that some other alpha-subunit(s), in addition to the alpha1-subunit, contribute to the amnesic actions of non-selective benzodiazepine site agonists in the passive avoidance task. On the other hand, a significant part of the DMCM-induced promnesic effect could involve the alpha1-subunit and/or other putative beta-CCt-sensitive binding site(s).
