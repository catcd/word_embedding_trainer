To compare the proportion of patients who prefer rizatriptan orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) 10-mg to sumatriptan 50-mg tablet.
Migraineurs express treatment preference based on a variety of attributes including the speed of pain relief and medication formulation. Rizatriptan ODT is an orally disintegrating formulation of rizatriptan, a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist. This study was conducted to determine patient preference between rizatriptan ODT 10-mg and sumatriptan 50-mg tablet for the acute treatment of migraine.
This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study conducted in the United States with 524 enrolled patients. Patients treated a single moderate or severe headache in each treatment period. Patients treated one migraine with either rizatriptan ODT 10-mg or sumatriptan 50-mg tablet, then treated a second migraine with the alternate therapy. Patients completed diary assessments at baseline, and 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes postdose and rated headache severity on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). At the final study visit following treatment of their second migraine, patients expressed preference for one of the two study medications by completing an interviewer-administered Global Preference Question and then responded to a self-administered series of questions to capture their most important reason for preferring one study medication over the other. Safety measurements were recorded through standard adverse experience reporting.
Three hundred eighty-six patients treated two migraine attacks. For those patients who expressed a preference for either rizatriptan ODT or sumatriptan (n = 374), the percentage of patients who preferred rizatriptan ODT 10-mg (57%, n = 213) was significantly greater than those who preferred sumatriptan 50-mg tablet (43%, n = 161) (P<.01). For those patients who treated two migraine attacks and had drug severity measures for both attacks (n = 384), a significantly greater percentage of patients reported pain relief after taking rizatriptan ODT than sumatriptan at the 45- and 60-minute time points (38% versus 29% and 58% versus 49%, respectively) (P<.01). In addition, a significantly greater percentage of patients taking rizatriptan ODT reported a pain-free status at the 60- and 120-minute time points (23% versus 17% [P<.05] and 60% versus 52% [P<.01], respectively). Both rizatriptan ODT and sumatriptan were well tolerated.
A significantly greater proportion of patients preferred rizatriptan ODT 10-mg to sumatriptan 50-mg tablet for the acute treatment of migraine. Efficacy and safety data are consistent with the preference findings.
Introduction. Infective endocarditis in the left heart may be complicated by stroke, due to embolisation from infectious valvular vegetations. Infarction of both occipital lobes, which are supplied by the posterior cerebral arteries, is infrequent, and is the cause of cortical blindness from lesion of the visual cortex. Cortical blindness is characterized by intact pupillary reflexes, a normal fundoscopy, and, rarely, denial of visual loss. Case Presentation. We report the case of a 58-year-old woman, recipient of a mechanical aortic valve, who presented with fever, multiple organ dysfunction, and cortical blindness. Transesophageal echocardiography and blood cultures confirmed the diagnosis of infective endocarditis caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Computed tomography of the brain without contrast revealed the presence of infarctions in both occipital lobes. It is noteworthy that the visual loss resolved after treatment of endocarditis. Conclusions. A stroke occurring in a patient presenting with fever and a history of valvular heart disease strongly suggests the presence of infective endocarditis. Bilateral thromboembolic infarcts of the occipital lobes cause cortical blindness, that can resolve after treatment of endocarditis.
Pathophysiological alterations in the endothelial phenotype result in endothelial dysfunction. Flow cessation, occurring during organ procurement for transplantation, triggers the endothelial dysfunction characteristic of ischemia/reperfusion injury, partly due to a reduction in the expression of the vasoprotective transcription factor Kruppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2). We aimed at (1) characterizing the effects of flow cessation and cold storage on hepatic endothelial phenotype, and (2) ascertaining if the consequences of cold stasis on the hepatic endothelium can be pharmacologically modulated, improving liver graft function. Expression of KLF2 and its vasoprotective programs was determined in (i) hepatic endothelial cells (HEC) incubated under cold storage conditions with or without the KLF2-inducer simvastatin, and (ii) rat livers not cold stored or preserved in cold University of Wisconsin solution (UWS) supplemented with simvastatin or its vehicle. In addition, upon warm reperfusion hepatic vascular resistance, endothelial function, nitric oxide vasodilator pathway, apoptosis, inflammation, and liver injury were evaluated in not cold stored livers or livers preserved in cold UWS supplemented with simvastatin or vehicle. Expression of KLF2 and its vasoprotective programs decrease in HEC incubated under cold storage conditions. Cold-stored rat livers exhibit a time-dependent decrease in KLF2 and its target genes, liver injury, increased hepatic vascular resistance, and endothelial dysfunction. The addition of simvastatin to the storage solution, maintained KLF2-dependent vasoprotective programs, prevented liver damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress and improved endothelial dysfunction.
Our results provide a rationale to evaluate the beneficial effects of a vasoprotective preservation solution on human liver procurement for transplantation.
We studied effects of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) treatment in rats following reserpine treatment or unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injections into medial forebrain bundle. Quantitative in situ hybridization for mRNA's coding for the zinc finger immediate early gene (IEG) zif/268 or Jun family IEG jun b revealed that single L-DOPA injections accentuated IEG expression 3- to 7-fold in the dopamine (DA)-depleted striatum. This increased IEG response did not derive from any alterations in DA receptor-G protein coupling, assayed by DA stimulation of 35S-guanosine-5' (gamma-thio) triphosphate (35S-GTP-gamma-S) binding to striatal sections. Reserpine treatment increased both basal and maximal striatal DA-stimulated 35S-GTP-gamma-S binding. The augmented IEG responses to single L-DOPA treatments involved dependency on both D1 and D2 receptors and acutely to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels. Repetitive L-DOPA treatments yielded persistently elevated (zif/268) or additionally up-regulated (jun b) IEG response in the denervated striatum and down-regulated IEG responses in the control striatum. Degraded L-DOPA responses and appearance of involuntary movements after chronic L-DOPA use in advanced Parkinson's disease may derive from these IEG changes.
This paper presents a review on the pathological effects caused by acute or chronic exposure to the inhalation anesthetics halothane, methoxyflurane, or enflurane. Methoxyflurane has a dose-related nephrotoxicity due to its metabolic degradation with release of fluoride ions whereas suggested pathological renal effects of halothane or enflurane are still under discussion. As to the syndrome of halothane- (or enflurane-, methoxyflurane-) associated hepatitis no dose-dependent hepatotoxicity has been proven but interactions with hypoxia, hypotension, drug-pretreatment, and perhaps genetic abnormalities should be kept in mind. Severe hematologic alterations are effected by prolonged exposure to N2O or halothane and alterations of tumor immunity caused by anesthetic agents are reported, too. From clinical studies and observations of pregnant animals, a correlation between the incidence of miscarriages or malformations and chronic exposure to low doses of inhalation agents may be stated. Nevertheless, an inhalation agent is easy to control because it can be eliminated quickly in the case of complications. Therefore, one would not like to miss these inhalation agents in clinical practice but the immission into the operating room should be limited. Moreover, the best way to keep the operating room clean from waste anesthetic gases is the installation of a scavenging system which is connected to suction.
Organochlorine compounds have been linked to increased risk of several cancers. Despite reductions in their use and fugitive release, they remain one of the most important groups of persistent pollutants to which humans are exposed, primarily through dietary intake. We designed a case-control study to assess the risk of colorectal cancer with exposure to these chemicals, and their potential interactions with genetic alterations in the tumors. A subsample of cases (n = 132) and hospital controls (n = 76) was selected from a larger case-control study in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. We measured concentrations in serum of several organochlorines by gas chromatography. We assessed point mutations in K-ras and p53 genes in tissue samples by polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism and assessed expression of p53 protein by immunohistochemical methods. An elevated risk of colorectal cancer was associated with higher serum concentrations of mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners 28 and 118. The odds ratio for these mono-ortho PCBs for middle and higher tertile were, respectively, 1.82 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90-3.70] and 2.94 (95% CI, 1.39-6.20). Alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorobenzene, and p,p'-DDE (4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethene) showed nonsignificant increases in risk. Risk associated with mono-ortho PCBs was slightly higher for tumors with mutations in the p53 gene but was not modified by mutations in K-ras. Mono-ortho PCBs were further associated with transversion-type mutations in both genes. These results generate the hypothesis that exposure to mono-ortho PCBs contributes to human colorectal cancer development. The trend and magnitude of the association, as well as the observation of a molecular fingerprint in tumors, raise the possibility that this finding may be causal.
Anginal patients who remain symptomatic despite optimally dosed beta blockade may also be given dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. This treatment regimen was examined in a double-blind parallel, randomized, controlled study in 147 patients with angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal beta blockade with atenolol (heart rate at rest <60 beats/min). Patients were randomized to atenolol and/or placebo (control), and atenolol and/or amlodipine. The main outcome measurement was exercise tolerance after 8 weeks compared with baseline. After 8 weeks, no significant differences in time to 0.1-mV ST-segment depression, time to chest pain, and time to end of exercise were observed. The number of patients with chest pain during exercise decreased significantly in the amlodipine group (p = 0.04 vs controls). The subgroup of patients with an early (<6 minutes) onset of chest pain at baseline showed a significant increase in time to chest pain after amlodipine (p = 0.0001 vs controls). In the amlodipine group, ST depression and rate-pressure product at submaximum comparable workload decreased to 0.4 mm (0.56) (p = 0.03 vs controls) and 1.223 (2.652) beats/ min x mm Hg (p = 0.01 vs controls). The number of patients in each group with adverse events was not different. The addition of amlodipine to the treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia, despite optimal beta blockade, is well tolerated and may lead to improvement in symptomatic anginal patients, who have a rapid onset of exercise-induced ischemia.
To study the protective effect of Tongxinluo capsule (TXLC) on myocardial injury induced by isoproternol.
Myocardial injury was induced in 34 rats by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg). The experimental animals were randomly divided into the control group, isoproterenol group and TXLC group. The histopathological change of myocardia was investigated by HE staining, the myocardial cell apoptosis were observed by TUNEL method and the ultrastructure of myocardial cell examined by electron microscope.
No cell degeneration and necrosis, only very few cells of apoptosis positive were found in the control group. While in the isoproterenol group, marked necrosis of myocardial tissue and increase of apoptosis cells were found, and characteristic changes of cell apoptosis were observed under electron microscope. After TXLC treatment, the myocardial necrosis and cell apoptosis were markedly alleviated.
Isoproterenol could induce myocardial necrosis and apoptosis, TXLC could alleviate the myocardial injury through preventing myocardial cell necrosis and apoptosis.
A 59-year-old man developed a nephrotic syndrome and mild renal failure after treatment with phenylbutazone. Light microscope examination of a renal biopsy specimen showed minimal glomerular alterations, and electron microscopy showed diffuse fusion of epithelial cell foot processes without immune deposits. The interstitium revealed focal lymphocyte infiltrates identified as activated T-cells by immune histologic differentiation. The unusual combination of nephrotic syndrome with acute interstitial nephritis is a rare adverse reaction of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID). A disordered cell-mediated immunity could lead to interstitial infiltration of T-lymphocytes which, releasing lymphokines and a vascular permeability factor, cause the glomerular proteinuria. In addition, NSAID inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may enhance production of these lymphocyte-derived substances. Since the nephrotic syndrome persisted 5 months after withdrawal of phenylbutazone, steroid therapy was initiated and 2 months later the renal insufficiency and proteinuria were resolved.
Heightened activity of the AKT signaling pathway is prominent in malignant gliomas and has been suggested to play a role in treatment resistance. Selective targeting of AKT, therefore, may increase chemosensitivity. Recently, a novel class of AKT-selective inhibitors has been described, including SH-6, a phosphatidylinositol analogue.
The effects of SH-6 on AKT signaling were tested in glioma cells, and the putative role of AKT signaling in chemoresistance was tested by attenuating AKT signaling pharmacologically and genetically. The initial characterization of SH-6 included treatment of glioma cells with increasing doses of SH-6 (0.30-30 microM) and examining the effects on AKT signaling proteins by Western blot analyses and in kinase assays with immunoprecipitated AKT1. Dose-response studies with SH-6 administered to glioma cell lines were performed using a luminescent cell-viability assay (0.1-30 microM). Studies examining the effect of carmustine, either alone or in combination with either the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or SH-6, were performed by cell viability assays and clonogenic survival assays. The effect of carmustine on AKT activity as a response to treatment also was examined. Caspase assays were used to examine the potential role of apoptosis in SH-6/ carmustine -elicited cell death. Finally, the induction of a dominant-negative AKT1 transgene was used in combination with carmustine to demonstrate the role of AKT1 in carmustine chemoresistance.
Serum-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT1 was inhibited by SH-6 at doses > or =10 microM (>70% decrease in Threonine 308 and Serine 473 phosphorylation of AKT1). In adenosine triphosphate assays, 72 hours of treatment with SH-6 led to 50% lethal doses near 10 microM for 2 cell lines tested. SH-6 enhancement of carmustine-mediated cell death led to synergistic increases in Caspase 3/Capsase 7 activity, implicating apoptosis as the cell death mechanism. In clonogenic assays, SH-6 cotreatment with carmustine significantly decreased the number of colonies at 10 microM (P < .05) compared with carmustine alone. No decrease was observed in cells that were treated with SH-6 alone (10 microM). LY294002 (10 microM) was also able to enhance the effects of carmustine significantly in both cell lines.
In the current study, the authors characterized the efficacy of a new class of adjuvant chemotherapeutics that show promise in enhancing the efficacy of standard chemotherapy regimens in gliomas.
Indomethacin, an NSAID capable of inhibiting the effect of both cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase, has been reported to repress the growth of breast cancer, skin cancer and head & neck cancer, etc. Inhibition in the some cell lines of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has also been reported. The purpose of this study was primarily to explore the cellular response of human OSCC lines after indomethacin or retinoic acid (RA) treatment and its correlation to apoptosis phenomenon.
Five human OSCC cell lines--KB, SCC15, SCC25, OEC-M1 and OC2--were used for this in vitro study. By direct cell number counting, the cellular response was observed under incremental indomethacin concentrations of 50 microM, 100 microM, 200 microM and 400 microM, in order to select the most appropriate concentration for further study. Then 200 microM indomethacin and all-trans RA at 1 microM were used in the 2nd experiment to explore the intensity of their inhibitory effects individually and potential synergistic inhibition when exerted together. While in the 3rd part, TdT-mediated-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method was used for in situ apoptosis assay to see if the apoptosis rate varied with these two agents.
All 5 cell lines constantly showed growth suppression with positive dosage effect of indomethacin. Synergistic inhibition by combined treatment of indomethacin and RA was seen in RA responsive lines of SCC15 and SCC25, whereas other RA-resistant clones showed no synergism of this combined treatment. The in situ detection of apoptosis by TUNEL assay revealed a significantly higher ratio of apoptotic cells in the indomethacin/RA treated SCC15 and SCC25 than in controls.
The study provides the value of further exploration on the mechanism of how indomethacin inhibiting cancer cell growth and how RA-sensitive OSCC cell lines are synergistically suppressed by conjoint treatment of RA and indomethacin. This study also highlights the value to see how the apoptotic pathway responds differently to the indomethacin/RA treatment.
To determine whether the use of oral antithrombotic agents before the onset of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) affects hematoma features and early patient outcome.
A retrospective, multicenter study involving 1,006 consecutive Japanese patients (607 men, 67 +/- 12 years of age) hospitalized within 24 h after the onset of nontraumatic ICH was conducted.
One hundred and eighty patients were taking oral antiplatelet agents (17.9%, AP group), 67 were taking warfarin (6.7%, W group), and 21 were taking both (2.1%, W + AP group). After adjustment for age, sex, and known confounders, the taking of each kind of antithrombotic therapy was independently related to cerebellar hemorrhage; the odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI, with patients taking no antithrombotic agents as the reference group, were 2.31 (1.23-4.32) for the AP group, 2.90 (1.26-6.63) for the W group, and 3.43 (1.02-11.59) for the W + AP group. Similarly, the taking of each kind of antithrombotic therapy was independently related to hematoma enlargement within the initial 24 h (OR and 95% CI: AP group, 1.92, 1.10-3.34; W group, 4.80, 2.12-10.87; W + AP group, 4.94, 1.31-18.61) and mortality at 3 weeks post-ICH (OR and 95% CI: AP group, 2.70, 1.56-4.68; W group, 2.50, 1.05-5.96; W + AP group, 9.41, 2.78-31.88).
Prior medication with antiplatelet agents, warfarin, or both was predictive of cerebellar hemorrhage, hematoma enlargement, and early death in Japanese ICH patients.
We report a patient with a parkinsonian syndrome induced by sertraline (Zoloft), an SSRI antidepressant, whose symptoms resolved after the drug was discontinued. This case prompted us to investigate the effect of sertraline on dopamine metabolism in animals. Sertraline (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or placebo (vehicle) was administered to two groups of six normal, anesthetized rats and using cerebral microdyalisis extracellular striatal levels of dopamine, the dopamine metabolites (HVA and DOPAC), as well as the serotonin metabolite 5-HIIA were monitored. In animals pre-treated with sertraline, DOPAC, HVA, and 5-HIAA levels were significantly decreased compared to control animals (p < 0.01). These data indicate that sertraline has an effect on dopamine metabolism, which may alter function in the striatum and induce a parkinsonian syndrome.
A great variety of drugs is reported to induce gallbladder disease by various pathogenetic mechanisms. Early epidemiological studies indicated a doubled risk of gallbladder disease in women taking oral contraceptives. More recent studies, however, have failed to confirm those findings; these conflicting results might be explained by the different methods used to define gallbladder disease. It was shown that the lithogenic index of the bile is increased during intake of oral contraceptives. Estrogens cause hypersecretion of cholesterol in bile, due to increase in lipoprotein uptake by the hepatocyte. Progesterone inhibits acyl coenzyme A-cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) activity, causing delayed conversion of cholesterol to cholesterol esters. Of the lipid lowering drugs, only clofibrate has been shown to increase the risk for gallstone formation. The other fibric acid derivatives have similar properties, but clinical experience is not as extensive. They seem to be inhibitors of the ACAT enzyme system, thereby rendering bile more lithogenic. Conflicting epidemiological data exist regarding the induction of acute cholecystitis by thiazide diuretics. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is reported to induce biliary sludge in 25 to 45% of patients, an effect which is reversible after discontinuing the drug. The sludge is occasionally a clinical problem. It was clearly demonstrated that this sludge is caused by precipitation of the calcium salt of ceftriaxone excreted in the bile. Long term use of octreotide is complicated by gallstone formation in approximately 50% of patients after 1 year of therapy, due to gallbladder stasis. Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy by implanted pump is shown to be associated with a very high risk of chemically induced cholecystitis. Prophylactic cholecystectomy at the time of pump implantation is therefore advocated. Some drugs, such as erythromcyin or ampicillin, are reported to cause hypersensitivity-induced cholecystitis. Furthermore, there are reports on the influence of cyclosporin, dapsone, anticoagulant treatment, and narcotic and anticholinergic medication in causing gallbladder disease.
Potassium bromate (KBrO3), a food additive, induces renal-cell tumors in rats. KBrO3 induced 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) formation in human leukemia cell line HL-60 as well as in its H2O2-resistant clone, HP100, suggesting no involvement of H2O2. Depletion of GSH by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) had a little inhibitory effect on KBrO3-induced 8-oxodG formation. However, the amount of 8-oxodG was still significantly higher than that in control, suggesting that intracellular Cys can affect KBrO3 to oxidize DNA, when GSH decreased. KBrO3 caused 8-oxodG in isolated DNA in the presence of GSH (tripeptide; gamma-GluCysGly), gamma-GluCys, CysGly, or Cys. Methional completely inhibited 8-oxodG formation induced by KBrO3 plus GSH, but typical hydroxyl radical scavengers, SOD and catalase, had little or no inhibitory effects. When bromine solution (BrO(-)) was used instead of BrO3(-), similar scavenger effects were observed. Experiments with 32P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the human p53 tumor suppressor gene and the c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene suggested that KBrO3 induced 8-oxodG formation at 5'-site guanine of GG and GGG sequences of double-stranded DNA in the presence of GSH and that treatment of formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase led to chain cleavages at the guanine residues. ESR spin-trapping studies showed that 1:2:2:1 quartet DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) spectrum similar to DMPO/hydroxy radical (*OH) adduct, but the signals were not inhibited by ethanol. Therefore, the signal seemed not to be due to *OH but byproduct due to oxidation of DMPO by the reactive species. The signals were suppressed by the addition of dGMP, but not by other mononucleotides, suggesting the specific reactivity with guanine. On the basis of our results and previous literature, it is speculated that reduction of KBrO3 by SH compounds in renal proximal tubular cells yields bromine oxides and bromine radicals, which are the reactive species that cause guanine oxidation, leading to renal carcinogenesis of KBrO3.
Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity remains a common clinical problem and is the major cause of acute toxic renal failure in hospitalized patients. In recent studies, calcium channel blockers gave controversial results in the prevention of acute ischemic or toxic renal failure. The aims of the study were (i) to describe a rabbit model of mild renal failure (50% reduction in glomerular filtration rate with a mean value of 1.78 +/- 0.46 ml/kg/min) induced by netilmicin given intramuscularly at 20 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h for 5 days, (ii) to investigate the protective effect of diltiazem given at a therapeutic dose (1 mg/kg given intramuscularly every 8 h for 5 days), and (iii) to investigate the mechanisms of this protection through evaluation of function tests, optic histology, and glomerular morphometry. Animals treated with netilmicin and diltiazem exhibited an unchanged glomerular filtration rate compared with controls (3.39 +/- 0.58 versus 3.68 +/- 0.78 ml/kg/min, respectively). This protective effect was not associated with any change in systemic or renal hemodynamics (i.e., no change in renal plasma flow) or changes in the pharmacokinetics of netilmicin, as assessed by fractional excretion and cortical uptake. Netilmicin-induced tubular toxicity was unchanged by diltiazem. Our results suggest that (i) netilmicin exhibits a toxic effect at both the glomerular and the tubular levels, (ii) diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, when given at low therapeutic doses, is able to prevent the aminoglycoside-induced renal failure through a potential glomerular mechanism. The precise mechanisms of the protection remain to be elucidated. These results deserve clinical evaluation in high-risk patients.
Cachexia is characterized by severe weight loss, including adipose and muscle wasting, and occurs in a large percentage of cancer patients. Insulin resistance contributes to dysregulated metabolism in cachexia and occurs prior to weight loss in mice with colon-26 tumor-induced cachexia. Therefore, we hypothesized that the insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone, would attenuate the loss of adipose and muscle to result in improved outcomes for mice with late-stage cachexia. Male CD2F1 mice were inoculated with colon-26 adenocarcinoma cells or vehicle. Treatments included vehicle, rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg body weight/day) or rosiglitazone plus pair-feeding to food intake of vehicle-treated mice with tumors. Rosiglitazone delayed weight loss onset by 2 d over the 16 d duration of this aggressive tumor model. This finding was associated, in part, with increased food intake. In addition, adipose mass, adipocyte cross-sectional area and inflammation were improved with rosiglitazone. However, at the time of necropsy 16 d after tumor inoculation rosiglitazone had no effect on retention of muscle mass, strength or proteolysis in late-stage cachexia. We did not measure stamina or endurance in this study. In early-stage cachexia, rosiglitazone normalized PDK4 and PPAR-delta mRNA in quadriceps muscle and rescued the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose disappearance in mice with tumors. Rosiglitazone may delay weight loss onset by decreasing tumor-induced markers of metabolic change in early-stage cachexia. These changes predict for modest improvement in adipose, but no improvement in muscle strength in late-stage cachexia.
Some commonly used anorexiants, including methamphetamine and phenylpropanolamine, have been associated with stroke. Because phentermine is an anorexiant with a chemical structure similar to that of amphetamines, similar side effects might be expected.
Two patients using phentermine (one was also using phendimetrazine) developed ischemic cerebrovascular disease. One suffered a cerebral infarct with angiographic evidence of vasculopathy involving multiple vascular beds. The other patient developed headache and a hemisensory disturbance of 7 days' duration.
Phentermine, and possibly phendimetrazine, should be considered an anorexiant and sympathomimetic drug that can be associated with ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
Since 1975, many cases of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) associated cardiotoxicity have been described in the literature. A histopathological study of 5-FU induced cardiotoxicity was performed on 50 Swiss albino rats. Multiple interstitial myocardial hemorrhages, multifocal myofibre necroses, inflammatory reaction, vascular changes, valvulitis and pericarditis have been noted especially in the left heart ventricles of rats under study. The mechanism of 5-FU associated cardiotoxicity is controversial. A probable mechanism has been proposed; it explains the endothelial damage leading to extravasation of the drug containing blood into myocardium resulting in myofibre necroses and inflammatory reaction.
Trichophytic onychomycosis of the feet represents an important and serious medical problem. Until recent years, there was not cure for this unpleasant pathology. It is only at the beginning of the 50s, especially at the onset of the antimycotic systemic therapy that a cure is available offering high rate of clinical and mycological therapy. The purpose of this report is to better inform on the undesirable side-effects of antimycotic agents which are currently so largely disseminated. The case of a young patient is presented who was enjoying good health and who after 6 weeks of starting therapy with terbinafine on a doses of 1 pill of 250 mg a day, to treat a trichophytic onychomycosis in both feet, developed severe symptoms of toxic colostatic hepatitis duly corroborated after pertinent testing. Patient had a full recovery after a few months of having interrupted her therapy, apparently without any sequel. The literature in this regard has been revised and a close monitoring of the hepatic function is recommended prior and during treatment with this drug. The need to continue research to find an ideal antimycotic still not found is also recommended.
We report the clinical and radiologic findings and course of two patients who developed drug-related biliary sclerosis during hepatic artery infusion of floxuridine. If severe and persistent jaundice develops during the course of regional hepatic infusion of floxuridine, and obstructive component in the biliary tree must be suspected and investigated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Regional infusion therapy should be stopped immediately. Surgical treatment of the obstructing lesion is avoided unless cholangitis occurs or jaundice persists for more than 3 months and a surgically correctable lesion exists.
We reviewed the charts of 429 patients with primary brain tumors treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to determine the frequency, clinical characteristics, and provocative factors involved in the development of the shoulder-hand syndrome. Five percent (20/429) of patients developed this syndrome, which was strongly associated with phenobarbital use (p less than 0.0001) and often produced more short-term disability than the brain tumor itself.
Renal calcification is a known complication of Furosemide therapy.
We describe 3 children who were diagnosed with renal calculi, not nephrocalcinosis, following the use of Furosemide for 4 weeks. All the infants (24, 18, and 8 months) had successful repair/palliation of congenital heart disease. The dose of Furosemide was 1-2 mg/kg/day and the duration between starting treatment and development of hematuria was 4 weeks.
In all 3 patients renal ultrasound confirmed the presence of renal calculi with no nephrocalcinosis. On follow-up, hematuria improved after 3-4 months.
Renal calculi can complicate short-term Furosemide treatment in children after repair of congenital heart disease. Patients on Furosemide should be closely monitored by urine analysis and/or urine calcium/creatinine ratio for early detection of this complication.
A total of 240 outbred Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 3 different doses of the cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil (CMF) regimen adopted from clinical chemotherapy studies in breast cancer patients. Eighty untreated rats served as controls. Individual and total doses of the drugs applied were lower than corresponding doses used in human adjuvant therapy protocols compared on a mg/m2 basis. Lifelong observation of the animals demonstrated a strong dose-related carcinogenic response to the tested scheme. Main target organs of treatment-related neoplasms were the nervous system, the hematopoietic and lymphatic tissue, the urinary bladder, and the suprarenal gland. It is concluded that the CMF drug combination evokes carcinogenic responses in several organ systems in the rat and should be regarded as representing a carcinogenic risk to humans. Uncritical clinical use of the three-drug protocol should be avoided.
Although many studies have shown that cognitive effect expectancies are associated with drug use and drug treatment outcomes, few studies have compared effect expectancies with drug response following drug challenge. Healthy male and female volunteers (n=19, ages 21-35) who reported using cocaine 1-4 times per month completed the Cocaine Effect Expectancy Questionnaire (CEEQ: [Schafer, J. and Brown, S.A. (1991). Marijuana and cocaine effect expectancies and drug use patterns. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 59, 558-565.]), were challenged with cocaine (0.9 mg/kg, i.n.), then completed a series of visual analog scales (VAS) and the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) at 15 min intervals for 3 h following cocaine administration. Significant positive correlations were found between global negative expectancies and peak responses on the VAS measures "Good," "Happy," "High," "Stimulated," and "Desire to Use Cocaine," and on the LSD subscale of the ARCI post-cocaine administration, and between global positive expectancies and the MBG subscale of the ARCI, and on VAS items "Anxious" and "Good" post-cocaine administration. Global positive expectancies also were positively correlated with peak systolic blood pressure, and global negative expectancies with peak heart rate after cocaine administration. These results suggest that negative and positive effect expectancies both play a complex role in the subjective experience of cocaine effects, and thus likely in the progression of non-use to recreational use, in the transition to abuse, and in individualized treatment strategies.
Thiamphenicol is known to produce two hematological side effects: a decrease in blood cell count concerning mainly red blood cells; in this case regression is observed after withdrawal of the drug; the frequency of this side effect appears to be higher than that observed after chloramphenicol administration. Severe and sometimes fatal pancytopenia is rare and related to primary bone marrow failure; its incidence seems to be increased by high dosages, long-term or repeated administration, interaction with other hematotoxic drug administration, renal failure, elderly or immune suppression.
