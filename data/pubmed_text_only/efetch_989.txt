Anthracyclines cause apoptotic death in many cell types through activation of the ceramide pathway. We tested the hypothesis that doxorubicin induces cardiac myocyte apoptosis through ceramide generation.
Adult rat ventricular myocytes were grown in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, and exposed to 0.5 microM doxorubicin (Dox) for 1 h on the day of cell isolation (day 0). We used the membrane-permeant ceramide analog C2-ceramide (C2-cer) to mimic the effects of endogenous ceramide and PDMP to induce endogenous ceramide accumulation. Apoptosis was assessed upon morphological criteria and DNA fragmentation by the TUNEL method and agarose gel electrophoresis. Ceramide concentration was assessed using the DAG kinase assay.
Myocyte exposure to Dox was associated with cellular and nuclear alterations typical of apoptosis on day 7 but not on day 3. At day 7, the percentage of TUNEL-positive myocytes was markedly increased in Dox-treated cultures compared to control (Cl) cultures (82 +/- 3 vs. 12 +/- 1%, n = 7; p < 0.001); internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was confirmed by the observation of DNA ladders. These alterations were associated with an increase in the intracellular ceramide concentration (1715 +/- 243 vs. 785 +/- 99 pmol/mg prot, n = 5; p < 0.01), a phenomenon also detected on day 3 (731 +/- 59 vs. 259 +/- 37 pmol/mg prot, n = 5; p < 0.001). Incubation of myocytes at day 0 with 50 microM C2-cer induced rapid cell shrinkage and DNA fragmentation (45 +/- 3 vs. 10 +/- 1% TUNEL-positive myocytes on day 1 in C2-cer-treated and Cl cultures, respectively; n = 6, p < 0.001). Myocyte exposure to 10 microM PDMP for 7 days (n = 5), caused ceramide accumulation (1.7-fold increase vs. Cl, p < 0.01), and a marked increase in the percentage of TUNEL-positive myocytes (62 +/- 6 vs. 11 +/- 3% in Cl cultures, p < 0.001). Ventricles of rats injected intraperitoneally with a cumulative dose of 14 mg/kg Dox over a period of 2 weeks also showed an increased ceramide concentration 2 weeks later (11.01 +/- 0.64 vs. 5.24 +/- 0.88 pmol/mg prot, n = 6; p < 0.001).
Our study confirms the existence of a functional ceramide pathway related to apoptosis in cardiac myocytes, and points to its possible involvement in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
In a deceased 39-year-old man with a history of 10-year consumption of heroin and pervitin the authors made histological and immunohistochemical examinations of organs focused on detection of old and recent pathological changes. In the brain they detected oedema, venostasis, inflammatory infiltrates in the wall and surroundings of some vessels and hypoxic changes of neurons with a drop or disappearance of neuron-specific enolase. The myocardium was marked by oedema of the interstitium, focal diminution to disappearance of basophilia of myocyte nuclei with increased eosinophilia of some fibres and smaller and larger foci of fibrosis formed by mature and less mature connective tissue. Immunohistochemical examination revealed focal fibrinogen deposits in myocytes. A surprise was to a certain extent the finding of dispersely distributed caspase-8 in myocytes, caspase being one of the substances signalizing apoptosis. On microscopic examination of the lungs severe haemorrhagic oedema dominated. In the liver they found acute venostasis and chronic inflammatory changes with connective tissue proliferation in the portal areas. The finding in the kidneys suggested acute tubular nephrosis. The authors discuss the problem of direct toxicity of the ingested drugs, the influence of repeated states of hypoxia and infection.
Azathioprine and prednisolone may lead to intolerable long-term side effects in some patients with a renal allograft. We have converted 9 patients with stable grafts but severe side effects from conventional immunosuppression to cyclosporine alone. While the steroid side effects largely resolved and there were no problems with acute rejection associated with conversion, the long-term follow up of these patients has demonstrated a number of problems. The average follow-up period since conversion is now 2 years: 2 patients have died, 2 grafts have been lost, and 1 patient required conversion to azathioprine. Chronic nephrotoxicity, gout, indomethacin-induced acute oliguria, and squamous cell carcinomas were the most troublesome effects seen. The disadvantages of conversion outweigh the advantages in most of the patients that we converted.
Besides targeting the well-known oncogenic c-Met, crizotinib is the first oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibiting anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in clinical trials for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Here, we assessed the possible reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR) by crizotinib in vitro and in vivo.
1-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5- diphenylformazan was used in vitro and xenografts in nude mice were used in vivo to investigate reversal of MDR by crizotinib. To understand the mechanisms for MDR reversal, the alterations of intracellular doxorubicin or rhodamine 123 accumulation, doxorubicin efflux, ABCB1 expression level, ATPase activity of ABCB1 and crizotinib-induced c-Met, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were examined.
Crizotinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents which are also ABCB1 substrates, in MDR cells with no effect found on sensitive cells in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, crizotinib significantly increased intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin and inhibited the drug efflux in ABCB1-overexpressing MDR cells. Further studies showed that crizotinib enhanced the ATPase activity of ABCB1 in a concentration-dependent manner. However, expression of ABCB1 was not affected, and reversal of MDR by crizotinib was not related to the phosphorylation of c-Met, Akt or ERK1/2. Importantly, crizotinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against KBv200 cell xenografts in nude mice.
Crizotinib reversed ABCB1-mediated MDR by inhibiting ABCB1 transport function without affecting ABCB1 expression or blocking the Akt or ERK1/2 pathways. These findings are useful for planning combination chemotherapy of crizotinib with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs.
Dendritic cells are professional antigen-presenting cells associated with efficient antigen processing and presentation to T cells. However, recent evidence also suggests that dendritic cells may mediate direct tumoricidal functions. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which murine dendritic cells mediate the apoptotic death of murine lymphoma cell lines, and whether dendritic cell effector function could be enhanced by preconditioning tumor cells with the protein phosphatase inhibitor nitric oxide (NO) by altering the balance of proapoptotic/antiapoptotic proteins in the treated cells. We observed that NO donor compound sensitized lymphomas to dendritic cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. Both immature and spontaneously matured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (SM-DC) were capable of inducing tumor cell apoptosis, with SM-DCs serving as comparatively better killers. Fas ligand (FasL)-Fas engagement proved important in this activity because elevated expression of membrane-bound FasL was detected on SM-DCs, and dendritic cells derived from FasL-deficient mice were less capable of killing NO-sensitized tumor cells than wild-type dendritic cells. As FasL-deficient dendritic cells were still capable of mediating a residual degree of tumor killing, this suggests that FasL-independent mechanisms of apoptosis are also involved in dendritic cell-mediated tumor killing. Because NO-treated tumor cells displayed a preferential loss of survivin protein expression via a proteasome-dependent pathway, enhanced tumor sensitivity to dendritic cell-mediated killing may be associated with the accelerated turnover of this critical antiapoptotic gene product. Importantly, NO-treated tumor cells were also engulfed more readily than control tumor cells and this resulted in enhanced cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens to specific T cells in vitro.
6-Aminonicotinamide (6-AN) is a niacin antagonist, which leads to degeneration of gray matter astrocytes. Metallothionein 1+2 (MT-1+2) are neuroprotective factors in the central nervous system (CNS), and to determine the roles for MT after 6-AN, we have examined transgenic mice overexpressing MT-1 (TgMTI* mice) after an i.p. injection with 6-AN. In control mice injected with 6-AN, astrocytes in specific gray matter areas of the brainstem showed degeneration. Reactive astrocytes surrounded the degenerated areas, which were heavily infiltrated by macrophages and T lymphocytes. MT-1+2 expression was significantly decreased in the damaged brainstem areas, but it increased in reactive astrocytes surrounding these areas and also in infiltrating macrophages. The levels of oxidative stress, as determined by immunoreactivity for inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitrotyrosine (NITT), and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [TdT]-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate [dUTP]-digoxigenin nick end labeling-positive (TUNEL+), caspase-3+ apoptotic cells were significantly increased in the brainstem of normal mice after 6-AN. In the TgMTI* mice, the 6-AN-induced tissue damage was decreased in comparison to control mice, and they showed significantly reduced numbers of recruited macrophages and T lymphocytes, and a drastic reduction of oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death. In addition, the accompanying reactive astrogliosis was increased in the transgenic mice. To further study the potential protective role of MT, we administered intraperitoneally Zn-MT-2 to 6-AN-injected normal mice and found essentially the same results as those obtained in TgMTI* mice. Thus, we hereby report that endogenous MT-1 overexpression and exogenous MT-2 treatment have significant neuroprotective roles during CNS pathological conditions.
Coenzyme A (CoA) functions in the intracellular trafficking of acetyl groups. In humans, mutations in the pantothenate kinase-2 gene, which encodes a key enzyme in CoA biosynthesis, are associated with neurodegeneration and premature death. Diagnosis is based on iron accumulation in the globus pallidus observed by magnetic resonance imaging. We investigated the elemental composition of the fumble mutant, a model of the human disease. Surprisingly, flies carrying a fumble loss-of-function allele had a three-fold increase in total zinc levels per dry weight when compared to control strains, but no change in total iron, copper or manganese levels. Accordingly, zinc supplementation had an adverse impact on the development of fumble mutant larvae, but zinc chelation failed to protect.
Hypotensive response during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a common complication, lacking the prognostic significance of hypotension during exercise treadmill test.
The present study aimed to assess the possible mechanisms of hypotensive response during DSE and to compare it with exercise treadmill test.
In all, 91 patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent both DSE and exercise treadmill test. Dobutamine-induced hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure drop > or = 20 mmHg from baseline or from the previous level of infusion.
Twenty-one (23%) patients, 10 of whom also had bradycardia, developed hypotension during dobutamine infusion. Five (5.5%) patients were severely symptomatic and the infusion was stopped prematurely, while in the remaining 16 the addition of atropine allowed the continuation of the test. Patients prone to hypotension were predominantly female (p = 0.0004), had smaller (p = 0.01) and better functioning left ventricles (p = 0.0004), were unlikely to have rest wall motion abnormalities (p = 0.0008) or multivessel CAD (p = 0.02), and had less ischemia (wall motion score difference) (p = 0.03). Hypotension during exercise treadmill test was observed in only one (1%) patient with left main disease.
Hypotension during DSE is unrelated to the anatomical or functional extent of CAD and is frequent in the setting of a well-functioning left ventricle. We suppose that vigorous contraction of a small chamber during dobutamine infusion results in an excessive stimulation of cardiac mechanoreceptors that mediate reflex hypotension and bradycardia.
Arsenic is a well-recognized human carcinogen that causes a number of malignant diseases, including lung cancer. Previous studies have indicated that cyclin D1 is frequently over-expressed in many cancer types. It is also known that arsenite exposure enhances cyclin D1 expression, which involves NF-kappaB activation. However, the mechanism between cyclin D1 and the NF-kappaB pathway has not been well studied. This study was designed to characterize the underlying mechanism of induced cell growth and cyclin D1 expression in response to low concentration sodium arsenic (NaAsO(2)) exposure through the NF-kappaB pathway. Cultured human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, were exposed to low concentration sodium arsenite for the indicated durations, and cytotoxicity, gene expression, and protein activity were assessed. To profile the canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB pathways involved in cell growth and cyclin D1 expression induced by low concentration arsenite, the NF-kappaB-specific inhibitor-phenethyl caffeate (CAPE) and NF-kappaB2 mRNA target sequences were used, and cyclin D1 expression in BEAS-2B cells was assessed. Our results demonstrated that exposure to low concentration arsenite enhanced BEAS-2B cells growth and cyclin D1 mRNA and protein expression. Activation and nuclear localization of p52 and Bcl3 in response to low concentration arsenite indicated that the non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway was involved in arsenite-induced cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, we further demonstrated that p52/Bcl3 complex formation enhanced cyclin D1 expression through the cyclin D1 gene promoter via its kappaB site. The up-regulation of cyclin D1 mediated by the p52-Bcl3 complex in response to low concentration arsenite might be important in assessing the health risk of low concentration arsenite and understanding the mechanisms of the harmful effects of arsenite.
Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) catalyzes the metabolic activation of the procarcinogen, N-nitrosodimethylamine, and cytotoxic carbon tetrachloride compounds. A tandem repeat polymorphism in the 5'-flanking region of the CYP2E1 gene was investigated in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients to clarify the relationship between CYP2E1 gene polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility. Blood samples were taken from 236 healthy control subjects (192 males and 44 females) and 111 patients (78 males and 33 females) who underwent surgery for NSCLC in Japan. DNA was isolated from these samples and the 5'-flanking region of the CYP2E1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and examined for tandem repeat polymorphisms using DNA fragment analysis. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of three alleles, A2, A3, and A4 (361, 367, and 457 bp, respectively), with four genotypes observed in the lung cancer group and five genotypes in the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in genotype distribution between the lung adenocarcinoma and control group (P=0.0088, A4/A4 vs. non-A4/A4). In the lung adenocarcinoma group, the univariate risk estimates for the A4/A4 subgroup compared to the most common subgroup (A2/A2) was 4.300 (95% confidence interval = 1.358-13.618, P=0.0131). We conclude that the A4/A4 genotype of the 5'-flanking region of CYP2E1 was significantly more frequent in lung adenocarcinoma cases than in healthy controls and, therefore, may be involved in the development of lung adenocarcinoma.
Adverse pregnancy outcome in diethylstilbestrol-exposed progeny has been described by many authors. These three cases demonstrate many of the features discussed in the literature as well as a previously unreported cause of antepartum and intrapartum bleeding: a cervical vascular malformation.
Selenium (Se) is an essential component of several major metabolic pathways and controls immune function. Arsenic (As) is a human carcinogen with immunotoxic and genotoxic activities, functioning mainly by producing oxidative stress. Due to the ability of Se to interact with As and to possibly block its toxic effects, we investigated the impact of dietary Se-methionine (Se-Met) supplementation on the toxicity of As exposure in vivo in a mouse model. Sufficient and excess levels of Se-Met (0.2 and 2 ppm, respectively) were fed to C57BL/6N female mice exposed to sodium arsenite (3, 6 and 10 mg/kg) in tap water for 9 days. We observed that As exposure increased Se-Met excretion in the urine. Se-Met supplementation increased the relative liver weight and decreased the concentration of total liver proteins in animals exposed to 10 mg/kg of As. Se-Met supplementation maintained a normal pool of glutathione in the liver and increased glutathione peroxidase concentration, although the lipoperoxidation level was increased by Se-Met even without As exposure. Se-Met supplementation helped to maintain the CD4/CD8 ratio of lymphocytes in the spleen, although it increased the proportion of B cells. Se-Met supplementation prior to As exposure increased the secretion of interleukin-4, IL-12 and interferon-γ and the stimulation index of the spleen cells in in vitro assays. Se-Met intake improved the basal immunological parameters but did not reduce the damage caused by oxidative stress after low-dose As exposure.
Opioids are widely used for anesthesia but paradoxically induce postoperative pain hypersensitivity via N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulation. Sevoflurane effects on opioid-induced hyperalgesia have not been yet evaluated in vivo. Nevertheless, some experimental in vitro studies reported anti-NMDA receptor properties for sevoflurane. The aim of this study was to evaluate sevoflurane effects on fentanyl-induced hyperalgesia in opioid-naive rats and in rats with inflammatory pain.
Sevoflurane effects on hyperalgesia were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats: opioid-naive rats, rats treated with fentanyl (4 x 60 microg kg(-1)) and rats with inflammatory pain (carrageenan) treated with fentanyl (4 x 60 microg kg(-1)). On day zero, subcutaneous fentanyl injections were administered and inflammatory pain was induced with one carrageenan injection in one hind paw. Rats were exposed to low concentrations of sevoflurane (1.0 or 1.5%) on day zero prior to fentanyl injections and inflammatory pain induction, and for the duration of the fentanyl analgesic effect. The nociceptive threshold (Randall-Selitto test) was evaluated daily for 7 days. On day seven, naloxone was injected and the nociceptive threshold was assessed 5 min later.
In rats without inflammatory pain but treated with fentanyl on day zero, sevoflurane 1.0% reversed the early (day zero) and long-lasting (day zero to day three) hyperalgesia classically described after high-doses of fentanyl (P < 0.05). This sevoflurane concentration antagonized the hyperalgesia induced by naloxone on day seven (P = 0.33). In a second experiment in rats with inflammatory pain, exposure to low concentrations of sevoflurane (1.0 and 1.5%) did not reduce fentanyl-induced hyperalgesia (P > 0.05), but nevertheless antagonized the naloxone induced hyperalgesia on day seven (P = 0.061).
Relatively low sevoflurane concentrations (1.0%) reverse fentanyl-induced hyperalgesia in rats without inflammatory pain. Nevertheless, the lack of effect of sevoflurane concentrations of 1.0% and 1.5% to oppose hyperalgesia following high-dose fentanyl and inflammatory pain suggests that sevoflurane anti-hyperalgesic properties are weak.
Neuroleptic-induced tardive dystonia is frequently refractory to therapy. We describe a 13-year-old girl with neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis who developed dystonia after beginning treatment with thioridazine for acute psychosis. Although anticholinergic drugs and benzodiazepines were ineffective, the patient improved with baclofen. Patients with certain degenerative diseases of the central nervous system may be at increased risk for the development of drug-induced dystonia, and we caution against the use of neuroleptics in these patients.
High-affinity, slow-onset, long-acting dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitors are being considered as potential agonist replacement therapies for cocaine addiction, and therefore the ability of these drugs to reinstate cocaine seeking and to selectively decrease cocaine-maintained responding should be assessed.
The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate the effects of the active enantiomer of a high-affinity, slow-onset, long-acting DAT inhibitor, (-)2beta-propanoyl-3beta-(4-tolyl)-tropane (PTT), and cocaine on food- and cocaine-maintained responding and on extinguished responding previously maintained by cocaine in non-human primates using a within-subjects design.
Rhesus monkeys (n=3) responded under a multiple fixed-ratio schedule of food (1 g) and drug reinforcement, and cocaine dose-response curves (saline, 0.003-0.3 mg/kg per injection) were determined. The effects of pretreatment with (-)PTT (0.001-0.056 mg/kg, i.v.) and cocaine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) were determined when the dose of cocaine that maintained peak response rates (0.03 mg/kg per injection) or saline was available.
(-)PTT and cocaine reduced cocaine intake; (-)PTT affected cocaine self-administration only at doses that also decreased food-maintained responding. (-)PTT and cocaine reinstated responding that was previously reinforced by cocaine at lower doses than were necessary to decrease cocaine-maintained responding. For all studies, PTT was at least 1.0 log-unit more potent than cocaine. Compared to cocaine, PTT had a longer duration of action in all behavioral measures.
These results suggest that PTT would decrease cocaine use, but only at doses that disrupted other behaviors. It appears that the potency of this class of drugs to reinstate cocaine-seeking is substantially greater than their potency at decreasing cocaine self-administration.
In a retrospective case control study at the University of Frankfurt, Germany, 101 babies born to opiate-addicted mothers were identified from birth charts from 1988 to 1995. After birth, they developed a withdrawal syndrome (neonatal abstinence syndrome). Fifty control infants and their mothers were selected from neonatal wards. The group of opiate-exposed babies was subdivided into a group born to mothers without methadone treatment (n = 48) and a group born to mothers who were enrolled in a methadone program (n = 51). The methadone infants had a significantly higher mean birth weight (2822 g) than children in the group without methadone (2471 g). The abstinence syndrome was much more intense in the methadone group (convulsions 47.1%) than in heroin-exposed babies without methadone treatment (convulsions 27.1%). Women in methadone maintenance programs lived in more stable socioeconomic conditions than opiate-addicted women without methadone substitution. Moreover, they cared significantly better for their babies: 81.3% of the methadone mothers visited their children on a regular basis and 90.9% cared adequately. The data emphasize the need in future research to look more closely at the role of methadone treatment programs in the development of opiate-exposed babies.
We report a rare case of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) induced by 5-FU and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regime). A 35-year-old woman with ileus was diagnosed with sigmoid cancer Stage IV (T4N4M0P2H0), and excision of the sigmoid colon, and left ureteroureteral anastomosis was performed. Postoperative chemotherapy with FOLFOX4 was performed. Complications of hypertension were seen on day 6, and convulsions on day 11 after chemotherapy. Headache and visual disturbance were also complications. MRI of the brain revealed bilateral high signal intensities of posterior lobes on T2 weighted and FLAIR images without enhancement. The patient was treated with antihypertensive therapy and anticonvulsive therapy. Her symptoms entirely disappeared, including the bilateral posterior lesions on MRI after two weeks. This report would suggest that medical oncologists should be aware that multidrug chemotherapies may increase the risk of fatal neurological complications like RPLS.
We examined the outcome of patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) but without traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy.
From February 2002 to March 2008, 82 patients with APL were treated with a combination of ATRA plus ATO. The first cohort of 65 patients received ATRA and ATO (beginning on day 10 of ATRA). High-risk patients (WBCs >or= 10 x 10(9)/L) received GO on the first day. From July 2007, the second cohort of 17 patients received ATRA and ATO concomitantly on day 1. They also received GO on day 1, if high risk, and if their WBC increased to more than 30 x 10(9)/L during induction. Monitoring for PML-RARA fusion gene was conducted after induction and throughout consolidation and follow-up.
Overall, 74 patients achieved complete remission (CR) and one achieved CR without full platelet recovery after the induction, for a response rate of 92%. Seven patients died at a median of 4 days (range, 1 to 24 days) after inclusion in the study from disease-related complications. The median follow-up is 99 weeks (range, 2 to 282 weeks). Among the responding patients, three experienced relapse at 39, 52, and 53 weeks. Three patients died after being in CR for 14, 21, and 71 weeks, all from a second malignancy. The estimated 3-year survival rate is 85%.
The combination of ATRA and ATO (with or without GO) as initial therapy for APL was effective and safe and can substitute chemotherapy-containing regimens.
The MAPHY Study was conducted to investigate whether metoprolol, a relatively beta 1-selective beta-blocker, given as initial antihypertensive treatment, would lower cardiovascular complications of high blood pressure to a greater extent than do thiazide diuretics as initial treatment at similar blood pressure control. In a controlled, randomized, stratified primary prevention study (n = 3234; 16,180 patient-years) in white men (40 to 64 years old) with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension, a treatment schedule starting antihypertensive treatment with metoprolol was compared with treatment starting with a thiazide diuretic. The two treatment groups were well matched in blood pressure and other major clinical characteristics at randomization, as well as at the last follow-up during treatment. Total mortality was significantly lower in patients randomized to metoprolol. At the median follow-up time (4.2 years) 28 deaths occurred in the metoprolol group and 54 in the diuretic group--a difference of 48% in total mortality (95% confidence limit, ranging from 68% to 17%), mainly because of a highly significant reduction in coronary heart disease at this point in time. The benefit demonstrated with metoprolol seems to have important implications for clinical practice and public health policy, since hypertension and coronary heart disease are major health problems worldwide.
Oleuropein (oleu) is a natural phenolic antioxidant, which is present in elevated concentration in olives, olive oil and olive tree leaves. Doxorubicin (DXR) induced cardiotoxicity is mainly induced by oxidative stress but the precise mechanism remains obscure. However, there is evidence that high concentration of nitric oxide (NO) occurring as a result of iNOS induction and peroxynitrite formation may be involved in DXR cardiotoxicity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible protective role of oleu in DXR induced cardiotoxicity in vivo. Fifty rats were divided into 6 groups and treated as follows: control group with a single injection of 2 ml normal saline intraperitoneally (i.p.), DXR group with a single dose of 20 mg/kg i.p, and DXR plus oleu groups with 20 mg/kg DXR i.p. and 100 or 200 mg/kg/BW of oleu i.p. for 5 or 3 consecutive days starting either 2 days before or on the day of DXR administration. Seventy-two hours after DXR treatment blood samples were collected for creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatine phosphokinase-MB (CPK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) assessments and the rats were then sacrificed. Hearts were used for general histology, iNOS immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis, and for determination of tissue concentrations of lipid peroxidation products, protein carbonyls (PCs), and nitrotyrosine (NT). DXR treated animals demonstrated very extensive cytoplasmic vacuolisation whereas much less vacuolisation was found in oleu treated groups. They also revealed a significant elevation of cardiac enzymes release into systemic circulation (P<0.05 vs saline). Both doses of Oleu tested and both treatment protocols reduced DXR elevated serum levels of CPK, CPK-MB, LDH, AST and ALT (P<0.05). Furthermore, it reduced DXR induced lipid peroxidation, PCs content, NT concentration and iNOS induction in myocardial tissue (P<0.05). Oleu exerts a protective effect by eliminating DXR induced cardiotoxicity expressed by the alteration of intracellular and peripheral markers. Combined oleu and DXR treatment improves the therapeutic outcome by preventing undesirable toxicity.
A 7-year-old girl suffered from withdrawal syndrome with systemic convulsion after sedation with midazolam and fentanyl. She had a history of severe accidental alkaline esophagitis, and under went polysurgeries. This time, she was scheduled to receive reconstruction of the esophagus with small intestine in order to resolve esophageal stenosis. Operation and anesthesia lasted for 14 hours, and 17 hours, respectively. In the postoperative period, she was under heavy sedation with midazolam and fentanyl in order to keep neck position immobile. Her sedation persisted for 14 postoperative days, and the total doses of midazolam and fentanyl were more than 100 mg x kg(-1), and 6.4 mg x kg(-1), respectively. Thereafter, her sedation was tapered and discontinued within about 24 hours. After 12 hours, she suddenly developed systemic convulsion with loss of consciousness. There was no evidence of obvious organic central nervous system abnormality. We suspected withdrawal syndrome, and gradual decrease of midazolam and fentanyl prevented her from going into withdrawal syndrome. We have to pay attention to withdrawal syndrome when heavy and long sedation with midazolam and fentanyl was employed and the drugs were then tapered and discontinued.
In addition to its well-characterized role in the regulation of drug metabolism and transport by xenobiotics, pregnane X receptor (PXR) critically impacts on lipid homeostasis. In mice, both ligand-dependent activation and knockout of PXR were previously shown to promote hepatic steatosis. To elucidate the respective pathways in human liver, we generated clones of human hepatoma HepG2 cells exhibiting different PXR protein levels, and analyzed effects of PXR activation and knockdown on steatosis and expression of lipogenic genes. Ligand-dependent activation as well as knockdown of PXR resulted in increased steatosis in HepG2 cells. Activation of PXR induced the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1-dependent lipogenic pathway via PXR-dependent induction of SREBP1a, which was confirmed in primary human hepatocytes. Inhibiting SREBP1 activity by blocking the cleavage-dependent maturation of SREBP1 protein impaired the induction of lipogenic SREBP1 target genes and triglyceride accumulation by PXR activation. On the other hand, PXR knockdown resulted in up-regulation of aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1B10, which enhanced the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)-catalyzed reaction step of de novo lipogenesis. In a cohort of human liver samples histologically classified for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, AKR1B10, SREBP1a and SREBP1 lipogenic target genes proved to be up-regulated in steatohepatitis, while PXR protein was reduced. In summary, our data suggest that activation and knockdown of PXR in human hepatic cells promote de novo lipogenesis and steatosis by induction of the SREBP1 pathway and AKR1B10-mediated increase of ACC activity, respectively, thus providing mechanistic explanations for a putative dual role of PXR in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis.
Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) is a ubiquitous membrane-bound enzyme that cleaves the two N-terminal amino acids from peptides with a proline or alanine residue in the second position from the amino end. Potential substrates for DPP IV include several neuropeptides, suggesting a role for DPP IV in neurological processes. We have developed a potent DPP IV inhibitor (IC50 = 30 nM), 1-(2-amino-3-methyl-butyryl)-azetidine-2-carbonitrile (AMAC), which has shown efficacy in two established models of psychosis: mescaline-induced scratching and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. In the mescaline-induced scratching model, AMAC treatment before mescaline administration reduced the number of scratching paroxysms by 68% (P < 0.01). The compound showed a dose-dependent effect, inhibiting significantly at 6, 20 and 60 mg/kg (37%, 39% and 68%, respectively). In the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity model, 50 and 60 mg/kg AMAC, given before injection of amphetamine, significantly reduced hyper-locomotion by 65% and 76%, respectively. Additionally, AMAC showed no significant activity in binding assays for 20 receptors thought to be involved in the pathology of schizophrenia, including dopamine, serotonin and glutamate. A structurally similar analog, 1-(2-dimethylamino-3-methyl-butyryl)-azetidine-2-carbonitrile (DAMAC), that does not inhibit DPP IV, was inactive in both models. Taken together, these data suggest that the antipsychotic effects of AMAC are the result of DPP IV inhibition.
The effects of indomethacin on A/J mice were investigated. The non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin reduced significantly the number of lung adenomas 3, 4 or 8 months after urethane injection by 28, 30 and 29% respectively. The density of apoptotic cell bodies increased 2.9-fold in the lung adenomas of A/J mice treated with indomethacin. By immunocytochemistry, COX-2 immunoreactivity was present in the cytosol of lung adenomas, and in epithelial cells lining the bronchioli and bronchus as well as type 2 alveolar cells. COX-1 immunostaining was similar to that of COX-2 in the lungs of urethane-injected mice treated with or without indomethacin. By RT-PCR, COX-1 and COX-2 PCR products were present in mouse lung adenomas, alveoli and bronchioli. These results suggest that indomethacin may inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 in the A/J mouse lung resulting in reduced adenoma formation.
The scavenging effect of Chinonin on NO and oxygen free radicals and its protective effect on myocardium from the ischemia-reperfusion injury was studied with electron spin resonance (ESR) and chemiluminescence techniques. Chinonin can effectively inhibit the oxidative activity of ONOO-, (the IC50 = 7 x 10 (-5) mmol/L) and scavenge oxygen free radicals generated from the reaction of xanthine and xanthine oxidase (the IC50 = 2/5 x 10(-4) mmol/l). It is difficult to find another antioxidant which can scavenge so effectively both ONOO- and oxygen free radicals simultaneously. In the system of ischemia-reperfusion injury of myocardium, Chinonin can, in parallel, scavenge the NO and oxygen free radicals generated from the ischemia-reperfused myocardium, and decrease the activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) in the coronary artery effluent of ischemia-reperfused heart and therefore protect the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury. The protective effect of 0.1 mmol/l Chinonin is similar to that of 1500 U/ml SOD and catalase.
Electroconvulsive therapy, which is used to treat refractory major depression in humans increases seizure threshold and decreases seizure duration. Moreover, the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor induced by electroshocks (ECS) might protect hippocampal cells from death in patients suffering from depression. As temporal lobe epilepsy is linked to neuronal damage in the hippocampus, we tested the effect of repeated ECS on subsequent status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine and leading to cell death and temporal epilepsy in the rat. Eleven maximal ECS were applied via ear-clips to adult rats. The last one was applied 2 days before the induction of SE by lithium-pilocarpine. The rats were electroencephalographically recorded to study the SE characteristics. The rats treated with ECS before pilocarpine (ECS-pilo) developed partial limbic (score 2) and propagated seizures (score 5) with a longer latency than the rats that underwent SE alone (sham-pilo). Despite this delay in the initiation and propagation of the seizures, the same number of ECS- and sham-pilo rats developed SE with a similar characteristic pattern. The expression of c-Fos protein was down-regulated by repeated ECS in the amygdala and the cortex. In ECS-pilo rats, c-Fos expression was decreased in the piriform and entorhinal cortex and increased in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Neuronal damage was identical in the forebrain areas of both groups, while it was worsened by ECS treatment in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices compared to sham-pilo rats. Finally, while 11 out of the 12 sham-pilo rats developed spontaneous recurrent seizures after a silent period of 40+/-27 days, only two out of the 10 ECS-pilo rats became epileptic, but after a prolonged latency of 106 and 151 days. One ECS-pilo rat developed electrographic infraclinical seizures and seven did not exhibit any seizures. Thus, the extensive neuronal damage occurring in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices of the ECS-pilo rats seems to prevent the establishment of the hyperexcitable epileptic circuit.
