Anaemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for children in Africa. The plasma protein haptoglobin (Hp) binds avidly to free haemoglobin released following malaria-induced haemolysis. Haptoglobin polymorphisms result in proteins with altered haemoglobin-binding capacity and different antioxidant, iron-recycling, and immune functions. Previous studies examined the importance of haptoglobin polymorphism in malaria and iron homeostasis, but it is unknown whether haptoglobin genotype might be a risk factor for anaemia in children in a malaria-endemic area.
A cohort of 780 rural Gambian children aged 2-6 y was surveyed at the start and end of the malaria season. Samples were taken to assess haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, iron status (ferritin, zinc protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor concentration), haptoglobin concentration, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (a measure of inflammation), and malaria parasites on blood film. We extracted DNA and genotyped for haptoglobin, sickle cell, and glucose-6-phosphate (G6PD) deficiency. Mean Hb levels fell over the malaria season. Children with the haptoglobin 2-2 genotype (17%) had a greater mean drop in Hb level over the malaria season (an 8.9 g/l drop; confidence interval [CI] 5.7, 12.1) compared to other children (a 5.1 g/l drop; CI 3.8, 6.4). In multivariate regression analysis, controlling for baseline Hb level, age group, village, malaria parasites on blood film, iron status, haptoglobin concentration, and G6PD deficiency, haptoglobin genotype predicted Hb level at the end of the malaria season (p = 0.0009, coefficient = -4.2). Iron status was not influenced by haptoglobin genotype.
The finding that haptoglobin 2-2 genotype is a risk factor for anaemia in children in a malaria-endemic area may reflect the reduced ability of the Hp2-2 polymer to scavenge free haemoglobin-iron following malaria-induced haemolysis. The magnitude of the effect of haptoglobin genotype (4 g/l Hb difference, p = 0.0009) was comparable to that of G6PD deficiency or HbAS (3 g/l difference, p = 0.03; and 2 g/l difference, p = 0.68, respectively).
To characterize the clinical diagnostic features, neuropathologic phenotype of tau deposition, and subunit structure of tau filaments in patients who had an asparagine-to-lysine substitution at codon 279 (the N279K missense mutation) of the gene for microtubule-associated tau protein.
The N279K mutation is a causative genetic defect for pallidopontonigral degeneration in an American kindred that presents with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and parkinsonism.
The authors analyzed retrospectively the clinical symptoms of two Japanese brothers who carry this mutation. Postmortem neuropathologic and electron microscopic studies, and Western blot analysis of insoluble tau were performed to correlate tau-mediated lesions with neurologic deficits.
Both patients exhibited impairment in recent memory, parkinsonism, and corticospinal disturbances in addition to FTD. Parkinsonism in one patient was responsive temporarily to l-dopa. There was intense tau deposition in the medial temporal cortices and upper and lower motor neurons with accompanying corticospinal tract degeneration. Two distinct tau isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeats, in hyperphosphorylated forms, were the primary constituents of insoluble tau, which aggregated to the filamentous component, termed "paired tubules," in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. The elemental filaments were hollow tubules measuring 11 to 12 nm in diameter, two of which adhered to each other along their longitudinal axes to form "paired tubules."
Early memory loss and pyramidal signs, which are atypical of FTD, can be presenting symptoms in this disorder. The authors demonstrated that the subunit structure of tau filaments is a pair of hollow tubules despite the prevailing twisted ribbon model.
The present investigation explored the possibility that the commonly observed hypotension that occurs during induction of anesthesia with propofol might be related to its ability to produce venodilation. Thirty-six ASA I and II patients who received no premedication were studied. The first 20 patients were divided into two equal groups. Hemodynamic measurements consisted of heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and forearm venous compliance by occlusive plethysmography. Baseline measurements were made in awake patients while resting in a supine position. Repeat measurements were made during steady-state infusions of propofol (2.5 mg/kg bolus injection, followed by a continuous infusion at 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) or thiopental (4 mg/kg bolus injection, followed by continuous infusion at 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), 10 min after tracheal intubation while patients were artificially ventilated. Both anesthetics resulted in a significant (P less than 0.05) and similar tachycardia; however, propofol produced significant decreases in systolic (-30 +/- 9 mm Hg) and diastolic (-11 +/- 4 mm Hg) arterial blood pressure. Forearm venous compliance was significantly increased during propofol administration but unchanged in patients receiving thiopental. In four additional patients receiving smaller consecutive infusions of propofol (50 and 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), significant subtle increases in forearm compliance were also recorded. These increases were not observed in four patients who received placebo infusions. Thus, one mechanism promoting hypotension during propofol anesthesia in humans seems to be related to its direct effects on venous smooth muscle tone and presumably venous return.
A retrospective, case-controlled analysis comparing patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit with severe exacerbations of asthma who received continuously nebulized albuterol (CNA) versus intermittent albuterol (INA) treatments is reported. Forty matched pairs of patients with asthma are compared. CNA was administered for a mean of 11 +/- 10 hr. The incidence of cardiac dysrhythmias was similar between groups. Symptomatic hypokalemia did not occur. CNA patients had higher heart rates during treatment, which may reflect severity of illness. The incidence of intubation was similar. We conclude that CNA and INA demonstrated similar profiles with regard to safety, morbidity, and mortality.
The aim of this study was to develop a model for predicting clinically significant deterioration in the left ventricular ejection fraction due to chronic doxorubicin administration. Twenty-six patients were monitored during their courses of doxorubicin chemotherapy with serial gated equilibrium radionuclide angiography. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to derived the best combination of clinical and radionuclide angiographic predictors of resting left ventricular ejection fraction at any point during the course of chemotherapy. The final model consisted of five variables: left ventricular ejection fraction at the previous monitoring point; cumulative dose of doxorubicin achieved at the previous monitoring point; increment in dose from the previous monitoring point; age of the patient; and time to peak left ventricular emptying at the previous monitoring point. The cumulative dose, the ejection fraction at the previous monitoring point and the final model, respectively, explained 11%, 33% and 53% of the variability in ejection fraction determinations during the 26 patient courses. The final model also forecast a potentially very low resting left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 35%) at the cumulative doses of doxorubicin which provoked serious clinical cardiotoxicity in two patients. A multivariate model is a useful aid in timing discontinuation of doxorubicin prior to the development of a clinically significant deterioration in left ventricular ejection fraction.
Our laboratory has previously characterized age-dependent changes in nociception upon acute morphine withdrawal. This study characterizes changes in mechanical and thermal nociception following acute, intermittent, or continuous morphine administration in infant (postnatal days 5-8) and young (postnatal days 19-21) rats. Morphine was given as a single acute administration (AM), intermittently twice a day for 3 days (IM), or continuously for 72 h via pump (CM). AM did not produce long-term changes in mechanical or thermal nociception in either infant or young rats. CM produced changes in mechanical nociception that included the development of tolerance, opioid-induced mechanical allodynia and withdrawal-associated mechanical allodynia in young rats, but only tolerance and a prolonged withdrawal-associated mechanical allodynia in infant rats. IM produced withdrawal-associated mechanical allodynia in both infant and young rats. Measuring paw withdrawal responses to thermal stimuli, infant and young rats showed tolerance without opioid-induced thermal hyperalgesia or withdrawal-associated thermal hyperalgesia following CM. In contrast to CM, withdrawal-associated thermal hyperalgesia was seen in both ages following IM. In conclusion, CM versus IM differentially modified mechanical and thermal nociception, suggesting that opioid-dependent thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia can be dissociated from each other in infant and young rats. Furthermore, tolerance, opioid-induced hypersensitivity, and withdrawal-associated hypersensitivity are age-specific and may be mediated by distinct mechanisms.
The primary aims of this study were (i) a replication of the effectiveness and tolerability of risperidone in the treatment of patients with acute mania in a very large cohort in a naturalistic treatment setting and (ii) to extend the data on the effect and tolerability of risperidone in the treatment of patients with acute mania to an Asian population. A total of 909 patients fulfilling DSM-IV criteria of bipolar disorder (current manic and hypomanic episode) entered this large, open, multicentre study. The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SARS) were measured at baseline and weeks 1, 3 and 6, for the assessment of effectiveness and extrapyramidal symptoms. This study showed a statistically significant reduction of scores on the YMRS and CGI-severity (mean change=-23.5+/-11.8, P<0.0001; mean change=-2.7+/-1.5, P<0.0001, respectively) from baseline to endpoint (week 6). The number of patients with a 50% reduction or more in the YMRS and CGI-severity scores was 693 (77.8%) and 630 (70.7%) at endpoint, respectively. There were no statistically significant increments of scores on SARS. Risperidone was generally well tolerated. The present larger open study indicates that risperidone add-on therapy is effective and tolerable in treatment of bipolar disorder, replicating results in various controlled and uncontrolled studies from Western countries.
The anthracycline doxorubicin (Dox) is an effective antitumor agent. However, its use is limited because of its toxicity in the heart. N-Benzyladriamycin-14-valerate (AD 198) is a modified anthracycline with antitumor efficacy similar to that of Dox, but with significantly less cardiotoxicity and potentially cardioprotective elements. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of in vivo protective effects of low-dose AD 198 against Dox-induced cardiomyopathy. To do this, rats were divided into four groups: vehicle, Dox (20 mg/kg; single injection day 1), AD 198 (0.3 mg/kg per injection; injections on days 1, 2, and 3), or a combination treatment of Dox + AD 198. Seventy-two hours after beginning treatment, hearts from the Dox group had decreased phosphorylation of AMP kinase and troponin I and reduced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, β-tubulin, and serum albumin expression. Dox also increased the phosphorylation of phospholamban and expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase in hearts. Each of these Dox-induced molecular changes was attenuated in the Dox + AD 198 group. In addition, excised hearts from rats treated with Dox had a 25% decrease in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and a higher than normal increase in LVDP when perfused with a high extracellular Ca(2+) solution. The Dox-induced decrease in baseline LVDP and hyper-responsiveness to [Ca(2+)] was not observed in hearts from the Dox + AD 198 group. Thus Dox, with well established and efficient antitumor protocols, in combination with low levels of AD 198, to counter anthracycline cardiotoxicity, may be a promising next step in chemotherapy.
Hypertension is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) and is the primary risk factor for stroke. Drug trials lowering blood pressure by pharmacological means have demonstrated impressive reduction in both fatal and nonfatal stroke (33 to 50%) that are virtually identical to the predicted stroke reduction, considering the observed diastolic blood pressure change (5 to 6mm Hg). On the other hand, reduction of CHD risk has been less impressive in these same trials. Although statistically significant, the reduction in CHD risk is roughly one-half (14%) of that predicted (25%) when results from these drug trials are analysed in aggregate. Most trials have used moderate to high dosages of thiazide diuretics or beta-blockers as therapies. Several factors may account for the disappointing results in CHD risk reduction. These drugs may induce metabolic disturbances in lipids, increased glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, or cause inadequate regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, thus attenuating the predicted reduction in CHD risk associated with pharmacological blood pressure lowering. Isradipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that is highly effective in lowering blood pressure. Isradipine also has antiatherogenic properties in animal models of atherosclerosis. The effect of isradipine on atherosclerosis in humans is unknown. The Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS) is a 3-year double-blind, randomised trial in over 800 men and women with hypertension, aged 40 years or older. The primary aim of MIDAS is to compare the efficacy of isradipine 2.5 to 5.0mg twice daily vs hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25mg twice daily in retarding the progression of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
In this study, we have used 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats to examine changes in striatal junD and fosB/deltafosB expression induced by acute and chronic treatment with L-DOPA (5 and 15 days). Changes at the protein levels were studied using Western immunoblotting while mRNA changes were compared using in situ hybridization histochemistry. We observed a significant increase in the level of deltaFosB proteins after chronic treatment with L-DOPA, an effect that was not observed for JunD proteins. In addition, the upregulation of deltaFosB was already present after an acute treatment but increased upon chronic treatment. By contrast, junD and deltafosB mRNA were both upregulated significantly above control levels after an acute injection of L-DOPA. In conclusion, this study suggests a differential expression pattern of junD and deltafosB in a rat model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. The upregulation of deltaFosB protein, but not JunD, is likely to reflect an increased stability of the deltaFosB proteins without ongoing enhanced transcription of the encoding genes.
Suboptimal treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and unsatisfactory response to antiemetic drugs cause impairment of cancer patient's daily functioning. This study was aimed to investigate the association of selected germline polymorphisms with ondansetron and metoclopramide response in Indonesian cancer patients treated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
We enrolled 202 chemotherapy naïve patients treated with cisplatin at a dosage of ≥50 mg/m(2) as monotherapy or as combined chemotherapy. Ondansetron 8 mg and dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously were the standard antiemetic therapy for prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Metoclopramide 10 mg orally, three times per day as fixed prescription, was given until 5 days after chemotherapy to prevent delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Primary and secondary outcomes were the occurrence of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in the acute and delayed phase. The following single-nucleotide polymorphisms were determined in ABCB1: rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs1128503; in 5-HT3B-R: rs45460698, rs4938058 and rs7943062; and in CYP2D6: rs16947 (CYP2D6 2), rs3892097 (CYP2D6 4) and rs1065852 (CYP2D6 10) using Taqman assays.
During the acute phase, 21.8 and 30.2% patients experienced Grade 3 and 4 nausea and vomiting, respectively, whereas 38.6% patients experienced nausea and/or vomiting in the delayed phase. Carriers of the CTG haplotype of the ABCB1 gene experienced Grade 3 and 4 chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting more often than other haplotypes in the delayed phase (P< 0.05). No associations were found with the 5-HT3B receptor haplotypes and CYP2D6-predicted phenotypes.
Our study shows that in Indonesian cancer patients treated with highly cytostatic emetogenic, carriership of the CTG haplotype of the ABCB1 gene is related to an increased risk of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
Verapamil (120 mg three times a day) was given as adjunctive therapy to six patients with refractory partial epilepsy who were receiving carbamazepine (CBZ). Within a few days symptoms of CBZ neurotoxicity developed in all six patients. There was a mean rise of 46% in total and 33% in free plasma CBZ concentrations in five of these patients (p less than 0.01), and a simultaneous fall of 36% in the ratio of the principal metabolite, CBZ-10,11-epoxide, to CBZ (p less than 0.001). Two patients with mild symptoms were rechallenged with a lower verapamil dosage (120 mg twice a day) and showed similar rises in CBZ concentration and recurrent neurotoxic symptoms. Verapamil increased the area under the CBZ concentration/time curve during a dose interval by 42% in another patient. Withdrawal of verapamil was associated with a decline in circulating CBZ concentration from 12 mg/l to 7 mg/l and seizure breakthrough in a further patient who was receiving both drugs long term. These results suggest that verapamil inhibits the metabolism of CBZ to an extent likely to have important clinical repercussions.
We report a case of acute interstitial nephritis and fatal Stevens-Johnson syndrome in a 90-year-old woman with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism, who had been treated for 5 weeks with propylthiouracil (PTU). On admission, the patient exhibited acute renal failure and generalized macular purpuric eruption. Acute interstitial nephritis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were diagnosed and PTU withdrawn. Although renal function recovered after PTU withdrawal and corticosteroid therapy, the patient's condition worsened, and she died after developing multiple organ failure. Acute interstitial nephritis seems to be rarely associated with PTU therapy. Moreover, a literature review suggested that this could represent the first published report of a Stevens-Johnson syndrome developing during PTU therapy.
Experiments were performed on seven fentanyl-pentobarbital-anesthetized, open-chest dogs to determine whether stimulation of coronary alpha 1-adrenergic receptors by phenylephrine causes coronary vasoconstriction and impaired myocardial oxygen delivery when phenylephrine is infused to correct isoflurane-induced hypotension. Myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres, and myocardial oxygen and lactate extraction were determined. The Fick equation was used to calculate myocardial oxygen consumption. Measurements were obtained (a) under control conditions, (b) after a 30-min inhalation of isoflurane sufficient to decrease mean aortic pressure by 30%, and (c) while maintaining administration of isoflurane, 5-10 min after restoration of mean aortic pressure by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine. Isoflurane-induced hypotension was accompanied by a baroreceptor-mediated increase in heart rate and by a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption; however, myocardial blood flow was maintained, resulting in decreased oxygen extraction and increased coronary sinus PO2, thus implying a direct coronary vasodilating effect for isoflurane. Lactate extraction was unaffected. Phenylephrine infusion during inhalation of isoflurane returned mean aortic pressure and heart rate to their respective control values, and it did not change myocardial oxygen consumption, myocardial blood flow, myocardial oxygen extraction, coronary sinus PO2, or lactate extraction from values obtained during isoflurane alone. These latter findings are consistent with undiminished coronary vasodilation by isoflurane in the presence of phenylephrine. In conclusion, infused phenylephrine to restore aortic pressure during isoflurane administration had no vasoconstrictor effect in the coronary circulation and did not impair myocardial oxygen delivery. Apparently, the direct coronary vasodilating action of isoflurane completely nullified phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction via local alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.
Anencephaly has been suggested to develop from exencephaly; however, there is little direct experimental evidence to support this, and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear. We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid- to late-gestation mouse embryos. We observed the exencephaly induced by 5-azacytidine at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), let the embryos develop exo utero until E18.5, and re-observed the same embryos at E18.5. We confirmed several cases of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly. However, in many cases, the exencephalic brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period. To analyze the transformation patterns, we classified the exencephaly by size and shape of the exencephalic tissue into several types at E13.5 and E18.5. It was found that the transformation of exencephalic tissue was not simply size-dependent, and all cases of anencephaly at E18.5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of exencephalic tissue at E13.5. Microscopic observation showed the configuration of exencephaly at E13.5, frequent hemorrhaging and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the exencephalic head at E15.5, and multiple modes of reduction in the exencephalic tissue at E18.5. From observations of the vasculature, altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the exencephalic head. These findings suggest that overgrowth of the exencephalic neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels, subsequent peripheral circulatory failure and/or hemorrhaging in various parts of the exencephalic head, leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly.
We examined nimodipine modification of bupivacaine toxicity in anesthetized male rats. Three minutes after pretreatment, group 1 (n = 11), group 3 (n = 10), and their respective control groups (n = 11 and n = 9) received intravenous bupivacaine LD50 (median lethal dose). After pretreatment, group 2 (n = 10), group 4 (n = 8), and their respective control groups (n = 10 and n = 8) received intravenous bupivacaine LD90 (90% lethal dose). Pretreatment was 200 micrograms/kg intravenous nimodipine in groups 1 and 2 and 500 micrograms/kg in groups 3 and 4. Control animals were pretreated with intravenous saline solution. Data were analyzed by chi 2-analysis and analysis of variance. Survival increased after 200 micrograms/kg nimodipine (P less than 0.05). In group 1, 9 (81%) of 11 survived compared with control animals (4 [36%] of 11). In group 2, 8 (80%) of 10 survived compared with control animals (2 [20%] of 10). Survival was not increased after 500-micrograms/kg nimodipine pretreatment. In group 3, 2 (22%) of 9 survived compared with control animals (4 [40%] of 10). In group 4, 4 (50%) of 8 survived compared with control animals (2 [25%] of 8). We conclude that nimodipine pretreatment with 200 micrograms/kg protects against fatal toxicity from LD50 and LD90 bupivacaine, but 500 micrograms/kg does not.
1H NMR spectroscopy provides a useful initial biochemical screen with which to detect abnormal patterns of metabolites in urine collected from animals with different sites of nephrotoxic lesions. Male Fischer 344 rats were treated with nephrotoxic doses of sodium chromate (pars convoluta of proximal tubule), cisplatin, hexachlorobutadiene, mercury II chloride (pars recta of proximal tubule), propylene imine, and bromoethanamine (renal papilla) in order to induce damage in specific regions of the kidney. Urine was collected for up to 48 hr after dosing and was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (400 MHz) and conventional biochemical methods to provide biochemical fingerprints of urine in various site-specific nephrotoxic states. Hexachlorobutadiene and HgCl2 produced severe glycosuria and transient enzymuria. 1H NMR urinalysis revealed aminoaciduria, glycosuria, and lactic aciduria after exposure to all proximal tubular toxins except cisplatin, whereas papillary insult resulted in early elevations in urinary trimethylamine N-oxide and dimethylamine, together with later elevations in urinary acetate, succinate, and N,N-dimethylglycine (after propylene imine). Trimethylamine N-oxide and dimethylamine are suggested as novel markers of site-specific renal papillary injury in the rat.
An adverse reaction to the acute administration of sublingual nifedipine is reported. Subsequent reversal was by intravenous administration of calcium chloride.
Trials demonstrate the efficacy of medications to reduce the risk for invasive breast cancer.
To summarize benefits and harms of tamoxifen citrate, raloxifene, and tibolone to reduce the risk for primary breast cancer.
MEDLINE and Cochrane databases from inception to January 2009, Web of Science, trial registries, and manufacturer information.
Predefined eligibility criteria were used to select articles. English-language reports of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) for benefits and RCTs and observational studies for harms were included.
Two reviewers assessed study data, quality, and applicability.
Seven placebo-controlled RCTs and 1 head-to-head trial provide results for main outcomes. Tamoxifen (risk ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.82]; 4 trials), raloxifene (risk ratio, 0.44 [CI, 0.27 to 0.71]; 2 trials), and tibolone (risk ratio, 0.32 [CI, 0.13 to 0.80]; 1 trial) reduce risk for invasive breast cancer compared with placebo by 7 to 10 per 1000 women per year. Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer but not estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer, noninvasive breast cancer, or mortality. All medications reduce fractures. Tamoxifen (risk ratio, 1.93 [CI, 1.41 to 2.64]; 4 trials) and raloxifene (risk ratio, 1.60 [CI, 1.15 to 2.23]; 2 trials) increase thromboembolic events by 4 to 7 per 1000 women per year; raloxifene causes fewer events than tamoxifen. Tamoxifen increases risk for endometrial cancer (risk ratio, 2.13 [CI, 1.36 to 3.32]; 3 trials) compared with placebo by 4 per 1000 women per year and causes cataracts compared with raloxifene. Tibolone causes strokes in older women.
Bias, trial heterogeneity, and a dearth of head-to-head trials limit this review. Data are lacking on doses, duration, and timing of the medications; long-term effects; and nonwhite and premenopausal women.
Three medications reduce risk for primary breast cancer but increase risk for thromboembolic events (tamoxifen, raloxifene), endometrial cancer (tamoxifen), or stroke (tibolone).
This study was undertaken to evaluate an assay to assess the risk for drug-induced immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Groups of five to 10 guinea-pigs were given six ip injections of the test compound on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12. Aluminium hydroxide was also given in the first injection. At day 33, the animals were given an iv injection of the test compound and the response was recorded by grading the severity of clinical symptoms. Cutaneous passive anaphylaxis was also evaluated in six naive guinea pigs using Evans blue and sera collected from treated animals on day 26. A panel of six positive model compounds (ovalbumin, aprotinin, chymopapain, tetracosactide, cyanocobalamin and procaine), and the negative compound Ribomunyl were tested. Positive systemic and/or cutaneous anaphylactic responses were observed with ovalbumin, aprotinin, chymopapain and tetracosactide whereas no responses were noted with cyanocobalamin, procaine and Ribomunyl. Our results suggest that this protocol can help differentiate positive model compounds (known to induce reactions in man) from negative model compounds, provided that their molecular weight is large enough, but that it is not applicable to substances of low molecular weight.
To evaluate the effect of acute blood pressure reduction on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the peripheral circulation of essential hypertensive patients.
A parallel group study; endothelial function measured in 64 essential hypertensive patients before and after (2 h) treatment with nifedipine (20 mg, n = 32) or captopril (50 mg, n = 32), p.o., randomly assigned.
In hypertensive patients, we evaluated flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation (FMD, high resolution ultrasound) of the brachial artery compared with endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, 25 microg s.l.). Automatic computerized analysis was used to measure brachial artery diameter on end-diastolic frames acquired every second during the study. Sixty-six healthy normotensive subjects were also evaluated to assess the presence of endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients.
Hypertensive patients showed a significantly (P< 0.01) lower FMD (5.9 +/- 2.5%) as compared to healthy controls (7.7 +/- 3.8%). The response to GTN was similar in normotensive subjects (7.5 +/- 3.1%) and hypertensive patients (7.2 +/- 6.5%). At baseline brachial artery diameter, FMD and response to GTN were similar in the nifedipine- and captopril-treated groups. Nifedipine and captopril similarly reduced blood pressure, but only nifedipine increased heart rate. Acute nifedipine, but not captopril, significantly (P< 0.01) increased brachial artery diameter, while FMD and response to GTN were not modified after nifedipine or captopril.
Endothelial dysfunction in the brachial artery of essential hypertensive patients is not improved by acute blood pressure reduction.
Sulphasalazine is a commonly used second line agent in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory joint diseases and is reported to be one of the least toxic of this group of drugs. Recently a severe allergic reaction and cases of lupus-like disease have been described in patients with RA after treatment with sulphasalazine. We describe five patients, all with inflammatory arthropathy who developed cutaneous vasculitis, lupus-like disease or atypical serology after exposure to sulphasalazine. Three of four cases investigated were found to have the slow acetylator phenotype. These reactions can complicate the diagnosis and delay discontinuation of the drug. Moreover, present guidelines for the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus do not apply to the majority of patients with sulphasalazine-induced lupus.
To investigate the frequency of numerical aberrations for chromosomes 7 and 8 in the sperms of workers exposed to benzene series.
Numerical aberrations in the sperms of workers were detected by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization with biotin labeled chromosome 7 probe (D7Z1) and digoxingenin labeled chromosome 8 probe (D8Z1).
The time-weight average air concentration (TWA) of benzene in the workshop was 42.29 mg/m(3), which was significantly higher than that of the national maximum allowable concentration [6 mg/m(3)]. The concentration of urinary trans,trans-muconic acid(ttMA) in the exposed group was also higher than that of the control group. In all, 155721 sperm nuclei from 15 workers in the exposed group and 123771 sperm nuclei from 12 individuals in the control group were examined. The results showed that the frequency of diploidy sperms and the frequencies of disomic sperm for chromosomes 7 and 8 in the exposed group (0.129%, 0.170%, 0.078%) were significantly higher than those of the control group (0.055%, 0.053%, 0.033%), respectively. The frequencies of nullisomic sperm for chromosomes 7 and 8 in the exposed group (0.165%, 0.088%) were also significantly increased, compared with those of the control group (0.056%, 0.029%). A statistically significant difference in the frequency of overall numerical chromosome aberrations was seen between the exposed group (0.745%) and the control group (0.289%).
The results suggested that higher concentration of benzene may induce higher frequencies of numerical aberrations in the sperms of workers exposed to benzene series.
Antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated mania or hypomania has been well documented in the literature but these patients with switch have either mood disorders or various risk factors for bipolar disorder. This case report examines SSRI-induced hypomania in a patient with dissociative disorder and highlights hypomania as a genuine side-effect of sertraline rather than a switch.
A 23-year-old female patient with dissociative disorder has been described.
Hypomanic symptoms emerged during treatment with sertraline at the dose of 50 mg/day after 3-4 days of initiation of therapy and had complete recovery within 7 days after stopping sertraline.
In the absence of risk factors for manic switch, sertraline-induced hypomania may be a true side-effect of drug.
