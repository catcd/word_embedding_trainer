Boophilus microplus (Canestrini) (Acari: Ixodidae), collected in Hidalgo County, TX, were determined to be resistant to permethrin. Discriminating dose (DD) tests at the LC99 and 2X the LC99 of susceptible ticks yielded lower than expected mortalities for permethrin but not for coumaphos or amitraz acaricides. Initial bioassay results confirmed the pyrethroid resistance detected in the DD assays. Two generations of selection with permethrin at a rate > 60% increased the measured resistance ratios from 9.5 (7.9-11.5) to 263 (217-320). Synergist studies suggested that metabolic enzymes were involved in permethrin resistance. Native gel electrophoresis verified that the CZS9 esterase was not involved in resistance to permethrin. Polymerase chain reaction examination revealed the presence of a mutation of the sodium channel gene (Phe [arrow] Ile amino acid substitution in the S6 trans-membrane segment of domain III), in the resistant B&H population. The frequency of this mutation increased after selection with permethrin and concurrent increase in estimated resistance ratios. The B&H population was eradicated from the United States by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Veterinary Services, Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program through the use of the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos.
Acetaminophen is an effective mild analgesic and antipyretic agent. In double-blind, controlled experimental pain studies of short duration, acetaminophen is superior to placebo and produces analgesia comparable to that produced by aspirin. The frequency of adverse reactions to therapeutic doses of acetaminophen is low, as is that of aspirin. Overdosage with acetaminophen, however, may result in irreversible hepatotoxicity. Since clinical manifestations of intoxication can be of slow onset, physicians may tend to delay initiation of definitive therapy. Intravenous cysteamine, and possibly oral methionine, appear to be effective in preventing hepatotoxicity if they are administered with 10 h of drug ingestion. Physicians should be aware of the potential danger of acetaminophen overdosage and alerted to its clinical manifestations.
Lectin-like oxidized LDL (oxLDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1), a novel scavenger receptor highly expressed in human and experimental atherosclerotic lesions, is responsible for the uptake of oxLDL in vascular cells. We demonstrated previously that Tanshinone II-A (Tan), a pharmacologically active compound extracted from the rhizome of the Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, inhibits atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic rats, rabbits, and apolipoprotein-E deficient (ApoE⁻/⁻) mice. However, the precise mechanism by which Tan protects against atherogenesis remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we hypothesized that Tan can suppress the uptake of oxLDL by diminishing the expression of LOX-1 via suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby contributing to reduced macrophage foam cell formation. In cultured murine macrophages, oxLDL induced LOX-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, was abrogated by addition of Tan or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic acid ammonium salt (PDTC), a widely used inhibitor of NF-κB, suggesting the involvement of NF-κB. Tan also reduced LOX-1 expression in atherosclerotic lesions of ApoE⁻/⁻ mice fed a high cholesterol diet. Mechanistically, Tan suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-κB P65 subunit and phosphorylation of IκB-α induced by oxLDL. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that Tan inhibited the nuclear protein binding to NF-κB consensus sequence. Functionally, we observed that Tan inhibited DiI-oxLDL uptake by macrophages in a fashion similar to that produced by LOX-1 neutralizing antibody. Our current findings reveal a novel mechanism by which Tan protects against atherogenesis and shed new light on the potential therapeutic application of Tan to the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to investigate renal vascular abnormalities in the maintenance phase of norepinephrine-induced ischemic acute renal failure. In this model uremia peaks in the first 5 days with progressive recovery of renal function which approaches control at 25 days. Renal blood flow returns to normal in the first week. Micropuncture experiments revealed that there was a dual nephron population during the first 3 days of acute renal failure. The majority of proximal tubules had elevated pressures from tubular obstruction. The nephron filtration rate responses in these nephrons were similar to normal if tubular obstruction was relieved, indicating that glomerular filtration dynamics were not impaired. In other nephrons tubular pressures were low, and venting the tubules did not increase nephron filtration. In these nephrons glomerular blood flowed and capillary pressures were reduced. There was no evidence of tubular fluid backleak from 14C-inulin microperfusion. A second vascular abnormality was an absence of renal blood flow autoregulation at 1 week in acute renal failure. The autoregulatory defect could be corrected by renal denervation.
The histologic appearance and cytochemical characteristics of foci of hepatic cellular alteration, hepatic nodules, and hepatocellular carcinomas occurring in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with the hypolipidemic agent clofibrate (CAS: 637-07-0), with phenobarbital (CAS: 50-06-6), or with diethylnitrosamine [(DENA) CAS: 55-18-5] followed by phenobarbital were studied after treatment periods from 1 month to 2 years. Rats treated with clofibrate revealed foci of cellular alteration that were more often basophilic and occurred slightly sooner (wk 42) than those in untreated controls (wk 60). Of 36 rats that had received 68 or more weeks of continuous clofibrate, 19 had hepatic nodules. Of the 11 nodules examined cytochemically, none was gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive and 2 were positive to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) under oxygen. In rats withdrawn from clofibrate for 16-18 weeks after 68-95 weeks of clofibrate, 0 of 14 had nodules. In several of these rats zones of hepatic scarring were observed, suggesting the reversibility of the nodules. Phenobarbital alone had little effect on the incidence of foci of cellular alteration, although the number of gamma-GT-positive foci was increased. DENA followed by phenobarbital led to the early appearance of foci of cellular alteration (from wk 4), of nodules (from wk 13), and of hepatocellular carcinomas (from wk 26). gamma-GT activity was raised in most of these nodules and carcinomas, while G-6-PD activity was raised in only 3 of 9 nodules but in all 9 carcinomas examined. DENA-phenobarbital given for 13 or 26 weeks followed by withdrawal of phenobarbital for 28 and 26 weeks, respectively, produced an essentially similar pattern of lesions. In view of the growing recognition of the nonspecificity gamma-GT as a marker of carcinogen-initiated foci, the value of G-6-PD (under oxygen) as a marker merits further investigation.
The incidence of toxicity associated with the use of valproic acid (VPA) is considered remarkably low compared to other antiepileptic drugs. This study reports the toxicity of VPA administered as a single drug to 88 children in relation to the daily dose and drug plasma level. The frequency of side effects observed clinically was 42.0%, but it increased to 80.7% when a questionnaire was introduced. In spite of the limitations of this method, the results show the need to perform systematic surveillance for side effects of all antiepileptic drugs, similar to those made to assess their clinical effectiveness. Anorexia, vomiting, and sleep alterations were the most common side effects detected in the clinical record; patients who showed anorexia, hyperactivity, lassitude, sleep disturbances, and sadness had received daily doses significantly higher than patients not showing side effects. Similarly, the children who needed to reduce or discontinue the treatment were receiving the highest doses. No relations, however, could be established between the incidence of side effects and plasma levels of VPA except for lassitude and drowsiness. Severe or fatal toxicity was not detected.
Two elderly women suffered an acute deterioration of renal function after treatment with cefoxitin sodium. One with stable chronic renal failure due to reflux nephropathy underwent a rapid deterioration of renal function which proved fatal. The other woman had rheumatoid arthritis and developed acute tubular necrosis after treatment with gentamicin and cefoxitin. All the data suggested that the antibiotic was responsible for the deterioration in renal function. The dose of cefoxitin should be reduced in patients with renal functional impairment. Cefoxitin should either be used with great caution or not prescribed in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics.
Trichloroethylene (TCE) has previously been shown to be carcinogenic in mouse liver when administered by daily gavage in corn oil. The metabolism of TCE results, in part, in the formation of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) as a major metabolite and dichloroacetic acid (DCA) as a minor metabolite. These chlorinated acetic acids have not been shown to be genotoxic, although they have been shown to induce peroxisome proliferation. Therefore, we determined the ability they have been shown to induce peroxisome proliferation. Therefore, we determined the ability of TCE, TCA, or DCA to act as tumor promoters in mouse liver. Male B6C3F1 mice were administered intraperitoneally 0, 2.5, or 10 micrograms/g body wt ethylnitrosourea (ENU) on Day 15 of age. At 28 days of age, the mice were placed on drinking water containing either TCE (3 or 40 mg/liter), TCA (2 or 5 g/liter), or DCA (2 or 5 g/liter). All drinking waters were neutralized with NaOH to a final pH of 6.5-7.5. The animals were killed after 61 weeks of exposure to the treated drinking water (65 weeks of age). Both DCA and TCA at a concentration of 5 g/liter were carcinogenic without prior initiation with ENU, resulting in hepatocellular carcinomas in 81 and 32% of the animals, respectively. DCA and TCA also increased the incidence of animals with adenomas and the number of adenomas/animal in those animals that were not initiated with ENU. While 2.5 micrograms/g body wt ENU followed by NaCl in the drinking water resulted in only 5% of the animals with hepatocellular carcinomas, 2.5 micrograms/g body wt ENU followed with 2 or 5 g/liter DCA resulted in a 66 or 78% incidence of carcinoma, respectively, or, followed with 2 or 5 g/liter TCA, resulted in a 48% incidence at either concentration. None of the untreated animals had hepatocellular carcinomas. Therefore our results demonstrate that DCA and TCA are complete hepatocarcinogens in B6C3F1 mice.
Isolated abducens nerve palsy is a rare complication of treatment with various drugs. Here, the authors report the case of a 23-year-old female with isolated left abducens nerve palsy after long-term retinoic acid therapy. The association is based on the temporal relationship and the exclusion of other possible etiologic factors following extensive laboratory and imaging diagnostics. The authors suggest that isolated abducens nerve palsy may be a presenting sign of a toxic neuropathy associated with retinoic acid therapy. After the exclusion of other organic lesions, especially idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and an assessment of the risk-benefit ratio, discontinuation of treatment must be considered in such cases.
Patients with decompensated hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis tend to have low or undetectable HBV replication. However, some patients continue to have high levels of HBV replication and effective suppression of HBV replication with antiviral agents may potentially decrease hepatic necroinflammation and improve or stabilize liver function. This review was to understand the efficacy and safety of lamivudine in the treatment of decompensated HBV cirrhosis.
An English-language literature search (MEDLINE January 1988-July 2005) was performed, and a total of 52 articles/abstracts relevant to the issue were selected. After review of the selected papers, the meaningful results and conclusions were extracted using scientific criteria. The papers reviewed pertained mainly to the efficacy and safety profiles of lamivudine treatment for decompensated HBV cirrhosis.
The ultimate treatment of decompensated HBV cirrhosis is liver transplantation, but lamivudine treatment may lead to rapid suppression of viral replication and improvement of biochemical and clinical parameters, reduced morbidity and hospitalization for complications of liver disease, increased pre-transplant survival as well as reduced need for transplantation. However, viral resistance can develop after prolonged treatment with lamivudine, and breakthrough hepatitis may be fatal in few patients. Adefovir is effective for lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants.
Antiviral therapy with lamivudine for decompensated HBV cirrhosis can be effective. However, some patients may experience a hepatitis flare with the emergence of YMDD mutants resulting in progressive worsening of liver disease, and should be referred for "rescue" therapy with other nucleoside/nucleotide analogues such as adefovir dipivoxil.
The effect of pre-injection of lignocaine 10 mg or physiological saline was assessed in a double blind trial on 100 unpremedicated day cases having a methohexitone induction. The incidence of pain was reduced from 64% to 22% using lignocaine.
Extra care must be taken in treating patients with clozapine because of the serious side-effects. A 44-year-old man with schizophrenia developed delirium on two occasions immediately after restarting clozapine at the dosage he had previously tolerated well; the clozapine-free periods had lasted 2 and 10 days respectively. Because of this 're-challenge' it seems very likely that there is a causal relation between the direct resumption of treatment with clozapine and delirium. Even if clozapine treatment is interrupted for only a short time it is important that the 'new' course begins with a low dosage and is increased very cautiously until it reaches the former, tolerated level.
SePP (selenoprotein P) is central for selenium transport and distribution. Targeted inactivation of the Sepp gene in mice leads to reduced selenium content in plasma, kidney, testis and brain. Accordingly, activities of selenoenzymes are reduced in Sepp(-/-) organs. Male Sepp(-/-) mice are infertile. Unlike selenium deficiency, Sepp deficiency leads to neurological impairment with ataxia and seizures. Hepatocyte-specific inactivation of selenoprotein biosynthesis reduces plasma and kidney selenium levels similarly to Sepp(-/-) mice, but does not result in neurological impairment, suggesting a physiological role of locally expressed SePP in the brain. In an attempt to define the role of liver-derived circulating SePP in contrast with locally expressed SePP, we generated Sepp(-/-) mice with transgenic expression of human SePP under control of a hepatocyte-specific transthyretin promoter. Secreted human SePP was immunologically detectable in serum from SEPP1-transgenic mice. Selenium content and selenoenzyme activities in serum, kidney, testis and brain of Sepp(-/-;SEPP1) (SEPP1-transgenic Sepp(-/-)) mice were increased compared with Sepp(-/-) controls. When a selenium-adequate diet (0.16-0.2 mg/kg of body weight) was fed to the mice, liver-specific expression of SEPP1 rescued the neurological defects of Sepp(-/-) mice and rendered Sepp(-/-) males fertile. When fed on a low-selenium diet (0.06 mg/kg of body weight), Sepp(-/-;SEPP1) mice survived 4 weeks longer than Sepp(-/-) mice, but ultimately developed the neurodegenerative phenotype. These results indicate that plasma SePP derived from hepatocytes is the main transport form of selenium supporting the kidney, testis and brain. Nevertheless, local Sepp expression is required to maintain selenium content in selenium-privileged tissues such as brain and testis during dietary selenium restriction.
Losartan potassium, an orally active, highly selective AT1 angiotensin II receptor inhibitor, effectively reduces blood pressure by direct receptor blockade, thereby lessening the likelihood of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated side effects such as dry cough or possibly angioedema.
In this multinational, double-blind, randomized, parallel study, the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily losartan (50 mg) versus once-daily ACE inhibitor (captopril; 50 mg) was evaluated in 163 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Non-responders after a 6-week treatment period had the dosage doubled for both study drugs until the end of study (week 12).
Mean reductions in trough sitting diastolic blood pressure were significantly greater in the losartan group at week 6 (7.8 mmHg) and week 12 (9.1 mmHg) than in the captopril group (5.2 and 5.7 mmHg, respectively). Losartan and captopril were well tolerated. Headache was the most common adverse event reported in both groups.
It was concluded that a once-daily administration of losartan was significantly more effective in this study in lowering sitting diastolic blood pressure than once-daily administration of captopril in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Both losartan and captopril regimes were well tolerated.
Potential antiviral properties of cyclosporine against hepatitis C virus have been highlighted in several publications. Therefore, we investigated the effect of a switch from tacrolimus to cyclosporine in a liver transplant recipient with recurrent hepatitis C who did not respond to antiviral therapy. The patient received a liver transplant for hepatitis C cirrhosis. Initial immunosuppressive treatment was based on tacrolimus. Because of viral activity, a combined therapy was initiated 20 months later including interferon and ribavirine. Then, due to a lack of virological and biochemical response, tacrolimus was replaced by cyclosporine (Neoral), while maintaining the same antiviral therapy. Decreases in the viral load and transaminases levels were observed.
Elevated plasma homocysteine has been implicated as a risk factor for hypertension. C677T polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) is a major determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia, which results in endothelial dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to remedy the endothelial dysfunction and restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. The co-existence of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes, targets, receptors, and transporters may influence the drug efficacy. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether short-term blood pressure control by benazepril, an ACE inhibitor, was modulated by C677T MTHFR gene polymorphism.
A total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged 27 to 65 years, without any anti hypertensive therapy within 2 weeks were included. All of them were treated orally with benazepril at a single daily fixed dosage of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at baseline and on the 16th day of treatment. Among them, the frequency of MTHFR C677T genotype CC, CT and TT was 24.3%, 51.8%, and 23.9%, respectively. In a recessive model (CC+CT versus TT genotype), both baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and diastolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP) were significantly higher in patients with the TT genotype than in those with the CT or CC genotype (P value=0.0076 for DBP, and P value=0.0005 for DeltaDBP). We further divided all patients into three groups based on the tertiles of the DeltaBP distribution. Compared to subjects in the lowest tertile of DeltaDBP, the adjusted relative odds of having the TT genotype among subjects in the highest tertile was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.9). However, baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and SBP response did not significantly associate with MTHFR C677T polymorphism.
Our finding suggests that MTHFR C667T polymorphism modulated baseline DBP and DBP responsiveness by short-term treatment of ACE inhibitor in Chinese essential hypertensive patients.
-Pulmonary edema, a major manifestation of left ventricular heart failure, renal insufficiency, shock, diffuse alveolar damage and lung hypersensitivity states, is a significant medical problem worldwide and can be life-threatening. The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis and development of pulmonary edema. However, some recent studies have demonstrated surprisingly that TNF can also promote alveolar fluid reabsorption in vivo and in vitro. This protective effect of the cytokine is mediated by the lectin-like domain of the cytokine, which is spatially distinct from the TNF receptor binding sites. The TIP peptide, a synthetic mimic of the lectin-like domain of TNF, can significantly increase alveolar fluid clearance and improve lung compliance in pulmonary edema models. In this review, we will discuss the dual role of TNF in pulmonary edema.

In decompression sickness and during some surgical procedures, air emboli that form sometimes cause serious damage if the gas bubbles find their way to the vital organs. Paralysis of the spinal cord is one of the most serious manifestations induced by air emboli. Exposure to compression chambers is effective in air emboli treatment, but availability of chambers is inadequate and the treatment is lengthy. Until now there has been no fully effective injectable agent that can remedy the damage caused by air embolization. In this work levodopa was chosen as an injectable drug that might help to improve recovery from experimental paraplegia because of the reported effects of levodopa on muscle tone, spasticity and locomotion. To induce air emboli, the descending aorta of rats was chronically cannulated. Two weeks later, after full recovery from surgery, air was injected through the chronically implanted cannula into unanesthetized rats (0.35 ml of air per 100 g, during 4 sec). The paraplegia (paralysis of both hind legs) was manifested 2-10 minutes later. Only animals that had total paraplegia, without any sensation, were used in the experiments. Levodopa was administered 2 minutes after paraplegia was established. The levodopa treatment was repeated each day during one week. After six days, ten levodopa treated (intra-arterially) animals in a group of twelve and six levodopa treated (intraperitoneally) animals in a group of eight recovered completely from paraplegia. In control groups only three from thirteen (untreated), or two from twelve (solvent administration) animals recovered from paraplegia.
We have studied the effects of demeclocycline on the water metabolism of a patient with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion who presented with a serum sodium concentration of 110 meq/litre. Free water clearance was studied before, during, and after treatment with demeclocycline. This study shows that demeclocycline (900 mg/day) can at least partially inhibit the action of ADH in the setting of tumor-induced ADH secretion, with the production of a reversible, partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and with few or no side effects. Demeclocycline may be useful in the treatment of chronic inappropriate ADH secretion.
In 13 of 27 cases of persistent dyskinesia, treatment with amantadine, in an average dose of 300 mg, brought good to moderate improvement. In 14 patients who showed no response whatever, further treatment, with bromocriptine in doses raised gradually to a final daily dosage of 15 mg, was effective in four cases, though the improvement was generally only moderate. In more than 50 percent of the cases of initial tremor induced by lithium therapy, oxprenolol in daily doses of 160--240 mg produced good effects and moderate improvement was noted in a few further cases. In a series of 20 patients with initial tremor due to neuroleptic therapy, on the other hand, the same treatment proved unsuccessful in the majority of cases. This is the converse of the experience gained with the classical antiparkinson agents, which have proved more effective against tremor induced by neuroleptics than against lithium-induced tremor.
In hypertension, elevated levels of oxidative/inflammatory mediators including nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), activating protein (AP-1), c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and cell-regulatory proteins such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), trigger the mobilization of extracellular matrix (ECM) leading to fibrosis, hypertrophy and impairment of cardiac function. Although the heme oxygenase (HO) system is cytoprotective, its effects on cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA-salt) hypertension are not completely elucidated. Here, we report cardioprotection by the HO inducer, heme arginate against histopathological lesions in DOCA-hypertension. Treatment with heme arginate restored physiological blood pressure, and abated cardiac hypertrophy (3.75 +/- 0.12 vs. 3.19 +/- 0.09 g/kg body wt; n =16, P < 0.01), left-to-right ventricular ratio (6.67 +/- 0.62 vs. 4.39 +/- 0.63; n = 16, P < 0.01), left ventricular mass (2.48 +/- 0.14 vs. 2.01 +/- 0.09 g/kg body wt; n = 16, P < 0.01) and left-ventricular wall thickness (2.82 +/- 0.16 vs. 1.98 +/- 0.14 mm; n = 16, P < 0.01), whereas the HO inhibitor, chromium mesoporphyrin, exacerbated hypertrophy and cardiac lesions. The suppression of cardiac hypertrophy was accompanied by a robust increase in HO-1, HO activity, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), ferritin and the total antioxidant capacity, whereas 8-isoprostane, NF-kappaB, JNK, AP-1, TGF-beta, fibronectin and collagen-I were significantly abated. Correspondingly, histopathological parameters that depict progressive cardiac damage, including fibrosis, interstitial/perivascular collagen deposition, scarring, muscle-fiber thickness, muscular hypertrophy and coronary-arteriolar thickening were abated. Our study suggests that upregulating the HO system lowers blood pressure, potentiates the antioxidant status in tissues, suppresses oxidative stress/mediators such as NF-kappaB, AP-1 and cJNK, and suppresses the mobilization of ECM proteins like TGF-beta, collagen and fibronectin, with corresponding reduction of cardiac histopathological lesion and hypertrophy.
In most patients diagnosed with psychotic depression or schizophrenia and treated with electroconvulsive therapy, parallelly administered antipsychotic medication cannot be stopped. Antipsychotic drugs can influence both seizure threshold and seizure activity in different ways.
The present study processes the data of 77 patients treated parallelly with electroconvulsive therapy and antipsychotic drugs. Oral doses of the antipsychotic medication administered the day before the electroconvulsive therapy, stimulus intensity, seizure durations, and impedance were analysed from session to session.
One group of antipsychotics (haloperidol, fluphenazine, risperidone, sulpirid) was not found to influence seizure activity: there was no significant difference in EEG and EMG registered seizure duration or in stimulus intensity between the treated and non-treated group. However, significant difference was found between the next treated and non-treated groups in 40% of the sessions in case of olanzapine, in 50% of the sessions in case of clozapine and in 57% of the sessions in case of zuclopenthixol in EEG or EMG registered seizure duration as well as in stimulus intensity. In the third group (quetiapine) there was a significant difference in each session (2nd session: EMG, p=0.02; 5th session: EEG, p=0.05, EMG, p=0.04). Most of the antipsychotics (olanzapine, clozapine, zuclopenthixol) have been shown to possess epileptogenic properties; only quetiapine reduces seizure activity.
In the clinical use of olanzapine, clozopine and zuclopenthixol seems epileptogenic, whereas in the case of quetiapine seizure reducing properties must be taken into account. Together with the consideration of the accompanying somatic and neurologic disturbances and with the concomitant medications this can influence the treatment of choice.
The present investigation assessed the propensity of an acute psychogenic stressor exposure to induce behavioral change in paradigms assessing fear/anxiety (acoustic startle) and motivation/anhedonia (intracranial self-stimulation) in CD-1 mice. In the acoustic startle paradigm, a 10-min exposure of 2-4 month old mice (young adult mice) to fox odor (2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline; TMT) was associated with decreased acoustic startle relative to mice exposed to the control odor, butyric acid (BA), immediately and relative to both saline and BA exposure 24 h following odor exposure in the home cage. In contrast, a 2-min exposure of young adult mice to TMT was associated with an increase in startle relative to saline and BA during the immediate post-odor test session only. In young adult mice a 2-min and a 10-min exposure to BA resulted in a startle profile of mice reminiscent of saline-treated mice. In comparison to young adult mice, a 2-min exposure of mature adult mice (5-7 months old) to TMT enhanced startle for up to 48 h relative to both saline and BA, while a 10-min exposure of mature adult mice to TMT enhanced startle for 168 h post-odor exposure relative to saline-exposed mice only. However, the greatest increase in startle amplitude (i.e. 48 h) was acquired following the 2-min exposure of mature mice to TMT. Among mature adult mice, a 10-min exposure to BA in the home cage eventuated in enhanced startle relative to saline-exposed animals 168 h following odor exposure. In comparison, exposure of mice to 10 min of TMT depressed responding for VTA brain stimulation at the initial 80 Hz frequency, but was ineffective in elevating reward thresholds relative to mice merely exposed to saline. Mice assessed in the ICSS paradigm were approximately 2-4 months old at the time of surgery and 5-7 months old at the completion of testing. These data suggest that acute odor exposure may induce a fear gradient dependent upon the perceived stressor severity and that the resultant anxiety-like effects are dependent on the duration of odor exposure, age of the animals and the temporal interval between odor presentation and behavioral testing. Moreover, the anxiogenic properties of psychogenic stressors can be separated from their anhedonic effects. The implications of these data for clinical psychopathology are discussed.
Actinic keratosis (AK) occurs on sun-exposed skin and may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). As for its topical treatment, diclofenac/hyaluronic acid (HA) has been recently approved. The NSAID diclofenac is an inhibitor of COX-2; however, its mode of action in cutaneous epithelial cancer cells is largely unknown. Here, the effects of diclofenac/HA were investigated in relation to death ligand-mediated apoptosis (TNF-alpha, TRAIL, and CD95 activation). Whereas diclofenac/HA only moderately induced apoptosis by itself, it resulted in pronounced enhancement of death ligand-mediated apoptosis in sensitive SCC cell lines (3/4). Apoptosis was associated with activation of initiator caspases of the extrinsic pathway (caspase-8/caspase-10). Furthermore, death ligand and diclofenac/HA-mediated apoptosis were blocked by the same caspase inhibitors, indicating related pathways. The proapoptotic effects of diclofenac/HA appeared independent of the p53 pathway. Also, upregulation of death receptors appeared less important; however, strong downregulation of c-FLIP isoforms was seen after diclofenac/HA treatment. The crucial role of c-FLIP was proven through overexpression and knockdown experiments. Thus, induction of apoptosis appears to be highly characteristic of the mode of action of diclofenac/HA, and the therapeutic effect may be related to sensitization of neoplastic keratinocytes for death ligand-induced apoptosis.
Acidic fibroblast growth factor causes an acute and transient nitric oxide-dependent hypotensive effect in experimental animals. However, this response is not found, or is very small, in vitro. We hypothesized that plasma mediators, such as kinins, are involved in aFGF-induced hypotension. We studied the hypotensive effect of intravenous aFGF (1 microg) in control Wistar rats, and compared this response to that in Wistar rats treated with a bradykinin receptor antagonist Na-adamantaneacetyl-D-Arg-(Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-brad yki nin), in kininogen-deficient Brown-Norway-Katholiek (BNK) rats, and in rats depleted of kininogen after repeated treatment with ellagic acid. FGF was administered in the jugular vein and mean arterial pressure was measured through a femoral artery catheter. Following treatment with the bradykinin receptor antagonist, the hypotensive effect of aFGF was reduced 38% with 58 microg of antagonist and by 60% with the 420 microg dose (9 +/- 1 vs 22 +/- 3mm Hg, p<0.01). Mean blood pressure decrease was 12 +/- 1 in BNK rats (p<0.01, vs control) and 10 +/- 2 mm Hg in kininogen-depleted ellagic acid-treated rats (p<0.05, vs control). These findings implicate kinins as necessary mediators for the hypotensive effect of aFGF in vivo. A full hypotensive effect of aFGF requires sufficient amounts of kininogens, the precursor molecules of kinins, as well as bradykinin receptors.
Muscular rigidity was induced in rats by reserpine (10 mg/kg) and the tonic activity of the gastrocnemic muscle was recorded in the electromyogram. Systemic administration of lisuride, an ergoline, resulted in a dose-dependent depression of rigidity. To examine the site of action of lisuride, we injected lisuride into the striatum, the ventricular space, and the spinal subarachnoid space of intact reserpinized rats. Lisuride is effective if injected into either the striatum or the spinal subarachnoid space, the spinal effect being more pronounced. These results suggest that the spinal cord is an important site of action of lisuride.
