A retrospective study was conducted to assess the efficacy of D-penicillamine in the management of cystinuria, as well as to define the frequency and nature of untoward reactions to this drug. Fifty-six individuals were identified who, by stone analysis and/or biochemical studies, met the accepted diagnostic criteria for phenotypic cystinuria. The majority of these patients presented in the second decade of life with evidence of stone formation: renal colic, hematuria, and/or stone passage. Thirty-five individuals were considered to have clinically advanced cystinuria because they had required at least one urinary tract lithotomy. In these advanced cases, frequency of subsequent lithotomies and episodes of renal colic per 100 patient-years of observation were used as indices to measure the efficacy of D-penicillamine treatment. By both measurements, D-penicillamine significantly improved the clinical course of patients. The incidence of acute drug sensitivity reactions (rash, fever, and/or arthropathy) was in excess of 40 percent. Delayed drug-induced proteinuria occurred in 34 percent of treated patients. We conclude that D-penicillamine is useful in the treatment of cystinuria. Because of the significant number of untoward drug reactions, however, we believe the drug should be instituted only in selected, high-risk patients.
Eight selected patients with active acromegaly and elevated GH levels without other endocrine disturbances were submitted to long-term treatment and acute dose-response trials with bromocriptine. Seven patients showed clinical improvement and lowering of GH levels in response to long-term treatment, however, two of these showed only minor changes in GH levels during the acute dose-response trial. Glucose tolerance and heel pad thickness remained unchanged, while urinary hydroxyproline excretion and blood, plasma and erythrocyte volumes decreased. Using daily doses of 20 mg bromocriptine, side effects were generally minor. Severe vasovagal reactions were, however, observed in two patients, in one at the start of treatment, in the other after ingestion of 25 mg bromocriptine. Bromocriptine represents a valuable treatment alternative in acromegaly, but only long-term treatment will separate responders from nonresponders.
Despite its efficacy, including in the prevention of vertical transmission, the antiretroviral nevirapine is associated with severe idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity and skin rash. The mechanisms underlying nevirapine toxicity are not fully understood, but drug bioactivation to reactive metabolites capable of forming stable protein adducts is thought to be involved. This hypothesis is based on the paradigm that drug reactive metabolites have the potential to bind to self-proteins, which results in drug-modified proteins being perceived as foreign by the immune system. The aim of the present work was to identify hemoglobin adducts in HIV patients as biomarkers of nevirapine haptenation upon bioactivation. The ultimate goal is to develop diagnostic methods for predicting the onset of nevirapine-induced toxic reactions. All included subjects were adults on nevirapine-containing antiretroviral therapy for at least 1month. The protocol received prior approval from the Hospital Ethics Committees and patients gave their written informed consent. Nevirapine-derived adducts with the N-terminal valine of hemoglobin were analyzed by an established liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method and characterized on the basis of retention time and mass spectrometric fragmentation pattern by comparison with adduct standards prepared synthetically. The nevirapine adducts were detected in 12/13 patient samples, and quantified in 11/12 samples (2.58Â±0.8 fmol/g of hemoglobin). This work represents the first evidence of nevirapine-protein adduct formation in man and confirms the ability of nevirapine to modify self-proteins, thus providing clues to the molecular mechanisms underlying nevirapine toxicity. Moreover, the possibility of assessing nevirapine-protein adduct levels has the potential to become useful for predicting the onset of nevirapine-induced adverse reactions.
In humans, micro opioid-cocaine combinations (speedballs) have been reported to heighten pleasurable effects and result in greater abuse potential compared to either drug individually. Emerging evidence in animals suggests that the ability of mu opioids to enhance the reinforcing effects of cocaine might be independent of their mu intrinsic efficacy even though mu agonist efficacy appears to be a determinant in the reinforcing effects of micro opioids themselves.
This study examined the relationship between agonist efficacy, self-administration, and the enhancement of cocaine self-administration using the high-efficacy mu agonist etonitazene.
Rhesus monkeys self-administered cocaine, heroin, etonitazene, and opioid-cocaine combinations under a progressive-ratio schedule of intravenous drug injection.
Unlike cocaine and heroin, etonitazene did not maintain consistent self-administration at any dose tested (0.001-1.0 microg/kg/injection). However, combining etonitazene (0.1-1.0 microg/kg/injection) with cocaine (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/injection) enhanced cocaine self-administration, and this enhancement was attenuated by naltrexone. These effects are similar to those obtained by combining non-reinforcing doses of heroin and cocaine. Antagonism of etonitazene-cocaine and heroin-cocaine self-administration by naloxonazine was short lasting and was not maintained after 24 h (when naloxonazine's purported micro(1) subtype antagonist effects are thought to predominate).
The results suggest that high micro agonist efficacy does not guarantee consistent drug self-administration and that the ability of mu agonists to enhance cocaine self-administration does not depend exclusively on reinforcing efficacy. Moreover, the results do not support a major role for micro(1) receptor mechanisms in either etonitazene- or heroin-induced enhancement of cocaine self-administration.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders that manifest in childhood. Immune dysregulation and autoimmune reactivity may contribute to the etiology of ASD and are likely the result of both genetic and environmental susceptibilities. A common environmental contaminant, 2,2',4,4'-tetrabrominated biphenyl (BDE-47), was tested for differential effects on the immune response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from children with ASD (n=19) and age-matched typically developing controls (TD, n=18). PBMC were exposed in vitro to either 100 nM or 500 nM BDE-47, before challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an innate immune activator, with resultant cytokine production measured using the Luminex multiplex platform. The cytokine responses of LPS stimulated PBMC from ASD and TD subjects diverged in the presence of 100 nM BDE. For example, cells cultured from the TD group demonstrated significantly decreased levels of the cytokines IL-12p40, GM-CSF, IL-6, TNFalpha, and the chemokines MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta following LPS stimulation of PBMC pretreated with 100 nM BDE-47 compared with samples treated with vehicle control (p<0.05). In contrast, cells cultured from subjects with ASD demonstrated an increased IL-1beta response to LPS (p=0.033) when pretreated with 100 nM BDE-47 compared with vehicle control. Preincubation with 500 nM BDE-47 significantly increased the stimulated release of the inflammatory chemokine IL-8 (p<0.04) in cells cultured from subjects with ASD but not in cells from TD controls. These data suggest that in vitro exposure of PBMC to BDE-47 affects cell cytokine production in a pediatric population. Moreover, PBMC from the ASD subjects were differentially affected when compared with the TD controls suggesting a biological basis for altered sensitivity to BDE-47 in the ASD population.
A 62-year-old man was brought into the intensive care unit because of a cardiac arrest. After extensive resuscitation, including defibrillation, sinus bradycardia occurred with marked QT prolongation, followed by recurrent episodes of torsade de pointes. Hetero-anamnestic data revealed a suicide attempt with sotalol. Treatment consisted largely of temporary pacing using an external transvenous overdrive pacemaker and administration of glucagon, milrinon and norepinephrine. Eventually, the patient was discharged in good condition. A suicide attempt with sotalol is a rare intoxication with considerable morbidity and mortality. Treatment is primarily based upon counteracting the proarrhythmic effects of sotalol. However, even when therapeutic levels of this drug are used, proarrhythmic effects can occur.
In this prospective, randomised, double-blind study, we compared the effects of two dosage regimens. Pregnant patients at term were randomly assigned to two groups to be given diamorphine 0.4 mg in hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 2.4 ml or diamorphine 0.4 mg in a volume of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% adjusted according to the patient's height and weight. Adequate anaesthesia was provided in all patients in both groups. The onset of the sensory block for cold and pinprick was faster with the fixed dose regimen (p = 0.01). There were more spinal blocks to above the first thoracic dermatome in the fixed dose group (17.1% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.022). Hypotension occurred in 71.7% vs. 50.0% of patients in the fixed dose and adjusted dose groups respectively (p = 0.035). In the fixed dose group, more patients required ephedrine to treat hypotension (79.5% vs. 56.8%, p = 0.022) and a larger median dose was administered (9 mg vs. 6 mg, p = 0.042). The decrease in mean (SD) arterial pressure was less in the adjusted group (35.0 (16.4) mmHg vs. 28.0 (13.5) mmHg, p = 0.036).
Ketamine, 40 ml 0.5% solution, was used in the technique of intravenous regional anaesthesia in 14 patients undergoing upper limb surgery. Satisfactory analgesia was obtained in 12 of the patients. The method is limited by the fact that all patients became unconscious within a few minutes of tourniquet release, and that this could not be prevented by naloxone.
Metformin has been shown to reduce complications and mortality from Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is increasingly used to treat this condition. This agent is, however, associated with a rare but serious risk of lactic acidosis.
We present cases of 10 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who developed acute renal failure and severe lactic acidosis. Despite the severity of their illness, all patients but one survived.
The increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and its treatment with metformin might result in more cases of lactic acidosis. However our case report demonstrates that early and aggressive treatment with haemofiltration can improve outcomes even in the presence of severe acidosis.
To investigate protein and gene expressions of chemokine subtypes CCR3, CCR2A and their respective ligands macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1alpha), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in the normal mouse central nervous system (CNS) and in the hippocampus at different time points during and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE).
CCR3 and MIP-1alpha protein expressions were mapped in the mouse CNS. The protein and gene expressions of CCR3 and CCR2A and their respective ligands MIP-1alpha, MCP-1 in the hippocampus were studies by immunocytochemical and quantitative real-time RT-PCR during and after PISE.
CCR3 and MIP-1alpha gene expression and immunopositive neurones were broadly distributed in the CNS. CCR3 and CCA2A gene and their protein expression were downregulated in the hippocampus at 1 h during PISE. The protein expression of MIP-1alpha, MCP-1 decreased but gene expression increased at 2 h during PISE. In the hilus of the dentate gyrus, significant reduction of the numbers of CCR3, CCR2A, MCP-1 immunopositive neurones occurred from 1 h during to 2 months after PISE, but the number of MIP-1alpha neurones reduced from 2 h during to 2 months after PISE. Induced expression of CCR3 at 1 week, CCR2A, MCP-1 or MIP-1alpha at 1 week and 2 months after PISE was found in reactive astrocytes. MCP-1 was also demonstrated in the blood vessels of the hippocampus at 2 months after PISE.
CCR3 and MIP-1alpha may play important functional roles in the mouse brain. The downregulation of CCR3, CCR2A, MIP-1alpha and MCP-1 in the hippocampal neurones at the acute stage during and after PISE may weaken the neuroprotective mechanisms. However, induced expression of MCP-1 in hippocampal blood vessel may be related to changes in permeability of the blood-brain barrier during epileptogenesis.
Hyperkalaemia with renal tubular dysfunction by oral therapy of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (co-trimoxazole) is described in 2 elderly Japanese patients with lymphoid malignancy, who developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and improved. A high dose of cotrimoxazole induced hyperkalaemia with the elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea, and increased urinary N-acetyl glucosaminase after several days of the drug administration in these patients; one patient became unconscious. Discontinuation of co-trimoxazole normalized serum potassium level and symptoms. A repeated low dose of the drug induced hyperkalaemia. Before the treatment of co-trixomazole, their serum levels of creatinine showed upper limits of normal ranges. In the present study, our cases suggested that patients receiving a high dose of co-trimoxazole should be evaluated for these potential complications during a course of treatment, particularly in elderly patients with preexisting renal dysfunction.
Most tumors exhibit increased glucose metabolism to lactate, however, the extent to which glucose-derived metabolic fluxes are used for alternative processes is poorly understood. Using a metabolomics approach with isotope labeling, we found that in some cancer cells a relatively large amount of glycolytic carbon is diverted into serine and glycine metabolism through phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). An analysis of human cancers showed that PHGDH is recurrently amplified in a genomic region of focal copy number gain most commonly found in melanoma. Decreasing PHGDH expression impaired proliferation in amplified cell lines. Increased expression was also associated with breast cancer subtypes, and ectopic expression of PHGDH in mammary epithelial cells disrupted acinar morphogenesis and induced other phenotypic alterations that may predispose cells to transformation. Our findings show that the diversion of glycolytic flux into a specific alternate pathway can be selected during tumor development and may contribute to the pathogenesis of human cancer.
Estimates of excess risk of valvular heart disease among prior users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine have varied widely. Two major forms of bias appear to contribute to this variability and also result in a systematic under-estimation of risk. The first, a form of nondifferential misclassification, is the result of including background, prevalent cases among both exposed and unexposed persons in calculations of risk. The second bias results from not considering the relatively short duration of exposure to drugs.
We examined data from all available echocardiographic studies reporting the prevalence of aortic regurgitation (AR) and mitral regurgitation (MR) among persons exposed to fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine and a suitable control group. We also included one study in which previously existing AR or MR had been excluded. We corrected for background prevalent cases, estimated incidence rates in unexposed persons, and performed a person-years analysis of apparent incidence rates based on exposure time to provide an unbiased estimate of relative risk.
Appearance of new AR was strongly related to duration of exposure (R2 = 0.75, p < 0.0001). The summary relative risk for mild or greater AR was 19.6 (95% CI 16.3-23.5, p < 0.00001); for moderate or greater MR it was 5.9 (95% CI 4.0-8.6, p < 0.00001).
These findings provide strong support for the view that fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are potent causal factors in the development of both aortic and mitral valvular heart disease.
A case is presented in which rebleeding from an intracranial saccular aneurysm occurred a few minutes after intravenous administration of mannitol during surgery. The relationship between the reducing effect of mannitol on elevated intracranial pressure and the increased pressure gradient across the aneurysm wall, causing risk of rebleeding, is discussed. Procedures that can reduce this risk are summarized.
To identify susceptibility loci for meningioma, we conducted a genome-wide association study of 859 affected individuals (cases) and 704 controls with validation in two independent sample sets totaling 774 cases and 1,764 controls. We identified a new susceptibility locus for meningioma at 10p12.31 (MLLT10, rs11012732, odds ratio = 1.46, P(combined) = 1.88 Ã 10(-14)). This finding advances our understanding of the genetic basis of meningioma development.
We report 3 cases of paradoxical reaction to midazolam after being used for sedation during regional anesthesia. The picture was characterized by a marked aggressiveness. In one case the reaction was treated with general anesthesia, whereas in the other two patients the clinical picture was rapidly reversed by administration of flumazenil. We describe the possible causative mechanisms of this reaction as well as their treatment.
Asthma is a common disease with a complex risk architecture including both genetic and environmental factors. We performed a meta-analysis of North American genome-wide association studies of asthma in 5,416 individuals with asthma (cases) including individuals of European American, African American or African Caribbean, and Latino ancestry, with replication in an additional 12,649 individuals from the same ethnic groups. We identified five susceptibility loci. Four were at previously reported loci on 17q21, near IL1RL1, TSLP and IL33, but we report for the first time, to our knowledge, that these loci are associated with asthma risk in three ethnic groups. In addition, we identified a new asthma susceptibility locus at PYHIN1, with the association being specific to individuals of African descent (P = 3.9 Ã 10(-9)). These results suggest that some asthma susceptibility loci are robust to differences in ancestry when sufficiently large samples sizes are investigated, and that ancestry-specific associations also contribute to the complex genetic architecture of asthma.
To study the expression of type I transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFbetaRI) in renal cortex in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and the regulation of benazepril.
The rats were randomized to following groups: uninephrectomized rats (group C), streptozotocin diabetic rats (group D) and diabetic rats treated with benazepril (group DB). Blood glucose, serum creatinine, body weight, kidney weight and renal protein content as well as angiotensin-convertion enzyme (ACE) activity of plasma, and renal cortex and medulla were observed after 4 weeks of treatment. The expressions of TGFbetaR I mRNA, 1alpha (IV) precollagen, fibronectin (FN) mRNA and TGFbetaR I protein were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Northern blot and Western blot, respectively.
Group DB had hyperglycemia, body weight loss, kidney hypertrophy and increased ACE activity in renal cortex despite a decrease in plasma ACE activity. These changes were associated with 1.12, 4.25, 1.50 and 1.10 fold increase in TGFbetaR I, 1alpha (IV) collagen, FN mRNA and TGFbetaR I protein expressions during a 4 week time course; Administration of benazepril could attenuate hyperglycemia, body weight loss and kidney hypertrophy, ACE activity in plasma and cortex was decreased by 92.00% and 88.77%, respectively, It also could reduce TGFbetaR I, 1alpha (IV) collagen, FN mRNA and TGFbetaR I protein by 63.89%, 61.90%, 45.83%, 52.13%, respectively.
It is suggested that there is an interaction between TGFbetaR I and the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Benazepril can supress the expression of TGFbetaR I in renal cortex.
A 63-year-old male patient admitted with acute inferior myocardial infarction was treated with tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and heparin. 4 hours after the initiation of the rt-PA infusion he showed painful cutaneous alterations on the lower trunk, mistaken as drug-induced rash and later correctly identified as livedo reticularis. Simultaneously, renal function deteriorated. Assuming hypersensitivity vasculitis, we instituted immunosuppressive treatment which proved to be ineffective. Skin biopsy including the deeper layers showed multiple cholesterol emboli. Anticoagulants were stopped and we noticed no further cholesterol embolism or further decline of renal function. 10 previous publications have mentioned a causal relationship between systemic fibrinolytic treatment and the cholesterol crystal embolism syndrome. In 7 cases, however, angiographic procedures were used or the interval between fibrinolysis and the occurrence of cholesterol crystal embolism was too long to exclude spontaneous or heparin-induced cholesterol crystal embolism. The short interval in our own case points clearly to the systemic fibrinolytic therapy as the culprit. We would like to draw attention to the possibility that in individuals with advanced atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta or major arteries, systemic fibrinolytic treatment of myocardial infarction may give rise to the cholesterol crystal embolism syndrome.
Spasm of the sphincter of Oddi is a well-recognized effect of the narcotic class of drugs. Although it is usually clinically silent, such spasm occasionally causes debilitating pain that may be mistaken for more serious disorders. We present the case of a patient who had undergone cholecystectomy previously, but in whom morphine given in the Emergency Department precipitated pain consistent with biliary colic; the pain resolved promptly after administration of naloxone. This entity may considered in the differential diagnosis of acute onset of colicky abdominal pain in the patient given narcotics.
Individuals with factor V or prothrombin gene mutations are at increased risk for thrombotic events. Furthermore, the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis in heterozygous carriers of both factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations is high enough that some investigators suggest lifelong warfarin prophylaxis for these individuals, even with a single spontaneous thrombotic event.
To assess the incidence of factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations in an autopsy population and to determine if these tests can prove useful in identification of at-risk family members.
We analyzed factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations in 45 patients who died with or of thrombotic events, using archival tissue and multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction amplification. The wild-type factor V gene was amplified in all 45 patients, whereas the wild-type prothrombin gene was amplified in 29 patients.
Two patients (4.4%) who died with thrombotic events at the ages of 35 and 92 years were heterozygous for factor V gene mutation. Two additional patients (6.7%), who died with thrombotic events at the ages of 26 and 39 years, were heterozygous for prothrombin gene mutation. Patients homozygous for either factor V or prothrombin gene or simultaneously heterozygous for both genes were not detected in our study.
Our findings suggest that screening the relatives of elderly patients who die with thrombotic events would not be cost-effective because of the low incidence of these mutations in the autopsy population. However, because the incidence of these mutations appeared significantly more frequently among individuals who died at 39 years or younger, testing the relatives of this subset of patients may prove useful for detection of at-risk individuals who would benefit from preventive anticoagulation therapy.
Eight inbred mouse strains were examined for their reactivity to the induction of antinucleolar autoantibody (AnuA) by mercuric chloride (MC). According to the positive ratio and titer of AnuA induced, the strains were grouped into high-, moderate-, low-, and non-responders. Since the susceptibilities to MC were different among strains having the same H-2 haplotype, involvement of H-2 unlinked gene (s) in AnuA induction by MC was suggested.
Reinitiating warfarin sodium therapy in a patient with a recent warfarin-related intracerebral hemorrhage (WAICH) is a difficult clinical decision. Therefore, it is important to assess the outcome of resumption or discontinuation of warfarin therapy after WAICH.
To compare patients who survived an episode of WAICH and restarted warfarin therapy with a group of WAICH patients who did not resume warfarin therapy. Design, Setting, and Patients We conducted a follow-up study from November 1, 2001, through December 31, 2005, in a cohort from a single center. Long-term outcome was assessed at last clinical follow-up or via questionnaire.
Recurrent WAICH and thromboembolic events.
Fifty-two patients were discharged from the hospital after a diagnosis of WAICH. Four patients were lost to follow-up. Mean follow-up among all patients was 43 (range, 1-108) months. Of the 23 patients who restarted warfarin therapy, 1 had a recurrent nontraumatic WAICH, 2 had traumatic intracerebral hemorrhages, and 2 had major extracranial hemorrhages. Of the 25 patients who did not restart warfarin therapy, 3 had a thromboembolic stroke, 1 had a pulmonary embolus, and 1 had a distal arterial embolus.
Restarting warfarin therapy in patients with a recent WAICH is associated with a low risk of recurrence, but patients are subjected to known, substantial risks of warfarin use. Withholding warfarin therapy is associated with a risk of thromboembolization.
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) associated with warfarin sodium therapy is becoming more common as the use of this medication increases in the aging population.
To delineate factors associated with early mortality, determine variables responsible for poor functional outcome, and evaluate possible reasons for expansion of hemorrhage and associated parenchymal edema.
Retrospective study of clinical and radiologic information for 88 patients with warfarin-associated ICH.
A single hospital. Patients Eighty-eight consecutive patients with warfarin-associated ICH.
Patients were included if the international normalized ratio (INR) at presentation with ICH was 1.5 or greater. Computed tomographic scans were reviewed for volumetric analysis of hematoma and perihematomal edema volume. Outcome variables included 7-day mortality, hematoma enlargement, and functional outcome based on the modified Rankin Scale score.
Seven-day mortality (39.8%) was associated with a lower Glasgow Coma Scale sum score and larger ICH volume at presentation. Univariate analysis revealed that a lower Glasgow Coma Score sum score, larger initial ICH volume, higher initial and 48-hour maximum glucose concentrations, and higher percentage of ICH expansion were significantly associated with poor functional outcome at hospital discharge. At multivariate analysis, only Glasgow Coma Score and ICH volume remained significantly associated with functional outcome measured at hospital discharge and at the last follow-up visit. Conversely, INR at presentation, time to INR correction, initial blood pressure, and enlargement of edema were not associated with functional outcome either at hospital discharge or at the last follow-up. Neither serum glucose concentration at admission nor highest level during the first 48 hours had any correlation with ICH or parenchymal edema enlargement. In addition, neither initial INR nor time to INR correction correlated with expansion of ICH or parenchymal edema.
Lower level of consciousness at presentation and larger initial ICH volume predict poor prognosis in patients with warfarin-associated ICH. In our study population, INR at presentation was not associated with functional outcome.
The mechanisms of pancreatic fibrosis were not fully elucidated. Apoptosis has been suggested to be involved in the progression of pancreatic fibrosis. It has been reported that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a crucial role in the formation of fibrosis, including in the kidney, heart, and liver. We recently reported that the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) antagonist losartan has been able to alleviate the pancreatic fibrosis in the rat model, indicating angiotensin II participated in the progression of pancreatic fibrosis. In present study, the possible effects of angiotensin II-mediated apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells were investigated in rat pancreatic fibrosis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) by AT1R, with special reference to the losartan administration.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) were randomly divided into a normal group, a control group, and a losartan-treatment group. Pancreatic fibrosis was induced by infusion of 2% TNBS into the pancreatic duct. Rats were treated with losartan (10 mg/kg) by gavage daily in the losartan-treatment group and the same volume of sterile distilled water was administered to the control group. All treatments started on the first day and ended 8 weeks after the operation. On day 3 and at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8, the histologic changes of the pancreas were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis was investigated by using electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), indicated by the apoptotic index (AI). Expressions of Bax, Bak, and Bcl-2 mRNA in the pancreas were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on day 3 and at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Compared with the control group, losartan treatment significantly alleviated the histologic abnormalities, including infiltration of inflammatory cells and acinar cells atrophy. In the control group, a typical morphologic presentation of acinar cell apoptosis was seen either with electron microscopy or TUNEL staining. The AI was increased in pancreatic tissue. Meanwhile, Bax and Bak mRNA expression was increased, but Bcl-2 mRNA expression was decreased, as compared with the normal group. The administration of losartan resulted in inhibition of acinar cell apoptosis and down-regulation of Bax, Bak, and Bcl-2 mRNA expression. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was lower in losartan-treated rats than in control rats.
Losartan prevents apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cell by blocking AT1R during the development of pancreatic fibrosis. This action may be associated with its regulation of apoptosis-associated genes, such as Bax, Bak, and Bcl-2 mRNA. The results of present study suggest that angiotensin II probably mediates pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis during the course of pancreatic fibrosis.
