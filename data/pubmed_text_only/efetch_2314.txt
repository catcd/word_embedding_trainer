Single doses of aspirin induce scattered foci of necrosis of proximal tubules in some strains of rats, whereas acute or sub-acute administration of phenylbutazone causes renal papillary necrosis. Initially, using Sprague-Dawley rats of CFY and CD strains, it became clear that these rats were not as susceptible to these drugs as the literature suggested. Aspirin-induced necrosis was apparently sex-related, being seen in females but could be induced by hormone treatment in males. Male Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats had reacted differently to administration of phenylbutazone for two weeks. Two experiments were performed with four rat strains: Wistar, Lister-Hooded, Sprague-Dawley, and Fischer-344. The rats were six weeks old at the start of the experiments. Five males and five females of each strain were gavaged with either a single dose of 1,000 mg/kg of aspirin or 200 mg/kg phenylbutazone once daily for four weeks. The drugs were suspended in methylcellulose, which was given to equal numbers of control male and female rats in each experiment. The rats were maintained under standard conditions. Blood and 18-hour overnight urine samples were collected prior to sacrifice. There were no strain-related differences in the types of renal lesions seen, however there were differences in the degrees of responses to the two drugs. With aspirin the female Fischer-344 rats were the most susceptible showing necrosis of proximal tubules of both kidneys and markedly elevated urinary protein concentration and gamma-GT activity. Other females showed less change. Male rats were affected only slightly and males of the Wistar strain were not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Observational studies have suggested that postmenopausal hormone treatment may improve cognitive function, but data from randomized clinical trials have been sparse and inconclusive. The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) is an ancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials. On July 8, 2002, the estrogen plus progestin therapy in the WHI trial was discontinued because of certain increased health risks for women.
To determine whether estrogen plus progestin therapy protects global cognitive function in older postmenopausal women.
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, WHIMS is an ancillary study of geographically diverse, community-dwelling women aged 65 years or older from 39 of 40 clinical centers within the WHI estrogen plus progestin trial that started in June 1995. Of 4894 eligible postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older and free of probable dementia at baseline, 4532 (92.6%) were enrolled in the estrogen plus progestin component of WHIMS. A total of 4381 participants (96.7%) provided at least 1 valid cognitive function score between June 1995 and July 8, 2002.
Participants received either 1 daily tablet containing 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen with 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 2145) or matching placebo (n = 2236).
Global cognitive function measured annually with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination.
The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination mean total scores in both groups increased slightly over time (mean follow-up of 4.2 years). Women in the estrogen plus progestin group had smaller average increases in total scores compared with women receiving placebo (P =.03), but these differences were not clinically important. Removing women by censoring them after adjudicated dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or stroke, and nonadherence to study protocol, did not alter the findings. Prior hormone therapy use and duration of prior use did not affect the interpretation of the results, nor did timing of prior hormone therapy initiation with respect to the final menstrual period. More women in the estrogen plus progestin group had a substantial and clinically important decline (> or =2 SDs) in Modified Mini-Mental State Examination total score (6.7%) compared with the placebo group (4.8%) (P =.008).
Among postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older, estrogen plus progestin did not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo. While most women receiving estrogen plus progestin did not experience clinically relevant adverse effects on cognition compared with placebo, a small increased risk of clinically meaningful cognitive decline occurred in the estrogen plus progestin group.
Several types of mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene lead to abnormal CFTR protein and alterations of chloride and sodium transmembrane transportation in cystic fibrosis (CF). Some investigational compounds such as VX-770 can improve CFTR protein function.
This paper discusses the results of a Phase II study investigating the safety and efficacy of VX-770 in patients with CF.
VX-770 is able to improve chloride and sodium transportation and has a good safety profile. Although such compounds have limited therapeutic targeting potential, preliminary results show great promise in the context of CF therapy.
Morin, a plant-derived flavonoid, has been reported to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological properties. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of morin on hepatic fibrosis induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in rats. Oral administration of morin remarkably prevented weight loss in the body and liver from DMN and inhibited the elevation of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and total bilirubin levels. For the evaluation of hepatic fibrosis-related factors, we investigated expressions of collagen type I, transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in mRNA and protein levels. We observed that morin significantly reduced the expression of collagen type I, TGF-beta(1), and alpha-SMA on hepatic fibrosis induced by DMN. Taken together, this study demonstrated that morin showed hepatoprotective and antifibrogenic effects against DMN-induced hepatic injury. This suggests that morin may be useful in preventing the development of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Postmenopausal women have a greater risk than men of developing Alzheimer disease, but studies of the effects of estrogen therapy on Alzheimer disease have been inconsistent. On July 8, 2002, the study drugs, estrogen plus progestin, in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial were discontinued because of certain increased health risks in women receiving combined hormone therapy.
To evaluate the effect of estrogen plus progestin on the incidence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment compared with placebo.
The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, began enrolling participants from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin trial in May 1996. Of the 4894 eligible participants of the WHI study, 4532 (92.6%) postmenopausal women free of probable dementia, aged 65 years or older, and recruited from 39 of 40 WHI clinical centers were enrolled in the WHIMS.
Participants received either 1 daily tablet of 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 2229), or a matching placebo (n = 2303).
Incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) and mild cognitive impairment (secondary outcome) were identified through a structured clinical assessment.
The mean (SD) time between the date of randomization into WHI and the last Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) for all WHIMS participants was 4.05 (1.19) years. Overall, 61 women were diagnosed with probable dementia, 40 (66%) in the estrogen plus progestin group compared with 21 (34%) in the placebo group. The hazard ratio (HR) for probable dementia was 2.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.48; 45 vs 22 per 10 000 person-years; P =.01). This increased risk would result in an additional 23 cases of dementia per 10 000 women per year. Alzheimer disease was the most common classification of dementia in both study groups. Treatment effects on mild cognitive impairment did not differ between groups (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.74-1.55; 63 vs 59 cases per 10 000 person-years; P =.72).
Estrogen plus progestin therapy increased the risk for probable dementia in postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older. In addition, estrogen plus progestin therapy did not prevent mild cognitive impairment in these women. These findings, coupled with previously reported WHI data, support the conclusion that the risks of estrogen plus progestin outweigh the benefits.
The antiarrhythmic effects of dl'propranolol, d-propranolol, metoprolol and lidocaine against ouabain-induced cardiac arrhythmias were studied. It was found that contrary to earlier findings in the dog, the effects of the adrenergic beta-blockers against ouabain-arrhythmias in guinea pigs were due to beta-blocking activity and not the membrane-stabilizing activity of the compounds. The cardioselective beta-blocker, metoprolol, was more or equally effective as dl-propranolol against ouabain-induced arrhythmias in guinea pigs.
One hundred patients with intolerable cancer pain were treated with intrathecal bolus injections of morphine(IT morphine). The study began 2 days later after port-A cath implantation and continued during the 12 weeks follow-up period. During the investigation, the dosages, pain intensity, side effects, complications, activity and acceptibility were recorded. Initially, the morphine test does(0.2mg) resulted in pain relief for 8-26 hrs (mean 13.4 hrs). Then, changing the morphine dosages or frequency of injections were relied upon the effect of the opiate to provide 24 hrs pain relief. The mean morphine requirements were 0.32mg in 1st week, 0.44mg in 4th week, 1.25mg in 8th week and 1.43mg in 12th week. The mean morphine dose before IT treatment was 36.4mg. The vast majority of patients' pain intensity decreased prominently after IT morphine treatment. But pain was aggravated in the 12th week although the morphine dose increased. Side effects were minimal, and only one patient suffered from meningitis. Complications included 8 patients with port-A system dysfunction, one with anterior spinal artery syndrome, and one case of cauda equina syndrome. Activity improved significantly and all patients accepted the kind of treatment though some patients did not experience completely satisfactory relief from pain. Intrathecal morphine therapy uses only small amounts of opiate to achieve the optimal level of pain relief. So it offers a beneficial treatment option to patients whose pain has become intolerable or who have poor responsiveness to systemic narcotics.
The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial of estrogen plus progestin was stopped early because of adverse effects, including an increased risk of stroke in the estrogen plus progestin group.
To assess the effect of estrogen plus progestin on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and in subgroups, and to determine whether the effect of estrogen plus progestin was modified by baseline levels of blood biomarkers.
Multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial involving 16 608 women aged 50 through 79 years with an average follow-up of 5.6 years. Baseline levels of blood-based markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and lipid levels were measured in the first 140 centrally confirmed stroke cases and 513 controls.
Participants received 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).
Overall strokes and stroke subtype and severity were centrally adjudicated by stroke neurologists.
One hundred fifty-one patients (1.8%) in the estrogen plus progestin and 107 (1.3%) in the placebo groups had strokes. Overall 79.8% of strokes were ischemic. For combined ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, the intention-to-treat hazard ratio (HR) for estrogen plus progestin vs placebo was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.68); with adjustment for adherence, the HR was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.08-2.08). The HR for ischemic stroke was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.09-1.90) and for hemorrhagic stroke, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.43-1.56). Point estimates of the HRs indicate that excess risk of all stroke was apparent in all age groups, in all categories of baseline stroke risk, and in women with and without hypertension, prior history of cardiovascular disease, use of hormones, statins, or aspirin. Other risk factors for stroke, including smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, lower use of vitamin C supplements, blood-based biomarkers of inflammation, higher white blood cell count, and higher hematocrit levels did not modify the effect of estrogen plus progestin on stroke risk.
Estrogen plus progestin increases the risk of ischemic stroke in generally healthy postmenopausal women. Excess risk for all strokes attributed to estrogen plus progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women examined.
Clindamycin was used systemically and periocularly to treat six patients with ocular toxoplasmosis who had a total of eight attacks. Although it appeared to quiet the attack promptly, several side effects were noted. Transient diplopia occured after large periocular doses and papillitis resulted from retrobulbar administration. Despite its efficacy, the results do not seem to warrant high systemic doses for prolonged periods in view of its systemic toxicity. Clindamycin may be most useful as a periocular injection in moderate dosage. A controlled double-blind study is needed.
Myoclonus is a common and well-described adverse effect of opioids. Most cases reported in the literature have been associated with opioid administration, rather than with opioid withdrawal. We describe a case of myoclonus secondary to withdrawal from transdermal fentanyl. We review the literature regarding myoclonus related to opioid therapy (opioid-induced myoclonus) and withdrawal (opioid withdrawal myoclonus), and discuss possible mechanisms and therapies for these phenomena.
To observe the effective mechanism and side effects of thalidomide to multiple myeloma (MM).
Ten cases of MM were studied, of which 3 were previously untreated and 7 refractory or relapsed. Bone marrow microvascular density (MVD) was detected by factor-VIII related antigen and CD(34) immunohistological staining and serum concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) before and after treatment was determined by ELISA. The initial dosage of thalidomide was 100 approximately 200 mg/d with a weekly escalation of 50 mg/d to 450 approximately 650 mg/d. The therapeutic effectiveness is classified into partial remission, improvement and uneffective according to the decrease of serum M protein and bone marrow myeloma cells. Anemia, renal function and blood electrolytes were also observed.
Before treatment, MVD was 73.32 +/- 28.80 and 32.30 +/- 12.50 in MM and control group, respectively, (P < 0.01). MVD in MM group decreased to 56.12 +/- 19.34 after treatment, and was of significant difference (P < 0.05) as compared to the pretreatment value. However, there was still a significant difference as compared to control (56.12 +/- 19.34 vs 32.30 +/- 12.50, P < 0.01). The concentration of VEGF significantly decreased after treatment [from (178.23 +/- 26.56) ng/L to (78.48 +/- 19.98) ng/L, P < 0.01)]. The total effective rate was 70%. There were no serious side effects.
MVD and VEGF concentration were decreased obviously by thalidomide treatment. The dosage of 450 approximately 650 mg/d might be effective in refractory or initial MM.
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious motor side effect of long-term neuroleptic treatment that may persist after drug withdrawal. Alterations in striatal enkephalinergic neurons due to excessive glutamatergic activity is a possible pathogenetic mechanism. We studied the effect of the NMDA antagonist memantine in a rat model of TD, in which vacuous chewing movements (VCM) were induced by 20 weeks of haloperidol administration. The striatal density of preproenkephalin mRNA was measured and the number of neurons estimated. Haloperidol induced persistent VCM that was associated with increased striatal expression of preproenkephalin mRNA. Memantine inhibited the development of haloperidol-induced persistent VCM and attenuated the increase in preproenkephalin mRNA expression. This suggests that glutamate-mediated up-regulation of striatal enkephalin plays a role in the development of haloperidol-induced persistent oral dyskinesias.
Diuretics may induce hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. While severe hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness, severe hypomagnesemia is associated with muscle spasms and tetany which cannot be corrected by potassium and calcium supplementation alone (1,2). Surreptitious diuretic ingestion has been described, mainly in women who are concerned that they are obese or edematous. Symptomatic hypokalemia has been reported in such patients (3-7) and in one case hypocalcemia was observed (8), but the effects of magnesium depletion were not noted in these patients.
Fourteen days administration of haloperidol (1 mg/kg daily) prevented the motor depressant effect of caerulein (an agonist at cholecystokinin receptors, 15 micrograms/kg) and the antagonistic effect of caerulein (100 micrograms/kg) against (+)-amphetamine (5 mg/kg) induced hyperlocomotion in mice. The antiaggressive effect of caerulein (40 micrograms/kg) in saline-treated mice was replaced by increased aggressiveness after long-term haloperidol and diazepam (5 mg/kg daily) treatment. The anticonvulsant effect of caerulein (125 micrograms/kg) against picrotoxin (10 mg/kg) induced seizures was abolished after 14 days diazepam, but not after haloperidol, treatment. The above described changes in the mouse behaviour are probably related to the development of subsensitivity at CCKA receptors, whereas the CCKB receptor subtype becomes more sensitized to the action of caerulein after long-term haloperidol and diazepam treatment.
The objectives of this study were to estimate the effect of prenatal cocaine exposure on fetal growth and gestational age after controlling for exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana and other covariates; to evaluate whether prenatal cocaine exposure has a disproportionate adverse effect on head circumference compared with overall somatic growth; and to assess whether the effect of prenatal cocaine exposure on fetal growth is mediated by cocaine's suspected effect on gestational age.
The study population includes 476 neonates participating in the Miami Prenatal Cocaine Study, a longitudinal follow-up of in utero cocaine exposure. The sample, restricted to full-term neonates born to African-American inner-city mothers, included 253 infants exposed prenatally to cocaine (with or without alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana exposure) and 223 non-cocaine-exposed infants, of whom 147 were drug-free and 76 were exposed to varying combinations of alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana.
Evidence based on structural equations and multiple regression models supports a hypothesis of cocaine-associated fetal growth deficits (0.63 standard deviation) and an independent mild effect on gestational age (0.33 standard deviation). There was no evidence of a disproportionate adverse effect on birth head circumference once the impact on overall growth was estimated. There was evidence that some but not all of the cocaine effect on fetal growth was direct and some was indirect, acting via an intermediate influence of cocaine on gestational age.
Cocaine-associated growth deficits, symmetrical and partially mediated by gestational age, were observed in this sample of inner-city African-American full-term infants prospectively enrolled at birth. Long-term implications will be the subject of future reports from this longitudinal investigation.
The nephrotoxicity of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (HCBD), its glutathione conjugate (HCBD-GSH), cysteine conjugate (HCBD-CYS), and its N-acetyl cysteine conjugate (HCBD-NAC) were compared in male and female Alderley Park rats. Rats, six to eight weeks of age, were given a single intra-peritoneal injection of HCBD or its conjugates and killed 24 hours later. Nephrotoxicity was assessed by histological examination and plasma urea. All three glutathione-derived conjugates produced an elevation of plasma urea and proximal renal tubular necrosis with a similar localization in the pars recta as seen with HCBD. All the conjugates were more nephrotoxic than HCBD itself. HCBD was about four times more toxic to female rats than males. This sex difference was also shown by all the HCBD metabolites.
Thirty-nine patients with psoriasis were treated either with amcinonide ointment 0.1 percent twice a day or with fluocinonide ointment 0.05 percent three times a day in a two-week, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study. The severities of the skin lesions at baseline and at weekly intervals and the overall improvement at weekly intervals were evaluated by the investigator and the patient. The skin lesions improved significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) over their condition at baseline, with good overall improvement attained by both treatment groups within one week. Both treatments were well tolerated. Amcinonide ointment 0.1 percent applied twice a day was found to be as effective and acceptable to patients as was fluocinonide ointment 0.05 percent applied three times a day in the treatment of psoriasis.
A case of acute hemolysis following therapy with carboplatin, an anticancer chemotherapeutic agent, was investigated. Hemolytic anemia has been associated with cisplatin, a related drug, but not with carboplatin.
An 8-year-old boy was treated for an astrocytoma by monthly intravenous injections of carboplatin. Lower back pain was noted after 26 monthly injections, and overt intravascular hemolysis occurred after the 27th injection. The direct antiglobulin test was 4+ with anti-IgG and 1+ with anti-C3d.
Blood samples obtained on Days 28 and 56 after the last injection were tested for carboplatin-dependent antibody. The direct antiglobulin test was 1+ with anti-IgG; the eluate was 1+ with and without carboplatin. The serum indirect antiglobulin test was negative in the absence of carboplatin, 3+ to 4+ in the presence of carboplatin, and 1+ with carboplatin-coated cells. Day 56 serum antibody titer was 64 (agglutination at 37 degrees C), 512 (indirect antiglobulin test) in the presence of carboplatin, and 8 (indirect antiglobulin test) with carboplatin-coated cells.
The findings indicate a carboplatin-induced antibody reacting in vitro by a complex mechanism combining elements of "immune complex," drug adsorption, and autoantibody mechanisms. Drug-dependent hemolysis is a previously unreported but potentially serious complication of carboplatin therapy.
Two infants with features of severe beta adrenergic blockade, pericardial effusions, and myocardial hypertrophy were born to mothers receiving long term treatment with oral labetalol for hypertension in pregnancy. Labetalol was implicated in the aetiology of these problems. Pericardial effusion and myocardial hypertrophy have not been associated with labetalol toxicity in neonates.
Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (PEH) is a sympathomimetic agent that is widely used in common cold disease in children. Though side effects of PEH are well known, it is preferred by many pediatricians in order to benefit from its symptomatic relief in common cold disease. A case of acute urinary retention due to PEH in a three-year-old boy is reported. The aim of this case report is to emphasize the clinical importance and differential diagnosis of PEH overdose in children and to discuss the appropriate treatment approach to PEH overdose in the emergency department.
Glucosamine (GlcN) used by patients with osteoarthritis was demonstrated to reduce pain, but the working mechanism is still not clear. Viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid (HA) is also described to reduce pain in osteoarthritis. The synthesis of HA requires GlcN as one of its main building blocks. We therefore hypothesized that addition of GlcN might increase HA production by synovium tissue.
Human osteoarthritic synovium explants were obtained at total knee surgery and pre-cultured for 1 day. The experimental conditions consisted of a 2 days continuation of the culture with addition of N-Acetyl-glucosamine (GlcN-Ac; 5 mM), glucosamine-hydrochloride (GlcN-HCl; 0.5 and 5 mM), glucose (Gluc; 0.5 and 5 mM). Hereafter HA production was measured in culture medium supernatant using an enzyme-linked binding protein assay. Real time RT-PCR was performed for hyaluronic acid synthase (HAS) 1, 2 and 3 on RNA isolated from the explants.
0.5 mM and 5 mM GlcN-HCl significantly increased HA production compared to control (approximately 2 - 4-fold), whereas GlcN-Ac had no significant effect. Addition of 5 mM Gluc also increased HA production (approximately 2-fold), but 0.5 mM Gluc did not. Gene expression of the HA forming enzymes HAS 1, 2 and 3 was not altered by the addition of GlcN or Gluc.
Our data suggest that exogenous GlcN can increase HA production by synovium tissue and is more effective at lower concentrations than Gluc. This might indicate that GlcN exerts its potential analgesic properties through stimulation of synovial HA production.
A Chinese patient was hypersensitive to a therapeutic dose of suxamethonium because of a genetically determined quantitative and qualitative abnormality of plasma pseudocholinesterase.
Lupus anticoagulant poses a significant risk factor for obstetric complications, whereas heparin improves live birth rates in those pregnancies. Pathophysiology of antiphospholipid antibodies on placental function involves coagulopathies and thrombosis but also dysregulated trophoblast turnover.
With the use of placental explant cultures, we assessed the effect of lupus anticoagulant positive sera (LA + sera) on apoptosis, mitosis, and invasion of trophoblast and determined the role of unfractionated heparin in regulating these functions.
LA + sera were associated with increased placental apoptosis (TUNEL, M30 formation, DNA laddering). LA + sera decreased villous trophoblast proliferation and reduced extravillous trophoblast invasion through matrigel. Heparin attenuated LA + sera-induced apoptosis and facilitated trophoblast invasion.
Lupus anticoagulant may impair placentation by increasing apoptosis, attenuating mitosis and reducing invasion of the trophoblast. The direct effects on trophoblast viability by heparin demonstrate an alternative biologic function for this anticoagulant and raise the possibility that anomalous trophoblast development may be therapeutically regulated.
The risk of precipitating a convulsion in epileptic patients with methohexitone has been judged to vary widely. This article reports such complications arising during methohexitone-activated E.E.G. recording in a series of 48 epileptic patients from whom anticonvulsant medication was withheld. Two patients developed grand mal convulsions during induction with methohexitone 1-0%. Two others exhibited status epilepticus of the petit mal type and one of the myoclonic type, after stopping an infusion of 0-09% methohexitone. The specificity for methohexitone-induced convulsions in epileptics or crypto-epileptics is supported by a review of the literature.
In our microarray analysis we observed that Seven-in-Absentia Homolog 2 (SIAH2) levels were low in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast tumors of patients resistant to first-line tamoxifen therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate SIAH2 for its (a) predictive/prognostic value, and (b) functional role in endocrine therapy resistance.
SIAH2 expression was measured with quantitative Real-Time-PCR (qRT-PCR) in 1205 primary breast tumor specimens and related to disease outcome. The functional role of SIAH2 was determined in human breast cancer cell lines ZR-75-1, ZR/HERc, and MCF7. Cell lines were treated with estrogen (E2), anti-estrogen ICI164.384 or epidermal growth factor (EGF). Moreover, MCF7 was treated with ICI164.384 after silencing SIAH2 expression.
SIAH2 was not prognostic in 603 lymph node negative patients who had not received adjuvant systemic therapy. In multivariate analysis of ER-positive tumors of 235 patients with recurrent disease, SIAH2 as continuous variable, significantly predicted first-line tamoxifen treatment failure (OR = 1.48; P = 0.05) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.79; P = 0.007). Furthermore, in primary breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen, SIAH2 predicted metastasis-free survival (MFS) (HR = 0.73; P = 0.005). In vitro experiments showed that SIAH2 silencing in MCF7 cells resulted in resistance to ICI164.384-treatment when compared with mock silenced cells (P = 0.008). Interestingly, in ZR cells transfected with EGFR (ZR/HERc), SIAH2 expression was induced by E2 but downregulated by EGF.
In primary breast tumor specimens as well as in vitro low SIAH2 levels associated with resistance to endocrine therapy. Moreover, SIAH2 expression showed an opposite regulation by E2 and EGF.
We compared the concentrations of dopaminergic substances in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with clinical severity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) under L-dopa/carbidopa treatment and under L-dopa/carbidopa+tolcapone treatment. Compared with treatment with L-dopa/carbidopa alone, the co-administration of tolcapone produced a significant decrease in clinical severity; a remarkable reduction in the 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) concentration and significant increase in the L-dopa concentration both in the plasma and CSF; and a significant increase in the dopamine concentration in the CSF. The clinical effects of tolcapone were closely correlated with the reduction in the 3-OMD concentration, but not with the increase in the dopamine and L-dopa concentrations in the CSF.
We have examined the effect of both pre- and post-treatment of vitamin E on mercury induced acute toxicity in rats. Mercury (12μmol/kg b.w., single intraperitoneal injection) resulted in oxidative injury and metallothionein mRNA expression together with alterations in tissue histology and accumulation of mercury in the body organs. The ameliorating potential of vitamin E (24μmol/kg b.w., single intraperitoneal injection) was observed in mercury administered rats. Our findings indicate that vitamin E provides complete protection from mercury toxicity in the liver with both pre- and post-treatments. As mercury is nephrotoxic and neurotoxic, it is interesting to note that post-treatment of vitamin E showed more protection in the kidney compared to pre-treatment. In brain tissue, partial protection was observed on oxidative stress parameters. Our results thus suggest that post-treatment with vitamin E could be more beneficial than pre- treatment in mercury intoxication.
Young adults treated with a high potency neuroleptic such as haloperidol are at high risk of developing dystonic reactions. In this retrospective study, 15 of 16 young adult patients treated only with haloperidol had such reactions within 60 hours of beginning the drug, while none of the seven patients treated with haloperidol plus prophylactic benztropine mesylate developed dystonia. Although methodologic considerations limit the generalization of these results, they are consistent with other reports and suggest that initial anticholinergic prophylaxis is warranted in young patients treated with high potency antipsychotics. All dystonic reactions in these patients occurred within 2 1/2 days, justifying the consideration of discontinuing prophylaxis (which also causes side effects) after 1 week.
