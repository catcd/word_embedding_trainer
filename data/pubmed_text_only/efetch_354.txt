Administration of caffeine citrate (caffeine) has been a central component of the treatment of apnea of prematurity. However, given its multiple pharmacologic effects, caffeine might be expected to produce hemodynamic changes in heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and vascular resistance.
In this prospective observational study, we report the hemodynamic effects of intravenous caffeine administration in a population of premature infants who received caffeine to correct or prevent apnea of prematurity.
Hemodynamic effects of caffeine were determined in 31 infants. Stroke volume was measured via echocardiogram, using velocity time integral at the aortic root diameter. Statistically univariate analyses were performed parametrically using paired t-test and nonparametrically (sign test). Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify subgroup covariate effects.
After intravenous caffeine, cardiac index increased in 31 of 31 trials, by an average of 14.6+/-16.3% (s.d.); stroke volume increased in 24 of 31 trials, by 7.8+/-12.2%; heart rate increased in 28 of 31 trials by 7.7+/-7.2 beats per min; and blood pressure increased in 25 of 31 trials, by 4.1+/-5.8 mm Hg (all P<0.001). Multivariate linear regression revealed no significant effect of dose, birth weight, gestational age or postnatal age.
Intravenous caffeine consistently increases cardiac output and blood pressure in relatively stable premature infants, when given to treat or prevent apnea of prematurity. We speculate that there may be a role for caffeine in the hemodynamic treatment of hypotensive/hypoperfused infants.
Thirty-three patients with limited small cell lung cancer (SCLC) received carboplatin, epirubicin and VP-16 chemotherapy, concurrent 'split course' thoracic radiotherapy, followed by surgery for patients achieving an objective response (OR). High-risk patients and those staged T4-N3 (IIIB) at diagnosis, were excluded from surgery. After induction chemoradiotherapy we obtained 90.9% OR, with 63.3% obtaining complete response (CR). Ten patients (30.3%) were eligible for surgery after induction therapy. Five patients (15.1%) were subjected to surgery and five additional patients refused. Of the five patients who were subjected to surgery, four had a complete response (CR), (three pathological confirmations), and one had a partial response (PR), (unresectable). The median survival time for all patients was 16 months with 12.1% of the long-term survivors still living after 2 years and 9% still living after 3 and 4 years. Toxicity consisted mainly of myelosuppression. This study shows a high activity of the chemotherapy and the chemoradiotherapeutic regimen employed but a low feasibility for adjuvant surgery in SCLC.
The structures of porcine and human beta(2)-adrenoceptors differ but the repercussions for porcine cardiac function are unknown. We investigated the function of porcine beta(2)-adrenoceptors in 3 cardiac regions, sinoatrial node, left atrium and right ventricle of newborn piglets. Both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline caused sinoatrial tachycardia: 60+/-10% and 62+/-7% of the maximum response (E(max)) to (-)-noradrenaline (-logEC(50)=9.0) and (-)-adrenaline (-logEC(50)=7.5) respectively, were resistant to antagonism by the beta(1)-selective CGP20712A (2-hydroxy-5-[2-[[2-hydroxy-3-[4-[1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]phenoxy]propyl]amino]ethoxy]-benzamide) (300 nM) but antagonized by beta(2)-selective ICI118551 (erythro(+/-)-[1-(2,3-dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol) (50 nM), consistent with mediation through beta(2)-adrenoceptors. The phosphodiesterase3-selective inhibitor cilostamide and phosphodiesterase4-selective inhibitor rolipram did not affect catecholamine chronotropic potencies. Only small CGP20712A-resistant positive inotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline were detected in the left atria (13+/-2% of E(max)) and ventricular trabeculae (14+/-5% of E(max)). The atrial inotropic responses to (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline faded; fades were prevented by rolipram but not cilostamide or concurrent cilostamide+rolipram respectively. (-)-Noradrenaline (ICI118551 present) increased left atrial cAMP levels through beta(1)-adrenoceptors that were markedly enhanced by rolipram but unaffected by cilostamide. Concurrent cilostamide+rolipram uncovered inotropic and cAMP responses to (-)-adrenaline (CGP20712A present). We conclude that sinoatrial beta(2)-adrenoceptors are more important than beta(1)-adrenoceptors in the mediation of tachycardia caused by both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline in the newborn piglet. beta(2)-adrenoceptors have only a minor role in the mediation of left atrial and ventricular inotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline. Catecholamine-evoked tachycardia is not controlled by PDE3 or PDE4. PDE4, but not PDE3, controls the atrial inotropic and cAMP beta(1)-adrenoceptor-mediated responses to (-)-noradrenaline. Both PDE3 and PDE4 blunt left atrial inotropic and cAMP responses to (-)-adrenaline through beta(2)-adrenoceptors.
The sensitizing properties of drugs of abuse have been proposed to play an important role in the persistence of drug seeking behavior. We decided to evaluate the temporal relationship of dopamine D2 receptor-mediated drug seeking behavior and behavioral sensitization in animals with a history of cocaine and heroin self-administration. During early phases of withdrawal (<1 week), activation of dopamine D2 receptors with quinpirole resulted in robust, dose-dependent, reinstatement of (non-reinforced) responding in both cocaine- and heroin-trained rats. Cocaine and heroin seeking induced by quinpirole was associated with a dramatic enhancement of the psychomotor stimulant effects of the D2 agonist, indicating that sensitization to D2-mediated events had developed. During the late phase of withdrawal (>3 weeks), reinstatement of cocaine seeking by quinpirole was still apparent, but less robust. In heroin-trained rats, increases of responding were no longer observed. Interestingly, behavioral sensitization to quinpirole was still observed in cocaine-trained rats, but was absent in heroin-trained rats. Thus, it appears that dopamine D2 receptors have a time-dependent role in relapse to cocaine and heroin seeking which is strongly associated with a behaviorally sensitized state.
We previously reported that conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a naturally occurring fatty acid, inhibits the growth of ERalpha(+) MCF-7 and ERalpha(-) MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells by negative modulation of the ERK/MAPK pathway and apoptosis induction. Here we show that in these cell lines CLA also down-regulates the PI3K/Akt cascade. In MCF-7 cells CLA also triggers ERalpha/PP2A complex formation reducing the phosphorylation state and transcriptional activity of Eralpha whereas in MDA-MB-231 cells CLA does not induce PP2A activation. Moreover, CLA induces the expression of proteins involved in cell adhesion and inhibits cell migration and MMP-2 activity. These findings suggest that CLA may induce the down-regulation of ERalpha signalling and the reduction of cell invasion through the modulation of balancing between phosphatases and kinases.
Azelnidipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker unlike other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, does not increase but slightly decreases heart rate (HR) in clinical settings. In the present study, the mechanism for the HR-lowering action characteristic of azelnidipine was investigated in anesthetized dogs. In the in situ perfused sinus node preparation, the negative chronotropic action of azelnidipine was almost 5 times more potent than that of amlodipine. When injected intravenously in intact anesthetized dogs, both drugs produced a long-lasting blood pressure reduction, but the action of azelnidipine developed more slowly than that of amlodipine. Azelnidipine hardly affected HR at lower doses and decreased HR at higher doses. On the other hand, amlodipine consistently induced slight tachycardia. The HR-lowering effect of azelnidipine in autonomically blocked dogs was not much different from that in intact dogs, whereas tachycardia induced by amlodipine was eliminated in autonomically blocked dogs. However, neither drug affected the HR gain of baroreceptor reflex induced by changing carotid sinus pressure. These results suggest that compared with amlodipine, azelnidipine has a greater intrinsic negative chronotropic action and induces a lower level of reflex tachycardia most probably due to a slower development of blood pressure-lowering effects and that these characteristics of azelnidipine underlies its HR-lowering effects when administered systemically.
A 25-year-old woman being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was accidentally given vindesine intrathecally. The error was recognized immediately and a spinal cord washing was performed through syringing with isotonic saline. However, the patient died 6 weeks later with increasing paralysis, which was followed by neurologic failure. The deceased was autopsied and the central nervous system was removed for a microscopic examination. The results showed microscopic lesions extending from the lumbar to the thoracic portion of the spinal cord, which included pseudocystic transformation of the cells, degeneration of myelin, and microhemorrhages. The brain was edematous and, in the cerebellum, the vermis showed a loss of granule and Purkinje cells. The authors compare this report on vindesine toxicity with cases in the literature involving vincristine. The treating physician admitted responsibility and was sentenced to both a fine and imprisonment.
Administration of histamine receptor antagonists has been reported to produce contradictory results, either reducing or increasing neural damage induced by ischemia. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of histamine H2-receptor antagonists in an "in vitro" model of ischemia.
Cultured rat brain cortical neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence or absence of different histaminergic drugs. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide reduction assay. Necrosis and apoptosis were quantified by staining cells with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33258. Caspase 3 activation was determined by immunocytochemistry and Western blot.
Pretreatment with H2 antagonists effectively reduced neuronal cell death induced by OGD. Ranitidine decreased the number of necrotic and apoptotic cells. Caspase 3 activation and alteration of the neuronal cytoskeleton were also prevented by ranitidine pretreatment. The neuroprotective effect of ranitidine was still evident when added 6 hours after OGD.
H2-receptor antagonists protected against OGD-induced neuronal death. Ranitidine attenuated cell death even when administered after OGD. These data suggest that this drug, which is currently used for the treatment of gastric ulcers, may be useful in promoting recovery after ischemia.
Cyclophosphamide therapy may be associated with the subsequent development of malignacies in many organs including the urinary tract. The main site in the urinary tract for development of these malignancies is the urinary bladder. Carcinoma of the kidney associated with cyclophosphamide therapy has previously been reported only in transplant recipients. The present case describes, for the first time, the development of renal cell carcinoma after treatment with cyclophosphamide in a patient with Wegener's granulomatosis.
This study compared the activity of telavancin, a novel multivalent lipoglycopeptide with rapid bactericidal activity, with those of five standard antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) against isolates of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA).
Microdilution tests performed according to CLSI guidelines using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth were used to determine the MIC values of telavancin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, linezolid and daptomycin versus 60 CA-MRSA isolates. MBC values of telavancin were determined according to CLSI guidelines and American Society for Microbiology standards. PFGE was performed using the restriction enzyme SmaI. Samples from three predominant pulsed-field types were typed by multilocus sequence typing. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec typing was determined by multiplex PCR. The Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) genes (lukS-PV and lukF-PV) were identified by PCR.
The telavancin MIC90 and MBC90 values for this collection of 60 CA-MRSA isolates were 0.5 and 1 mg/L, respectively, with MIC and MBC values both ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/L. Telavancin was found to be bactericidal in this study, as its MBC was no more than 2-fold higher than its MIC for all CA-MRSA isolates tested except one. (A single isolate yielded an MBC/MIC ratio of 4.) PVL- and non-PVL-producing strains demonstrated similar susceptibility to telavancin and comparator agents.
Based on in vitro activity, telavancin should be an effective agent against CA-MRSA.
A group of 20 children was assessed for possible effects at school age of prenatal exposure to methadone. Compared to a control group of 20 nonexposed children on measures of cognitive, social, and emotional development, and of achievement, no significant differences were found on cognitive tests, although methadone exposure was associated with lower IQ scores. Methadone-exposed children exhibited greater anxiety, aggression, and rejection than did those in the control group, and their mothers reported more behavior problems.
The Testin (TES) gene was previously identified as a putative human tumor suppressor gene at 7q31.2, a region that is frequently deleted in hematopoietic malignancies, as well as in epithelial tumors. To determine whether TES acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo, we generated a Tes knockout mouse and then used it in an established model of carcinogen-induced gastric cancer. In mice a zinc-deficient (ZD) diet enhances cellular proliferation in the forestomach and susceptibility to N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced carcinogenesis. Five-week-old Tes wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), and homozygous (-/-) mice were divided into four groups: mice fed a zinc-sufficient diet (ZS); mice fed a ZD diet; ZS fed plus NMBA-treated mice (ZS+NMBA), and ZD fed plus NMBA-treated mice (ZD+NMBA). After 4 weeks, the ZS+NMBA and ZD+NMBA groups were treated with three intragastric doses of NMBA. Animals were killed 8 weeks after NMBA administration: 25% of +/+ mice developed benign lesions; 88% of +/- showed multiple papillomas, atypical glandular metaplasia, and squamous cell carcinomasl; and 81% of -/- mice displayed very large papillomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and adenocarcinomas. A statistically significant difference in tumor incidence was found between +/- versus +/+ and -/- versus +/+ (P < 0.0001). These data suggest that Tes functions as a tumor suppressor gene in vivo.
Treatment of human stomach cancer KATO III cells with hot-water extracts from adzuki beans led to their growth inhibition as well as apoptosis induction. There are morphological changes in the cultured cells treated with the extracts, by which DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis was actualized both concentration- and time-dependently. In contrast, N-acetyl-L-cysteine suppressed such DNA fragmentation, implying that the extracts from adzuki beans might exert antitumorigenicity via active oxygen-induced apoptosis. In order to verify this hypothesis in animal experiment, the 40% ethanol fraction of hot-water extracts was examined for its preventive effect against benzo(a)pyrene-induced tumorigenesis in the forestomach of A/J mice, given as drinking water containing the above fraction at 0.5-2.0% levels. Consequently, forestomach cancer has turned out to be reduced by 36-62% in tumor weight relative to the control. These results suggest that the fraction of hot-water adzuki extracts may serve as a nutrapharmaceutical or functional food available for cancer prevention.
We have developed a prostate carcinogenesis model in Fischer 344 rats using 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) as a carcinogen to examine various potential modifying factors. In this study, mutational changes in the ras and p53 genes were assessed in DMAB-induced rat prostate and seminal vesicle carcinomas by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and subsequent direct DNA sequencing. Eight of 22 prostate adenocarcinomas (three of nine (33.3%) from the ventral lobe and five of 13 (38.5%) from the dorsolateral lobe, including three transplantable tumors) and one of 11 seminal vesicle adenocarcinomas (9.1%) demonstrated point mutations in the Ki-ras gene. One prostate malignant fibrohistiocytoma examined was negative. Among the positive cases, five (three ventral prostate carcinomas and two transplantable tumors) also showed loss of the normal allele. In contrast, other than one mutation in the p53 gene in the malignant fibrohistiocytoma, there were no mutations in the Ha-ras or p53 genes. These results indicate that mutational activation of the Ki-ras gene, but not of the Ha-ras or p53 genes may play a mechanistic role in prostate and seminal vesicle carcinogenesis by DMAB and that a loss of the normal allele of the Ki-ras gene may also be involved in the process.
Diabetic neuropathic pain, an important microvascular complication in diabetes mellitus, is recognised as one of the most difficult types of pain to treat. A lack of understanding of its aetiology, inadequate relief, development of tolerance and potential toxicity of classical antinociceptives warrant the investigation of newer agents to relieve this pain. The aim of the present study was to explore the antinociceptive effect and possible mechanism of action of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Four weeks after a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg), mice were tested in the tail-immersion and hot-plate assays. Diabetic mice exhibited significant hyperalgesia compared with control mice. Fluoxetine (10 and 20, but not 5 mg/kg, i.p.) injected into diabetic mice produced an antinociceptive effect in both the tail-immersion and hot-plate assays. The percentage maximum possible effect (% MPE) produced by fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was significantly lower in diabetic mice than in control mice. The antinociceptive effect of fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) in diabetic mice was dose-dependently potentiated by pindolol (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p., a selective 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor antagonist), attenuated by ritanserin (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p., a selective 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist) and remained unaffected by ondansetron (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p., a selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist) in both test systems. These results suggest that fluoxetine-induced antinociception primarily involves serotonin pathway modulation through 5-HT(1) and 5-HT(2) receptors, but not through 5-HT(3) receptors, in the chronic pain associated with streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy. Further, the potentiation of the antinociceptive effect of fluoxetine by pindolol indicates the usefulness of a combination of an antidepressant and a 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor antagonist in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain in humans.
Three cocaine abusers who had been abstinent for one to six months relapsed to cocaine use soon after beginning desipramine hydrochloride therapy. The antidepressant treatment was begun for different reasons in each case. All three patients developed what has been termed the early tricyclic jitteriness syndrome. This reaction may have stimulated conditioned craving for cocaine because of the similarity between this syndrome and cocaine intoxication. Since desipramine is being used to reduce cocaine craving, it is important to recognize this paradoxical increase in craving as a potential adverse effect of desipramine.
Stimulant-dependent subjects show dysfunctions in decision-making similar to those seen in subjects with ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions. Studies of drug craving, reward association, and decision-making have implicated dysfunctions of the dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortex as a key neural substrate in subjects with stimulant dependence. Here, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was carried out to determine the relationship between decision-making dysfunction and neural activation in different prefrontal areas. This investigation tested the behavioral hypothesis that methamphetamine-dependent subjects in early sustained remission show decision-making dysfunctions that are consistent with an increased reliance on stimulus-contingent response selection. It was hypothesized that these decision-making dysfunctions are due to differences in task-related activation in the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Ten methamphetamine-dependent subjects were compared with ten age- and education-matched controls performing a two-choice prediction task and a two-choice response task during a fMRI session. Response bias, latency, and mutual information measures assessing the underlying strategies of the decision-making sequences were obtained. First, methamphetamine-dependent subjects were more influenced by the immediately preceding outcome during the two-choice prediction task relative to normal comparison subjects. Second, methamphetamine-dependent subjects activated less dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9) and failed to activate ventromedial cortex (BA 10,11) during the two-choice prediction task compared with the two-choice response task. These results support the basic hypothesis that stimulant-dependent subjects exhibit fundamental cognitive deficits during decision-making that are consistent with both orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal dysfunction.
Anthracyclines are antineoplastic agents that are effective against solid tumors and hematological malignancies. However, drug-induced cardiotoxicity imposes dose limitations. Myocardial damage due to anthracyclines has been assessed by measuring left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or fraction shortening (FS) by echocardiography and criteria for discontinuing treatment have been established based on these indexes. However, cardiotoxicity is already irreversible when either LVEF or FS fulfills these criteria. The Tei-index has recently been established to assess combined systolic and diastolic myocardial function during echocardiography. It can also detect small changes in cardiac function. We therefore surmised that the Tei-index would reflect early myocardial damage induced by anthracyclines. We treated 23 patients with the anthracycline, doxorubicin (DXR), and examined them at least twice during the treatment. An additional dose of DXR significantly correlated with a change in the Tei-index (DeltaTei-index). In contrast, a change in LVEF did not correlate with increased doses of DXR. The DeltaTei-index did not correlate with either LVEF or the Tei-index before treatment. These results suggested that the DeltaTei-index is a more sensitive indicator of early cardiotoxicity induced by anthracyclines than LVEF regardless of its value before treatment.
The role of serotonin 5-HT(2) receptors (5-HT(2)R) in the hyperactivity induced by (+)-3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine ((+)-MDMA; 3 mg/kg) was investigated. Hyperactivity induced by (+)-MDMA was robustly potentiated by the 5-HT(2B/2C)R antagonist SB 206553 (1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/kg). Administration of the 5-HT(1B/1D)R antagonist GR 127935 (2.5 mg/kg) or the 5-HT(2A)R antagonist M100907 (1.0 mg/kg) partially suppressed the potentiated hyperactivity seen following SB 206553 plus (+)-MDMA; a blockade to activity levels seen with (+)-MDMA alone was observed following the combination of GR 127935 plus M100907. A modest potentiative interaction was seen when SB 206553 was combined with the DA releaser amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg) or amphetamine plus the 5-HT releaser fenfluramine (4.0 mg/kg). SB 206553 (1-4 mg/kg), GR 127935 (2.5 mg/kg) and M100907 (1 mg/kg) did not alter spontaneous activity upon administration singly or in combination. These data suggest that activation of 5-HT(2C)R exerts a strong inhibitory influence on the hyperactivity induced by (+)-MDMA, and that 5-HT(2C)R blockade unmasks hyperactivity mediated through several mechanisms.
A single injection of the new GABA receptor agonist SL 76 002 reduces the activity of striatal cholinergic neurons. Behaviorally, SL 76 002 (in large dose) potentiates haloperidol-induced catalepsy and antagonizes apomorphine-induced stereotypies. Repeated coadministration of haloperidol and SL 76 002 for 10 days does not affect the tolerance of the cholinergic system which is observed after haloperidol alone. In contrast, coadministration of the two drugs results in a marked prevention of the tolerance to the cataleptogenic action of haloperidol and of the increased sensitivity to apomorphine. It is suggested that (a) GABA mimetic medication inhibits striatal cholinergic transmission by a direct action on ACh cells; (b) behavioral effects resulting from alteration of dopaminergic transmission are--in contrast to the current view--not exclusively mediated by changes of cholinergic activity; (c) GABA affects striatal function via at least two mechanisms: by a direct input on, and independently from, both dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons; and (d) SL 76 002 possibly exerts a beneficial action in L-DOPA-induced abnormal movements in parkinsonian patients and neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesias.
Induced microseizures (IMS) were observed in a 5-month-old girl with symptomatic West syndrome. The seizures occurred following the suppression of infantile spasms with adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy and disappeared following the cessation of clonazepam administration. The ictal manifestations consisted of periods of irregular respiration, and respiratory arrest lasting for several seconds which often involved opening of the eyes and mild extension of the neck corresponding with the diffuse fast wave bursts in EEG activity observed during sleep. These seizures were thought to be equivalent to the IMS in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which have never been reported before in patients with West syndrome.
OraVerse, an injectable formulation of phentolamine mesylate (PM), was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for reversal of anesthesia of the lip and tongue and associated functional deficits resulting from an intraoral submucosal injection of a local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor. Because PM had not been approved previously for submucosal administration, 2 Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) studies in dogs designed to investigate systemic toxicity and the local effects of single and repeated dosing of OraVerse on the inferior alveolar nerve and branches of the superior alveolar nerve and adjacent soft tissues after local administration were conducted. Systemic toxicity was measured by preinjection and postinjection clinical examinations, clinical chemistry, and gross and microscopic examinations of major organs after necropsy. No evidence of systemic toxicity was detected. Local nerve and adjacent tissue damage was assessed by conventional histopathology. Nerve degeneration was evident in 1 animal. Mild perineural inflammation adjacent to the inferior alveolar nerve and inflammatory exudates were observed in submucosal tissues in several animals. No changes were observed in the nerves at injection sites of dogs from any dose group that were considered directly related to the test articles. These data reveal that single and repeated intraoral administrations of OraVerse are well tolerated in beagle dogs.
The frequency and severity of 17 side effects presumably associated with stimulant medication were assessed during a rigorous, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover evaluation of methylphenidate, 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg twice a day, in 83 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Side effects were rated by parents and teachers at the end of each weekly drug condition. Three children (3.6%) had side effects that were sufficiently serious to warrant immediate discontinuation of medication. Parent ratings indicated that only the side effects of decreased appetite, insomnia, stomachaches, and headaches increased significantly in frequency and severity during the two active medication doses as compared with the placebo condition. Fewer than half of the children experienced these side effects and among those who did, ratings of mean severity remained in the mild range. Teacher ratings showed little change over drug conditions, except on ratings of staring, sadness, and anxiety, which declined with increasing dose of medication. Parent ratings indicated that only the side effects of decreased appetite, insomnia, stomachaches, and headaches increased significantly in frequency and severity during the two active medication doses as compared with the placebo condition. Fewer than half of the children experienced these side effects and among those who did, ratings of mean severity remained in the mild range. Teacher ratings showed little change over drug conditions, except on ratings of staring, sadness, and anxiety, which declined with increasing dose of medication. Surprisingly, a high frequency of these behavior side effects were reported during the placebo condition. Stimulant medication within this therapeutic range, therefore, results in few, generally mild side effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
In view of extensive uses of lambda-cyhalothrin, a new generation type II synthetic pyrethroid, human exposure is quite imminent. The present study has therefore been carried out to investigate effect of lambda-cyhalothrin on brain dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and functional alterations associated with them. Post-lactational exposure to lambda-cyhalothrin (1.0 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) from PD22 to PD49 caused a significant decrease in the motor activity and rota-rod performance in rats on PD50 as compared to controls. Decrease in motor activity in lambda-cyhalothrin treated rats was found to persist 15 days after withdrawal of exposure on PD65 while a trend of recovery in rota-rod performance was observed. A decrease in the binding of ³H-Spiperone, known to label dopamine-D2 receptors in corpus striatum associated with decreased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactivity and TH protein was observed in lambda-cyhalothrin treated rats on PD50 and PD65 compared to controls. Increase in the binding of ³H-Ketanserin, known to label serotonin-2A receptors in frontal cortex was observed in lambda-cyhalothrin exposed rats on PD50 and PD65 as compared to respective controls. The changes were more marked in rats exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin at a higher dose (3.0 mg/kg) and persisted even 15 days after withdrawal of exposure. The results exhibit vulnerability of developing rats to lambda-cyhalothrin and suggest that striatal dopaminergic system is a target of lambda-cyhalothrin. Involvement of serotonin-2A receptors in the neurotoxicity of lambda-cyhalothrin is also suggested. The results further indicate that neurobehavioral changes may be more intense in case exposure to lambda-cyhalothrin continues.
We report the findings in a patient with a midbasilar artery stenosis in whom reversible ischemic neurologic deficits developed during cerebral blood flow imaging with acetazolamide challenge. The potential for ischemic complications from acetazolamide challenge is discussed.
