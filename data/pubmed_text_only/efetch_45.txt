To examine the allelic variation of three enzymes involved in 6-mercaptopurine/azathioprine (6-MP/AZA) metabolism and evaluate the influence of these polymorphisms on toxicity, haematological parameters and metabolite levels in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Clinical data and blood samples were collected from 19 ALL paediatric patients and 35 IBD patients who were receiving 6-MP/AZA therapy. All patients were screened for seven genetic polymorphisms in three enzymes involved in mercaptopurine metabolism [xanthine oxidase, inosine triphosphatase (C94-->A and IVS2+21A-->C) and thiopurine methyltransferase]. Erythrocyte and plasma metabolite concentrations were also determined. The associations between the various genotypes and myelotoxicity, haematological parameters and metabolite concentrations were determined.
Thiopurine methyltransferase variant alleles were associated with a preferential metabolism away from 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (P = 0.008 in ALL patients, P = 0.038 in IBD patients) favouring 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs) (P = 0.021 in ALL patients). Interestingly, carriers of inosine triphosphatase IVS2+21A-->C variants among ALL and IBD patients had significantly higher concentrations of the active cytotoxic metabolites, 6-TGNs (P = 0.008 in ALL patients, P = 0.047 in IBD patients). The study confirmed the association of thiopurine methyltransferase heterozygosity with leucopenia and neutropenia in ALL patients and reported a significant association between inosine triphosphatase IVS2+21A-->C variants with thrombocytopenia (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS; Pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in the 6-MP pathway may help identify patients at risk for associated toxicities and may serve as a guide for dose individualization.
Torsade de pointes represents a potential complication of chronic amiodarone therapy. Several reports have emphasized the need for a loading dose in order to achieve therapeutic blood levels rapidly. We report a case of torsade de pointes following a single oral dose of amiodarone (1400 mg or 30 mg kg-1) administered after short intravenous loading for prevention of paroxysmal atrial flutter. Torsades de pointes were preceded and associated with marked QT prolongation and bradycardia. This report suggests that careful monitoring of patients undergoing oral amiodarone loading is necessary.
A wide range of motor fluctuations develop in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients after prolonged levodopa (L-dopa) treatment, but few experimental models exist in which these can be investigated. We report on motor fluctuations occurring in MPTP-treated common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) treated repeatedly with L-dopa. All animals showed an improvement in motor function in response to L-dopa, and rapidly developed peak-dose dyskinesia. During the period of L-dopa action, brief periods of immobility were occasionally observed. After acute L-dopa challenge, animals exhibited a worsening of motor function before improvement, and after the beneficial response to L-dopa declined, motor performance showed rebound worsening to below-baseline values. Before L-dopa challenge and during wearing-off and rebound worsening, leg dystonias were observed. Although these findings cannot necessarily be generalized to all MPTP-treated nonhuman primates, they demonstrate that MPTP-treated marmosets show a range of different motor fluctuations analogous to those seen in PD patients chronically treated with L-dopa. Therefore, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated primates can provide a model in which the pathophysiology of treatment complications can be investigated.
The effects of prenatal cocaine use on quality of maternal-infant interactions were evaluated using the Nursing Child Assessment Feeding Scale (NCAFS). A total of 341 (155 cocaine using; 186 non-cocaine using) low socioeconomic, primarily African-American dyads were evaluated longitudinally at birth, 6.5, and 12 months. Group differences over time were examined, controlling for covariates, using a mixed-model linear approach. Women who used cocaine during pregnancy were less sensitive to their infants than non-cocaine-using women at 6.5 and 12 months. At 6.5 months, heavier prenatal cocaine users were less responsive to their infants than lighter users. In infants, prenatal cocaine exposure was related to poorer clarity of cues. There were no significant cocaine effects on maternal social-emotional growth fostering, cognitive growth fostering, or infant responsiveness to mother. Controlling for covariates, concentration of cocaine metabolites predicted maternal sensitivity to infant cues and infant clarity of cues at 1 year. Maternal cocaine use during pregnancy and other pre- and postnatal factors adversely affect maternal-infant interactions during the first year of life.
In the following study the condition of the spiral ganglion and the cochlear nerve of ears from patients suffering from profound hearing loss is described. The number of spiral ganglion cells has been related to the clinical diagnosis. The number of spiral ganglion cells in the two temporal bones of a patient with Neomycin ototoxicity was almost normal. A reduction of less than one-third of spiral ganglion cells has been observed in the temporal bones of a child who died after a bacterial labyrinthitis. The temporal bone with a Mondini dysplasia revealed a pronounced reduction of ganglion cells of more than two-thirds. The cochlear nerve trunk in the internal auditory canal appeared normal in all three cases. The present findings are discussed in respect to the degenerative behaviour of the cochlear neural elements in human being compared to animals.
Cocaine and its principal metabolite, benzoyl ecgonine, were isolated from the urine of four hospitalized children who had been exposed to the smoke of freebase cocaine ("crack") used by their adult caretakers. Two of the children had transient neurological symptoms (drowsiness and unsteady gait) and two had seizures whose cause could not be determined by laboratory investigation. Passive cocaine inhalation may have caused or contributed to these symptoms. Children in the care of adults who abuse freebase cocaine should be considered at risk not only for disruption of their social environment but also for the effects of cocaine toxicity.
The pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) presumptively is due to an inappropriate intestinal epithelial immunologic response of immature gut to luminal stimuli. Glutamine is essential for intestinal crypt cell proliferation and enhances the cellular response to growth factors. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the supplementation of enteral feedings with glutamine may stimulate an immature intestine and decrease the intestinal inflammatory change in NEC. Immediately after birth, the neonatal rats were weighed and randomized into one of four treatment groups. Group 1 consisted of rats whom were breast-fed. Group 2 (NEC group) consisted of neonates whom were fed with a special rodent formula. Rats in groups 3 and 4 were fed in a similar fashion to those in group 2, and glutamine 0.3 mg/kg per day and dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg per day were added to their formula, respectively. The neonatal rats were weighed and killed on day 4: the last 4 cm of terminal ileum was harvested for morphological studies and detection of nitrite and nitrate levels in tissue. The animals in the NEC group showed various degrees of inflammatory changes similar to clinical NEC. The inflammatory changes of the intestine appeared to be attenuated in both glutamine- and steroid-treated animals compared to those in the NEC group. Only steroid treatment decreased the tissue levels of these nitrogen oxides that were increased in rats in the NEC group. We herein provide evidence that maturational agents such as glutamine and dexametasone can attenuate the local intestinal inflammatory damage in experimental NEC. These findings support the hypothesis that the gut immaturity in premature infants represents a risk factor for NEC.
This investigation was conducted to evaluate whether poloxamer 407 (P-407), a nonionic surface-active-agent that functions as a lipase inhibitor, could aid in weight loss by inactivating pancreatic lipase (PL) following oral administration to mice. Using a pH-titrimetric method, P-407 was evaluated for its ability to inhibit PL activity in-vitro. The palatability of drinking water containing P-407 (50 microM) was assessed in mice to determine whether inclusion of P-407 altered either the volume of water ingested, or the volume of urine produced, per day. P-407 at the same concentration was next evaluated for its potential to mediate weight loss over a one-month period in mice fed a high-fat diet. Faecal fat determinations and the potential for P-407 to lower plasma triacylglycerol concentrations following oral administration of a standard lipid emulsion were also conducted. P-407 was determined to have an IC50 of 15.9 microM in-vitro. Inclusion of P-407 in drinking water neither perturbed the daily volume of water ingested, nor the volume of urine produced. Over the course of one month, adult mice, which were fed the high-fat diet and treated with P-407, lost approximately 12.4+/-1.7% of their initial body weight, whereas, control mice fed the identical diet continued to slowly gain weight (7.3+/-0.5% of their initial body weight). The amount of total lipids excreted in the faeces of high-fat-fed, P-407-treated mice was approximately 45% greater than that observed for control mice eating the same diet. Lastly, plasma triacylglycerol concentrations following oral administration of the standard lipid emulsion containing P-407 were significantly lower than corresponding plasma triacylglycerol concentrations observed in mice administered the lipid emulsion alone. While not as potent as orlistat, P-407 may potentially represent an additional treatment strategy for weight loss, especially when combined with caloric restriction, regular exercise, and anti-obesity medications of other drug classes.
Interleukin-1 beta (IL1β) is a proinflammatory cytokine that mediates arthritic pathologies. Our objectives were to evaluate pain and limb dysfunction resulting from IL1β over-expression in the rat knee and to investigate the ability of local IL1 receptor antagonist (IL1Ra) delivery to reverse-associated pathology. IL1β over-expression was induced in the right knees of 30 Wistar rats via intra-articular injection of rat fibroblasts retrovirally infected with human IL1β cDNA. A subset of animals received a 30 µl intra-articular injection of saline or human IL1Ra on day 1 after cell delivery (0.65 µg/µl hIL1Ra, n = 7 per group). Joint swelling, gait, and sensitivity were investigated over 1 week. On day 8, animals were sacrificed and joints were collected for histological evaluation. Joint inflammation and elevated levels of endogenous IL1β were observed in knees receiving IL1β-infected fibroblasts. Asymmetric gaits favoring the affected limb and heightened mechanical sensitivity (allodynia) reflected a unilateral pathology. Histopathology revealed cartilage loss on the femoral groove and condyle of affected joints. Intra-articular IL1Ra injection failed to restore gait and sensitivity to preoperative levels and did not reduce cartilage degeneration observed in histopathology. Joint swelling and degeneration subsequent to IL1β over-expression is associated limb hypersensitivity and gait compensation. Intra-articular IL1Ra delivery did not result in marked improvement for this model; this may be driven by rapid clearance of administered IL1Ra from the joint space. These results motivate work to further investigate the behavioral consequences of monoarticular arthritis and sustained release drug delivery strategies for the joint space.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare immune-mediated complication of heparin administration. A potentially life-threatening complication, HIT is difficult to diagnose in patients in the intensive care unit after cardiac surgery because there can be multiple reasons for thrombocytopenia. Moreover, immune-mediated platelet consumption may be masked by reactive thrombocytosis, which is common in the typical postoperative course after cardiac surgery. We report the case of a 57-year-old male patient who developed fulminant pulmonary embolism following heparin-induced thrombosis without thrombocytopenia after off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.
1 Stress is a risk factor in psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different circulating levels of the adrenal steroid corticosterone (CORT) on locomotor hyperactivity and prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle, two behavioural animal models of aspects of schizophrenia. 2 Male C57BL/6J mice (n=10 per group) were anaesthetised with isoflurane and sham-operated or adrenalectomised (ADX). ADX mice were implanted with 50 mg pellets consisting of 100% cholesterol, or 2, 10 or 50 mg of CORT mixed with cholesterol. CORT pellet implantation dose dependently increased plasma CORT levels 3 weeks after surgery. Starting 1 week after surgery, mice were tested for prepulse inhibition after injection of saline or 5 mg kg(-1) of haloperidol. 3 In intact mice and in mice implanted with 10 mg of CORT, haloperidol treatment significantly increased prepulse inhibition (average values from 38 - 42 to 52%). Similar results were observed when testing the mice for amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity (5 mg kg(-1)). In contrast, there was no significant effect of haloperidol in mice implanted either with cholesterol or 2 or 50 mg of CORT. 4 These results in behavioural animal models of schizophrenia suggest an important role of the stress hormone CORT in modulating dopaminergic activity in this illness.
Carvedilol is a beta-adrenoceptor blocker with a vasodilatory action that is more effective for the treatment of congestive heart failure than other beta-blockers. Recently, carvedilol has been reported to reduce oxidative stress, which may consequently reduce the deactivation of adenosine-producing enzymes and increase cardiac adenosine levels. Therefore, carvedilol may also have a protective effect on ischemia and reperfusion injury, because adenosine mediates cardioprotection in ischemic hearts.
In anesthetized dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 90 minutes, followed by reperfusion for 6 hours. Carvedilol reduced the infarct size (15.0+/-2.8% versus 40.9+/-4.2% in controls), and this effect was completely reversed by the nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (45.2+/-5.4%) or by an inhibitor of ecto-5'-nucleotidase (44.4+/-3.6%). There were no differences of either area at risk or collateral flow among the various groups. When the coronary perfusion pressure was reduced in other dogs so that coronary blood flow was decreased to 50% of the nonischemic level, carvedilol increased coronary blood flow (49.4+/-5.6 to 73.5+/-7.5 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1); P<0.05) and adenosine release (112.3+/-22.2 to 240.6+/-57.1 nmol/L; P<0.05) during coronary hypoperfusion. This increase of coronary blood flow was attenuated by either 8-sulfophenyltheophylline or superoxide dismutase. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured with or without xanthine and xanthine oxidase, carvedilol caused an increase of ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity.
Carvedilol shows a cardioprotective effect against ischemia and/or reperfusion injury via adenosine-dependent mechanisms.
The incidence of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix associated with intrauterine exposure to DES and similar compounds during the first half of pregnancy has increased. Ninety percent of these cancers have occurred in patients 14 years of age or older. Although these carcinomas are exceedingly rare, nonneoplastic abnormalities including vaginal adenosis, cervical eversion (ectropion), and transverse cervical and vaginal ridges are frequent in the exposed population, particularly if the drug was administered early in pregnancy. Current evidence favors a disturbance in development of the müllerian duct as the explanation of these changes. Whether DES is only a teratogen or also a carcinogen is unknown, as is the possible role of other factors in the development of cancer. An increased incidence of cancer among exposed males has not been documented.
We describe the case of a 14-year-old boy who developed airway obstruction due to acute upper respiratory tract infection. Following emergency tracheostomy, he developed pulmonary oedema and required ventilation. The postoperative course was complicated by the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome, characterised by marked respiratory distress, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography, reduced pulmonary compliance and marked increase in alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. He also developed persistent high-grade pyrexia, renal failure and cardiac instability. A social history of substance abuse (crack cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol and cigarettes) was obtained three weeks post-admission and is thought to have made a significant contribution to the severity of his disease.
Many clinical studies have shown that daily intake of soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr., Fabacease] or its foods may reduce the risk of osteoporosis, heart attack, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular and chronic renal diseases, and cancers, including prostate, colon, and breast cancers. Of the soy constituents, soyasaponins exhibit anti-aging, antioxidant, apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of soyasaponin Ab has not been thoroughly studied. Therefore, we investigated its anti-inflammatory effects in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitic mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. Soyasaponin Ab inhibited colon shortening, myeloperoxidase activity, the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Soyasaponin Ab (1, 2, 5, and 10 μM) inhibited the production of NO (IC(50) = 1.6 ± 0.1 μM) and prostaglandin E(2) (IC(50) = 2.0 ± 0.1 ng/mL), the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (IC(50) = 1.3 ± 0.1 ng/mL), interleukin (IL)-1β (IC(50) = 1.5 ± 0.1 pg/mL), and toll-like receptor (TLR)4, and the phosphorylation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. Soyasaponin Ab weakly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38. Soyasaponin Ab significantly reduced the binding of Alexa-Fluor-594-conjugated LPS to peritoneal macrophages. Soyasaponin Ab did not affect TLR4 expression or LPS-induced NF-κB activation in TLR4 siRNA-treated peritoneal macrophages (knockdown efficiency of TLR4 > 94%). On the basis of these findings, soyasaponin Ab may ameliorate colitis by inhibiting the binding of LPS to TLR4 on macrophages.
We previously demonstrated that 7-hydroxyl-1-methylindole-3-acetonitrile (7-HMIA), a synthesized analog of arvelexin, showed the strong inhibitory effects on LPS-induced NO and PGE2 production in macrophages. In this study, we focused on elucidating the anti-inflammatory properties of 7-HMIA and the mechanisms involved using in vitro and in vivo experimental models. In LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages, 7-HMIA significantly inhibited the release of proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). We also found that 7-HMIA suppressed PGE2 production not by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression or activity, but rather by suppressing the mRNA stability of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1). Furthermore, 7-HMIA mediated attenuation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), TNF-α, and IL-6 was closely associated with suppression of transcriptional activities of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), by decreasing p65 nuclear translocation and Akt phosphorylation. Animal studies revealed that 7-HMIA potently suppressed the carrageenan-induced paw edema and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in paw tissues. Taken together, our data indicated that the molecular basis for the anti-inflammatory properties of 7-HMIA involved the inhibition of mRNA stability of mPGES-1 and PI3K/Akt-mediated NF-κB pathways.
To describe a case of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) probably related to administration of diltiazem.
A 53-year-old white man presented to the hospital experiencing abdominal pain radiating to both renal fossae, as well as dysuria. Diltiazem and atenolol had been prescribed to treat an episode of precordial pain associated with effort. An erythematous maculopapular rash developed approximately 2 hours after administration of a single dose of diltiazem, and acute renal failure, associated with elevated liver function test results, developed 6 days later.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the third reported case of acute renal failure believed to be induced by diltiazem. In all cases, there was an obvious temporal relationship between administration of diltiazem and the onset of acute renal failure. Previous reports failed to discuss a probable pathogenic mechanism. AIN is the most likely etiology of acute renal failure in our patient. Favorable resolution with no relapse, the presence of the skin rash, and the liver sequelae suggest a common immunoallergic mechanism.
Healthcare professionals should consider diltiazem-induced AIN in the differential diagnosis of a patient taking diltiazem who develops acute renal failure.
This case report was with regard to familial heparin cofactor II (HC II) deficiency. The patient was a 14-years-old female, having complaints of chest pain, fever and swelling of right lower extremity. Echocardiography and DSA showed a pediculated mass at the right ventricular outflow tract which highly suggested a ventricular myxoma. At surgery, a large pediculated thrombus was removed from the RV conus septum aun pulmonary valve. The mass was identified as thrombus by histological examination. Two months later, the RV thrombi recurred with additional pulmonary embolus to the left lung. HC II was discovered by hemo-coagulation tests. Her HC II antigen value was 48%, and 32% on repeat study. Her brother's HC II antigen value was 53%. At reoperation, small thrombi less than phi 10 mm, were removed from the RV outflow tract and pulmonary valve. Fresh frozen plasma was given and intravenous urokinase therapy was taken. She is doing well with therapy of oral warfarin, aspirin and ticlopidine for anticoagulation.
Abrupt clozapine withdrawal can cause rebound psychosis and severe somatic symptoms in psychiatric patients. We report on the case of an advanced Parkinson's disease patient who developed myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, hyperreflexia, and stupor after abrupt clozapine withdrawal. The patient's symptoms resolved with treatment with cyproheptadine. This clinical picture suggests serotonergic rebound as an explanation for the patient's symptoms, although other pharmacological mechanisms are possible. Clozapine should be gradually withdrawn over a period of 1 to 2 weeks when possible, and abruptly discontinued only when necessary.
Survival rates of hepatitis B patients after liver transplantation improved significantly by introduction of passive immunoprophylaxis. Due to viral escape mutations recurrence still occurs, but recently a combination prophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobuline plus lamivudine is evaluated in transplant centers in terms of a further reduction of recurrence rates.
Between 1996 and 2000 a postoperative combination prophylaxis with HBIg and lamivudine was initiated in 44 HBsAg positive liver transplant recipients. In total 14 patients were HBV-DNA negative and 30 were HBV-DNA positive at the time of evaluation. In 22 HBV-DNA positive patients a pre-operative lamivudine treatment (150 mg/die) was started. Five of them developed pre-transplant lamivudine resistance with high viral replication (mean HBV-DNA prior to transplantation 728 +/- 219 pg/ml). In all patients passive immunoprophylaxis was started in the anhepatic phase with application of 10.000 units hepatitis B immunoglobuline. It was continued after seroconversion to HBsAg negativity with an aimed titer of more than 100 U/l and only stopped in case of HBV recurrence. Lamivudine was also continued indefinitely after liver transplantation.
Overall recurrence rate in the 44 patients, including retransplantations and patients with pretransplant lamivudine resistance, was 11.5 % under combination prophylaxis. Recurrence was seen only in one of 39 patients (2.6 %) without preoperative lamivudine resistance, in contrast 4 out of 5 patients (80 %) with pre-existing lamivudine resistance suffered from early hepatitis B recurrence. The single patient without preoperative lamivudine resistance, who developed recurrence was pre-transplant HBV-DNA negative without lamivudine treatment, but a postoperative seroconversion to negative HBsAg could not be achieved. The overall 3 year patient survival rate was 91 % in the study population. One patient, who was retransplanted with preoperative lamivudine resistance, died 4.5 months after retransplantation due to hepatitis B recurrence and sepsis, three other patients died for reasons not related to hepatitis B recurrence. Combination prophylaxis was well tolerated in all patients and no severe side effects were observed.
Combination prophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and lamivudine is safe and highly effective in prevention of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation, even in case of positive viral replication. In accordance with the results of other centers it should therefore be the standard regimen. However it fails in the majority of patients with preoperative evolution of YMDD mutations, in which the optimal management has to be determined yet. To minimize preoperative resistance formation universal preoperative antiviral treatment of HBV-DNA positive patients should be replaced by individualized indication for preoperative treatment.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are key mediators of fibrogenesis, and the regulation of their activation is now viewed as an attractive target for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Here, the authors investigated the ability of sauchinone, an active lignan found in Saururus chinensis, to regulate the activation of HSCs, to prevent liver fibrosis, and to inhibit oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro. Blood biochemistry and histopathology were assessed in CCl4-induced mouse model of liver fibrosis to investigate the effects of sauchinone. In addition, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-activated LX-2 cells (a human HSC line) were used to investigate the in vitro effects of sauchinone. Sauchinone significantly inhibited liver fibrosis, as indicated by decreases in regions of hepatic degeneration, inflammatory cell infiltration, and the intensity of α-smooth muscle actin staining in mice. Sauchinone blocked the TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 and the transcript levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 as well as autophagy in HSCs. Furthermore, sauchinone inhibited oxidative stress, as assessed by stainings of 4-hydroxynonenal and nitrotyrosine: these events may have a role in its inhibitory effects on HSCs activation. Sauchinone attenuated CCl4-induced liver fibrosis and TGF-β1-induced HSCs activation, which might be, at least in part, mediated by suppressing autophagy and oxidative stress in HSCs.
1. Recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) (1 g/kg) significantly decreased the weight of ascites in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephropathy. 2. Furosemide (1-30 mg/kg) did not significantly reduce the weight of ascites in this model. 3. A combination of rHSA (1 g/kg) with furosemide (5 mg/kg) significantly decreased the weight of ascites in this model compared with furosemide alone. 4. In consideration of these results, rHSA can be a substitute for human serum albumin products prepared from human plasma in therapy for ascites or edema in furosemide-resistant nephrotic syndrome.
A mixed micelle formulation of diazepam was compared with midazolam and diazepam in propylene glycol for evidence of venous intolerance following IV injection. The overall incidence of venous morbidity was 17% for diazepam mixed micelle, 26% for midazolam and 90% for diazepam in propylene glycol. Diazepam mixed micelle is suggested as a preferable alternative to the standard formulation.
