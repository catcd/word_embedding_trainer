The case of a 56-years-old male with cholestasis associated with ticlopidine is presented. Cholestasis is an infrequent adverse effect of this drug. The patient was admitted to hospital because of jaundice, choluria, and itching of one month of evolution. The patient had taken ticlopidine twice a day for 3 months up to one week prior to admission for peripheral arteriopathy. Biopsy was performed showing acinar cholestasis and portal inflammatory infiltrate compatible with cholestasis due to hypersensitivity. Ticlopidine was discontinued by the patient himself one week prior to admission. The drug was not readministered and the evolution of the clinical and biochemical parameters of cholestasis decreased. The patient was asymptomatic and laboratory data were normal 4 months later.
Previous studies have indicated that a subset of cancer patients treated with chemotherapy show cognitive deficits and/or experience cognitive complaints, whereas literature about the influence of hormonal therapies on cognition is sparse. Because of the accumulating knowledge about the importance of estrogen for cognitive functioning, there is growing concern about adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast cancer (BC) affecting cognition. We examined the cognitive functioning of postmenopausal BC patients who were, following doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy, randomized to tamoxifen or exemestane, and compared their performance with that of non-cancer controls.
Thirty BC patients using tamoxifen and 50 patients using exemestane underwent interviews, questionnaires and cognitive tests, on average two years after completion of AC chemotherapy. Forty eight healthy controls were tested with similar measures.
Memory complaints were reported by 28% of AC/tamoxifen users, 24% of AC/exemestane users and 6% of healthy controls (p=0.02). Cognitive testing revealed no statistically significant differences between tamoxifen and exemestane users, but suggested that tamoxifen use is possibly related to worse verbal functioning, while exemestane use is possibly related to slower manual motor speed. Both patient groups performed significantly worse than healthy controls on verbal fluency and information processing speed.
Our findings show that sequential treatment of AC-chemotherapy and hormonal therapy in postmenopausal, primary BC is associated with lower test scores for certain cognitive functions, and provide indications for possibly distinctive associations for different types of hormonal treatment. Future research with larger groups is recommended to obtain a more definite picture.
BTS 49465 (flosequinan), a putative selective, balanced arterial and venous vasodilator, displays positive inotropic effects in doses lower than those producing vasodilation. Thus rather than unloading the myocardium, flosequinan may increase myocardial work and oxygen consumption (MVO2), and may adversely affect the patient with myocardial ischemia or compromised coronary blood flow. This study compared the effects of flosequinan with milrinone, a mixed positive inotropic agent and vasodilator, and with nitroprusside (SNP), a standard direct-acting vasodilator, on myocardial dP/dT, MVO2, and myocardial energetics in the normal pentobartital-anesthetized dog. The effect of flosequinan on myocardial work was also evaluated in the dog with propranolol-induced heart failure (PIHF). Fifteen minutes after intraduodenal (id) administration of flosequinan (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg) to seven dogs, mean myocardial dP/dT was increased by 11%, 27%, and 54%, respectively, whereas stroke MVO2 was increased by 10%, 24%, and 47%, respectively. Doses of flosequinan greater than 0.3 mg/kg decreased left ventricular (LV) work but LV efficiency decreased in a dose-related manner. Milrinone (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg, id) increased LV dp/dt by 34%, 68%, and 104% above basal values, while increasing stroke MVO2 by 24%, 106%, and 249%, respectively (n = 7). LV work and LV efficiency decreased after each dose of milrinone. SNP (0.001, 0.003, and 0.01 mg/kg/min, intravenously) did not increase dP/dT but decreased LV work by 28%, 42%, and 46% (n = 5). In animals with PIHF, flosequinan (1 and 3 mg/kg, id) increased LV dP/dT 58% and 87% and increased LV work by 58% and 76% above control values. It was concluded that (1) flosequinan is a positive inotropic agent as well as a vasodilator; (2) in the normal animal the energy cost of positive inotropic activity is less with flosequinan than with milrinone, despite the lesser vasodilating action of the former; and (3) in the animal with a depressed myocardium, flosequinan may adversely affect myocardial work and wall tension.
A postmarketing surveillance study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of a fixed-ratio combination containing 10 mg of timolol maleate and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, administered twice daily for one month to hypertensive patients. Data on 9,037 patients were collected by 1,455 participating physicians. Mean systolic blood pressure decreased 25 mmHg and mean diastolic blood pressure declined 15 mmHg after one month of timolol-hydrochlorothiazide therapy (P less than 0.01, both comparisons). Age, race, and sex appeared to have no influence on the decrease in blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect of the drug was greater in patients with more severe hypertension. Overall, 1,453 patients experienced a total of 2,658 adverse events, the most common being fatigue, dizziness, and weakness. Treatment in 590 patients was discontinued because of adverse events.
The prevalence of thirst, subjective polyuria and related side-effects was investigated in 87 patients attending a lithium clinic and in a group of 52 controls. Thirst was surprisingly common, occurring in 67% of patients, in spite of the fact that they had been maintained on relatively low levels of lithium, and was due principally to the lithium rather than to other psychotropic drugs. Urine flow and impaired renal water absorption correlated with the serum lithium level and the length of treatment in the patients, despite the fact that few were clinically polyuric. The pattern of the results confirms previous suggestions that lithium may stimulate the thirst mechanism directly as well as via an increased renal resistance to vasopressin. The possible implications in terms of clinical response are discussed.
There is a lack of awareness of acutely presenting inborn errors of metabolism in adults, of which the X-linked urea cycle defect ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is an example, many comparatively mild mutations having been identified. In male hemizygotes clinical manifestations and age at presentation vary and depend on the mutation. In female heterozygotes the clinical spectrum depends on the extent to which the abnormal gene is expressed. Milder versions of the defect may not cause clear clinical symptoms and may remain unrecognized until the person is subjected to an unusually high nitrogen load when they develop severe hyperammonaemia. During acute episodes liver enzymes may be normal or only slightly elevated and occasionally accompanied by coagulopathy, but the key finding is hyperammonaemia. Boys with these milder forms may exhibit abnormal behaviour and be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This case illustrates how late presentation of OTC deficiency in a non-specialist centre can be difficult to differentiate from drug abuse, psychiatric illness or encephalopathy. Failure to measure blood ammonia in adults with unexplained key symptoms - particularly prolonged vomiting without diarrhoea and altered mental state/hallucinations, or to recognize the significance of elevated blood ammonia without evidence of liver decompensation can lead to delayed or missed diagnosis.
The effects of fluvastatin and bezafibrate on lipids, lipoproteins, and apoproteins (apo) were investigated in a multicenter randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. After 8 weeks of strictly controlled (computer-based assessment) dietary stabilization, patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] > or = 160 mg/dL; triglycerides < or = 300 mg/dL) were enrolled into a 6-week placebo phase. Altogether, 131 patients were randomized to receive either fluvastatin at 40 mg once daily (n = 64; mean age 53 years) or bezafibrate at 400 mg once daily (n = 67; mean age 52 years) for 12 weeks. Compliance with the diet was monitored (3-day food records) after 6 and 12 weeks. Fluvastatin led to significant reductions in LDL-C (-23%), total cholesterol (-17%), LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (-24%) and apo B (-19%). Fluvastatin significantly increased LpA-I (+8%) and apo E (+20%). Bezafibrate produced significant reductions in LDL-C (-17%), total cholesterol (-13%), LDL-C/HDL-C (-24%), triglycerides (-28%), apo B (-15%), and LpA-I (-10%) and significantly increased HDL-C (+12%), apo A-I (+9%), apo A-II (+30%), apo E (+14%), and Lp(a) (+3%). No clinically notable increases in levels of liver enzymes or creatine phosphokinase were observed with either treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated. There was a low incidence of adverse events that tended to be mild and included headache, muscular pain, angina, and dyspepsia. The frequency of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, and no significant differences in dietary behavior were observed. In conclusion, fluvastatin is a well tolerated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia. Effects of fluvastatin on LpA-I occur irrespective of changes in HDL-C.
The cost of dexrazoxane, a drug used to provide protection from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, limits its use in low-income countries. We aimed to see whether schisandrin B, an inexpensive drug, could provide protection equivalent to that provided by dexrazoxane. New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into groups and treated with saline, doxorubicin, doxorubicin + dexrazoxane, or doxorubicin + schisandrin B. Doxorubicin-induced damage and the protective effects were studied by recording the echocardiographic parameters and serum levels of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, cardiac troponin I, and brain natriuretic peptide and observing the histology and degree of apoptosis. Schisandrin B had dose-dependent effects in decreasing the magnitude of doxorubicin-induced indicators of cardiomyopathy to a degree that approximated the decrease produced by dexrazoxane treatment. Schisandrin B might be a useful, low-cost alternative drug for this application.
We report on three children aged 1 1/2, 2 and 9 1/2 years with Wilms' tumor, who developed a tender hepatomegaly and ascites associated with elevated liver enzymes, anemia and thrombocytopenia during chemotherapy. This clinical picture and liver sonography abnormality are best explained by veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver, while other causes of liver disease could not be identified. Actinomycin D dosage was 0.045 mg/kg as bolus injection in two patients and 0.075 mg/kg split over five days in a third patient. Presumable, this drug was the causative agent. VOD was observed after preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. No child had received abdominal irradiation. The authors comment on the influence of Actinomycin D as the cause for this unusual liver toxicity.
The bladder complications of 54 patients treated with oral cyclophosphamide for systemic lupus erythematosus (43) or rheumatoid arthritis (11) were reviewed. During an observation period of 241 patient years, we saw seven cases of acute hemorrhagic cystitis and two cases of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Bladder carcinoma was identified 28 and 60 months after withdrawal of the drug and resulted in the death of one patient. The late-occurring serious toxicities of cyclophosphamide should limit the use of the drug in the treatment of nonmalignant inflammatory rheumatic conditions.
To report a case of pituitary infarction attributable to long-term intranasal cocaine use.
We present the clinical findings, laboratory results, and imaging studies in a woman with hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and a palsy of cranial nerve VI, associated with cocaine-induced destruction of her nasal and paranasal structures and the anterior base of her skull.
A 55-year-old woman, a long-term cocaine abuser, presented with delirium, nausea, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, and hypotension as manifestations of adrenal insufficiency (cortisol levels <1 mg/dL before and after administration of cosyntropin). She was found to have a deficiency of adrenocorticotropic hormone (<1 pg/mL), gonadotropin deficiency (estradiol <20 pg/mL, luteinizing hormone 1.7 mIU/mL, and follicle-stimulating hormone 4.9 mIU/mL), and diabetes insipidus. She also had a palsy of right cranial nerve VI. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head demonstrated extensive destruction of the paranasal sinuses, extending into the base of the skull. Serial magnetic resonance images showed reduction of pituitary volume. Nasal biopsy specimens disclosed findings consistent with cocaine-induced ischemic necrosis.
To our knowledge, this is the first case of hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus due to prolonged intranasal cocaine abuse.
The activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease, N-acetylglucosaminidase, and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Acid protease (cathepsin D) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose, whereas activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis whether or not they survived. A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time, and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with aspartate aminotransferase, which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall. Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs, and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition.
A study has been made of changes in permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to drugs following exposure to compression-decompression. Fifty-five rats were exposed to 6.1 b (abs) air for 90 min and subsequently linearly decompressed to the ambient pressure during a period of 3 min. Thirty-five rats serving as controls were kept at the ambient pressure. Catalepsy, which is mediated through the striatal dopamine receptors, was used as a behavioral indicator for the penetration of drugs into the brain. A comparison was made between drugs that normally pass the BBB (atropine, 10 mg/kg; haloperidol, 2 mg/kg) and drugs that do not readily pass the BBB as a rule (methylatropine, 10 mg/kg; domperidone, 10-20 mg/kg). Evans blue, injected intravenously, was used for the visualization of possible changes in the BBB permeability. It was found that methylatropine significantly prevented haloperidol-induced catalepsy in decompressed rats, in comparison with control rats. However, this prevention was not so intense as that found after injection of a similar dose of atropine. Domperidone induced a weak catalepsy in decompressed rats, but failed to induce any catalepsy in control rats. Gross and fluorescence-microscopic examination revealed an increased penetration of Evans blue into the brains of the decompressed rats. It is concluded that compression-decompression exposure can induce a limited but significant breakage of the BBB, leading to an increase in the central effects of the drugs that normally display poor penetration of the BBB. The measurement of behavioral changes provided a new and relevant technique for studying the changes of BBB permeability to drugs.
Cervical cancers/CCs are one of the commonest malignancies and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Resveratrol inhibits CC cell growth but its molecular target(s) remains unclear. Since the signaling pathways mediated by STAT3, Notch1 and Wnt2 play beneficial roles in CC formation and progression, the effects of resveratrol on them in cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) and squamous cell carcinoma (SiHa) cells were analyzed. The biological significances of the above signaling for HeLa and SiHa cells were evaluated by treating the cells with STAT3, Wnt or Notch selective inhibitors. The frequencies of STAT3, Notch and Wnt activations in 68 cases of CC specimens and 38 non-cancerous cervical epithelia were examined by tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining. The results revealed that HeLa and SiHa cells treated by 100μM resveratrol showed extensive apoptosis, accompanied with suppression of STAT3, Notch and Wnt activations. Growth inhibition and apoptosis were found in HeLa and SiHa populations treated by AG490, a STAT3/JAK3 inhibitor but not the ones treated by Notch inhibitor L-685,458 or by Wnt inhibitor XAV-939. Immunohistochemical staining performed on the tissue microarrays showed that the frequencies of Notch1, Notch2, Hes1, Wnt2, Wnt5a and p-STAT3 detection as well as β-catenin nuclear translocation in CC samples were significantly higher than that of noncancerous group (p<0.01), while the expression rate of PIAS3 was remarkably low in cancer samples (p<0.01). Our results thus demonstrate that STAT3, Wnt and Notch signaling are frequently co-activated in human CC cells and specimens and resveratrol can concurrently inhibit those signaling activations and meanwhile lead cervical squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma cells to growth arrest and apoptosis. STAT3 signaling is more critical for CC cells and is the major target of resveratrol because selective inhibition of STAT3 rather than Wnt or Notch activation commits SiHa and HeLa cells to apoptosis.
The risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) is known to have a significant genetic component that could act through either the NTD patient and/or maternal genotype. The success of folic acid supplementation in NTD prevention has focused attention on polymorphisms within folate-related genes. We previously identified the 1958G>A (R653Q) polymorphism of the trifunctional enzyme MTHFD1 (methylenetetrahydrofolate-dehydrogenase, methenyltetrahydrofolate-cyclohydrolase, formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase; often referred to as 'C1 synthase') as a maternal risk for NTDs, but this association remains to be verified in a separate study to rule out a chance finding. To exclude this possibility, we genotyped an independent sample of mothers with a history of an NTD-affected pregnancy derived from the same Irish population. In this sample there was a significant excess of 1958AA homozygote mothers of NTD cases (n=245) compared to controls (n=770). The direction and magnitude of risk (odds ratio 1.49 (1.07-2.09), P=0.019) is consistent with our earlier finding. Sequencing of the MTHFD1 gene revealed that this association is not being driven by another common variant within the coding region. We have established that the MTHFD1 1958G>A polymorphism has a significant role in influencing a mother's risk of having an NTD-affected pregnancy in the Irish population.
Chloroquine phosphate is now used extensively in the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis and in some collagen diseases. The ototoxic potential of this drug during long term use was assessed in 74 patients. At a time when pure tone and speech audiometry failed to demonstrate any hearing change, brainstem audiometry became abnormal in 13 patients. Abnormalities disappeared if chloroquine was withdrawn. Pathogenesis will be discussed on the basis of data obtained from animal experiments.
A woman with primary liver cancer after nine years therapy with polyestradiol-phosphate is reported. The oestrogen was administered monthy by intramuscular injection for menopausal symptoms. This case suggests a possible association between long-term oestrogen therapy and the development of hepatic malignancy and also must direct attention to both hormone components in the evaluation of tumour development in users or oral contraceptives.
To report a case of a patient who experienced acute renal and hepatic toxicity following administration of daptomycin and review previously published case reports of renal and hepatic dysfunction with daptomycin.
A 35-year-old man receiving daptomycin 4 mg/kg (275 mg) intravenously once daily (started 5 wk prior to presentation for presumed osteomyelitis) presented to the emergency department with elevations in serum creatinine and hepatic transaminase levels. He did not experience creatine kinase (CK) elevation or rhabdomyolysis. Following discontinuation of daptomycin, his renal and hepatic function improved.
To our knowledge, this is the first case of daptomycin-induced hepatotoxicity with acute renal failure in the absence of rhabdomyolysis and CK abnormalities. Previously published case reports described patients with a variety of elevations in liver function tests, serum creatinine, and CK with daptomycin. In our patient, the acute renal and hepatic toxicity was probable according to the Naranjo probability scale.
Although daptomycin is a well-tolerated antibacterial agent, clinicians should consider periodic monitoring of liver function and renal function tests to identify potential adverse effects.
Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) is involved in lymphatic metastatic spread. Metastatic site is a prognostic factor in melanoma. We assessed whether serum levels of VEGF-C are associated with metastatic sites or prognosis in patients treated for stage IV melanoma. The study included 64 patients, who received dacarbazine or four-drug chemotherapy (dacarbazine, vincristine, bleomycin and lomustine; BOLD) both combined with interferon-alfa. Serum samples for VEGF-C were analyzed by ELISA. The patients (n =22) with only skin and subcutaneous metastases had significantly lower mean VEGF-C levels (1 643 pg/ml) then the patients (n =42) with other distant metastases (2 584 pg/ml, Mann-Whitney, p =0.033). VEGF-C levels above the median (1 590 pg/ml) were significantly related to deep lymph node involvement (OR 3.763; 95% CI 1.038 - 13.646, p =0.034). There were no other significant associations between VEGF-C levels and tumour burden, nor were the levels significantly related to the response to therapy or survival. Those eight patients, who had received previous adjuvant IFN-alfa therapy had lower mean VEGF-C levels (1 738 pg/ml) as compared to those 56 patients without previous IFN-alfa therapy (2 335 pg/ml, ANOVA, p =0.026). This is the first study exploring serum VEGF-C in melanoma. VEGF-C might be involved in the deep lymphatic dissemination and progression of melanoma metastasis.
Ficolin-3, encoded by the FCN3 gene and expressed in the lung and liver, is a recognition molecule in the lectin pathway of the complement system. Heterozygosity for an FCN3 frameshift mutation (rs28357092), leading to a distortion of the C-terminal end of the molecule, occurs in people without disease (allele frequency among whites, 0.01). We describe a patient with recurrent infections who was homozygous for this mutation, who had undetectable serum levels of ficolin-3, and who had a deficiency in ficolin-3-dependent complement activation.
