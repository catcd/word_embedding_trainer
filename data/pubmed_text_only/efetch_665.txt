Neurologic manifestations, such as myoclonus, asterixis, seizures and altered level of consciousness, may be induced in patients with impaired renal function receiving β-lactam antibiotics, which stem in part from drug accumulation because of altered pharmacokinetics. Because of its long half-life and easy penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid, the third generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (CTRX), is often chosen to treat patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Here, the authors describe 4 patients with ESRD complicated with bacterial infection and choreoathetosis after the administration of CTRX. Choreoathetosis disappeared without leaving sequelae after CTRX therapy was withdrawn, although the severity and symptom duration varied. To our knowledge, there are few reports on choreoathetosis associated with β-lactam antibiotic administration in patients with kidney diseases. To prevent delayed diagnosis, one should bear in mind that choreoathetosis might occur in patients with ESRD treated with CTRX, when it is given in high or even regular doses.
Hepatic hypoperfusion is regarded as an important factor in the pathophysiology of perioperative liver injury. Although epidural anesthesia (EDA) is a widely used technique, no data are available about the effects on hepatic blood flow of thoracic EDA with blockade restricted to thoracic segments in humans.
In 20 patients under general anesthesia, we assessed hepatic blood flow index in the right and middle hepatic vein by use of multiplane transesophageal echocardiography before and after induction of EDA. The epidural catheter was inserted at TH7-9, and mepivacaine 1% with a median (range) dose of 10 (8-16) mL was injected. Norepinephrine (NE) was continuously administered to patients who demonstrated a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure below 60 mm Hg after induction of EDA (EDA-NE group). The other patients did not receive any catecholamine during the study period (EDA group). A further 10 patients without EDA served as controls (control group).
In five patients, administration of NE was necessary to avoid a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure below 60 mm Hg. Thus, the EDA-NE group consisted of five patients and the EDA group of 15. In the EDA group, EDA was associated with a median decrease in hepatic blood flow index of 24% in both hepatic veins (P < 0.01). In the EDA-NE group, all five patients showed a decrease in the blood flow index of the right (median decrease 39 [11-45] %) and middle hepatic vein (median decrease 32 [7-49] %). Patients in the control group showed a constant blood flow index in both hepatic veins. Reduction in blood flow index in the EDA group and the EDA-NE group was significant in comparison with the control group (P < 0.05). In contrast to hepatic blood flow, cardiac output was not affected by EDA.
We conclude that, in humans, thoracic EDA is associated with a decrease in hepatic blood flow. Thoracic EDA combined with continuous infusion of NE seems to result in a further decrease in hepatic blood flow.
This first clinical study of olanzapine in Japanese patients with schizophrenia was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine. Eighty-one patients were included in the analysis set. Mean modal dose for those patients were 9.4 +/- 3.6 mg/day. For the primary efficacy measure (Final Global Improvement Rating score), 14.8% of patients had remarkable improvement, 59.3% of patients had moderate improvement or better, and 86.4% of patients had slight improvement or better. Results from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale showed improvement from baseline in all clusters including positive psychotic symptoms (thought disturbance) but also against negative symptoms (anergia). The most commonly reported treatment-emergent signs and symptoms with > or =10% incidence, were insomnia, weight increase, excitement, sleepiness, and anxiety. There was a low incidence of extrapyramidal treatment-emergent signs and symptoms, and events reported were tremor (6.2%), muscle rigidity (3.7%), and akathisia (2.5%). The most commonly reported treatment-emergent laboratory changes, with > or = 20% of incidence, were prolactin elevations (24.3%) followed by increases in triglycerides (20.4%). However, mean prolactin values tended to be normalized during the study. This study result suggests that olanzapine is an "atypical" antipsychotic.
Here we examined the role of cellular vitamin C in genotoxicity of carcinogenic chromium(VI) that requires reduction to induce DNA damage. In the presence of ascorbate (Asc), low 0.2-2 microM doses of Cr(VI) caused 10-15 times more chromosomal breakage in primary human bronchial epithelial cells or lung fibroblasts. DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) were preferentially generated in G2 phase as detected by colocalization of H2AX and 53BP1 foci in cyclin B1-expressing cells. Asc dramatically increased the formation of centromere-negative micronuclei, demonstrating that induced DSB were inefficiently repaired. DSB in G2 cells were caused by aberrant mismatch repair of Cr damage in replicated DNA, as DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin and silencing of MSH2 or MLH1 by shRNA suppressed induction of H2AX and micronuclei. Cr(VI) was also up to 10 times more mutagenic in cells containing Asc. Increasing Asc concentrations generated progressively more mutations and DSB, revealing the genotoxic potential of otherwise nontoxic Cr(VI) doses. Asc amplified genotoxicity of Cr(VI) by altering the spectrum of DNA damage, as total Cr-DNA binding was unchanged and post-Cr loading of Asc exhibited no effects. Collectively, these studies demonstrated that Asc-dependent metabolism is the main source of genotoxic and mutagenic damage in Cr(VI)-exposed cells.
To report three new cases of the fluoxetine-induced syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
All three cases occurred in elderly psychiatric inpatients treated for depression with standard doses of fluoxetine within one month of starting the medication. All three patients were clinically symptomatic of SIADH.
In all three patients the medication was ceased and fluid restriction commenced. One patient required intravenous saline.
All three patients recovered fully within three weeks. None were rechallenged.
The symptoms of hyponatraemia due to fluoxetine-induced SIADH may be difficult to distinguish from the symptoms of depression, unless appropriate laboratory investigations are made.
We report on a rare case of a late-onset drug-induced lupus erythematosus. A 35 year old male patient complained about dyspnea, chest pain and reduced physical activity for three months. His medical history consisted of epilepsy treated with carbamazepine for 20 years. After diagnosis of a large pericardial effusion and percardiocentesis (1200 ml) the diagnosis of viral perimyocarditis was suspected. Under antiphlogistic treatment the symptoms vanished initially. Four weeks later the pericardial effusion recurred and a livedo reticularis became evident. A structural or infectious heart disease, in particular viral myocarditis, was ruled out invasively. Serologic testing revealed antinuclear antibodies and antibodies against histones without presence of antibody against ds-DNA, thereby confirming the diagnosis of carbamazepine-induced lupus erythematodes. After discontinuation of carbamazepine and immunosuppressive medication the patient recovered completely.
Guanfacine given intravenously causes a brief rise in blood pressure. This is followed by a sustained decrease of blood pressure, accompanied in one case by a marked orthostatic effect. In addition to its lowering effect on blood pressure, guanfacine also reduces heart rate. The duration of action for up to 72 h is due to the long half-life of the drug. The main side effects observed are fatigue and sedation.
Two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have described associations of variants in PNPLA3 with nonalcoholic fatty liver and plasma liver enzyme levels. We investigated the contributions of these variants to liver disease in Mestizo subjects with a history of alcohol dependence. We found that rs738409 in PNPLA3 is strongly associated with alcoholic liver disease and clinically evident alcoholic cirrhosis (unadjusted OR= 2.25, P=1.7 x 10(-10); ancestry-adjusted OR=1.79, P=1.9 x 10(-5)).
Mutation of the gene PARK2, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the most common cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease. In a search for multisite tumor suppressors, we identified PARK2 as a frequently targeted gene on chromosome 6q25.2-q27 in cancer. Here we describe inactivating somatic mutations and frequent intragenic deletions of PARK2 in human malignancies. The PARK2 mutations in cancer occur in the same domains, and sometimes at the same residues, as the germline mutations causing familial Parkinson's disease. Cancer-specific mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive effects of the PARK2 protein. PARK2 mutations in cancer decrease PARK2's E3 ligase activity, compromising its ability to ubiquitinate cyclin E and resulting in mitotic instability. These data strongly point to PARK2 as a tumor suppressor on 6q25.2-q27. Thus, PARK2, a gene that causes neuronal dysfunction when mutated in the germline, may instead contribute to oncogenesis when altered in non-neuronal somatic cells.
Multiple genetic variants have been associated with adult obesity and a few with severe obesity in childhood; however, less progress has been made in establishing genetic influences on common early-onset obesity. We performed a North American, Australian and European collaborative meta-analysis of 14 studies consisting of 5,530 cases (≥95th percentile of body mass index (BMI)) and 8,318 controls (<50th percentile of BMI) of European ancestry. Taking forward the eight newly discovered signals yielding association with P < 5 × 10(-6) in nine independent data sets (2,818 cases and 4,083 controls), we observed two loci that yielded genome-wide significant combined P values near OLFM4 at 13q14 (rs9568856; P = 1.82 × 10(-9); odds ratio (OR) = 1.22) and within HOXB5 at 17q21 (rs9299; P = 3.54 × 10(-9); OR = 1.14). Both loci continued to show association when two extreme childhood obesity cohorts were included (2,214 cases and 2,674 controls). These two loci also yielded directionally consistent associations in a previous meta-analysis of adult BMI(1).
Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a limiting side-effect of chemotherapy with ifosfamide (IFS). In the study presented here, we investigated the use of dexamethasone in combination with mesna for the prevention of IFS-induced HC.
Male Wistar rats (150-200 g; 6 rats per group) were treated with saline or mesna 5 min (i.p.) before and 2 and 6 h after (v.o.) administration of IFS. One, two or three doses of mesna were replaced with dexamethasone alone or with dexamethasone plus mesna. Cystitis was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis.
The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of mesna with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by IFS by 84.79% and 89.13%, respectively. In addition, it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by IFS. Moreover, the addition of dexamethasone to the last two doses of mesna was more efficient than three doses of mesna alone when evaluated microscopically.
Dexamethasone in combination with mesna was efficient in blocking IFS-induced HC. However, the replacement of last two doses of mesna with saline or all of the mesna doses with dexamethasone did not prevent HC.
The hemodynamic and respiratory effects of phentolamine i.v. (15-30 mg/h) on pulmonary hypertension following chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been studied in 13 patients under stable conditions. Phentolamine produced a significant reduction in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, right and left ventricular filling pressures and right ventricular stroke work index. Cardiac index and oxygen delivery increased significantly. Individual analysis showed that in 7 patients the driving pressure decreased across the pulmonary circulation with concomitant increase in cardiac output, suggesting a direct vasodilating effect of phentolamine on the pulmonary circulation. Pulmonary gas exchange did not change significantly. In conclusion, in patients with pulmonary hypertension following COPD phentolamine given i.v. may have beneficial effects on right ventricular function and peripheral oxygen delivery without detrimental effect on gas exchange.
Hyperlipidemia, particularly hypercholesterolemia, occurs in cardiac transplant recipients both as a preexisting condition and as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy. Lovastatin (Mevacor) has emerged as an agent that may effectively manage this condition. Few serious side effects of this drug have been observed. We describe two cardiac transplant recipients treated with lovastatin in conjunction with their other medications, including cyclosporine, who developed acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis. Resolution of muscle damage followed discontinuation of cyclosporine and lovastatin therapy. We postulate that hepatic dysfunction secondary to cyclosporine predisposed these patients to lovastatin-induced muscle damage. Use of this drug in cardiac and other organ transplant recipients should be accompanied by close surveillance of creatine kinase, hepatic transaminases, and cyclosporine levels.
The drug treatment of Parkinson's disease should be tailored to the age of the patient, coexistence of dementia or postural hypotension, duration of the disease process and the emergence of side effects. In the early stages of the disease when disability is minimal, amantadine or anti-cholinergic drugs may suffice. As the patient's lifestyle becomes hampered, levodopa in combination with carbidopa or benserazide is introduced. Mild dopa induced dyskinesia can be ignored but when it is troublesome the dose of levodopa should be reduced. Fluctuations are minimised by giving small doses of levodopa frequently throughout the day or by adding bromocriptine to the drug regimen. Postural symptoms often respond to fludrocortisone and elevation of the head of the bed. In elderly or demented patients anticholinergic drugs and amantadine should be avoided. In these patients small doses of levodopa alone may be preferable to the combined preparations. More effective drugs with fewer side effects are likely to emerge with future successful research into the different types of dopamine receptors and other possible transmitters.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most powerful and widely prescribed chemotherapeutic agents to treat divergent human cancers. However, the clinical use of DOX is restricted due to its severe cardiotoxic side-effects. There has been ongoing search for cardioprotectants against DOX toxicity. Inorganic nitrate has emerged as a bioactive compound that can be reduced into nitrite and nitric oxide in vivo and in turn plays a therapeutic role in diseases associated with nitric oxide insufficiency or dysregulation. In this review, we describe a novel concept of using dietary supplementation of inorganic nitrate to reduce DOX-induced cardiac cellular damage and dysfunction, based on our recent promising studies in a mouse model of DOX cardiotoxicity. Our data show that chronic oral ingestion of sodium nitrate, at a dose equivalent to ~400% of the Acceptable Daily Intake of the World Health Organization, alleviated DOX-induced left ventricular dysfunction and mitochondrial respiratory chain damage. Such cardioprotective effects were associated with reduction of cardiomyocyte necrosis/apoptosis, tissue lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial H(2)O(2) generation following DOX treatment. Furthermore, proteomic studies revealed enhanced cardiac expression of mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme - peroxiredoxin 5 in the nitrate-treated animals. These studies suggest that inorganic nitrate could be an inexpensive therapeutic agent for long-term oral administration in preventing DOX-induced cardiac toxicity and myopathy during the prolonged pathological process. Future clinical trials in the cancer patients undergoing DOX chemotherapy are warranted to translate these experimental findings into an effective new therapy in preventing the DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.
Gastric cancer is a major cause of global cancer mortality. We surveyed the spectrum of somatic alterations in gastric cancer by sequencing the exomes of 15 gastric adenocarcinomas and their matched normal DNAs. Frequently mutated genes in the adenocarcinomas included TP53 (11/15 tumors), PIK3CA (3/15) and ARID1A (3/15). Cell adhesion was the most enriched biological pathway among the frequently mutated genes. A prevalence screening confirmed mutations in FAT4, a cadherin family gene, in 5% of gastric cancers (6/110) and FAT4 genomic deletions in 4% (3/83) of gastric tumors. Frequent mutations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A, MLL3 and MLL) also occurred in 47% of the gastric cancers. We detected ARID1A mutations in 8% of tumors (9/110), which were associated with concurrent PIK3CA mutations and microsatellite instability. In functional assays, we observed both FAT4 and ARID1A to exert tumor-suppressor activity. Somatic inactivation of FAT4 and ARID1A may thus be key tumorigenic events in a subset of gastric cancers.
Modulation of the DNA repair pathway is an emerging target for the development of anticancer drugs. DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs), one of the most severe forms of DNA damage caused by anticancer drugs such as cisplatin and mitomycin C (MMC), activates the Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Inhibition of the FA/BRCA pathway can enhance the cytotoxic effects of ICL-inducing anticancer drugs and can reduce anticancer drug resistance. To find FA/BRCA pathway inhibitory small molecules, we established a cell-based high-content screening method for quantitating the activation of the FA/BRCA pathway by measuring FANCD2 foci on DNA lesions and then applied our method to chemical screening. Using commercial LOPAC1280 chemical library screening, ouabain was identified as a competent FA/BRCA pathway inhibitory compound. Ouabain, a member of the cardiac glycoside family, binds to and inhibits Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and has been used to treat heart disease for many years. We observed that ouabain, as well as other cardiac glycoside family members--digitoxin and digoxin--down-regulated FANCD2 and FANCI mRNA levels, reduced monoubiquitination of FANCD2, inhibited FANCD2 foci formation on DNA lesions, and abrogated cell cycle arrest induced by MMC treatment. These inhibitory activities of ouabain required p38 MAPK and were independent of cellular Ca(2+) ion increase or the drug uptake-inhibition effect of ouabain. Furthermore, we found that ouabain potentiated the cytotoxic effects of MMC in tumor cells. Taken together, we identified an additional effect of ouabain as a FA/BRCA pathway-inhibiting chemosensitization compound. The results of this study suggest that ouabain may serve as a chemosensitizer to ICL-inducing anticancer drugs.
Levosimendan is the first available drug of a new class of agents called calcium sensitizers. It increases cardiac contractility without increasing myocardial oxygen consumption. This new molecule has no proarrhythmic effects and has anti-ischemic properties. Levosimendan is infused over a 24-hour period and its hemodynamic effects, similar or superior to those of catecholamines, persist during one week. In a selected group of advanced heart failure patients levosimendan was associated with a mortality reduction at 14 days and at 6 months in comparison with dobutamine. In spite of its cost, this new inotropic agent appears very promising and it is expected that it will be widely used.
We report the case of a 45 year old woman who developed photophobia after 6 months on lithium at non-toxic levels.
Lithium was reintroduced twice and on both occasions this side-effect reoccurred within days.
Photophobia has only been described previously as a symptom of lithium intoxication.
Traditionally, the mineralocorticoid receptor was thought to be activated by the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone, and to exhibit its main action on epithelia by promoting renal sodium retention, potassium excretion and inducing hypertension upon excessive activation. Recently, evidence appeared that mineralocorticoid receptors are expressed in nonepithelial cells and activated by endogenous glucocorticoids including cortisol. Therefore, the prereceptor regulation of cortisol access to the mineralocorticoid receptors by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes (11beta-HSDs), a mechanism absent in most nonepithelial cells, appears to be relevant for disease states with cortisol-induced mineralocorticoid action. The present review focuses on direct and indirect effects attributable to mineralocorticoid receptor activation by glucocorticoids.
The determination of the intracellular topology of 11beta-HSD1, facing the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and 11beta-HSD2, facing the cytoplasm, suggests that 11beta-HSD1 acts as a prereceptor mechanism in the local activation of glucocorticoid receptors, whereas 11beta-HSD2 controls mineralocorticoid receptors by interacting with the receptor in the absence of aldosterone. Downregulation of 11beta-HSD2 was observed with various stimuli including hypoxia, shear stress, angiotensin II and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The corresponding signal transcription pathways and some relevant transcription factors have been identified. Renal sodium retention in liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome and hypoxia have been linked to 11beta-HSD2 reduced activity. Overexpression of 11beta-HSD1 specifically in adipose tissue in mice caused central obesity, a metabolic syndrome and hypertension due to increased intracellular cortisol concentrations. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists reduce 11beta-HSD1 activity and diminish the intracellular availability of cortisol, an effect accompanied by a decline in blood pressure. Three individuals with loss-of-function mutations of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma developed early hypertension. A potential mechanism might be glucocorticoid dependent mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.
Recently, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have been used in the randomized aldactone evaluation study (RALES) with spironolactone, the eplerenone post-AMI heart failure efficacy and survival study (EPHESUS), and in severe and postmyocardial infarct heart failure, respectively. These investigations cannot be understood on the basis of the present physiological knowledge and underscore the relevance of focusing on mineralocorticoid receptor activation by ligands other than aldosterone.
A 35-year-old postpartum woman who was receiving bromocriptine (Parlodel) for only several days to suppress lactation experienced an episode of a seizure, complained of chest pains, and died in the emergency department. At autopsy, acute coronary thrombosis of the left main, left anterior descending, and circumflex arteries was found. Cases of reported cardiac-related complications associated with bromocriptine use in the puerperium are extremely rare. The mechanism of bromocriptine-related acute coronary thrombosis is poorly understood and warrants further scrutiny, because the synthetic brominated ergopeptide is generally regarded as safe. The updated review of reports available in literature mandates the acknowledgment of possible serious and even lethal cardiac events as a result of untoward effects of bromocriptine.
This study was designed to investigate the potential use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a naturally occurring vasodilator, for producing profound intraoperative hypotension. Six mongrel dogs were anesthetized with morphine, nitrous oxide, and oxygen, paralyzed with pancuronium, and ventilated to a PaCO2 of 40. The mean arterial pressure was lowered to 40 mm Hg with an intravenous infusion of ATP (10.6 +/- 3.5 (SE) mg/kg/minute). Blood flow was determined using the radioactive microsphere technique. Measurements were made before and 20, 40, and 60 minutes after the induction of hypotension and after a 40-minute recovery. Infusion of ATP to lower the mean arterial pressure to 40 mm Hg resulted in a reduction of mean arterial pressure of 64% and an increase in heart rate of 11% accompanied by frequent cardiac arrhythmias. However, cardiac output decreased only 8%. Myocardial flow increased 137%, kidney flow decreased 71%, and masseter muscle flow increased 333%. A severe metabolic acidosis developed with a reduction in pH from control values of 7.39 +/- 0.03 to 7.16 +/- 0.03 after 60 minutes of hypotension. The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, determined using the oxygen content of the sagittal sinus, was not affected. Cerebral hemisphere blood flow decreased 21%, caudate nucleus flow decreased 31%, and corpus callosum flow decreased 43%. Blood flow to the brain stem and cerebellum was unchanged. Hypotension was readily induced, maintained, and reversed using ATP, without apparent tachyphylaxis. However, the profound metabolic acidosis and cardiac arrhythmias that occurred may be serious contraindications to the use of this agent clinically.
To report three cases of infantile spasms (IS) with an abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signal in the basal ganglia (Leigh-like syndrome), due to T8993G mt DNA mutation.
The first sign was, at the end of the first year of life, IS in one case and the combination of IS with behavior changes in the two other cases. Video EEG polygraphy demonstrated both spasms and hypsarrhythmia, but no other kind of seizures. Vigabatrin or steroids controlled the spasms with a follow-up of several years. All 3 patients had hyperlactatorrhachia (3.47 to 7 mmol/l). Axial hypotonia and dystonia appeared by the end of the first year of life. As in cases with the NARP mutation and onset later in life, neuropathy and retinopathy could also be demonstrated.
Although it is well established that symptomatic IS with hypsarrhythmia mainly result from cortical lesions, this epileptic encephalopathy may also be generated by lesions in the basal ganglia without evidence of cortical damage. This finding suggests that West syndrome is likely to be caused by age-related dysfunction at any level of a cortico-putaminal loop of hyperexcitability.
Amiodarone, a drug used to treat refractory cardiac arrhythmias, produced a peripheral neuropathy in 5 of 50 cases (10%). Although the neuropathy may be severe, it tends to improve with lowering of the dosage or discontinuation of the medication.
A 57-year-old man developed spontaneous skin bruising and haematuria during combined therapy with warfarin and indomethacin. Due to the potential effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the anticoagulant action of warfarin and platelet function, patients receiving both warfarin and NSAIDs should have their prothrombin time monitored very closely. Also, the risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage with any NSAIDs must always be remembered.
We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography.
We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company, which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera.
Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3,774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2,820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992. Before angiography, intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions. For three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing. The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution. There were 13 cases of adverse reactions (0.34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea, exanthema, urtication, itchiness, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment. Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein, which required treatment, and two cases of hypotension. The two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock.
A comparison of frequency of adverse reactions to indocyanine green with the previously reported frequency of such reactions to fluorescein sodium indicated that indocyanine green is a safe as fluorescein for use in angiography.
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) remains an incurable disease that requires innovative new approaches to improve therapeutic outcome. Honokiol is a natural product known to possess potent antineoplastic and antiangiogenic properties. We examined whether honokiol can overcome apoptotic resistance in primary tumor cells derived from B-CLL patients. Honokiol induced caspase-dependent cell death in all of the B-CLL cells examined and was more toxic toward B-CLL cells than to normal mononuclear cells, suggesting greater susceptibility of the malignant cells. Honokiol-induced apoptosis was characterized by the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 and cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Exposure of B-CLL cells to honokiol resulted in up-regulation of Bcl2-associated protein (Bax) and down-regulation of the expression of the key survival protein myeloid-cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), which is associated with response to treatment in B-CLL patients. In addition, B-CLL cells pretreated with interleukin-4 (IL-4), a cytokine known to support B-CLL survival, underwent apoptosis when subsequently incubated with honokiol, indicating that honokiol could also overcome the prosurvival effects of IL-4. Furthermore, honokiol enhanced cytotoxicity induced by fludarabine, cladribine, or chlorambucil. These data indicate that honokiol is a potent inducer of apoptosis in B-CLL cells and should be examined for further clinical application either as a single agent or in combination with other anticancer agents.
Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) assesses cerebral oxygen saturation (Sco2) as a balance between cerebral oxygen delivery and consumption. In 71 patients, we evaluated whether marked reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) during propofol-fentanyl anesthesia induction affects frontal lobe Sco2. The NIRS-determined arm muscle oxygenation (Smo2), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (CO) were monitored, endtidal carbon dioxide tension was controlled at 3.5 to 4.5 kPa, and central blood volume was maintained. Before anesthesia, the median (range) MAP, HR, and CO were 93 mm Hg (61-126 mm Hg), 76 beats/min (50-96 beats/min), and 5.3 L/min (2.4-9.0 L/min), respectively, but immediately following intravenous administration of fentanyl and propofol, MAP decreased to 63 mm Hg (37-109 mm Hg), HR to 63 beats/min (40-103 beats/min), and CO to 4.1 L/min (7.9-70 L/min) (P < .05). When blood pressure decreased, the median (range) NIRS-determined Smo2 also decreased (73% [54%-94%] to 71% [52%-87%]), whereas Sco2 increased from 67% (46%-93%) to 74% (48%-95%) (P < .05), independent of age and gender. After anesthesia induction, variables recovered and remained at preanesthetic levels during surgery. The findings implicate that even an approximately 30% drop in MAP at the induction of anesthesia does not typically affect cerebral oxygenation.
This study aimed to determine the mechanism of hypertension associated with nitric oxide synthase inhibition. Intravenous injections of NG-nitro-L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, produced a sustained increase in systemic blood pressure and a decrease in heart rate in anesthetized dogs, whereas NG-nitro-D-arginine had no effect. L-Arginine reversed the pressor response. NG-Nitro-L-arginine-induced hypertension was markedly attenuated or abolished by treatment with hexamethonium; this inhibition was still observed when the blood pressure fall caused by the ganglionic blocking agent was compensated by continuous infusion of angiotensin II. In dogs treated with phentolamine in a dose sufficient to lower blood pressure to the level similar to that elicited by hexamethonium and to suppress the pressor response to norepinephrine, the hypertensive effect of NG-nitro-L-arginine was not attenuated. We conclude that hypertension caused by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor is associated with an elimination of nitroxidergic neural function rather than an impairment of the basal release of nitric oxide from the endothelium.
