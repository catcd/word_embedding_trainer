Feitai, a Chinese medicine formulation, has been shown to protect against lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin (BLM). In the present study, we investigated the effect of Feitai on transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which play important roles in the pathogenesis of BLM-induced lung fibrosis. The results demonstrated that Feitai could significantly attenuate BLM-induced acute lung inflammation and subsequent lung fibrosis. Meanwhile, the expression of MCP-1 and TGF-beta1 mRNA in the lungs increased in the BLM-treated group compared with the saline-instilled control group and Feitai treatment significantly decreased cytokine expression in BLM-treated mice. In addition, Feitai diminished the accumulation of MCP-1- and TGF-beta1-positive cells in lung tissues at the time of peak mRNA levels. In summary, the results of the present study indicate that treatment with Feitai ameliorates BLM-induced lung fibrosis, at least in part via the inhibition of MCP-1 and TGF-beta1 expression.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most frequent, chronic, progressive degenerative disorders of the CNS, characterised by altered neurotransmission of dopamine in the basal ganglia. This may result in disturbances of movement, mobility and posture symptoms, all of which cause severe disability in PD patients. There is no cure for PD. Current treatment approaches aim at symptomatic improvement with a balance of the altered neurotransmission, particularly in striatal dopaminergic neurons. Levodopa, the metabolic precursor of active dopamine, is the most effective compound in the drug treatment of PD. However, chronic exposure to levodopa and related dopaminergic agents supports an onset of movement behaviour fluctuations and dyskinesia in the long term. Dyskinesia is unwanted, sometimes excessive and causes abnormal facial, body and limb movements that appear in many PD patients who are often dependent on the overall dosage of dopaminergic substitution. This complication of anti-Parkinsonian drug therapy supports disability and reduces quality of life in PD patients and their caregivers. This review focuses on the major clinical features and knowledge on the aetiology of these treatment-associated, long-term side effects of dopaminergic drug treatment in PD. It also gives an overview of existing and potential future treatment-strategies for the management of these troublesome treatment complications that affect motor behaviour in PD patients.
The relationship between CYP2A6 genotype and smoking status remains unclear although several studies have been reported. In this study, we have investigated the significance of CYP2A6 genotype on smoking habit and treatment of nicotine patch. Sixty-one smokers (1.7%) working in a Japanese company (n = 3585) participated in this smoking cessation program. Forty-four of 61 (72.1%) smokers were treated by nicotine patch. A genotyping analysis was carried out for 41 (40 men and 1 women) of 61 participants (67.2%). The smoking cessation rate at 90 days was 54.1% (33/61). Age and smoking years in re-smoking group are significantly lower than those in smoking cessation group. The smoking cessation rate of participants treated with nicotine patch (63.6%; 28/44) was significantly higher than that of the group non-treated with nicotine patch (29.4%; 5/17) at 90 days (p < 0.05). The incidence of homozygotes of CYP2A6 gene deletion (CYP2A619934/19934) in 41 cases (9.8%; 4/41) could be higher than that in 894 healthy controls (3.7%; 33/894) (p = 0.12), while no other variant alleles (CYP2A619932, CYP2A619933 and CYP2A619936) were found. Age and smoking years of participants with CYP2A619934/19934 are significantly higher than those with CYP2A619931 positive. The scores of Fagerstrom test, an analysis for nicotine-dependence, were slightly different between participants with CYP2A619934/19934 and CYP2A619931 positive. Although treatment of nicotine patch is efficacious to smoking cessation, cases with CYP2A619934/19934 might be more sensitive to nicotine adverse effects and more difficult to quit smoking once they have smoking habit.
Sulphasalazine was first introduced for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 1942. Following initial enthusiasm, interest waned until 1978 when a large open study suggested that it might have a 'second-line effect'. Since then further studies have confirmed this effect and once again rheumatologists are starting to use sulphasalazine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In this review we examine the pharmacology of sulphasalazine and its metabolites, comment upon the possible modes of action and review the recent literature pertaining to its use in rheumatoid arthritis.
summary. Antiviral treatment of patients with active chronic hepatitis B may lead to significant reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, after stopping nucleoside therapy, relapse rates are high in those without acquired specific immunity. We have treated two chronic hepatitis B patients with in vivo immunization. In vivo immunization aims to optimize conditions for an effective immune response: following rapid and profound virus suppression by interferon-lamivudine combination therapy, lamivudine is withdrawn intermittently for 4 weeks during continued interferon therapy. In both patients with profound virus suppression a rapid rebound in viral replication was observed after lamivudine withdrawal; despite continued interferon. These periods of renewed viral replication were followed by rises in hepatitis activity. After re-introduction of lamivudine HBV DNA became undetectable by PCR followed by normalization of serum ALT. These observations are a stimulus to further explore the concept of in vivo immunization as a novel therapeutic approach for chronic hepatitis B.
Cannabis dependence is a growing problem among individuals who use marijuana frequently, and genetic differences make some users more liable to progress to dependence. The identification of intermediate phenotypes of cannabis dependence may aid candidate genetic analysis. Promising intermediate phenotypes include craving for marijuana, withdrawal symptoms after abstinence, and sensitivity to its acute effects. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding for fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) has demonstrated association with substance use disorder diagnoses, but has not been studied with respect to these narrower phenotypes. FAAH is an enzyme that inactivates anandamide, an endogenous agonist for CB(1) receptors (to which Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol binds). CB(1) binding modulates mesocorticolimbic dopamine release, which underlies many facets of addiction.
The SNP, FAAH C385A (rs324420), was examined to determine whether its variance was associated with changes in craving and withdrawal after marijuana abstinence, craving after cue exposure, or sensitivity to the acute effects of marijuana.
Forty daily marijuana users abstained for 24 h, were presented with a cue-elicited craving paradigm and smoked a marijuana cigarette in the laboratory.
C385A variance was significantly associated with changes in withdrawal after abstinence, and happiness after smoking marijuana in the predicted directions, was associated with changes in heart rate after smoking in the opposite of the predicted direction, and was not associated with changes in craving or other acute effects.
These data lend support to some previous association studies of C385A, but suggest that further refinement of these intermediate phenotypes is necessary.
Osteocalcin (OC), a noncollagenous bone matrix protein, is specifically produced by osteoblasts. Previously, we demonstrated that OC immunohistochemical staining was found in primary prostate cancer (PC) and PC metastasis to lymph node and bone. Advanced and metastatic PC is commonly treated by hormonal therapy (H/T). Inevitably, these patients will relapse and develop hormone-refractory (HR) PC. The aim of this study was to realize the OC expression in PC before H/T and after H/T when HRPC developed.
Twenty patients with PC received H/T and later developed HRPC. The interval of androgen-response was classified by good response (Group A, > or = 30 months) and poor response (Group B, < 30 months). The mean interval of androgen-response was 48.8 months in Group A (10 patients) and 17.5 months in Group B (10 patients). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PC before H/T and HRPC for each patient were stained for osteocalcin.
Osteocalcin immunohistochemical stain was detected in 18 of 20 PC before H/T and 19 of 20 of HRPC. Compared to PC before H/T, the expression of OC in HRPC increased in 5 cases (4 of Group A, 1 of Group B), did not change in 3 (2 of Group A, 1 of Group B) and decreased in 12 (4 of Group A, 8 of Group B).
Our data suggest the expression of OC in PC is not correlated to the response of H/T. OC expression was still noted in 95% of HRPC. OC may be a target for treatment of HRPC.
We have used cocaine-conditioned locomotion in rats as an animal model for cocaine-conditioned responses that contribute to drug craving and relapse in human addicts. The purpose of the present study was to examine the ability of the GABA(B) agonist, baclofen, to attenuate such associative responses. First, experiments were conducted to identify a dose range of baclofen that did not impede exploratory or spontaneous behavior. This dose range was used during testing for conditioned locomotion specific to a flashing light and metronome, which were previously associated with administration of cocaine (PAIRED group) or saline (UNPAIRED group). At 2.0 mg/kg, baclofen attenuated conditioned locomotion in PAIRED subjects to the level of UNPAIRED subjects receiving saline or 2.0 mg/kg baclofen. Considering the importance of glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) during associative responses to reward-related stimuli, the effect of baclofen on extracellular levels of glutamate in the NAc was tested with microdialysis. Baclofen (2.0 mg/kg) did not alter basal glutamate levels. However, baclofen pretreatment prevented the predatory odor, 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, from increasing glutamate levels. This is the first report of baclofen modulating extracellular levels of glutamate in the NAc. Baclofen may prove to have general utility for suppressing stimulus-evoked increases in NAc glutamate levels. This could explain its ability to prevent cocaine-conditioned responses. In summary, our results suggest that enhancing GABA(B) transmission inhibits cocaine-conditioned responses, possibly by suppressing glutamate transmission in the NAc. A better understanding of interactions between GABA and glutamate transmission in the NAc may lead to the development of pharmacotherapies for cocaine craving.
Rat recipients of renal allografts and unilaterally nephrectomized control rats were studied to evaluate the response in blood pressure to prednisolone in diverse doses, and to determine the dosage required to achieve adequate immunosuppression without undue complication of hypertension. While a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg/day or more of prednisolone proved effective in prolonging allograft survival time, this dosage increased the blood pressure of recipients as well as unilaterally nephrectomized control rats. In contrast to control rats, the recipients remained hypertensive after the cessation of prednisolone administration. This suggests that the high blood pressure observed during prednisolone administration was due to its hypertensive action. On the other hand, the high blood pressure remaining after cessation of the prednisolone administration is likely to be caused by an incomplete prevention of rejection. If recipients had received a transfusion of donor-strain blood prior to transplantation in combination with the infusion of 2 mg/kg/day or more of prednisolone, they became normotensive when the prednisolone infusion was ceased. By reducing the prednisolone dosage to 1 mg/kg/day in combination with donor-strain blood pretreatment, hypertension could also be eliminated during the first two weeks. In conclusion, effective immuno suppression can be achieved with prednisolone in rats, without inducing hypertension, provided prednisolone is administered at a low dosage in combination with adjuvant immunosuppression--i.e., donor-strain blood pretreatment.
The long-term efficacy of a childhood hepatitis B vaccination programme was evaluated. A total of 112 newborn babies of hepatitis B carrier mothers were given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and a 10-microg three-dose regimen of plasma-derived vaccine administered at a conventional (0, 1, 6 months), delayed (2, 3, 8 months) or accelerated (0, 1, 2 months) schedule. The vaccinees were followed up to determine their anti-HBs status over a 16-year period. Upon completion of the vaccination schedules, 92.6% developed antibody against surface antigen (anti-HBs) seroconverion, the rate of which fell to 33.3% at year 16. The three schedules were equally effective in preventing chronic infection, with a protective efficacy of 88.9% from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriage, compared with historical control. Vaccinees on the delayed schedule had a slightly higher seroconversion rate over years, and were better able to maintain an anti-HBs level of > or = 100 iu/L. Overall, a quarter demonstrated evidence of exposure to the virus, being positive for antibody against core antigen or HBsAg, or mounting a rise in anti-HBs during the follow-up period. We conclude that a three-dose hepatitis B vaccination regimen is generally effective in protecting newborns of hepatitis B carrier mothers from infection and chronic carriage. Booster is not needed even after 16 years of monitoring.
Oral valacyclovir's efficacy and tolerability as suppressive therapy versus episodic therapy were compared for recurrent herpes labialis (RHL). Subjects with a history of at least 3 RHL episodes in the past year were randomized to receive 6 months of oral valacyclovir episodic therapy at the first sign of prodrome (two 2-g doses separated by 12 hours) and 6 months of oral valacyclovir suppressive therapy (1 g once daily) for 6 months in open-label, crossover fashion. The mean +/- SE number of recurrences per 120 days of follow-up (primary endpoint) was lower with suppressive therapy (0.30 +/- 0.41) than episodic therapy (0.71 +/- 0.79) (P < .005). The probability of remaining recurrence free over 6 months was significantly higher with suppressive therapy than episodic therapy. The median time to first recurrence was 81 days with episodic therapy and was not calculable (> 180 days) for suppressive therapy (P = 0.021). Data for secondary efficacy endpoints (pain severity score, mean duration of recurrences, maximal total lesion area) showed approximately a 30% to 50% reduction in mean values with suppressive therapy compared with episodic therapy, but results were statistically significantly different between the regimens for pain severity only. The percentage of subjects with at least one adverse event over 6 months of treatment that was considered to be drug related was 3% with suppressive therapy and 6% with episodic therapy. Suppressive therapy with oral valacyclovir was more effective than episodic therapy with oral valacyclovir in reducing the frequency of recurrences of herpes labialis and prolonging the time to first recurrence and was also similarly well-tolerated.
To explore the relation between genetic polymorphisms in XRCC1 and risks of chronic benzene poisoning (BP).
A case-control study was conducted. 152 BP patients and 152 workers occupationally exposed to benzene without poisoning manifestations were investigated. PCR-RFLP was applied to detect the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on c.194, c.280 and c.399 of XRCC1 gene.
The proportion of XRCC1 c.194Arg/Trp + Trp/Trp genotypes in the case group was lower than that of the control group, while there was a higher proportion for XRCC1 C.280Arg/His + His/His in the case group. There was a 1.67-fold decreased risk of BP for individuals carrying XRCC1 C.194Arg/Trp + Trp/Trp genotypes (OR adj = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.37-0.97, P = 0.039) compared with subjects carrying Arg/Arg allele, and individuals carrying genotypes of XRCC1 C.280Arg/His + His/His had a 1.91-fold increased risk of BP compared with these carrying the wild allele (OR adj = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.17-3.10, P = 0.009).
The risk of BP for subjects carrying XRCC1 c.194Arg/Trp + Trp/Trp genotypes may decrease while for individuals carrying XRCC1 c.280Arg/His + His/His genotypes may increase.
Seizures is a major toxicity of theophylline. The mechanism of theophylline-induced seizures is not known, but antagonism at adenosine receptors may be a possibility. The effect of pretreatment with different doses of adenosine (100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.), and the adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p., was studied against seizures induced by theophylline in rats. Both these drugs, at all dose levels tested, failed to protect theophylline seizures. Thus adenosinergic system is unlikely to be involved in mediating the convulsant action of theophylline. On the other hand, the conventional antiepileptic drugs, i.e. diazepam (4 mg/kg), sodium valproate (300 mg/kg) and phenobarbitone (50 mg/kg), but not carbamazepine, afforded some protection. The modification of course of seizures, by the antiepileptic drugs suggests the involvement of some other alternate mechanism in theophylline-induced seizures.
The chemical weapon nerve agent known as Russian VX (VR) is a potent organophosphorus (OP) compound that is much less studied than its VX analogue with respect to toxicity, as well as to the effectiveness of several known countermeasures against it. An anaesthetized domestic swine model was utilized to assess several approaches in mitigating its toxicity, including the utility of cooling VR treated skin to increase the therapeutic window for treatment. The 6h LD₅₀ for VR topically applied on the ear was 100 μg/kg. Treatment of VR exposed animals (5 × LD₅₀) with pralidoxime (2PAM) very poorly regenerated inhibited blood cholinesterase activity, but was partially effective in preventing signs of OP poisoning and increasing survival. In contrast, treatment with the Hagedorn oxime HI-6 reactivated cholinesterase, eliminated all signs of poisoning and prevented death. Decontamination with the Reactive Skin Decontaminant Lotion (RSDL) 15 min after VR exposure was completely effective in preventing death. Cooling of the VR exposure sites for 2 or 6h prevented signs of OP poisoning and death during the cooling period. However, these animals died very quickly after the cessation of cooling, unless they were treated with oxime or decontaminated with RSDL. Blood analyses showed that cooling of agent exposure sites delayed the entry of VR into the bloodstream. Medical treatment with HI-6 and to a lesser extent 2PAM, or decontamination with RSDL are effective in protecting against the toxic effects of cutaneous exposure to VR. Immobilizing this agent (and related compounds) within the dermal reservoir by cooling the exposure sites, dramatically increases the therapeutic window in which these medical countermeasures are effective.
We report a case of 1:1 flutter in a patient taking flecaïnide for atrial fibrillation. We discuss the mechanism of the arrhythmia, its treatment and the preventive attitude to be adopted.
High doses (>or=500 mg/m) of cyclophosphamide are known to cause venoocclusive disease (VOD). The authors recently observed a patient treated with immunosuppressive cyclophosphamide doses (100 mg/day) and roxithromycin who developed VOD. Because roxithromycin inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein, the patient may have been exposed to higher cyclophosphamide and/or cyclophosphamide metabolite concentrations.
The effect of roxithromycin on the metabolism and toxicity of cyclophosphamide was studied using human hepatic microsomes and a human endothelial cell line.
Cyclophosphamide or roxithromycin at concentrations from 0.05 to 500 micromol/L were not toxic to endothelial cells as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage assay. However, the combination of roxithromycin (500 micromol/L) and cyclophosphamide was toxic for all the tested cyclophosphamide concentrations (0.05 to 500 micromol/L) without clear concentration dependence (LDH ratio 38.3 +/- 11.0 [mean +/- SEM] for the combination with cyclophosphamide 0.05 micromol/L and 50.2 +/- 10.2 for the combination with cyclophosphamide 500 micromol/L; P <or= 0.005 for all tested combinations vs. control). Although roxithromycin did not favor the generation of toxic metabolites from cyclophosphamide, it led to cyclophosphamide accumulation due to inhibition of both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Although roxithromycin inhibited P-glycoprotein, this was not the mechanism by which cyclophosphamide toxicity was increased because cyclophosphamide in combination with other P-glycoprotein inhibitors was not toxic to endothelial cells. In the presence of roxithromycin (500 micromol/L), cyclophosphamide (500 micromol/L) induced apoptosis in endothelial cells (34.3 +/- 10.4% apoptotic cells [in % of total cells] for the combination of cyclophosphamide and roxithromycin, 0.7 +/- 0.25% for cyclophosphamide alone, 0% for roxithromycin alone; P < 0.0001) most probably by mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and release of cytochrome c.
The combination cyclophosphamide and roxithromycin, but not the individual compounds, is toxic to endothelial cells by inducing apoptosis. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein and formation of toxic metabolites are unlikely causes.
Valproate-induced encephalopathy is a rare syndrome that may manifest in otherwise normal epileptic individuals. It may even present in patients who have tolerated this medicine well in the past. It is usually but not necessarily associated with hyperammonemia. The EEG shows characteristic triphasic waves in most patients with this complication. A case of valproate-induced encephalopathy is presented. The problems in diagnosing this condition are subsequently discussed.
Two cases of haemorrhagic cystitis following treatment with methicillin and penicillin G are presented. Two males, aged 24 and 45 years, presented identical symptoms including haematuria, dysuria and pollakisuria. The condition has in rare instances been described as caused by antibiotic treatment; in all cases a penicillin was involved. All symptoms promptly vanished when the antibiotic treatment was stopped, and the reactions were possibly allergic since cross-reactions between different penicillins have been described in earlier cases.
The effects of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and losartan, an angiotensin II receptor type I antagonist, were investigated on alterations in myofibrillar ATPase activity as well as myosin heavy chain (MHC) content and gene expression in failing hearts following myocardial infarction (MI). Three weeks after ligation of the left coronary artery, rats were treated with or without enalapril (10 mg/kg/day), and/or losartan (20 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks. The infarcted animals exhibited an increase in left ventricle (LV) end diastolic pressure and depressed rates of LV pressure development as well as pressure decay. LV myofibrillar Ca2+ -stimulated ATPase activity was decreased in the infarcted hearts compared with controls, MHC alpha-isoform content was significantly decreased whereas that of MHC beta-isoform was markedly increased. The level of MHC alpha-isoform mRNA was decreased whereas that of MHC beta-isoform was increased in the viable infarcted LV. Treatment of animal with enalapril, losartan, or combination of enalapril and losartan partially prevented the MI induced changes in LV function, myofibrillar Ca2+ -stimulated ATPase activity, MHC protein expression and MHC gene expression. The results suggest that the beneficial effects of the renin-angiotensin system blockade in heart failure are associated with partial prevention of myofibrillar remodeling.
Epidemiological studies show that a positive correlation exists between the consumption of strongly heated meat and fish and the development of colorectal tumours. In this context, it has been postulated that the uptake of toxic substances formed during meat and fish processing such as heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAs) may be causally related to colon carcinogenesis. In a previous study, we have shown that 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), the most abundantly formed HCA in the above-mentioned food items, is mainly absorbed in the small intestine (i.e. proximal jejunum) of the rat. In the present study, we analysed whether PhIP can actively be secreted by enterocytes in the rat proximal jejunum and distal colon. Unidirectional PhIP flux rates from the mucosal-to-the serosal compartment (J ms ) and in the opposite direction (J sm ) were examined in Ussing chambers with (14)C-PhIP as radiotracer and in the absence of electrochemical gradients. Under these experimental conditions, significant negative net flux rates (J net  = J ms  - J sm ) can only be explained by an active secretion of PhIP into the luminal compartment, and such an effect was observed in the rat distal colon, but not in the proximal jejunum. Moreover, the data obtained suggest that the breast cancer resistance protein, the multidrug resistance protein 4 and P-glycoprotein are not involved in the active secretion of PhIP in the rat distal colon. The potential role of PhIP transport in colon carcinogenesis is discussed.
In previous studies, we identified a locus for schizophrenia on 6q23.3 and proposed the Abelson helper integration site 1 (AHI1) as the candidate gene. AHI1 is expressed in the brain and plays a key role in neurodevelopment, is involved in Joubert syndrome, and has been recently associated with autism. The neurodevelopmental role of AHI1 fits with etiological hypotheses of schizophrenia. To definitively confirm our hypothesis, we searched for associations using a dense map of the region. Our strongest findings lay within the AHI1 gene: single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs11154801 and rs7759971 showed significant associations (P=6.23E-06; P=0.84E-06) and haplotypes gave P values in the 10E-8 to 10E-10 range. The second highest significant region maps close to AHI1 and includes the intergenic region between BC040979 and PDE7B (rs2038549 at P=9.70E-06 and rs1475069 at P=6.97E-06), and PDE7B and MAP7. Using a sample of Palestinian Arab families to confirm these findings, we found isolated signals. While these results did not retain their significance after correction for multiple testing, the joint analysis across the 2 samples supports the role of AHI1, despite the presence of heterogeneity. Given the hypothesis of positive selection of schizophrenia genes, we resequenced a 11 kb region within AHI1 in ethnically defined populations and found evidence for a selective sweep. Network analysis indicates 2 haplotype clades, with schizophrenia-susceptibility haplotypes clustering within the major clade. In conclusion, our data support the role of AHI1 as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia and confirm it has been subjected to positive selection, also shedding light on new possible candidate genes, MAP7 and PDE7B.
A 31-year-old body-builder taking anabolic steroids, amphetamines, frumil (frusemide and amiloride), and potassium supplements collapsed with a myocardial infarction. His serum potassium was 6.7 mmol/l and he had a run of ventricular tachycardia. He was unaware of the effects of the drugs on the heart.
Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are well-known causes of orofacial angioedema, angioedema from these agents involving the bowel is not often considered. We report a case of simultaneous onset of small bowel and orofacial angioedema due to captopril. A 61-year-old black man with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure had been treated with captopril for 5 years. He had sudden swelling of the lips, face, and tongue, followed by nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Other medications included aspirin, indomethacin, allopurinol, colchicine, and nifedipine. Examination showed swelling of the tongue, buccal mucosa, and neck; he also had midabdominal tenderness but no respiratory distress. Laboratory data were normal. A C1-esterase inhibitor level was normal. An ileus pattern was present on abdominal x-ray film. Angioedema was diagnosed, and all signs and symptoms resolved in 24 hours after captopril was discontinued. Clinicians need to be vigilant for bowel involvement from ACEI angioedema.
