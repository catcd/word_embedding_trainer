This study investigated the role of 5-lipoxygenase in the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure (MOF) induced by zymosan.
Male mice with a targeted disruption of the 5-lipoxygenase gene (5-LOKO) and littermate wild-type (WT) controls (5-LOWT) were used to evaluate the role of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) in the pathogenesis of MOF.
University research laboratory.
MOF was induced by peritoneal injection of zymosan (500 mg/kg i.p. as a suspension in saline) in 5-LOWT and in 5-LOKO mice. MOF was assessed 18 h after administration of zymosan and monitored for 12 days (for loss of body weight and mortality).
A severe inflammatory process induced by zymosan administration in WT mice coincided with the damage of lung and small intestine, as assessed by histological examination. Myeloperoxidase activity indicative of neutrophil infiltration and lipid peroxidation were significantly increased in zymosan-treated WT mice. Zymosan in the WT mice also induced a significant increase in the plasma level of nitrite/nitrate. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated a marked increase in the immunoreactivity to ICAM-1 and P-selectin in the lung and intestine of zymosan-treated WT mice. In contrast, the degree of (a) peritoneal inflammation and tissue injury, (b) upregulation/expression of P-selectin and ICAM-1, and (c) neutrophil infiltration were markedly reduced in intestine and lung tissue obtained from zymosan-treated 5-LO deficient mice. Zymosan-treated 5-LOKO showed also a significantly decreased mortality.
These findings clearly demonstrate that 5-LO exerts a role in zymosan-induced nonseptic shock.
Cholestatic liver injury was experimentally induced in rats by administration of chlorpromazine (CPZ). The peak activity of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (AST) released in serum was found to precede the peak of total AST activity. The liver mitochondria obtained from rats treated with CPZ was fractionated into two subfractions: one containing the intermembrane space, and the other containing the matrix and the membranes. As a results, the relative activity of AST in the intermembrane space was significantly increased at 12 h after CPZ administration. This result suggests that mitochondrial AST, which is dominantly located in the mitochondrial matrix, transmigrated to the intermembrane space via the inner membrane under the effect of CPZ administration.
We have shown previously that when postsynaptic NMDA receptors are blocked, the frequency, but not amplitude, of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) at synapses in the entorhinal cortex is reduced by NMDA receptor antagonists, demonstrating that glutamate release is tonically facilitated by presynaptic NMDA autoreceptors. In the present study, we recorded sEPSCs using whole-cell voltage clamp in neurons in layer V in slices of the rat entorhinal cortex. Using specific antagonists for NR2A [(R)-[(S)-1-(4-bromo-phenyl)-ethylamino]-(2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-yl)-methyl]-phosphonic acid] and NR2B [(alphaR, betaS)-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-beta-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol hydrochloride (Ro 25-6981)] subunit-containing receptors, we confirmed that in slices from juvenile rats (4-6 weeks of age), the autoreceptor is predominantly of the NR1-NR2B subtype. In older (4-6 months of age) control animals, the effect of the NR2B antagonist was less marked, suggesting a decline in autoreceptor function with development. In slices from rats (aged 4-6 months) exhibiting spontaneous recurrent seizures induced with a lithium-pilocarpine protocol, Ro 25-6981 again robustly reduced sEPSC frequency. The effect was equal to or greater than that seen in the juvenile slices and much more pronounced than that seen in the age-matched control animals. In all three groups, the NR2A antagonist was without effect on sEPSCs. These results suggest that there is a developmental decrease in NMDA autoreceptor function, which is reversed in a chronic epileptic condition. The enhanced autoreceptor function may contribute to seizure susceptibility and epileptogenesis in temporal lobe structures.
1. The relationships between plasma noradrenaline concentration at rest and blood pressure, as well as increase in forearm blood flow in response to a brachial artery infusion of the alpha-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent phentolamine, were investigated in hypertensive and normotensive subjects of similar age. 2. In 44 hypertensive patients plasma noradrenaline correlated with systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures, but no difference in the mean plasma noradrenaline concentration was found. 3. In 11 patients and 14 normotensive subjects alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade resulted in a similar increase in forearm blood flow. Only in the patients, however, was this increase related to plasma noradrenaline and blood pressure. 4. In patients with established essential hypertension plasma noradrenaline can be considered to be a marker of alpha-adrenoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction, which, in part, determines the height of the blood pressure.
Plumbago zeylanica L. root is widely used in Indian medicine to treat diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the antidiabetic effects of plumbagin isolated from P. zeylanica L. root and its effect on GLUT4 translocation in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Plumbagin (15 and 30 mg/kg b wt) was orally administered to STZ-induced diabetic rats for 28 days. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed on 21st day. The effect of plumbagin on body weight, blood glucose, plasma insulin, total protein, urea, creatinine, liver glycogen, plasma enzymes (SGOT, SGPT and ALP) and carbohydrate metabolism enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and hexokinase) were investigated. GLUT4 mRNA and protein expression in skeletal muscles were also studied. Plumbagin significantly reduced the blood glucose and significantly altered all other biochemical parameters to near normal. Further, plumbagin increased the activity of hexokinase and decreased the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase significantly in treated diabetic rats. Enhanced GLUT4 mRNA and protein expression were observed in diabetic rats after treatment with plumbagin. The results indicated that plumbagin enhanced GLUT4 translocation and contributed to glucose homeostasis. It could be further probed for use as a drug to treat diabetes.
The aim of the study was the evaluation of the influence of 4-month concomitant tiagabine (TGB) and valproic acid (VPA) or carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy on renal function of epileptic children and teenagers. Initial parameter values, indicated on renal disfunction, were compared with these obtained after VPA and TGB or CBZ and TGB therapy and with values in healthy children and teenagers. Investigation group was composed of 22 children and teenagers with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We observed that in the time of concomitant VPA and TGB therapy increased the NAG/g creatinine activity index. In spite the fact of statistical significance of these changes, they were not outside the normal range. beta 2-microglobulin concentrations in urine of epileptic children treated with VPA in monotherapy before concomitant therapy with TGB were higher than in control group. That difference was statistically significant. Addition of TGB to the therapy normalized this parameter. During concomitant VPA and TGB or CBZ and TGB therapy we didn't observe statistically significant changes of parameters indicating on glomerular disfunction. In the VPA therapy before concomitant treatment with tiagabine the disfunction of tubules and glomerules was observed. On the other side in the concomitant VPA and TGB therapy the disfunction of tubules and glomerules didn't occurred. We can conclude that concomitant therapy VPA or CBZ with tiagabine don't affect the renal function in clinical significant manner. Therapy with VPA could leads to minimal disfunction of tubules what is represented by increasing of beta 2-microglobulin level in urine.
Vasculitis is a rare complication of propylthiouracil therapy. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) have been described in association with several vasculitic disorders. We report detection of ANCA against human neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, and myeloperoxidase in serum from six patients who developed evidence of vasculitis during propylthiouracil treatment of hyperthyroidism. On withdrawal of the drug ANCA concentrations fell and clinical symptoms resolved completely.
This work evaluates the antinociceptive and constipating effects of the combination of 3.2 mg/kg s.c. morphine with 177.8 mg/kg s.c. metamizol in acutely and chronically treated (once a day for 12 days) rats. On the 13th day, antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception, pain-induced functional impairment model, and the charcoal meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit. Simultaneous administration of morphine with metamizol resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single (298+/-7 vs. 139+/-36 units area (ua); P<0.001) and repeated administration (280+/-17 vs. 131+/-22 ua; P<0.001). Antinociceptive effect of morphine was reduced in chronically treated rats (39+/-10 vs. 18+/-5 au) while the combination-induced antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment (298+/-7 vs. 280+/-17 au). Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3.2 mg/kg naloxone s.c. (P<0.05), suggesting the partial involvement of the opioidergic system in the synergism observed. In independent groups, morphine inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+/-4% and 38+/-4% after acute and chronic treatment, respectively, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the constipating effects. The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by morphine regardless of the time of treatment, suggesting that metamizol did not potentiate morphine-induced constipation. These findings show a significant interaction between morphine and metamizol in chronically treated rats, suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of chronic pain.
The effect of central renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on one-kidney Grollman hypertension during the maintaining phase and its mechanism were investigated in rats. The arterial blood pressure (ABP) and the content of angiotensin II (A II) and norepinephrine (NE) in brain regions was measured respectively. 4 weeks after operation the ABP was elevated significantly, and it sustained at high level 8 weeks post-operatively. However, ABP in the control group underwent no significant changes at the same period. The A II and the NE content in the brain regions of the operated group were significantly higher than in those of the age-matched control group. During the maintaining phase of hypertension captopril (150 micrograms/10 microliters) was injected into the lateral cerebroventricle at 0.5 h, 1.0 h and 1.5 h respectively, and ABP and content of A II and NE were determined at the corresponding time. The results showed that the above three parameters decreased consistently at 0.5 h and 1.0 h, and increased gradually at 1.5 h, suggesting that the central RAS might play an important role in the maintaining phase of one-kidney Grollman hypertension in rats.
The effects of fructose-1,6-diphosphate, an intermediate metabolite of glycolysis, on acute and chronic cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin were investigated in rats. In the acute study, urethane-anaesthetized Wistar female rats treated with 10 mg/kg i.v. doxorubicin developed a widening of the S alpha T segment, an impairment of +dP/dtmax, and tachycardia. Pretreatment with 375 and 750 mg/kg i.p. fructose-1,6-diphosphate prevented the S alpha T segment from widening, whereas only 750 mg/kg i.p. significantly attenuated the heart rate increase. Chronic cardiomyopathy was induced over a 6-week period by weekly doses of 3 mg/kg i.v. doxorubicin, being characterized in vivo by the progressive enlargement of the S alpha T segment and the occurrence of histological alterations and in vitro by a marked impairment of the inotropic response elicited by adrenaline in isolated hearts from treated rats. Concurrent treatment with 150 and 300 mg/kg i.p. fructose-1,6-diphosphate thrice a week for 6 weeks did not lessen the chronic heart damage, whereas 600 mg/kg given i.p. significantly reduced the widening of the S alpha T segment and the severity of histological damage in vivo, as well as significantly improving the contractile responses of hearts in vitro. These findings suggest that the administration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate plays a protective role in the acute and chronic cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin in the rat.
3 cases of carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced Stokes-Adams attacks caused by intermittent total atrioventricular block, sino-atrial block with junctional escapade-rhytm and intermittent asystolia are reported. After cessation of CBZ treatment, the cardiac conduction disturbances disappeared. In 2 of the patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by resumption of treatment with CBZ after insertion of a demand pacemaker. If syncopes or changes in seizure-type occur in patients treated with CBZ, evaluation of cardiac conduction is recommended. Furthermore, it is recommended that cardiac function is evaluated before CBZ-treatment, especially in elderly patients.
For the last 30 years urolithiasis incidence in Kirghizia has been growing. Its prevalence is the highest in Chu and Osh rural areas (89%) where farmers widely use toxic insecticides. Urban population develop the disease more often (63%), especially employees (57.7%) versus workers (27.7%). Urolithiasis occurs in workers 8 times more frequently than in farmers. Food products contain insecticides in quantities much higher than MAC. The contamination concerns fruit and vegetables in a lesser and meat, milk products in greater degrees. In renal tissue, blood, urine of urolithiasis patients concentrations of the chemicals were increased 4 times against the control samples. In renal tissue and fat of urolithiasis animals nephrotoxic insecticides levels surpassed those in the controls 2-3 times. Uroliths contain chemicals in great concentrations also. Basing on the conformity of geography of insecticides us a ge with urolithiasis epidemiological data, high concentrations of the chemicals in food and biological objects, frequent occurrence of recurrent urolithiasis in patients known to acquire high chemicals levels in renal tissue and urine, it is inferred that toxic chemicals are involved in nephrolithiasis genesis by tubular impairment.
The relationship between diurnal fluctuations in free (unbound) and total plasma carbamazepine levels and the appearance of intermittent side effects was investigated in nine epileptic patients receiving chronic therapy with carbamazepine, alone or in combination with phenobarbital. On a three-times-daily or four-times-daily dosing schedule, both total and free carbamazepine levels fluctuated considerably (on an average, 41 and 45%, respectively, around the mean). Side effects (particularly diplopia and nystagmus) were observed in five patients and showed an intermittent pattern in four. Side effects were never found at total carbamazepine levels less than 34 mumol/L but invariably appeared at levels greater than 38 mumol/L. At levels between 34 and 38 mumol/L adverse effects were inconsistently observed. The correlation between plasma carbamazepine levels and manifestations of toxicity was slightly stronger when free rather than total levels were considered. Side effects were always apparent at free levels greater than 7.2 mumol/L. These data underline the limitations of relying on a single drug level determination during the monitoring of carbamazepine therapy and emphasize the necessity of carefully adjusting the dosing schedule, to minimize the appearance of intermittent adverse effects.
Intrahepatic cholestasis and cutaneous bullae associated with glibenclamide therapy are described in a 61-year-old diabetic patient who presented wit hypoglycaemic coma. These features have not previously been reported as side effects of glibenclamide therapy, but intrahepatic cholestasis may occur with chlorpropamide, a similar sulphonylurea agent. The mechanism of this cholestasis is not clear at present.
1. Renin-associated, chronic psychosocial hypertension of 150-160 mmHg develops in groups of mice interacting socially in complex population cages. 2. The blood pressures of 16 males in a cage were measured and an intraperitoneal injection of the angiotensin coverting enzyme inhibitor captopril (SQ 14,225) was given. Three hours later blood pressures were measured again. 3. During the first 3 weeks of psychosocial hypertension SQ 14,225 was without effect. But at 1 month and subsequently up to 7 months, SQ 14,225 reduced blood pressure to the normal range of 120-130 mmHg. 4. Plasma renin activities were not related to the extent of blood pressure reduction by SQ 14,225. Hence other factors in addition to the renin-angiotensin mechanism play a part in maintaining chronic psychosocial hypertension.
Dexamethasone is clinically applied in preterm infants to treat or prevent chronic lung disease. However, concern has emerged about adverse side effects. The cardiovascular short-term side effects of neonatal dexamethasone treatment are well documented, but long-term consequences are unknown. Previous studies showed suppressed mitosis during dexamethasone treatment, leading to reduced ventricular weight, depressed systolic function, and compensatory dilatation in prepubertal rats. In addition, recent data indicated a reduced life expectancy. Therefore, we investigated the long-term effects of neonatal dexamethasone treatment on cardiovascular function. Neonatal rats were treated with dexamethasone or received saline. Cardiac function was determined in 8-, 50-, and 80-wk-old animals, representing young adult, middle-aged, and elderly stages. A pressure-conductance catheter was introduced into the left ventricle to measure pressure-volume loops. Subsequently, the hearts were collected for histological examination. Our results showed reduced ventricular and body weights in dexamethasone-treated rats at 8 and 80 wk, but not at 50 wk. Cardiac output and diastolic function were unchanged, but systolic function was depressed at 50 and 80 wk, evidenced by reduced ejection fractions and rightward shifts of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationships. We concluded that previously demonstrated early adverse effects of neonatal dexamethasone treatment are transient but that reduced ventricular weight and systolic dysfunction become manifest again in elderly rats. Presumably, cellular hypertrophy initially compensates for the dexamethasone treatment-induced lower number of cardiomyocytes, but this mechanism falls short at a later stage, leading to systolic dysfunction. If applicable to humans, cardiac screening of a relatively large patient group to enable secondary prevention may be indicated.
Hexachlorophene (HCP)-induced intramyelinic vacuolation was studied in the transitional region of the trigeminal root of suckling and adult mice. HCP produced an extensive vacuolation in the central compartment of the region in both suckling and adult mice, while in the peripheral compartment myelin lesions were only seen in mice less than 16 days of age. Gas chromatographic measurements showed that in suckling mice the blood concentration of HCP decreased with age, apparently reflecting a faster elimination of HCP from the blood. By substantially increasing the HCP dose, higher blood concentrations were obtained in adult than less the 16-day-old mice; in spite of this, PNS myelin changes occurred only in the latter. Thus, by observing the HCP effect on the transitional region, where CNS and PNS directly meet, it is concluded that CNS of both suckling and adult mice is more severely effected by HCP than PNS, and that the reaction of the PNS myelin is age-dependent during the period of myelinogenesis; it is particularly vulnerable to a cytotoxic edema inducing substance.
Methamphetamine interacts with sigma (σ) receptors and AC927, a selective σ receptor ligand, protects against methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. In the present study, the effects of AC927 on methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia and striatal serotonergic neurotoxicity were evaluated. Male, Swiss Webster mice were injected (i.p.) every 2 h, for a total of four times, with one of the following treatments: Saline+Saline; Saline+Methamphetamine (5 mg/kg); AC927 (5, 10, 20 mg/kg)+Methamphetamine (5 mg/kg); or AC927 (5, 10, 20 mg/kg)+Saline. Pretreatment with AC927 (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated methamphetamine-induced striatal serotonin depletions, striatal serotonin transporter reductions, and hyperthermia. At the doses tested, AC927 itself had no significant effects on serotonin levels, serotonin transporter expression, or body temperature. To evaluate the effects of higher ambient temperature on methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity, groups of mice were treated at 37 °C. Overall, there was an inverse correlation between the body temperature of the animals and striatal serotonin levels. Together, the data suggest that AC927 (10 mg/kg) protects against methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. The reduction of methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia by AC927 may contribute to the observed neuroprotection in vivo.
We studied 15 patients with chronic coronary artery disease (13 men aged 62 +/- 8 years) undergoing dobutamine (5 to 40 microg/kg/min) echocardiography at the end of two 15-day treatment periods with placebo and trimetazidine (20 mg 3 times daily) given in random order, according to a double-blind, crossover design. Results show that trimetazidine improves resting left ventricular function and reduces the severity of dobutamine-induced ischemic myocardial dysfunction.
The aim of the study was to describe describe the frequency of depressive symptoms and episodes accompanying peg-interferon alpha and ribavirin (peg-IFN-alpha/RBV) treatment of chronic hepatitis C patients (CHC).
47 CHC patients were enrolled in the study. They were divided into two groups: experimental and control consisting of 26 and 21 participants, respectively. Experimental group patients were given peg-IFN-alpha/RBV2a (n = 18) or 2b (n = 9) and ribavirin treatment in doses recommended by manufacturers. Control group patients did not receive the above treatment. Both groups underwent psychiatric examination using semi-structured clinical interview (MINI) at the beginning (t0) and after 12 weeks of treatment or observation (t12). Depressive episodes were diagnosed according to ICD-10 criteria. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) was used to assess depressive symptoms intensity at the same time points.
Three and two participants in the control and experimental group were diagnosed with depression in t0. Six new patients developed depression in t12 twelve weeks after peg-IFN-alpha/RBV treatment. No new cases were seen in the control group. There was also observed a significant increase in depressive symptoms intensity during peg-IFN-alpha/RBV treatment. No significant changes in the frequency of depressive episodes and their intensity were seen in the control group over the period of observation.
The findings suggest a connection between peg-IFN-alpha/RBV therapy and the development of depressive symptoms and episodes. The above changes may be the effect of IFN-alpha-induced neurotransmission abnormalities in limbic system and basal ganglia. The above findings necessitate a routine psychiatrist involvement in the management of CHC.
We report an hydrogen sulfite intoxication which occurred in a Senegalese chemical plant and which lead to the death of three temporary workers in charge of cleaning up the pumping basin of seawater. Hydogen sulfite was generated by the decomposition of seaweeds and other inorganic compounds. Agitation of water due to human presence increased the air concentration at very high levels. The death of workers trying to rescue their colleagues was due to their ignorance of key elementary prevention rules. Diagnosis was based upon microbiologic analysis and air sampling. The ignorance of toxicologic effects of this widespread substance invite to inform people working in industries where the risk of hydrogen sulfite intoxication is high.
Neurotoxicity developed in 22 of 97 children and adolescents with malignant solid tumors treated within a phase II ifosfamide protocol. The occurrence of neurotoxicity was related to previous cumulative dosages of cisplatin. One third of the patients who had received more than 600 mg/m2 of cisplatin developed this complication. The relative risk increased 3.2-fold with previous cisplatin dosages above 301 to 600 mg/m2, and 4.1-fold with dosages of 601 to 1,340 mg/m2. The increased risk of neurotoxicity in patients who had received more than 600 mg/m2 of cisplatin may be related to either a decreased clearance of ifosfamide itself or of the drug's active metabolites.
Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic, neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by motor dysfunction, cognitive decline and psychiatric disturbances. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) is an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which thereby reduces production of ATP. It induces neurotoxicity by causing striatal degeneration, energy deficit and oxidative stress. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is an important protease in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) responsible for the conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. Angiotensin-II stimulates mitochondrial oxidant release leading to depression of energy metabolism. ACE inhibitors have shown promise in disorders like stress, anxiety, and depression in addition to showing beneficial effects in cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's. Angiotensin-II inhibition enhances energy production by lowering mitochondrial oxidant production, and hence protects mitochondrial structure. Trandolapril is a centrally active ACE inhibitor. 3-NP administered systematically (20mg/kg, i.p) for 4 days consecutively induced HD like symptoms - loss of body weight, neurobehavioral alterations like memory dysfunction (elevated plus maze, Morris water maze performance), Hind-limb impairment (Narrow beam test), motor incoordination (locomotor activity). Biochemical studies on brain tissue showed increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite levels and acetylcholinesterase activity along with decreased levels of reduced glutathione, catalase activity. Mitochondrial enzyme complex activities (I, II, IV and MTT assay) were found to be significantly lowered in brain mitochondria. Administration of Trandolapril (4 and 6 mg/kg, p.o) daily for 12 days showed significant improvement in body weight, neurobehavioral parameters, oxidative stress and mitochondrial enzyme activities in rat brain. These findings were further confirmed by histopathological studies which showed improvement in 3-NP induced brain lesions. This study indicates that Trandolapril could be an effective treatment option for the management of HD.
Activation of inflammatory mechanisms contributes to cerebrovascular pathophysiology. Male gender is associated with increased stroke risk, yet little is known about the effects of testosterone in the cerebral circulation. Therefore, we explored the impact of testosterone treatment on cerebrovascular inflammation with both in vivo and in vitro models of inflammation. We hypothesized that testosterone would augment the expression of two vascular markers of cellular inflammation, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Using four groups of male rats [intact, orchiectomized (ORX), and ORX treated with either testosterone (ORXT) or the testosterone metabolite 17beta-estradiol (ORXE)], we determined effects of the sex hormones on cerebrovascular inflammation after intraperitoneal LPS injection. Western blot analysis showed that induction of inflammatory markers was increased in cerebral blood vessels from ORXT rats compared with intact or ORX rats. In contrast, in cerebral blood vessels from ORXE rats, there was a significant decrease in endotoxin-induced COX-2 and iNOS protein levels. Confocal microscopy of cerebral blood vessels from ORXT rats showed increased COX-2 and iNOS immunoreactivity in both endothelial and smooth muscle cells after LPS treatment. In vitro incubation with LPS also induced COX-2 in pial vessels isolated from the four animal treatment groups, with the greatest induction observed in ORXT vessels compared with the ORX and ORXE groups. Production of PGE2, a principal COX-2-derived prostaglandin end product, was also greatest in cerebral vessels isolated from ORXT rats. In conclusion, testosterone increases cerebrovascular inflammation; this effect may contribute to stroke differences between men and women.
Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing CpG motifs, characteristic of bacterial DNA, are currently being evaluated as vaccine adjuvants for inducing protective immunity. Recently, there is increasing pressure to vaccinate pregnant women against maternally transmitted diseases including AIDS and tetanus, as well as against potential bio-weapons such as anthrax. CpG vaccines are effective because they trigger transient increases in T(H)1 cytokine production. Recent literature suggests, however, that a shift toward a T(H)1 cytokine profile during pregnancy may increase the risk of fetal morphologic defects. On this basis, we hypothesized that exposure to CpG motifs during pregnancy could result in T(H)1 inflammation leading to adverse effects on fetal development. To address this hypothesis, pregnant C57BL/6 mice were injected with CpG ODN (0-300 microg/dam) and maternal and fetal outcomes were determined. Injection of dams with the highest dose of CpG ODN resulted in markedly increased fetal resorptions and craniofacial/limb defects, while lower doses had little, if any effects. Histological examination of placentas revealed cellular necrosis with mixed inflammation and calcification in the spongiotrophoblast layer and dysregulation of labyrinthine vascular development. Concomitant elevations in maternal serum cytokine levels were observed including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10 and IL-12. Treatment with 300 microg of non-CpG ODN did not cause any adverse effects. The 300 microg dose of CpG ODN used in the present study is 30-fold higher than the highest dose that has been administered to humans during clinical trials. These results suggest that the induction of T(H)1 cytokines during pregnancy by CpG motifs may potentially increase the risk of fetal loss and morphologic defects in mice, at least at high doses, and support the need for further investigation of teratogenesis that may result from exposure to vaccine adjuvants designed to produce T(H)1 cytokine profile shifts.
Cerebral cortical blood flow (lCoBF) and metabolic rate for oxygen (lCoMRO2) were studied in eight patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm clipping. The patients were anesthetized with fentanyl 10 micrograms/kg and 70% nitrous oxide combined with 30% oxygen. Hypotension was induced with isoflurane. A thermal diffusion probe was used to measure lCoBF, and arterial and cerebral venous blood samples were obtained for measurement of arterio-cerebral venous O2 content difference. Measurements were made prior to hypotension, during hypotension (to mean arterial pressure approximately 50 mmHg), and posthypotension. Mean lCoBF decreased from 69 +/- 20 mL/100 g/min at normotension to 59 +/- 13 mL/100 g/min during hypotension (P less than .03, NS) and was 61 +/- 18 mL/100 g/min upon return to normotension (all values mean +/- 1 SD). The lCoMRO2 averaged 3.9 +/- 1.6 mL/100 g/min and 3.1 +/- 1.5 mL/100 g/min, respectively (P less than .03, NS) for normotension upsilon hypotension. Values for cerebral venous PO2 and O2 saturation also did not differ significantly between study periods. These results indicate that isoflurane-induced hypotension during fentanyl-nitrous oxide anesthesia allows maintenance of a constant lCoBF and oxygen delivery.
