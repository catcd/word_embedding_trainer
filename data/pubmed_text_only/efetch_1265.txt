To clarify the effect of L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-threo-DOPS), a precursor of norepinephrine (NE), the effect of this drug on microneurographically recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSA) from the tibial nerve was analyzed in ten healthy male volunteers. A single dose of 600 mg of L-threo-DOPS was orally administered and the effect of this norepinephrine precursor on MSA at resting and at upright standing positions, as well as the MSA responsiveness to head-up tilting was examined by comparing the data obtained after administration of the drug with those obtained under control conditions. The plasma NE levels were determined in two subjects. The results were as follows: (1) resting MSA increased significantly 80 min after administration of L-threo-DOPS and was accompanied by an increase in plasma NE levels; (2) standing MSA when treated with the drug was not significantly different from values obtained under control conditions; and (3) MSA responsiveness to orthostasis was reduced after L-threo-DOPS. We conclude from the activation of MSA by L-threo-DOPS that this drug raised blood pressure not only through an increase in metabolized plasma NE levels, but also through the enhancement of MSA by activation of descending noradrenergic or adrenergic pathways proximal to the recording site of the sympathetic discharge.
Five patients had amiodarone hepatotoxicity detected on routine biochemical monitoring. Symptoms attributable to hepatotoxicity were minimal or absent; reversible hepatomegaly was seen in two patients, whereas three patients had signs of nonhepatic amiodarone toxicity before or with hepatotoxicity. Serum aminotransferase levels were elevated in all patients and alkaline phosphatase levels in four; no patient had hyperbilirubinemia or prolongation of the prothrombin time. Light microscopy showed steatosis, cellular degeneration, and cellular necrosis in the biopsy samples of four patients, whereas the fifth patient's sample had a granulomatous injury pattern. Electron microscopic study of liver tissue done in two patients showed phospholipid-laden lysosomal lamellar bodies. These findings suggest that both toxic and hypersensitivity liver injury can occur in response to amiodarone. The presence of phospholipid-laden lysosomal lamellar bodies may help differentiate amiodarone hepatotoxicity from alcoholic liver disease or other causes of hepatic steatosis.
Polycythaemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythaemia (ET) are classified as Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative diseases. Both PV and ET are rare diseases, but the prevalence is high. Patients who have not been treated for the diseases are at great risk of morbidity and mortality as a result of thrombohaemorrhagic events. However, if patients have been well treated, their prognosis is good and life-expectancy approaches normal. This article provides diagnostic tools and flowcharts for treatment of PV and ET. Treatment of PV and ET should be risk-adjusted and individualised. Low-dose aspirin is recommended as an antiaggregative drug in both diseases. For PV, phlebotomy to control a haematocrit at <0.45 is the cornerstone in treatment, and treatment with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) or interferon (IFN)-alpha is added to reduce hypermetabolic symptoms or splenomegaly becoming cytoreductive. In ET, hydroxycarbamide and anagrelide are the most used drugs, and anagrelide may also be added in PV to reduce thrombocytosis. IFNalpha is the only myelosuppressive treatment available during pregnancy. Current controversies regarding treatment illustrate the need for more randomised clinical trials. Demonstration of over expression of the PV-1 gene and in particular the JAK-2 mutation will be novel diagnostic criteria and may have an impact for future therapy of both PV and ET.
Guidelines for doses of nortriptyline are generally somewhat vague and usually recommend a fairly wide dose range. Additionally, the safety and utility of beginning treatment at higher initial doses have not been adequately investigated.
Nortriptyline treatment was initiated with a 75- to 125-mg dose depending on weight in 26 depressed inpatients in an open-label study.
The mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score decreased by 45% within 1 week (p < .001) and remained essentially unchanged at the end of Week 2. Orthostatic hypotension was the side effect of major concern since it is virtually the only significant cardiovascular effect in young healthy individuals treated with tricyclic antidepressant medication. Only 2 patients developed orthostasis, which required additional treatment with fludrocortisone, and no patients were dropped from the study due to side effects. None of the patients evidenced significant ECG changes. Twenty-one patients (81%) reached therapeutic drug levels on the initial dose regimen by the end of Week 1.
Subjects tolerated high initial doses well and appeared to reach significant benefit within the first week. However, double-blind controlled studies are needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.
Chronic administration of typical neuroleptics is known to cause persistent oral dyskinesia in rats, an alleged animal model of tardive dyskinesia (TD). The pathophysiology of the syndrome remains unclear. Adenosine is now widely accepted as the major inhibitory neuromodulators in the central nervous system besides gamma-aminobutyric acid. Based on the hypothesis that adenosinergic receptor system may involve in the pathogenesis of TD, we investigated the effect of dipyridamole (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.), an adenosine reuptake inhibitor and nimodipine (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) an adenosine transport inhibitor in haloperidol-induced TD by using different behavioural, biochemical and neurochemical parameters in rats. Chronic administration of haloperidol (1 mg/kg, i.p., for 21 days) significantly increased vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusion, facial jerking which was prevented by adenosine reuptake inhibitors. Chronic administration of haloperidol also resulted in the development of dopamine sensitivity as suggested by increased locomotor activity and stereotypy and decreased % retention time on elevated plus maze paradigm. Pretreatment with adenosine reuptake/transport inhibitors, dipyridamole and nimodipine prevented all these behavioural changes. Chronic administration of haloperidol also resulted in increased oxidative damage in all brain regions which was prevented dose-dependently by both dipyridamole and nimodipine in different brain regions. Chronic administration of haloperidol resulted in decreased turnover of dopamine and norepinephrine in both cortex and subcortical regions which was dose-dependently prevented by adenosine reuptake/transport inhibitors. The major findings of the present study suggested that adenosine reuptake inhibitors dipyridamole and nimodipine could be a possible therapeutic option in neuroleptic induced TD.
A case of a renal transplant recipient with colchicine-induced myopathy is presented. He was on colchicine therapy for 10 months. He was hospitalized for investigation of fatigue, severe myalgia in the lower extremities and elevated serum aminotransferase levels. His viral markers and other factors that may cause myalgia and that may increase the serum aminotransferase levels were either normal or negative. Creatine phosphokinase (CK) levels were normal. Electrophysiological findings indicated myopathy and muscle biopsy was consistent with vacuolar myopathy. After withdrawal of colchicine, the symptoms disappeared gradually and serum aminotransferase levels were normalized. We suggest that colchicine myopathy should be taken into account in patients who have been on colchicine therapy and had unexplained myalgia as well as elevated aminotransferase levels even with normal CK levels.
Niacin (nicotinic acid) is available in several forms, including crystalline preparations and various types of sustained-release preparations. Evidence exists that sustained-release niacin, with respect to both dosage and severity, is more hepatotoxic than crystalline niacin. Three patients who developed hepatitis during treatment with sustained-release niacin were rechallenged with equivalent or higher doses of crystalline niacin, with no evidence of recurring hepatocellular damage. Although the mechanism for niacin-induced hepatitis is unknown, these cases support previous observations that crystalline niacin may be less hepatotoxic than sustained-release preparations in certain patients.
We report the case of an HIV-positive patient with preexisting bone disease who developed tenofovir-induced Fanconi syndrome and subsequently sustained pathologic fractures. We suggest that tenofovir treatment may have contributed to the patient's pathologic fractures through its effects on phosphorus balance and vitamin D metabolism. This case highlights the importance of monitoring not only for renal impairment but also for bone disease in patients receiving tenofovir treatment, especially given the high prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-positive patients.
We report the medical case of a 40-year-old man with a history of years of cocaine abuse. He was admitted to our hospital for a septic process and purulent rhinorrhea. The clinical examination and craniofacial computed tomography revealed severe necrosis of the nasal septum, maxillary sinus, ethmoidal sinus, sphenoidal sinus and soft palate. In our experience, this is unusual, even for longstanding cocaine abusers.
The spontaneous nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test was done in children with nephrotic syndrome treated with prednisone and with secondary bacterial infections and in children with urinary tract infections not treated with prednisone. In healthy children 9.0 +/- 1.3% of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in peripheral blood showed presence of deposits in the NBT test. In children not treated with prednisone the number of NBT (+) leucocytes was increased over fourfold. The value of the NBT test was highest at the beginning of the disease. In children treated with prednisone the value of the NBT test increased slowly. The highest results were obtained in the second week of infection treatment. In relation to controls the proportion of NBT (+) test in peripheral blood was increased threefold.
The mechanism by which halothane, isoflurane, and nitrous oxide increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) is unknown. We assessed the cerebrovascular effects of nitrous oxide (70%; n = 6), isoflurane (1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration: 1.4%; n = 6) or halothane (1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration: 0.8%; n = 6) before and after blockade of nitric oxide (NO) synthase with 40 mg/kg N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) intravenously in dogs with baseline pentobarbital anesthesia. Baseline CBF (microspheres) was determined after 1 h of pentobarbital anesthesia. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was maintained during inhaled anesthetic or L-NAME by either hemorrhage or inflation of an intra-aortic balloon. Before L-NAME, halothane and isoflurane increased CBF (40 +/- 4 to 56 +/- 6 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1 and 43 +/- 6 to 78 +/- 12 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1, respectively) with no change in cerebral oxygen consumption (baseline: halothane, 2.6 +/- 0.2; isoflurane, 2.0 +/- 0.2 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1). On the contrary, nitrous oxide increased CBF similarly (40 +/- 6 to 57 +/- 8 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1), but increased cerebral oxygen consumption (2.2 +/- 0.3 to 3.0 +/- 0.3 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1). L-NAME decreased blood flow in the neurohypophysis by 80% with no change in blood flow in other brain regions. After L-NAME, reexposure to nitrous oxide, halothane, or isoflurane resulted in no change in CBF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
While cocaine is now used much more frequently than heroin by women of childbearing age, we have found that a significant number of mothers have abused both drugs during their pregnancy. We studied 86 infants who were born to women with a history of cocaine and/or heroin use during pregnancy. The newborns were observed over a 5-day hospital period using a standardized abstinence scoring system and urine drug screening of both mother and infant. Of these, 35 had maternal and/or newborn urine test results that were positive for cocaine only (cocaine group), 14 that were positive for heroin only (heroin group), 17 that were positive for both cocaine and heroin (cocaine/heroin group), and 20 that were negative for both, although the mothers admitted to cocaine use during their pregnancy (cocaine history group). In approximately half of the mother/infant pairs, the results of the urine drug tests were discordant. Microcephaly and growth retardation occurred most frequently in the infants in the cocaine group (17% and 27%, respectively). Microcephaly was also found to be significant in the infants in the cocaine/heroin group. Signs of drug withdrawal occurred in all four drug-exposed groups. Mild withdrawal occurred in 26% of infants in the cocaine group, 21% of the infants in the heroin group, 47% of the infants in the cocaine/heroin group, and in 30% of the infants in the cocaine history group. Withdrawal requiring treatment occurred in 6% of the infants in the cocaine group, 14% of the infants in the heroin group, 35% of infants in the cocaine/heroin group, and 5% of the infants in the cocaine history group. The use of heroin with cocaine has a synergistic effect on the behavior of the newborn.
Based on the effects of gold thioglucose (GTG), we have previously proposed a regulatory center in brain which adjusts the convulsive response to insulin hypoglycemia. The sensitivity to insulin hypoglycemic convulsions is decreased 24 hr and increased 1 week after a single i.p. injection of GTG. The differences are in the brain's convulsive response to equal hypoglycemia, as the blood glucose response to insulin is unchanged. The generalized convulsive threshold, reflected in the sensitivity to nonmetabolic pentylenetetrazol (Metrazol) convulsions, is not altered. Despite its systemic administration, GTG causes lesions focused in the ventromedial hypothalamus. In the present study, this regulatory center was explored further by the ability of two thioglucoses to substitute for GTG. beta-D-Thioglucose had no effect. 5-Thioglucose simulated the early (24 hr) action of GTG but had no effect at 1 week. However, unlike GTG, 5-thioglucose did not cause the ventromedial hypothalamus lesion. The early (24 hr) and late (1 week) components are thus dissociated. The early effect on insulin hypoglycemic convulsions does not require a ventromedial hypothalamus lesion. Structure-activity relationships and relationships to glucoregulatory systems are discussed.
Vascular tumors occur in approximately 10% of all infants and may be associated with significant morbidity. Available therapies for vascular tumors, such as systemic corticosteroids, vincristine, and interferon-alpha, may cause toxicity, limiting their use to complicated cases. Using a mouse hemangioendothelioma model, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of imiquimod, a topically applied inducer of cytokines. Application of imiquimod cream, whether initiated at the time of cell inoculation or when tumors became visible, significantly decreased tumor growth and increased animal survival in comparison with control mice. Imiquimod-treated tumors showed decreased tumor cell proliferation, increased tumor apoptosis, and increased expression of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 with decreased activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9. The demonstration that local application of imiquimod inhibits vascular tumor enlargement in the mouse vascular tumor model suggests a novel, less toxic means of treating infantile hemangioendotheliomas and perhaps other cutaneous vascular tumors.
The lung epithelia facilitate wound closure by secretion of various cytokines and growth factors. Nerve growth factor (NGF) has been well described in airway inflammation; however, its likely role in lung repair has not been examined thus far. To investigate the repair function of NGF, experiments were performed in vitro using cultured alveolar epithelial cells and in vivo using a naphthalene-induced model of Clara epithelial cell injury. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed airway epithelial cell proliferation following injury to be dependent on NGF and the expression of its receptor, tropomyosin-receptor-kinase A. Additionally, NGF also augmented in vitro migration of alveolar type II cells. In vivo, transgenic mice over-expressing NGF in Clara cells (NGFtg) did not reveal any proliferation or alteration in Clara cell phenotype. However, following Clara cell specific injury, proliferation was increased in NGFtg and impaired upon inhibition of NGF. Furthermore, NGF also promoted the expression of collagen I and fibronectin in vitro and in vivo during repair, where significantly higher levels were measured in re-epithelialising NGFtg mice. Our study demonstrates that NGF promotes the proliferation of lung epithelium in vitro and the renewal of Clara cells following lung injury in vivo.
Endothelium-dependent and independent hypotension, vasodilation and relaxation were examined comparatively, in vivo and in vitro, in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). In conscious and unrestrained animals, the dose-dependent hypotensive responses to both acetylcholine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were attenuated in SHR, compared to findings in the WKY, while sodium nitroprusside lowered mean arterial pressure (MAP), to a similar degree in SHR and WKY. Acetylcholine, ATP and nitroprusside increased the heart rate of SHR and WKY, in a dose-related manner. Mesenteric and femoral blood flow was altered by acetylcholine, ATP and nitroprusside, in a similar manner in the SHR and WKY anesthetized with urethane. However, an ATP-induced reduction in renal blood flow was greater in the SHR than in the WKY. Acetylcholine and nitroprusside led to a concentration-dependent relaxation in the isolated mesenteric artery, to a similar extent in both strains of rats. The relaxation response to acetylcholine was nearly abolished by mechanical removal of the endothelium, but the nitroprusside-induced relaxation was not altered by this denudation. ATP did not influence contraction of the mesentric artery but did produce endothelium-dependent relaxation of aorta, in a dose-dependent manner. All these events suggest that suppression of the endothelium dependent relaxation of resistant arterioles relates to the maintenance of hypertension, in the SHR.
The electrophysiological tolerability of ioxaglate (160 mgI/ml) and iohexol (140 mgI/ml) was assessed in rabbits (n = 12 per group). There was a significant induction of ventricular fibrillation in the group given iohexol. An explanation for this phenomenon could be the lack of sodium in this preparation. Ioxaglate, iopamidol and iohexol (all at 320 mgI/ml) were also compared during coronary angiography in the dog (n = 10) after bolus administration, using the carotid approach (5 and 8 ml-0.5 ml/sec). Each dog received all the compounds in the left coronary artery and selectively in the left anterior descending artery, at random. Four dogs had lethal ventricular fibrillations after iohexol. Iopamidol and iohexol induced significant bradycardia in comparison with saline. A biphasic effect on myocardial contractility was observed with all contrast media: a short-lasting, typical decrease in dP/dt was seen with ioxaglate by the end of injection, while iohexol and iopamidol caused a similar negative inotropic effect in some cases (25%) after increasing dP/dt. The positive inotropic effect was greater with iopamidol and iohexol than with ioxaglate (p less than 0.05). The possible clinical consequences of the lack of sodium in contrast media preparations and of the changes in myocardial function are discussed in the light of the present results.
In the present study we investigated the effects of lipoic acid (LA) on delta-aminolevulinic dehydratase (delta-ALA-D) and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activities in rat brain after seizures induction by pilocarpine. Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group), lipoic acid (10mg/kg, i.p., LA group), pilocarpine (400mg/kg, i.p., pilocarpine group), or the combination of LA (10mg/kg, i.p.) with pilocarpine (400mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before administration of LA (LA plus pilocarpine group). After the treatments all groups were observed for 1h. The enzyme activities (delta-ALA-D and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase) were measured using spectrophotometric methods, and the results were compared with that obtained from saline and pilocarpine-treated animals. Neuroprotective effects of LA against seizures were evaluated based on those enzyme activities. The pilocarpine group showed a reduction in delta-ALA-D and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activities after seizures. In turn, LA plus pilocarpine abolished the appearance of seizures and reversed the decreased in delta-ALA-D and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activities produced by seizures, when compared to the pilocarpine seizing group. The results from the present study demonstrate that preadministration of LA abolished seizure episodes induced by pilocarpine in rat, probably by increasing delta-ALA-D and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activities in rat brain during seizures.
Various 5-aminobenzofuran derivatives were prepared from khellin and screened intravenously in the dog for their potential antiarrhythmic activity against ouabain-induced ventricular arrhythmia and in the Harris test. From systematic structural variations it was found that two methoxy groups in positions 4 and 7 on the benzofuran ring, a tertiary aminoethoxy side chain in position 6, and a N-methylurea group in position 5 led to the most active compounds. These were then tested orally in the Harris test in the dog. The two long-acting derivatives N-[4,7-dimethoxy-6-(2-pyrrolidinoethoxy)-5-benzofuranyl]-N'-methylurea (8j) and N-[4,7-dimethoxy-6-(2-piperidinoethoxy)-5-benzofuranyl]-N'-methylurea (8m) showed advantages when compared to quinidine and disopyramide and have been selected for further studies.
We review the effects of heterocyclic antidepressant compounds on the cardiovascular system. It has been shown that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) slow intraventricular conduction, and this can be seen on a standard ECG as the increased QRS, PR, and QTc intervals. This prolonged conduction is dangerous to patients in two conditions. In overdose, delayed conduction may lead to a complete heart block or ventricular reentry arrhythmias. Either of these complications, or a combination of both, may lead to death. When treated with TCAs at therapeutic plasma levels, depressed patients with preexisting conduction disease, particularly bundle-branch block, are at higher risk to develop symptomatic A-V block than depressed patients free of conduction disorders. Clinically, the effects of TCAs on conduction does not differ significantly within the family of drugs. Who gets complications is much more a function of severity of the patient's preexisting cardiac condition. The most common cardiovascular effect of TCAs is orthostatic hypotension. Postural hypotension is more dangerous in elderly patients because it may lead to falls that cause serious physical injuries. Severe orthostatic hypotension is more likely to develop in depressed patients with left ventricular impairment and/or in patients taking other drugs like diuretics or vasodilators. Nortriptyline has been shown to cause significantly less serious postural blood pressure drops, an important difference between this drug and other TCAs. Another cardiovascular effect of TCAs is that they reduce ventricular arrhythmias. They share this property with Type 1A antiarrhythmic compounds, and a variety of Type 1 antiarrhythmics have recently been shown to increase mortality in postmyocardial infarction patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The effects of cocaine were examined prior to and during bupropion maintenance in nonopioid-dependent cocaine abusers. Prior to bupropion maintenance, subjects underwent an experimental session during which repeated cocaine doses (0, 50, 100 mg/70 kg) were administered intranasally. Then subjects were maintained on bupropion (150 and 300 mg per day) and underwent experimental sessions as before. Cocaine, regardless of bupropion, produced dose-related increases in several stimulant-like self-reports, performance and cardiovascular measures. Bupropion decreased POMS ratings of friendliness and vigor, regardless of cocaine dose. Bupropion enhanced and attenuated cocaine-induced increases in ratings on the LSD and BG subscales of the ARCI, respectively. These results suggest that bupropion does not alter the acute subjective or cardiovascular effects of cocaine in a robust manner.
Smac, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases, promotes apoptosis via activation of caspases. Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) negatively regulates another mitochondrial protein, cytochrome c, during apoptosis; however, the role of Hsp27 in modulating Smac release is unknown. Here we show that Hsp27 is overexpressed in both dexamethasone (Dex)-resistant multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines (MM.1R, U266, RPMI-8226) and primary patient cells. Blocking Hsp27 by an antisense (AS) strategy restores the apoptotic response to Dex in Dex-resistant MM cells by triggering the release of mitochondrial protein Smac, followed by activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Moreover, AS-Hsp27 overcomes interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated protection against Dex-induced apoptosis. These data demonstrate that Hsp27 inhibits the release of Smac, and thereby confers Dex resistance in MM cells.
The effects of the oral administration of diazepam 5, 10 and 20 mg, flunitrazepam 0.5 and 1 mg and lorazepam 1, 2 and 4 mg on memory were studied in groups of healthy patients before surgery. The degree of sedation was noted also. A dose-related amnesic effect was produced by all the drugs, but this was not significant with diazepam 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg. Larger doses of diazepam (10 and 20 mg) produced brief amnesia comparable to equivalent doses of flunitrazepam (0.5 and 1 mg). There was the same delay in the onset of amnesia after oral lorazepam 4 mg as when it was given i.v. and its effect lasted for at least 90 min after administration. In contrast to the effect of the same drugs given i.v., drowsiness and failure of recognition follow a similar time course.
