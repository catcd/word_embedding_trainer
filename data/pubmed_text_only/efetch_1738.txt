Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists alleviate memory deficits caused by aging or by administration of beta-amyloid peptides in rodents, which is in accordance with the beneficial effects of caffeine consumption (an adenosine receptor antagonist) on memory performance in aged individuals and in preventing Alzheimer's disease. We now tested if A2A receptor blockade affords a general beneficial effect in different experimental paradigms disturbing memory performance in rodents. The beta-amyloid fragment present in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Abeta1-42, 2 nmol, icv) decreased spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze after 15 days (29%) to an extent similar to the decrease of memory performance caused by scopolamine (2 mg/kg, ip) or MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg, ip) after 30 min (28% and 39%, respectively). The selective A2A receptor antagonist SCH58261 (0.05 mg/kg, ip every 24 h, starting 30 min before the noxious stimuli) prevented Abeta1-42-induced amnesia, but failed to modify scopolamine- or MK-801-induced amnesia. Similar conclusions were reached when testing another A2A receptor antagonist (KW6002, 3 mg/kg, ip). These results indicate that A2A receptors do not affect general processes of memory impairment but instead play a crucial role restricted to neurodegenerative conditions involving an insidious synaptic deterioration leading to memory dysfunction.
Millions of individuals in Europe and the United States use cocaine regularly. Use of cocaine may have several orofacial effects such as perforation of nasal septum and palate, gingival lesions and erosion of tooth surfaces. Recent use of cocaine may also increase medical risks during dental treatment, especially when local anaesthetics with epinephrine or epinephrine-impregnated retraction cords are used. Therefore, it is recommended to postpone dental treatment at least 6 to 24 hours after the use of cocaine.
To determine the echocardiographic changes over time of valvular heart lesions in patients who took the weight loss drugs fenfluramine and phentermine.
This prospective cohort study began at the termination of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled weight loss trial of 18 obese women and 13 obese men (mean age, 42 years; mean body mass index, 33.4 kg/m2) who had been assigned randomly to treatment with fenfluramine and phentermine or to placebo. Echocardiograms were obtained at termination of the trial when fenfluramine was withdrawn from the market and 6 months later. They were interpreted independently by 3 cardiologists blinded to treatment assignment and temporal sequence of the echocardiograms. The main outcome measure was the change in drug-related valvular disease over time.
One subject assigned to receive the drugs was lost to follow-up, and 3 subjects who did not meet a weight loss goal of 10 kg crossed over from placebo to drug treatment. Echocardiograms were obtained in 19 subjects who received the drugs and 11 subjects who received placebo, and 6-month follow-up echocardiograms were obtained in 15 subjects who received the drugs and 3 who received placebo. Subjects had taken fenfluramine and phentermine a mean of 41 weeks (range, 8-73 weeks). Five of 19 subjects who received the drugs (26%; 95% confidence interval, 7%-46%) and 1 of 11 who received placebo (9%) (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-35.6) had findings that met criteria established for drug-related valvular disease. All 5 subjects (4 women and 1 man) receiving the drugs had mild aortic regurgitation, and 1 also had pulmonary hypertension (estimated pulmonary artery pressure, 59 mm Hg). Six months later, the echocardiographic findings had improved in all 5 subjects (P=.06), and 3 no longer met the criteria for drug-related valvular disease. Pulmonary artery pressures decreased to near normal in the subject with pulmonary hypertension (37 mm Hg). Overall, the echocardiographic valvular features improved in 8 of 15 subjects who received the drugs and had echocardiograms performed at both time periods (P=.008).
Valvular heart disease did not appear to progress after cessation of use of fenfluramine and phentermine, and echocardiographic valvular features appeared to improve over time.
Amiodarone resulted in a rapid ventricular response to atrial flutter in an infant with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
The present study examines the mechanism(s) of action of anethole trithione (Sulfarlem S25) compared to the sialogogue pilocarpine. The chronic effects (7 days of treatment) of anethole trithione, pilocarpine and/or amitriptyline on autonomic receptor binding (homogenates) were measured together with parallel tests of stimulation-induced rises in delta [Ca2+]i in collagenase-isolated rat parotid acini. The results revealed that chronic treatment with amitriptyline resulted in significantly increased rises in delta [Ca2+]i after stimulation with 20 microM of carbachol or adrenaline, and a significant increase in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor density. In addition, anethole trithione also increased cholinergic and adrenergic responsiveness. The double treatment of amitriptyline and anethole trithione or amitriptyline and pilocarpine did, however, prevent the rise in delta [Ca2+]i observed under conditions when these drugs were administered alone. Furthermore, anethole trithione, but not pilocarpine, was able to prevent the amitriptyline-induced upregulation in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor density. In conclusion, the experimental data presented in this study are compatible with the hypothesis that anethole trithione might stimulate some post-receptor effect in the coupling to the secretory response. In addition, this study supports the beneficial effects of anethole trithione in treating drug-induced xerostomia.
In the present study we have compared the tumor-promoting activity of the non-phorbol ester-type skin tumor promoter, mirex, a halogenated cycloalkane pesticide, to the following: (i) chlordane, a halogenated cycloalkane pesticide; (ii) 1,1-bis (4-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichlorethane (DDT), a halogenated bridged aromatic pesticide; and (iii) kepone, a halogenated cycloalkane pesticide, which only differs from mirex by the substitution of two chlorine atoms with an oxygen atom. Topical application of 200 nmol mirex three times weekly for 20 weeks to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated female mouse skin produced approximately 16 tumors/mouse with a 96% incidence of tumor bearing mice. Neither chlordane (2 mumol) or DDT (5 mumol) promoted tumors in DMBA-initiated mouse skin after three times weekly application for 20 weeks. Unexpectedly, DMBA-initiated mice treated with 250 nmol kepone three times weekly for 20 weeks did not develop any tumors, demonstrating that the replacement of two chlorine atoms by an oxygen atom results in loss of the skin tumor-promoting activity of mirex. To further characterize mirex-induced skin tumor promotion, male mice were initiated with a single topical application of 200 nmol DMBA and promoted topically three times weekly for 20 weeks with 200 nmol mirex. As compared to female mice, male mice demonstrated (i) 70% fewer tumors/mouse, (ii) decreased incidence of tumor bearing mice, (iii) increased time to first tumor and (iv) increased latency. To determine the role of ovarian hormones in the increased sensitivity of female mice, mice were initiated with DMBA, ovariectomized (OVX) 2 weeks later and then promoted with mirex. OVX mice exhibited 70% fewer tumors/mouse and a 40% decrease in incidence of tumor-bearing mice as compared to controls. Finally, > 90% of DMBA-initiated/mirex-promoted papillomas from male mice and female mice demonstrated a mutated Ha-ras gene with an A-->T transversion in the middle base of the 61st codon. Collectively, these data indicate that the tumor-promoting ability of mirex is highly structure specific, and ovarian hormones are a factor in the increased sensitivity of female mice to the skin tumor-promoting ability of mirex. Furthermore, mirex appears to clonally expand epidermal cells with a mutated Ha-ras oncogene.
Various chemical agents were examined for their radioprotective capability to provide partial protection against radiation injury over the past 50 years. However, no suitable drug has yet been introduced for routine clinical use. In the present study, the radioprotective potential of H2 receptor antagonists was examined in in vivo and in vitro conditions. For this purpose, an in vivo micronucleus assay and an in vitro metaphase analysis were used to test the effects of cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine on radiation-induced clastogenic effects. For micronuclei assay, BALB/c mice were irradiated in the presence or absence of drugs, and slides were prepared from bone marrow cells. The frequency of micronuclei was determined in bone marrow erythrocytes. For the in vitro assay, lymphocytes in whole peripheral blood were exposed to radiation in the presence or absence of drugs, and the frequency of chromosomal aberrations were determined. The results show that radiation produced a high number of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) and chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes. All three drugs used in this study effectively reduced the frequency of radiation-induced micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations at various doses. Famotidine was found to be more effective than the other two drugs. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that H2-receptor antagonists reduced the clastogenic effects of radiation with a dose reduction factor (DRF) of 1.5-2 in vivo and in vitro. The way in which these drugs reduce the clastogenic effects of radiation might be via a radical scavenging mechanism.
The blood pressure of 18 patients with refractory hypertension was controlled by treatment with Minoxidil in combination with Propranolol and diuretics. Ten of these patients were studied prospectively and were found not to have deterioration of carbohydrate tolerance while on Minoxidil therapy. Pericardial effusions occurred in 40% of the patients, including 2 with normal renal function. This untoward effect of prolonged use Minoxidil warrants further study.
Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) therapy for Onchocerca volvulus infection results in frequent ocular and systemic complications, but the pathogenesis of these complications is unclear. Twenty men with O. volvulus infection were treated over a period of six months with DEC given daily for one week and weekly thereafter. Major systemic and ocular complications included proteinuria, severe pruritus, visual field constriction, optic nerve pallor, chorioretinitis, anterior uveitis, and punctate keratitis. Levels of circulating immune complexes (CICs) were increased (greater than 11% [125I]C1q binding) in 14 of the 20 men prior to treatment. Persons with pretreatment C1q binding activity of greater than 30% were at increased risk to develop constriction of visual fields (P less than 0.05) and proteinuria (P less than 0.015). Linear regression analysis revealed a striking correlation between pretreatment levels of CICs and the total number of both systemic and ocular complications (P less than 0.001) and ocular complications alone (P less than 0.005). These results suggest that CICs may be important in the pathogenesis of the delayed systemic and ocular complications following DEC therapy for O. volvulus infection.
Seizures produced by pilocarpine given i.p. to rats provide an animal model for studying the initiation, spread and generalisation of convulsive activity within the forebrain. Pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg, produces a sequence of behavioural and electroencephalographic alterations indicative of motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus, which is followed by widespread damage to the limbic forebrain resembling that occurring subsequent to prolonged intractable seizures. Microinjections of a selective antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, (+/-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, into the substantia nigra pars reticulata, bilaterally, protects against the behavioural, electrographic and morphological features of seizures produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg, with an ED50 of 0.0007 mumol (0.0004-0.0011). Microinjections of (+/-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, 0.005 or 0.01 mumol, into the substantia nigra pars compacta or into the dorsal part of mid-anterior striatum do not modify the electrographic and morphological sequelae of pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. In rats pretreated with microinjections of N-methyl-D-aspartate into the substantia nigra pars reticulata, a non-convulsive dose of pilocarpine, 100 mg/kg, results in recurrent motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus. The ED50 of N-methyl-D-aspartate for the generation of seizures after pilocarpine, 100 mg/kg, is 0.0014 mumol (0.001-0.0019). Electrographic monitoring shows a pattern and sequence of evolution of convulsant activity within the hippocampus and cortex similar to that produced with pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg, alone. Morphological examination of brains from rats treated with N-methyl-D-aspartate in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and subsequently given pilocarpine, 100 mg/kg, which underwent status epilepticus, reveals widespread damage to the amygdala, thalamus, olfactory cortex, substantia nigra, neocortex, and hippocampus. Microinjections of N-methyl-D-aspartate, 0.002 mumol, into either the substantia nigra pars compacta or dorsal striatum, bilaterally, do not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine, 100 mg/kg. The results indicate that the threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats is modulated by excitatory amino acid neurotransmission within the substantia nigra pars reticulata.
Lithium-induced impairment of renal concentrating ability is regarded as a harmless side effect of lithium treatment. This report presents investigations of renal function and renal pathology in 13 patients with reduced renal concentrating ability arising during lithium treatment. The reduced concentrating ability parallels histological damage and is a sign of lithium-induced chronic nephropathy.
The continuous lifetime administration of 0.015% beta-phenylethylhydrazine sulfate in the drinking water of Swiss mice, beginning at 6 weeks of age, gave rise to tumors of the lungs and blood vessels. As compared to untreated controls, the incidence of lung tumors rose from 21 to 56% in females and from 23 to 36% in males, while the incidence of vascular tumors increased from 5 to 44% in females and from 6 to 8% in males. Statistically, the increased incidence of tumors of lungs and blood vessels in females appears to be significant. The treatment had no statistically significant effect on the development of tumors in males. Histopathological examination revealed the characteristic appearance of adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the lungs, and angioma and angiosarcoma of blood vessels. This study reports for the first time the tumorigenicity of beta-phenylethylhydrazine sulfate, which is currently used to treat mental depression.
The objective of this study was to understand the attitudes and preferences of risk-eligible women regarding use of tamoxifen for breast cancer risk reduction.
A cross-sectional, mixed-methods interview study was conducted at a university medical center and at community sites. Participants were women who had an estimated 5-year breast cancer risk > or = 1.7% and no prior breast cancer. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The interview included a 15-minute, standardized educational session on the potential benefits and harms of tamoxifen followed by close-ended and open-ended questions about participants' inclinations to take tamoxifen and factors important to their decision. A demographic questionnaire, a test on knowledge of potential benefits and harms of tamoxifen, and an interview evaluation were included.
Two hundred fifty-five women completed interviews. Their estimated mean 5-year breast cancer risk was 2.8%; and their mean self-perceived 5-year risk was 32.7%. After the educational intervention, 45 women (17.6%) were inclined to take tamoxifen. Very high risk women (> 3.5%) were no more inclined to take it than women with lower risk (1.7-3.5%). In a multivariable analysis, lower income, confidence in the effectiveness of tamoxifen, and concern about fractures were associated with being inclined to take it; concern about pulmonary embolism, dyspareunia, cataracts, and low self-perceived breast cancer risk were associated negatively with taking tamoxifen. Participants expressed concerns about adverse effects.
Less than 20% of women were interested in tamoxifen after education about potential benefits and harms, despite a very high self-perceived breast cancer risk. Candidate chemoprevention agents must have few potential adverse effects to achieve widespread acceptance.
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective long-term therapy for congestive heart failure, improving symptoms, exercise tolerance, biochemical anomalies, and mortality. Captopril, in doses of up to 150 mg daily is relatively free of serious adverse effects. A test dose of 6.25 mg normally precedes regular therapy in an attempt to avoid first-dose hypotension, which may also be prevented by reduction in diuretic dosage and by the avoidance of over-diuresis leading to volume depletion. We report two patients who, despite the above precautions developed symptomatic first-dose hypotension with 6.25 mg, but were subsequently able to recommence captopril therapy by the initial oral administration of doses as low as 1 mg.
Baroreceptor-mediated phasic changes in vagal tone have been hypothesized to cause ventriculophasic sinus arrhythmia (VPSA). The objectives of this study were to demonstrate ventriculophasic modulation of AV nodal conduction and to substantiate the role of the baroreflex on ventriculophasic AV nodal conduction (VPAVN) by pharmacological perturbation of parasympathetic tone.
Twelve patients with infra-Hisian second-degree heart block and VPSA were studied. Incremental atrial pacing was performed until AV nodal Wenckebach block at baseline, after phenylephrine infusion, and after atropine. AV nodal conduction curves were constructed for each phase and compared. At baseline, VPAVN was present in 9 of 12 patients on the steep portion of the AV nodal conduction curves. Phenylephrine increased systolic blood pressure from 149+/-33 to 177+/-22 mmHg (P<0.001) and sinus cycle length from 844+/-169 to 1010+/-190 ms (P<0.001) and shifted the AV nodal conduction curves up and to the right. Phenylephrine induced VPAVN in 2 of 3 patients in whom it was not present at baseline and in 11 of 12 total. Atropine abolished both VPSA and VPAVN in all patients.
VPAVN was demonstrated in patients with infra-Hisian second-degree AV block. It was accentuated by phenylephrine and abolished by atropine, suggesting a baroreflex mechanism for VPSA and VPAVN.
Chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy (PAN) is an experimental analog of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Progressive renal damage in this model is partly mediated by excessive production of oxidant species. Whether dietary supplementation with vitamin E, an endogenous lipophilic antioxidant, ameliorates the severity of chronic PAN was tested. PAN was induced by seven serial injections of the glomerular epithelial cell toxin puromycin aminonucleoside, 2 mg/100 g body wt per dose, over a 12-wk period. Experimental animals (N = 8) received vitamin E-enriched chow (100 IU/kg), whereas control PAN rats (N = 10) were fed standard rodent diet containing vitamin E (30 IU/kg of chow). The administration of vitamin E had no effect on somatic growth or blood pressure; however, rats with PAN fed the vitamin E-enriched diet had an increased hematocrit. In addition, the experimental diet resulted in a 50% reduction in urinary total protein and albumin excretion and stabilization of the serum albumin, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations (P < 0.01). The inulin clearance was 69% higher in the vitamin E-supplemented animals (P < 0.001). Tubular function, namely, phosphate reabsorption and beta 2-microglobulin excretion, was improved in rats with chronic PAN treated with the vitamin E-enriched diet. There was a significant decrease in glomerulosclerosis and glomerular planar area, and tubulointerstitial scarring was diminished in vitamin E-treated animals with chronic PAN (P < 0.01). These beneficial effects on renal structure and function were associated with reduced malondialdehyde content in the kidney and liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The authors have tried out a new way of administrating suxamethonium called self-taming dose, to sixty adult patients. A little dose of 10 mg is injected 30-60 seconds before the normal dose of 1-1.5 mg/kg. A real diminution of the frequence of muscule pain was found. This method was found of very simple use, in order to avoid post-operative muscle pain.
Experimental thyrotoxicosis in rats is accompanied by the increase of serum alanine aminotransferase (AlA), aspartate aminotransferase (AsA), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) activities and content of primary products of lipid peroxidation--conjugated dienes--in liver, heart and blood. This suggests impairments in these organs accompanying free radical processes intensification. Administration of melatonin decreased AlA, AsA and CK-MB activities and CD level decreased. Thyrotoxicosis increased catalase activity in liver, heart and blood. Exogenous melatonin decreased specific activity ofcatalase in blood and in heart in comparison with animals subjected to hyperthyroidism. However, some increase of catalase specific activity (approximately 15%) was observed in liver. alpha-Tocopherol content, raising in rat tissues in thyrotoxicosis development conditions, decreased after melatonin treatment. Thus, exogenous melatonin is capable to reduce lipid peroxidation intensity at thyrotoxicosis and to act as an adoptogen, regulating free radical homeostasis.
Benzotrichloride (BTC) is used extensively as a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of benzoyl chloride and benzoyl peroxide. Epidemiological data suggest that BTC is a human lung carcinogen. BTC is also a carcinogen in the A/J mouse lung tumor bioassay. Activated K-ras protooncogenes were detected in BTC-induced lung tumors from A/J mice. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify specific DNA segments likely to contain activating mutations, and the amplified DNAs were sequenced to identify the mutation. The activating mutation present in the K-ras gene from all BTC-induced lung tumors (24/24) was a GC-->AT transition in codon 12. Thus, BTC may exert its carcinogenic action by activation of the K-ras protooncogene through a genotoxic mechanism.
Central nociceptive processing includes spinal and supraspinal neurons, but the supraspinal mechanisms mediating changes in pain threshold remain unclear. We investigated the role of forebrain neurons in capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia. Long-Evans rat pups at 21 days were randomized to undisturbed control group, or to receive tactile stimulation, saline injection (0.9% w/v) or capsaicin injection (0.01% w/v) applied to each paw at hourly intervals. Thermal paw withdrawal latency was measured 1 h later, forebrains were removed and purified forebrain neuronal membranes were assayed for adenylyl cyclase activity and opioid receptor function. Capsaicin-injected rats had decreased thermal latency (P < 0.0001) compared to the other groups. Neuronal membranes showed increased basal (P = 0.0003) and forskolin-stimulated (P=0.0002) adenylyl cyclase activity in the capsaicin group compared to other groups. The selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) was less effective in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity in the capsaicin group (P < 0.001) compared to other groups. These effects were naloxone-reversible and pertussis toxin-sensitive (P < 0.01) in the control, tactile stimulation and saline injection groups but not in the capsaicin group. Binding capacity and affinity for micro-opioid receptors were similar in all four groups, suggesting that receptor downregulation was not involved. Exposure to DAMGO increased [35S]GTPgammaS binding to neuronal membranes from the control, tactile and saline groups (P<0.001) in a naloxone-reversible and pertussis toxin-sensitive manner (P < 0.01) but not in the capsaicin group, suggesting mu-opioid receptor desensitization. Dose responses to systemic morphine were also reduced in the capsaicin group compared to the tactile group (P < 0.05). Capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in 21-day-old rats was associated with an uncoupling of micro-opioid receptors in the forebrain. Opioid receptor desensitization in the forebrain may reduce opioidergic inputs to the descending inhibitory controls, associated with behavioral hyperalgesia and reduced responsiveness to morphine analgesia in capsaicin-injected young rats.
Fluoxetine (FLX) is a drug commonly used as antidepressant. However, its effects on tumorigenesis remain controversial. Aiming to evaluate the effects of FLX treatment on early malignant changes, we analyzed serotonin (5-HT) metabolism and recognition, aberrant crypt foci (ACF), proliferative process, microvessels, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in colon tissue. Male Wistar rats received a daily FLX-gavage (30mgkg(-1)) and, a single dose of 1,2 dimethylhydrazine (DMH; i.p., 125mgkg(-1)). After 6 weeks of FLX-treatment, our results revealed that FLX and nor-fluoxetine (N-FLX) are present in colon tissue, which was related to significant increase in serotonin (5-HT) levels (P<0.05) possibly through a blockade in SERT mRNA (serotonin reuptake transporter; P<0.05) resulting in lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels (P<0.01) and, 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expressions. FLX-treatment decreased dysplastic ACF development (P<0.01) and proliferative process (P<0.001) in epithelia. We observed a significant decrease in the development of malignant microvessels (P<0.05), VEGF (P<0.001), and COX-2 expression (P<0.01). These findings suggest that FLX may have oncostatic effects on carcinogenic colon tissue, probably due to its modulatory activity on 5-HT metabolism and/or its ability to reduce colonic malignant events.
Aristolochic acid I (AAI) and ochratoxin A (OTA) cause chronic kidney diseases. Recently, the contribution of hypoxic injuries and angiogenic disturbances to nephropathies has been suggested, but underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified yet. In porcine kidney epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1 cells, treatment with non-toxic doses of AAI increased whereas with OTA decreased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the angiogenic factor with well-defined functions in kidney. Moreover, the activity of transcription factors regulating VEGF expression was differentially affected by examined compounds. Activity of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) and SP-1 was increased by AAI but diminished by OTA. Interestingly, AP-1 activity was inhibited while NFκB was not influenced by both toxins. Mithramycin A, a SP-1 inhibitor, as well as chetomin, an inhibitor of HIFs, reversed AAI-induced up-regulation of VEGF synthesis, indicating the importance of SP-1 and HIFs in this effect. Additionally, adenoviral overexpression of HIF-2α but not HIF-1α prevented OTA-diminished VEGF production suggesting the protective effect of this isoform towards the consequences exerted by OTA. These observations provide new insight into complex impact of AAI and OTA on angiogenic gene regulation. Additionally, it adds to our understanding of hypoxia influence on nephropathies pathology.
Two cases of hypersensitivity reactions following etoposide infusion are reported, occurring in patients not previously exposed to the drug. In both cases, bronchospasm and diffuse skin flushing were the associated clinical findings. The present experience does not confirm the previous report by O'Dwyer and Weiss, who inferred the existence of two distinct clinical patterns in such patients, with either bronchospasm or flush. Type I hypersensitivity must be regarded as a possible acute adverse effect of etoposide infusion therapy, but more research seems necessary to elucidate the pathophysiology of this phenomenon.
Intrathecal (i.t.) injection of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to conscious mice produced a hyperalgesic action over a wide range of dosages with two apparent peaks at 100 pg and 10 ng per mouse, which may be mediated through EP3 and EP2 subtypes of the PGE receptor. In the present study, the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists on hyperalgesia induced by PGE2 were evaluated by the hot plate test at 30 min after i.t. injection. Hyperalgesia induced by a higher dose of PGE2 (10 ng/mouse) was relieved by D-AP5 (a competitive antagonist), 7-Cl-KynA (a glycine site antagonist), and ketamine and MK801 (non-competitive channel blockers). Intrathecal injection of butaprost (10 ng/mouse), an EP2 agonist, induced hyperalgesia, and this hyperalgesia was blocked by D-AP5, 7-Cl-KynA, ketamine, and MK801, similar to that induced by 10 ng of PGE2. On the other hand, hyperalgesia induced by a lower dose of PGE2 (100 pg/mouse) was blocked by D-AP5 and 7-Cl-KynA, but not by ketamine and MK801. Intrathecal injection of sulprostone (100 pg/mouse), an EP1 and EP3 agonist, induced hyperalgesia, and this hyperalgesia was blocked by D-AP5 and 7-Cl-KynA, but not by ketamine and MK801, similar to that induced by 100 pg of PGE2. These results first demonstrate that the NMDA receptor is involved in the PGE2-induced hyperalgesia and suggest that the hyperalgesic action by lower and higher doses of PGE2 may be mediated through EP3 and EP2 subtypes, respectively.
Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) accounts for 10% to 12% of epilepsy in children under 16 years of age. We screened for mutations in the GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) beta 3 subunit gene (GABRB3) in 48 probands and families with remitting CAE. We found that four out of 48 families (8%) had mutations in GABRB3. One heterozygous missense mutation (P11S) in exon 1a segregated with four CAE-affected persons in one multiplex, two-generation Mexican family. P11S was also found in a singleton from Mexico. Another heterozygous missense mutation (S15F) was present in a singleton from Honduras. An exon 2 heterozygous missense mutation (G32R) was present in two CAE-affected persons and two persons affected with EEG-recorded spike and/or sharp wave in a two-generation Honduran family. All mutations were absent in 630 controls. We studied functions and possible pathogenicity by expressing mutations in HeLa cells with the use of Western blots and an in vitro translation and translocation system. Expression levels did not differ from those of controls, but all mutations showed hyperglycosylation in the in vitro translation and translocation system with canine microsomes. Functional analysis of human GABA(A) receptors (alpha 1 beta 3-v2 gamma 2S, alpha 1 beta 3-v2[P11S]gamma 2S, alpha 1 beta 3-v2[S15F]gamma 2S, and alpha 1 beta 3-v2[G32R]gamma 2S) transiently expressed in HEK293T cells with the use of rapid agonist application showed that each amino acid transversion in the beta 3-v2 subunit (P11S, S15F, and G32R) reduced GABA-evoked current density from whole cells. Mutated beta 3 subunit protein could thus cause absence seizures through a gain in glycosylation of mutated exon 1a and exon 2, affecting maturation and trafficking of GABAR from endoplasmic reticulum to cell surface and resulting in reduced GABA-evoked currents.
Asthma morbidity and mortality have risen significantly in the last 10 years. The reasons for the increase are multifactorial. One proposed explanation is possible myocardial toxicity arising from the use of beta-agonists alone or in combination with methylxanthines. Previous studies have shown that beta-agonists given alone and beta-agonist/methylxanthine combinations given at higher than recommended clinical doses induced dose-related cardiotoxicity and sudden death in rats. The objective of the present study was to determine whether or not beta-agonists given alone and in combination with methylxanthines at recommended clinical doses also induce cardiotoxicity and sudden death in rats. The beta-agonists, isoproterenol hydrochloride (15 micrograms/kg), fenoterol hydrobromide (40 micrograms/kg), and terbutaline hemisulfate (0.4 mg/kg) were given in single sc doses separately and concurrently with the methylxanthines aminophylline hydrate (20 mg/kg) and caffeine (40 mg/kg), which were given up to a susceptible animal model, the heavy Sprague-Dawley rat. beta-agonist-induced myocardial toxicity (necrosis) was observed. The toxicity was enhanced by aminophylline resulting in the sudden death (most likely due to ventricular fibrillation) of some animals. A decrease in serum iron levels was observed in rats of all beta-agonist and/or methylxanthine-treated groups.
The ability of the natural selective delta opioid receptor agonist, [D-Ala2]deltorphin II (DADELT II), to inhibit the diarrhea induced by castor oil and colonic glass bead expulsion, was studied in rats after supraspinal and spinal administration. When injected intracerebroventricularly, DADELT II (0.2, 1, 10 micrograms/rat) inhibited diarrhea and colonic bead expulsion in a dose-related fashion but did not affect the rate of small intestine transit. Similar results were obtained when the same dose of DADELT II was administered spinally. The antidiarrheal and colonic antipropulsive effects of supraspinally and spinally DADELT II were partially or completely antagonized by subcutaneous pretreatment with 1 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, of naltrindole, a selective delta opioid receptor antagonist. These findings indicate that, in the rat, supraspinal and spinal delta opioid receptors play a role in modulating diarrhea and colonic propulsion and that DADELT II is a useful tool for investigating the role of the delta opioid system in gastrointestinal function.
