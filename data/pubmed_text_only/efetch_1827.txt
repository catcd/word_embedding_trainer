To examine the psychiatric status of young cocaine users using a validated instrument for the evaluation of psychiatric comorbidity, emphasizing the distinction between independent and induced psychiatric conditions.
Cross-sectional study.
Barcelona, Spain.
A cohort of 139 young (18-30 years) adult current regular cocaine users.
The Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM-IV, which produces diagnoses according to DSM-IV criteria, including Axis II antisocial and borderline personality disorders).
Nearly 42.5% of the subjects presented psychiatric comorbidity. The most common Axis I diagnoses were mood disorders (26.6%) and anxiety disorders (13%). Increasing age, having ever received treatment for drug use and freebase cocaine use were associated with substance-induced disorders diagnoses relative to primary Axis I disorders.
This study has shown a relatively high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in cocaine users recruited in non-clinical settings. Future studies examining potential differential factors associated with primary versus substance-induced disorders are necessary to optimize the implementation of more suitable approaching programmes for young regular cocaine users.
The intravascular injection of a large dose of bupivacaine induces electrophysiological cardiac impairment, mainly by slowing ventricular conduction velocity, and haemodynamic depression, by a decrease in myocardial contractility. When cardiotoxicity occurs, succinylcholine rapidly stops convulsions. However, the possible interactions between bupivacaine and succinylcholine on cardiac electrophysiology and haemodynamic status have never been investigated. Thus, we used an experimental electrophysiological model involving closed-chest dogs. Three groups (n = 6) of pentobarbital-anaesthetized dogs were given 0.2 mg.kg-1 atropine iv. Dogs in Group 1 were given saline. The others received 4 mg.kg-1 bupivacaine iv over ten seconds. Dogs in Group 2 were then given saline and those in Group 3 were then given 2 mg.kg-1 succinylcholine iv from one to two minutes after the administration of bupivacaine. The following electrophysiological variables were measured: heart rate represented by RR interval (RR), PR, atria-His (AH), and His-ventricle (HV) intervals, QRS duration, and QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc). The following haemodynamic variables were measured: mean aortic pressure (MAoP), the peak of the first derivative of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max), and LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Comparison between Groups 1 and 2 showed that bupivacaine induced more than 100% HV interval lengthening and QRS widening (P less than 0.01), prolonged QTc interval by more than 25% (P less than 0.01), and decreased LV dP/dt max by more than 50% (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The aim of this short communication is to discuss the mechanism, modality and treatment of ifosfamide encephalopathy. We present the case of a 52-year-old woman treated with this alkylating agent who developed severe neurotoxicity. It was resolved with administration of Methylene blue, abundant intravenous hydration and interruption of ifosfamide.
Recent genetic studies have implicated a number of candidate genes in the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Polymorphisms of CNTNAP2 (contactin-associated like protein-2), a member of the neurexin family, have already been implicated as a susceptibility gene for autism by at least 3 separate studies. We investigated variation in white and grey matter morphology using structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging. We compared volumetric differences in white and grey matter and fractional anisotropy values in control subjects characterised by genotype at rs7794745, a single nucleotide polymorphism in CNTNAP2. Homozygotes for the risk allele showed significant reductions in grey and white matter volume and fractional anisotropy in several regions that have already been implicated in ASD, including the cerebellum, fusiform gyrus, occipital and frontal cortices. Male homozygotes for the risk alleles showed greater reductions in grey matter in the right frontal pole and in FA in the right rostral fronto-occipital fasciculus compared to their female counterparts who showed greater reductions in FA of the anterior thalamic radiation. Thus a risk allele for autism results in significant cerebral morphological variation, despite the absence of overt symptoms or behavioural abnormalities. The results are consistent with accumulating evidence of CNTNAP2's function in neuronal development. The finding suggests the possibility that the heterogeneous manifestations of ASD can be aetiologically characterised into distinct subtypes through genetic-morphological analysis.
GH induces lipolysis in vivo, increasing plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels; in turn, FFA are able to reduce GH release, and acipimox, a nicotinic acid analog able to block lipolysis, enhances in normal subjects the GH response to GHRH. Obesity and old age are characterized by a blunted GH response to several stimuli, including GHRH; reports also indicate high plasma FFA levels in obesity and sometimes in the elderly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of FFA in GH release in obese and elderly subjects. According to a randomized, single blind, cross-over protocol, six healthy subjects, six obese subjects, and six elderly subjects received on 2 different days, with a 1-week interval, placebo or acipimox (250 mg, orally) at 0700 and 1100 h; GHRH [GHRH-(1-44)NH2; 50 micrograms in healthy subjects and in elderly subjects, 100 micrograms in obese subjects] was injected iv at 1300 h, and blood samples for evaluation of plasma FFA, blood glucose, serum insulin (IRI), and serum GH levels were taken from 1200 to 1500 h. Plasma FFA levels were always lower (P < 0.05) after acipimox than after placebo (0.03 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.02 g/L in healthy subjects, 0.09 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.02 g/L in obese, 0.02 +/- 0.005 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.01 g/L in elderly subjects); serum IRI levels were also lower (P < 0.05) after acipimox than after placebo in the three groups of subjects (16 +/- 3 vs. 30 +/- 5, 120 +/- 30 vs. 181 +/- 32, and 21 +/- 3 vs. 49 +/- 9 pmol/L); both FFA (P < 0.05) and IRI levels (P < 0.05) were higher in obese than in healthy or elderly subjects after placebo and acipimox. Blood glucose levels were not different in the three groups of subjects after either placebo or acipimox. The integrated GH response to GHRH-(GH delta area) was always greater (P < 0.05) after acipimox than after placebo (4677 +/- 633 vs. 1599 +/- 373 in healthy, 1469 +/- 230 vs. 343 +/- 114 in obese, 2304 +/- 759 vs. 325 +/- 133 micrograms/L.120 min in elderly subjects); after both placebo and acipimox, the GH delta area was greater (P < 0.05) in healthy subjects than in obese or elderly subjects. The GH delta area of elderly and obese subjects after acipimox was not different from the GH delta area of healthy subjects after placebo. Changes in GH delta areas were not significantly related to changes in FFA or IRI induced by acipimox; in contrast, absolute values of FFA and IRI as well as basal GH levels were all significantly related to the GH delta area. At multiple regression analysis, FFA was the only significant predictor of GH delta area. These data indicate that acute pharmacological reduction of plasma FFA levels restores the blunted GH response to GHRH commonly observed in obese and elderly subjects: however, when lipolysis is blocked to a similar extent, healthy subjects still show a higher GH delta area than obese or elderly subjects. As FFA are the best predictor of the GH delta area, we suggest that in obesity, the blunted GH release is due to high FFA levels, whereas in the elderly there might be an abnormal sensitivity to normal FFA levels.
Three cases of acute myocardial infarction due to cocaine-related coronary artery disease are presented. Pathogenesis and autopsy findings are discussed.
Acetazolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes hydration/dehydration of carbon dioxide, has been used for correction of metabolic alkalosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Animal experiments have shown that the gradient between tissue and the alveolar CO2 tension increases after inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, suggesting retention of CO2. In order to determine the true degree of carbon dioxide retention after total inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, 10 patients with COPD and pronounced metabolic alkalosis (base excess above 6) under controlled mechanical ventilation were studied. The study showed that there was a statistically significant increase in tissue PCO2 and a temporary decrease in pulmonary carbon dioxide excretion. Furthermore, it was found that PaO2 and PVO2 increased significantly after inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, which could, at least partly, explain the improvement seen in patients with COPD and metabolic alkalosis after treatment with acetazolamide.
To estimate a suspected causal association between cocaine use and the occurrence of panic.
Data are from an epidemiologic sample of school-attending youths enrolled in primary school who were traced, rerecruited, and assessed via standardized interviews in young adulthood during 2000-2002. A total of 1,692 young adults comprised the analysis sample. Occurrences of panic and cocaine use were assessed in young adulthood, via standardized item sets from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. A brief assessment of panic experiences had also been made when the youths were in early adolescence.
With statistical adjustment for important covariates, we found a modestly excess occurrence of panic attack-like experiences among those who had used cocaine at least once, relative to occurrence among young people who never had used cocaine (estimated odds ratio, OR = 1.9; p = .014 before exclusion of 288 with early onset panic attack-like experiences; p = .005 after this exclusion).
The main finding of this study was an association linking cocaine use and panic attack-like experiences, which was more modest than was observed in study samples that included older adults.
Zinc deficiency is implicated in the pathogenesis of human esophageal cancer. In the rat esophagus, it induces cell proliferation, modulates genetic expression, and enhances carcinogenesis. Zinc-replenishment reverses proliferation and inhibits carcinogenesis. The zinc-deficient rat model allows the identification of biological differences affected by zinc during early esophageal carcinogenesis.
We evaluated gene expression profiles of esophageal epithelia from zinc-deficient and replenished rats vs zinc-sufficient rats using microarray analysis. We characterized the role of the top-up-regulated gene S100A8 in esophageal hyperplasia/reversal and in chemically induced esophageal carcinogenesis in zinc-modulated animals by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
The hyperplastic-deficient esophagus has a distinct expression signature with the proinflammation genes S100 calcium binding protein A8 (S100A8) and A9 (S100A9) up-regulated 57-fold and 5-fold, respectively. Zinc replenishment rapidly restored to control levels the expression of S100A8/A9 and 27 other genes and reversed the hyperplastic phenotype. With its receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), colocalization and overexpression of S100A8 protein occurred in the deficient esophagus that overexpressed nuclear factor kappaBeta p65 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein. Zinc replenishment, but not a COX-2 inhibitor, reduced the overexpression of these 4 proteins. Additionally, esophageal S100A8/A9 messenger RNA levels were associated directly with the diverse tumorigenic outcome in zinc-deficient and zinc-replenished rats.
In vivo zinc regulates S100A8 expression and modulates the link between S100A8-RAGE interaction and downstream nuclear factor kappaBeta/COX-2 signaling. The finding that zinc regulates an inflammatory pathway in esophageal carcinogenesis may lead to prevention and therapy for this cancer.
Extensive hypermethylation and consecutive transcriptional silencing of tumorsuppressor genes have been documented in multiple tumor entities including breast cancer. In a microarray based genome-wide methylation analysis of five sporadic breast carcinomas we identified a hypermethylated CpG island within the first intron of the prospero related homeobox gene 1 (PROX1). We, therefore, investigated CpG island methylation of PROX1 in a series of 33 pairs of primary breast cancer and corresponding normal tissue samples by bisulfite sequencing and COBRA analyses. Seventeen of these (52%) breast cancer samples revealed a significant accumulation of methylated CpG sites along with a significant reduction of PROX1 transcription compared to normal breast tissues of the same patients. Frequent methylation was also observed in brain metastases from primary breast cancer (21/37 = 57% of cases). Secondary, we analysed 38 brain metastases of primary breast carcinomas and detected a significantly reduced expression of PROX1 compared to normal breast tissue (p < 0.001) and primary breast carcinomas (p < 0.05), respectively. Additionally, treatment of breast cancer cell lines with demethylating agents could reactivate PROX1 transcription. In summary, we have identified PROX1 as a novel target gene that is hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced in primary and metastatic breast cancer.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in angiogenesis, wound healing and inflammation. VEGF exerts its effect via the tyrosine kinase receptors Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1. We have previously shown that VEGF is up-regulated in a chronic cyclosporine (CsA) nephrotoxicity model. Our current study examined the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) blockade with enalapril (E) or losartan (L) on VEGF in this model.
Pair-fed salt-depleted rats were administered vehicle, CsA, CsA + nilvadipine, CsA + hydralazine/hydrochlorthiazide (HCTZ), CsA + E or CsA + L, and were sacrificed at 7 or 28 days. Physiologic and histologic changes were studied in addition to the mRNA expression of VEGF and its receptors Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1 by Northern blot, and the protein expression of VEGF by Western blot.
While all groups achieved similar blood pressures and creatinine clearances, the amelioration in nephrotoxicity was observed only with Ang II blockade. VEGF mRNA and protein expressions increased with CsA and became significantly reduced with Ang II blockade. Flt-1 expression was similar in all groups; it decreased early and remained low. On the other hand, KDR/Flk-1 mRNA expression was higher at seven days in all groups, except in the +E and +L groups where it was significantly lower, and then became further down-regulated at 28 days.
The increased VEGF expression in chronic CsA nephrotoxicity seems to be related to up-regulation of Ang II. In addition, VEGF probably exerted its effect via the KDR/Flk-1 receptor. The actions of VEGF in this model remain speculative, but may be related to its effect on macrophage infiltration or matrix deposition.
We report two infants with near miss sudden infant death syndrome events exhibiting seizure disorders after caffeine treatment, suggesting there is an infant subgroup diagnosed as near miss sudden infant death syndrome who have apnoea possibly with seizures whose seizure threshold may be lowered by central nervous system stimulants like caffeine.
The effects of the opioid-type stressor, immobilization, on severity of ouabain-induced cardiac arrhythmias and the possible involvement of serum catecholamines were investigated in rats. Immobilization significantly reduced the number of ventricular premature beats and the incidence of ventricular tachycardia episodes. The arterial serum catecholamine levels (A, NA and DA), measured immediately after the stressor application, were increased significantly and were in negative correlation with the arrhythmia parameters. Both changes were reversed by naloxone (5 mg/kg) treatment after application of immobilization. The effects observed in this study may be attributed to the actions of endogenous opioid peptides released during stress.
Astemizole is a new, long-acting H1 receptor antagonist that has proven effective in controlling the signs and symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria, without the sedative and anticholinergic side effects that typify use of many antihistamines. In an eight-week open study of 20 patients, astemizole significantly decreased the signs and symptoms of urticaria, as well as the severity of urticaria by anatomic location. Five patients reported complete clearing. Modest weight gain while on chronic therapy appears to be a significant side effect.
Previous studies of DDT and breast cancer assessed exposure later in life when the breast may not have been vulnerable, after most DDT had been eliminated, and after DDT had been banned.
We investigated whether DDT exposure in young women during the period of peak DDT use predicts breast cancer.
We conducted a prospective, nested case-control study with a median time to diagnosis of 17 years using blood samples obtained from young women during 1959-1967. Subjects were members of the Child Health and Development Studies, Oakland, California, who provided blood samples 1-3 days after giving birth (mean age, 26 years). Cases (n = 129) developed breast cancer before the age of 50 years. Controls (n = 129) were matched to cases on birth year. Serum was assayed for p,p'-DDT, the active ingredient of DDT; o,p'-DDT, a low concentration contaminant; and p,p'-DDE, the most abundant p,p'-DDT metabolite.
High levels of serum p,p'-DDT predicted a statistically significant 5-fold increased risk of breast cancer among women who were born after 1931. These women were under 14 years of age in 1945, when DDT came into widespread use, and mostly under 20 years as DDT use peaked. Women who were not exposed to p,p'-DDT before 14 years of age showed no association between p,p'-DDT and breast cancer (p = 0.02 for difference by age).
Exposure to p,p'-DDT early in life may increase breast cancer risk. Many U.S. women heavily exposed to DDT in childhood have not yet reached 50 years of age. The public health significance of DDT exposure in early life may be large.
Family members of asbestos workers are at increased risk of malignant mesothelioma (MM). Although the hazard is established, the magnitude of the risk is uncertain, and it is unclear whether risk is also increased for other cancers. Few cohort studies have been reported.
The "Eternit" factory of Casale Monferrato (Italy), active from 1907 to 1986, was among the most important Italian plants producing asbestos-cement (AC) goods. In this article we present updated results on mortality and MM incidence in the wives of workers at the factory.
We studied a cohort of 1,780 women, each married to an AC worker during his employment at the factory but not personally occupationally exposed to asbestos. Cohort membership was defined starting from the marital status of each worker, which was ascertained in 1988 from the Registrar's Office in the town where workers lived. At the end of follow-up (April 2003), 67% of women were alive, 32.3% dead, and 0.7% lost to follow-up. Duration of exposure was computed from the husband's period of employment. Latency was the interval from first exposure to the end of follow-up.
The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for pleural cancer [21 observed vs. 1.2 expected; SMR = 18.00; 95% confidence interval (CI), 11.14-27.52] was significantly increased. Mortality for lung cancer was not increased (12 observed vs. 10.3 expected; SMR = 1.17; 95% CI, 0.60-2.04). Eleven incident cases of pleural MM were observed (standardized incidence ratio = 25.19; 95% CI, 12.57-45.07).
Household exposure, as experienced by these AC workers' wives, increases risk for pleural MM but not for lung cancer.
Elevated circulating levels of an endogenous ouabain (EO) have been associated with essential hypertension. To investigate structure-activity relationships relevant to blood pressure, we infused either ouabain, ouabagenin, digoxin or digitoxin at 30 microg/kg/day in normal Sprague Dawley rats. After five weeks, the ouabain and ouabagenin infused rats were hypertensive, whereas blood pressures declined below their vehicle controls in rats infused with digoxin or digitoxin. In a second study, mean blood pressures were 118.5+/-1.7 mmHg in rats infused with ouabain (15 microg/kg/day) on day 35 vs. 98.3+/-1.8 and 100.3+/-1.1 mmHg in the digoxin (30 microg/kg/day) and vehicle infused groups (both p<0.005 vs. ouabain), respectively. Plasma and kidney levels of ouabain immunoreactivity were increased 4-8 fold in ouabain infused rats while blood pressure and plasma levels of ouabain returned to normal one week following discontinuation of the steroid infusion. In rats with ouabain-dependent hypertension, secondary infusions of digoxin or digitoxin (30 microg/kg/day) normalized blood pressure even though circulating ouabain remained elevated. In digoxin infused rats, neither blood pressure nor kidney digoxin immunoreactivity was raised whereas plasma digoxin was increased. Collectively, the results show that the hemodynamic effects of these sodium pump inhibitors differ dramatically during prolonged administration and that tissue rather than circulating levels of these agents appear to better explain their effects on blood pressure. These studies suggest that sodium pump inhibition is not the exclusive mediator of the hemodynamic effects of these cardiac glycosides and demonstrate the presence of structure-specific mechanisms that regulate their tissue levels and effects on long-term blood pressure.
Epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease risk factors and appropriate biomarkers in populations exposed to a wide range of arsenic levels are a public health research priority.
We investigated the relationship between inorganic arsenic exposure from drinking water and plasma levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), both markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation, in an arsenic-exposed population in Araihazar, Bangladesh.
The study participants included 115 individuals with arsenic-related skin lesions participating in a 2 x 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of vitamin E and selenium supplementation. Arsenic exposure status and plasma levels of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were assessed at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up.
Baseline well arsenic, a long-term measure of arsenic exposure, was positively associated with baseline levels of both sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 and with changes in the two markers over time. At baseline, for every 1-mug/L increase in well arsenic there was an increase of 0.10 ng/mL [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.00-0.20] and 0.33 ng/mL (95% CI, 0.15-0.51) in plasma sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, respectively. Every 1-microg/L increase in well arsenic was associated with a rise of 0.11 ng/mL (95% CI, 0.01-0.22) and 0.17 ng/mL (95% CI, 0.00-0.35) in sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 from baseline to follow-up, respectively, in spite of recent changes in urinary arsenic as well as vitamin E and selenium supplementation during the study period.
The findings indicate an effect of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water on vascular inflammation that persists over time and also suggest a potential mechanism underlying the association between arsenic exposure and cardiovascular disease.
To investigate vascular mechanisms in hypertension, we isolated renal arterial rings from rats with ouabain-dependent hypertension and studied their function. In rats infused with ouabain for 5 weeks, systolic and mean blood pressures (BP) were increased relative to controls. Contractions evoked by high KCl solutions were greater in rings from ouabain-infused rats whereas the threshold concentrations and EC50s for KCl and the peak caffeine contractures were not different. KCl contractures were not affected by 5 microM prazosin. Phenylephrine contractures were increased marginally in ouabain-infused rats, while acetylcholine-induced relaxation was normal. In vitro superfusion of rings with 10 nM ouabain or digoxin did not affect the measured parameters. Plasma ouabain, BP, and all evoked responses were normal one week following interruption of the ouabain infusion. In a second study, BP increased in ouabain (15 microg/kg/day, n= 23), but not digoxin (30 microg/kg/day, n=12), or vehicle-infused (n=16) rats. KCl contractures were greater in rings from ouabain-but decreased in rings from digoxin-infused rats, respectively and correlated with systolic and mean BP (r=0.69, n=30, p<0.005). Peak caffeine (25 mM) responses were similar but the area under the contraction was reduced in the vessels from ouabain-infused rats and correlated inversely with MBP (r=-0.47, n=33, p<0.02). We conclude that a voltage-dependent component of tone in the rat renal artery is reversibly and specifically augmented by in vivo administration of ouabain whereas it is diminished by in vivo digoxin. Vascular production of and response to nitric oxide does not appear to be impaired in the ouabain model. Alterations of intracellular Ca2+ storage and Ca2+ influx in response to in vivo ouabain may underlie the increase in renal vascular resistance and hypertension in this model. The opposite effects of ouabain and digoxin on the hemodynamic and vascular parameters in this study indicate that these agents have novel mechanisms of action in vivo that may not be mediated exclusively by sodium-potassium pumps.
To identify methylation-silenced genes in prostate cancers, a microarray analysis for genes up-regulated by treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, was performed using three rat prostate cancer cell lines. Eight genes (Aebp1, Dysf, Gas6, LOC361288, Nnat, Ocm, RGD1308119, and Tgfbr2) were re-expressed at 16-fold or more, and their promoter CpG islands were shown to be densely methylated in the cancer cell lines. From the eight genes, Tgfbr2, a key mediator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling that has been strongly implicated in human and rat prostate carcinogenesis, was selected, and its silencing in primary samples was analyzed further. Tgfbr2 was methylated and markedly down-regulated in three of seven 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl-induced invasive adenocarcinomas in the dorsolateral lobe of the rat prostate. In humans, marked down-regulation of TGFBR2 protein was observed in 12 of 20 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 36 of 60 prostate cancers. DNA methylation of the human TGFBR2 promoter CpG islands repressed transcription, if present, but neither methylation nor mutation were detected in 27 human prostate cancers analyzed. Methylation silencing of rat Tgfbr2 was associated with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation, whereas decreased expression of human TGFBR2 was mainly due to decreased transcription activity, sometimes in concert with histone deacetylation and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. The identification of methylation silencing of Tgfbr2 in rat prostate cancers, in accordance with TGFBR2 down-regulation in human prostate cancers, will enable us to analyze how aberrant methylation is induced in vivo and identify factors that promote and suppress the induction of aberrant methylation.
Airborne emissions from numerous point, area, and mobile sources, along with stagnant meteorologic conditions, contribute to frequent episodes of elevated air pollution in Houston, Texas. To address this problem, decision makers must set priorities among thousands of individual air pollutants as they formulate effective and efficient mitigation strategies.
Our aim was to compare and rank relative health risks of 179 air pollutants in Houston using an evidence-based approach supplemented by the expert judgment of a panel of academic scientists.
Annual-average ambient concentrations by census tract were estimated from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National-scale Air Toxics Assessment and augmented with measured levels from the Houston monitoring network. Each substance was assigned to one of five risk categories (definite, probable, possible, unlikely, uncertain) based on how measured or monitored concentrations translated into comparative risk estimates. We used established unit risk estimates for carcinogens and/or chronic reference values for noncarcinogens to set thresholds for each category. Assignment to an initial risk category was adjusted, as necessary, based on expert judgment about the quality and quantity of information available.
Of the 179 substances examined, 12 (6.7%) were deemed definite risks, 9 (5.0%) probable risks, 24 (13.4%) possible risks, 16 (8.9%) unlikely risks, and 118 (65.9%) uncertain risks.
Risk-based priority setting is an important step in the development of cost-effective solutions to Houston's air pollution problem.
Individuals deficient in erythrocytic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) show about a 2-fold increase in sensitivity toward dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia. Rat studies have shown that the hemolytic activity of dapsone resides in its N-hydroxy metabolites; exposure of rat red cells to N-hydroxy-dapsone in vitro followed by readministration to isologous rats results in premature splenic sequestration of the damaged cells. This study examines the ability of the steroid, epiandrosterone, to inhibit rat red cell G6PD and the effect of such inhibition on the susceptibility of rat red cells to N-hydroxydapsone hemolytic activity. Epiandrosterone was found to inhibit rat red cell G6PD uncompetitively and to suppress red cell hexose monophosphate shunt activity by more than 95%. Epiandrosterone suppression of rat red cell G6PD activity resulted in about a 2-fold increase in sensitivity of the rat cells to N-hydroxydapsone hemolytic activity, and a modest but significant increase in depletion of red cell glutathione. In contrast, suppression of rat red cell catalase activity by aminotriazole had no effect on the hemotoxicity of N-hydroxydapsone. Epiandrosterone appears to be a useful tool to explore the mechanism by which G6PD deficiency enhances susceptibility to hemolytic drugs.
Petrosaspongiolide M (PT) is a potent secretory phospholipase A(2) inhibitor and anti-inflammatory agent. This marine metabolite reduced the production of nitrite, prostaglandin E(2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the mouse air pouch injected with zymosan. These effects were also observed in mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated with zymosan. Inhibition of these inflammatory mediators was related to reductions in inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclo-oxygenase-2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression. Since nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) appears to play a central role in the transcriptional regulation of these proteins by macrophages, we investigated the effects of PT on this transcription factor. We found that PT was a potent inhibitor of the NF-kappaB pathway since at 1 microM it strongly decreased NF-kappaB-DNA binding in response to zymosan, in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Our study also indicated that PT could interfere with a key step in NF-kappaB activation, the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, resulting in inhibition of IkappaBalpha degradation. The control of a wide range of mediators by PT suggests a potentially wide therapeutic spectrum for this marine metabolite in inflammatory conditions.
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition scintirenography was performed to help establish the diagnosis and plan treatment of renovascular hypertension (RVH) in 57 hypertensive pediatric patients, 33 infants and 24 children older than 1 year. In 16 of 33 hypertensive infants, ACE inhibition scintirenography established the diagnosis of RVH from renal ischemia (due to aortic or renal arterial thrombi). Two scintigraphic criteria were used for the diagnosis of RVH: criterion I, ischemic and damaged kidney (a non-functioning kidney on or off ACE inhibition) and criterion II, ischemic but not damaged kidney (ACE inhibition induced deterioration of function of the kidney). When criterion I was present and the contralateral kidney was normal, ACE inhibitors could be used for treatment of hypertension without deterioration of renal function; kidneys satisfying criterion I eventually involuted or manifested growth arrest and frequently caused persistent RVH, even after resolution of the thrombus, requiring nephrectomy. When criterion II was present bilaterally, or it was associated with criterion I contralaterally, the use of antihypertensive drugs other than ACE inhibitors was necessary in order to prevent renal insufficiency or failure from ACE inhibitors. However, kidneys with criterion II showed normal growth and, following retraction or dissolution of the aortic thrombus, hypertension resolved. In 2 of 24 hypertensive children older than 1 year, the test was diagnostic of branch renal artery stenosis; RVH was cured by selective angioplasty. ACE inhibition scintirenography is useful in the evaluation and planning of treatment in children with hypertension and may predict the outcome of therapy and ultimate renal function.
Species and sex differences in susceptibility to vincristine sulphate (VCR)-induced olfactory epithelial lesions were investigated among the BALB/c mice, Crj: CD(SD) IGS rats and common marmoset monkeys following a single intravenous administration on day 1. As dosage levels, the 0.17-fold LD10, 0.6-fold LD10 and LD10 were used for mice and rats, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was chosen only for monkeys. The order of strength of VCR action on peripheral neuropathic signs, body weight gain, and hematological parameters was mice > rats > monkeys, without clear sex differences. Histopathologically, on day 2, single cell death in the olfactory epithelium and vomeronasal organ was observed only in male mice at LD10, and in female mice at 0.6-fold LD10 or more. On day 5, the olfactory epithelium in these mice showed regenerative proliferation suggesting a sign of recovery. On day 10, axonopathy and demyelination in the sciatic and trigeminal nerves were noted in mice of both sexes at 0.6-fold LD10 or more. In rats and monkeys of either sex, however, no morphological changes were observed at any dose level. In conclusion, mice, particularly females, were shown to be more susceptible to VCR-induced apoptosis in the olfactory epithelium than rats and monkeys.
Glycogen, which serves as a major energy reserve in cells, is a large, branched polymer of glucose molecules. We describe a patient who had muscle weakness, associated with the depletion of glycogen in skeletal muscle, and cardiac arrhythmia, associated with the accumulation of abnormal storage material in the heart. The skeletal muscle showed a marked predominance of slow-twitch, oxidative muscle fibers and mitochondrial proliferation. Western blotting showed the presence of unglucosylated glycogenin-1 in the muscle and heart. Sequencing of the glycogenin-1 gene, GYG1, revealed a nonsense mutation in one allele and a missense mutation, Thr83Met, in the other. The missense mutation resulted in inactivation of the autoglucosylation of glycogenin-1 that is necessary for the priming of glycogen synthesis in muscle.
The effects of escitalopram 10 to 20 mg/day and mirtazapine 30 to 45 mg/day on actual driving and psychomotor performance of 18 healthy subjects were determined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, 3-way crossover trial.
Each treatment period lasted for 15 days and was separated from the next period by a washout period of at least 13 days. Subjects received an evening dose of escitalopram 10 mg, mirtazapine 30 mg, or placebo from days 1 to 7 and an evening dose of escitalopram 20 mg, mirtazapine 45 mg, or placebo from days 8 to 15. On days 2, 9, and 16, reflecting acute period, dose increase, and steady state, respectively, the Road Tracking Test was performed. The main parameter was standard deviation of lateral position. Psychomotor performance was also assessed on days 2, 9, and 16 by laboratory computer tasks. Subjective sleep quality was measured with the Groninger Sleep Quality Scale, and mood was measured by visual analogue scales.
Treatment differences were apparent during the acute treatment period, in which subjects treated with mirtazapine 30 mg performed less well on the driving test as compared to placebo. The Divided Attention Task results also revealed a significant increase in tracking error after a single dose of mirtazapine 30 mg as compared to placebo. Mirtazapine decreased feelings of alertness and contentedness. Mirtazapine did not affect performance on days 9 and 16 of treatment. Escitalopram did not affect driving, psychomotor performance, or subjective mood throughout treatment.
Driving performance, as well as psychomotor functioning, was not affected by escitalopram treatment in healthy subjects. Driving performance was significantly impaired after ingestion of mirtazapine 30 mg during the acute treatment period.
