A 77-year-old male who had suffered from an upper respiratory infection and had been given Norfloxacin (NFLX) on May 2, 1990, developed generalized erythema which did not subside with prednisolone. He was hospitalized on May 8, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome was diagnosed. The WBC was 115,400/microliter (Ly 61.0%, Aty Ly 39.5%). Sternal tap revealed hypercellular marrow with increased lymphocytes (48.5%; Aty Ly 24.5%) and eosinophils (7.0%). Clinical chemistry revealed slightly abnormal liver and renal function with LDH (1,745 IU/l) and IgE (803 IU/ml) elevation. No pathognomonic result was obtained with several viral antibodies. CD4+, CD8+ lymphocytes and the 4/8 ratio were 39%, 43% and 0.9, respectively. Clinical and laboratory abnormalities were normalized within 3 weeks after the discontinuance of all drugs. Positive lymphocyte stimulation test results were obtained by NFLX. While drug allergy is known to be a cause of IM-like syndrome, there are few reports regarding the subset characterization of the increased T lymphocytes. In this case, T lymphocytosis was remarkable, but the 4/8 ratio declined only slightly, indicating that CD4+ as well as C8+ cells were activated and increased, unlike IM. The record of this case helps to clarify the mechanisms of the lymphocyte activation shared and not shared by EBV-induced IM and IM-like syndrome.
The paper examined the effect of 7-OH-DPAT (7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin), a dopamine D3 receptors-prefering agonist, on the catalepsy evoked by reserpine, haloperidol and fluphenazine in rats (male Wistar), as well as the influence of nafadotride, a dopamine D3 receptors-prefering antagonist, on that effect. The obtained results show that 7-OH-DPAT, as well as L-DOPA, a drug of choice in the therapy of Parkinson's disease, used for comparison, antagonize the catalepsy induced by reserpine, haloperidol and fluphenazine. Nafadotride, used in a dose (0.2 mg/kg) which inhibits the 7-OH-DPAT-evoked locomotor hyperactivity but does not affect the hypermotility induced by amphetamine and quinpirole, antagonizes the anticataleptic effect of 7-OH-DPAT or L-DOPA. It is therefore assumed that dopamine D3 receptors are involved in the anticataleptic effect of both 7-OH-DPAT and L-DOPA.
This is the report with muscle disorder associated carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced lupus. A 39-year-old female had been treated with CBZ 400 mg per day for 2 years because of complex partial seizure. In November, 1992 laboratory studies showed elevation of serum CK, IgG and titers of antinuclear antibody. Physical examination on admission revealed muscle weakness of neck flexors and iliopsoas but no rash or arthralgia. The electromyography showed myogenic change in the right biceps. CBZ was discontinued and replaced by zonisamide. Prednisolone 40 mg daily was started and the patient steadily improved. In the literature, there have been a few cases with muscle symptoms in CBZ-induced lupus, but muscle involvement with highly elevated CK associated with CBZ-induced lupus has not been reported.
Novel urinary kidney safety biomarkers have been identified recently that may outperform or add value to the conventional renal function biomarkers, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr). To assess the relative performance of the growing list of novel biomarkers, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted for 12 urinary biomarkers in 22 rat studies including 12 kidney toxicants and 10 compounds with toxicities observed in organs other than kidney. The kidney toxicity studies included kidney tubular toxicants and glomerular toxicants. The 12 urinary biomarkers evaluated included Kim-1, clusterin, osteopontin, osteoactivin, albumin, lipocalin-2, GST-α, β2-microglobulin, cystatin C, retinol binding protein 4, total protein, and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for each biomarker and for BUN and SCr to compare the relative performance of the 12 biomarkers in individual animals against the microscopic histomorphologic changes observed in the kidney. Among the kidney toxicity biomarkers analyzed, Kim-1, clusterin, and albumin showed the highest overall performance for detecting drug-induced renal tubular injury in the rat in a sensitive and specific manner, whereas albumin showed the highest performance in detecting drug-induced glomerular injury. Although most of the evaluated kidney biomarkers were more sensitive in detecting kidney toxicity compared with BUN and SCr, all biomarkers demonstrated some lack of specificity, most notably NGAL and osteopontin, illustrating the need for caution when interpreting urinary biomarker increases in rat samples when organ toxicity is unknown.
Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) has been found to be remarkably effective in the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although evidences for the proapoptotic activity of As(2)O(3) have been suggested in leukemic and other solid cancer cells, the nature of intracellular mechanisms is far from clear. In the present study, we investigated As(2)O(3) affect on the stress-responsive signaling pathways and pretreatment with antioxidants using HepG2 cells. When treated with micromolar concentrations of As(2)O(3), HepG2 cells became highly apoptotic paralleled with activation of caspase-3 and members of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) but not p38 MAP kinase. However, inhibition of each kinase activity failed to inhibit apoptosis by As(2)O(3). Addition of n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) effectively protected cells from apoptosis and significantly lowered As(2)O(3)-induced activation of caspase-3. However, neither NAC nor DPI was able to effect ERK or JNK activation induced by As(2)O(3). Guanidinoethyldisulfide dihydrochloride (GED) and 2-ethyl-2-thiopseudourea (ETU), known inhibitors of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), also suppressed the apoptotic activity of As(2)O(3). These results suggest that As2O3 induces caspase-mediated apoptosis involving a mechanism generating oxidative stress. However, activation of some stress-responsive signaling pathways by As(2)O(3) may not be the major determinant in the course of apoptotic processes.
Two patients developed seizure immediately after flumazenil administration that aimed to reverse the prolonged sedative effect of diazepam. The use of benzodiazepine for sedation in ICU may mask valuable information relevant to an ongoing pathological change. The seizure in our patients seemed most likely to result from septic encephalopathy which was unmasked by flumazenil. However, flumazenil has the potential to provoke seizure and should be used with caution.
The purpose of the present investigation was to explore further the hypothesis that the self-injurious behavior induced by L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in neonatal-6-hydroxydopamine (OHDA)-lesioned rats is associated with an action on D1 dopamine receptors. This was accomplished by examining the behavioral responses induced by SKF-38393, quinpirole, and L-DOPA after treatment with the D1 antagonist SCH-23390 and three new pharmacologic agents, SCH-39166, NO-0756, and A-69024, reported to be D1 antagonists. All putative D1 antagonists were found to antagonize the action of SKF-38393 without reducing the increased locomotion and behavioral responses induced by quinpirole, consistent with an in vivo action on D1 receptors. The potency hierarchy of the compounds against the action of SKF-38393 on activity, from strongest to weakest, was: SCH-39166 equaled SCH-23390 and these were greater than NO-0756, which was greater than A-69024. All compounds were found to antagonize L-DOPA-induced self-mutilatory behavior (SMB) in neonatal-6-OHDA-lesioned rats in a dose-related manner. The potency hierarchy against this behavior, from strongest to weakest, was: SCH-23390, SCH-39166, NO-0756, and A-69024. The correlation between the ED50 for the ability of these drugs to antagonize SKF-38393-induced activity and their ability to reduce SMB by L-DOPA was greater than 0.99. In conclusion, the present findings provide additional evidence in vivo that NO-0756, SCH-39166, and A-69024 are selective D1 receptor antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Previous studies suggest that dopamine antagonists may reduce the reinforcing effects of cocaine. However, the effects of these antagonists on the demand for smoked cocaine base have not been quantified.
To evaluate the effects of selective D1 (SCH 23390) and D2 (raclopride) dopamine receptor antagonists on the demand for smoked cocaine base in rhesus monkeys using a behavioral economic analysis.
Six rhesus monkeys were trained to self-administer smoked cocaine base (1.0 mg/kg/delivery) under chained fixed-ratio (FR) schedules (FR64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 or 2048 for lever presses and FR5 for inhalations) during daily 4-h sessions. A maximum of ten smoke deliveries were available. After 5 days of stable behavior at each FR, SCH 23390 (0.01 and 0.056 mg/kg) or raclopride (0.03 and 0.056 mg/kg) were injected intramuscularly, before each session, for 3 consecutive days.
Pretreatment with both antagonists dose-dependently reduced cocaine intake across most FR values tested; however, the decrease in consumption was greater at the higher unit prices than at the lower unit prices. A statistical estimate of the price (FR) at which maximum responding occurred (Pmax) was decreased during drug pretreatment, indicating weakened reinforcing effectiveness of cocaine.
These data suggest that both antagonists reduce the reinforcing effectiveness of smoked cocaine base, and they have a greater effect on cocaine consumption at higher FR values.
The effects of chronic glucocorticoid treatment on sympathoadrenomedullary function were assessed in conscious unrestrained Wistar-Kyoto rats. Cortisol (25 mg/kg.day), administered for 7 days using a sc reservoir pump, suppressed activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, as indicated by markedly decreased levels of corticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone and decreased adrenal weight. Cortisol also decreased body weight and increased blood pressure to hypertensive levels without affecting plasma sodium or potassium. Basal levels of plasma epinephrine were markedly decreased, indicating suppression of adrenomedullary secretion. Plasma norepinephrine levels also were decreased, but to a smaller extent than epinephrine, and levels of dihydroxyphenylglycol, an intraneuronal metabolite of norepinephrine, were unaffected. Plasma catecholamine responses to nitroprusside-induced hypotension were not altered by cortisol. The results suggest that chronic cortisol treatment suppresses basal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical and basal adrenomedullary activity in conscious unrestrained rats without impairing reflexive activation of the sympathoadrenomedullary system.
Various dopaminergic drugs have been studied for their efficacy in the treatment of cocaine addiction. Pretreatment with either selective dopamine D1 receptor agonists or selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonists prevents reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in animal models of drug craving and relapse. We tested a novel ergoline derivative with combined D1 agonistic and D2 antagonistic effects, 9,10-didehydro- N-methyl- N-(2-propynyl)-6-methyl-8beta-aminomethylergoline bimaleate (LEK-8829), for its effects on cocaine-seeking in the intravenous cocaine self-administration model in rats. Pretreatment with systemic injections of LEK-8829 attenuated reinstatement of cocaine-seeking induced by cocaine priming injections and diminished cocaine intake in cocaine self-administration sessions. LEK-8829 itself did not induce reinstatement of cocaine-seeking and did not maintain intravenous self-administration. The results of our study indicate that LEK-8829 is a candidate medication for the treatment of cocaine craving in cocaine addiction.
The aim of the study was to analyse the astrocyte ultrastructure within the hippocampal gyre cortex and neocortex of the temporal lobe in valproate encephalopathy induced by chronic administration of an anti-epileptic drug - sodium valproate (VPA) to rats for 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, once daily intragastrically, in a dose of 200 mg/kg b.w. and after its withdrawal for 1 and 3 months. Prolonged application of VPA caused damage to protoplasmic astrocytes of the cortex regions examined, mainly in the pyramidal layer, which intensified in the later stages of the experiment, especially after 9 and 12 months. Ultrastructural alterations in astroglia during this experiment did not differ significantly between the hippocampal cortex and neocortex. The most pronounced astroglial abnormalities, concerning about 2/3 of protoplasmic astrocytes after 9 and 12 months, were characterized by considerable swelling of cells, with the presence of empty vacuolar structures in the cytoplasm, a substantial decrease in the number of gliofilaments or even their complete loss, which indicated fibrillopoietic failure of the cell, and the appearance of astrocytes showing phagocytic activity. The astrocytic changes coexisted with distinct damage to neurones and structural elements of the blood-brain barrier. One month after termination of chronic exposure to the drug, the abnormalities did not subside, whereas after 3 months features of distinct normalization could be observed in a considerable number, more than a half, of astrocytes. In valproate encephalopathy, apart from any direct effect of VPA and/or its metabolites on astrocytes, the main cause of the protoplasmic astroglial damage in the cortex of the CNS structures examined could be associated with changes in microcirculation in the cortex (vasogenic factor), leading to its ischaemia.
Idiosyncratic generalized skin disorders complicated by hepatitis, which resemble severe drug hypersensitivities, occur sporadically in workers exposed to trichloroethylene (TCE) in China. However, it has been a matter of controversy whether the solvent itself, not its impurities or stabilizers, can cause hypersensitivity reactions or not. This study aimed to characterize the exposure of hospitalized patients and their healthy colleagues. TCE metabolites were measured in urine of 19 hospitalized patients suffering from the disorders. To assess the exposure of patients' healthy colleagues, on-site surveys were conducted in 6 factories where the disorders occurred and in 2 control factories without such occurrences despite TCE use. Urinalysis of the patients detected trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in all of them. Its average concentration in the end-of-shift urine was estimated to be 206 mg/l. On-site survey of healthy exposed workers revealed that the maximum urinary TCA concentrations and the maximum time-weighted average concentrations of personal TCE exposure were 318-1,617 mg/l and 164-2,330 mg/m(3), respectively. There was no common impurity in TCE used in the factories. These results suggested that TCE itself caused the skin hypersensitivity disorders, and that the disorders occurred in factories where TCE metabolites could be extensively accumulated, possibly due to long working hours. Since the lowest TCA concentration in the end-of-shift urine of the patients was estimated to be 72-80 mg/l, it is recommended to control TCE exposure to keep the urinary TCA concentration below 50 mg/l to reduce the disease risk.
Adverse effects of amlodipine besylate, a widely used antihypertensive medication, include peripheral edema, flushing, headache, pruritus, and rash. An adverse renal effect attributable to the medication has hitherto not been reported in the literature. We herein report a case of amlodipine besylate induced acute interstitial nephritis.
We assessed the influence of maternal nicotine exposure during gestation on perinatal expression of HSP70 and VEGF in rat lung parenchyma and lung vessels. Adult white Sprague-Dawley virgin rats were mated with adult male rats over 2 days, with two females for every male. After confirming pregnancy, 30 gravid rats (dams) were then randomly assigned to two equal groups (one experimental and one control; n=15 in each). Experimental dams were treated with subcutaneus (s.c.) (-)-nicotine tartrate, 3 mg/kg body weight/day, during pregnancy from gestational days 9 through 21. After sacrifice, lungs were removed en bloc and formalin-fixed, and paraffinembedded tissue sections were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using a three-step streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method with monoclonal antibodies directed against HSP70 or VEGF. HSP70 and VEGF expression was increased in the vascular smooth muscle cells of the experimental group (t1) compared to the control group (t(2))t(1)=7.593, t(2)=4.666, p<0.05). The number of bronchioles that stained positively with HSP70 was higher in the nicotineexposed group than in the control group (t(1)=9.274, t(2)=6.956, p<0.05). In conclusion, gestational nicotine exposure increased the expression of VEGF and HSP70 in rat lung parenchyma, especially in the airway epithelium and vascular smooth muscle cells. In vascular smooth muscle cells, these molecules may contribute to nicotine-related hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.
To increase the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we have tried to add etoposide (VP-16) to busulfan/cyclophosphamide (BU/CY). Twelve patients received 16 mg/kg of BU and 120 mg/kg of CY with 15-30 mg/kg of VP-16. Another two patients received 5 micrograms/kg of G-CSF with 30 mg/kg of VP-16. Patients tolerated escalating doses of VP-16 without any significant hepatotoxicity. Their maximal level of bilirubin was 37.6 micromol/L (2.2 mg/dl), and there was no significant skin toxicity or mucositis. By contrast, two patients who received G-CSF with 30 mg/kg of VP-16 developed hyperbilirubinemia and veno-occlusive disease, which terminated this phase I study. VP-16 can be safely combined with BU/CY < or = 30 mg/kg in three divided doses, and its effect on survival should be evaluated. G-CSF added to this regimen, however, should be used with great caution.
The sharp interruption of the intracortical instillation of exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), generates an epileptic focus in mammals. Seizures elicited by GABA withdrawal last several days or weeks. The present work reports that GABA withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability can be produced in vitro: a sudden withdrawal of GABA (5 mM; 120 min) or benzodiazepine (60 microM flunitrazepam) from the superfusion, induced a gradual increase in the amplitude of the evoked population spike (PS) recorded on neocortical slices. PS enhancement reached 150% above the control value 2.5 h after GABA withdrawal. GABA withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability was facilitated by progesterone. PS enhancement induced by GABA withdrawal was associated with an impairment of GABA transmission occurring before epileptiform discharges were fully established. Paired pulse inhibition and evoked [3H]-GABA release appear decreased; suggesting that cortical hyperexcitability as a result of GABA withdrawal involves pre-synaptic changes. Specific muscimol binding decreased during GABA superfusion but recovered after GABA withdrawal. However, the sensitivity of the post-synaptic response to 3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one or allopregnanolone (alloP) was enhanced after GABA withdrawal, suggesting a functional change in the GABA(A) receptors. The changes described may be the cellular correlates of the withdrawal syndromes appearing after interruption of the administration of GABA(A) receptor agonists.
The prognosis of advanced melanoma is generally poor, because this tumor commonly exhibits intrinsic or acquired resistance to chemotherapy. In an attempt to identify the underlying causes of this resistance, we studied the roles played by the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (OGAT) and the mismatch repair (MMR) system in the sensitivity of melanoma cells to temozolomide (TMZ), 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP). To this end, OGAT levels and MMR efficiency of extracts of nine melanoma cell lines and selected clones derived from four of these lines were determined and correlated with the sensitivity of the respective cells to these drugs. The effectiveness of O(6)-benzylguanine (BG), a specific OGAT inhibitor, in potentiating TMZ- or BCNU-mediated cytotoxicity was also evaluated. Our results demonstrate that MMR efficiency and OGAT levels strongly affect melanoma cell sensitivity to TMZ. In MMR-proficient cells, a direct correlation between OGAT levels and TMZ IC(50) values was found. When OGAT activity was inhibited with BG, the sensitivity of these cells to TMZ increased and was then dictated largely by their MMR efficiency. MMR-deficient cells were highly resistant to the drug irrespective of their OGAT levels. Although OGAT activity and MMR status seemed to be the major determinants of melanoma sensitivity to TMZ, this was not the case for BCNU and CDDP; resistance to the latter drugs clearly involves processes other than the two DNA repair pathways analyzed in this study.
Leg paralysis and wallerian degeneration of sciatic nerve fibres have been produced in rats by intraneural injection of 0.5, 1 or 5 micrograms of vincristine (VCR) or formyl leurosine (FLR) dissolved in 5 microliters of saline. Nerve lesions were dose-related, and were similar for equal concentrations of the two drugs. Six patients received one to three 5-day courses of FLR. The total dose of FLR administered ranged from 15 to 131 mg (mean 83 mg). Clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy were absent in four patients, and limited to orthostatic hypotension in one case and transient depression of reflexes in another. Motor conduction velocities measured in four peripheral nerves, and muscle evoked potentials remained unchanged throughout the treatment in all patients.
The aim of the study was to investigate the toxicity of hexachloronaphthalene (HxCN) and its effect on cytochrome P-450 in rats and to make a comparison between HxCN and tetrachloronaphthalene (TeCN), an inactive congener. Our study provided evidence that the anorectic effect, with concurrent significant increase in relative liver mass was the most spectacular symptom of the toxic effect of hexachloronaphthalene in the rats after its single (250mg/kg) and repeated (1 and 10mg/kg) administration. Regardless of the kind of the experiment (acute or subacute toxicity), dose-dependent increase in lipid peroxidation in the liver was also observed, which may indicate that HxCN most probably generates oxidative stress in this organ. It was also observed that HxCN is a very strong inducer of cytochrome P-450, especially of CYP 1A, which is the most sensitive biomarker of exposure to this congener. In this study, LOAEL is 1mg HxCN/kgb.w.
Effects of Hyoscyamus niger L on central nervous system have been known for many years. The effects of methanolic extract of H. niger L. on seizures induced by picrotoxin was studied in mice in this investigation. In this study 7 groups of animals pretreated with methanolic extract of the plant (12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 mg/kg/i.p.), 20 minutes prior to the picrotoxin (12 mg/kg/ i.p.)--induced seizures. Control mice received phenobarbital (40 mg/kg/i.p.) as positive control, or saline (10 ml/kg) as negative control. The latency of seizure (sec), duration of seizure (sec) and mortality rate were determined in test and control groups. The results of this study showed that latency of seizure was increased in groups that were pretreated with doses of 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/kg of extract. In addition, methanolic extract of H. niger L. delayed the death time in mice as compared to control that was significant with doses of 200, 300 and 400 mg/kg. The most effective dose of extract was 300 mg/kg in this investigation (P<0.01). In conclusion, the results showed that methanolic extract of H. niger L. posses the anticonvulsant activity against picrotoxin-induced seizures in mice. The exact mechanism(s) by which the plant exerts its anticonvulsant activity is not determined yet.
Extrapyramidal symptoms developed a variable time after the start of treatment with oral diazoxide in 15% of a series of 100 severely hypertensive patients. Six illustrative cases are described. Treatment with diazoxide could be continued in four of these. The symptoms are usually controllable either by dosage adjustment or by the use of diazepam or procyclidine. There was no evidence of irreversibility of the extrapyramidal syndromes observed.
The leaves extract of Catharanthus roseus was investigated for hypotensive and hypolipidemic effects in adrenaline-induced hypertensive rats (AIHR) and compared with those of Atenolol in a crossover design. The pharmacologically Active components responsible for hypotensive activities were isolated from plant using bioassay guided purification approach and the structure of the compounds was proposed by spectroscopic methods. Catharanthus roseus leaves extract and commercial drug Atenolol were administered through intraperitoneal (i.p) route for one week. Different biochemical parameters such as heart weight, blood glucose level, serum cholesterol level, serum triglyceride level, body weight and the relationships between them were measured. Catharanthus roseus leaves extract at a dose of 30 mg/155+/-15 gm of body weight was injected in rat at every morning during the treatment period. The dose of Atenolol was determined according to its pharmacokinetic parameters. Clinically effective plasma concentration as a hypotensive drug was obtained after the injection of 0.1 mg/155+/-15 gm of body weight of the drug. The Catharanthus roseus leaves extract made significant changes in each cardiovascular parameter after investigation. Catharanthus roseus leaves extract treated animals have shown the hypotensive effects. Hypotensive effects were also shown by Atenolol.
Resveratrol (RV), an antioxidant, inhibits angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophy and Ang II- or epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced Akt phosphorylation in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Both signalling pathways are reported to utilize reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of this study was to show whether RV reduces the ROS level in Ang II- or EGF-activated VSMCs and whether reduction of ROS causes the impeded signalling towards Akt in the presence of RV.
We show here that RV reduces intracellular ROS and extracellular H₂O₂ release from VSMCs as measured using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate and Amplex Red™. Since NADPH oxidases (Nox) 1 and 4 are major ROS sources in VSMCs, we examined their need for Akt phosphorylation in response to Ang II or EGF. Experiments using the blocking peptide gp91ds-tat verified a role for Nox1 in Ang II signalling towards Akt, but excluded a role for Nox1 in the respective EGF signalling. A small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of Nox4 showed that Nox4 was not required for Ang II- or EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation. Use of the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, N-acetyl-cysteine, and non-antioxidant RV derivatives revealed that the antioxidant capacity of RV is not required for the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, in both rat and human VSMCs.
Thus, although RV acts as an antioxidant, the antihypertrophic response of RV in VSMCs and the signalling downstream of the EGF receptor towards Akt seem to be largely redox independent.
A self-administered symptom questionnaire was completed by 477 patients in a hypertension clinic. The complaints of the patients were analysed according to the type of therapy being given and the dose of drug taken. Methyldopa therapy was associated with sleepiness, weakness of the limbs, sleeping longer at night, and rising more frequently at night to pass urine. Diarrhoea, impotence, failure of ejaculation, blurred vision, depression, and the symptoms of postural hypotension were not related to methyldopa therapy. Bethanidine administration was related to postural hypotension, impotence, and failure of ejaculation but not to weakness of the limbs, blurred vision, depression, or diarrhoea. Patients receiving guanethidine complained of postural hypotension, failure of ejaculation, and had their bowels open more frequently. Similarly, patients receiving propranolol had an increased frequency of defaecation but also tended to complain of weakness of the limbs.Considering each drug individually, 5% of patients failed to take the prescribed dose of diuretic whereas
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder caused by mutations of the LDL-receptor gene and transmitted as a co-dominant trait. However, there are some forms of hypercholesterolemia which have a recessive type of transmission. We have identified a subject with the clinical phenotype of heterozygous FH whose parents had normal plasma lipid values, suggesting a recessive type of transmission. The analysis of the LDL-receptor gene revealed that the patient was heterozygous for a G>C transversion in exon 4, which results in a serine for cysteine substitution at position 88 (C88S) of the receptor protein. Since this novel mutation was not found in the proband's parents and non-paternity was excluded, we concluded that the patient was a carrier of a "de novo" mutation. Haplotype analysis of LDL-receptor locus indicated that this "de novo" mutation occurred in the paternal germ line. The C88S mutation is the likely cause of LDL-receptor defect as it was present in the proband's hypercholesterolemic son and was not found in 200 chromosomes of control subjects.
