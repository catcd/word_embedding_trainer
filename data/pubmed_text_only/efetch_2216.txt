Mycophenolic acid (MPA) pharmacokinetics using the mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) formulation are known to differ between patients receiving tacrolimus or cyclosporine, but only limited data exist concerning concomitant use of tacrolimus and enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS).
In this six-month, multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial, 63 maintenance renal transplant patients receiving tacrolimus were converted from mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to EC-MPS.
MPA concentration-time profiles in 21 patients showed that MPA exposure was similar with MMF or EC-MPS (mean area under the curve 39.9+/-11.6 microg x h/mL versus 43.7+/-17.4 microg x h/mL at day 14 post-conversion). Median time to peak concentration was 0.5 hr with MMF and 1.5 hr with EC-MPS. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity was almost identical: area under the enzyme activity time curve (AEC) was 124.2+/-32.0 nmol x h/mg prot/h with MMF and 130.3+/-36.6 nmol x h/mg prot/h with EC-MPS at 14 days post-conversion; average daytime IMPDH activity was 10.3+/-2.7 nmol/h/mg protein and 10.9+/-2.7 nmol/h/mg protein, respectively. Maximal daytime inhibition of IMPDH activity was 67% with MMF and 62% with EC-MPS at day 14. One patient (1.6%) experienced mild biopsy-proven acute rejection. No graft losses or deaths occurred. Renal function remained stable (mean calculated creatinine clearance 70.6+/-26.8 mL/min with MMF and 68.8+/-25.4 mL/min six months post-conversion). Adverse events or infections with a suspected relation to EC-MPS occurred in 12 patients (19%). Four patients discontinued EC-MPS due to adverse events or infections.
MMF and EC-MPS are associated with similar MPA exposure and equivalent pharmacodynamic effect. Conversion of tacrolimus-treated maintenance renal transplant patients from MMF to EC-MPS is safe and well-tolerated and does not compromise therapeutic efficacy.
The authors investigated the relation between ionizing radiation and lymphoma mortality in 2 cohorts: 1) 20,940 men in the Life Span Study, a study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors who were aged 15-64 years at the time of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and 2) 15,264 male nuclear weapons workers who were hired at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina between 1950 and 1986. Radiation dose-mortality trends were evaluated for all malignant lymphomas and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Positive associations between lymphoma mortality and radiation dose under a 5-year lag assumption were observed in both cohorts (excess relative rates per sievert were 0.79 (90% confidence interval: 0.10, 1.88) and 6.99 (90% confidence interval: 0.96, 18.39), respectively). Exclusion of deaths due to Hodgkin's disease led to small changes in the estimates of association. In each cohort, evidence of a dose-response association was primarily observed more than 35 years after irradiation. These findings suggest a protracted induction and latency period for radiation-induced lymphoma mortality.
The antiviral agent foscarnet has long been used in our unit to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in renal transplant patients. The clinical effect has been convincing and, apart from changes in serum calcium levels, very few side effects have been noted. We have, however, observed a nephrotoxic reaction in a series of patients with initially good renal function who therefore received high doses of foscarnet. Transplant biopsies performed in five of those patients revealed degenerative changes in the tubular epithelial cells as well as tubular calcium deposits and an infiltration of the interstitium by mixed mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Renal insufficiency was accompanied by high fever. After withdrawal of the drug, the temperature rapidly normalized, whereas serum creatinine continued to rise for about 3 days and then fell back towards previous levels. We conclude that transplant biopsies are of great value in distinguishing between a foscarnet nephrotoxic effect and CMV nephritis, various forms of rejection, and other causes of impaired renal function.
Overdrive stimulation of reentrant ventricular tachycardias (VT) may result in entrainment and/or termination of these arrhythmias. We investigated whether surface ECG criteria of entrainment can also be observed in nonreentrant VT. For this purpose ouabain-induced tachycardias were used that are considered to be based on delayed afterdepolarizations. In nine conscious dogs, having surgically induced complete AV block, pacing was performed using trains of 20 stimuli from a site distant to the origin of the VT. The pacing intervals were shortened in steps of 5-10 msec, until complete capture from the pacing site or termination of the VT was obtained. During stimulation variable fusion was seen and complete capture of the ventricles from the pacing site occurred just after a slight decrease in pacing cycle length (20 +/- 10 msec). Overdrive stimulation resulted only in 1 out of 58 stimulation trains in termination of VT. Following stimulation it was observed that: (1) The length of the first postpacing interval was significantly longer (P less than 0.001) than both the mean prepacing VT cycle length and interstimulus interval; (2) A change in QRS configuration occurred after 57% of the stimulation trains; (3) The VT accelerated slightly in comparison to the prepacing rate (P less than 0.05); and (4) The length of the first postpacing interval and the mean R-R interval of the VT postpacing were directly related to the interstimulus interval (r = 0.82 and 0.97, respectively). In conclusion, overdrive stimulation of ouabain-induced arrhythmias did not result in entrainment or in termination of the tachycardia. Instead, other responses were seen that may be of help in differentiating between arrhythmias caused by delayed afterdepolarizations and reentry.
Captopril, a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Captopril is known to be associated with dermatologic, hematologic, and pulmonary adverse effects. However, hepatotoxicity is extremely rare. A patient with severe cholestatic jaundice induced by captopril is presented. On admission to the hospital, the patient was diagnosed and treated as having cholangitis. Review of the literature showed similar occurrences in other patients. Patients treated with captopril who develop "atypical cholangitis" should be suspected of having captopril-associated liver damage.
Pharmacological and biochemical properties of a novel compound, N-(1-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinyl)-5-chloro-2-methoxy-4-methylaminobenzamide (YM-08050) were compared with those of haloperidol (HPD) and chlorpromazine (CPZ) in animals. YM-08050 was more potent than either HPD or CPZ in inhibitory effects on a variety of behaviors such as apomorphine-induced stereotypes behavior and emesis, methamphetamine-induced stereotyped behavior, conditioned avoidance response and open field behavior. YM-08050 induced catalepsy only at much higher doses than to exhibit the inhibitory activities. The inhibitory effects of YM-08050 on [3H]dopamine binding and dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in the synaptic membrane fractions of canine caudate nucleus were much greater than those of HPD and CPZ. The results suggest that YM-08050, a potent central dopaminergic blocker, is a potential antipsychotic drug with less extrapyramidal side effects than those of HPD and CPZ.
The need for an additional dose of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) was studied by comparing infants receiving 1 ml HBIg at birth followed by hepatitis B immunization, concomitant with DTP-polio vaccine, at 3, 4, 5 and 11 months (schedule E), with infants receiving the same schedule with additional HBIg at 3 months (schedule F). The immune response to recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (20 micrograms) was evaluated in 195 infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers allocated to groups E and F and compared with historic controls who received plasma vaccine (10 micrograms) according to schedule F. Blood samples were drawn at 0, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12 and 24 months of age. No difference in efficacy between the two schedules was observed; 8 and 6% of infants born to HBeAg-positive HBsAg carrier mothers in groups E and F, respectively, became HBsAg carriers. Passively acquired antibodies at birth remained present for about 5 months in most infants. The seroprotection rates (anti-HBs > or = 10 IU l-1) were over 90% at all time points and similar for groups E and F. The titres of anti-HBs attained during the first 6 months were statistically lower (p < or = 0.02) for group E than for group F but similar thereafter. Anti-HBs titres in infants receiving the recombinant vaccine were significantly lower than in infants receiving the plasma vaccine (p < 0.001). Supplemental doses of HBIg in infants receiving a high dose of HBIg ( > 200 IU) at birth and the first dose of vaccine at the age of 3 months are not advised.
Recent studies have demonstrated that polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial chemicals, could disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis and exhibit neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and embryotoxicity. However, clear evidence of embryotoxicity and neurotoxicity of many of these congeners, such as deca-BDE, one of the least bioactive congeners of PBDEs, is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated deca-BDE embryotoxicity by quantitative analysis of two essential thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) and a variety of small-molecule metabolites in the serum of deca-BDE-dosed pregnant mice. Four groups of pregnant C57 mice were administrated with deca-BDE in 20% fat emulsion at a dose of 150, 750, 1,500, or 2,500 mg/kg body weight via gastric intubation on gestation days (g.d.s) 7 to 9, while a control group was given 20% fat emulsion. Maternal mice were euthanized on g.d. 16 and examined for external malformations of the fetus. Maternal serum samples were collected and analyzed by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS). Using multivariate statistical analysis, we observed a significantly altered metabolic profile associated with deca-BDE embryotoxicity in maternal serum. Our results also demonstrated that deca-BDE at a dose of 2 500 mg/kg body weight induced significant disruption of thyroid hormone metabolism, the TCA cycle, and lipid metabolism in maternal mice, which subsequently led to a significant inhibition of fetal growth and development. We concluded that deca-BDE-induced embryotoxicity closely correlated with global metabolic disruption that can be characterized by thyroid hormone deficiency, disrupted lipid metabolism, and a depleted level of cholesterol in maternal mice.
Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with all-trans retinoic acid and/or arsenic trioxide represents a paradigm in targeted cancer therapy because these drugs cause clinical remission by affecting the stability of the fusion oncoprotein promyelocytic leukemia (PML)/retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA). The authors of previous studies have implicated the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as the main mechanism involved in therapy-induced PML/RARA degradation. Here we have investigated a role of autophagy, a protein degradation pathway that involves proteolysis of intracellular material within lysosomes. We found that both all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide induce autophagy via the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in APL cells and that autophagic degradation contributes significantly both to the basal turnover as well as the therapy-induced proteolysis of PML/RARA. In addition, we observed a correlation between autophagy and therapy-induced differentiation of APL cells. Given the central role of the PML/RARA oncoprotein in APL pathogenesis, this study highlights an important role of autophagy in the development and treatment of this disease.
Left ventricular (LV) remodelling following myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Previous data suggest that angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a central role in the molecular events contributing to LV remodelling. We explored the effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition versus Ang II (AT(1)) receptor blockade on LV remodelling in mice post-MI. Mice underwent sham procedure or left coronary artery ligation, and received placebo, the AT(1) receptor antagonist, losartan or the ACE inhibitor, enalapril. At 6 weeks, echocardiography and haemodynamic studies were performed. Infarct size and interstitial collagen content were determined. Expression of genes encoding atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), collagen type I, AT(1a) and AT(1b) receptors were measured. The placebo MI group showed increased LV end-diastolic diameter, LV end-systolic diameter with depressed fractional shortening ( P <0.01 versus shams), increased LV mass and volume (both P <0.01 versus shams). The placebo MI group also exhibited increased non-infarct zone collagen content ( P <0.01), ANP ( P <0.01) and collagen type 1 ( P <0.01) gene expression, with a non-significant rise in AT(1a) receptor gene expression. Neither losartan or enalapril prevented LV dilation or improved fractional shortening. Both similarly lowered systolic blood pressure ( P <0.01 for each versus placebo). Losartan and enalapril inhibited LV hypertrophy ( P <0.01), and decreased ANP ( P <0.01) and collagen type 1 gene expression ( P <0.05). Levels of AT(1a) receptor gene expression were higher than shams ( P <0.05 for both), but similar to placebo. AT(1b) receptor gene expression was much lower than that for AT(1a) receptor and similar in all groups. Thus, in this model, AT(1) receptor antagonism and ACE inhibition have equivalent inhibitory effects on myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. These results serve as an important basis for planned investigations to evaluate the anti-remodelling effects of these agents on mice in which genetic manipulations are used to disrupt components of the Ang II signalling system.
Worldwide, the use of cocaine has an increased over the years, various secondary effects have been described. Here we present a 48 years old female with a 2-month evolution bucconasal ulcer in the hard palate induced by cocaine usage accompanied by swallow and phonation dysfunctions. Ethiopathogenesis, differential diagnoses and treatment are discussed.
The opioid-like neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) and its receptor (NOP) are expressed in the substantia nigra (SN), a brain area containing dopamine neurons that degenerate in Parkinson's disease. Endogenous N/OFQ facilitates nigral glutamate release and inhibits nigrostriatal dopamine transmission and motor behavior. Here, we present evidence suggesting that endogenous N/OFQ may contribute to Parkinson's disease. Pharmacological blockade of the SN N/OFQ-NOP receptor system attenuated parkinsonian-like akinesia/hypokinesia in 6-hydroxydopamine hemilesioned or haloperidol-treated rats, whereas deletion of the NOP receptor gene conferred mice partial protection from haloperidol-induced motor depression. The antiparkinsonian action of NOP receptor antagonists was associated with reduction of glutamate release in the SN. In 6-hydroxydopamine hemilesioned rats, enhancement of N/OFQ expression and release was detected in the lesioned compared with the unlesioned SN, indicating that parkinsonism may be associated with overactivation of the N/OFQ-NOP receptor system in the SN. Finally, deletion of the N/OFQ gene conferred mice partial protection against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced loss of SN dopamine neurons. Based on these data, we propose that NOP receptor antagonists may represent a novel approach for combined (symptomatic and neuroprotective) therapy of Parkinson's disease.
In order to define the role of As2O3 in regulating the tumor cell invasiveness, the effects of As2O3 on secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and in vitro invasion of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were examined. As2O3 inhibited cell adhesion to the collagen matrix in a concentration dependent manner, whereas the same treatment enhanced cell to cell interaction. In addition, As2O3 inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-aceate (PMA), and suppressed the expression of MMP-2, -9, membrane type-1 MMP, uPA, and uPA receptor (uPAR). In contrast, As2O3 increased the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and PA inhibitor (PAI)-1, and reduced the MMP-2, -9, and uPA promoter activity in the presence and absence of PMA. Furthermore, the promoter stimulating and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was blocked by As2O3, whereas the activator protein-1 activity was unchanged. Pretreatment of the cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly prevented suppression of MMPs and uPA secretion, DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB, and in vitro invasion of HT1080 cells by As2O3, suggesting a role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this process. These results suggest that As2O3 inhibits tumor cell invasion by modulating the MMPs/TIMPs and uPA/uPAR/PAI systems of extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. In addition, the generation of ROS and subsequent suppression of NF-kappaB activity by As2O3 might partly be responsible for the phenomena. Overall, As2O3 shows potent activity controlling tumor cell invasiveness in vitro.
In an attempt to address the schedule of adjuvant chemotherapy in surgically resected T1 or T2NOMO small cell lung cancer, 12 patients were randomized to receive 6 courses of either single-agent (high-dose epirubicin) or combination (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and etoposide) chemotherapy, at 3-week intervals. No thoracic radiotherapy was administered while prophylactic cranial irradiation (30 Gy/10 fractions/2 weeks) was given. With a 25-month median followup, overall estimated 2-year and median survival were 83% and 26.5 months (range 16-34+), respectively. Ten patients are currently alive and disease free. No significant difference in 2-year survival was observed between the two adjuvant treatment modalities and median survival was 28 months (range 13-34+) for combination and 21 months (range 14-29+) for single-agent chemotherapy. Although at high doses, epirubicin resulted in a moderate clinical and histological cardiotoxicity and a remarkably reduced incidence of severe (WHO grades 3 and 4) treatment-related morbidity compared with the combination regimen. These preliminary results suggest that comparable survival and reduced toxicity might be expected with an active single-agent as adjuvant chemotherapy in T1 or T2NOMO small cell lung cancer.
The hypotensive actions of nicergoline, a new alpha 1-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, were studied in six dogs during stable anaesthesia under mechanical ventilation. Systemic haemodynamic parameters were measured before the infusion of nicergoline (500 micrograms X kg-1 in 5 min), and regularly after it during 2 h. Plasma renin activity (PRA), right atrial (V PGE2) and arterial (A PGE2) prostaglandin E2 concentrations measured by radio-immunoassay were collected before, and 10 and 20 min after nicergoline infusion. The mean aortic pressure fell to its lowest figure (-30%) at the 5th min, this being maintained for 45 min. Heart rate and cardiac output remained unchanged. Pulmonary wedge pressure (p less than 0.01) and central venous pressure (p less than 0.05) decreased. All parameters reached their control values in 120 min. PRA was unchanged. V PGE2 (p less than 0.01) and pulmonary extraction in PGE2 (V PGE2 - A PGE2/V PGE2) (p less than 0,05) increased whilst A PGE2 was unmodified. The fall in mean aortic pressure was linked (p less than 0.001) to the increase in V PGE2. Nicergoline infusion induced hypotension by reducing vascular tone of resistance and capacitance beds. Hypotension was related to the vasoplegia and to an inhibition of the rapid pressor control mechanisms. The reasons for the lack of renin release were unknown. V PGE2 release was stimulated by the hypotension. The increase in pulmonary extraction in PGE2 was involved in the maintenance of A PGE2 concentration. Nicergoline gave mild hypotension without reflex sympathetic activation. Its alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking properties were similar to those of prazosin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Since no nursing policy on flushing procedures existed in their small community hospital, the authors thought it would be useful to clarify recent reports of the equivalency of saline to heparin flushes in their patient group before establishment of such a policy. They conducted a 2 month double-blinded, cross-over study of catheter failures when using either saline or heparin 10 units/mL flushing solutions. All medical and surgical floor patients were included in the study. Floor nurses were used as observers and characterized catheter failures as either loss of patency or phlebitis. Heparin was shown to cause more phlebitis than saline (p less than .025), but no difference was found between the two flushing solutions in loss of patency. Data revealed a statistically significant advantage to using saline flushes when both loss of patency and phlebitis were combined (p less than .05). They recommended adoption of a flushing procedure which did not contain heparin.
Excitation-transcriptional coupling involves communication between plasma membrane ion channels and gene expression in the nucleus. Calcium influx through L-type Ca(2+) channels induces phosphorylation of the transcription factor, cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and downstream activation of the cyclic-AMP response element (CRE) promoter regions. Tyrosine nitration of Ca(2+) channels attenuates interactions with c-Src kinase, decreasing Ca(2+) channel currents and smooth muscle contraction during colonic inflammation. In this study we examined the effect of tyrosine nitration and colonic inflammation on Ca(2+) channel mediated phosphorylation of CREB and CRE activation.
CREB and phospho-CREB were detected by Western blots and CRE activation measured by dual luciferase assay. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with hCa(v)1.2b and hCa(v)1.2b c-terminal mutants. Colonic inflammation was induced by intracolonic instillation of 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid in mouse colon.
In hCa(v)1.2b transfected CHO cells and in native colonic smooth muscle, depolarization with 80 mM KCl induced CREB phosphorylation (pCREB). Treatment with peroxynitrite inhibited KCl-induced pCREB. Following experimental colitis, KCl-induced CREB phosphorylation was abolished in smooth muscle, concomitant with tyrosine nitration of Ca(2+) channels. Depolarization increased CRE activation in hCa(v)1.2b CHO cells by 2.35 fold which was blocked by nifedipine and by protein nitration of Ca(2+) channels with peroxynitrite. The Src-kinase inhibitor, PP2, blocked depolarization-induced CRE activation. Mutation of the C-terminus tyrosine residue, Y2134F, but not Y1861F, blocked CRE activation.
Post-translational modification of Ca(2+) channels due to tyrosine nitration modified excitation-transcriptional coupling in colonic inflammation.
T-817MA (1-{3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-yl)ethoxy]propyl} azetidin-3-ol maleate) is a candidate therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease that inhibits oxidative stress and nitric oxide-induced neurotoxicity and acts as a neurotrophic factor. The present study examines the effect of T-817MA on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in C57BL/6J mice. MPTP treatment (10mg/kg, s.c.x4 at 2-h intervals) impaired rotarod performance, and T-817MA improved this deficit. MPTP treatment also decreased dopamine levels and tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining in the substantia nigra (SNc) and striatum. Pretreatment with T-817MA (10 and 30mg/kg as T-817, p.o.) attenuated these decreases in dopamine levels and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, but did not affect brain levels of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion, an active metabolite of MPTP. The protective effect was almost complete in the SNc, but only partial in the striatum. MPTP increased levels of the lipid peroxidation product, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, only in the midbrain, which could be blocked by T-817MA. MPTP caused microglial activation both in the SNc and striatum, but T-817MA did not affect the activation of microglia. These results suggest that T-817MA protects against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity by blocking lipid peroxidation in the SNc, and imply that this compound may be useful for treating neurodegenerative disorders related to oxidative stress, such as Parkinson's disease.
To evaluate common genetic variations for association with symptomatic improvement in bipolar I depression following treatment with olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) or lamotrigine.
Symptom improvement was assessed in 88 OFC-treated and 85 lamotrigine-treated white patients with bipolar I depression in the 7-week acute period of a randomized, double-blind study comparing OFC (6/25, 6/50, 12/25, or 12/50 mg/d [olanzapine/fluoxetine]) with lamotrigine (titrated to 200 mg/d). The original study was conducted from November 2003 to August 2004. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in a set of 19 candidate genes corresponding to known sites of activity for olanzapine and fluoxetine or previously associated with antidepressant or antipsychotic response. Primary outcome was the reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score as assessed by the difference by genotype from baseline to week 7 from a mixed-effects repeated measures analysis with terms for visit, genotype, genotype-by-visit interaction, and baseline MADRS score as a covariate.
SNPs within the dopamine D(3) receptor and histamine H(1) receptor (HRH1) genes were significantly associated with response to OFC. SNPs within the dopamine D(2) receptor, HRH1, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, glucocorticoid receptor, and melanocortin 2 receptor genes were significantly associated with response to lamotrigine.
SNPs in specific candidate genes were associated with symptomatic improvement in a treatment-specific fashion. These results suggest the importance of dopaminergic effects in the treatment of patients with bipolar I depression and the potential utility of genotyping in selection of pharmacologic treatments for bipolar depression.
Previous reports have suggested that nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's disease (NLPHD) is a germinal center-derived B-cell lymphoma that is distinct from other types of Hodgkin's Disease. A relationship between NLPHD and simultaneous or subsequent development of large-cell (LC) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has been established. Both Reed-Sternberg cell variants in NLPHD and NHL cells in these cases express B-cell-associated antigens, and in some cases the B-cell lineage of the NHL has been confirmed by immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies. The B-cell phenotype and the indolent course of both lymphomas suggest histologic progression of NLPHD to B-cell NHL, rather than a de novo LCNHL unrelated to Hodgkin's Disease. We report a unique case of T-large-cell lymphoma (TLCL) following successful chemotherapy of NLPHD. A 54-year-old male was treated with seven cycles of mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone chemotherapy for NLPHD and 4 years later developed recurrent adenopathy. Lymph node biopsy showed a diffuse LCNHL. Frozen section immunotyping and gene rearrangement studies confirmed the diagnosis of TLCL. To our knowledge, this case represents only the second report of TLCL associated with NLPHD and is of significance in that: (1) it demonstrates that T-cell neoplasia can occur in the setting of NLPHD; (2) this case does not appear to represent histologic progression of NLPHD and most likely represents de novo disease that may be secondary to chemotherapy; and (3) the clinical course may differ from the favorable prognosis seen in NLPHD associated with B-cell NHL.
To characterize sleep disorders in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients, we evaluated sleep quality of 101 non-selective patients from our MMT clinic in Israel between July, 2003 and July, 2004 by using the self-report questionnaire Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Patients' urine tests were analyzed for methadone metabolite, opiates, benzodiazepine, cocaine, cannabis and amphetamines. Their urine results for drug abuse throughout the months prior to filling in the questionnaire and their maintenance methadone doses were recorded. Drug abuse was defined by at least one positive urine test. Methadone serum levels were available in 55 patients, assessed by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy. The patients' self-reported chronic pain questionnaires and their diagnosed psychiatric disorders were analyzed. Out of the 101 study patients, 78.2% were male, 52.5% had psychiatric disorders, 46.5% reported having chronic pain and 46.5% had positive urine for benzodiazepine. The mean daily methadone dose was 157+/-52.9 mg. The mean PSQI score was 9+/-4.8 (75.2% had scores >5 indicating "poor sleepers"). PSQI scores were higher in patients with positive urine for benzodiazepine, chronic pain and psychiatric disorders and they correlated with years of opiate abuse before admission to MMT, and with the methadone dose (r=0.48, p<0.0005). The latter two also correlated with each other. The PSQI was not correlated with duration in MMT, gender, age, abuse of opiates, cannabis or cocaine. We concluded that sleep disorders should be evaluated and treated among MMT patients, particularly in those with psychiatric disorders, benzodiazepine abuse, chronic pain and high methadone dose.
Myalgia is the most frequently reported adverse side effect associated with statin therapy and often necessitates reduction in dose, or the cessation of therapy, compromising cardiovascular risk management. One postulated mechanism for statin-related myalgia is mitochondrial dysfunction through the depletion of coenzyme Q(10), a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This pilot study evaluated the effect of coenzyme Q(10) supplementation on statin tolerance and myalgia in patients with previous statin-related myalgia. Forty-four patients were randomized to coenzyme Q(10) (200 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks in combination with upward dose titration of simvastatin from 10 mg/day, doubling every 4 weeks if tolerated to a maximum of 40 mg/day. Patients experiencing significant myalgia reduced their statin dose or discontinued treatment. Myalgia was assessed using a visual analogue scale. There was no difference between combined therapy and statin alone in the myalgia score change (median 6.0 [interquartile range 2.1 to 8.8] vs 2.3 [0 to 12.8], p = 0.63), in the number of patients tolerating simvastatin 40 mg/day (16 of 22 [73%] with coenzyme Q(10) vs 13 of 22 [59%] with placebo, p = 0.34), or in the number of patients remaining on therapy (16 of 22 [73%] with coenzyme Q(10) vs 18 of 22 [82%] with placebo, p = 0.47). In conclusion, coenzyme Q(10) supplementation did not improve statin tolerance or myalgia, although further studies are warranted.
