Acute pulmonary hypertension is a severe and life-threatening reaction that rarely occurs secondary to protamine administration. Management of systemic hypotension combined with severe pulmonary hypertension causing right ventricular failure is challenging. We describe a case of acute pulmonary hypertension induced by protamine during elective coronary artery bypass surgery refractory to multiple systemic inotropic and vasopressor therapies. After inhaled prostacyclin administration, our patient's pulmonary artery pressures decreased from 70/37 to 45/23 mm Hg within 10 min. The case highlights a role for inhaled nebulized prostacyclin as a selective pulmonary vasodilator with minimal systemic hypotensive effects.
Pharmacogenetics can be used as a tool for stratified pharmacological therapy in cardiovascular medicine. We investigated whether a predefined combination of the Arg389Gly polymorphism in the adrenergic β(1) -receptor gene (ADRB1) and the Gln27Glu polymorphism in the adrenergic β(2) -receptor gene (ADRB2) could predict survival in carvedilol- and metoprolol-treated chronic heart failure (HF) patients.
Five hundred and eighty-six HF patients (carvedilol n= 82, metoprolol n= 195) were genotyped for ADRB1 Arg389Gly (rs1801253) and ADRB2 Gln27Glu (rs1042714). The end-point was all-cause mortality, and median follow-up time was 6.7 years. Patients were classified into two functional genotype groups: group 1 combination of Arg389-homozygous and Gln27-carrier (46%) and group 2 any other genotype combination (54%). Results were fitted in two multivariate Cox models.
There was a significant interaction between functional genotype group and carvedilol treatment (adjusted(1) P= 0.033, adjusted(2) P= 0.040). Patients treated with carvedilol had shorter survival in functional genotype group 1 (P= 0.004; adjusted(1) hazard ratio (HR) 2.67, 95% CI 1.27, 5.59, P= 0.010; adjusted(2) HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06, 3.95, P= 0.033). There was no interaction between genotype group and metoprolol treatment (P= 0.61), and there was no difference in overall survival between genotype groups (P= 0.69).
A combination of ADRB1 Arg389-homozygous and ADRB2 Gln27-carrier in HF patients treated with carvedilol was associated with a two-fold increase in mortality relative to all other genotype combinations. There was no difference in survival in metoprolol-treated HF patients between genotype groups. Patients in genotype group 1 may benefit more from metoprolol than carvedilol treatment.
Several studies have indicated increased expression of the Ras protooncogenes in liver cirrhosis. In a previous study in rats, we have shown that a synthetic Ras antagonist, S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), could inhibit the development of liver cirrhosis. The aim of the current study was to examine whether FTS will accelerate the resolution of liver cirrhosis induced in rats by thioacetamide.
Cirrhosis was induced in male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of thioacetamide (200 mg/kg twice weekly for 12 weeks). In the treated group, the Ras antagonist FTS (5 mg/kg, i.p./3 times/week) was administered for 8 weeks after liver cirrhosis has already been established. Control cirrhotic rats received PBS injections for 8 weeks.
Rats treated with FTS for 8 weeks had lower histopathologic score of fibrosis (P = 0.01), lower hepatic hydroxyproline levels (P = 0.0002) and lower spleen weight (P = 0.02) than the cirrhotic rats treated with PBS. Following FTS treatment, the MMP-2 and MMP-9-induced collagenolytic activity and TIMP-2 expression, were increased in FTS-compared to PBS-treated rats. TUNEL assay of liver sections performed 8 weeks after thioacetamide withdrawal showed increased apoptotic figures in both groups (P = NS).
These results indicate that the Ras antagonist FTS accelerates the regression of experimentally-induced hepatic cirrhosis. The mechanism may involve increased collagenolytic activity.
4 racehorses were examined because of markedly abnormal behavior following administration of fluphenazine decanoate.
Clinical signs included restlessness, agitation, profuse sweating, hypermetria, aimless circling, intense pawing and striking with the thoracic limbs, and rhythmic swinging of the head and neck alternating with episodes of severe stupor. Fluphenazine was detected in serum or plasma from all 4 horses. The dose of fluphenazine decanoate administered to 3 of the 4 horses was within the range (25 to 50 mg) routinely administered to adult humans.
In 2 horses, there was no response to IV administration of diphenhydramine hydrochloride, but the abnormal behavior in these 2 horses appeared to resolve following administration of benztropine mesylate, and both horses returned to racing. The other 2 horses responded to diphenhydramine administration. One returned to racing. The other was euthanized because of severe neurologic signs, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.
Findings indicate that adverse extrapyramidal effects may occur in horses given fluphenazine decanoate. These effects appear to be unpredictable and may be severe and life threatening. Use of fluphenazine decanoate as an anxiolytic in performance horses is not permitted in many racing and horse show jurisdictions, and analytic procedures are now available to detect the presence of fluphenazine in serum or plasma.
Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is caused by del(17)(p11.2), including the retinoic acid induced 1 gene (RAI1), or mutation of RAI1. Haploinsufficiency of RAI1 results in developmental delay, mental retardation, sleep disturbance, self-abusive behaviors, and most features commonly seen in SMS. In this study, 52 subjects were referred for molecular analysis of RAI1 due to the presence of an SMS-like phenotype in each case. For this cohort, deletion and mutation analyses of RAI1 were negative; thus, the clinical diagnosis of SMS could not be confirmed and suggested that at least one other locus was responsible for the phenotype(s) observed.
Here, we present whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization and detailed phenotypic data of these 52 subjects.
This SMS-like cohort exhibited developmental delays, sleep disturbance, self-abusive behaviors, motor dysfunction, and hyperactivity of the same type and prevalence as that of SMS. In this analysis, we identified at least 5 new loci that likely contribute to the SMS-like phenotype, including CNVs that were found in more than one subject. Genes in these regions function in development, neurological integrity, and morphology, all of which are affected in SMS.
Given the phenotypic overlap between SMS and the SMS-like cases, these data may provide some insight into the function of RAI1, including the pathways in which it may be involved and the genes it may regulate. These data will improve diagnosis, understanding, and potentially treatment of these complex behavior and mental retardation syndromes.
Treatment for 2 h with 200 microM cadmium chloride, followed by recovery, caused apoptosis and induced heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression in U-937 promonocytic cells. However, pre-incubation with the GSH depleting agent L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO, 1 mM for 24 h) caused necrosis instead of apoptosis and failed to induce HSP70 expression. This failure was a consequence of necrosis instead of GSH depletion, since BSO allowed or even potentiated HSP70 induction when used in combination with heat shock (2 h at 42.5 degrees C) or with 50 microM cadmium, which caused apoptosis. The administration of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) at the beginning of recovery after BSO/200 microM cadmium treatment prevented the execution of necrosis and restored the execution of apoptosis, but did not restore HSP70 induction, indicating that the inhibition by BSO of HSP70 expression is an early regulated event. This contrasted with the capacity of NAC to prevent the alterations caused by BSO/200 microM cadmium in other proteins, namely the suppression of Bax expression and the increase in Bcl-2 and HSP-60 expression. Finally, it was observed that treatment with 200 microM cadmium rapidly increased the HSP70 mRNA level and stimulated heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1) trimerization and binding, and that these effects were prevented by pre-incubation with BSO. Taken together, these results indicate that the stress response is compatible with apoptosis but not with necrosis in cadmium-treated promonocytic cells. The suppression of the stress response is specifically due to the early inhibition of HSF1 activation.
Hemorrhagic shock causes severe depression of macrophage functions and is associated with increased susceptibility to sepsis. Because hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation encompasses several pathophysiological conditions, such as hypotension, low-flow conditions, hypoxia, and reperfusion injury, it remains unknown whether severe hypotension in the absence of blood loss has any adverse effects on macrophage functions. To study this, systemic arterial hypotension was induced in C3H/HeN mice for 15 min by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside or ATP-MgCl2. Peritoneal macrophages (PM) was harvested 20 h later with lavage. Antigen presentation was measured by coculturing PM with the D10.G4.1 Th cell clone. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, and prostaglandin (PG) E2 levels in supernatants of PM stimulated with lipopolysaccharide were measured with bioassays or radioimmunoassay. Systemic arterial hypotension resulted in a significant decrease of PM capacity to present antigen. Although the release of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1 by PM was unaltered after hypotension, PGE2 release by PM was significantly elevated compared with the control group. These data indicate that chemically induced systemic arterial hypotension without blood loss leads to a depression of antigen presentation, which may be caused by elevated release of the immunosuppressive eicosanoid PGE2.
We studied the effect of Inchin-ko-to (TJ-135), a herb medicine that has been clinically used for liver cirrhosis in Japan, on liver fibrosis in a rat model and on the function of stellate cells.
Rat liver fibrosis was generated by thioacetamide (TAA) administration. DNA synthesis was assessed by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay. Protein expression was analysed by western blotting. Collagen and fibronectin mRNA expression were analysed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
TJ-135 improved liver fibrosis induced in rats by TAA administration. TJ-135 reduced collagen deposition and the expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin in fibrotic liver tissues and decreased the serum level of hyaluronic acid. In primary-cultured stellate cells, TJ-135 suppressed DNA synthesis and the expression of collagen alpha 1(I), collagen III, and fibronectin mRNAs. It hampered DNA synthesis and migration of PDGF-BB-stimulated stellate cells through inhibiting phosphorylation of PDGF receptor-beta and down-stream signaling pathways. Among TJ-135 components, 3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone (emodin) derived from Rhei rhizoma was found to be the most active molecule.
TJ-135 and emodin regulate PDGF-dependent events in stellate cells and attenuate the development of liver fibrosis. Their clinical use may be beneficial for the therapy of human liver fibrosis.
A secondary end point of the NBL90 protocol (Rubie H et al. Pediatr Oncol 2001;36:247-250) was the concern in this infant population for possible carboplatin-(CBDCA) induced late side effects including impaired renal and hearing functions.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), tubular function (TF), pure tone audiometry (PTA), high-frequency, and transient evoked-otoacoustic emission were prospectively assessed in 30 children alive and disease-free 6 years after the end of the treatment.
Median age at diagnosis and at assessment was 4.7 months and 7 years, respectively. Blood pressure was < or =97.5 centile in all children. The mean estimated GFR was 114 +/- 13 ml/min/1.73 m(2) by Schwartz formula [range 87-145]. TF assessment failed to demonstrate any impairment. 29/30 children had grade 0 ototoxicity and all transient evoked otoacoustic emission were normal.
With a 6-year follow-up the combination of VP16 and carboplatin given at conventional doses is safe on renal and hearing functions in infants with unresectable neuroblastomas treated according to SFOP NB90.
A 2-year-old child, non immunodeficient, presented with septicemia due to Kingella kingae successively complicated by meningitis, arthritis of one knee and endocarditis. Outcome was favourable after a long and adjusted antibiotherapy, involving in particular for the endocarditis ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/d) and amikacin (20 mg/kg/d) during 3 weeks, then amoxicillin per os (200 mg/kg/d) during 3 weeks.
Bacteriologic characteristics of the bacteria, the culture of which requires medium base with additional nutrient are reviewed. The tropism of Kingella kingae is essentially osteoarticular and cardiac as shown by the cases reported in the literature. Its susceptibility to antibiotics explains the frequent favourable outcome.
The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat, which accumulates excess copper (Cu) in its liver, is an animal model of Wilson's disease. We evaluated and compared the distributions of Cu, ferrous (Fe2+), and ferric (Fe3+) iron in four-brain regions, namely, in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, substantia nigra (SN), and striatum of LEC and Long-Evans Agouti rats at 30 and 55 weeks. Cu levels were elevated in the striatum of LEC rats, and Fe2+ and Fe3+ were higher in the striatum and SN of LEC rats. Ratios of Fe2+ to Fe3+ were > 1 in four regions, and were highest in the striatum and SN of LEC rats. Cu and iron levels were found to be augmented during aging, and we suggest that these accumulations may exert deleterious effects in aged LEC rats. This study is the first report that demonstrates regional differences of Fe2+ and Fe3+ accumulation in the brain of aged LEC rats. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms of Cu and iron accumulations and of their effects.
One hundred forty-one patients with advanced breast cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 or epirubicin 90 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. These doses were selected to produce equivalent toxicities. All patients were assessed for toxicity, and 138 patients were assessable for response. After a median of five treatment cycles, 47% (32 of 68) of doxorubicin-treated patients achieved a partial or complete response. Response duration and survival were 10 and 12 months for doxorubicin and 8 and 10 months for epirubicin, respectively. Noncardiac toxicities were similar for both drugs. Of 41 patients receiving doxorubicin who had serial left ventricular ejection fraction assessments, seven sustained a fall of 10% or more, and one patient developed congestive cardiac failure at a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 489 mg/m2. Of 39 patients receiving epirubicin who had serial cardiac assessments, five sustained left ventricular ejection fraction falls of 10% or more and two patients developed congestive cardiac failure at cumulative doses of 178 mg/m2 and 833 mg/m2. These data indicate that an epirubicin dose of 90 mg/m2 produces toxicity equivalent to doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 but does not improve response rates, response duration, or survival in advanced breast cancer.
Nitrosylation of tyrosine (3-nitro tyrosine, 3-NT) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various disorders particularly neurodegenerative conditions and aging. Cyperus rotundus rhizome is being used as a traditional folk medicine to alleviate a variety of disorders including neuronal stress. The herb has recently found applications in food and confectionary industries also. In current study, we have explored the protective effects of C. rotundus rhizome extract (CRE) through its oxido-nitrosative and anti apoptotic mechanism to attenuate peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) induced neurotoxicity using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Our results elucidate that pre-treatment of neurons with CRE ameliorates the mitochondrial and plasma membrane damage induced by 500 μM SIN-1 to 80% and 24% as evidenced by MTT and LDH assays. CRE inhibited NO generation by downregulating i-NOS expression. SIN-1 induced depletion of antioxidant enzyme status was also replenished by CRE which was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of SOD and CAT. The CRE pre-treatment efficiently potentiated the SIN-1 induced apoptotic biomarkers such as bcl-2 and caspase-3 which orchestrate the proteolytic damage of the cell. The ONOO(-) induced damage to cellular, nuclear and mitochondrial integrity was also restored by CRE. Furthermore, CRE pre-treatment also regulated the 3-NT formation which shows the potential of plant extract against tyrosine nitration. Taken together, our findings suggest that CRE might be developed as a preventive agent against ONOO(-) induced apoptosis.
Our purpose was to report our experience with four patients with renal colic who had a rare unilateral complication from urographic contrast media, with a dense and striated nephrogram affecting only the healthy kidney. All cases were reversible.
An unusual complication of urography with a characteristic radiologic appearance is presented. This complication was transient and reversible in our patients. Unilateral tubular blockage induced by a contrast agent must be considered when the contralateral kidney shows evidence of ureteral obstruction.
To improve current adjuvant results in high-risk breast cancer, in February 1982 we activated a prospective randomized trial using both intravenous cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) and Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Farmitalia-Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) involving patients with resectable mammary carcinoma and more than three positive axillary lymph nodes. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of four courses of Adriamycin followed by eight courses of CMF versus two courses of CMF alternated with one course of Adriamycin for a total of 12 courses. All drug courses were recycled every 3 weeks. Rather than temporarily reducing doses in the event of myelosuppression on the planned day of treatment, drug administration was delayed for 1 to 2 weeks. At a median follow-up of 59 months, treatment outcome was significantly superior for patients who received Adriamycin followed by CMF (Adriamycin----CMF) than for those given alternating regimens (CMF/Adriamycin). The 5-year relapse-free survival was superior post-Adriamycin----CMF (61%) compared with post-CMF/Adriamycin administration (38%; P = .001). The corresponding figures for the 5-year total survival were 78% and 62%, respectively (P = .005). The benefit of Adriamycin----CMF was observed in all patient subsets. Treatment was fairly well tolerated, and we documented only one case of fatal congestive heart failure in a patient who received postoperative irradiation to the left breast in addition to Adriamycin. Present findings indicate that in women with extensive nodal involvement, Adriamycin----CMF yielded superior results compared with CMF/Adriamycin.
Cocaine abuse is associated with a variety of severe acute neurologic complications. These include ischemic stroke, subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage, syncope, seizures, and death. Eleven adult patients with cocaine-related seizures are reported. All were seen during the 1987 calendar year at the King/Drew Medical Center and Urban Comprehensive Epilepsy Program of Los Angeles. Three apparent clinical circumstances with defined methods of intake and time course after usage were identified in our cases. Seizures occurred 1) as acute provoked convulsions in patients known to have epilepsy, 2) spontaneously in otherwise normal individuals after acute snorting or "crack smoking," and 3) agonally with massive ingestion.
To evaluate the safety of reduced-dosage ketoprofen (RDKET) for long-term oral administration in healthy dogs.
14 healthy Beagles.
Racemic ketoprofen (0.25 mg/kg, PO) and gelatin capsules, as a drug-free placebo, were each administered to 7 dogs for 30 days. Dogs were periodically monitored via physical examination, blood analyses, endoscopic examinations, fecal occult blood tests (tetramethylbenzidine and guaiac methods), renal function tests (effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate), urinalyses, urinary enzyme indices (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and gamma-glutamyl-transferase), and hemostatic function tests (buccal mucosa bleeding time, cuticle bleeding time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen concentration).
Pyloric antrum lesion grade was significantly higher in the RDKET group on day 28, compared with the pretreatment and control group grades. Fecal occult blood grade measured by use of the tetramethylbenzidine method was significantly higher in the RDKET group on day 30, compared with the pretreatment grade. No other significant differences were detected between treatment groups.
RDKET induced mild to moderate gastric mucosal injuries especially in the pyloric antrum in healthy Beagles, whereas no adverse effects were observed in renal function or hemostasis. Fecal occult blood tests may be useful as screening tests for adverse gastrointestinal effects induced by RDKET in dogs.
To investigate, over a wide range of cumulative doxorubicin doses, the feasibility of using serum concentrations of cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) as a biomarker for doxorubicin-induced myocardial damage.
Groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were given 1 mg/kg doxorubicin weekly for 2 to 12 weeks. Cardiomyopathy scores were assessed according to the method of Billingham and serum levels of cTnT were quantified by a noncompetitive immunoassay. Myocardial localization of cTnT was studied by immunohistochemical staining and confocal microscopy.
Increases in serum levels of cTnT (0.03 to 0.05 ng/mL) and myocardial lesions (cardiomyopathy scores of 1 or 1.5) were found in one out of five and two out of five SHR given 2 and 4 mg/kg doxorubicin, respectively. All animals given 6 mg/kg or more of doxorubicin had increases in serum cTnT and myocardial lesions. The average cTnT levels and the cardiomyopathy scores correlated with the cumulative dose of doxorubicin (0.13 v 0.4 ng/mL cTnT and scores of 1.4 v 3.0 in SHR given 6 and 12 mg/kg doxorubicin, respectively). Decreased staining for cTnT was observed in cardiac tissue from SHR receiving cumulative doses that caused only minimal histologic alterations (scores of 1 to 1.5). Staining for cTnT decreased simultaneously with increases in the severity of the cardiomyopathy scores.
cTnT is released from doxorubicin-damaged myocytes. Measurements of serum levels of this protein seem to provide a sensitive means for assessing the early cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin.
To assess the effect of urokinase-induced reduction of fibrinogen concentration on myocardial perfusion, urokinase infusions were administered for 3 months to 24 men (mean age 59 +/- 10 years) in the inoperable end-stage of coronary heart disease with treatment-resistant angina pectoris. Initially 500,000 IU urokinase were infused i.v. daily until a fibrinogen concentration of 150-200 mg/dl was reached. Treatment was then continued as out-patients at a dosage of 500,000 IU two to four times per week. After 12 weeks the fibrinogen concentration had fallen from 348 +/- 88 to 211 +/- 52 mg/dl and plasma viscosity from 1.44 +/- 0.08 to 1.33 +/- 0.09 mPa.s (P for each less than 0.01). Up to the end of 12 weeks after the end of treatment the frequency of anginal attacks fell significantly from 3.2 +/- 1.6 to 0.7 +/- 0.4 daily (P less than 0.01), while ergometric exercise capacity increased by 76%. Thallium myocardial scintigraphy demonstrated an increased perfusion in all but three of 19 patients, global in 10, regional in 6. These results indicate that in patients with treatment-resistant angina due to coronary heart disease chronic intermittent urokinase infusion provides a promising treatment alternative.
Three cases of tonic-clonic seizures following therapeutic doses of chloroquine for malaria are presented. A casual relationship between seizures and chloroquine therapy is suggested. There have been no previous reports of this adverse effect of chloroquine therapy in patients normally resident in a holoendemic area for malaria.
Biotinidase, an enzyme that is synthesized by the liver and secreted into the blood, decreases in plasma in both humans and experimental animal liver cirrhosis. In overdose conditions, paracetamol is known to cause centrilobular necrosis in both humans and experimental animals. We determined if there is any alteration in the activity of the enzyme in the plasma and liver of rats after subtoxic and toxic doses of paracetamol.
After 4-, 24-, and 40-h treatment of rats with either subtoxic (350 mg/kg body wt) or toxic dose (1000 mg per kg) of paracetamol intraperitoneally, biotinidase activity was assayed in the liver and plasma along with the albumin concentration and ALT activity.
After the subtoxic dose of paracetamol, there were no significant change in plasma biotinidase activity and liver biotinidase activity was observed at any time period after treatment. However, 24 and 40 h after the toxic dose of paracetamol, biotinidase activity was decreased in the liver and increased in the plasma as compared with the control, when plasma ALT was increased.
The increase in plasma biotinidase activity may serve as an indicator of paracetamol-induced acute liver injury in the rat.
Multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs; symbol ABCC) are membrane glycoproteins that mediate the ATP-dependent export of a wide range of substrates from cells and thereby affect the bioavailability and disposition of many drugs. MRP2 (ABCC2) is expressed on the apical domain of hepatocytes, enterocytes of the proximal small intestine, and proximal renal tubular cells, but its location in the brain is a matter of debate. Most previous studies failed to determine MRP2 mRNA or protein in the brain or cell preparations from the brain of different species including humans. Based on our previous experience with the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, we evaluated whether the immunohistochemical determination of MRP2 expression is sensitive to fixation and staining variables. Furthermore, we examined whether the MRP2 protein is overexpressed after experimentally induced seizures in rats, using the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The MRP2 expression in the liver was used as positive control. MRP2 deficient TR- rats were used as negative controls. Despite various modifications in tissue fixation and immunohistochemical staining as well as use of different commercially available MRP2 antibodies, we never observed any unequivocal MRP2 staining in the brain of normal rats. However, after a pilocarpine-induced convulsive status epilepticus, clear MRP2 staining became visible in brain capillary endothelial cells and, less frequently, perivascular astroglia and neurons in various brain regions. In view of our recent data on brain access of antiepileptic drugs in MRP2 deficient TR- rats, seizure-induced over-expression of MRP2 in the blood-brain barrier is likely to impair drug penetration into the brain, thereby contributing to drug resistance in epilepsy.
Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is given for acute ischemic stroke using a weight-based dosing regimen, and potential medication dosing errors may impact the relative risks and benefits of this therapy. Weight is frequently estimated by the patient, the family, the nurse, or the treating physician. Discrepancies between actual and estimated weight result in an incorrect dose, but errors of this type have not been previously studied in clinical practice. We hypothesized that such errors may impact the risks and benefits of rt-PA for stroke. The Multicenter rt-PA Acute Stroke Survey included data on 1205 acute stroke patients treated in routine clinical practice with intravenous rt-PA. We calculated the actual unit dose (in mg/kg) by dividing the dose of rt-PA given by the actual weight, and correlated this with risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and likelihood of good recovery (modified Rankin score of 0 or 1). Seven hundred and sixty-nine patients (64%) had data on both weight and rt-PA dosage. Forty-one patients (5.4%) had a symptomatic hemorrhage while 51 (6.6%) had an asymptomatic hemorrhage. There were non-significant trends towards increased risk of any ICH as the degree of overdosage increased, particularly in the highest dose quintile compared to the four lower quintiles (15.8% v 11.0%, P = .097). Adjustment for age, baseline NIHSS, and major early computed tomography (CT) changes strengthened this association (16.5% v 9.3%; P = .025). There was no association between actual dose and likelihood of good recovery (P = .57). Overdosage of rt-PA cause by an overestimation of weight resulted in a modest increase in the risk of ICH in the highest quintile, but there did not appear to be any reduction in effectiveness caused by underdosing. Every effort should be made to obtain the most accurate weight.
Systemic corticosteroid therapy is the usual treatment for hemangioma with vascular risk. Tolerance to such treatment is usually good.
A two Month-old girl presented with a hemangioma of the lower right eyelid that had developed since she was 15 days old. Treatment with betamethasone at the dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day was prescribed because of the risk of alteration in sight. The treatment was highly effective. The discovery of a systolic cardiac murmur motivated a cardiac sonography that showed signs of an obstructive hypertrophic myocardiopathy. The progressive reduction of the corticosteroids led to the regression of this disease.
The onset of a cardiomyopathy during systemic corticosteroid therapy has only been reported exceptionally in the literature. There is little known of the risks. When in doubt, clinical and sonographic monitoring is probably necessary. In the case of the appearance of a cardiac murmur, the sonography is crucial.
