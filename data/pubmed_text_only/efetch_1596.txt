Apoptosis contributes to tubular cell loss in the course of renal injury. However, the mechanisms regulating tubular cell apoptosis are not well understood. Smac/Diablo is a mitochondrial protein that is released to the cytosol during apoptosis, where it blocks the antiapoptotic activity of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs).
We have studied the regulation of Smac/Diablo mRNA and protein expression in murine toxic acute tubular necrosis, and in cultured tubular epithelial cells exposed to the lethal cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF).
Folic acid-induced acute renal failure was associated with tubular cell apoptosis. Smac/Diablo mRNA and protein levels increased by 50% at 24 hours. TNF, a cytokine whose renal expression increases in folic acid nephropathy, induced apoptosis in cultured tubular epithelial cells in a time-dependent manner. In addition, TNF increased the mRNA and protein expression of Smac/Diablo.
These findings support the concept that regulation of Smac/Diablo mRNA and protein expression is a mechanism by which lethal stimuli amplify their lethal potential in renal cells.
Activation of the renin angiotensin system has been described in pathologic conditions, including kidney damage. Angiotensin II (Ang II) acts through two receptors, AT1 and AT2. Most of the known actions of Ang II, including vasoconstriction and fibrosis, are due to AT1 activation. Recent data suggest that AT2 participates in the regulation of cell growth and renal inflammatory infiltration. Therefore, we investigated the renal expression of AT2 receptors in several models of renal injury.
Investigations were done in the following experimental models of kidney damage: systemic infusion of Ang II (inflammation), folic acid nephropathy (tubular cell death), and protein overload proteinuria. AT2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry (protein) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (gene).
In control animals, low levels of renal expression of AT2 were found. Ang II infusion resulted in an up-regulation of AT2 in tubular cells and de novo AT2 expression in glomeruli and vessels, associated with the presence of inflammatory cells. Acute tubular injury induced by folic acid was characterized by AT2 overexpression and apoptosis in tubular cells. Protein overload caused heavy proteinuria and tubular AT2 up-regulation.
AT2 is re-expressed in pathologic conditions of kidney damage, such as inflammation, apoptosis, and proteinuria, suggesting a potential role of this receptor during renal injury.
Triptolide (TP), a major component of TWHF, is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, nephritis and leprosy. However, its clinical use is limited by hepatotoxicity. To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of its hepatotoxic effects, hepatic gene expression profiles were analyzed. TP (1000 and 300 μg/kg) was orally administered to Wistar rats for 14 days. Current study indicated that female rats were more sensitive to TP-induced hepatotoxicity than males. Genome-wide microarray analyses identified 3329 differentially expressed genes in liver of female rats. Analyses of these genes identified over-represented functions associated with insulin signaling pathway, glucose metabolism, cell cycle, oxidative stress and apoptosis, which were consistent with the results of significant increase of Caspase-3 activity and reduction of serum glucose, GSH/GSSG ratio, glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities, liver glycogen. In addition, it was observed for the first time that glucocorticoids and IGF1 might get involved in TP-induced hepatotoxicity. These data suggest that TP treatment could alter the hepatic redox status, reduce serum glucose and induce hepatocyte apoptosis, consistent with the differential expression of genes involved in insulin signaling pathway, glucose metabolism pathway and cell stress pathway, all of which might contribute to the overall TP-induced hepatotoxicity.
Levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the long-term use of this dopamine precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and dyskinesias. Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying levodopa-induced dyskinesias, their pathogenesis is still unclear. In recent years, evidence from animal models of Parkinson's disease has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post-receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of dyskinetic movements. Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms, dopamine receptor subtypes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias.
We report the case of normoaldosterone spironolactone sensitive hypertension. Patients suffering from this recently identified form of arterial hypertension exhibit clinical symptoms resembling the symptoms of primary aldosteronism. The described disturbances may be misdiagnosed as essential hypertension because plasma aldosterone levels and aldosterone/renin ratio in patients are within the normal ranges. In the described state of the examined female, detection of the disease and implementation of spironolactone treatment not only normalised arterial blood pressure but also allowed to avoid unnecessary administration of many antihypertensive agents.
Abnormal calcium transport may be implicated in the membrane defect in myotonic dystrophy. A single blind crossover trial of placebo (t.i.d.), nifedipine 10 mg (t.i.d.) and nifedipine 20 mg (t.i.d.), was performed in 10 patients with myotonic dystrophy. The severity of myotonia was assessed by measuring finger extension time after maximum voluntary finger flexion. A significant improvement in myotonia, after nifedipine, was recorded by this technique and supported by a subjective improvement in 50% of patients and clinical improvement of greater than 20% in five patients. Initial grip strength and muscle fatiguability measured by grip strength ergometry were not significantly altered.
PURPOSE To evaluate long-term cardiac function in patients without disease who had received six cycles of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC 50) or the same regimen with epirubicin 100 mg/m(2) (FEC 100) as adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive breast cancer in the French Adjuvant Study Group-05 trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred fifty patients (FEC 50, n = 65; FEC 100, n = 85) who were without disease and who gave their informed consent were enrolled for long-term cardiac assessment. The assessment included cardiac events occurring after the end of chemotherapy, vital signs, concomitant disease, ECG, isotopic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and echographic parameters. Abnormal files were blindly reviewed by cardiologists and oncologists. Results The median follow-up time was 102 months. After FEC 100, LVEF was less than 50% in five patients (radioisotopic method), and two patients experienced congestive heart failure (CHF) that was possibly related to treatment. Asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) was experienced in 18 patients after FEC 100 and in one patient after FEC 50. In these patients, treatment causality was probable in eight patients. Two additional years after this assessment, all 18 patients were still asymptomatic. CONCLUSION After more than 8 years of follow-up, the cardiac toxicity observed after adjuvant treatment with FEC 100 comprised two cases of well-controlled CHF and 18 cases of asymptomatic LVD. In the majority of women with primary breast cancer, the benefits of treatment with FEC 100 in terms of disease-free and overall survival outweigh the risks, and cardiac risk factors should be carefully evaluated in patient selection.
To assess the maternal, fetal and neonatal safety of enoxaparin in pregnant women who require antithrombotic therapy.
Retrospective analysis of case notes of women who received enoxaparin during pregnancy, irrespective of dose, duration and reason for treatment.
Fifty-five French perinatal centres.
Data from 624 pregnancies in 604 women between 1988 and 1997. The incidence of previous thromboembolism was 29.8%, known thrombophilia 15.2%.
Indication, regimen of enoxaparin and outcome measures were reported for each pregnancy. Information was obtained from case records, validated by research staff and analysed by an independent scientific committee.
Incidence, seriousness and causality of maternal, fetal and neonatal adverse events, pregnancy outcome, and incidence of venous thromboembolism.
Enoxaparin was administered for treatment of an acute episode in 49 cases and for thromboprophylaxis in 574 cases. Serious maternal haemorrhage occurred in 11 cases during pregnancy (1.8%), one being reasonably related to enoxaparin, and in nine cases at delivery (1.4%), all unrelated to enoxaparin. Maternal thrombocytopenia was reported in 10 cases (1.6%). two being serious but unrelated to enoxaparin. Eight pregnancies ended in stillbirth (1.1%). Among the 693 live births, 17 major congenital abnormalities (2.5%) and 10 serious neonatal haemorrhages (1.4%) were reported. None of the fetal or neonatal adverse events was related to enoxaparin. Eight venous thromboembolic events (1.3%) were reported.
The incidence of adverse events reported could be explained by the high risk profile of the study population. Overall, this retrospective study suggests enoxaparin is well tolerated during pregnancy.
Fluspirilene (Trademark Imap) is a depot neuroleptic agent for i.m. injection known for several years. Since it is well tolerated, has substance-specific repository properties and rarely leads to extrapyramidal motorial side effects, it has proved itself efficient for the in- and outpatient treatment of psychoses. Recently however, an extension of its indication has been advocated (as a "weak tranquilizer") to unspecific anxiety and agitation states as well as functional/neurasthenic syndromes. According to our observations, administration of the drug over several weeks in these cases frequently leads to depressive syndromes. Based on three case studies, this paper illustrates the problems involving administration of 1,5 mg Imap in functional/neurasthenic syndromes and discusses the occasional necessity of antidepressive therapy following discontinuation of the neuroleptic medication.
Drug-induced liver disease is due to intrinsic or idiosyncratic hepatotoxins. Liver parenchyma is then infiltrated by immunocompetent cells. Eosinophils are primarily tissue leukocytes which are attracted into tissues by various chemoattractants, including chemokines. The aim of this study was to study eosinophils in the livers of patients with drug-induced liver disease.
Immunohistochemical studies with antibodies against eosinophil cationic proteins (major basic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin and eosinophil cationic protein), cytokines (interleukin 5 (IL-5), interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)) and chemokines (eotaxin and RANTES (Regulated upon Activation Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted)) were performed to assess the in situ activation of the liver-infiltrating eosinophils of 14 patients with drug-induced liver disease and 19 controls.
Eosinophils were only observed in patients with drug-induced liver disease. Eosinophils were morphologically normal when hepatitis was due to paracetamol whereas eosinophils had granular changes when hepatitis was due to an idiosyncratic hepatotoxin. Eotaxin was detected in all patients with drug-induced liver disease, whereas RANTES was detected in three of them. IL-5, IL-3 or GM-CSF were not detected.
In patients with drug-induced liver disease, the recruitment of eosinophils in the liver may depend on eotaxin expression. Eosinophil changes may vary according to the type of drug.
Analyzing the CYP2A6 gene of subjects who showed a poor metabolic phenotype toward SM-12502, we discovered a novel mutant allele (CYP2A6*4C) lacking the whole CYP2A6 gene. Using genetically engineered Salmonella typhimurium expressing a human CYP, we found that CYP2A6 was involved in the metabolic activation of a variety of nitrosamines such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) contained in tobacco smoke. Taking these results into consideration, we hypothesized that the subjects carrying the CYP2A6*4C allele had lower risk of tobacco-related lung cancer. In accordance with our hypothesis, our epidemiological studies indicated that smokers homozygous for the CYP2A6*4C allele showed much lower odds ratios toward cancer risk. Other mutant alleles reducing the CYP2A6 activity, besides CYP2A6*4C, also reduced the risk of lung cancer in smokers, particularly of squamous-cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma, both smoking-related cancers. 8-Methoxypsoralen, an inhibitor of CYP2A6, efficiently prevented the occurrence of adenoma caused by NNK in A/J mice.
Amphetamine-group substances are used worldwide and are more prevalent than either cocaine or opioids. We reviewed published reports about amphetamine-group substances and did a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for their use. Most research was done in developed countries. Many, but not all, studies show an association between amphetamine-group substance use and risk of HIV infection. Much use of amphetamine-group substances is non-injection and is associated with increased HIV risk, particularly in men who have sex with men. The structural, social, interpersonal, and personal factors that link to amphetamine-group substance use and HIV risk are poorly understood. 13 studies, with a cumulative sample size of 1997 individuals, qualified for the meta-analysis. Overall, high-intensity behavioural interventions were moderately effective in reducing use of amphetamine-group substances (effect size 0.28, 95% CI 0.13-0.44). We did not find conclusive evidence that behavioural interventions as a group are more effective than are passive or minium treatment for reduction of amphetamine-group substance use or sexual risk behaviours. The search for effective, scalable, and sustainable interventions for amphetamine-group substance use, including pharmacotherapies, should be supported and encouraged.
Topical application of Iloprost caused a dose-dependent decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) in rabbits and ocular hypertensive beagles. In rabbits, the IOP response was biphasic and miosis was observed. In beagles, there was no initial hypertensive phase, and the fall in IOP was more pronounced (up to 37%). In beagles, Iloprost did not influence pupillary diameter. A mild transient hyperemia was noted in both rabbit and beagle eyes. Iloprost led to an increase in the aqueous humor protein concentration in rabbits but not in beagles. The use of artificial tears as vehicle enhanced the effect on intraocular pressure but also aqueous protein in rabbits. The central corneal temperature was increased after application of Iloprost in both rabbits and beagles. In rabbits, tonography revealed an increase in outflow facility during both the hypertensive and the hypotensive phases. Iloprost caused a decrease in mean arterial pressure in beagles; the effect on pulse rate was inconsequential. It is suggested that similar low doses of an analog of Iloprost or carboprostacyclin that does not affect the hemodynamic equilibrium could be of value in the treatment of glaucoma.
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells express promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARalpha) fusion protein, which leads to the blocking of APL cell differentiation. Treatment of APL with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces disease remission by in vivo differentiation of APL cells. Differentiation requires cell cycle exit; yet how ATRA couples cell cycle exit to differentiation of APL remains largely unknown. We previously found that ATRA-induced cell differentiation accompanies ubiquitination-proteolysis of ménage à trois 1 (MAT1), an assembly factor and targeting subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) that regulates G1 exit. We report here that CAK binds to and phosphorylates PML/RARalpha in actively proliferating APL cells. In response to ATRA, PML/RARalpha is dissociated from CAK, leading to MAT1 degradation, G1 arrest, and decreased CAK phosphorylation of PML/RARalpha. CAK phosphorylation of PML/RARalpha is inhibited when MAT1 levels are reduced. Both MAT1 degradation and PML/RARalpha hypophosphorylation occur in ATRA-induced G1-arresting cells undergoing differentiation but not in the synchronized G1 cells that do not differentiate. These findings reveal a novel ATRA signaling on APL cell differentiation, in which ATRA coordinates G1 arrest and transition into differentiation by inducing MAT1 degradation and PML/RARalpha hypophosphorylation through disrupting PML/RARalpha binding and phosphorylation by CAK.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of ionization and vehicle of topical formulations on skin absorption and penetration of azelaic acid (AZA).
In vitro transport of AZA was determined for two topical formulations containing AZA with pH values of 3.9 and 4.9, respectively. FINACEA(®) (15% AZA gel), a US Food and Drug Administration approved drug for treatment of acne and rosacea, was also used for comparison. Release profile and flux of AZA were determined in an in vitro hairless mouse skin model using Franz Diffusion Cell.
The data have shown that a higher concentration of AZA is retained in the epidermis/dermis layer and the whole skin for the formulation with pH = 4.9 as compared to that with pH = 3.9 at an active loading level of 2.82 mg/cm(2). In addition, the flux of ionized species of AZA in the pH 4.9 formulation (128.4 ± 35.9 μg/cm(2)/h) is approximately five-fold greater than that in the pH 3.9 formulation (27.7 ± 4.0 μg/cm(2)/h). The results suggest that the ionized AZA penetrates through the skin and accounts for majority of the total flux.
This study has demonstrated that the penetration and absorption of AZA show a strong pH- and vehicle-dependency. Solubilization is the rate-limiting step in percutaneous absorption of AZA.
Childhood-onset schizophrenia is a rare but severe form of the disorder that is often treatment-refractory. In this study, the efficacy and adverse effects of clozapine and haloperidol were compared for children and adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia.
Twenty-one patients (mean [+/-SD] age, 14.0 +/- 2.3 years) with onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition-defined schizophrenia that began by age 12 years and who had been nonresponsive to typical neuroleptics participated in the study. Patients were randomized to a 6-week double-blind parallel comparison of clozapine (mean [+/-SD] final dose, 176 +/- 149 mg/d), or haloperidol, (16 +/- 8 mg/d).
Clozapine was superior to haloperidol on all measures of psychosis (P = .04-.002). Positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia improved. However, neutropenia and seizures were major concerns. To date, one third of the group has discontinued using clozapine.
Clozapine has striking superiority for positive and negative symptoms in treatment-refractory childhood-onset schizophrenia. However, due to possibly increased toxic effects in this pediatric population, close monitoring for adverse events is essential.
Normal adult men and women have been infused with epinephrine, 6 mug per minute, during lipolytic blockade with nicotinic acid, beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol and Butoxamine, and alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine. Epinephrine infusion was associated with low serum levels of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) except when phentolamine was given simultaneously. These findings are compatible with an alpha receptor mechanism for the epinephrine inhibition of insulin release. Phentolamine had no blocking effects on the tachycardia and widened pulse pressure or lipolytic stimulation by epinephrine, whereas both propranolol and Butoxamine blocked lipolysis, tachycardia, and widened pulse pressure. These findings are consistent with an alpha receptor blocking action for phentolamine and beta receptor blocking action for propranolol and Butoxamine. Inhibition of lipolysis by nicotinic acid did not alter IRI or glucose responses to epinephrine. It is concluded that the lipolytic effect of epinephrine is unrelated to its effects on IRI release. Lipolytic blockade by nicotinic acid also did not change IRI or glucose in fasting subjects or their responses to a glucose infusion, 300 mg per minute. These observations appear to conflict with the Randle hypothesis (the glucose-fatty acid cycle) and raise some doubt as to whether plasma FFA concentrations are direct determinants of glucose or IRI concentrations in normal man.
Seven asthmatic patients were studied in a single-blind randomized, crossover study after oral administration of 20 mg nifedipine or placebo. Four increasing doses of i.v. terbutaline were then given with 30 min interval. The study was concluded with inhalation of five terbutaline puffs. FEV1 measurements 30 min after intake of nifedipine did not show any difference compared to placebo. During the terbutaline treatment, however, there was a more pronounced bronchodilation after nifedipine than after placebo (P less than 0.05). Terbutaline-induced skeletal muscle tremor was similar after nifedipine and placebo pretreatments. After nifedipine intake there was a decrease of diastolic blood pressure and a reflexogenic tachycardia. Thus, this study showed a small potentiation of the beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated bronchodilation, which is of importance when treating patients with simultaneous asthma and hypertension or angina pectoris.
Epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested that powerful cholesterol lowering may have adverse effects on mood and psychological well-being. Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by simvastatin (a hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor) may also reduce steroid hormone biosynthesis. To explore if mood changes are related with steroid hormone levels, we designed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. The separate and combined effects of a Mediterranean-type diet intervention and treatment with simvastatin 20 mg/day PO for 12 weeks were studied in 120 hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy middle-aged men. Psychological functioning was assessed with questionnaires, and steroid hormone levels in blood were assayed radioimmunologically before and after the treatments. Simvastatin resulted in a statistically significant increase of depression and somatization without changes in the anxiety, hostility or aggression scores. Mood changes seemed to be unrelated with the statistically significant but clinically insignificant decline in serum testosterone levels and unrelated with the increase in serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels.
Recent epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a greater than expected number of pediatric patients with congenital heart disease in areas where drinking water was contaminated by halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons. Trichloroethylene, trichloroethane and dichlorethylene were the principal contaminants in the groundwater. A previous study of chick embryos demonstrated that when injected into the air sacs of fertilized eggs trichloroethylene produced more than three times the number of cardiac defects that are found in control embryos. This mammalian study demonstrates similar effects of trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene when applied under provocative circumstances (that is, solutions delivered through a catheter into the gravid uterus from an intraperitoneal osmotic pump) to the developing rat fetus in utero during the period of organ differentiation and development. Furthermore, the effect is dose dependent for both agents. Although only a very small number of congenital heart anomalies (3%) were found in the control group, 9% and 12.5% were found in the lower dose trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene groups and 14% and 21% in the higher dose groups, respectively (p less than 0.05). A variety of cardiac defects were found. Dichloroethylene appears to be at least as great a cardiac teratogen as trichloroethylene even though it was administered at a 10-fold lower concentration. These agents appear to be specific cardiac teratogens because only a single noncardiac anomaly was found. This study in a rat model demonstrates a dose-dependent relation between fetal exposure to trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene in utero during the period of organogenesis and the appearance of a variety of congenital cardiac defects.
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3), a major ingredient of arsenic compounds in traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits anti-acute promyelocytic leukemic activity. Considering that over 80% of human malignant tumors derive from epithelial cells, we studied the effect of As2O3 on HPV 16 DNA-immortalized human cervical epithelial cells (HCE16/3 cells) in vitro. As2O3 reduced HCE16/3 cell survival, induced apoptosis at a low concentration and selectively inhibited expression of viral early genes. This effect was evidenced by a reduction of cell viability in the MTT assay, G1 arrest and significant apoptosis upon flow-cytometric analysis, presence of apoptotic bodies, formation of DNA ladders upon gel electrophoresis and inhibition of viral early gene expression by RT-PCR and Western blot. There was a good correlation between cell apoptosis and viral early gene inhibition after As2O3 treatment, suggesting that induction of apoptosis of HCE16/3 cells by As2O3 treatment might be associated with down-regulation of viral oncogene expression. In conclusion, our findings indicate that As2O3 induces apoptosis of HCE16/3 cells, which may provide a new approach for treating HPV-associated tumors.
The experimental and clinical values of amoxycillin/clavulanate in severe Staphylococcus aureus infections are reviewed. Experimentally, amoxycillin/clavulanate was highly effective in the treatment of acute endocarditis due to methicillin-sensitive isolates of S. aureus (MSSA) in rats. In addition, high doses of amoxycillin/clavulanate also cured experimental endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus (MRSA) in the animal model. In the clinical setting, a review of 86 patients with either community- or hospital-acquired bacteraemia due to MSSA showed that intravenous treatment with amoxycillin/clavulanate was adequate for empirical (and apparently also long-term) therapy of such severe infections. However, the retrospective nature of the analysis did not allow assessment of the relative efficacy of amoxycillin/clavulanate as compared with standard anti-staphylococcal drugs, such as flucloxacillin or vancomycin. Further prospective studies are warranted to address this issue. Thus, amoxycillin/clavulanate appears to be a good candidate for empirical treatment of severe infections that may be caused by MSSA. Usage of amoxycillin/clavulanate against MRSA is, however, still experimental and is not currently advocated for the treatment of MRSA infections in humans.
The effect of several pyrolysate mutagens on the benzodiazepine and GABA receptors was investigated. Of amino-gamma-carbolines, Trp-P-1 antagonized the suppressive effect of diazepam on the pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions and death, whereas Trp-P-2 by itself precipitated seizures and death in male mice. Both Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 inhibited the specific binding of [3H]diazepam and [3H]muscimol in rat brain membranes mainly by increasing Kd, indicating that these gamma-carbolines bind on benzodiazepine and GABA receptors. IC50S of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 on specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding were not changed by addition of GABA. The Hill coefficient of Trp-P-1 for displacing [3H]diazepam binding was about unity whereas that of Trp-P-2 was less than unity. These results suggest that Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 act as active antagonists or inverse agonists at benzodiazepine receptors. The convulsant effect of the gamma-carbolines may be mediated by an action on the central benzodiazepine receptors; however, the role of the effect on GABA receptors is not clear.
Although it is said that drug addiction is associated with poor dental health, there is little research in this area. In particular, there is little work comparing the effects of the different drugs of addiction.
A cross-sectional patient survey of dental health was undertaken in a family practice comparing opiate and other drug addicts (DA) with non-addicts (NA). The age range was restricted to 19-45 years. Damaged teeth were counted and a semi-quantitative score applied to severity to allow the calculation of an overall dental index. A medical review only was undertaken; recognized dental diagnostic criteria were not applied.
There were 233 and 47 respondents in the DA and NA groups, respectively. The mean ages and gender ratios were similar in both groups. DA used more addictive drugs than NA (all P < 0.001). DA had more absent, traumatized, major cavitated and extracted teeth (all P < 0.05). Addicts had a worse severity index (P < 0.02) and dental index (13.13 + 24.00 vs. 4.74 +/- 16.03; P < 0.005). Furthermore, dental pathology developed in DA at younger ages than in NA with 56.8% vs. 5.4% of patients younger than 38 years having dental indices more than 10 respectively (OR = 22.98, 95% CI = 5.57-200.65, P < 0.0000001). At multivariate analysis age, gender, and dose and/or duration of tobacco, methadone, morphine, and alcohol were significantly associated with these pathologies.
These data are consistent with published dental reports and basic science information that drug addiction has a deleterious effect on dental health, that in addiction this effect is rapid and severe, and that tobacco, methadone, morphine and alcohol contribute importantly to these changes.
The biological mechanisms by which environmental metals are associated with birth defects are largely unknown. Systems biology-based approaches may help to identify key pathways that mediate metal-induced birth defects as well as potential targets for prevention.
First, we applied a novel computational approach to identify a prioritized biological pathway that associates metals with birth defects. Second, in a laboratory setting, we sought to determine whether inhibition of the identified pathway prevents developmental defects.
Seven environmental metals were selected for inclusion in the computational analysis: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and selenium. We used an in silico strategy to predict genes and pathways associated with both metal exposure and developmental defects. The most significant pathway was identified and tested using an in ovo whole chick embryo culture assay. We further evaluated the role of the pathway as a mediator of metal-induced toxicity using the in vitro midbrain micromass culture assay.
The glucocorticoid receptor pathway was computationally predicted to be a key mediator of multiple metal-induced birth defects. In the chick embryo model, structural malformations induced by inorganic arsenic (iAs) were prevented when signaling of the glucocorticoid receptor pathway was inhibited. Further, glucocorticoid receptor inhibition demonstrated partial to complete protection from both iAs- and cadmium-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity in vitro.
Our findings highlight a novel approach to computationally identify a targeted biological pathway for examining birth defects prevention.
The dopamine autoreceptor and D3 preferring antagonist [cis-(+)-5-methoxy-1-methyl-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin] (+)-UH232, exerts weak stimulatory effects when tested in locomotor activity experiments using habituated animals. (+)-UH232 also blocks d-amphetamine-, cocaine-, and apomorphine-induced hyperactivity, but fails to induce catalepsy. Thus, the behavioral effects of (+)-UH232 appear to be dependent upon the baseline activity of the animal. The antagonistic properties of (+)-UH232 were studied in the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) technique in the rat. (+)-UH232 and haloperidol produced inhibitory effects over a wide dose range. Cocaine, GBR12909 and d-amphetamine clearly lowered ICSS thresholds, indicating stimulatory effects. (+)-UH232 antagonized the stimulatory effects of cocaine, GBR12909, and d-amphetamine, whereas haloperidol, at a dose producing an inhibition similar to (+)-UH232, was significantly weaker in antagonizing cocaine- or d-amphetamine-induced stimulation. This difference between (+)-UH232 and haloperidol with respect to stimulant-blocking ability, support the concept that the effects of (+)-UH232 are not representative of either classical DA agonists or DA antagonists.
The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate whether antiinflammatory drugs affect the pharmacodynamics of theophylline-induced seizures. Adult male Lewis rats were treated with either dexamethasone (DEX), hydrocortisone (HYD), ibuprofen (IBU), or mefenamic acid (MFA), for 4 consecutive days. On the fourth day they received a constant infusion of theophylline (2 mg/min IV) until the onset of maximal seizures. Then, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained for theophylline concentration determinations by HPLC. It was found that pretreatment with the corticosteroids DEX and HYD elevated the CSF theophylline concentration required to induce maximal seizures in comparison to the untreated rats (242 +/- 6, 232 +/- 6, and 203 +/- 10 mg/l, respectively, n = 10, p < 0.05). MFA also increased the CSF theophylline concentration at that end-point in comparison to the controls (p < 0.01), whereas pretreatment with IBU had no effect (280 +/- 10 MFA, 225 +/- 9 IBU vs. 220 +/- 8 controls, n = 12). The data suggests that concomitant treatment with antiinflammatory drugs, together with theophylline, do not increase the risk for theophylline-induced seizures. Moreover, in certain cases they may elevate the seizure threshold and protect against these hazardous episodes.
