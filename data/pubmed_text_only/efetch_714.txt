Treatment of minimal change disease, like most glomerulonephritides, is empirical because underlying mechanisms that cause glomerular injury are not known. We examined a pathogenic role of 'catalytic' iron in a model of minimal change nephrotic syndrome induced by injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (7.5 mg/100 g body wt) to rats. Although there was no significant change in non-heme iron content in glomeruli, the bleomycin-detectable iron (capable of catalyzing free radical reactions) was markedly increased in glomeruli from nephrotic rats when compared to control. In contrast, despite a marked and significant increase in the non-heme iron content in tubules, there was no significant change in the bleomycin-detectable iron in tubules from nephrotic rats. In a separate in vivo study, the iron chelator, deferoxamine, prevented the increase in the bleomycin-detectable iron in glomeruli and provided complete protection against proteinuria. Taken together, our data suggest an important pathogenetic role for glomerular catalytic iron in the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced minimal change nephrotic syndrome.
Noonan syndrome is characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphia and a wide spectrum of congenital heart defects. Mutations of PTPN11, KRAS and SOS1 in the RAS-MAPK pathway cause approximately 60% of cases of Noonan syndrome. However, the gene(s) responsible for the remainder are unknown. We have identified five different mutations in RAF1 in ten individuals with Noonan syndrome; those with any of four mutations causing changes in the CR2 domain of RAF1 had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), whereas affected individuals with mutations leading to changes in the CR3 domain did not. Cells transfected with constructs containing Noonan syndrome-associated RAF1 mutations showed increased in vitro kinase and ERK activation, and zebrafish embryos with morpholino knockdown of raf1 demonstrated the need for raf1 for the development of normal myocardial structure and function. Thus, our findings implicate RAF1 gain-of-function mutations as a causative agent of a human developmental disorder, representing a new genetic mechanism for the activation of the MAPK pathway.
A series of N-Aroyl-cyclohexyl- and cyclohexenylamides 3- or 4-methylsubstituted were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic potencies, and gastrointestinal irritation liability. One compound, N-benzoyl-4-methyl-cyclohexylamide 6a, possessed an anti-inflammatory activity comparable to that of indomethacin.
Recent behavioral reports suggest that repeated exposure to cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid agonists is linked with mental disorders associated with dysfunction of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor neurotransmission such as anxiety and depression. Here, we studied the effect of a nonselective cannabinoid agonist, CP55940, on the activity of 5-HT2A receptors in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). We detected that repeated exposure to CP55940 enhanced the prolactin and corticosterone neuroendocrine responses mediated by 5-HT2A receptors and increased the membrane-associated levels of 5-HT2A receptors in PVN. Importantly, we also detected increased anxiety-like behaviors in CP55940 treated rats compared to controls. The data presented here suggest that the mechanisms mediating the cannabinoid-induced upregulation of 5-HT2A receptors would be brain-region specific, as we were unable to detect a CP55940-induced upregulation of 5-HT2A mRNA. Our results might provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which repeated exposure to cannabinoids could be associated with the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.
We performed a genome-wide association scan to search for sequence variants conferring risk of prostate cancer using 1,501 Icelandic men with prostate cancer and 11,290 controls. Follow-up studies involving three additional case-control groups replicated an association of two variants on chromosome 17 with the disease. These two variants, 33 Mb apart, fall within a region previously implicated by family-based linkage studies on prostate cancer. The risks conferred by these variants are moderate individually (allele odds ratio of about 1.20), but because they are common, their joint population attributable risk is substantial. One of the variants is in TCF2 (HNF1beta), a gene known to be mutated in individuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5. Results from eight case-control groups, including one West African and one Chinese, demonstrate that this variant confers protection against type 2 diabetes.
1,3-Dichloro-2-propanol (1,3-DCP) is a well-known contaminant that has been detected in a wide range of foods. Dietary intake represents the greatest source of exposure to 1,3-DCP. In the study, we first found 1,3-DCP could induce hyperlipidemia in C57BL/6J mice below 1 mg/kg/day. We investigated serum lipid profile, liver total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG), histopathology of Liver and adipose tissue. The results showed 1,3-DCP dose dependently increased serum TG, TC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), decreased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), increased relative liver weight, liver TG and TC, relative adipose tissue weight and enlarged the size of adipose cells. Because AMPK signal pathway is important in the process of lipid metabolism, we further investigated the effects of 1,3-DCP on AMPK signaling pathway in murine models. The results showed that 1,3-DCP (0.1-1 mg/kg/day) decreased p-AMPK/tAMPK ratio, p-ACC/tACC ratio, PPARÎ± expression, but increased FAT, SREBP1, HMGCR and FAS expression. These observations indicated that 1,3-DCP induced hyperlipidemia in C57BL/6J mice at least partially through regulating AMPK signaling pathway.
Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes are developmental disorders with overlapping features, including cardiac abnormalities, short stature and facial dysmorphia. Increased RAS signaling owing to PTPN11, SOS1 and KRAS mutations causes approximately 60% of Noonan syndrome cases, and PTPN11 mutations cause 90% of LEOPARD syndrome cases. Here, we report that 18 of 231 individuals with Noonan syndrome without known mutations (corresponding to 3% of all affected individuals) and two of six individuals with LEOPARD syndrome without PTPN11 mutations have missense mutations in RAF1, which encodes a serine-threonine kinase that activates MEK1 and MEK2. Most mutations altered a motif flanking Ser259, a residue critical for autoinhibition of RAF1 through 14-3-3 binding. Of 19 subjects with a RAF1 mutation in two hotspots, 18 (or 95%) showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), compared with the 18% prevalence of HCM among individuals with Noonan syndrome in general. Ectopically expressed RAF1 mutants from the two HCM hotspots had increased kinase activity and enhanced ERK activation, whereas non-HCM-associated mutants were kinase impaired. Our findings further implicate increased RAS signaling in pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
Despite optimal and early surgical treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), many patients die of recurrent NSCLC. We investigated the association between gene methylation and recurrence of the tumor.
Fifty-one patients with stage I NSCLC who underwent curative resection but who had a recurrence within 40 months after resection (case patients) were matched on the basis of age, NSCLC stage, sex, and date of surgery to 116 patients with stage I NSCLC who underwent curative resection but who did not have a recurrence within 40 months after resection (controls). We investigated whether the methylation of seven genes in tumor and lymph nodes was associated with tumor recurrence.
In a multivariate model, promoter methylation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene p16, the H-cadherin gene CDH13, the Ras association domain family 1 gene RASSF1A, and the adenomatous polyposis coli gene APC in tumors and in histologically tumor-negative lymph nodes was associated with tumor recurrence, independently of NSCLC stage, age, sex, race, smoking history, and histologic characteristics of the tumor. Methylation of the promoter regions of p16 and CDH13 in both tumor and mediastinal lymph nodes was associated with an odds ratio of recurrent cancer of 15.50 in the original cohort and an odds ratio of 25.25 when the original cohort was combined with an independent validation cohort of 20 patients with stage I NSCLC.
Methylation of the promoter region of the four genes in patients with stage I NSCLC treated with curative intent by means of surgery is associated with early recurrence.
We studied genes involved in pancreatic beta cell function and survival, identifying associations between SNPs in WFS1 and diabetes risk in UK populations that we replicated in an Ashkenazi population and in additional UK studies. In a pooled analysis comprising 9,533 cases and 11,389 controls, SNPs in WFS1 were strongly associated with diabetes risk. Rare mutations in WFS1 cause Wolfram syndrome; using a gene-centric approach, we show that variation in WFS1 also predisposes to common type 2 diabetes.
Children exposed during pregnancy to the anticonvulsant drugs phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine as monotherapy and polytherapy have an increased frequency of midface and digit hypoplasia. Some children also have cognitive dysfunction. The hypothesis tested is that the anticonvulsant drug-exposed child with midface and digit hypoplasia is more likely to have cognitive dysfunction.
Children exposed to anticonvulsant drugs (n = 80) were recruited for a follow-up evaluation, which included testing cognitive function and a physical examination for head size, height, and the presence of midface and digit hypoplasia. Microcephaly, midface and digit hypoplasia, and major malformations were correlated with full scale (FSI), performance (PIQ) and verbal (VIQ) intelligence.
The presence of the 3 anticonvulsant-exposed children with microcephaly had a deficit of 23.7 IQ points in FSI in comparison with the other children with a normal head size. Either midface or digit hypoplasia, after excluding the persons with microcephaly and with the Bonferroni correction, correlated significantly with deficits in VIQ (-12.7), PIQ (-10) and FSI (-12.8) IQ points ( P = .0061). There was no decrease in IQ in association with major malformations.
The presence of midface and digit hypoplasia in a child exposed to anticonvulsant drugs in pregnancy is an indication for a systematic developmental evaluation.
Organophosphate (OP) and carbamate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors produce seizures and lethality in mammals. Anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists encourage the investigation of their effects in AChE inhibitor-induced poisonings. In the present study, the effects of dizocilpine (MK-801, 1 mg/kg) or 3-((RS)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, 10 mg/kg), alone or combined with muscarinic antagonist atropine (1.8 mg/kg), on convulsant and lethal properties of an OP pesticide dichlorvos or a carbamate drug physostigmine, were studied in mice. Both dichlorvos and physostigmine induced dose-dependent seizure activity and lethality. Atropine did not prevent the occurrence of convulsions but decreased the lethal effects of both dichlorvos and physostigmine. MK-801 or CPP blocked or attenuated, respectively, dichlorvos-induced convulsions. Contrariwise, NMDA antagonists had no effect in physostigmine-induced seizures or lethality produced by dichlorvos or physostigmine. Concurrent pretreatment with atropine and either MK-801 or CPP blocked or alleviated seizures produced by dichlorvos, but not by physostigmine. Both MK-801 and CPP co-administered with atropine enhanced its antilethal effects in both dichlorvos and physostigmine poisoning. In both saline- and AChE inhibitor-treated mice, no interaction of the investigated antidotes with brain cholinesterase was found. The data indicate that both muscarinic ACh and NMDA receptor-mediated mechanisms contribute to the acute toxicity of AChE inhibitors, and NMDA receptors seem critical to OP-induced seizures.
Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an anticonvulsant drug used to treat epilepsy and mood disorders. However, it can cause birth defects like reduced head circumference. It was recently shown to protect against brain overgrowth and seizure-induced abnormal plasticity in the megalencephalic mice Kv1.1(mceph/mceph), (mceph/mceph) despite remaining seizures. The mceph/mceph mouse displays two-fold enlarged hippocampus due to more neurons and astrocytes. Using stereology, we found that CBZ normalized the number of neurons and astrocytes in mceph/mceph hippocampus. To characterize CBZ's protective ability on brain growth we studied the gene expression profile of mceph/mceph and wild type hippocampus, with and without CBZ treatment. Microarray analysis revealed transcripts involved in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis including; NPY, Penk, Vgf, Mlc1, Sstr4, ApoD, Ndn, Aatk, Rgs2 and Gabra5, where Vgf may be of particular interest. The results also support CBZ's effect on synaptic transmission through GABA A receptors, which could promote apoptotic neurodegeneration, affecting cell number.
Antitumour effects of retinoids are attributed to their influence on cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. In our effort to develop useful agents for breast cancer therapy, we evaluated the effects of four representative retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBAs, VN/14-1, VN/50-1, VN/66-1 and VN/69-1) on growth inhibition of oestrogen receptor positive (ER +ve, MCF-7 and T-47D) and oestrogen receptor negative (ER -ve, MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cells. Additionally, we investigated the biological effects/molecular mechanism(s) underlying their growth inhibitory properties as well as their antitumour efficacies against MCF-7 and MCF-7Ca tumour xenografts in nude mice. We also assessed the effect of combining VN/14-1 and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) on MCF-7 tumour xenografts. The ER +ve cell lines were more sensitive (IC(50) values between 3.0 and 609 nM) to the RAMBAs than the ER -ve MDA-MB-231 cell line (IC(50)=5.6-24.0 microM). Retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents induced cell differentiation as determined by increased expression of cytokeratin 8/18 and oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha). Similar to ATRA, they also induced apoptosis via activation of caspase 9. Cell cycle analysis indicated that RAMBAs arrested cells in the G1 and G2/M phases and caused significant downregulation (>80%) of cyclin D1 protein. In vivo, the growth of MCF-7 mammary tumours was dose-dependently and significantly inhibited (92.6%, P<0.0005) by VN/14-1. The combination of VN/14-1 and ATRA also inhibited MCF-7 breast tumour growth in vivo (up to 120%) as compared with single agents (P<0.025). VN/14-1 was also very effective in preventing the formation of MCF-7Ca tumours and it significantly inhibited the growth of established MCF-7Ca tumours, being as effective as the clinically used aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole and letrozole. Decrease in cyclin D1 and upregulation of cytokeratins, Bad and Bax with VN/14-1 may be responsible for the efficacy of this compound in inhibiting breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that our RAMBAs, especially VN/14-1 may be useful novel therapy for breast cancer.
Cocaine self-administration alters patterns of gene expression in the brain that may underlie cocaine-induced neuronal plasticity. In the present study, male Sprague Dawley rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine (0.25 mg/infusion) 2 h/d for 14 d, followed by 7 d of forced abstinence. Compared with yoked saline control rats, cocaine self-administration resulted in increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To examine the functional relevance of this finding, cocaine self-administration maintained under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement was assessed after short hairpin RNA-induced suppression of BDNF expression in the mPFC. Decreased BDNF expression in the mPFC increased the cocaine self-administration breakpoint. Next, the effect of cocaine self-administration on specific BDNF exons was assessed; results revealed selectively increased BDNF exon IV-containing transcripts in the mPFC. Moreover, there were significant cocaine-induced increases in acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) and phospho-cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) association with BDNF promoter IV. In contrast, there was decreased methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) association with BDNF promoter IV in the mPFC of rats that previously self-administered cocaine. Together, these results indicate that cocaine-induced increases in BDNF promoter IV transcript in the mPFC are driven by increased binding of AcH3 and pCREB as well as decreased MeCP2 binding at this BDNF promoter. Collectively, these results indicate that cocaine self-administration remodels chromatin in the mPFC, resulting in increased expression of BDNF, which appears to represent a compensatory neuroadaptation that reduces the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine.
The groggy rat (strain name; GRY) exhibits ataxia, an unstable gait, and paroxysmal severe extension of the entire body. Adults show a reduction in size of the cerebellum and presynaptic and axon terminal abnormalities of Purkinje cells. These neurological abnormalities are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and the causative mutation has been named groggy (gry). In this study, we mapped gry on rat chromosome 19 and found a nonconservative missense (M251K) mutation in the alpha(1A) subunit of the P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel gene (Cacna1a) within the gry-critical region. This mutation was located at a highly conserved site close to the ion-selective pore and led to the shortening of the inactivation phase of the Ca(2+) channel current without a change of peak current density or current-voltage relationship in whole cell patch recordings of the recombinant Ca(2+) channel expressed in HEK cells. It has been well established that mice with a mutation at Cacna1a such as tottering and leaner show absence seizures. The Cacna1a-mutant GRY rat also exhibited absence-like seizures from 6 to 8 weeks of age, which were characterized by bilateral and synchronous 7-8 Hz spike-and-wave discharges concomitant with sudden immobility and staring, on cortical and hippocampal EEGs. The pharmacological profile of the seizures was similar to that of human absence epilepsy: the seizures were inhibited by ethosuximide and valproic acid but not phenytoin. Thus, the GRY rat with P/Q-type Ca(2+) channel disorders is a useful model for studying absence epilepsy and Cacna1a-related diseases.
Psychiatrists and general practitioners are already well acquainted with amineptine. It nevertheless appeared interesting to expand previous clinical trials concerning use in hospitalized patients and outpatients. The results of this extensive study involving 1354 cases coming from 13 french regions confirm and specify the therapeutic indications in the various types of depression as well as its status within the antidepressant group. The low occurrence of side effects and the remarkable acceptability were also confirmed by this larger-scale study performed by 162 experimenters, all of whom were psychiatrists. The two most remarkable points arising from this study were the homogeneity of results for each region, as well as their consistency with previous findings during the clinical trial phase. Overall results in depressive disorders were: 76% positive (of which 52% very good and good results), particularly concerning melancholia (201 cases) and neurotic or reactive depressions (815 cases). Extensive evaluation of results indicated that amineptine was a fast acting desinhibiting antidepressant.
Two hundred patients requiring sedation for minor oral surgery were randomly allocated to receive either midazolam or diazepam as Diazemuls intravenously through a 23-gauge indwelling needle in the dorsum of the hand. The site of injection was inspected at 7 days and 14 days post injection and assessed for pain, tenderness, redness, induration, painless thrombosis, and thrombophlebitis. The mean dose administered was 0.119 mg/kg of midazolam and 0.298 mg/kg of Diazemuls. At 7 days there was no significant difference in venous complications. At the 14 day follow up, the midazolam group had a significantly greater incidence of tenderness and redness (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05 respectively using Chi squared test). The incidence of thrombophlebitis in the midazolam group was 2% at 7 days and 1% at 14 days, the corresponding figures in those given Diazemuls being none and 1% respectively. We conclude that the dorsum of the hand is a satisfactory site of injection for administration of these drugs. The higher incidence of minor complications at 14 days following midazolam was offset by its more reliable amnesic properties.
Vitamin B(12) contains a cobalt complex and accumulates at high levels in the liver. Vitamin B(12) was examined for its hepatoprotective effect on dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver injury in mice. Vitamin B(12) decreased the blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and clearly inhibited the overaccumulation of collagen fibrils. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the liver showed that the gene expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and heat-shock protein 47, which are markers of fibrosis, were suppressed by vitamin B(12) administration. Our findings indicate that vitamin B(12) could be an effective hepatoprotective agent.
Reproductive function was studied in 31 adult male patients with BehÃ§et's disease during treatment with cyclophosphamide and/or colchicine for 1 to 64 months. Semen was obtained from 27 patients. Azoospermia or severe oligospermia was found in 13 of 17 patients receiving cyclophosphamide with or without colchicine, whereas the sperm count was almost normal in six patients treated with colchicine alone and in four patients receiving neither drug (control patients). Blood samples were available for 31 patients. The mean follicle-stimulating hormone level among 12 cyclophosphamide-treated patients was significantly higher than that of 6 colchicine-treated patients and 6 control patients. These results indicate that cyclophosphamide impairs spermatogenesis in adult men, whereas colchicine does not.
The prognosis of patients with a history of successfully treated malignancy, who subsequently undergo organ transplantation and long-term immunosuppression, is uncertain. We report the case of a 14-year-old girl in whom doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy developed after aggressive therapy for a fibroblastic osteosarcoma. The patient underwent orthotopic heart transplantation and remains in remission 14 months after surgery.
5-Fluorouracil (5FU) remains one of the most frequently prescribed chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of cancer. Recently, the pivotal role of the catabolic pathway of 5FU in the determination of toxicity towards 5FU has been highlighted. Patients with a (partial) dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency proved to be at risk of developing severe toxicity after the administration of 5FU. A partial dihydropyrimidinase deficiency proved to be a novel pharmacogenetic disorder associated with severe 5FU toxicity.
Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) deficiency occurs with polymorphic frequencies in Caucasians and results in the benign accumulation of the inosine nucleotide ITP. In 62 patients treated with azathioprine for inflammatory bowel disease, the ITPA 94C>A deficiency-associated allele was significantly associated with adverse drug reactions (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.6-11.5, p = 0.0034). Significant associations were found for flu-like symptoms (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2-18.1, p = 0.0308), rash (OR 10.3, 95% CI 4.7-62.9, p = 0.0213) and pancreatitis (OR 6.2, CI 1.1-32.6, p = 0.0485). Polymorphism in the ITPA gene thus predicts AZA intolerance. Alternative immunosuppressive drugs, particularly 6-thioguanine, should be considered for AZA-intolerant patients with ITPase deficiency.
The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) is known to play a role in gating and control of seizures. Prompted by the observation that intrahippocampal topiramate (TPM) administration does not suppress limbic seizures in the focal pilocarpine model, we investigated the role of the SNR in the anticonvulsant mechanism of action of TPM.
Limbic seizures were evoked in freely moving rats by intrahippocampal administration of pilocarpine via a microdialysis probe. Changes in hippocampal extracellular (EC) glutamate and GABA concentrations were monitored. Effects of intraperitoneal (10-200 mg/kg), intrahippocampal (1-5 mM), and bilateral intranigral (100-300 nmol) TPM administration on pilocarpine-induced seizures and neurochemical changes were evaluated. Effects of TPM administration alone on hippocampal and nigral EC amino acid concentrations were also studied.
Systemic and intranigral, but not intrahippocampal TPM administration suppressed pilocarpine-induced seizures and neurochemical changes. Nigral GABA(A) receptor blockade by picrotoxin abolished the anticonvulsant effect of TPM in SNR. Systemic TPM administration increased hippocampal glutamate and decreased GABA. Intranigral TPM administration increased hippocampal glutamate, but not GABA. Intrahippocampal TPM increased hippocampal glutamate and GABA, but only at high concentrations.
In the focal pilocarpine model, TPM does not exert its anticonvulsant effect at the site of seizure initiation. We identified the SNR as a site of action of TPM, and showed that the nigral GABA-ergic system is central to TPM's anticonvulsant effect in SNR. Anticonvulsant effects and neurochemical changes in hippocampus following intranigral TPM administration suggest the existence of a nigro-hippocampal circuit, which may be involved in the control of limbic seizures.
In the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat, copper accumulates in the liver because of a mutation in the copper-transporting ATPase gene, and peroxidative stresses are supposed to be augmented. We examined the effects of dietary fatty acids on hepatitis, hepatic gene expression, and survival. Rats were fed a conventional, low-fat diet (CE2), a CE2 diet supplemented with 10 wt% of lard (Lar), high-linoleic soybean oil (Soy), or a mixture of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich fish oil and soybean oil (DHA/Soy). Among female rats, the mean survival times of the DHA/Soy and the Soy groups were longer by 17 approximately 20% than in the Lar and the CE2 groups. Among male rats, the survival times were much longer than in the females, but no significant difference in survival was observed among the dietary groups. Serum ceruloplasmin levels in female and male rats of all of the dietary groups were similar. Serum transaminase levels of the DHA/Soy group tended to be lower than in the CE2 group. Histological examinations revealed a marked degeneration in hepatic tissue integrity in the Lar and CE2 groups but not in the DHA/Soy group. Hepatic levels of metal-related genes, transferrin and ceruloplasmin, as well as those related to bile acid synthesis were up-regulated, and an inflammation-related gene (cyclooxygenase [COX]-2) was down-regulated in the DHA/Soy group. Some proliferation-related genes were also affected by the dietary fatty acids. These results indicate that polyunsaturated fatty acids suppress the development of acute hepatitis and prolong survival in females, regardless of whether they are of the n-6 or n-3 type, which are associated with altered gene expressions.
The comparative anti-arrhythmic effect of equivalent daily doses of conventional propranolol ('Inderal') and long-acting propranolol ('Inderal' LA) was assessed in a double-blind, crossover study lasting 6 weeks in 13 patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Patients were investigated using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. Both formulations of propranolol significantly reduced the heart rate, together with the number of ventricular premature beats and ventricular couplets, with no significant difference between treatments. The two formulations also produced similar plasma concentrations of propranolol. The long-acting formulation of propranolol proved an effective anti-arrhythmic treatment which, with once-daily dosage, may improve patient compliance with treatment.
Haploinsufficiency for human EYA1, a homologue of the Drosophila melanogaster gene eyes absent (eya), results in the dominantly inherited disorders branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome and branchio-oto (BO) syndrome, which are characterized by craniofacial abnormalities and hearing loss with (BOR) or without (BO) kidney defects. To understand the developmental pathogenesis of organs affected in these syndromes, we inactivated the gene Eya1 in mice. Eya1 heterozygotes show renal abnormalities and a conductive hearing loss similar to BOR syndrome, whereas Eya1 homozygotes lack ears and kidneys due to defective inductive tissue interactions and apoptotic regression of the organ primordia. Inner ear development in Eya1 homozygotes arrests at the otic vesicle stage and all components of the inner ear and specific cranial sensory ganglia fail to form. In the kidney, Eya1 homozygosity results in an absence of ureteric bud outgrowth and a subsequent failure of metanephric induction. Gdnf expression, which is required to direct ureteric bud outgrowth via activation of the c-ret Rtk (refs 5, 6, 7, 8), is not detected in Eya1-/- metanephric mesenchyme. In Eya1-/- ear and kidney development, Six but not Pax expression is Eya1 dependent, similar to a genetic pathway elucidated in the Drosophila eye imaginal disc. Our results indicate that Eya1 controls critical early inductive signalling events involved in ear and kidney formation and integrate Eya1 into the genetic regulatory cascade controlling kidney formation upstream of Gdnf. In addition, our results suggest that an evolutionarily conserved Pax-Eya-Six regulatory hierarchy is used in mammalian ear and kidney development.
