Autism is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed in early childhood. Growth factors have been found to play a key role in the cellular differentiation and proliferation of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is detected in several regions of the developing and adult brain, where, it enhances the differentiation, maturation, and survival of a variety of neurons. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) isoforms play an important role in neuronal survival, and the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to exhibit neurotrophic activity. We examined the association of EGF, TGFbeta1, and HGF genes with autism, in a trio association study, using DNA samples from families recruited to the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange; 252 trios with a male offspring scored for autism were selected for the study. Transmission disequilibrium test revealed significant haplotypic association of EGF with autism. No significant SNP or haplotypic associations were observed for TGFbeta1 or HGF. Given the role of EGF in brain and neuronal development, we suggest a possible role of EGF in the pathogenesis of autism.
Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) is a key regulator of IGF activity that has been associated with insulin resistance and obesity. In cows, IGFBP2 mRNA expression is differentially regulated according to nutritional status in different tissues including the liver, reproductive tract, and mammary gland. This study investigated associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in bovine IGFBP2 with fertility, milk production, and metabolic traits in Holstein-Friesian dairy cows. Fertility was assessed in heifers by measuring age at first service, age at first conception, and age at first calving. During the first and second lactation, the number of postpartum days for commencement of luteal activity (based on milk progesterone profiles), days to first service, days to conception, average milk production per day, 305-day milk yield, total milk yield, and total days in milk were recorded. Blood samples were taken at -1, +1, and +8 weeks relative to first and second calving for assessment of metabolic status (IGF1, insulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and glucose). Five novel SNPs were identified in IGFBP2, two of which had significant associations with fertility (age at conception in heifers and commencement of luteal activity) and 305-day milk yield in lactation 1. Trends of association were also observed with the peripartum metabolic status, in particular the glucose, insulin, and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations around second calving. These results indicate that IGFBP2 SNPs may influence tissue mobilization in dairy cows and may thus be of interest for marker assisted selection.
Imatinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can block activity of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and that has immunomodulatory effects on various cell types. Here we measured the protective effects of imatinib in Wistar-Kyoto rats with nephrotoxic serum nephritis, a kidney disease model where CD8+ T cells and macrophages play pathogenetic roles. Groups of animals were given imatinib from one day before up to 13 days following induction of nephritis and from day 7 to 20 following disease induction. Compared to control rats, at each time point imatinib treatment caused significantly less proteinuria, lowered serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and decreased the number of glomeruli with necrosis, crescents, and fibrin deposits. Imatinib-treated rats had a significant reduction in glomerular macrophage accumulation and reduced renal cortical PDGFR-beta and M-CSF receptor mRNA expression. Using colocalization we found that glomerular macrophages had reduced IL-1beta and MCP-1 protein expression. Late imatinib treatment significantly reduced proteinuria, serum blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, and reversed renal histopathological changes. We show that imatinib has renoprotective and therapeutic properties and provide pre-clinical work that will need to be confirmed in patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis.
Eleven patients with acute hepatitis following multiple anaesthetics with halothane have been seen at two hospitals during the last four years. Six had massive hepatic necrosis and died. Unexplained fever occurred in nine of the patients; two of these and one other had had previous episodes of jaundice after halothane anaesthesia. Thus, in ten patients the disease could have been avoided.
Two flavonoids, genistein and apigenin, have been implicated as chemopreventive agents against prostate and breast cancers. However, the mechanisms behind their respective cancer-protective effects may vary significantly. The goal of this study was to determine whether the antiproliferative action of these flavonoids on prostate (DU-145) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells expressing only estrogen receptor (ER) beta is mediated by this ER subtype. It was found that both genistein and apigenin, although not 17beta-estradiol, exhibited antiproliferative effects and proapoptotic activities through caspase-3 activation in these two cell lines. In yeast transcription assays, both flavonoids displayed high specificity toward ERbeta transactivation, particularly at lower concentrations. However, in mammalian assay, apigenin was found to be more ERbeta-selective than genistein, which has equal potency in inducing transactivation through ERalpha and ERbeta. Small interfering RNA-mediated downregulation of ERbeta abrogated the antiproliferative effect of apigenin in both cancer cells but did not reverse that of genistein. Our data unveil, for the first time, that the anticancer action of apigenin is mediated, in part, by ERbeta. The differential use of ERalpha and ERbeta signaling for transaction between genistein and apigenin demonstrates the complexity of phytoestrogen action in the context of their anticancer properties.
Shortly after chemotherapy, relatively little is known about the expression of key genes and proteins involved in glycolysis. Doxorubicin (DOX) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) are two commonly used chemotherapy agents that work through differing pathways. Glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) and hexokinase II (HKII) proteins are highly expressed in many breast carcinomas, but their status while undergoing DOX or 5FU chemotherapy has not been systematically evaluated.
We evaluated, in vitro, the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of Glut-1 and HKII in MCF-7, a breast adenocarcinoma cell line, and (3)H-FDG uptake, both in untreated conditions and during treatment with either DOX or 5FU for 24 h. Six time points were evaluated: untreated at time 0; treated for 1 h; treated for 24 h; and 1, 2, and 3 d after chemotherapy. We analyzed tumor cell Glut-1 and HKII mRNA expression with real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, (3)H-FDG uptake per cell, and cell viability with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide assay.
DOX was more effective than 5FU in killing the cancer cells under our study conditions. In untreated MCF-7 cells, the mRNA levels of HKII were typically higher than those of Glut-1, and (3)H-FDG uptake was strongly related to Glut-1 mRNA expression (R(2) = 0.85). Once treated with either drug, (3)H-FDG uptake declined initially, the mRNA ratio was reversed, and Glut-1 mRNA levels were higher than HKII levels. This was verified in the protein assay. With DOX treatment, the cells showed increased Glut-1 mRNA and decreased HKII mRNA for the duration of active treatment; these levels returned to those seen in the untreated cells once the treatment was stopped for 24 h. However, HKII protein levels remained somewhat low. No correlation was seen between (3)H-FDG uptake and HKII mRNA in DOX- and 5FU-treated cells (R(2) = 0.14 and 0.0038, respectively).
After DOX or 5FU therapy, the relationship between (3)H-FDG uptake and viable cell number can become disjointed, with transient declines in (3)H-FDG uptake in excess of the decline in cell number despite increased Glut-1 mRNA levels. This transient "stunning" has potential implications for (3)H-FDG PET, especially soon after treatment is initiated. However, (3)H-FDG remains a generally valid marker of viable cell number after cancer chemotherapy.
We report a patient affected with Moebius Syndrome (OMIM 157900) due to the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of the pregnancy, when abortion was intended twice using this drug, vias vaginal (600 mg) and oral (900 mg), with failure to induce abortion on both occasions. Since the use of misoprostol for abortion, without any medical indication or supervision, appears to be rather frequent in our population and since there are reports of severe malformations in children born after failed intents of abortion with this medication, it is necessary to alert the medical community and the population in general about the teratogenic risks of this drug.
We report on a female who is compound heterozygote for two new point mutations in the CYP19 gene. The allele inherited from her mother presented a base pair deletion (C) occurring at P408 (CCC, exon 9), causing a frameshift that results in a nonsense codon 111 bp (37 aa) further down in the CYP19 gene. The allele inherited from her father showed a point mutation from G-->A at the splicing point (canonical GT to mutational AT) between exon and intron 3. This mutation ignores the splice site and a stop codon 3 bp downstream occurs. Aromatase deficiency was already suspected because of the marked virilization occurring prepartum in the mother, and the diagnosis was confirmed shortly after birth. Extremely low levels of serum estrogens were found in contrast to high levels of androgens. Ultrasonographic follow-up studies revealed persistently enlarged ovaries (19.5-22 mL) during early childhood (2 to 4 yr) which contained numerous large cysts up to 4.8 x 3.7 cm and normal-appearing large tertiary follicles already at the age of 2 yr. In addition, both basal and GnRH-induced FSH levels remained consistently strikingly elevated. Low-dose estradiol (E2) (0.4 mg/day) given for 50 days at the age of 3 6/12 yr resulted in normalization of serum gonadotropin levels, regression of ovarian size, and increase of whole body and lumbar spine (L1-L4) bone mineral density. The FSH concentration and ovarian size returned to pretreatment levels shortly (150 days) after cessation of E2 therapy. Therefore, we recommend that affected females be treated with low-dose E2 in amounts sufficient to result in physiological prepubertal E2 concentrations using an ultrasensitive estrogen assay. However, E2 replacement needs to be adjusted throughout childhood and puberty to ensure normal skeletal maturation and adequate adolescent growth spurt, normal accretion of bone mineral density, and, at the appropriate age, female secondary sex maturation.
Controlled clinical trials have shown that beta-blockers can produce hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in chronic heart failure, but the effect of these drugs on survival has not been determined.
We enrolled 1094 patients with chronic heart failure in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified program, in which patients were assigned to one of the four treatment protocols on the basis of their exercise capacity. Within each of the four protocols patients with mild, moderate, or severe heart failure with left ventricular ejection fractions < or = 0.35 were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 398) or the beta-blocker carvedilol (n = 696); background therapy with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor remained constant. Patient were observed for the occurrence death or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons during the following 6 months, after the beginning (12 months for the group with mild heart failure).
The overall mortality rate was 7.8 percent in the placebo group and 3.2 percent in the carvedilol group; the reduction in risk attributable to carvedilol was 65 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 80 percent; P < 0.001). This finding led the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to recommend termination of the study before its scheduled completion. In addition, as compared with placebo, carvedilol therapy was accompanied by a 27 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (19.6 percent vs. 14.1 percent, P = 0.036), as well as a 38 percent reduction in the combined risk of hospitalization or death (24.6 percent vs, 15.8 percent, P < 0.001). Worsening heart failure as an adverse reaction during treatment was less frequent in the carvedilol than in the placebo group.
Carvedilol reduces the risk or death as well as the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes in patients with heart failure who are receiving treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor.
Over a five-year period 86 patients presented to a renal unit with a history of prolonged analgesic abuse and no other obvious cause of renal damage. Anaemia and peptic ulceration were common, and neurological states suggestive of chronic analgesic intoxication occurred in 22 patients. Thirty-two patients died during follow-up, but the prognosis was much better in patients who ceased abuse of compound analgesics, and improvement could occur even in advanced renal failure. While 84 patients had taken mixtures containing both aspirin and phenacetin, papillary necrosis was also found in two patients who had abused only aspirin, and when phenacetin was withdrawn from several leading compound analgesics, renal function continued to deteriorate in patients ingesting those preparations.
To report on the incidence and relative risk of tinnitus onset from a variety of drug therapies known to be ototoxic. Two main questions were asked: (1) What is the prevalence and incidence of tinnitus among patients treated with cisplatin, carboplatin, or ototoxic antibiotic therapies? (2) Do commonly reported treatment or subject factors confound or modify the incidence of tinnitus onset?
A prospective observational study design was used to evaluate occurrence of significant otologic changes in 488 veterans (962 ears) receiving chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, carboplatin), ototoxic antibiotics (primarily aminoglycoside), or nonototoxic drugs (control medications). A subset of 260 veterans lacking tinnitus prior to drug exposure was used to compare rates of tinnitus onset. Subjects were tested prior to, during, and following their treatment. Planned comparisons using logistic regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and chi(2) statistics were made among groups by the type of medication taken, age, presence of preexisting hearing loss, days on drug, and cumulative dose of drug.
Baseline tinnitus rates were high (nearly 47%) relative to the general population of a similar age. Subjects with exposure to ototoxic medications had significantly increased risk for developing tinnitus. Those on chemotherapeutic agents were found to have the greatest risk. Cisplatin elevated the risk by 5.53 times while carboplatin increased the risk by 3.75 over nonototoxic control medications. Ototoxic antibiotics resulted in borderline risk (2.81) for new tinnitus. Contrary to other reports, we did not find that subject factors (increased age or pre-existing hearing loss) or treatment factors (days on drug or cumulative dose) contributed to rates of tinnitus onset during treatment.
This large prospective study confirms that new tinnitus during treatment is associated with chemotherapy and with certain ototoxic antibiotic treatment. Cisplatin and carboplatin were found to be the most potent ototoxic agents causing tinnitus at much greater numbers than the other drugs studied. Implications for counseling and audiological resource allocation are discussed.
Acute hemolysis as a reaction to rifampicin is extremely rare; case reports number less than 15. We recently evaluated a 65-year-old Cambodian refugee who self-regulated the use of rifampicin and isoniazid for pulmonary tuberculosis. Fifteen minutes after a single discontinuous oral dose, he developed flank pain, chills, rigors, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and brown turbid urine. Laboratory tests at presentation showed acute intravascular hemolysis. Nonoliguric renal failure ensured, and he was transferred to our institution 2 days later. The patient was group A, Rh (D) positive, P1 negative with a cold autoantibody and cold anti-P1 alloantibody. The direct antiglobulin test was negative at the time of transfer. To evaluate the hemolysis, studies were done to test for rifampicin- or isoniazid-dependent antibodies. Rifampicin-dependent antibodies were detected in the antiglobulin phase with broad spectrum anti-human globulin, monospecific anti-gamma chain, and anti-complement antisera. Agglutination titers did not change after dithiothreitol reduction of the patient's serum. We conclude that this patient developed rifampicin-dependent IgG antibodies with complement-fixing capability. The presence of rifampicin-dependent antibodies should be suspected in a patient with hemolysis and/or renal failure taking rifampicin.
Niacin deficiency impairs poly(ADP-ribose) formation and enhances ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-induced carcinogenesis. Previous experiments were compromised by rapid progression of cancer, and the current study was designed with half the number of ENU doses. Weanling male Long-Evans rats were fed niacin deficient (ND), pair-fed (PF) control (30 mg nicotinic acid/kg), or pharmacological niacin (NA; 4 g nicotinic acid/kg) diets. After 2 wk, rats were gavaged every other day with ENU [30 mg/kg body weight (bw)] or vehicle (6 doses). Four days after the last dose of ENU, all rats were switched to AIN-93M diet and mildly feed restricted to maintain a constant food intake per bw. Rats were monitored for termination criteria and assessed for cancer development. Total cancers developed more rapidly in rats on the ND diet compared to those receiving high dose supplements of NA (P = 0.02; Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon test). Importantly, all of these differences occurred in the leukemias, especially the nonlymphocytic leukemia fraction (P = 0.008; Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon test), with incidences of 36%, 17%, and 11% in ND, PF, and NA rats, respectively. Because nonlymphocytic leukemias represent the majority of secondary cancers, these data support the concept that niacin supplementation may help protect cancer patients from the deleterious side effects of chemotherapy.
Virgin female C3H/He mice (275) were fed a ration that included 0.1 per cent N-4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl formamide (FANFT) and retinyl acetate. The mice were divided into five groups with Groups 1 through 4 receiving 300, 600, 1200, and 2400 IU of retinyl acetate per kilogram of feed plus FANFT respectively. Group 5 received 300 IU per kg of feed and no FANFT as a control. After 45 weeks the bladders were removed and inspected for neoplasms. There were no tumors found in any of the mice from Group 5. It was found that retinyl acetate significantly inhibited the formation of squamous cell tumors at all levels and inhibited transitional cell carcinoma when given as 600 IU per kilogram of feed.
In order to characterize the hepatic effects of phenobarbital (PB) and clofibrate (CPIB) in dogs, PB and CPIB were administered to male beagle dogs for 14 days, and biochemical and histopathological examinations and comprehensive genomic and proteomic analyses, including GeneChip analysis and proteomics analysis using the 2-dimension difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) technique, were performed. Both compounds caused centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, which were related to smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) proliferation in PB-treated dogs and to mitochondrial proliferation in CPIB-treated dogs. In the PB-treated dogs, drug-metabolizing enzyme induction was observed by Western blot and genomic analyses. CYP proteins could not be detected by the 2D-DIGE analysis, but increases in several endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related proteins were observed. In the CPIB-treated dogs, drug-metabolizing enzyme induction was not clearly observed by any of Western blot, genomic and proteomic analyses. Genomic and proteomic analyses revealed that mitochondrial genes and proteins, including carnitine palmytoiltransferase II, acyl-CoA deheydrogenase and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase and ATP synthase beta chain were induced. There is a relatively good correlation among the morphology and the genomic and proteomic data, but some differences exist between the genomic and proteomic data. Comprehensive evaluation using these techniques in addition to morphological evaluation may provide a useful tool for safety assessment of the liver.
Bis(alpha-furancarboxylato)oxovanadium(IV) (BFOV) is a new orally active anti-diabetic organic vanadium complex. In the previous studies, we found that BFOV exhibited a glucose-lowering activity following oral administration to type 1-like diabetic mice induced by alloxan and rats induced by streptozotocin, and the mechanism was not related to enhancing the insulin synthesis and secretion. Since the enhancement of insulin sensitivity is involved in one of the mechanisms by which vanadium exerts its anti-diabetic effects, BFOV has been further tested on fat-fed/streptozotocin-treated rats, a type 2-like diabetic animal model, in the present study. The results showed that 4 weeks of BFOV treatment significantly improved hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia, as well as increased insulin sensitivity index in the fat-fed/streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Furthermore, BFOV efficiently activated glucokinase, increased hepatic glycogen content and suppressed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression in the liver and kidney of the diabetic rats, which contributed to augmentation of hepatic glucose disposal and maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis. These findings suggested that BEOV had anti-diabetic and insulin-sensitizing effects in the diabetic rats, exhibiting the potential to be developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Two porphyrin-brucine quaternary ammonium salts were immobilized on gold nanoparticles and their suitability for both in vitro and in vivo photodynamic therapy (PDT) was assayed using the basaloid squamous cell carcinoma PE/CA-PJ34 cell line. In vitro PDT experiments revealed that the gold nanoparticle-bound conjugates were less effective than unbound conjugates in killing cells. However, the same conjugates were more effective in reducing tumor size in vivo, with complete tumor regression observed.
Clozapine treatment of schizophrenia is effective only in 30-60% of individuals. Since genetic factors are believed to play a significant role in the variation of response to antipsychotics, the aim of the present study was to verify the effect of a G-protein gene polymorphism on clozapine response and clozapine-induced generalized seizures in Brazilian patients with schizophrenia.
In total, 121 schizophrenic patients in treatment with clozapine were genotyped for the 825C>T polymorphism it the GNB3 gene using PCR.
Homozygosity for the T825 allele was more frequent among nonresponders (chi(2) = 7.708; p = 0.021), and carriers of this allele had a higher risk to present a convulsion episode (chi(2) = 7.279; p = 0.007). These results were confirmed after controlling for covariates by logistic regression.
Our data suggest an influence of the 825C>T polymorphism on clozapine response in persons with schizophrenia and also on a specific neurological side effect (generalized seizures) under clozapine treatment.
Aberrant activation of Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 signaling pathway is commonly found in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we show that PD-0332991, a highly specific inhibitor for Cdk4 and Cdk6, exerted growth inhibitory effects on three human PDAC cell lines. Microarray analysis revealed that PD-0332991 downregulated cell-cycle-related genes, but upregulated genes implicated in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and pancreatic cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Moreover, PD-0332991 enhanced invasion in TGF-β-responsive PDAC cell lines that harbor a wild-type SMAD4 gene (COLO-357, PANC-1), but not in TGF-β-resistant AsPC-1 cells that harbor a mutated SMAD4. PD-0332991 also induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in COLO-357 and PANC-1, but not in AsPC-1 cells. Inhibition of CDK4/6 using shRNA mimicked the effects of PD-0332991 on EMT induction. Furthermore, PD-0332991 increased Smad transcriptional activity in luciferase readout assays and activated TGF-β signaling. SB-505124, an inhibitor of the type-I TGF-β receptor (TβRI) kinase, completely blocked EMT induction by PD-0332991. When combined with PD-0332991, SB-505124 inhibited the growth of COLO-357 and PANC-1 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that anti-Cdk4/6 therapy could induce EMT and enhance pancreatic cancer cell invasion by activating Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling, and that combining PD-0332991 and SB-505124 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in PDAC.
The association amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is a widely used medication. Only about 15 cases of cholestatic hepatitis were reported in Belgium between 1990 and 1993; about 100 cases have been reported to the pharmaceutical company. This effect is severe but reversible. The injury is probably idiosyncratic or immunologically based. Age, sex and treatment duration are as many agents of risk. The diagnosis is undertaken on basis of clinical examination, chronological study, biological evolution and histology.
The action of phaclofen, the phosphonic acid derivative of baclofen, on baclofen-induced suppression of spinal reflex transmission was tested in anaesthetized rats. Intrathecal (i.th.) injection of phaclofen, 100 nmol, antagonized the depressant effect of baclofen, 2 nmol, on spinal Hoffmann (H)-reflexes and polysynaptic flexor reflexes but ha on the action of muscimol, 20 nmol. The antagonistic effect of phaclofen on baclofen-induced depression of H-reflexes was dose-dependent in doses ranging from 1 to 100 nmol. When administered alone, phaclofen, 100 nmol, was devoid of stimulatory or depressant effects on spinal reflexes. These results indicate that phaclofen specifically antagonizes the reflex suppressant action of baclofen. The lack of intrinsic action of phaclofen suggests that there is no endogenous tonic inhibition mediated by GABAB receptors under the present experimental conditions.
A case of ectasing cholangitis, following intra-arterial chemotherapy with discontinuous infusion of fluorouracile, is described. The severe destruction of the intra-hepatic biliary ducts led to the constitution of large cavities in continuity with the biliary tree. These cavities were responsible for images which were mistakenly thought to be metastases. Consequently, secondary biliary cirrhosis developed, requiring orthotopic liver transplantation.
Capillary leak syndrome is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition caused by a shift of intravascular fluid and proteins to the interstitial space. We describe a patient with pustular psoriasis in whom capillary leak syndrome developed after the start of acitretin. Immediate withdrawal of retinoic acid is necessary and corticosteroid therapy should be considered.
Cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and total blood serotonin levels were measured simultaneously in 11 female patients with delirium tremens and nine schizophrenic women with clozapine-induced acute delirium. Both groups had significantly raised levels of 5HIAA in CSF and significantly reduced blood 5HT levels as compared with normal control subjects, symptom-free alcoholics, or clozapine-treated schizophrenics. The two delirious groups were not distinguishable from each other in respect of their CSF 5HIAA or blood 5HT values. After clinical recovery both values returned to normal levels.
In the last 10 years we have studied 21 adenocarcinomas of the endocervix developing in women up to the age of 50. 16 of these women had taken oral contraceptives (OCs) for an average of 10 years but anywhere from 1-16 years. During the same period of time, we collected 8 adenocarcinomas in situ of the endocervical mucosa, 7 of which developed after 1-20 years of OC use. 10 of 16 patients with adenocarcinomas and 5 of those with adenocarcinomas in situ had taken OCs containing norgestrel. The others had taken either norethisterone acetate or lynestrol. Histologically, 8 of 16 carcinomas were well-differentiated, 5 were mucoepidermoid, and 3 microalveolar adenocarcinomas. In 2 of the 5 patients who had not taken OCs, the adenocarcinomas were well-differentiated, the remaining 3 were poorly differentiated but without mucoepidermoid qualities. In the women taking the OCs, and adenomatous hyperplasia of the endocervix developed either prior to or at the same time as the adenocarcinoma. 8 of 10 rhesus monkeys (NCI) treated every 84-90 days for 10 years with medroxyprogesterone acetate at doses 50 times those prescribed for women developed the same types of adenocarcinomas. These studies strongly suggest the use of gestagens for many years is causally related to the development of these generally rare adenocarcinomas. These results warrant further investigations.

ME3738 (22beta-methoxyolean-12-ene-3beta, 24(4beta)-diol), a derivative of soyasapogenol, attenuates liver disease in several models of chronic liver inflammation. In the present study, we have investigated a protective effect of ME3738 in a typical bile acid-induced cholestatic liver model, lithocholate (LCA) feeding mouse. Co-administration of ME3738 resulted in decreases in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and hepatic bile acid level, and increases in biliary outputs of bile acid and cholesterol, as compared with the results in mice treated with LCA alone. LCA sulfation by hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase 2a and hydroxylation have been reported to be involved in protection against LCA-induced hepatotoxicity. ME3738-treatment, however, had no clear influence on the hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase 2a protein level and LCA 6alpha-, 6beta- and 7alpha-hydroxylase activities, but increased biliary cholesterol output. Cholate (CA)-treatment has been shown to induce hepatotoxicity in farnesoid X receptor-null mice, which is scarcely dependent on bile acid sulfation and hydroxylation but associated with decreased biliary bile acid output. Co-administration of ME3738 decreased the ALT and ALP activities and hepatic bile acid level, and increased biliary outputs of bile acid and cholesterol in farnesoid X receptor-null mice, as compared with the results in the mice treated with CA. Moreover, a clear correlation between biliary outputs of cholesterol and bile acid was observed in these two bile acid-induced hepatotoxicity mouse models. These results suggest that ME3738 protects against bile acid-induced hepatotoxicity through increased biliary bile acid output that is not related to bile acid metabolism but associated with cholesterol output.
Analysis of urinary steroids excreted by a 7-year old girl with low renin hypertension following ACTH treatment revealed several unknown steroids, which have been analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. It is proposed that these steroids are monohydroxylated derivatives of cortisol, cortisone, either or both tetrahydro and allo-tetrahydrocortisol and either or both tetrahydro and allo-tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol. Further analysis indicated that there are two likely positions for the additional hydroxyl group, either on the A or B ring.
