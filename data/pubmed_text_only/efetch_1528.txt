An opioid withdrawal syndrome was induced in rats by repeated morphine administration and final naloxone injection. The withdrawal causes alteration of several physiological signs. The aim of the study was to describe a quantitative opioid abstinence syndrome to validate the methodology by utilizing clonidine, a well-known antiwithdrawal agent, and propose the procedure for the screening of antiabstinence drugs. In particular, rats were treated with saline, morphine, naloxone, morphine and naloxone and four doses of clonidine (0, 0.04, 0.1, and 0.25 mg/kg orally). In rats repeatedly exposed to morphine and then injected with naloxone, signs like excretion of feces and urine, salivation, behavioral jumping and wet dog shakes, rectal temperature, and pain threshold have been observed. Consequently, the objective symptoms observed in morphine plus naloxone-treated animals have been taken as markers of opioid withdrawal. These factors have been quantitatively measured and grouped to form a standardized procedure of opioid abstinence syndrome. In addition, it is possible to observe that the antiabstinence drug clonidine exerted effects on modified physiological signs appearing in morphine-dependent rats treated with naloxone, like fecal excretion, levels of rectal temperature, latency times, salivation as well as jumping behavior. The effects exerted by clonidine in this procedure and in other methods are compared and appear to be similar. In addition, comparative observations referring to both the previous methods and the present procedure related to the type of signs studied, the modality of evaluation, and suppressive activity exerted by the antiwithdrawal agent, clonidine, are performed: the greater accuracy of the proposed method becomes apparent. Thus, this experimental model, validated by the antiabstinence agent clonidine, is proposed as a useful screen for drugs affecting opioid withdrawal syndrome.
Immune complex-mediated vasculitis is a well-recognized form of idiosyncratic drug reaction. We report cutaneous vasculitis in association with therapy with rifampin (rifampicin). To our knowledge, this has not previously been documented. Rifampin is widely used, and such reactions are therefore important to note.
The need and frequency of hepatic biopsies during methotrexate (MTX) therapy are still controversial.
The purpose of this investigation is to assess MTX liver toxicity in patients with psoriasis through percutaneous liver biopsy, and compare liver morphology changes with increasing cumulative dosages (1, 2, 3 and 4 g) of MTX.
Cumulative dosages of 1 to 2 g MTX did not cause significant liver toxicity. From a cumulative dosage of 3 to 4 g, there is fibrosis formation, inflammation enhancement in the portal area and fibrous septa, configuring regenerative nodes.
In patients with no risk factors for liver disease, with normal physical examination and liver tests, biopsy can be done after a cumulative MTX dosage of approximately 1 to 1.5 g and repeated for each gram. In patients with risk factors, liver biopsy should be done before use of MTX, or within the first 2 months of treatment at the most, and repeated for each gram of cumulative dosage.
Serious adverse reactions to ropivacaine and lidocaine are rare. In this report, we describe a case of sudden cardiac arrest after an interscalene brachial plexus block with a mixture of 150 mg of ropivacaine and 360 mg of lidocaine in a previously healthy, 34-year-old, 97-kg man. Severe hypotension occurred after successful resuscitation, necessitating an infusion of epinephrine. The patient developed pulmonary oedema, and was mechanically ventilated for 22 h. He eventually made a good recovery. We conclude that although ropivacaine and lidocaine are often considered relatively safe local anesthetics, serious cardiovascular complications can occur after the use of these drugs.
Urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG-ase) activity is a very sensitive parameter of kidney proximal tubular damage. Using urinary NAG-ase activity/urinary creatinine as the NAG index, the serum methotrexate (MTX) level and urinary pH were investigated simultaneously. These parameters were measured in 17 leukaemic children. During MTX treatment, NAG indices were normal in 5 children and only slightly elevated occasionally in 9 patients. Among them, transiently high serum MTX levels (Patient A) or low urinary pH (Patient B) were accompanied by high NAG indices. MTX toxicity has been diagnosed in 3 cases, when permanently high NAG indices were in accordance with other clinical signs.
TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB play important roles in the development of inflammation in chronic renal failure (CRF). In hepatic cells, curcumin is shown to antagonize TNF-alpha-elicited NF-kappaB activation. In this study, we hypothesized that if inflammation plays a key role in renal failure then curcumin should be effective in improving CRF. The effectiveness of curcumin was compared with enalapril, a compound known to ameliorate human and experimental CRF. Investigation was conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats where CRF was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx). The Nx animals were divided into untreated (Nx), curcumin-treated (curcumin), and enalapril-treated (enalapril) groups. Sham-operated animals served as a control. Renal dysfunction in the Nx group, as evidenced by elevated blood urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine, proteinuria, segmental sclerosis, and tubular dilatation, was significantly reduced by curcumin and enalapril treatment. However, only enalapril significantly improved blood pressure. Compared with the control, the Nx animals had significantly higher plasma and kidney TNF-alpha, which was associated with NF-kappaB activation and macrophage infiltration in the kidney. These changes were effectively antagonized by curcumin and enalapril treatment. The decline in the anti-inflammatory peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) seen in Nx animals was also counteracted by curcumin and enalapril. Studies in mesangial cells were carried out to further establish that the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin in vivo was mediated essentially by antagonizing TNF-alpha. Curcumin dose dependently antagonized the TNF-alpha-mediated decrease in PPARgamma and blocked transactivation of NF-kappaB and repression of PPARgamma, indicating that the anti-inflamatory property of curcumin may be responsible for alleviating CRF in Nx animals.
The sensitivity to the GABA-blocking agent picrotoxin was studied in young and adult male and female rats, in rats treated with gonadal hormones and in gonadectomized male and female rats. Picrotoxin was equipotent in producing convulsions in male and female 20-day-old rats. Adult females tended to be more, while adult males were considerably less sensitive to picrotoxin than young rats. Picrotoxin was equipotent in displacing t-[3H]butylbicycloorthobenzoate ([3H]TBOB) binding to crude cortical and cerebellar membranes from male and female rat brain. Chronic treatment of male rats, beginning with 30 days of age, with estradiol benzoate enhanced their sensitivity to picrotoxin, while an analogous treatment of female rats with testosterone propionate was ineffective. Thirty days following castration adult male rats had shorter latencies to the appearance of picrotoxin-induced convulsions and a higher incidence of death. Ovariectomy in females failed to modify the sensitivity to picrotoxin. The results suggest that gonadal hormones have a crucial role in the development of sex related differences in the response of rats to picrotoxin and presumably to other GABA-related drugs. When developed, the male type of reactivity appears to depend more, and the female type less on the presence of circulating hormones in the blood.
The long-term survival of patients with high-grade gliomas of the CNS is poor despite the use of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In an attempt to improve the survival of such patients, we administered adjuvant chemotherapy as high-dose carmustine with autologous bone marrow transplantation. Eighteen patients, 15 with glioblastoma multiforme and three with anaplastic astrocytoma, were treated shortly after completion of standard radiation therapy. One course of carmustine was administered at a total dose of 900-1050 mg/m2 iv over 3 days followed in 3 days by the reinfusion of the previously cryopreserved bone marrow. Acute toxicity was mild, but eight patients had severe pulmonary or CNS toxicity of which four episodes of pulmonary toxicity were fatal. For all patients treated, the median survival was 17.5 months from diagnosis and the estimated probability of surviving greater than 27 months was 22% (95% confidence limits of 14%-32%). Presently, there are four long-term survivors, two with progressive tumor, one suffering from severe encephalomyelopathy, and one alive and well. Although, in this series, we have observed long-term survivors, the overall estimated probability of survival is not substantially different from conventional treatment. In addition, the 22% incidence of fatal pulmonary toxicity suggests that this treatment will not measurably add to the treatment of CNS gliomas.
Cholangiocarcinoma represents a serious complication of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Ursodeoxycholic acid may possibly influence the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in man. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence rate of cholangiocarcinoma in a large group of primary sclerosing cholangitis patients after long-time treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid.
From May 1987 up to May 2005 a total of 150 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis but without evidence of cholangiocarcinoma at entry were included in the study. All patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and controls were performed in at least yearly intervals.
The median treatment time of the 150 patients was 6.4 years. Altogether five patients developed a cholangiocarcinoma during treatment yielding a rate of 3.3%. The patients developed 0.58 cholangiocarcinoma per 100 patient-years in years 0-2.5, 0.59 cholangiocarcinoma in years 2.5-8.5, and no cholangiocarcinoma thereafter up to 18 years after entry into the study. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of cholangiocarcinoma incidence during ursodeoxycholic acid treatment reached a plateau after 8.3 years.
The annual incidence rate of cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis treated with ursodeoxycholic acid is lower than expected and decreases with time of treatment.
The novel recombinant hirudin analog CX-397 was investigated with respect to its pharmacological activity and antithrombin profiles in vivo and in vitro. In three different types of thrombosis models in rats, including stasis and thrombin-induced venous, glass surface-activated arterio-venous shunt, and ferric chloride-induced arterial thrombosis models, CX-397 and rHV-1 elicited potent antithrombotic effects, where the minimum effective doses of rHV-1 tended to be higher than those of CX-397 in the arterio-venous shunt and arterial thrombosis models. The hemorrhagic risk of CX-397 in template bleeding in rats was not higher than that of rHV-1, indicating that CX-397 is superior to rHV-1 for treating the platelet-dominant type of thrombosis. However, no differences were detected between CX-397 and rHV-1 in their effects on in vitro coagulation times and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, suggesting the possibility that some unknown mechanisms other than simple thrombin inhibition are also involved in their antithrombotic actions.
To test the hypothesis that polymorphisms in antioxidant genes are more susceptible to sperm DNA damage and male infertility, we examined 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from six antioxidant genes (GPX1, CAT, PON1, NQO1, SOD2/MnSOD, and SOD3) in 580 infertility cases and 580 controls from a Chinese population-based case-control study (NJMU Infertility Study). Genotypes were determined using the OpenArray platform. Sperm DNA fragmentation was detected using the Tdt-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and the level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in sperm DNA was measured using immunofluorescence. The adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. The results indicated that the PON1 Arg192Glu (rs662) and SOD2 Val16Ala (rs4880) variant genotypes were associated with a significantly higher risk of male infertility. In addition, subjects carrying variant genotypes of both loci had a twofold (95% CI, 1.42-2.90) increase in the risk of male infertility, indicating a significant gene-gene interaction between these two loci (P for multiplicative interaction=0.045). Moreover, linear regression analysis showed that individuals carrying the PON1 Arg192Glu (rs662) or SOD2 Val16Ala (rs4880) variants have significantly higher levels of sperm DNA fragmentation and 8-OHdG. These data suggest that genetic variations in antioxidant genes may contribute to oxidative sperm DNA damage and male infertility.
To observe the variation of ET and CGRP contents in ischemic heart, and NO level in serum of myocardial damaged rats, and their regulation when with the protection of Xinshuping, a traditional Chinese medicine compound.
The models of myocardial ischemia were prepared by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol or by ligation of coronary artery.
ET content in myocardium was significantly increased (P < 0.01), and CGRP content as well as NO level in serum was not changed obviously in the model induced by isoproterenal. However, NO level in serum of rats treated with Xinshuping (ig bid x 2.5 d) was markedly raised (P < 0.01), neither ET not CGRP contents were affected by it. LDH and CK levels in serum of rats were evidently lowered by Xinshuping treatment. S-T segment's elevation of ECG was significantly inhibited and myocardial infarction size was reduced markedly by Xinshuping treatment in rats subjected to coronary artery ligature.
ET, CGRP or NO is involved in myocardial infarction caused by isoproterenol. The ischemic damage or dysfunction in different models is obviously protected by Xinshuping. The promotion of NO release from vascular endothelium is probably related with this protective effect.
Tirilazad is a membrane lipid peroxidation inhibitor being studied for the management of subarachnoid hemorrhage; phenytoin is used for seizure prophylaxis in the same disorder. The induction of tirilazad clearance by phenytoin was assessed in 12 volunteers (6 male, 6 female). Subjects received phenytoin orally every 8 h for 7 days (200 mg for nine doses and 100 mg for 13 doses) in one phase of a crossover study. In both study phases, 1.5 mg kg-1 tirilazad mesylate was administered by i.v. infusion every 6 h for 29 doses. Tirilazad mesylate and U-89678 (an active metabolite) in plasma were quantified by HPLC. After the final dose, tirilazad clearance was increased by 91.8% in subjects receiving phenytoin + tirilazad versus tirilazad alone. AUC0-6 for U-89678 after the last tirilazad dose was reduced by 93.1% by concomitant phenytoin. These effects were statistically significant. The time course of induction was consistent with that of phenytoin's effect on the ratio of urinary 6 beta-hydroxycortisol to cortisol, a measure of hepatic CYP3A activity. The results show that phenytoin induces metabolism of tirilazad and U-89678 in healthy subjects and that, under these conditions, tirilazad clearance approaches liver blood flow.
To study the therapeutical effect and mechanisms of resveratrol and its combination with praziquantel on the liver fibrosis due to Schistosoma japonicum infection.
Eighty mice infected with 25 S. japonicum cercariae for 6 weeks were randomly divided into four groups named as praziquantel group (A), resveratrol group (B), resveratrol+praziquantel group (C) and infection group (D). Mice in groups A and B were treated with praziquantel [500 mg/(kg x d)] for 2 d, and resveratrol [20 mg/(kg x d)] for 6 weeks, respectively. Mice in group C were treated with resveratrol [20 mg/(kg x d)] for 6 weeks after praziquantel treatment [500 mg/(kg x d)x 2 d]. Group D served as infection control. Twenty normal mice were taken as normal control group (Group E). At the 12th week post-infection, all mice were sacrificed and the liver tissues were removed. Histopathological changes were observed in the liver of all groups. RT-PCR was used to detect the relative VEGF mRNA level in liver tissue. Maleic dialdehyde (MDA) content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in liver were measured by ELISA. The expressions of VEGF, type I and type III collagen were examined by immunohistochemistry.
After treatment, the degrees of liver fibrosis in groups A, B and C decreased. The hepatic expression of VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein levels in groups A (0.37 +/- 0.06, 0.69 +/- 0.42), B (0.23 +/- 0.01, 0.38 +/- 0.42), C (0.11 +/- 0.00, 0.12 +/- 0.17) and E (0.06 +/- 0.03, 0.04 +/- 0.02) were lower than that of group D (0.60 +/- 0.03, 0.97 +/- 0.36) (P < 0.01), those in groups A and B were significantly lower than that of group C (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), and those in group A were lower than in group B (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in liver SOD activity and MDA content between group A(13.56 +/- 2.56, 7.62 +/- 2.30) and group B(14.28 +/- 1.56, 6.63 +/- 2.31)(P > 0.05). Compared with group C (22.36 +/- 1.55, 2.31 +/- 1.31), mice in groups A and B exhibited decreased an SOD activity, but increased MDA content (P < 0.05). SOD activity of groups A, B, and C was higher than that of group D (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and MDA content in the above three groups was lower than that of group D (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).
Resveratrol has an antifibrogenic effect through inhibiting the expression of VEGF and reducing oxidative stress in mice with Schistosoma japonicum egg-induced liver fibrosis. Resveratrol and praziquantel show a synergistic action in antifibrosis treatment.
The aim of this study was to examine the toxicity of formaldehyde (FA) on the kidney and the protective effects of omega-3 essential fatty acids against these toxic effects. Twenty-one male Wistar rats were divided into three groups. Rats in Group I comprised the controls, while the rats in Group II were injected every other day with FA. Rats in Group III received omega-3 fatty acids daily while exposed to FA. At the end of the 14-day experimental period, all rats were killed by decapitation and the kidneys removed. Some of the kidney tissue specimens were used for determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The remaining kidney tissue specimens were used for light microscopic evaluation. The levels of SOD and GSH-Px were significantly decreased, and MDA levels were significantly increased in rats treated with FA compared with those of the controls. Furthermore, in the microscopic examination of this group, glomerular and tubular degeneration, vascular congestion and tubular dilatation were observed. However, increased SOD and GSH-Px enzyme activities, and decreased MDA levels were detected in the rats administered omega-3 fatty acids while exposed to FA. Additionally, kidney damage caused by FA was decreased and structural appearance was similar to that of the control rats in this group. In conclusion, it was determined that FA-induced kidney damage was prevented by administration of omega-3 essential fatty acids.
Tubulointerstitial lesions are important in the progression of proteinuric renal disease. Tubular kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) is induced in acute renal injury and reversible as a natural course. Kim-1 is also present in chronic renal damage; however, the dynamics of Kim-1 in chronic renal damage and effects of antiproteinuric treatment on Kim-1 are unknown. We studied Kim-1 in adriamycin nephrosis (AN) before and after renin-angiotensin system blockade. A renal biopsy was taken 6 wk after adriamycin injection to study renal damage and Kim-1 expression. Subsequently, ACE inhibition (ACEi; n = 23), angiotensin II antagonist (AT(1A); n = 23), or vehicle (n = 10) was given for 6 wk; healthy rats served as controls (CON; n = 8). In AN, renal Kim-1 mRNA was induced 26-fold vs. CON at week 6, with further increase in vehicle to week 12 (40-fold) but was reduced by ACEi and AT(1A) to 10- and 12-fold vs. CON (P < 0.05 vs. week 6). Kim-1 protein was undetectable in CON; in AN, it was present in brush border of dilated tubules in areas with adjacent interstitial lesions. Renal Kim-1 protein levels increased from weeks 6-12 in vehicle and decreased in ACEi- and AT(1A)-treated groups (P < 0.05). In vehicle, urinary Kim-1 was increased (P < 0.05 vs. CON), with a reduction by ACEi and AT(1A) (P < 0.05 vs. vehicle). Renal and urinary Kim-1 correlated with proteinuria and interstitial damage cross-sectionally. Reductions in proteinuria and renal Kim-1 correlated, which was not associated by corresponding changes in tubulointerstitial fibrosis. In conclusion, on longitudinal follow-up during antiproteinuric treatment increased renal Kim-1 expression is reversible in proportion to proteinuria reduction, likely reflecting reversibility of early tubular injury, supporting its potential as a biomarker for tubulointerstitial processes of damage and repair.
Hypoglycemia is suspected in the acute lethal toxicity induced by cutaneous exposure to monochloroacetic acid (MCA). Although it has been shown that hepato-renal dysfunction is involved, the mechanism and the target organs that directly affect mortality remain to be determined. We suspected respiratory failure as a main cause of death in some reported cases. We investigated dose-response effects, hypoglycemia, and lung injury in rats exposed to MCA. Serum glucose, blood gases, and parameters of alveolar injury in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analysed 2 and 4 h after subcutaneous administration of MCA (108, 135 or 163 mg/kg). Apparent pulmonary injury and hypoglycemia were not identified 2 h after administration, but lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total cells in BALF were dose-dependently increased; and severe hypoglycemia was identified 4 h after administration. Blood gas analysis showed remarkable alveolar gas dysfunction as exchange in the 163 mg/kg group. Thus, hypoglycemia and lung injury appear to cause death in response to MCA exposure.
Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) is increasingly being used to reduce spasticity among children with cerebral palsy, dystonia, and spinal cord injuries. However, complications such as withdrawal, which is a potentially life-threatening condition, can occur. Intrathecal baclofen withdrawal should be differentiated with autonomic dysreflexia, malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and serotonin syndrome. We report a case of ITB withdrawal secondary to low residual volume in the pump reservoir and resembling serotonin syndrome in an adolescent with cerebral palsy. He presented with agitation, diaphoresis, increasing spasticity, rigidity, jitteriness, hyperreflexia, clonus, tachycardia, hypertension, and rhabdomyolysis. Treatment consisted of emergent refilling of the pump, intravenous diazepam, and oral cyproheptadine. We also emphasize the importance of prompt recognition of ITB withdrawal among high-risk patients.
Long-term palliative treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with the dopamine precursor l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( l-DOPA, levodopa) is compromised by the occurrence of motor complications, most notably motor fluctuations and involuntary movements, l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of adding the catechol- O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone to chronic treatment with l-DOPA/benserazide. It was hoped that the administration of entacapone would prolong and smooth the central effect of l-DOPA exposure and that this would result in a reduced risk of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia induction by lowering the l-DOPA dose. The rotational response and striatal extracellular dopamine release were assessed in rats that had undergone a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion of the nigro-striatal system. Previous studies have shown that repeated treatment with l-DOPA is accompanied by a marked enhancement in behavioural responses and has pharmacological characteristics similar to l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. In the present study, we demonstrated that rats receiving entacapone in addition to 6.50 mg/kg of l-DOPA displayed significant enhancement of the developing contralateral turning response compared with rats treated with the same dose of l-DOPA only. However, when reducing the l-DOPA dose to 4.25 mg/kg the behavioural response was comparable to that seen in rats treated with the higher dose of l-DOPA only. Voltammetry analysis suggests that the increased behavioural response in entacapone-treated rats is the result of a much larger dopamine release. In addition, we found that entacapone treatment prolonged and smoothed the striatal dopamine levels following chronic l-DOPA/benserazide treatment. From a clinical point of view, this finding suggests that administration of a COMT inhibitor should allow the frequency of l-DOPA administration to decrease and to smooth the brain delivery of the l-DOPA, which in the end should facilitate a reduction in the risk of dyskinesia induction.
The BZ1 (omega 1)-selective compound, zolpidem, is a clinically effective hypnotic drug with a pharmacological profile which differs from those of benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics. Zaleplon (CL 284,846) has recently been described as a hypnotic agent which also has BZ1 (omega 1) receptor selectivity. The pharmacological effects of zolpidem and zaleplon were therefore compared in mice and rats. Both drugs blocked tonic convulsions induced in mice by pentylenetetrazole and electroconvulsive shock and clonic convulsions induced by isoniazid. Zaleplon was more potent than zolpidem but the maximal effect of zolpidem for increasing the latency to isoniazid-induced convulsions was greater than that of zaleplon. Little tolerance developed to the anticonvulsant effect of zaleplon against isoniazid-induced seizures following twice daily administration of 10 or 30 mg/kg for 10 days. Both compounds reduced locomotor activity and produced motor deficits in the rotarod and loaded grid tests in mice. However, while zaleplon produced all three effects at similar doses, zolpidem showed the greatest potency for reducing locomotion. Zaleplon and zolpidem also decreased locomotion and produced a rotarod deficit in rats. Again, the difference between the doses giving rise to these two effects was greater for zolpidem than for zaleplon. In a drug discrimination procedure using rats trained to discriminate a dose (5 mg/kg) of chlordiazepoxide, zaleplon produced partial substitution for chlordiazepoxide at doses which greatly reduced response rates. These results show that zaleplon and zolpidem have similar pharmacological profiles, presumably related to their BZ1 (omega 1) receptor selectivity. However, the difference between doses producing motor deficits (rotarod, loaded grid) and those giving rise to other effects (anticonvulsant, decreased locomotion) was greater for zolpidem than for zaleplon. This difference may be related to a greater in vivo intrinsic activity of zolpidem as indicated by the different efficacies of the two drugs to antagonise isoniazid-induced convulsions.
Some antiretrovirals has been reported to cause a wide range of psychiatric symptoms. However, reappearance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms has not been described in relation to these medications.
Case report.
The Boston Medical Center, a tertiary care academic centre.
Two HIV-infected refugees re-experienced symptoms of PTSD after starting therapy with efavirenz (EFV) and zidovudine (ZDV). The two patients had no typical factors present to account for the PTSD exacerbation. In both patients, the symptoms of PTSD gradually subsided to baseline within the first 4 weeks of antiretroviral treatment.
We believe that EFV, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with ZDV, may be manifesting its known neuropsychiatric toxicities in a heretofore unreported presentation of PTSD exacerbation.
To investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Yishenqing on rabbit membranous nephropathy.
The rabbit membranous nephropathy model was induced by cationic bovine serum albumin, and the immunity of mice together with urine volume and haemorheological property of rats were also estimated.
Yishenqing could significantly reduce the urinary protein content, preserve the renal function and pathologically restore the glomeruli. Moreover, its effects also include immunity enhancement, diuretic property and blood stasis amelioration.
Yishenqing has good effects on the rabbit membranous nephropathy, which is probably due to the effects of diuretic property, immunity enhancement and blood stasis amelioration.
Due to their complex and not fully known etiopathogenesis as well as difficulties in treatment, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis still remain one of the main problems of hepatologists. Nowadays, the use of IFN alpha is considered the most effective method of treatment in chronic hepatitis. Recently, a new property of IFN, i.e. its effects on the reduction of fibrosis, has been discovered. The aim of the paper was to examine the effects of IFN alpha on biochemical parameters (AlAt and AspAt activities), on the metabolic function of the liver and its morphologic picture observed under the light and electron microscope after the 3- and 6-week CCl4-induced damage. The experiments were carried out in Wistar male rats. To evaluate the liver function, the test of aminophenazone elimination in the isolated perfused rat livers was used according to Miller modified by Hafte. Additionally, AspAt and AlAt activities were determined. The liver specimens were analysed under the light and electron microscope and using immunohistochemical methods. The findings show that after the 3-week CCl4-induced liver damage, IFN alpha does not significantly affect AlAt and AspAt activities, irrespective of the dose used. IFN alpha administered after the 6-week damage significantly changes those activities when the doses used are high. It was found that carbon tetrachloride does not result in evident cirrhotic changes, however it activates Ito cells, causes focal retraction of the stroma and fibrosis. The increased number of Ito cells in Disse's space observed in immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examinations is indicative of the activation of liver fibrotic processes following CCl4 administration in both variants used. IFN alpha substantially weakens fibrogenesis of the CCl4-damaged liver which is visible in the decreased number of Ito cells and weaker expression of the stroma retraction. Moreover, IFN alpha administered to the experimental animals after the CCl4-induced injury of the liver increases aminophenazone clearance, especially when used in higher doses. Positive effects of IFN confirmed in the studies suggest that the drug may be used in patients with chronic hepatitis and early cirrhosis since it is likely not only to eliminate the virus but also to improve the liver function and reduce fibrosis.
The present study reports the antioxidant activity of Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), family Elaegnaceae, on chromium induced oxidative stress in male albino rats. Oxidative stress was induced in the rats by force-feeding of potassium dichromate equivalent to a dose of 30mg/kg body weight (BW) of chromium(VI) for 30 days. Administration of chromium decreased the body weight and increased organ to body weight ratio significantly. Chromium treatment significantly decreased reduced glutathione (GSH), and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels; further it also enhanced glutamate oxaloacetate transferase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transferase (GPT) levels in the serum. Different doses of the alcoholic leaf extract of Seabuckthorn were evaluated for the protection against the chromium induced oxidative stress. The results show that the leaf extract at a concentration of 100 and 250mg/kg BW protected the animals from the chromium induced oxidative injury significantly.
This report describes a 46-year-old Japanese diabetic woman with an unusual type of familial partial lipodystrophy. She has marked loss of subcutaneous fat in her lower limbs and buttocks, with sparing of the face, neck, upper limbs, and trunk. This distribution of fat atrophy appears to be rare in comparison with previous reports. Sequencing of candidate genes LMNA, PPARG, AKT2, caveolin-1, as well as the PPARG4 promoter gene, which are known to be associated with familial partial lipodystrophy, revealed no genetic abnormalities, suggesting that this case may involve a novel gene. Pioglitazone was markedly effective in glycemic control in this case. Her diabetes remained uncontrolled despite a total daily dose of insulin of 30 U and combined treatment with 10 mg of glibenclamide and 0.6 mg of voglibose. We therefore attempted combined treatment with 30 mg of pioglitazone and 30 U/d insulin injection. The hemoglobin A(1c) level was reduced from 11.2% to 6.1% after 6 months of treatment and has since remained stable. Her body weight increased from 62.0 to 71.0 kg after 12 months of treatment, suggesting that weight gain may result from synergism between thiazolidinediones and insulin-promoting adipogenesis. Pioglitazone increased the fat mass in the upper limbs and trunk, while inducing less increase in the lower limbs, where fat atrophy exists in this patient. Pioglitazone may thus have improved the glycemic control in this case through adipocyte differentiation from progenitor cells mainly in the upper limbs and trunk.
Twenty-one patients developed Raynaud's phenomenon during treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. The vasospastic symptoms were obviously related to the treatment, but their pathogenesis is still controversial. A decrease in cardiac output might explain the phenomenon. According to our very preliminary data an alpha-adrenergic dominance caused by a direct effect on the peripheral circulation seems more probable. Vasospastic symptoms may arise after treatment with both cardioselective and non-selective beta blocking agents. Cautious prescription of beta blocking drugs to patients with preexisting peripheral vascular disease is recommended.
