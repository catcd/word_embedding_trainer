Mucosal leishmaniasis as an oral disease in the form of chronic periodontitis with involvement of the oral mucosa is described. Leishmania parasites were isolated from the oral lesions, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. The patient had a low-grade fever and hepatosplenomegaly that regressed along with the oral lesions after treatment with stibogluconate sodium.
This trial was conducted to determine the incidence of seizures associated with the use of bupropion.
A total of 3341 depressed patients from 102 sites were enrolled in this 8-week, prospective, open trial. Following the 8-week treatment phase, patients could elect to enroll in a humanitarian continuation phase of unlimited duration. Dosing was initiated at 225 mg/day and increased to 450 mg/day as tolerated. Investigators carefully monitored seizure occurrences and rated their patients' response to and tolerance of bupropion.
A total of 1986 patients (61%) completed the 8-week treatment phase, and 1616 (81%) of these elected to be maintained on bupropion treatment in the humanitarian continuation phase. The observed seizure rate was 0.24% for the treatment phase and 0.40% for the entire study. An 8-week survival analysis performed on patients with a dosing regimen of 300 to 450 mg/day yielded a cumulative rate of 0.36%. Patients, including those previously resistant to antidepressant treatment, responded to and tolerated bupropion well.
These rates confirm earlier seizure estimates and fall within accepted parameters for antidepressant drugs. This trial enhances bupropion's position as a valuable alternative for the management of depression.
Painful ejaculation associated with tricyclic antidepressants is rarely reported in the medical literature.
Painful ejaculation following the administration of imipramine and clomipramine is described in four patients.
The phenomenon occurred in all patients during the first 3 weeks of treatment and disappeared within several days when the tricyclic dosage was reduced or the medication was withdrawn.
Painful ejaculation was apparently evoked by tricyclic antidepressant administration. Clinicians should be aware of this underreported side effect.
Eleven patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and three patients with Hodgkin's disease were observed among 876 anti-HIV-positive subjects attending the AIDS clinic at the University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. Compared to the general population this represents a 50-fold (95% confidence limits: 25-90) increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and an 11.4-fold (2.3-33) increased risk for Hodgkin's disease in anti-HIV-positive men. High malignancy, advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, and extranodal localization are characteristic of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in AIDS patients, which carries a poor prognosis. However, remissions and prolonged disease-free survival are possible in individual cases. Only one opportunistic infection was observed during 92 months of treatment and observation using a mild chemotherapeutic regimen (m-BACOD). Less myelosuppressive chemotherapeutic schedules appear to be more beneficial than aggressive regimens in anti-HIV-positive patients due to the lower incidence of opportunistic infections.
Homocysteine (Hcy) at elevated levels is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Hcy on the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in murine macrophages. Among the MMP known to regulate the activities of collagenase and gelatinase, Hcy exclusively increased the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in J774A.1 cells as well as in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, this activity was found to be correlated with Western blot findings in J774A.1 cells, which showed that MMP-9 expression was concentration- and time-dependently increased by Hcy. Inhibition of the ERK and Akt pathways led to a significant decrease in Hcy-induced MMP-9 expression, and combined treatment with inhibitors of the ERK and Akt pathways showed an additive effects. Activity assays for ERK and Akt showed that Hcy increased the phosphorylation of both, but these phosphorylation were not affected by inhibitors of the Akt and ERK pathways. In line with these findings, the molecular inhibition of ERK and Akt using siRNA did not affect the Hcy-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest that Hcy enhances MMP-9 production in murine macrophages by separately activating the ERK and Akt signaling pathways.
During carotid endarterectomy (CEA), phenylephrine infusions are commonly used to induce hypertension during carotid clamping in an attempt to increase collateral cerebral blood flow and prevent cerebral ischemia. Although this practice appears to increase the incidence of intraoperative myocardial ischemia during CEA when general anesthesia is employed, whether the limited use of phenylephrine infusions in specific instances of cerebral ischemia, as shown on an electro-encephalogram, results in low perioperative rates of both myocardial infarction (MI) and cerebral infarction remains unclear. We studied 171 CEAs done under general anesthesia performed with selective shunting based on the identification of cerebral ischemia by a two-channel computerized electroencephalographic monitor. The use of a phenylephrine infusion was restricted to the following instances of cerebral ischemia: 1) ischemia associated with hypotension that did not resolve within 2 minutes of decreases in anesthetic administration and treatment with fluid and/or colloid; 2) ischemia poorly or slowly responsive to shunt placement, accompanied by either hypo- or normotension; and 3) ischemia poorly or slowly responsive to removal of the carotid clamp, accompanied by either hypo- or normotension. Two non-Q wave MIs (1.2%) occurred, both nonfatal. There were two cerebral infarctions (1.2%) and three deaths not related to MI (1.8%). Based on these findings, in order to decrease the incidence of both MI and cerebral infarction after general anesthesia for CEA, we recommend the restrictive use of phenylephrine-induced hypertension for specific instances of slowly or poorly reversible cerebral ischemia, as shown on the electroencephalogram.
Angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred after administration of oral dipyridamole in four patients awaiting urgent myocardial revascularization procedures. To our knowledge, this has not previously been reported as a side effect of preoperative dipyridamole therapy, although dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia has been demonstrated to occur in animals and humans with coronary artery disease. Epicardial coronary collateral vessels were demonstrated in all four patients; a coronary "steal" phenomenon may be the mechanism of the dipyridamole-induced ischemia observed.
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an enzyme that catalyzes degradation of the heme and regulates its availability for newly synthetized hemeproteins such as cyclooxygenases, NO synthases and cytochrome P450. Moreover, HO-1 activity modulates synthesis of cytokines and prostaglandins. All of these factors are well-defined components of fever and pyrogenic tolerance mechanisms. We examine the effect of HO-1 induction and activation using cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) on changes in body temperature (Tb), plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) and HO-1 protein in the course of these processes. Intraperitoneally (i.p.) pre-treatment of rats with CoPP (5 mg kg(-1)) significantly accelerated and enhanced the early stage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced fever and shortened a post-fever recovery to normal temperature. Pre-treatment with CoPP significantly potentiated the increase in plasma IL-6, PGE₂ and HO-1 levels measured 4h after the LPS administration. Furthermore, induction of HO-1 attenuated the development of pyrogenic tolerance to repeated injections of LPS. Based on these data we conclude that heme oxygenase-1 may act as a physiological regulator of the febrile response intensity to bacterial infections.
In two experiments, a recognition test for an earlier presented list was given twice in immediate succession (Test 1 and Test 2). On the hypothesis that anterograde amnesia for episodic memory involves a deficit in contextual memory, amnesic subjects should confuse familiarity with distractor items gained during Test 1 with familiarity gained during original list presentation. As a result, they should think that they recognize more items on Test 2. This will lower recognition efficiency in Test 2 by increasing false alarms rather than by reducing hits. For subjects with an amnesia induced by lorazepam, but not for control subjects, recognition efficiency was substantially reduced in Test 2 in both experiments. As predicted, this impairment was due to a large increase in false alarms, with no decrease in the number of hits. The impairment could not be explained by a difference in recognition level between lorazepam and control subjects on Test 1. These findings therefore support the contextual memory deficit hypothesis of anterograde amnesia. Their implications for understanding the relationship between recall and recognition in amnesia are discussed.
Acute intoxication by tributyltin compounds has been known to induce olfactory disturbances, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study investigates the acute effect of tributyltin chloride (TBTC) on the olfactory bulb in rats. The time-course characteristics of the intra-olfactory concentration of TBTC, the histopathological changes of the olfactory bulb and the olfactory function were examined for 96 h after a single intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 mg/kg of TBTC. The olfactory function was evaluated by the discriminating ability for a cycloheximide solution which has an unpleasant odor for rats. The concentration of TBTC in the olfactory bulb, which was measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, quickly increased to a peak value within 24 h and then decreased. The viable cell number significantly decreased after the TBTC administration in the mitral cell layer and granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb, while apoptotic cells significantly increased in these areas at the same time. Hyposmia was evident 96 h after the TBTC injection, although olfactory testing could not been performed until that time because of anorexia. These results suggest that intraperitoneally injected TBTC was promptly transferred to the olfactory bulb through the blood-brain barrier, induced apoptosis of the cells in the olfactory bulb and finally elicited the olfactory disturbance.
Authors in six patients with liver injury (three of them acute--intoxication with carbon tetrachloride, halothane-hepatitis and acute alcoholic liver disease--and three cases of chronic liver lesions--two chronic alcoholic liver disease and one chronic agressive hepatitis) in the biopsy specimens-in the small number of hepatocytes--electronmicroscopically observed needle-like or quadrate "crystals" of the size of 0.4--3.5 X 0.07--0.2 microns, which seemed to be optically leer. The electronoptical density of the contours of the inclusions is different. To establish the composition of these inclusions electronihistochemical examinations are needed. Morphologically they seem to be similar to cholesterol crystals.
Obesity is associated with strong risks of development of chronic inflammatory liver disease and metabolic syndrome following a second hit. This study tests the hypothesis that free radical metabolism of low chronic exposure to bromodichloromethane (BDCM), a disinfection byproduct of drinking water, causes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), mediated by cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2E1 and adipokine leptin. Using diet-induced obese mice (DIO), mice deficient in CYP2E1, and mice with spontaneous knockout of the leptin gene, we show that BDCM caused increased lipid peroxidation and increased tyrosine nitration in DIO mice, events dependent on reductive metabolism by CYP2E1. DIO mice, exposed to BDCM, exhibited increased hepatic leptin levels and higher levels of proinflammatory gene expression and Kupffer cell activation. Obese mice exposed to BDCM also showed profound hepatic necrosis, Mallory body formation, collagen deposition, and higher alpha smooth muscle actin expression, events that are hallmarks of NASH. The absence of CYP2E1 gene in mice that were fed with a high-fat diet did not show NASH symptoms and were also protected from hepatic metabolic alterations in Glut-1, Glut-4, phosphofructokinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expressions (involved in carbohydrate metabolism), and UCP-1, PGC-1α, SREBP-1c, and PPAR-γ genes (involved in hepatic fat metabolism). Mice lacking the leptin gene were significantly protected from both NASH and metabolic alterations following BDCM exposure, suggesting that higher levels of leptin induction by BDCM in the liver contribute to the development of NASH and metabolic alterations in obesity. These results provide novel insights into BDCM-induced NASH and hepatic metabolic reprogramming and show the regulation of obesity-linked susceptibility to NASH by environmental factors, CYP2E1, and leptin.
Noninvasive vaginal infections by Staphylococcus aureus strains producing the superantigen TSST-1 can cause menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS). With the objective of exploring the basis for differential susceptibility to mTSS, the relative responsiveness to TSST-1 of healthy women has been investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were incubated with purified TSST-1 or with the T-cell mitogen phytohemmaglutinin (PHA), and proliferation was measured. The concentrations of TSST-1 and PHA required to elicit a response equivalent to 15% of the maximal achievable response (EC15) were determined. Although with PHA, EC15 values were comparable between donors, subjects could be classified as being of high, medium, or low sensitivity based on responsiveness to TSST-1. Sensitivity to TSST-1-induced proliferation was associated with increased production of the cytokines interleukin-2 and interferon-γ. When the entire T lymphocyte population was considered, there were no differences between sensitivity groups with respect to the frequency of cells known to be responsive to TSST-1 (those bearing CD3(+) Vβ2(+)). However, there was an association between sensitivity to TSST-1 and certain HLA-class II haplotypes. Thus, the frequencies of DR7DQ2, DR14DQ5, DR4DQ8, and DR8DQ4 haplotypes were greater among those with high sensitivity, a finding confirmed by analysis of responses to immortalized homozygous B cell lines. Collectively, the results reveal that factors other than neutralizing antibody and the frequency of Vβ2(+) T lymphocytes determine immunological responsiveness to TSST-1. Differential responsiveness of lymphocytes to TSST-1 may form the basis of interindividual variations in susceptibility to mTSS.
Using two-stage coronary ligation-, digitalis-, and adrenaline-induced canine ventricular arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic effects of cibenzoline were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each arrhythmia model was determined. Cibenzoline suppressed all the arrhythmias, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, digitalis, and adrenaline were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SDM, n = 6-7). The concentration for adrenaline-induced arrhythmia was significantly higher than those for the other types of arrhythmias. This pharmacological profile is similar to those of mexiletine and tocainide, and all three drugs have central nervous system (CNS) stimulant action. Because cibenzoline had only weak hypotensive and sinus node depressive effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation arrhythmia dogs, its clinical usefulness is expected.
Pregnenolone sulphate (PREGS) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory-enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies, with particular importance in the ageing process. The mechanism by which this endogenous steroid enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems. This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and a negative modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the amnesic-like effects of NMDAR and GABA(A)R ligands. To investigate this hypothesis, the present study in rats examined the memory-altering abilities of structural analogs of PREGS, which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and/or GABA(A)R function. The analogs tested were: 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate (an agent that is inactive at GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs), epipregnanolone ([3beta-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one] sulphate, an inhibitor of both GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs), and a newly synthesized (-) PREGS enantiomer (which is identical to PREGS in effects on GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs). The memory-enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine-induced amnesia. Both PREGS and its (-) enantiomer blocked the effects of scopolamine. The results show that, unlike PREGS, 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine, suggesting that altering the modulation of NMDA receptors diminishes the memory-enhancing effects of PREGS. Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine-induced amnesia. These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive steroids.
A 30 mg/kg (2-gm) intravenous bolus of bretylium tosylate was administered to a patient with recurrent ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. After successful defibrillation the patient exhibited marked hypertension followed by protracted refractory hypotension. There was no further ventricular ectopy in spite of a very low cardiac index. A bretylium level of 8,800 ng/ml is the highest reported in man from a single bolus injection. This case demonstrates the exaggerated hemodynamic response to massive intravenous bolus bretylium tosylate.
Review of the frequency, clinical and biological features and treatment of type II heparin-induced thrombocyopenia.
Case report and literature review.
A 65 years old woman received as antithrombotic prophylaxis low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after prosthetic knee replacement. Day 8, asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis was discovered after systematic echodoppler examination. Curative anticoagulation was started with LMWH. A fall in the platelet count (17 G/L) was noted day 12. Danaparoid was immediately introduced and heparin discontinued. However, day 16 a massive pulmonary embolism occurred which required transfer to an intensive care unit. Danaparoid was changed for lepirudin the same day. It took longer than three weeks for platelet count to return to normal value after heparin discontinuation. The suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocyopenia was confirmed by specific tests.
HIT type II are rare but life-threatening and thrombosis events are the most frequent complications. The diagnosis is a high probability proved by both clinical and biological patterns. The treatment consists in alternative thrombin inhibitors such as danaparoid and lepirudin. The platelet count usually requires less than ten days to recover normal values after heparin withdrawal. Cases in which the delay to a normal platelet count exceeds 3 weeks have been reported specially after LMWH therapy.
Type II HIT are rare but life-threatening events can occur. The platelet count check-up during heparin therapy must be systematic.
The Ah receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates a pleiotropic response to environmental contaminants such as benzo[a]pyrene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. In an effort to gain insight into the physiological role of the AHR and to develop models useful in risk assessment, gene targeting was used to inactivate the murine Ahr gene by homologous recombination. Ahr-/- mice are viable and fertile but show a spectrum of hepatic defects that indicate a role for the AHR in normal liver growth and development. The Ahr-/- phenotype is most severe between 0-3 weeks of age and involves slowed early growth and hepatic defects, including reduced liver weight, transient microvesicular fatty metamorphosis, prolonged extramedullary hematopoiesis, and portal hypercellularity with thickening and fibrosis.
A rat model of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy was elaborated. Adriamycin (ADR) in three total doses 21, 25 and 30 mg/kg ip injected in 15 equal partial doses caused the loss in body weight and hematocrite values, marked leucopenia and moderate elevation of SGOT activities as well as ECG changes. In histopathological examination cardiomyopathic changes were found in heart samples from rats treated with two higher ADR doses. The dose 25 mg/kg is suggested for further investigations concerning the limitation of ADR toxicity.
Methylene blue (MB) is a diaminophenothiazine with potent antioxidant and unique redox properties that prevent morphologic degenerative changes in the mouse retina induced by rotenone, a specific mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. This study evaluated pigmented rats to determine whether MB's neuroprotective effects against rotenone-mediated retinal neurotoxicity have functional relevance and whether these effects are mediated by an improvement in neuronal energy metabolism in vivo. Visual function was behaviorally assessed by determining differences in the illuminance sensitivity threshold pre- and post-bilateral intravitreal injection of rotenone (200 microg/kg) or rotenone plus MB (70 microg/kg). Retinal degeneration was morphologically studied using unbiased stereological tools. Changes in histochemically determined cytochrome oxidase activity in the visual pathway were used to evaluate the impact of treatments on neuronal energy metabolism. Rotenone induced a 1.4 log unit increase in the illumination threshold compared to baseline, as well as a 32% decrease in ganglion cell layer cell (GCL) density, and a 56% decrease in GCL layer + nerve fiber layer thickness. Co-administration of MB prevented the changes in visual function and the retinal histopathology. Furthermore, rotenone induced a functional deafferentation of the visual system, as revealed by decreases in the metabolic activity of the retina, superior colliculus, and visual cortex. These metabolic changes were also prevented by MB. The results provided the first demonstration of MB's behavioral and metabolic neuroprotection against optic neuropathy, and implicate MB as a candidate neuroprotective agent with metabolic-enhancing properties that may be used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.
Nineteen-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome following treatment of arthritis using sulindac. Involvements of infectious and malignant diseases have been ruled out and sulindac has strongly been suspected as a causative agent for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Ten out of 13 cases with Stevens-Johnson syndrome associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sulindac has been administrated. Four cases also presented with severe liver disease. Patients who developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome following sulindac administration did not have apparent common clinical or laboratory findings which might be implicated for development of this severe side effects. Among the various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, safety of sulindac has widely been appreciated. However, occurrence of severe adverse events as reported here indicated that sulindac should be administrated as carefully as other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Two patients, one with and one without preexisting conduction system abnormalities, were treated with amiodarone for refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Electrophysiologic testing before and during amiodarone therapy revealed amiodarone-induced HV interval prolongation and second degree intra-His Wenckebach block with no change in QRS configuration during atrial pacing at relatively long cycle lengths. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is unclear. These cases illustrate that amiodarone can induce distal conduction system block even in the absence of clinical conduction system disease in a pattern that mimics atrioventricular nodal block.
Immortalization (senescence bypass) is a critical rate-limiting step in the malignant transformation of mammalian somatic cells. Human cells must breach at least two distinct senescence barriers to permit unfettered clonal evolution during cancer development: (1) stress- or oncogene-induced premature senescence (SIPS/OIS), mediated via the p16-Rb and/or ARF-p53-p21 tumour-suppressive pathways, and (2) replicative senescence triggered by telomere shortening. In contrast, because their telomerase is constitutively active, cells from small rodents possess only the SIPS/OIS barrier, and are therefore useful for studying SIPS/OIS bypass in isolation. Dermal fibroblasts from the Syrian hamster (SHD cells) are exceptionally resistant to spontaneous SIPS bypass, but it can be readily induced following exposure to a wide range of chemical and physical carcinogens. Here we show that a spectrum of carcinogen-specific mutational and epigenetic alterations involving the INK4A (p16), p53 and INK4B (p15) genes are associated with induced SIPS bypass. With ionizing radiation, immortalization is invariably accompanied by efficient biallelic deletion of the complete INK4/CDKN2 locus. In comparison, SHD cells immortalized by the powerful polycyclic hydrocarbon carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene display transversion point mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 coupled with INK4 alterations such as loss of expression of p15. Epimutational silencing of p16 is the primary event associated with immortalization by nickel, a human non-genotoxic carcinogen. As SIPS/OIS bypass is a prerequisite for the immortalization of normal diploid human epithelial cells, our results with the SHD model will provide a basis for delineating combinations of key molecular changes underpinning this important event in human carcinogenesis.
Gravid rats were treated with methadone, 10 mg/kg/day, or vehicle, from day 5 of gestation to term. The offspring were nursed by foster mothers receiving either methadone or vehicle to form 4 groups: (A) methadone during gestation and lactation, (B) methadone during gestation, (C) methadone during lactation, and (D) no drug treatment. Brain monoamines and metabolites were examined at 21 days of age and found to be decreased in groups A and B. Animals treated comparably to group B and sacrificed at 90 days of age showed no abnormalities in brain monoamines excepting a decrease in dopamine metabolites in limbic areas. Another group treated in utero with methadone was tested at 90 days fo age for shuttle-box avoidance acquisition using massed trials. Methadone-exposed subjects exhibited more avoidances, escapes and intertrial shuttles than controls by the third day of training. These results suggest that subtle but lasting changes in limbic dopamine functions as a consequence of fetal exposure to methadone may make rats hyper-responsive in a massed-trial avoidance procedure in the shuttle-box.
The main injuries among victims of the terrorist act in the Tokyo subway resulted from sub-lethal inhalation and whole body exposure to sarin vapor. In order to study the long term effects of such exposure and to simulate these conditions, freely moving rats were exposed to sarin vapor (27.2±1.7 μg/l) for 10 min. About 50% of the rats showed no overt symptoms and the rest had mild to moderate clinical symptoms that subsided within 4h following exposure. A reduction of weight was noted during the first 3 days with full recovery on the 4th day. Rat's heart was challenged with epinephrine 1 and 6 months post exposure. A significant reduction in the threshold for epinephrine-induced arrhythmia (EPIA) was noted in rats exposed to sarin. A time dependent increase in the kD and Bmax values of muscarinic auto receptors (M2) was recorded in the rat's cortex and striatum. No changes were recorded in the rats' brain trans locator protein (TSPO) levels, concomitant with no observed changes in the animals' performance in A Morris water maze test. A significant increase in open field activity was noted 6 months following exposure to sarin vapor as well as a significant decrease in prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) production in the brain. It is speculated that down regulation of the M2 auto receptor function, caused hyper reactivity of the cholinergic system which leads to the changes described above. The continuous reduction in M2 auto-receptor system through an unknown mechanism may be the cause for long lasting decline in sarin-exposed casualties' health.
