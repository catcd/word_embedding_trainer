The toxic effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during development has been widely investigated. While it has been shown that these drugs impair central nervous development and compromise the neural activity, the effects of these substances on the development of peripheral nerves are still not clarified. In the present study, sciatic nerves withdrawn from three experimental groups of 4-week-old rats, prenatally exposed to either saline solution, or diclofenac sodium, and controls not exposed to any substance, were evaluated in terms of axon number, cross-sectional area of axon and myelin sheet thickness as well as of the ultrastructure of nerve fibers. Comparisons of stereological estimations among these three groups showed that axon number and mean axon cross-sectional area, but not average myelin sheet thickness, were significantly decreased in rats that were exposed to both diclofenac sodium and also to the saline solution, in comparison of the control group. Electron microscope analysis revealed, in both treated groups, deterioration of myelin sheaths that was more pronounced in rats that were exposed to diclofenac sodium. Altogether, these findings show that the prenatal administration of both diclofenac sodium and saline solution impairs peripheral nervous system development, thus suggesting that this potential teratogenic effect should be also taken into consideration in the clinical use of these substances in pregnant patients.
Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) detoxifies oxon derivatives of some organophosphate (OP) pesticides, and its genetic polymorphisms influence enzyme activity and quantity. We previously reported that maternal urinary concentrations of dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites, a marker of OP pesticide exposure, were related to poorer mental development and maternally reported symptoms consistent with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) in 2-year-olds participating in the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study.
We determined whether PON1 genotypes and enzyme measurements were associated with child neurobehavioral development and whether PON1 modified the association of in utero exposure to OPs (as assessed by maternal DAPs) and neurobehavior.
We measured DAP concentrations in maternal urine during pregnancy, PON1₁₉₂ and PON1₋₁₀₈ genotypes in mothers and children, and arylesterase (ARYase) and paraoxonase (POase) in maternal, cord, and 2-year-olds' blood. We assessed 353 2-year-olds on the Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and queried their mothers on the Child Behavior Checklist to obtain a score for PDD.
Children with the PON1(-108T) allele had poorer MDI scores and somewhat poorer PDI scores. Children were less likely to display PDD when they or their mothers had higher ARYase activity and when their mothers had higher POase activity. The association between DAPs and MDI scores was strongest in children with PON1(-108T) allele, but this and other interactions between DAPs and PON1 polymorphisms or enzymes were not significant.
PON1 was associated with child neurobehavioral development, but additional research is needed to confirm whether it modifies the relation with in utero OP exposure.
A comparative survey of delayed adverse reactions (DARs) to ionic and nonionic contrast media (CM) was carried out. In Japan high osmolar CM have mostly been replaced by new low osmolar CM. Therefore, a retrospective survey was performed limited to inpatients who had received an enhanced CT examination in our hospital. The material consists of 715 consecutive cases given ionic CM (iothalamate and diatrizoate) and 902 given nonionic CM (iopamidol and iohexol). DARs were picked up based on descriptions in the medical record up to 5 days after the examination. Most DARs had occurred within two days after the examination. Overall DARs were noted in 36 cases (5.0%) of the ionic group, and 44 cases (4.9%) of the nonionic group. Skin rash as well as other symptoms revealed no significant difference in incidence between the ionic and the nonionic group. There were no significant associations with immediate reactions, allergy, previous adverse reactions to CM. One patient given an ionic CM developed hypotension (60 mmHg) after return to the ward. It should be emphasized that a delayed shock had been recorded.
Desflurane causes dose-dependent decreases in cerebrovascular resistance and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), suggesting that desflurane is a cerebral arteriolar dilator with global flow-metabolism coupling similar to halothane and isoflurane. Desflurane is also similar to isoflurane in that cerebrovascular responsivity to carbon dioxide appears to be maintained. In the dog, arterial hypotension to 40 mm Hg induced with 2.4 MAC desflurane resulted in global decreases in cerebral blood flow of 60% and CMRO2 of 20%. Concentrations of cerebral metabolites of high-energy phosphates were not significantly deranged. The intracranial pressure data from humans are controversial. Desflurane and oxygen at 1 MAC caused sustained increases in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (maximum of 19 +/- 6 mm Hg) in patients undergoing craniotomy for mass lesion, despite prior establishment of hypocapnia. In a more recent study, the same investigators reported similar cerebrospinal fluid pressures before and after 0.5 MAC of either isoflurane or desflurane in 50% N2O. The electroencephalographic effects of desflurane are similar to those of isoflurane in humans, and burst suppression is easily achieved. There are no data available concerning possible interactions between desflurane and the outcome of a cerebral ischemic event. Similar to other potent volatile agents, desflurane can cause cerebral vasodilation and may result in intracranial pressure changes in vulnerable patients, but if adequate hyperventilation and depth of anesthesia are maintained, it is probably safe to use desflurane in a manner similar to isoflurane in patients with decreased intracranial compliance.
To explore the dynamic changes and interactions between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 during experimental liver fibrosis.
Wistar rats were randomly allocated into a normal group and a model group. To induce liver fibrosis, rats were injected intraperitoneally with dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) three consecutive times in the first week, then two consecutive times per week, totally for 6 weeks. In the normal control group, rats were injected with saline by the same method as the model group. Animals were sacrificed 1, 4, 10, 17, 28, 42, 56 days after starting DMN injections. Conventional histological examinations of the livers were performed with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson staining. The fibrosis was classified into 0 to 4 stages. Hydroxyproline content was determined after liver tissues were hydrolyzed in HCl at 160 degree C for 2 hrs and then measured with spectrometry at 560 nm wavelength. mRNA levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were determined by semi-quantitive RT-PCR. Gelatinase activity of MMP-2 was examined by zymography using gelatin substrate.
In the model group the hepatic MMP-2 mRNA expression started to increase 10 days after DMN administration and remained at a much higher level than in the normal group throughout the study period, while TIMP-2 mRNA expression started to be lower than in the normal group 17 days after DMN administration and reached the lowest level on the 28th day. Then it rapidly rebounded and remained higher than that in the normal group from the 42nd day to the end of the study period. TIMP-2/MMP-2 began to be lower by several days than that of the normal group after DMN administration through the remaining study period. Zymography showed that the enzymatic activities of both latent MMP-2 and active MMP-2 were increased during the process of liver fibrosis.
In liver fibrosis, MMP-2 expression increases, while TIMP-2 expression relatively decreases. The enzymatic activities of MMP-2 increase as the liver fibrosis develops.
The case of a 15 year old girl with a rapidly progressing right sided hemiparesis is reported. The history and clinical manifestations were suggestive of either herpes simplex encephalitis or occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. At necropsy an occlusive thrombosis of the left middle cerebral artery due to a segmental necrotizing granulomatous panarteritis was found. The cause was obscure. A plausible incriminating factor was the contraceptive pill.
A 15 year old female began to suffer from a headache 12 hours prior to admission to a hospital in Broken Hill, N.S.W., Australia. Several hours after the onset of the headache, she had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Upon arrival at the hospital, she was lethargic, but did respond to commands. Her speech was slurred and the right side of her body was paralyzed. She had no fever and blood pressure was normal. Despite attempts to treat her with intravenous dexamethasone, she slipped into an unconscious state. A CT scan uncovered a left parietal hypodense lesion. Her pupils quickly dilated the next day. The right pupil did respond slightly to light, however. Physicians made a burr hole in the parietal area of her skull which exposed underlying necrotic tissue. After the operation, her brain stem failed to function. She died the following day, 3 days after the symptoms began. Other than a febrile convulsion at 10 months, she had been in good health. She had been taking a combined oral contraceptive (COC) made of 125mcg levonorgestrel and 50mcg ethinyl estradiol for 2 weeks. Pathologists found an area of necrosis in the left temporo-parietal region of the brain and an occlusive thrombosis near the left middle cerebral artery. Further, a pronounced segmental necrotizing vasculitis of the left middle cerebral and right posterior cerebral arteries existed. Based on other documented cases and this case, the physicians point to evidence that vessel size in vasculitis has an effect on the severity of the disease. Vasculitis in small vessels has a tendency to cause a gradual progression of the disease, while this disease in medium and large vessels may cause a rapid progression of the disease, as in this case. The researchers suspect that the COC may have precipitated the disease.
The present study was designed to evaluate the preventive role of rutin on lipids, lipoproteins, and ATPases in normal and isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Rutin (40 and 80 mg/kg) was orally administered to rats for a period of 42 days. After that period, isoproterenol (150 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously to male wistar rats at an interval of 24 h for 2 days. The weight of heart and the concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids were increased significantly (p < 0.05), and the concentration of phospholipids was decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the heart of ISO-treated rats. ISO-treated rats also showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) with a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level in serum. The activities of sodium potassium dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+)/K(+) ATPase) and magnesium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Mg(2+) ATPase) were decreased significantly (p < 0.05), and the activity of calcium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Ca(2+)ATPase) was increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the heart in ISO-treated rats. Pretreatment with rutin at doses of 40 or 80 mg/kg to ISO-treated rats showed a significant (p < 0.05) effect in all the parameters studied. Oral administration of rutin to normal rats did not show any significant effect. Thus, the results of our study show that pretreatment with rutin maintained the levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and ATPases in ISO-induced myocardial infarcted rats. The observed effects might be due to the antioxidant potential of rutin.
A considerable array of diseases are now recognized to be associated with misplacement of iron. Excessive deposits of the metal in sensitive tissue sites can result in formation of destructive hydroxyl radicals as well as in stimulation of growth of neoplastic and microbial cell invaders. To counteract potential iron damage, hosts employ the iron chelators, transferrin and lactoferrin. These proteins have been recently developed into pharmaceutical products. Additionally, a variety of low molecular mass iron chelators are being used/tested to treat whole body iron loading, and specific diseases for which the metal is a known or suspected risk factor.
Decabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-209) is widely used as brominated flame retardants (BFRs). In order to investigate its direct neurotoxic effects on mice and its self repair, mice were repeatedly exposured to BDE-209. Different concentrations of BDE-209 (0, 0.1, 40, 80 and 160mg/kgbw/d) were administered daily to CD-1 Swiss mice by gavage for 15, 30 and 60 days. Body and brain weights were recorded after the exposure. And the self repair was studied. Levels of acetylcholinesterase (TchE), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malonic dialdehyde (MDA) in brain were analyzed. Experimental results suggested that the nervous system was permanently damaged by BDE-209 through the cholinergic system enzyme.
Inhaled corticosteroids are commonly used in cystic fibrosis (CF), but there are few studies evaluating their safety in young children. We, therefore, prospectively administered beclomethasone diproprionate (BDP) to 12 clinically stable young children with CF to examine the safety of this therapy with respect to adrenal suppression and airway infection. To determine potential mechanisms of corticosteroid action in CF, we also examined airway markers of inflammation before and after inhaled steroid treatment. BDP 210 microg twice a day was given via spacer for 2 months. Twelve-hour serum and urine cortisols and response to low-dose synthetic ACTH cortisol stimulation were assessed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was examined pre- and posttreatment with BDP by quantitative bacteriology and indices of airway inflammation, including levels of total neutrophils, neutrophil elastase-alpha-1 antiprotease complexes (NEAP), CA 19-9 mucin-associated antigen, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and macrophage IL-8 mRNA. Following 2 months of treatment, serum and urine cortisol levels were unchanged. Response to low-dose ACTH cortisol stimulation was not significantly decreased at 30 min. Posttreatment BALF bacterial density was not statistically different from pretreatment; however, one patient who was initially culture negative became culture-positive with Hemophilus influenzae. BALF total neutrophil counts, corrected for epithelial lining fluid dilution, were decreased to approximately one third of pretreatment values (P = 0.03). NEAP and CA 19-9 mucin-associated antigen demonstrated similar decreases. BALF IL-8 levels and macrophage IL-8 mRNA levels were not statistically changed. These findings suggest that treatment with BDP 420 microg per day for 2 months in young children with CF does not affect urine and blood cortisol, causes no decrease in adrenal reserve, and does not result in a clinically significant increase in airway infection. In addition, the fall in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid inflammatory markers following BDP suggests possible modulation of neutrophil influx into the CF airway and provides justification for further studies of inhaled corticosteroids in CF.
Nefazodone is a new antidepressant exhibiting properties of selective serotonin reuptake inhibition and serotonin-2 receptor antagonism. There has been only one other published case of induction of mania in a patient treated with nefazodone. This report describes a second case of probable induction of mania with nefazodone therapy and briefly reviews clinical and theoretical considerations involved in this process.
Four cases of patients who described an unpleasant subjective experience of weakness and reduced muscle tone during treatment with clozapine are presented. An exacerbation of muscular dystrophy during clozapine treatment is also described. It is hypothesized that these adverse effects are related to the muscle relaxant properties of clozapine. The differential diagnosis of sedation, fatigue, asthenia, and reduced muscle tone is discussed.
Hypertension in pregnancy (HP), including preeclampsia, is known to be a multifactorial disease. Recently, a Glu298Asp variant of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (NOS3) was identified as being associated with coronary spasm and myocardial infarction, whereas it has been reported that endothelial nitric oxide synthase plays a role in HP. We therefore performed an association study of the Glu298Asp variant with HP among 152 HP patients and 335 normal pregnant control individuals, in the context of other risk factors before pregnancy. The frequency of the variant GA+AA NOS3 genotypes was significantly higher in the patients (0.23) than in the controls (0.12) (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that family history of hypertension, TT genotype of the angiotensinogen gene (AGT), GA+AA NOS3 genotype, and prepregnancy body mass index > or = 24 were independent potent risk factors, after adjustment for maternal age and parity. The odds ratios of the factors were 2.7, 2.3, 2.2, and 2.1, respectively. Our results suggested that the Asp298 of NOS3 is a potent, independent risk factor for HP.
To assess the benefit from adjuvant systemic tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer risk groups identified by the previously established prognostic 76-gene signature.
In 300 lymph node-negative (LNN), estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients (136 treated with adjuvant tamoxifen, 164 having received no systemic adjuvant therapy), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) as a function of the 76-gene signature was determined in a multicenter fashion.
In 136 tamoxifen-treated patients, the 76-gene signature identified a group of patients with a poor prognosis [hazard ratio (HR), 4.62; P = 0.0248]. These patients showed a 12.3% absolute benefit of tamoxifen in 10-year DMFS (HR, 0.52; P = 0.0318) compared with untreated high-risk patients. This represented a 71% increase in relative benefit compared with the 7.2% absolute benefit observed for all 300 patients without using the gene signature. In the low-risk group there was no significant 10-year DMFS benefit of tamoxifen.
The 76-gene signature defines high-risk patients who benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Although we did not study the value of chemotherapy in this study, low-risk patients identified by the 76-gene signature have a prognosis good enough that chemotherapy would be difficult to justify. The prognosis of these patients is sufficiently good, in fact, that a disease-free benefit for tamoxifen therapy is difficult to prove, though benefits in terms of loco-regional relapse and a reduction in risk for contralateral breast cancer might justify hormonal therapy in these patients.
When direct-current (DC) cardioversion is used, sinus rhythm can be restored, at least temporarily, in 80-90% of patients with atrial fibrillation. However, there is a small but significant group of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation in whom DC cardioversion has failed to restore sinus rhythm. The value of antiarrhythmic drug pretreatment before DC cardioversion is still controversial.
The aim of our study was to assess (1) the effectiveness of repeat DC cardioversion in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation after pretreatment with amiodarone, and (2) the efficacy of amiodarone in maintaining sinus rhythm after repeat cardioversion.
Forty-nine patients with chronic atrial fibrillation after ineffective DC cardioversion were included in the study. Repeat DC cardioversion was performed after loading with oral amiodarone, 10-15 mg/kg body weight/day for a period necessary to achieve the cumulative dose of over 6.0 g.
Spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm during amiodarone pretreatment was achieved in 9 of 49 patients (18%). Direct-current cardioversion was performed in 39 patients and sinus rhythm was achieved in 23 of these patients (59%). Mean heart rate decreased from 95 beats/min before to 68 beats/min after DC cardioversion (p < 0.001). Systolic blood pressure significantly (p < 0.05) decreased from 126 +/- 23 to 108 +/- 25 mmHg. Complications occurring in four patients just after electroconversion were well tolerated and of short duration. After 12 months, 52% of patients maintained sinus rhythm on low dose (200 mg/day) amiodarone therapy.
Pretreatment with amiodarone and repeat DC cardioversion allows for restoration of sinus rhythm in about 65% of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation after first ineffective DC cardioversion. Direct-current cardioversion can be performed safely with the use of standard precautions in patients who are receiving amiodarone. At 12 months' follow-up, more than 50% of patients maintain sinus rhythm on low-dose amiodarone after successful repeat cardioversion.
The cardiovascular beta-blocking effects of bornaprolol were studied in healthy male volunteers after four single oral doses. The inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia was monitored for 72 h in six subjects, and the inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia and rise of systolic blood pressure were monitored for 167 h in six other subjects. Plasma drug concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. Bornaprolol significantly reduced the resting heart rate, isoproterenol- and exercise-induced tachycardia, and effort hypertension. The peak effect was obtained within 1-2 h of drug administration and was correlated with dose. The effect on the isoproterenol test remained significant for 6 h after administration of 40 mg bornaprolol, and 72 h after 80, 120, and 240 mg. The effect of bornaprolol on the exercise test in comparison with placebo was significant during 23 h (120 and 240 mg) and 47 h (480 and 960 mg). A positive relationship was found for both tests between the maximum effect and the doses administered. A correlation was also found for each group of subjects between the time course of the plasma drug concentration and the effects of each bornaprolol dose on isoproterenol- and exercise-induced tachycardia. The beta-blocking effects in individual subjects, however, often continued long after the disappearance of detectable plasma drug concentrations.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective effect of the semisynthetic flavonoid 7-monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) on doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity in a phase II study in patients with metastatic cancer. Eight patients with metastatic cancer were treated with DOX preceded by a 10 min i.v. infusion of 1500 mg m(-2) monoHER. Five patients were examined by endomyocardial biopsy after reaching a cumulative dose of 300 mg m(-2). Histopathological changes in the cardiomyocytes (Billingham score) were compared with those described in literature for patients treated with DOX only. The mean biopsy score of the patients was higher (2.7) than the mean score (1.4) of historical data of patients who received similar cumulative doses of DOX. Although there is a considerable variability in few investigated patients, it was indicative that monoHER enhanced DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. However, the antitumour activity of DOX seemed better than expected: three of the four patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma had a partial remission and the fourth patient stable disease. It is likely that the relatively high dose of monoHER is responsible for the lack of cardioprotection and for the high response rate in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma possibly by depleting the glutathione defense system in both heart and tumour.
The possible adverse effects of chronic, high-dose fluconazole therapy are detailed from analysis of a multicenter, dose-escalating study of the therapy of invasive mycoses. Ninety-three adult patients were studied, 48 of these received > or = 6 months therapy and 20 received > or = 1 year. Fifty-eight patients received > or = 300 mg/day, and 7 received > or = 600 mg/day. One patient received 1,997 g over 86 months. Twenty-seven percent experienced possible symptomatic side effects, which resulted in 2 patients discontinuing therapy, and 42% had asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities, none of which were progressive. Headache, hair loss and anorexia were the most common symptoms experienced (each by 3% of patients), and eosinophilia and aspartate aminotransferase increases were the most common laboratory findings (12 and 10%, respectively). Fluconazole appears well tolerated and safe in these doses and durations.
Phenolic beta(2)-adrenoreceptor agonists salbutamol, fenoterol, and terbutaline relax smooth muscle cells that relieve acute airway bronchospasm associated with asthma. Why their use sometimes fails to relieve bronchospasm and why the drugs appear to be less effective in patients with severe asthma exacerbations remains unclear. We show that in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, both myeloperoxidase, secreted by activated neutrophils present in inflamed airways, and lactoperoxidase, which is naturally present in the respiratory system, catalyze oxidation of these beta(2)-agonists. Azide, cyanide, thiocyanate, ascorbate, glutathione, and methimazole inhibited this process, while methionine was without effect. Inhibition by ascorbate and glutathione was associated with their oxidation to corresponding radical species by the agonists' derived phenoxyl radicals. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), we detected free radical metabolites from beta(2)-agonists by spin trapping with 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP). Formation of these radicals was inhibited by pharmacologically relevant concentrations of methimazole and dapsone. In alkaline buffers, radicals from fenoterol and its structural analogue, metaproteronol, were detected by direct EPR. Analysis of these spectra suggests that oxidation of fenoterol and metaproterenol, but not terbutaline, causes their transformation through intramolecular cyclization by addition of their amino nitrogen to the aromatic ring. Together, these results indicate that phenolic beta(2)-agonists function as substrates for airway peroxidases and that the resulting products differ in their structural and functional properties from their parent compounds. They also suggest that these transformations can be modulated by pharmacological approaches using appropriate peroxidase inhibitors or alternative substrates. These processes may affect therapeutic efficacy and also play a role in adverse reactions of the beta(2)-agonists.
The efficacy and safety of 10 days' oral treatment with fleroxacin 400 mg once daily were compared with those of ofloxacin 400 mg twice daily in adults with skin and soft tissue infections. The most common diagnoses were skin abscess, cellulitis and wound infection. The most commonly-isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci. Overall bacteriological cure rates in patients with susceptible pathogens were 89% for 158 fleroxacin-treated patients and 97% for 157 ofloxacin-treated patients (treatment difference 8%; 95% confidence intervals 2-14%; p < 0.05). Clinical cure rates were 78% for fleroxacin and 83% for ofloxacin (treatment difference 5%; 95% confidence intervals-5-14%, not statistically significant). The overall safety profiles were similar and the most frequently reported events were insomnia, headache, dizziness, and digestive system disorders. More fleroxacin-treated patients experienced phototoxicity and treatment-limiting adverse events. In conclusion, compared to twice-daily ofloxacin, fleroxacin had similar clinical efficacy and the advantage of once-a-day dosing, but with slightly lower bacteriological cure rate and a higher rate of treatment-limiting adverse events.
A primary tubular sodium handling abnormality has been implicated in the edema formation of nephrotic syndrome. Dopamine synthesized by renal proximal tubules behaves as an endogenous natriuretic hormone by activating D(1)-like receptors as a paracrine/autocrine substance.
We examined the time courses of the urinary excretion of sodium, protein and dopamine in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-treated and control rats. The rats were sacrificed during greatest sodium retention (day 7) as well as during negative sodium balance (day 14) for the evaluation of renal aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) activity, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of renal dopamine. Also, the influence of volume expansion (VE) and the effects of the D(1)-like agonist fenoldopam (10 microg/kg bw/min) on natriuresis and on proximal tubular Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity were examined on day 7.
The daily urinary excretion of dopamine was decreased in PAN-treated rats, from day 5 and beyond. This was accompanied by a marked decrease in the renal AADC activity, on days 7 and 14. During VE, the fenoldopam-induced decrease in proximal tubular Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity was more pronounced in PAN-treated rats than in controls. However, the urinary sodium excretion during fenoldopam infusion was markedly increased in control rats but was not altered in PAN-treated animals.
PAN nephrosis is associated with a blunted renal dopaminergic system activity which may contribute to enhance the proximal tubular Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. However, the lack of renal dopamine appears not to be related with the overall renal sodium retention in a state of proteinuria.
A group of five cynomolgus monkeys was rendered parkinsonian by the toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and then treated daily with levodopa until all animals developed evident dyskinesia in the limbs after each dose. At this point, levodopa was replaced by selective D2 and D1 dopamine receptor agonists. All D2 agonists including quinpirole, (+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine, bromocriptine, terguride and (-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-n-propylpiperone reproduced the same dyskinesia, the intensity and duration of which was dose-dependent and paralleled the therapeutic effect. One D1 agonist, SFK-38393, was without effect (antiparkinsonian and dyskinetic) whereas another, CY-208243, induced antiparkinsonian at a low dose but also a dyskinetic effect at a higher dose. The effect of the selective agonists were antagonized completely by their corresponding antagonist but partially by the noncorresponding one. The effect of either D1 and D2 agonist was totally suppressed by the dopamine depleting agent alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, but the effect was restored by a small subthreshold dose of the other (complementary) agonist. Our results thus indicate that dyskinesia cannot be ascribed solely to the D2 or the D1 receptor and that some cooperation between the two receptors appears necessary for their manifestation.
We sought to examine the physical and mental health status and low birthweight and preterm birth among low-income pregnant women in substance abuse treatment.
A prospective correlational design was used with 84 pregnant women enrolled in a university-affiliated, comprehensive, hospital-based substance abuse treatment program. The majority of the sample reported heroin as their primary substance of abuse.
Approximately 39% of the infants were born preterm and 27.5% were low birthweight. Poorer perception of current health, cocaine as the primary substance of abuse, and number of prior substance abuse treatment admissions were independently associated with preterm birth. Being African American and a poorer perception of current health were independently associated with low birthweight.
Asking about perceptions of their current health is a useful addition to comprehensive assessment for pregnant women with substance abuse problems in any setting. Further knowledge of women's physical and mental health status will improve identification of those who are at even greater risk in a group at high risk overall.
Among 33 out-patients with endogenous depression, 16 were treated with bromocriptine (10-60 mg/day, mean 34) and 17 with imipramine (75-250 mg/day, mean 143). The total score on the Hamilton Rating Scale decreased during 6-week treatment from 19.9 to 7.8 in the bromocriptine group (P less than 0.001) and from 20.1 to 6.1 in the imipramine group (P less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups. The main side-effects were for bromocriptine: nausea, dizziness, and headache; for imipramine; dryness of mouth, dizziness, and sweating. This study suggests an antidepressant effect of bromocriptine although, due to the possibility of Type II error, it may not necessarily be equal to that of imipramine.
Infarct size (IS) reduction by ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has been assessed in the heart in which coronary stenosis (CS)-induced chronic ischemia was not present. The aim of this study is to assess whether and how IS reduction by IPC is modified in the heart in which CS has occurred, and how further therapeutics, if any, modify it.
We assessed the IS produced by a 30-minute acute coronary occlusion and a 24-hour reperfusion (COR) in rat hearts in which CS had developed for 1-12 weeks. Modifications of IS by IPC and the mitochondrial KATP channel (mitoKATP) opener and blocker, and the effects of daily beta-blocker treatment with carvedilol on them, were also assessed. Myocardial protein kinase C (PKC)-epsilon activities in the risk areas were measured by Western blotting.
One to 4 weeks after CS induction, myocardial PKC-epsilon was activated in the risk area of CS even without IPC, but such CS-induced PKC activation as well as that by IPC was attenuated 8-12 weeks after CS. The IS reductions by the mitoKATP opener as well as by IPC were attenuated 8-12 and 4-12 weeks after CS, respectively. Daily carvedilol treatment after inducing CS restored the malfunctioning PKC-mitoKATP signal cascade and the attenuated IPC and mitoKATP effect on IS.
CS activates the PKC-mitoKATP signal cascade, mimicking the IPC effect, whereas this cardioprotective effect is attenuated late after CS via their downregulation. Restoration of these changes may be a novel mechanism for cardioprotection by carvedilol in the CS-induced ischemic heart.
The safety and tolerability of lisinopril were assessed in 1,476 patients [1,165 hypertensives and 311 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF)] and 211 normal volunteers. The duration of lisinopril therapy ranged from 1 day to 16 months, with a mean duration of 105 days. In the hypertensive population, the most frequent clinical adverse experiences on lisinopril alone were headache, dizziness, cough, and diarrhea. Not all of these adverse experiences were thought to be drug related. Five percent of patients were discontinued because of adverse clinical experiences; cough and dizziness were the most common reasons for discontinuation. Two of 1,165 (0.17%) hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril died, compared to 0.41% of hypertensive patients on other therapies. Neither case was considered to be drug related. In patients with CHF, the most frequent clinical adverse experiences were dizziness, diarrhea, hypotension, fatigue, headache, and rash. Not all of these adverse experiences were thought to be drug related. The percent of CHF patients discontinuing because of an adverse clinical experience was 7.4%; the most frequent causes for discontinuation were hypotension, dizziness, or renal impairment. Twelve deaths occurred in 311 CHF patients treated with lisinopril (3.9%) compared to 4/104 (3.8%) of CHF patients treated with placebo and 2/65 (3.1%) treated with captopril. Hypotension, orthostatic effects, or dizziness following the initial lisinopril dose occurred infrequently in patients treated with lisinopril. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, including those treated previously or concomitantly with diuretic therapy, a first-dose hypotensive episode was reported in six of 955, or 0.6%. The incidence was higher (6.7%) in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
