The monoamine oxidase inhibitors are at present being used relatively infrequently in my opinion because of reports of severe and dangerous side effects such as toxic hepatocellular damage and hypertensive crises and also on account of several studies which have not given a very encouraging picture regarding the efficacy of this group of drugs. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that this group of antidepressant drugs is very useful when the proper indications for their employment are observed and are relatively safe provided that appropriate precautions such as the avoidance of cheese and other foods high in tyramine content are taken by the patients being treated with these compounds. The history, pharmacology, side effects, and indications for their use are reviewed, and it is indicated that the MAO inhibitors are the therapeutic agents of choice in atypical depressions associated with anxiety, phobic and hysterical symptoms, and depressive illnesses (including endogenous depressions) which have failed to respond satisfactorily to tricyclic antidepressants. It is then demonstrated both from a review of the literature relating to these drugs and also from my own clinical experience that these compounds are very effective when used in the treatment of the psychiatric conditions for which they are indicated and are also relatively safe when the appropriate precautions are conscienciously observed.
A 39-year-old Japanese woman had been receiving propylthiouracil for 5 years for hyperthyroidism when she developed myalgia, scleritis, proteinuria, fever, and inflammation of the nose. Examination of a renal biopsy specimen showed focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis. Indirect immunofluorescent staining showed a highly positive perinuclear pattern of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) in her serum. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of the ANCA showed positivity for anti-proteinase 3, anti-myeloperoxidase, anti-leukocyte elastase, and anti-lactoferrin, but anti-cathepsin G and anti-lysozyme were negative. Because ELISA showed the titer of anti-leukocyte elastase antibody to be markedly elevated, we challenged this data by performing dot blot analysis. The patient's serum reacted with the native form, but not with denatured leukocyte elastase. Propylthiouracil-induced vasculitis was suspected. Symptoms abated within 2 weeks and all values of ANCA were reduced after the drug was withdrawn. Vasculitis is a rare side-effect of propylthiouracil therapy. Recently it was reported in association with ANCA. We present the findings of this patient and compare them with those described in 19 published cases of propylthiouracil-induced vasculitis associated with ANCA.
A patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia developed hypokalemia during two separate courses of antibiotic therapy. In a review of 33 children from our institution with various malignant neoplasms, 24 of 48 antibiotic courses were associated with hypokalemia that could not be explained by gastrointestinal fluid losses. Carbenicillin disodium, gentamicin sulfate, and methicillin sodium or nafcillin sodium combination therapy was associated with hypokalemia in 23 of 35 courses in which serum electrolytes were monitored. No correlation between hypokalemia and the stage of the basic disease or the use of antineoplastic agents was found with this antibiotic combination. Our data and a review of the literature suggest that carbenicillin produces hypokalemia through an impermeant anion effect on the renal tubule. Children receiving carbenicillin should be monitored with frequent serum potassium determinations.
Six patients who took oral contraceptive agents for 5 to 18 years developed endometrial neoplasia. Endometrial adenocarcinoma occurred in 4 of these patients and severe adenomatous hyperplasia occured in 2. Five of the 6 patients took sequential agents; 1 patient used a combined agent. An additional patient who took Premarin and Provera sequentially developed adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Eighteen cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma and 7 cases of adenomatous hyperplasia in patients with long-term sequential oral contraceptive use have previously been reported by others. Progestogens may not be completely protective against the endometrial cancer-causing potential of the estrogens, especially in the sequential regimens.
Pulmonary hypertension is a severe and progressive disease, a key feature of which is pulmonary vascular remodeling. Several growth factors, including EGF, PDGF, and TGF-β1, are involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling during pulmonary hypertension. However, increased knowledge of the downstream signaling cascades is needed if effective clinical interventions are to be developed. In this context, calpain provides an interesting candidate therapeutic target, since it is activated by EGF and PDGF and has been reported to activate TGF-β1. Thus, in this study, we examined the role of calpain in pulmonary vascular remodeling in two rodent models of pulmonary hypertension. These data showed that attenuated calpain activity in calpain-knockout mice or rats treated with a calpain inhibitor resulted in prevention of increased right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, as well as collagen deposition and thickening of pulmonary arterioles in models of hypoxia- and monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, inhibition of calpain in vitro blocked intracellular activation of TGF-β1, which led to attenuated Smad2/3 phosphorylation and collagen synthesis. Finally, smooth muscle cells of pulmonary arterioles from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension showed higher levels of calpain activation and intracellular active TGF-β. Our data provide evidence that calpain mediates EGF- and PDGF-induced collagen synthesis and proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells via an intracrine TGF-β1 pathway in pulmonary hypertension.
Intestinal cancer is initiated by Wnt-pathway-activating mutations in genes such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). As in most cancers, the cell of origin has remained elusive. In a previously established Lgr5 (leucine-rich-repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5) knockin mouse model, a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase is expressed in long-lived intestinal stem cells. Here we show that deletion of Apc in these stem cells leads to their transformation within days. Transformed stem cells remain located at crypt bottoms, while fuelling a growing microadenoma. These microadenomas show unimpeded growth and develop into macroscopic adenomas within 3-5weeks. The distribution of Lgr5(+) cells within stem-cell-derived adenomas indicates that a stem cell/progenitor cell hierarchy is maintained in early neoplastic lesions. When Apc is deleted in short-lived transit-amplifying cells using a different cre mouse, the growth of the induced microadenomas rapidly stalls. Even after 30weeks, large adenomas are very rare in these mice. We conclude that stem-cell-specific loss of Apc results in progressively growing neoplasia.
Exposure to heavy metals may cause kidney damage. The population living near the Avonmouth zinc smelter has been exposed to cadmium and other heavy metals for many decades.
We aimed to assess Cd body burden and early signs of kidney damage in the Avonmouth population.
We used dispersion modeling to assess exposure to Cd. We analyzed urine samples from the local population (n = 180) for Cd (U-Cd) to assess dose (body burden) and for three biomarkers of early kidney damage [N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (U-NAG), retinol-binding protein, and alpha-1-microglobulin]. We collected information on occupation, intake of homegrown vegetables, smoking, and medical history by questionnaire.
Median U-Cd concentrations were 0.22 nmol/mmol creatinine (nonsmoking 0.18/smoking 0.40) and 0.34 nmol/mmol creatinine (nonsmoking 0.31/smoking 0.46) in non-occupationally exposed men and women, respectively. There was a significant dose-response relationship between U-Cd and the prevalence of early renal damage-defined as U-NAG > 0.22 IU/mmol-with odds ratios of 2.64 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.70-9.97] and 3.64 (95% CI, 0.98-13.5) for U-Cd levels of 0.3 to < 0.5 and levels >or= 0.5 nmol/mmol creatinine, respectively (p for trend = 0.045).
U-Cd concentrations were close to levels where kidney and bone effects have been found in other populations. The dose-response relationship between U-Cd levels and prevalence of U-NAG above the reference value support the need for measures to reduce environmental Cd exposure.
the multifunctional potential of neferine derived from the embryo of Nelumbo nucifera seeds for the age-related neurodegenerative disorders, in vivo anti-amnesic activities and in vitro cholinesterases (ChEs)- and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)-inhibitory activities, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities were investigated.
in vivo anti-amnesic activities were performed via the passive avoidance, Y-maze, and Morris water maze tasks in a scopolamine-induced amnesia model. The cell-free antioxidant capacities were evaluated by in vitro scavenging activities against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) radicals, and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), as well as inhibitory activities against nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anion (O(2)(-)), lipid peroxidation, and ONOO(-)-mediated tyrosine nitration. The intracellular antioxidant capacities were also determined via inhibitory activities of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO generation and NF-κB activation in RAW 264.7 cells.
neferine showed significant improvement in cognitive impairment in scopolamine-induced amnesia animal models and moderate inhibitory activities in ChEs and BACE1 assays. In addition, it exhibited notable scavenging activities against DPPH, ABTS, NO, and O(2)(-) radicals, as well as ONOO(-). Neferine also demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity against lipid peroxidation and protein nitration in cell-free antioxidant assays and moderate inhibitory activity of NO generation with exceptional suppression of NF-κB activation in cell-based assays.
the results demonstrate that the anti-amnesic effect of neferine may be mediated via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities, as well as inhibition of ChEs and BACE1.
Cadmium exposure has been associated with increased all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality. However, studies investigating this association have included participants with considerably higher levels of cadmium than those found in the general population.
We aimed to evaluate the association of creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium levels with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the U.S. general population.
We analyzed the relationship between cadmium measured in 13,958 adults who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1988-1994 and were followed through 31 December 2000, and all-cause, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease mortality.
The geometric mean levels of urinary cadmium per gram of urinary creatinine in study participants were 0.28 and 0.40 microg/g for men and women, respectively (p < 0.001). After multivariable adjustment, including smoking, a major source of cadmium exposure in nonoccupationally exposed populations, the hazard ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] for all-cause, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease mortality associated with a 2-fold higher creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium were, respectively, 1.28 (95% CI, 1.15-1.43), 1.55 (95% CI, 1.21-1.98), 1.21 (95% CI, 1.07-1.36), and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.11-1.66) for men and 1.06 (95% CI, 0.96-1.16), 1.07 (95% CI, 0.85-1.35), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.84-1.04), and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.89) for women.
Environmental cadmium exposure was associated with an increased risk of all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality among men, but not among women. Additional efforts are warranted to fully explain gender differences on the impact of environmental cadmium exposure.
To evaluate the ocular safety of short-term use of vigabatrin to treat cocaine and/or methamphetamine addiction.
Individuals who were actively using cocaine and/or methamphetamine were eligible for enrollment. Enrolled subjects were scheduled for comprehensive eye examinations at the beginning and end of the study. Visual field testing was performed at baseline and 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 1 month or more after discontinuing vigabatrin. Twenty-eight subjects received at least 1 dose of vigabatrin; however, only 20 subjects continued beyond the initial escalating vigabatrin dose phase to the treatment phase. Of these 20 subjects, 18 completed the study with full follow-up. Visual fields were evaluated subjectively by 2 glaucoma specialists and analyzed objectively for group and individual changes in quadrant mean sensitivity. The objective analysis was also repeated for superior field quadrants after excluding the uppermost peripheral points to minimize the eyelid effect. The main outcome measures were change of visual field, visual acuity, and ocular adverse effects.
Vigabatrin seemed to help treat cocaine and/or methamphetamine addiction. Of 18 subjects, 16 had negative test results for cocaine and methamphetamine use during the last 6 weeks of the trial. No ocular adverse events were detected. The subjective evaluation did not reveal visual field constriction in any of the 18 evaluable participants. Objective group and individual analyses for quadrant mean sensitivity did not show any change from baseline in any quadrant. No changes in visual acuity were noted.
In this short-term pilot study, vigabatrin seemed to help treat cocaine and/or methamphetamine abuse. There was no evidence of ocular or visual field adverse effects.
Two patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for disseminated adenocarcinoma of the colon developed cerebellar dysfunction typical of 5-FU neurotoxicity. The neurotoxicity was associated with oculomotor disturbances expressed primarily as weakness of convergence and divergence. Detailed postmortem examination of one patient revealed no anatomical abnormalities of the central nervous system. The ocular motor disturbances are probably an expression of regional 5-FU neurotoxicity primarily affecting the brain stem.
Exposure to methamphetamine (METH) and phencyclidine (PCP) during early development is thought to produce later behavioral deficits. We postulated that exposure to METH and PCP during later development would produce similar behavioral deficits, particularly learning deficits in adulthood. Wistar rats were treated with METH (9 mg/kg), PCP (9 mg/kg), or saline during later development, postnatal days (PD) 50-51, and subsequent behavioral changes were examined including: locomotor activity during the acute drug state (PD 50-51) and the post-drug phase (PD 50-80); social interaction on PD 54-80; and spatial discrimination and reversal in adulthood (after PD 90). METH and PCP differentially affected locomotion during the acute state, but not during the post-drug phase. METH decreased social interaction throughout tests two weeks after drug treatment, whereas PCP decreased social interaction only during the first 8 min of tests. Neither METH nor PCP impaired initial acquisition of spatial discrimination. However, reversal was significantly impaired by PCP, whereas METH produced a mild deficit, compared to controls. Our data provide evidence that exposure to PCP and METH during later development lead to enduring cognitive deficits in adulthood. Selective impairment of reversal may reflect neurological damage in the prefrontal cortex due to early exposure to drugs.
We previously cloned human G protein gamma 7 (GNG7) and demonstrated that it was downregulated in gastrointestinal cancer. The significance of GNG7 expression in oesophageal cancer is unknown. TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR was performed to determine the clinical significance of GNG7 expression in 55 cases of oesophageal cancer. Furthermore, GNG7-transfected oesophageal cancer cells were analysed in laboratory studies at genomic and epigenetic levels. Twenty-seven patients with low GNG7 expression showed significantly poorer survival than did 28 patients with high expression (P<0.05). Tumours with low GNG7 expression invaded deeper than those with high GNG7 expression (P<0.05), both in vivo and in vitro. Eight tumours retained GNG7 expression, and they did not show either promoter hypermethylation or loss of heterozygosity (LOH). In 38 tumours with GNG7 suppression, 22 (57%) showed either LOH or promoter hypermethylation. In addition, GNG7 expression was significantly associated with the presence of miR328 in oesophageal cancer cell lines, which suggests that this microRNA might be a regulator of GNG7 expression. GNG7 suppression represents a new prognostic indicator in cases of oesophageal cancer. GNG7 might be suppressed by LOH and promoter hypermethylation or by microRNA.
Community-acquired, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are on the rise among patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. A new, serious community-acquired MRSA manifestation, postpartum iliopsoas pyomyositis is described.
A 24-year-old Hispanic female presented with back pain 9 days after a normal vaginal delivery. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive ill-defined edema of the left iliopsoas. Blood cultures yielded community-acquired MRSA. The patient received intravenous vancomycin for 6 days, followed by intravenous, then oral, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She was discharged on day 8 and made a full recovery.
Iliopsoas pyomyositis is a new manifestation of community-acquired MRSA in the obstetric population that may masquerade as benign musculoskeletal back pain. Obstetricians must be alert to the range of presentations of this emerging pathogen.
To investigate the efficacy of mirtazapine in treating akathisia caused by risperidone and olanzapine, as well as its use in alleviating comorbid depressive disorder.
Five patients with diagnoses varying from schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and bipolar disorder developed akathisia while on treatment with olanzapine and risperidone. The likelihood that risperidone and olanzapine had induced akathisia in all patients was rated probable according to the Naranjo probability scale. Four of these patients were also found to be depressed. The akathisia was successfully treated with mirtazapine, and 3 of the 4 depressed patients improved with mirtazapine treatment. Use of mirtazapine did not result in any adverse effect.
Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of central alpha(2) auto- and hetero-adrenergic receptors, as well as an antagonist of 5-HT(2A/2C), 5-HT(3), and histaminergic H(1) postsynaptic receptors. The efficacy of mirtazapine in treatment of akathisia may result from its antagonist property at the H(1) receptors and its dopaminergic activity in frontal cortex. The use of mirtazapine offers advantages over other anti-akathisia drugs in its better adverse effect profile, as well as its ability to treat coexisting depression.
Mirtazapine is efficacious in treating atypical antipsychotic-induced akathisia. It may be a good option, particularly in patients with coexisting depression.
The acute coronary hemodynamic and metabolic effects of intravenous dipyridamole were studied in 13 patients. Total left ventricular (LV), anterior (supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery) and inferior (supplied by circumflex and right coronary arteries) regional flows and metabolic responses were assessed from the coronary sinus and great cardiac vein. Perfusion to LV regions was classified as potentially "normal" or "abnormal," based on coronary angiographic findings. Before dipyridamole, coronary flow, LV oxygen delivery and lactate extraction in both the normal and abnormal regions were similar. Within 1 minute after injection of 20 mg of dipyridamole by i.v. bolus, total coronary flow increased 51% (p less than 0.05). Fifteen minutes after injection the flow increase persisted. Flow decreased to approximately control level by 20 minutes. The major component of this increased total coronary flow resulted from increased flow in normal regions (75% at 1 minute, p less than 0.05). Mean regional LV oxygen delivery and lactate extraction were not changed significantly in either normal or abnormal regions. However, lactate production occurred more often after dipyridamole in abnormal regions. These results suggest that during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, regional coronary flow and metabolic responses depend upon the status of the arteries supplying the LV region. Regional differences in flow and metabolism occur independent of major changes in heart rate and aortic and LV pressures.
To examine the in vitro and in vivo attributes of aspartame and to determine its efficacy for treating sickle cell anemia.
Aspartame (l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester) binds with 2 human Bence Jones proteins. The proteins (Mcg and Sea) showed phenylalanine penetrating into hydrophobic binding sites. This aspartame property suggested a potential to interfere with sickle hemoglobin fibril formation.
For the in vitro studies, blood from 20 subjects monitored for sickle cell anemia was collected in heparinized tubes. Specimens were divided in thirds and aspartame was added to 2 tubes to yield a 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL concentration. Sickled cells that were present after a drop from each aliquot was added to a fresh 2% metabisulfite solution were counted 3 times. For the in vivo studies, 23 subjects from the Sickle Cell Clinic (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Okla) consented to participate in a randomized single-dose administration of 1.5, 3.0, or 6 mg/kg aspartame. Heparinized blood was obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, and 1440 minutes after aspartame administration. Specimens were counted in a blinded manner by means of the technique used for the in vitro method, but a photomicrograph of 1 field from each triplicate count was made. The pictures were marked and were computer counted.
For the in vitro studies, sickled cells decreased from 28% to < 14% when 1 mg/mL aspartame was added and decreased further with 2 mg/mL. For the in vivo studies, a decreased number of sickled cells in homozygous blood (HbSS) were observed after oral administration of aspartame. Sickling was inhibited by 6 mg/kg aspartame for at least 6 hours in 15 subjects with HbSS anemia.
Further evaluations of the efficacy of aspartame for sickle crisis and crisis prevention appears to be warranted.
Environmental compounds including fungicides, plastics, pesticides, dioxin and hydrocarbons can promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult-onset disease in future generation progeny following ancestral exposure during the critical period of fetal gonadal sex determination. This study examined the actions of the pesticide methoxychlor to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult-onset disease and associated differential DNA methylation regions (i.e. epimutations) in sperm. Gestating F0 generation female rats were transiently exposed to methoxychlor during fetal gonadal development (gestation days 8 to 14) and then adult-onset disease was evaluated in adult F1 and F3 (great-grand offspring) generation progeny for control (vehicle exposed) and methoxychlor lineage offspring. There were increases in the incidence of kidney disease, ovary disease, and obesity in the methoxychlor lineage animals. In females and males the incidence of disease increased in both the F1 and the F3 generations and the incidence of multiple disease increased in the F3 generation. There was increased disease incidence in F4 generation reverse outcross (female) offspring indicating disease transmission was primarily transmitted through the female germline. Analysis of the F3 generation sperm epigenome of the methoxychlor lineage males identified differentially DNA methylated regions (DMR) termed epimutations in a genome-wide gene promoters analysis. These epimutations were found to be methoxychlor exposure specific in comparison with other exposure specific sperm epimutation signatures. Observations indicate that the pesticide methoxychlor has the potential to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the sperm epimutations appear to provide exposure specific epigenetic biomarkers for transgenerational disease and ancestral environmental exposures.
Paranoia in methamphetamine (MA) users is not well characterized or understood. To investigate this phenomenon, we created the Methamphetamine Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), and tested its reliability and validity in assessing MA-induced paranoia. We administered the MEQ to 274 MA-dependent subjects. Of the total subjects, 45% (123) first experienced paranoia with MA use; 55% did not. Obtaining or using a weapon while paranoid was common (37% and 11% of subjects with MA-induced paranoia, respectively). Test-retest and inter-rater reliability for MA-induced paranoia showed substantial agreement (kappa = .77, p < .05 and kappa = .80, p < .05, respectively). First episodes of paranoia occurred more often with intravenous use of MA, and subsequent episodes at higher doses. There was modest correlation between paranoia on the MEQ and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) paranoid ideation scale (rho = .27, p < .05). As expected, there was a poor correlation between paranoia on the MEQ and the BSI depression scale (rho = .14, p = .07). The MEQ provides useful information on drug use variables that contribute to paranoia commonly associated with MA use. (Am J Addict 2010;00:1-14).
We report the findings from the first large, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of psychotic and behavioral symptoms in institutionalized elderly patients with dementia.
625 patients (67.8% women; mean age = 82.7 years) with DSM-IV diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (73%), vascular dementia (15%), or mixed dementia (12%) and significant psychotic and behavioral symptoms were included. Each patient was randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/day, 1 mg/day, or 2 mg/day of risperidone for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease rating scale (BEHAVE-AD).
The study was completed by 70% of the patients. Baseline Functional Assessment Staging scores were 6 or 7 in more than 95% of the patients, indicating severe dementia. At endpoint, significantly greater reductions in BEHAVE-AD total scores and psychosis and aggressiveness subscale scores were seen in patients receiving 1 and 2 mg/day of risperidone than in placebo patients (p = .005 and p < .001, respectively). At week 12, 0.5 mg/day of risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing BEHAVE-AD aggression scores (p = .02). More adverse events were reported by patients receiving 2 mg/day of risperidone than 1 mg/day. The most common dose-related adverse events were extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, and mild peripheral edema. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms in patients receiving 1 mg/day of risperidone was not significantly greater than in placebo patients.
Risperidone significantly improved symptoms of psychosis and aggressive behavior in patients with severe dementia. Results show that 1 mg/day of risperidone is an appropriate dose for most elderly patients with dementia.
Visual hallucinations may be caused by organic cerebral lesions and by drugs including indomethacin. We report here a case of indomethacin-induced visual hallucinations in which a clear description of the phenomenology shows how a complex hallucinatory experience may arise from the relatively non-specific effects of cerebral irritation.
Three consecutive cases of post-partum psychosis, admitted to a specialist unit, developed severe postural hypotension during treatment with standard doses of antipsychotic drugs. Post-partum patients may be particularly vulnerable to this side-effect, and the possible role of alpha-adrenoceptors in mediating this increased susceptibility to hypotension is discussed. It is suggested that antipsychotic drugs with relatively selective dopamine-blocking activity may be specifically indicated in the treatment of post-partum psychosis.
