Heart failure is thought to be more common and of greater severity in African-Americans (AAs). Potential mechanisms remain uncertain. The importance of micronutrient deficiencies in the pathophysiologic expression of congestive heart failure (CHF) in AAs remains to be explored, including hypovitaminosis D, which can promote secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), together with hypozincemia and hyposelenemia, the 2 most crucial trace minerals integral to diverse biologic functions. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), Zn, and Se were monitored in 30 AAs hospitalized during June through December 2005, with decompensated failure and reduced ejection fraction (EF) (<35%) of predominantly nonischemic origin treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), furosemide, and spironolactone. Based on their symptomatic status before hospitalization, 15 patients were stratified as having protracted (>or=4 weeks) CHF, whereas 15 patients had short-term (1-2 weeks) CHF. These hospitalized patients were compared with 10 AA outpatients with stable, similarly treated compensated failure and comparable EF, and 9 AA normal volunteers without cardiovascular disease. Serum PTH was elevated in all patients with protracted CHF and in 60% of patients with short-term CHF, but not in compensated patients or normal volunteers. However, serum 25(OH)D was reduced in all patients with >or=4 weeks and 80% with either 1-2 weeks CHF or compensated failure compared with volunteers. Serum Zn was below normal in 11 of 15 patients with protracted CHF, in 8 of 15 patients with shorter duration CHF, and in 5 of 10 patients with compensated failure. Serum Se was reduced in all patients with >or=4 weeks, 60% with short-term CHF, and 90% of compensated patients. Concomitant to hypovitaminosis D, hypozincemia, and hyposelenemia, SHPT is a covariant of CHF in housebound AAs.
There have been several recent publications reporting vasospastic complications under heparin-dihydroergotamine prophylaxis. We report on 2 patients without significant coronary artery stenosis who died of acute myocardial infarction. Both patients had been operated on for a lumbar disc protrusion and were treated with 2500 IU heparin + 0.5 mg dihydroergotamine s.c. twice daily. The possibility of coronary arterial spasm as the cause of the myocardial infarctions is discussed. Publications reporting cases with myocardial infarctions, presumably caused by coronary arterial spasm, and other vasospastic complications under ergotamine therapy are briefly reviewed.
The conflicting results reported by genetic studies with the variants of the genes coding for the dopaminergic system in cocaine addicts could be partially explained by the difficulties to constitute homogenous sample of patients. Childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and/or impulsivity are frequently associated with cocaine addiction and could participate in the heterogeneity of the samples in cocaine addicts. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that cocaine addiction would be associated with the variants of the genes coding for the dopamine system in an homogenized sample of cocaine addicts, especially in individuals with childhood ADHD comorbidity, or with a high impulsivity score. The potential association of the variants TaqI A of the DRD2, BalI of the DRD3, exon III repeat of the DRD4, and 3' UTR VNTR of the DAT was examined in African-Caribbean males, smoked-cocaine dependents. All the subjects were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview of Genetic Studies, the Barratt's impulsivity scale, and the Wender Utah rating scale for childhood ADHD. A positive association was found with the DRD2 and DRD4 polymorphisms in the subgroups of patients with childhood ADHD, or with a high impulsivity score, which represented, respectively, 53.3 and 73.0% of the patients. Conversely, no positive association was found for any of the polymorphisms studied when the group of patients was examined as a whole. Therefore, our results suggest that the clinical dimensions of childhood ADHD and of impulsivity could be taken into account to homogenize the samples of patients in cocaine association studies.
Paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis involves two factors, direct injury by oxygen free radicals and indirect injury by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been shown to act as a mediator of pulmonary fibrosis, and its formation increases during oxidative stress. We investigated whether green tea extract (GTE), which has antioxidant properties, inhibits paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis and whether ET-1 is involved in this process. Paraquat (0.3 mg/kg) was instilled into the right lungs of rats, following which the rats were either not further treated (Group P, n = 7), or they were administered 1% GTE mixed with feed (Group PG; n = 7) or the ET(A) receptor antagonist ZD2574 (10 mg/kg through gavage; Group PZ; n = 7) for two weeks. As control, we used rats instilled with saline (Group N; n = 6). Two weeks after paraquat instillation, we assayed the degree of pulmonary fibrosis by light microscopic morphometry and hydroxyproline content; lipid peroxidation as a marker of oxidative stresses by measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA); ET-1 by immunohistochemistry; and prepro-ET-1 mRNA expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Compared with Group N, significant pulmonary fibrosis was observed in Group P, accompanied by increases in MDA, ET-1, and prepro-ET-1 mRNA expression. Compared with Group P, Group PG showed significant decreases in pulmonary fibrosis, along with decreases in MDA, ET-1, and prepro-ET-1 mRNA expression. We also observed significant decreases in pulmonary fibrosis in Group PZ compared with Group P. These findings suggest that GTE inhibits paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis by suppression of oxidative stress and ET-1 expression.
Tumor hypoxia and anemia have been linked to poor overall survival and local control in carcinomas of both the uterine cervix and the head and neck for patients undergoing radiotherapy. Little is known about the effect of these factors on the outcome of NSCLC patients with locally advanced disease undergoing chemoradiation therapy.
To examine the impact of anemia in stage III NSCLC patients undergoing combined modality therapy, we reviewed our database from three sequential trials of concurrent weekly paclitaxel +/- carboplatin and radiation therapy. 115 pts from 17 institutions were enrolled from 4/94 to 5/97. In this series, hemoglobin values were collected before treatment and weekly during radiotherapy. We correlated baseline Hb and Hb changes during chemoradiation treatment with overall survival.
Although pretreatment anemia was common (30% Hb = 110-130 g/l, 16% Hb <110 g/l), log-rank analyses of presenting Hb, average Hb and minimum Hb during treatment were not statistically significantly predictive of survival. However in a Cox model, declining hemoglobin during chemoradiation had a statistically significant impact on survival.
These analyses reveal that a decline in hemoglobin during chemoradiation for stage III NSCLC has a statistically significant correlation with overall survival. Strategies maximizing hemoglobin during combined modality therapy need further exploration in well-planned randomized trials.
Fenretinide [N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide or 4-HPR] is a synthetic retinoid analogue with antitumor and chemopreventive activities. N-(4-Methoxyphenyl)retinamide (4-MPR) is the most abundant metabolite of 4-HPR detected in human serum following 4-HPR therapy. We have shown in in vitro studies that 4-HPR and 4-MPR can act independent of the classic nuclear retinoid receptor pathway and that 4-HPR, but not 4-MPR, can also activate nuclear retinoid receptors. In this study, we have compared the chemopreventive effects of topically applied 4-HPR and 4-MPR with the primary biologically active retinoid, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in vivo in the mouse skin two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model. All three retinoids suppressed tumor formation but the effect of 4-HPR and 4-MPR, and not of ATRA, was sustained after their discontinuation. The tumor-suppressive effects of 4-HPR and 4-MPR were quantitatively and qualitatively similar, suggesting that the two may be acting through the same retinoid receptor-independent mechanism(s). We further explored this effect in vitro by analyzing primary cultures of mouse keratinocytes treated with the same retinoids. All three could induce apoptosis with a 48-hour treatment and only ATRA and 4-HPR induced an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This finding is consistent with our previous results showing that the effects of phenylretinamides on the cell cycle are retinoid receptor dependent whereas apoptosis induction is not. A microarray-based comparison of gene expression profiles for mouse skin treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) alone and TPA + 4-HPR or TPA + 4-MPR reveals a high degree of coincidence between the genes regulated by the two phenylretinamides. We propose that 4-HPR may exert therapeutic and chemopreventive effects by acting primarily through a retinoid receptor-independent mechanism(s) and that 4-MPR may contribute to the therapeutic effect of 4-HPR by acting through the same retinoid receptor-independent mechanism(s).
Sequential computed tomographic (CT) studies of 11 patients (aged five months to seven years) with intractable epilepsy treated with synthetic ACTH-Z showed brain shrinkage in all cases. Brain shrinkage started to appear on daily ACTH injections for seven days, reached the maximum within four weeks of administration (14 injections every day and then 7 injections every other day), and almost returned to the original status in seven out of nine cases which were followed up for one to three months after the therapy. The subjects aged less than two years showed more remarkable brain shrinkage than did those aged more than five years. Furthermore, two other cases were complicated by subdural effusion after ACTH therapy. It is the authors' assumption that both of these phenomena are caused by the high concentration of corticosteroid through a change of the water and electrolyte contents in the brain.
There is evidence suggesting that the respiratory response to sedation is different in patients with sleep apnoea, which is common in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). This study examined the respiratory response of sedation with propofol and alfentanil, whose pharmacokinetics are not affected by the renal function, in CRF patients.
Chronic renal failure patients who underwent arteriovenous-fistular surgery (CRF group) and patients who underwent chemoport insertion (control group) were enrolled in this study. Sedation was induced by infusing propofol 1.5 micro/ml and alfentanil 0.2 micro/kg/min continuously in both groups. In the desaturation study, the respiratory rate and peripheral oxygen saturation in room air were checked. In the apnoea-hypopnoea study, the patient's sedation (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation) score, apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) was recorded using a portable ventilation effort recorder (microMesam) while applying 5 l/min of oxygen through a facial mask.
The desaturation event was more common (21.5/h vs. 2/h, p = 0.001) in the CRF patients. Apnoea and hypopnoea (AHI: 13.0 vs. 1.6, p = 0.012, per cent of patients with an AHI > 5: 53.3% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.014) occurred more frequently in the CRF patients but the sedation score was not different.
Chronic renal failure patients have a higher risk of developing apnoea and hypopnoea during sedation, which highlights the need for careful monitoring and management in these patients.
Implication of pharmacogenetic variations and efavirenz pharmacokinetics in concomitant efavirenz based antiviral therapy and anti-tubercular drug induced liver injury (DILI) has not been yet studied. We performed a prospective case-control association study to identify the incidence, pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic and biochemical predictors for anti-tubercular and antiretroviral drugs induced liver injury (DILI) in HIV and tuberculosis (TB) co-infected patients.
Newly diagnosed treatment naïve TB-HIV co-infected patients (n = 353) were enrolled to receive efavirenz based ART and rifampicin based anti-TB therapy, and assessed clinically and biochemically for DILI up to 56 weeks. Quantification of plasma efavirenz and 8-hydroxyefaviernz levels and genotyping for NAT2, CYP2B6, CYP3A5, ABCB1, UGT2B7 and SLCO1B1 genes were done. The incidence of DILI and identification of predictors was evaluated using survival analysis and the Cox Proportional Hazards Model. The incidence of DILI was 30.0%, or 14.5 per 1000 person-week, and that of severe was 18.4%, or 7.49 per 1000 person-week. A statistically significant association of DILI with being of the female sex (p = 0.001), higher plasma efavirenz level (p = 0.009), efavirenz/8-hydroxyefavirenz ratio (p = 0.036), baseline AST (p = 0.022), ALT (p = 0.014), lower hemoglobin (p = 0.008), and serum albumin (p = 0.007), NAT2 slow-acetylator genotype (p = 0.039) and ABCB1 3435TT genotype (p = 0.001).
We report high incidence of anti-tubercular and antiretroviral DILI in Ethiopian patients. Between patient variability in systemic efavirenz exposure and pharmacogenetic variations in NAT2, CYP2B6 and ABCB1 genes determines susceptibility to DILI in TB-HIV co-infected patients. Close monitoring of plasma efavirenz level and liver enzymes during early therapy and/or genotyping practice in HIV clinics is recommended for early identification of patients at risk of DILI.
Moricizine is a Class I antiarrhythmic drug currently approved for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The drug has received significant attention because of its role in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial. Previous data suggested that the agent has a relatively low proarrhythmic potential. This may lead clinicians to use the drug empirically for less significant ventricular arrhythmias. We report a case of life-threatening late proarrhythmia caused by moricizine and comment on our experience with this agent. We feel that this drug has significant proarrhythmic potential and should not be used empirically to treat ventricular ectopy especially in patients with underlying structural heart disease.
This study investigated the ability of amitraz, a formamidine insecticide, to induce cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases and to disrupt estrogenic activity in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and immature female rats. In MCF-7 cells, treatment with 10 microM amitraz for 24 h increased 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity in cell homogenate. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 1 and 10 microM amitraz for 3 h replaced previously bound [(3)H]17beta-estradiol (E(2)) from estrogen receptors. Treatment with 0.1 and 1 microM amitraz for 2 days inhibited [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA of MCF-7 cells while the inhibition was blocked in cells co-treated with 1 nM E(2) and amitraz. In immature female rats, treatment with 50 mg/kg amitraz intraperitoneally for 3 days increased cytochrome P450 content, 7-ethoxyresorufin, methoxyresorufin and pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylases, and benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activities in liver microsomes. The results of immunoblot analysis revealed that amitraz induced liver microsomal CYP1A1/2, 2B1/2B2, and 3A proteins. Treatment with 10 and 25 mg/kg amitraz for 3 days dose-dependently decreased uterine weight and peroxidase activity in immature female rats while the decreases were blocked in rats co-treated with 10 microg/kg E(2) and 10 or 25 mg/kg amitraz. These in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that amitraz induces multiple forms of P450 and exerts weak antiestrogenic activity.
A double-blind eight-week study was carried out to compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone in relation to haloperidol. Sixty-two inpatients suffering from acute schizophrenic or schizoaffective psychoses diagnosed according to ICD-9 were treated with risperidone 2-20 mg daily or haloperidol 2-20 mg daily. The mean total BPRS scores were reduced from 45.5 to 32.4 in the risperidone group and from 43.1 to 28.5 in haloperidol group. There were no significant differences between the two treated groups with regard to the total BPRS score and the percentage of remissions achieved. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups in any of the factors or items except guilt feeling (p < 0.02), anxiety (p < 0.005), and factor I--anxiety/depression--(p < 0.02) in favour of haloperidol. Risperidone had the benefit of a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side-effects.
A case is presented of a 29-year old woman who developed sudden onset of abdominal pain, vomiting, near syncope, abdominal tenderness, profound hypotension, and a late menstrual period. The patient was in good health and her only medication was zomepirac for musculoskeletal discomfort. An exploratory mini-laparotomy was performed for the suspicion of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, but no evidence of hemoperitoneum or of ectopic pregnancy was found. A subsequent pregnancy test was negative, and the episode was attributed to a zomepirac reaction. A review of zomepirac and zomepirac reactions is included.
The electrophysiological effects of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent penbutolol (4 mg i.v.) were studied in 15 patients by means of intracardiac recording using the extra-stimulus technique and rapid atrial pacing. The following effects were observed. (1) Significant prolongation of the sinus cycle length (16%). (2) Significant prolongation of the AV-nodal conduction time during sinus rhythm (12%). (3) Significant prolongation of the AV-nodal conduction time with increasing atrial pacing rate (16--29%). At 150/min, 4 of 7 patients with intact AV-conduction under baseline conditions developed second degree AV-block 15 to 30 min after penbutolol administration. (4) Significant prolongation of the effective refractory period of the AV-node (19%). Penbutolol had no effect on the intraventricular conduction, on intraatrial conduction or on the corrected sinus node recovery time.
Methylmercury (MeHg) is a known neurotoxin, yet the mechanism for low dose chronic toxicity is still not clear. While N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) were found to be induced after exposure to MeHg in a mink model, its role on neurotoxicity is not known. The aims of this study were to investigate the expression and the functional roles of NMDARs on the induction of cell death in the human SH-SY 5Y neuroblastoma cell line after exposure to MeHg. NMDARs were measured using a radiolabeled phencyclidine receptor ligand [(3)H] (MK801) and cell death was quantified using fluorogenic substrates specific for caspase-3 (DEVD-AFC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. We found a significant increase in NMDARs followed by increased caspase-3 activity after 4 h of exposure to MeHg (0.25-1 microM). Necrotic cell death was found after 4 and 24 h of exposure to MeHg (0.25-5 microM). The NMDAR antagonists dizocilpine ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-iminemaleate [(+)-MK801]) and Memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane) (10 microM) completely attenuated MeHg-mediated cell death by blocking NMDARs, thus demonstrating the importance of NMDARs in mercury neurotoxicity. Intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (1 microM) partially attenuated the neurotoxicity effect of 1 microM MeHg. These results suggest that MeHg toxicity can be mediated through the binding and increase of NMDARs.
Steroid creams applied topically to the skin are routinely used in the treatment of many dermatoses. Their use on the face in severe atopic eczema is relatively common. We report a series of three patients who whilst using topical facial steroids developed advanced glaucoma. A further two cases of ocular hypertension secondary to topical facial steroids are also described. This is the first series of cases to be reported demonstrating the potentially blinding complications of topical facial steroids. Recommendations are made with regard to screening such patients for glaucoma.
Microinjections of carbachol (carbamylcholine chloride) into the amygdaloid complex of rats produced behavioral and electrophysiological seizures which subsided within 24 hours. A persisting functional change caused a deficit in avoidance learning 1 to 3 weeks after the seizure. A cholinergic system is implicated by the fact that cholinergic blockade (scopolamine) of the amygdala during training reversed the effects of the seizures induced by carbachol.
Methotrexate is known to synergize with cytarabine [1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C)] in a schedule-dependent manner. The purpose of this article is to compare and contrast the activity of pralatrexate (10-propargyl-10-deazaminopterin)/gemcitabine to the standard combination of methotrexate/ara-C and to determine if schedule dependency of this combination is important in lymphoma.
Cytotoxicity assays using the standard trypan blue exclusion assay were used to explore the in vitro activity of pralatrexate and gemcitabine against a panel of lymphoma cell lines. Both severe combined imunodeficient beige and irradiated nonobese diabetic/severe combined imunodeficient mouse xenograft models were used to compare and contrast the in vivo activity of these combinations as a function of schedule. In addition, apoptosis assays were conducted.
Compared with methotrexate-containing combinations, pralatrexate plus gemcitabine combinations displayed improved therapeutic activity with some schedule dependency. The combination of pralatrexate and gemcitabine was superior to any methotrexate and ara-C combination in inducing apoptosis and in activating caspase-3. In vivo, the best therapeutic effects were obtained with the sequence of pralatrexate --> gemcitabine. Complete remissions were only appreciated in animals receiving pralatrexate followed by gemcitabine.
These data show that the combination of pralatrexate followed by gemcitabine was superior to methotrexate/ara-C in vitro and in vivo, and was far more potent in inducing apoptosis in a large B-cell lymphoma. These data provide strong rationale for further study of this combination in lymphomas where methotrexate and ara-C are used.
Ticlopidine is a powerful antiplatelet activator that inhibits adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. Its most common side-effects are skin rashes, diarrhea and neutropenia. Aplastic anemia is rare. This paper reports a patient with severe aplastic anemia that developed after the use of ticlopidine. The 85-year-old woman developed fever, chills and chest pain 5 weeks after starting ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily. Severe aplastic anemia was proved by blood examination, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. In spite of the recovery of absolute neutrophil count to more than 1,000/mm3, 16 days after ticlopidine was stopped and administration of strong antibiotics, the patient died from candidal sepsis.
The safety and efficacy of ondansetron were evaluated in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Five hundred patients who experienced nausea or vomiting in the Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit within the first 2 h of recovery were randomized to receive either 1, 4, or 8 mg of ondansetron, or placebo. All patients had undergone ambulatory surgery with general endotracheal anaesthesia. Episodes of emesis, nausea scores, adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory values were assessed before and during the 24 h after study drug administration. Patients were evaluated for the first 2 h in the Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit then followed up for the next 22 h. Complete response was defined as no emetic episodes, no nausea or no rescue anti-emetic medication. For the 0-24 h study period, complete response occurred in only 15% of the placebo group compared to 41%, 47%, and 47% in the 1, 4, and 8 mg ondansetron groups, respectively. Mean nausea scores (scale of 0-10) during the initial observation period (0-2 h) were significantly lower for all doses of ondansetron [2.2 (1 mg), 1.7 (4 mg), and 2.1 (8 mg)] compared to placebo (3.0). The optimal dose of ondansetron for the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting was found to be 4 mg. All doses of ondansetron were well tolerated. No clinically significant increases in laboratory parameters or alterations in haemodynamic stability occurred in the ondansetron groups compared to placebo.
Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (NAB-paclitaxel) is an albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel that has demonstrated improved efficacy compared with paclitaxel in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. We undertook this trial to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and single-agent activity of NAB-paclitaxel administered on a weekly basis to patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
This was an open-label, single-arm, phase I/II study. Patients were treated with NAB-paclitaxel intravenously during 30 minutes without corticosteroid or antihistamine premedications on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Radiologic tumor assessment was performed every 8 weeks.
Dose levels of 100 and 125 mg/m(2) were tolerated without dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). At 150 mg/m(2) the MTD was exceeded; two of three patients experienced a DLT (grade 3 sensory neuropathy and febrile neutropenia). The 125 mg/m(2) dose level was expanded and determined to be the MTD. A total of 40 patients were treated at 125 mg/m(2). The objective response rate was 30% (12 of 40 patients; 95% CI, 16% to 44%), median time to progression was 5 months (95% CI, 3 to 8 months), and median overall survival was 11 months (95% CI, 7 months to not reached). The 1-year survival was 41%.
NAB-paclitaxel 125 mg/m(2) administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle was well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging single-agent activity. No corticosteroid premedication was administered and no hypersensitivity reactions were seen. Additional studies of single-agent NAB-paclitaxel as well as platinum-based combinations are warranted.
Central sensitization, caused either by tissue inflammation or peripheral nerve injury, plays an important role in persistent pain. An animal model of capsaicin-induced pain has well-defined peripheral and central sensitization components, thus is useful for studying the analgesic effect on two separate components. The focus of this study is to examine the analgesic effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia, which represents central sensitization. Capsaicin (0.1%, 20 microl) was injected into the plantar side of the left hind paw, and foot withdrawal thresholds in response to von Frey stimuli (mechanical sensitivity) were determined for both primary and secondary hyperalgesia in rats. EA (2 Hz, 3 mA) was applied to various pairs of acupoints, GB30-GB34, BL40-BL60, GV2-GV6, LI3-LI6 and SI3-TE8, for 30 min under isoflurane anesthesia and then the effect of EA on mechanical sensitivity of paw was determined. EA applied to the ipsilateral SI3-TE8, but to none of the other acupoints, significantly reduced capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia but not primary hyperalgesia. EA analgesic effect was inhibited by a systemic non-specific opioid receptor (OR) antagonist or an intrathecal mu- or delta-OR antagonist. EA analgesic effect was not affected by an intrathecal kappa-OR antagonist or systemic adrenergic receptor antagonist. This study demonstrates that EA produces a stimulation point-specific analgesic effect on capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia (central sensitization), mediated by activating endogenous spinal mu- and delta-opioid receptors.
The use of neuromuscular blocking agents, particularly pancuronium, in patients receiving mechanical ventilation has been reported to cause prolonged paralysis and atrophy. We describe two mechanically ventilated patients with asthma who developed prolonged muscular weakness and atrophy after receiving the shorter-acting agent vecuronium. These cases illustrate the potential of any neuromuscular blocking agent to cause these complications, especially in patients who are immobile, have decreased renal or liver function, or receive concomitant myotoxic agents.
-LE300, a benz[d]indolo[2,3-g]azecine with nanomolar affinities to the hD(1) receptor family, has been further pharmacologically characterized and its modelled structure was compared to its X-ray structure in order to explain NMR data, that was not in accordance to the X-ray structure. Moderate affinity at the hD(3) receptor was determined, nanomolar affinities were found at the 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors, micromolar affinity at the 5-HT(1A) receptor using binding assays. Functional studies indicate moderate antagonist activity at the 5-HT(2A) site. No activity was found at dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. These results suggested the use of LE300 for cocaine addiction treatment. High activities were found using in vivo testing: LE300 suppressed spontaneous locomotor activity with an ID(50) of 1.24 mg/kg and attenuated locomotor activity induced by 20 mg/kg cocaine with an AD(50) of 1.50 mg/kg. It failed to substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects produced by cocaine.
Different weekly doses (400 to 3,000 micrograms) of the new, long-acting dopamine agonist Cabergoline (Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) were given to 11 hyperprolactinemic women with pituitary tumor. Pituitary computerized tomography (CT) scans were performed before the start of treatment and after 3 (n = 5), 6 (n = 3), and 9 (n = 3) months of Cabergoline administration. Plasma prolactin (PRL) was determined in blood samples collected before and at weekly intervals during Cabergoline administration. Cabergoline induced marked inhibition of PRL secretion in conjunction with a CT demonstration of reduction in the pituitary tumor size in all patients. The potent, long-lasting PRL inhibitory effect of Cabergoline and the absence of side effects typical of dopaminergic compounds suggest that the use of this drug is advantageous over others in the medical treatment of hyperprolactinemia.
