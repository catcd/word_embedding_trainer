Copper is known as Gunma Kaalan in Siddha literature, which means that the drug is effective for healing ulcers. The herbomineral drug "Thamira parpam" is prepared by calcining the purified copper foils with rock salt, lime juice, bracteated birth wort juice, and Alangium root decoction according to Siddha medicine. Our study investigated the possible role of Thamira parpam (TP) in the management of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers. Cysteamine (400 mg kg(-1)â€‰body weight(-1), two doses at 4 h interval) orally given to rats resulted in high ulcer index, increased TBARS with concomitant depletion of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and inflammatory markers cathepsin D, and myeloperoxidase (p < 0.01). Herbomineral drug TP (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg, p.o.) challenged with cysteamine attenuated the elevation of TBARS and imbalance of antioxidants. In the increases in liver inflammatory markers, tissue histopathology changes were not severe in TP treatment. Positive control omeprazole (25 mg/kg, body weight, orally) showed considerable protection against anomaly in biochemical parameters and tissue histology. Hence, our results indicate that the attenuation of oxidative stress by the herbomineral drug in experimentally induced damage to liver and duodenum of rats could be mediated by free radical quenching property.
Twelve patients were treated with op'DDD over a 9-year period. All presented with mild neurological symptoms, and half of them had major complications. There was no relation between the occurrence of these symptoms and the dose or duration of op'DDD therapy. The mechanisms of this neurological toxicity, both central and peripheral, are not well known, but they appear to be similar to those of certain op'DDD-related chemicals used in industry.
Oral contraceptive (OC) use is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Previous data reported higher thrombotic risk in women using third-generation combined OC than in those using second generation OC. The difference could be explained by differential effects of progestagens on plasma sensitivity to activated protein C (APC). The main purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess the influence of a progestagen-only OC (chlormadinone acetate) as well as the effect of several combined OC with different progestagen components on APC resistance. The effect of APC on endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) was investigated in the plasma of healthy women using either combined OC (n=82) or progestagen-only OC (n=28), and in non-users (n=64). Carriers of factor V Leiden were excluded. Compared with non-users, there was no significant change in APC resistance in women using progestagen-only OC. Women who used combined OC were less sensitive to APC than non-users (P < 0.001) and the difference was significantly more pronounced in women using third-generation OC (n=41) than in those who used second-generation OC containing levonorgestrel (n=22) (P < 0.05). Compared with OC containing levonorgestrel, use of norethisterone-containing OC (n = 9) was associated with an increased resistance to APC (P < 0.05). Women who used cyproterone-containing OC (n = 10) were less sensitive to APC than those using third-generation OC (P < 0.05) or second-generation OC containing levonorgestrel (P < 0.05). Protein S, factor II and FVIII levels explained in part the OC-related changes in APC sensitivity variations. ETP-based APC resistance may contribute to explain why different brands of OC can be associated with different levels of thrombogenicity.
Amrinone is a positive inotropic agent which has been widely used for treatment of left heart failure. As this drug has a relaxing effect on smooth muscle cells, we considered that hemodynamics and ventilatory mechanics could be simultaneously improved in patients with right heart failure caused by obstructive lung disease. Swan-Ganz catheters were used in 11 patients. Following injection of 1.5 mg/kg Amrinone, cardiac output increased from 6.1 to 6.9 l/min (p less than 0.05). Stroke volume showed only a slight increase; pulmonary vascular resistance was reduced from 407 to 308 dynes . s . cm-5 (p less than 0.01). Body plethysmographic examination revealed a decrease of specific airway resistance from 33 to 24 cm H2O . s (p less than 0.01).
In patients with right heart failure due to obstructive lung disease Amrinone application can result in an improvement in both hemodynamics and ventilatory mechanics.
Norepinephrine is implicated in cocaine's behavioral effects. In this study, we tested the effect of prazosin, an alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, on cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.
Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously under a fixed-ratio 3 schedule of reinforcement. After behavior was established, cocaine was replaced with saline and behavior extinguished. The ability of cocaine (0, 5-20 mg/kg) alone or combined with prazosin (.3 mg/kg) to reinstate lever press responding was tested. The effects of prazosin on lever press responding for food was examined in another set of rats.
Cocaine induced a dose-dependent reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior that was significantly attenuated by prazosin. This dose of prazosin did not alter lever press response rates for food.
The attenuation in drug-induced reinstatement is likely not due to prazosin-induced suppression of activity. These results suggest alpha1-adrenergic mechanisms contribute to reinstatement in rats and perhaps, to relapse in addicts.
Proteoglycan synthesis is dependent on N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) produced by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway or obtained exogenously. Although used therapeutically to relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis, the actions of glucosamine and its analogs on cartilage are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects on chondrocytes of N-acylated-glucosamine analogs bearing alkyl chains of different lengths. Chondrocytes isolated from neonatal rat femoral condyles were cultured in the presence of glucosamine analogs. GlcNAc, N-proprionyl glucosamine (GlcNPro), or N-butyryl glucosamine (GlcNBu) did not alter cell number, lactate dehydrogenase release, or metabolic acid production, consistent with lack of cytotoxicity. Treatment of chondrocyte cultures with GlcNBu for 6 days significantly increased levels of type II collagen and aggrecan mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis. In contrast, GlcNAc and GlcNPro had no significant effect. A significant increase in type II collagen mRNA was induced by GlcNBu within 3 days. GlcNBu did not alter stability of type II collagen mRNA, suggesting it acts on gene transcription. We have previously shown that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) decreases levels of type II collagen mRNA. However, chondrocytes pretreated with GlcNBu maintained type II collagen mRNA at control levels in the presence of TNFalpha. These results establish that the N-butyrylated analog of glucosamine but not GlcNAc promotes matrix gene expression by chondrocytes. Thus, GlcNBu has the potential for use as a chondro-protective agent in osteoarthritis.
We studied the role of theophylline on outcome of status epilepticus (SE) in children. During a two-year-period, 16 of 114 episodes of SE occurred in children receiving theophylline. At the onset of SE, theophylline blood levels were elevated in 8 episodes, and were therapeutic or subtherapeutic in 8 episodes. In the 8 episodes of SE with elevated theophylline levels, one child died and three suffered permanent new neurologic deficits. In the 8 episodes of SE with normal or low theophylline levels, only one child had a transient deficit. The occurrence of death or disability in 4 of 8 episodes of SE with elevated theophylline was considerably higher than the 23% incidence of death or persistent CNS deficit in the overall series of 114 episodes of SE. We conclude that theophylline, at toxic levels, is a significant factor in increased morbidity. We suspect that the hypoxia from the respiratory disorder for which theophylline was used, and the reduced cerebral blood flow known to occur with theophylline led to a failure to compensate for the increased cerebral metabolic rate of SE, thus increasing the risk of a poor outcome.
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-21 and MMP-26 (matrilysin-2) are two recently cloned epithelial metalloproteases. Here we examined their expression in various benign skin disorders, in which macrophages and fibroblasts have been implicated as well as in cultures of these cells. Expression of MMP-21 was detected by immunohistochemistry in a subset of macrophages of granulomatous skin lesions and in fibroblasts in dermatofibromas. MMP-21 mRNA was found in THP-1, U937, HEL 299 and Hs68 cells. Furthermore, MMP-21 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in cultures of the same cell lines. In culture MMP-21 was upregulated by phorbol myristate acetate in THP-1 cells and by retinoic acid (RA) in U937 cells, and downregulated by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in HEL 299 as assessed by Taqman quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression of MMP-26 was detected by immunohistochemistry in granulomatous skin diseases and actinic elastosis. MMP-26 at both mRNA and protein levels was only found in HEL 299 cells. In culture it was downregulated by TGF-beta1, RA and IL-1beta as assessed by Taqman quantitative PCR. Our results suggest these two novel MMPs are not only associated with cancer but may be important in connective tissue remodelling and pathobiology of various benign skin disorders.
Long-term exposure to benzene can potentially result in severe haematotoxicities, including pancytopaenia, aplastic anaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, which are often accompanied by life-threatening symptoms and high mortality. Previous studies demonstrate that benzene-induced haematotoxicities are immune-mediated and that cyclosporin A is a prominent treatment in acquired aplastic anaemia. This study aims to evaluate the potential role of cyclosporin A immunosuppressive therapy for severe benzene-induced haematotoxicity. Between January 2002 and December 2008, 41 patients with severe benzene-induced haematopoietic disorders from five hospitals were enrolled in the study, 22 patients received cyclosporin A, supportive treatments and/or oral testosterone undecanoate, 19 patients were treated with supportive treatments and/or oral testosterone undecanoate as the control group, and a 6-month follow-up was conducted. The results showed that in the cyclosporin A group, 19 of 22 patients (86.36%) had responded to the treatments completely or partially with increased platelets, white blood cells and hemoglobulin counts by the fourth week (P=0.005), the sixth week (P=0.001) and the third month post-treatment (P=0.034), respectively. However, in the control group treated by supportive methods, only 5 of 19 patients (26.32%) responded to the treatments partially (P<0.001). Cyclosporin A in conjunction with supportive treatments may be an effective treatment modality for patients with severe benzene-induced haematopoietic disorders, which in turn implies that these haematotoxicities are immune-mediated.
In 5 patients, 3 women aged 30, 32 and 41 years and 2 men aged 36 and 56 years, serious side effects developed after starting aripiprazole, a new antipsychotic drug. 2 patients had not been treated with antipsychotic drugs before, while in 3 there was a switch in antipsychotic treatment. The side effects consisted primarily oftroubling feelings ofagitation, akathisia, insomnia and dysphoria. 3 of the patients made a suicide attempt and 2 developed suicidal thoughts. The patients had not previously attempted suicide and the suicidal thoughts disappeared after discontinuation ofaripiprazole. Suicidal tendencies have not been reported before as a side effect ofaripiprazole.
Hepatic allografts from donors positive for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) frequently transmit hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection to recipients. Therefore, most transplantation centers will not use these organs for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Although it is expensive and not always efficacious, hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) has been used routinely for indefinite periods to prevent HBV infection in liver allograft recipients. We assessed the effectiveness of long-term use of a nucleoside analog, lamivudine, in preventing HBV transmission by anti-HBc-positive allografts.
Retrospective study.
A tertiary care center.
Twelve patients received hepatic allografts from anti-HBc-positive donors at Loyola University Medical Center, Chicago, between February 23, 1998, and March 13, 2001.
All patients received 10 000 U/d of intravenous HBIG for 7 days. In addition, they received 300 mg/d of lamivudine in divided doses. Their liver biopsy specimens were tested for HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). Serum samples from the donor and recipient were tested for HBcAb, HBV DNA, and hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb).
The incidence of HBV infection in recipients who received HBcAb-positive donor livers and lamivudine prophylaxis.
All recipients were anti-HBc negative before OLT. Five of the recipients had HBsAb titers greater than 150 U at the time of OLT. Three of the donor livers were HBV DNA positive and 2 were hepatitis B core antigen positive at the time of OLT. Donor serum was HBcAb positive in all 12 donors. None of the recipients have become infected with HBV with a follow-up of 2 to 38 months.
Perioperative use of HBIG combined with long-term use of lamivudine can prevent HBV infection in recipients who receive hepatic allografts from HBcAb-positive donors.
Four groups of DSM III bipolar patients, whose plasma lithium levels were maintained at 0.30-0.45 (group A), 0.46-0.60 (group B), 0.61-0.75 (group C), and 0.76-0.90 (group D) mEq/l respectively, were followed-up for two years. The mean number of affective episodes and the mean total morbidity during the lithium treatment period were significantly decreased in all groups except group A when compared with the pre-lithium period. Moreover, in group A, the mean total scores on CPRS depressive and manic items during the interepisodic periods were significantly higher than in each of the other groups. As a result of the low scores of patients in group A and the high scores of patients in group D on the side effect checklist, the frequency and intensity of side effects differed significantly among the four groups. These data suggest that, in the prophylactic treatment of bipolar patients, plasma lithium levels should, as a rule, be adjusted to the range 0.46-0.75 mEq/l.
1. This case report of a Chinese male schizophrenic patient describes new side effects that have not been documented previously for patients treated with clozapine. At certain doses of clozapine, the patient showed direct adverse reactions, which include a combination of hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia, and periodic paralysis. 2. In a four-year study of this patient who had no previous episodes of diabetes in his or his family history, the authors found that these symptoms disappeared upon withdrawal of clozapine and relapsed with re-treatment of the drug. This study indicates that hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia, and periodic paralysis may need to be monitored on patients treated with clozapine.
The possibility of detecting segment-specific injury of the proximal tubule by means of urinary enzymes was investigated in rats. Urinary glutamine synthetase, an enzyme exclusively localized in the S3 segment, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, prevalently a S1-S2, but S3 enzyme also, were determined after single treatment with 100 mg/kg body wt. of hexachloro-1:3-butadiene (HCBD; i.p.), toxic for the S3 segment, or 25 mg/kg body wt. of potassium dichromate (s.c.), toxic for the S1-S2 segments. Excretion of total urinary proteins was also measured. In addition, a dose-response relationship was determined between three doses (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body wt.) of HCBD and glutamine synthetase activity in urine. Glutamine synthetase activity, measured according to a new assay for urine based on modification of methods developed for organs, increased in the urine only when the S3 segment of the proximal tubule was damaged, as demonstrated by histological findings of the kidneys. HCBD caused early excretion of the enzyme related to the necrosis of the S3 segment, whereas potassium dichromate caused a slight increase only when the resulting lesion to this segment (vacuolization) began to develop. On the contrary, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity showed the peak of excretion 24 and 34 h after treatment with HCBD or potassium dichromate, respectively, according to the histological findings of necrosis of the S3 segment (the former) and vacuolization of the S1-S2 segments (the latter). Excretion of total urinary proteins reached the peak 24 h (HCBD) and 48 h (potassium dichromate) after treatment. HCBD at 200 mg/kg body wt, caused a peak of glutamine synthetase activity in urine 10 h after injection, whereas the peak caused by doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg body wt. occurred 24 h following treatment. The peak of enzyme activity in urine significantly increased with the dose. The results suggest that the measurement of urinary activity of S3 segment-specific enzyme as glutamine synthetase allows us to detect early S3 segment-specific injury of the proximal tubule. In addition, the method for urinary enzyme activity appears sensitive, simple and fast.
Increased sympathetic nervous system activity and vasopressin release has been demonstrated in established DOCA-salt hypertension in the rat. To determine the importance of these mechanisms in centrally-mediated pressor responses in this model of hypertension, both awake rats and rats anaesthetised with urethane were given intracerebroventricular injections of carbachol. The systolic blood pressure after implanting a silicon rubber mould containing DOCA, and with subsequent substitution of 1% saline in tap water, increased from 112 +/- 3 mmHg to a stable 188 +/- 7 mmHg by the end of 4 weeks, measured using a tail-cuff method. The blood pressure consistently became elevated when carbachol was injected into the cerebral ventricles of awake rats. Of the three groups of normotensive rats (NTR), sham-operated rats (SHAM) and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats (DOCA), the magnitude of the pressor phase was largest in the DOCA rats. The heart rate in all three groups of rats decreased similarly. When the rats were later anaesthetised with urethane to allow recording of abdominal sympathetic nerve activity, the carbachol injections caused biphasic blood pressure responses and sympathetic nerve discharge consisting of initial vasodepression and sympathetic nerve inhibition of short duration. This was followed by a sustained pressor phase accompanied by a corresponding increase in sympathetic nerve activity. The magnitude of the pressor response was again larger in the DOCA than in the SHAM rats. Spinal section abolished the initial depressor phase but did not much affect the sustained pressor phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Compared with low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, carbon-ion radiation has been proved to induce high frequency of more complex DNA damages, including DNA double strands (DSBs) and non-DSB clustered DNA lesions. Chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin has been reported to elicit additional H2AX phosphorylation in polyploidy. Here, we investigated whether mitotic DNA damage induced by high-LET carbon-ion radiation could play the same role. We demonstrate that impairment of post-mitotic G1 and S arrest and abrogation of post-mitotic G2-M checkpoint failed to prevent mis-replication of damaged DNA and mis-separation of chromosomes. Meanwhile, mitotic slippage only nocodazole-related, cytokinesis failure and cell fusion collectively contributed to the formation of binucleated cells. Chk1 and Cdh1 activation was inhibited when polyploidy emerged in force, both of which are critical components for mitotic exit and cytokinesis. Carbon-ion radiation irrelevant of nocodazole incurred additional DNA breaks in polyploidy, manifesting as structural and numerical karyotype changes. The proliferation of cells given pre-synchronization and radiation was completely inhibited and cells were intensely apoptotic. Since increased chromosomal damage resulted in extensive H2AX phosphorylation during polyploidy, we propose that the additional Î³-H2AX during polyploidy incurred by carbon-ion radiation provides a final opportunity for these dangerous and chromosomally unstable cells to be eliminated.
Concerns over neurotoxicity have impeded the development of sustained release formulations providing prolonged duration local anesthesia (PDLA) from a single injection, for which there is an urgent clinical need. Here, we have used toxicogenomics to investigate whether nerve injury occurred during week-long continuous sciatic nerve blockade by microspheres containing bupivacaine, tetrodotoxin, and dexamethasone (TBD). Animals treated with amitriptyline solution (our positive control for local anesthetic-associated nerve injury) developed irreversible nerve blockade, had severely abnormal nerve histology, and the expression of hundreds of genes was altered in the dorsal root ganglia at 4 and 7 days after injection. In marked contrast, TBD-treated nerves reverted to normal function, were normal histologically and there were changes in the expression of a small number of genes. Toxicogenomic studies have great potential in delineating patterns of gene expression associated with specific patterns of tissue injury (e.g. amitriptyline neurotoxicity), and in identifying related changes in gene expression upon exposure to a drug, biomaterial, or drug delivery system.
Convulsions from abrupt clonazepam withdrawal in patients with a seizure history or concurrent neuroleptic use have been described in the literature. This is a report of a patient without these precipitating factors developing seizure despite "gradual" reduction of clonazepam by .5 mg every 4 days. The possibility of clonazepam withdrawal seizures should be kept in mind even in patients not considered at risk for developing seizures. Clonazepam cessation should be more gradual, even slower than .5 mg every 4 days.
To evaluate the relationship between common genetic variation in genes involved in the biosynthesis and signaling of estrogen and progesterone and endometriosis risk.
Genetic polymorphism analysis.
Population-based case-control study conducted in Group Health Cooperative enrollees in western Washington.
Women with newly diagnosed, surgically confirmed endometriosis between 1996 and 2001 (n = 256) and age- and reference year-matched female control subjects without a history of endometriosis (n = 567).
None.
We evaluated the relationship between common genetic variation and endometriosis risk, using gene-based tests and single-variant analysis of genetic polymorphisms in ESR1, ESR2, PGR, CYP17A1, CYP19A1, HSD17B1, HSD17B2, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, COMT, and GSTM1.
The most consistent gene-based association with endometriosis risk was for CYP19A1. We did not find evidence for consistent significant associations between previously reported candidate SNPs in sex hormone-related genes and endometriosis risk.
In summary, we report increased endometriosis risk with CYP19A1 gene-based tests; replication of the association between endometriosis and this gene or gene region is necessary in a larger study population.
The focus was on haloperidol (central dopamine antagonist)-stomach lesion, a longly described suitable counterpart of dopamine blocker cysteamine-duodenal lesion. In this, the contribution of blockade of central/peripheral dopamine receptors and prostaglandins synthesis, along with influence of antiulcer agents was evaluated in mice. Male NMRI Hannnover mice were sacrificed 24 h after haloperidol (25 mg/kg b.w. i.p., given alone or with saline (haloperidol+saline) (i) or in combination (ii,iii)). Supporting central dopamine predominance for haloperidol stomach lesion induction, co-administration of peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist domperidone (5 mg/kg i.p.) (haloperidol+ domperidone) (ii), or prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg s.c.) (haloperidol+ indomethacin) (iii) did not aggravate this lesion. (i) In haloperidol+saline challenged mice the lesions were inhibited by co-administration (/kg i.p.) of a gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, GlyGluProProProGlyLysProAlaAspAspAlaGlyLeuVal, M.W. 1419 (10 microg, 10 ng, 10 pg, but not 1 pg, 100 fg, 10 fg), bromocriptine (10 mg), omeprazole (10 mg, 100 mg, but not 1 mg). Atropine (10, 100, 200 mg), pirenzepine (10, 100, 200 mg), misoprostol (10, 100, 200 microg), pantoprazole (1, 10, 100 mg), lansoprazole (0.1, 1, 10 mg), cimetidine (10, 100, 200 mg) and ranitidine (10, 100, 200 mg) were not effective. (ii) Dopamine peripheral blockade influence: in haloperidol+domperidone mice, previously effective bromocriptine, pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (10 microg) or omeprazole (10 mg) did not attenuate stomach lesions. (iii) Prostaglandins synthesis blockade effect: in haloperidol+indomethacin mice, previously effective agents, bromocriptine or omeprazole were not active, while BPC 157 effect was only lessened.
Twenty-nine patients with mild to severe essential hypertension were treated with titrated doses of xipamide, before or after treatment with 50 and , if necessary, 100 mg hydrochlorothiazide in a 13- to 25-week open crossover study. Based on supine diastolic pressure readings taken at weekly intervals, xipamide controlled hypertension in all subjects: 17 achieved control with a daily dose of 5 mg; seven, with 10 mg; and five, with 20 mg. In contrast, eight of the 29 patients could not be controlled with 100 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide. The only significant biochemical change observed was an increase in serum uric acid in 12 patients after hydrochlorothiazide but in only six patients after xipamide. Natriuresis was comparable after both drugs; 5 and 10 mg xipamide were as effective as 50 and 100 mg hydrochlorothiazide. The only side effect noted, cramping due to hypokalemia, occurred during treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, but not xipamide, and was reversed by potassium supplements.
Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that is characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain and sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. In this pilot clinical trial, we tested the effectiveness of low-dose naltrexone in treating the symptoms of fibromyalgia.
Participants completed a single-blind, crossover trial with the following time line: baseline (2 weeks), placebo (2 weeks), drug (8 weeks), and washout (2 weeks).
Ten women meeting criteria for fibromyalgia and not taking an opioid medication.
Naltrexone, in addition to antagonizing opioid receptors on neurons, also inhibits microglia activity in the central nervous system. At low doses (4.5 mg), naltrexone may inhibit the activity of microglia and reverse central and peripheral inflammation.
Participants completed reports of symptom severity everyday, using a handheld computer. In addition, participants visited the lab every 2 weeks for tests of mechanical, heat, and cold pain sensitivity.
Low-dose naltrexone reduced fibromyalgia symptoms in the entire cohort, with a greater than 30% reduction of symptoms over placebo. In addition, laboratory visits showed that mechanical and heat pain thresholds were improved by the drug. Side effects (including insomnia and vivid dreams) were rare, and described as minor and transient. Baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted over 80% of the variance in drug response. Individuals with higher sedimentation rates (indicating general inflammatory processes) had the greatest reduction of symptoms in response to low-dose naltrexone.
We conclude that low-dose naltrexone may be an effective, highly tolerable, and inexpensive treatment for fibromyalgia.
Neurological complications of both fluorouracil (5-FU) and its oral prodrug, capecitabine, have been described in the literature. This study reported the case of a 70-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoid of the rectum who developed hyperammonemic encephalopathy, following infusional 5-FU therapy, manifesting itself as intractable nausea, vomiting, confusion and disorientation. Interestingly, when the patient was rechallenged with the fluoropyrimidine analog, capecitabine, neither hyperammonemia nor symptom recurrence was observed. 5-FU is an integral component of effective anti-neoplastic treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, but is often discontinued when neurotoxicity develops. This case highlighted the use of capecitabine as an alternative for patients who have demonstrated evidence of 5-FU-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Re-challenging the patient with capecitabine, at a low daily dose intensity, accounted for the overall tolerability of the treatment, as demonstrated by normal ammonia levels and the lack of neurological symptoms.
This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM-5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM-5887 on low-grade cardiotoxicity pre-induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs. In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg). The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing. Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM-5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations. To examine a possibly deteriorating cardiotoxic effect of SM-5887, low-grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg). Nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. The low-grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment. On the contrary, the SM-5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy. In conclusion, SM-5887 does not have any potential of chronic cardiotoxicity and deteriorating effect on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in dogs.
Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is a common complication of lung and certain other cancers. The hypercalcemia results from the actions of tumor factors on bone and kidney. We report here the isolation of full-length complementary DNA clones of a putative hypercalcemia factor, and the expression from the cloned DNA of the active protein in mammalian cells. The clones encode a prepro peptide of 36 amino acids and a mature protein of 141 amino acids that has significant homology with parathyroid hormone in the amino-terminal region. This previously unrecognized hormone may be important in normal as well as abnormal calcium metabolism.
Menadione is a commonly used compound that causes oxidative stress. We investigated the influence of lipid peroxidation on the apoptotic response of mouse myogenic C2C12 cells following menadione-induced oxidative stress. The presence of hypodiploid cells and phosphatidylserine translocation were assayed to detect apoptotic cells. Menadione at 10-40 micro M induced cell apoptosis. Menadione at dose of 80 micro M induced both apoptosis and necrosis. At a 160 micro M dosage, menadione induced cell necrosis. Caspase 3 activation is required for menadione-induced apoptosis. Incubation of cells with 40 micro M menadione resulted in the depletion of cellular glutathione and increased lipid peroxidation. Pre-treatment of cells with cysteine suppressed the menadione-induced apoptosis and prevented changes in reactive oxygen species levels, glutathione levels and lipid peroxidation. Pre-treatment of cells with deferoxamine mesylate, an iron chelator, also reduced both menadione-induced apoptosis and lipid peroxidation. However, this did not prevent menadione-induced glutathione depletion. Thus, the inhibition of lipid peroxidation by deferoxamine mesylate prevented apoptosis even though cellular glutathione remained depleted. Our data suggest that menadione-induced apoptosis is directly linked to iron-dependent lipid peroxidation.
