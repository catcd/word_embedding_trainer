Neuroblastoma is a childhood extracranial solid tumour that is associated with a number of genetic changes. Included in these genetic alterations are mutations in the kinase domain of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), which have been found in both somatic and familial neuroblastoma. In order to treat patients accordingly requires characterisation of these mutations in terms of their response to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Here, we report the identification and characterisation of two novel neuroblastoma ALK mutations (A1099T and R1464STOP), which we have investigated together with several previously reported but uncharacterised ALK mutations (T1087I, D1091N, T1151M, M1166R, F1174I and A1234T). In order to understand the potential role of these ALK mutations in neuroblastoma progression, we have employed cell culture-based systems together with the model organism Drosophila as a readout for ligand-independent activity. Mutation of ALK at position 1174 (F1174I) generates a gain-of-function receptor capable of activating intracellular targets such as ERK (extracellular signal regulated kinase) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) in a ligand-independent manner. Analysis of these previously uncharacterised ALK mutants and comparison with ALK(F1174) mutants suggests that ALK mutations observed in neuroblastoma fall into three classes. These classes are: (i) gain-of-function ligand-independent mutations such as ALK(F1174l), (ii) kinase-dead ALK mutants, e.g. ALK(I1250T) (Sch√∂nherr et al., 2011a) and (iii) ALK mutations that are ligand-dependent in nature. Irrespective of the nature of the observed ALK mutants, in every case the activity of the mutant ALK receptors could be abrogated by the ALK inhibitor crizotinib (Xalkori/PF-02341066), albeit with differing levels of sensitivity.
An open study was carried out in 60 elderly patients with Parkinson's disease to assess the efficacy and tolerance of long-term treatment with levodopa/benserazide combination therapy. Patients were treated for periods up to 2 years, doses being titrated to the lowest required to bring about adequate relief of symptoms. The mean daily dose ranged from 165 mg on entry to 199 mg in the 43 patients assessed at 24 months. The results showed that treatment provided lasting therapeutic benefits for approximately three-quarters of the study population with a low incidence of side-effects.
Two cases of documented torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia in association with the use of disopyramide are described. One patient had previously experienced an episode suggestive of quinidine induced ventricular tachycardia while the other developed ventricular tachycardia during quinidine treatment which was later exacerbated and sustained by the administration of disopyramide. Both patients exhibited a prolonged QTc or QUc interval at the time of the arrhythmia. These cases suggest that a propensity of ventricular arrhythmias induced by quinidine may identify individuals who are likely to develop similar arrhythmias disopyramide treatment as well.
Combinations of topoisomerase I (topo I) poisons and platinum derivatives have synergistic antitumoral effects. However, their clinical development is limited by supra-additive haematological toxicity. The aim of this study was to determine whether sustained doses of topotecan and oxaliplatin could be achieved using a synergistic sequence. 34 advanced cancer patients and 186 cycles were evaluable for toxicity over five dosing levels. Oxaliplatin at 85-110 mg/m(2) was given on day 1, followed by topotecan 0.5-1.25 mg/m(2)/day x 5 from day 1 to 5, every 3 weeks. Plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of total and ultrafiltrable platinum, total and lactone forms of topotecan were determined in the first cycle. The dose-limiting toxicity (DT) was identified as grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The occurrence of grade 4 thrombocytopenia did not correlate with topotecan PK, but it did with the patient's characteristics. Severe thrombocytopenia was seen in 1/8 of patients without clinical or biological evidence of malnutrition, with a creatinine clearance higher than 1 ml/s, and no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens, while it was seen in 8/10 patients with one of these characteristics (P<0.004). In conclusion, the recommended doses of oxaliplatin 110 mg/m(2) and topotecan 1 mg/m(2)/day, every 3 weeks can be administered to patients with a favourable general status and pretreatment characteristics and a phase II study is worthwhile in ovarian cancer patients.
Withdrawal from long-term treatment with benzodiazepines was followed in three patients by a severe delusional depression. The delusional depression may be related to the neurotransmitter changes accompanying benzodiazepine withdrawal. Caution should be exercised in long-term use of benzodiazepines in susceptible individuals.
Five cases scheduled for myocardial elective coronary artery bypass (CAB), who developed angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes, after oral administration of dipyridamole (100 mg) are reported. Dipyridamole induced myocardial ischemia has been demonstrated in subjects with coronary artery disease, if this drug is administered intravenously. To our knowledge, only one study reported this side effect, after oral route, in four patients awaiting urgent CAB, for unstable angina. Based on our and other Authors experience, preoperative dipyridamole should be used with caution, especially in patients with unstable angina.
Repeated intraperitoneal administration of benzene (1.0 ml/kg body wt.) for 3 days produced leucopenia, lymphocytopenia and significantly decreased body wt. (P less than 0.001) and organ weights of thymus (P less than 0.001) and spleen (P less than 0.001) in female albino rats. Total iron content, lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase activity of the liver and bone marrow were significantly increased as a result of benzene exposure. Low molecular weight (LMW) bleomycin detectable iron content was accumulated in bone marrow, whereas hepatic LMW iron was not detectable after benzene intoxication to rats. Prior administration of single dose (250 micrograms/100 g body wt.) of Poly IC, an interferon inducer with immunomodulating potential was found to be ameliorate some of the adverse effects of benzene as well as restoration of hepatic architecture histologically. Superoxide dismutase activity, lipid peroxidation, total iron content and LMW iron content (bone marrow) were normalised. Pretreatment of animals with Poly IC was able to enhance the SRBC antibody titre in benzene-treated animals. This study suggests that the beneficial effects of Poly IC in the amelioration of the acute toxicity of benzene has clinical significance.
Relapse to drug use in humans can be induced by exposure to drug-associated cues. The ability of drug cues to provoke 'relapse' has been studied in laboratory animals using a reinstatement model in which resumption of drug seeking is assessed after extinction of drug-reinforced responding. In this model, there are no adverse consequences of drug-seeking behavior. However, in humans, abstinence is often self-imposed, and relapse episodes likely involve making a choice between the desire for the drug and the negative consequences of pursuing it (a conflict situation). In this paper, we describe a conflict model of cue-induced relapse in rats that approximate the human condition.
Rats were trained to lever press for cocaine; infusions were paired with a discrete light cue. An 'electric barrier' was then introduced by electrifying the floor area near the levers. Responding decreased over days with increasing shock intensities, until the rats did not approach the levers for 3 days. Subsequently, the effect of intermittent noncontingent light-cue presentations on resumption of lever responding (relapse) was assessed in extinction tests, with the electric barrier remaining activated; during testing, lever presses led to contingent light-cue presentations.
Noncontingent cue exposure led to resumption of lever presses during the relapse tests in 14 of the 24 rats. Surprisingly, 24 h later, 11 of the 24 rats resumed lever responding in a subsequent post-noncontingent cue test under similar extinction conditions. Large individual differences in responding were observed during both tests.
At its current stage of development, the conflict relapse model appears particularly suitable for studying individual differences in cue-induced relapse to cocaine seeking or factors that promote this relapse.
A case of mania associated with steroid withdrawal is described, and a possible etiology suggested. Milder cases of mood disturbance secondary to steroid withdrawal may be more common than previously recognized.
Acute renal failure (ARF) is an uncommon complication in children with nephrotic syndrome. We report here the case of a 10-year-old male child with primary steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome who was non-responsive to steroids and cyclophosphamide. A kidney biopsy revealed that he had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. His treatment was initiated with tacrolimus (dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day) in two divided doses along with prednisolone 60 mg/m(2)/daily. After 1 month of treatment, he was diagnosed as having acute renal failure secondary to HUS. This was postulated to be due to the tacrolimus therapy, which was withdrawn. Two weeks after stopping the adminsitration of tacrolimus, his urine output improved, and the hemoglobin and serum creatinine normalized. Thus, tacrolimus-induced HUS is a rare cause of ARF in nephrotic syndrome. With the increasing use of tacrolimus in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, the treating physicians need to be aware of this rare, but potentially life-threatening side effect.
In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension the administration of a vasodilating drug is often used to test pulmonary vasoreactivity. Hydralazine has been employed as a test drug, but because of its long duration of action there is a risk of sustained systemic arterial hypotension in patients with a fixed pulmonary vascular resistance. In this study we compared the acute hemodynamic effects of intravenous prostacyclin, a potent, short-acting vasodilator, with the effects of oral or intravenous hydralazine. Both prostacyclin and hydralazine increased cardiac output and decreased systemic pressure without changing pulmonary arterial pressure in seven patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. The average decrease in total pulmonary resistance with prostacyclin (-46% +/- 5%) was more than that with hydralazine (-32% +/- 6%). The respective decreases in total systemic resistance were -50% +/- 4% vs -43% +/- 6%. The percent changes in individual responses to the two agents were correlated (p less than 0.05) for pulmonary arterial pressure, systemic arterial pressure, total pulmonary resistance, and total systemic resistance. We concluded that the pulmonary hemodynamic effects of prostacyclin resembled those of hydralazine. Prostacyclin may predict the acute pulmonary hemodynamic effects of hydralazine in primary pulmonary hypertension and because of its prompt, brief action may provide greater patient safety.
The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory effects among emergency services first responders and residents with exposure to combustion products in the aftermath of a chemical waste depot fire.
The study population comprised 138 individuals who were present in the area downwind of an accidental fire. Identified by telephone interview six years later, subjects with persistent respiratory symptoms were suspected as having Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS). Medical tests were performed. For bronchial responsiveness, a cut-off point of PD (20)<2.39 mg histamine was taken and a dose-response slope (DRS) was calculated. Suspected RADS cases were compared with healthy controls for exposure to combustion products, lung function, and bronchial responsiveness.
The 25 suspected RADS cases were more frequently exposed than the 99 controls; the crude odds ratio for high versus low exposure was 6.5 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.4-18.0]. Suspected cases showed a lower ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC; P=0.028). Overall, suspected cases had higher DRS than controls. The difference was significant for males only (P=0.006), and non-smoking males (P=0.014). Highly exposed subjects had higher DRS than low exposed subjects (P=0.056). These differences were significant when restricted to non-smokers (P=0.034) and to males (P=0.019). Differences between cases and controls were stronger when the population was restricted to current non-smokers.
Persistent respiratory symptoms and bronchial responsiveness were associated with exposure to combustion products of a chemical waste depot fire which occurred more than six years earlier. Authorities and emergency services are recommended to take this into consideration when managing incidents in order to limit possible exposure to airway irritants.
Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity determines biotransformation of azathioprine and, thereby, drug efficacy and safety. Evaluation of a possible long-term effect of mesalazine or azathioprine on TPMT activity is of particular clinical importance because both drugs can to be given for several years in inflammatory bowel disease. Monitoring of TPMT activity and three thiopurine metabolites was performed prospectively during a 1 year postoperative period in 21 patients with Crohn's disease randomly assigned to azathioprine (2.0-2.5 mg/kg per day) or mesalazine (4 g/day). TPMT activity did not change significantly within each treatment group during 52 weeks. At any study visit, TPMT activity was not different between 13 patients on azathioprine and eight patients on mesalazine. Concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN, active moiety of azathioprine) and 6-methyl-mercaptopurine ribonucleotides (6-MMPR) did not alter significantly during the observation period, except for a slight decrease in 6-TGN levels when comparing the first with the last visit. In this first report of serial monitoring of 6-methyl-thioguanine nucleotides (6-MTGN) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease taking azathioprine, high levels of 6-TGN were correlated with high levels of 6-MTGN, with the mean 6-TGN:6-MTGN ratio being 2.4. In a well-standardized clinical setting of inflammatory bowel disease, neither mesalazine nor azathioprine significantly affected TPMT activity during a whole year of treatment.
The expression of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) in rats with lithium (Li)-induced polyuria was examined by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. The state of the thyroid axis in these rats was also examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) mRNAs and radioimmunoassay for circulating thyroid hormones. Adult male Wistar rats consuming a diet that contained LiCl (60 mmol/kg) for 4 weeks developed remarkable polyuria. The urine in the Li-treated rats was hypotonic and had a large volume and low ionic concentration. The nNOS mRNA in the PVN and SON was significantly increased in the Li-treated rats in comparison with that in control. The increased levels of the nNOS mRNA in the PVN and SON were confirmed by NADPH-diaphorase histochemical staining. There were no differences of TRH mRNA in the PVN, TSH mRNA in the anterior pituitary and plasma concentrations of free T3 and free T4 between Li-treated rats and control rats. These results suggest that Li-induced diabetes insipidus may activate nNOS in the PVN and SON without change of the thyroid axis.
Fenbufen is a phenylalkanoic acid derivative with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-inflammatory activity appears to reside in the metabolites. Published data indicate that fenbufen 600 to 1000mg daily is comparable in effectiveness to therapeutic doses (3 to 4g) of aspirin, indomethacin (75 to 100mg) or phenylbutazone (300 to 400mg) in rheumatoid arthritis, but generally causes fewer side effects. At a daily dosage of 600mg, fenbufen is comparable with aspirin 3.6g or indomethacin 75mg in osteoarthritis. Initial studies suggest that fenbufen 600 to 900mg daily is at least as effective as ibuprofen 1200 to 1800mg of fenoprofen 1800 to 2400mg daily. It has not been compared with naproxen or sulindac in adequate numbers of patients. Fenbufen is effective when given twice daily and there is some evidence that once daily dosage is adequate in known responders to the drug. As with other non-steroidal alkanoic acid drugs, gastrointestinal complaints are the most frequently reported side effects, but there have been no reports of peptic ulcer to date.
Mulberry extracts are antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic, as well as preventive of cardiovascular disease. The current study investigates the protective mechanisms of mulberry water extracts (MWEs) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced hepatic injury. Oral administration of MWEs significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation triggered by CCl(4), as shown by the reduced production of thiobarituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS). The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were also reduced via cotreatment with MWEs compared with CCl(4) treatment alone. Cotreatment with MWE evidently reduced CCl(4)-induced liver weight and inhibited lipid deposition and fibrogenesis. In a similar manner, cotreatment with silymarin, a well-known liver protective agent, also reversed the CCl(4)-induced effects, such as reduced TBARS formation, decreased serum AST, ALT, and ALP levels, blocked lipid accumulation, and liver fibrosis. Furthermore, MWEs attenuated the proinflammatory genes such as cyclooxygenase 2, nuclear factor kappa B, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. The current findings suggest that MWEs such as silymarin exhibit protective and curative effects against CCl(4)-induced liver damage and fibrosis via decreased lipid peroxidation and inhibited proinflammatory gene expression.
Dural sinus thrombosis has not been described in a patient with hypernatremia resulting from lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. A 63-year-old man on chronic lithium therapy for schizoaffective disorder was transferred to the Emergency Department with dehydration and signs of central nervous system dysfunction after a 3-week isolation in a room in a psychiatric hospital due to exacerbation of psychiatric disorder, during which he refused to eat. Laboratory examination revealed hypertonic hypernatremia (osmolality, 359 mOsm/kg and Na, 171 mEq/L) and hyposthenuria (specific gravity, 1.010 and osmolality, 249 mOsm/kg), with normal serum endogenous vasopressin concentration (2.3 pg/mL). The serum lithium concentration was within the therapeutic range (0.94 mEq/L). Cranial computed tomography demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage and suggested dural sinus thrombosis. Although treatment with indomethacin (25 mg parenterally at 8-hour intervals) was somewhat effective in restoring renal concentrating capacity, he died of massive hemorrhagic infarction on the sixth hospital day, probably secondary to dural sinus thrombosis. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem examination. Physicians should be alert for the possibility of dural sinus thrombosis as a complication of hypernatremia resulting from lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an inherited recessive disorder characterized by progressive neurological disability and heart abnormalities. The Friedreich ataxia gene (FRDA) encodes a small mitochondrial protein, frataxin, which is produced in insufficient amounts in the disease as a consequence of a GAA triplet repeat expansion in the first intron of the gene. Frataxin deficiency leads to excessive free radical production, dysfunction of Fe-S center containing enzymes (in particular respiratory complexes I, II and III, and aconitase), and progressive iron accumulation in mitochondria. Frataxin may be a mitochondrial iron-binding protein that prevents this metal from participating in Fenton chemistry to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals. We investigated whether frataxin deficiency may in addition interfere with signaling pathways. First, we showed that exposure of FA fibroblasts to iron fails to produce the normally observed increase in expression of the stress defense protein manganese superoxide dismutase. This impaired induction involves a nuclear factor-kappaB-independent pathway that does not require free radical signaling intermediates. We also examined the role of frataxin in neuronal differentiation by using stably transfected clones of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells with antisense or sense frataxin constructs. We found that during retinoic acid-induced neurogenesis frataxin deficiency enhances apoptosis and reduces the number of terminally differentiated neuronal-like cells. The addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine only rescues cells non-committed to the neuronal lineage, indicating that frataxin deficiency impairs differentiation mechanisms and survival responses through different mechanisms. Both studies suggest that some abnormalities in frataxin-deficient cells are related to free radical independent signaling pathways.
Controlled hypotension which is used during scoliosis surgery to improve operating conditions and minimize transfusion requirements may decrease spinal cord blood flow (SCBF). Previous studies using hydrogen washout, an invasive technique, have shown that trimethaphan-induced hypotension is associated with a decrease in SCBF, whereas hypotension induced with sodium nitroprusside or nitroglycerin is not. To determine whether the decrease seen with trimethaphan represented a generalized rather than regional spinal cord phenomenon, SCBF was measured at three separate cord levels (T2-3, 7-8, L2-3) using a noninvasive radionuclide-labelled microsphere technique. When the mean arterial pressure was reduced by 50%, SCBF decreased 35 to 45% at all levels of the cord examined, and remained at this reduced level during the period of hypotension. The results confirm that trimethaphan-induced hypotension is associated with a significant reduction in SCBF and that this occurs throughout the spinal cord during the period of hypotension.
The occurrence of phlebitis, thrombosis, and thrombophlebitis after intravenous premedication with diazepam (0.15 mg/kg) dissolved in propylene glycol (Valium) or in polyethylene glycol (Diapam) or flunitrazepam (0.0125 mg/kg), and after intravenous induction of balanced general anaesthesia with thiopentone (4.0 mg/kg) or etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) was studied on the 7th and 14th postoperative days in 115 patients undergoing short-stay varicose vein surgery. Venous complications occurred most frequently after etomidate (43% at 14 days), thiopentone (23% at 14 days), and Valium (21% at 7 days). Diapam caused fewer venous sequelae (9% at 14 days) than Valium (18% at 14 days), but the smallest number of complications were noticed after flunitrazepam (8% at 7 days and none at 14 days). Venous sequelae were more severe and more extended after thiopentone and after etomidate than those after the diazepam preparations. It is concluded that venous complications after flunitrazepam premedication were mild and infrequent and that the incidence of such complications was unacceptably high after etomidate induction.
Dyskinesia is a recognized but uncommon side-effect of treatment with phenytoin. Two additional cases of dyskinesia during treatment with phenytoin are described; both had radiographically documented thalamic infarctions. The reported experience to date with movement disorders induced by phenytoin is reviewed and the clinical features summarized. The available experimental evidence addressing the mechanism underlying this side effect is discussed.
To investigate the relationship of fragile histidine triad (FHIT) and Ki-67 expression with clinicopathological variables of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 30 asbestos induced MPM (epithelial and biphasic) patients were examined for FHIT and Ki-67 expression using immunohistochemical techniques and results were compared with clinicopathological variables.
Immunohistochemical study results were as follows: 12 (40%) cases showed low FHIT expression and 18 (60%) showed high expression. There was no significant relationship between FHIT and age, gender or histological subtypes (p > 0.05). Ki-67 expression was 'low' in 13 (43.3%) cases and 'high' in 17 (56.7%) cases. No correlation could be demonstrated between Ki-67 expression and age, gender or histological subtypes (p > 0.05). No significant association was observed between FHIT and Ki-67 expression in MPM.
The results support the role of FHIT as a tumour suppressor gene in asbestos induced MPM. There is no significant correlation between FHIT and cell proliferation marker expressions in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Therefore, it can be concluded that loss of FHIT does not interfere with tumour proliferation. This can be accepted as evidence for an early role of FHIT loss in carcinogenesis; however, it needs to be strengthened by further studies.
A 43-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for myalgic pain and erythema of the face and thighs. She had been diagnosed with dermatomyositis at another hospital 8 years earlier and proteinuria had developed suddenly. Renal histological examination revealed membranous nephropathy. Membranous nephropathy associated with dermatomyositis is very rare. To date, malignant disease has not been detected in our patient, but the serum level of CA125, a tumor marker, has been elevated to 1,097 U/ml. The increased CA125 level is related to the degree of proteinuria and after prednisolone and cyclosporine therapy, proteinuria and the CA125 level gradually decreased.
Reversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase improve spatial learning and memory in animal models of cognitive impairment. Here we investigate if the beneficial effects of free radical scavenger N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) on cognitive performance could be explained by its recently discovered anticholinesterase activity. Morris water maze experiment was performed to examine the effect of PBN on the impairment of spatial learning and memory induced by the antagonist of cholinergic muscarinic transmission scopolamine. In situ hybridization histochemistry experiment was performed to study its effects on the induction of immediate early gene expression (c-fos, c-jun) by dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF-82958 and on the augmentation of the SKF-82958-induced expression of these genes by scopolamine. In both experiments, the effects of PBN were compared to the effects of reversible anticholinesterase physostigmine. We found that physostigmine but not PBN significantly reversed the cognitive impairment in scopolamine-challenged rats, prevented the induction of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs by SKF-82958 and attenuated the augmentation of the SKF-82958-induced expression of these genes by scopolamine. The present experiments did not reveal a significant in vivo anticholinesterase activity of PBN.
This case of an adult with cimetidine-induced hepatitis is presented. An etiologic role for the drug was strongly suggested when the patient developed transient hepatic dysfunction after two reexposures to cimetidine, which reverted promptly on withdrawal of the drug. The temporal relation between the administration of the drug and the development of hepatic dysfunction suggests that it is a hypersensitivity type of reaction.
