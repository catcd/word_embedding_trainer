Atypical antipsychotics have a favourable risk/benefit profile in early onset schizophrenia (EOS). However, despite increasing use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents, their endocrine and metabolic side-effects (weight gain, obesity, and related metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycaemia and dyslipidemia) are of particular concern, especially within this paediatric population that appears to be at greater risk as compared with adults for antipsychotic-induced metabolic adverse effects. In addition to medication, many factors contribute to weigh gain in psychiatric patients, including sedentary lifestyle and poor diet. Excessive weigh gain has several deleterious effects in psychiatric patients, including stigmatization and further social withdrawal, and non compliance with medication. Furthermore, excessive corpulence may evolve to a metabolic syndrome with a high-risk state for future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adult age. Because youths are still developing at the time of psychotropic drug exposure, in a context of physiological changes in hormonal and endocrines levels and body composition, most reference values need to be adjusted for gender, age and growth charts. Hence, sex- and age-adjusted BMI percentiles and BMI Z scores are crucial to assess weight gain in children and adolescents.
Obesity thresholds have been proposed to define "at risk" categories of patients. In recently issued guidelines, thresholds for antipsychotic-induced weight gain in adults have been set at a 5% increase or one point increase in BMI unit. To date, no definition has reached a consensus in childhood and adolescence. However, some at risk states requiring action are proposed in literature: more than 5% increase in weight within a three-month period; more than half a point increase in BMI Z score; between 85th and 95th BMI percentile plus one adverse health consequence (i.e. hyperglycaemia, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, or orthopaedic, gallbladder, or sleep disorder); or more than 95th BMI percentile or abdominal obesity (i.e. abdominal circumference above 90th percentile). As a matter of fact, numerous studies that have assessed weight gain during antipsychotic treatment are clearly limited, either because of their short duration (a few weeks), or because of their methodology: indeed, only weight gain is generally reported as an assessment tool. Merely noting an increase in body weight over time does not in itself signify a problem, and may underscore the importance of excessive corpulence growth as compared with controls. Adjusted BMI percentiles and BMI Z scores were calculated in only a few studies.
This pilot study focuses on the metabolic effects of risperidone in children and adolescents up to 16 years of age. This study is part of a larger, regional study on metabolic side effects of antipsychotic medication in adults, promoted by the university hospital centre in Lille, France.
Patients included in the study were referred to our department of child and adolescent psychiatry for EOS (K-SADS). They had received no antipsychotic treatment prior to their inclusion. Weight, height, sex- and age-related BMI percentiles and BMI Z scores, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting triglyceride levels, fasting total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and fasting glucose level were measured at M0, M3, and M6. BMI, sex- and age-related BMI percentiles and adjusted BMI Z scores were obtained from tables and calculator (www.kidsnutrition.org).
Twenty-six children and adolescents (21 males, five females) aged 7 to 15.5 years (mean=12.9 years, sd=2.3) were included. They all received a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-aged children (K-SADS). They all received risperidone from 1mg/day to a maximum of 6 mg/day. Statistical analysis principally shows a significant link between prescription of risperidone in EOS and six-months increases of BMI (increase of 4.7 kg/m(2), p<0.0001), sex- and age-adjusted BMI percentile (increase of 29.3 points, p<0.0025), and BMI Z scores (increase of 1.1 point, p<0.0001). No patient showed metabolic syndrome, but one girl presented with a 1g/l increase of fasting total cholesterol at two-months.
Despite the limited number of children included, our results confirm a strong link between prescription of risperidone in EOS and risk of obesity. Clinicians and caregivers need to be aware of the potential endocrine and metabolic adverse effects of atypical antipsychotics, and systematically ask for family history of metabolic disorder, life style, diet and habits. With adolescents, the sole monitoring of weight gain, and even of BMI, underestimates the gain of corpulence. One methodological implication of our study is that adjusted BMI Z scores are the best-suited measure to assess long-term drug-induced weight gain in comparison to developmental changes.
Alternative treatment should be considered in some cases. Other antipsychotics, like aripiprazole, may have a better benefit/risk ratio and then may be prescribed as a first prescription or as a switch. Associations of antipsychotics may also be of interest but we lack controlled studies in children and adolescents. In some cases, alternative treatments like repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulations (rTMS) may be required. Their efficacy and their place in the therapeutic strategy of pharmacoresistant schizophrenia in children and adolescents have to be assessed in regard to metabolic and blood side effects of clozapine.
Acrylamide is a type-2 alkene monomer with established human neurotoxic effects. While the primary source of human exposure to acrylamide is occupational, other exposure sources include food, drinking water, and smoking. In this study, neurobehavioral assays coupled with transcriptional profiling analysis were conducted to assess both behavioral and gene expression effects induced by acrylamide neurotoxicity in juvenile rats. Acrylamide administration in rat pups induced significant characteristic neurotoxic symptoms including increased heel splay, decrease in grip strength, and decrease in locomotor activity. Transcriptome analysis with the Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 array indicated that acrylamide treatment caused a significant alteration in the expression of a few genes that are involved in muscle contraction, pain, and dopaminergic neuronal pathways. First, expression of the Mylpf gene involved in muscle contraction was downregulated in the spinal cord in response to acrylamide. Second, in sciatic nerves, acrylamide repressed the expression of the opioid receptor gene Oprk1 that is known to play a role in neuropathic pain regulation. Finally, in the cerebellum, acrylamide treatment caused a decrease in the expression of the nuclear receptor gene Nr4a2 that is required for development of dopaminergic neurons. Thus, our work examining the effect of acrylamide at the whole-genome level on a developmental mammalian model has identified a few genes previously not implicated in acrylamide neurotoxicity that might be further developed into biomarkers for assessing the risk of adverse health effects induced by acrylamide exposure.
The authors describe a case of tardive dyskinesia and parkinsonism associated with amoxapine. Patients who develop acute parkinsonism while taking amoxapine may be at higher risk for tardive dyskinesia. The authors recommend that amoxapine be prescribed as carefully as other neuroleptics.
To investigate the protective role of heme oxygenase-1 and its reaction product, carbon monoxide against acute liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.
Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups with five in each. The control group received a single dose of corn oil injection. Carbon tetrachloride was injected intraperitoneally (i.p) to establish acute liver injury models in rats. Hemin(50 micromol/kg) was administered i.p. 12 hours before CCl(4) treatment, with an aim to induce HO-1 protein expression in the liver of rats. Carbon monoxide was injected i.p. 12 hours prior to CCl(4) injection, resulting in about 8%-12% carboxyhemoglobin concentration in vivo. The expression of HO-1 in the liver of hemin-treated rats was determined by western blot method at different time points. At 24 h after carbon tetrachloride administration, all rats were sacrificed to collect blood samples for the examination of ALT, AST levels and to remove liver tissues for analysis of MDA concentration, SOD activity and caspase-3 activity as well as TNF-alpha contents. In addition, histopathological changes were investigated and hepatocyte apoptosis was detected by TUNEL method.
The administration of carbon tetrachloride to rats caused a marked hepatic damage, characterized by significant elevation of serum ALT, AST levels(2 136.3+/-163.4 U, 1 422.7+/-221.7 U) and liver MDA content(5.28+/-0.93 micromol/g), caspase-3 activity (optical density value 4.69+/-1.02) and TNF-alpha level(256.3+/-27.3 ng/L) combined with a remarkable reduction in liver SOD activity (45.9+/-14.8 U/mg) as compared with the control rats. Histopathological observations revealed severe damage in the liver and prominent hepatocyte apoptosis took place in CCl(4) -treated rats. However, pretreatment with hemin could induce high expression of HO-1 protein and exert potent protective effects against liver injury, as demonstrated by a significant decrease in ALT, AST levels(287.1+/-24.3 U, 246.2+/- 21.7 U) and MDA concentration(3.27+/-1.34 micromol/g), reduction in caspase-3 activity(optical density value 2.49+/-1.47) and TNF-alpha level(132.6+/-19.5 ng/L), as compared with the CCl(4) -treated rats. Moreover, hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury were both attenuated remarkably in the liver of rats pretreated with hemin. In contrast to hemin administration, single injection of exogenous CO produced the same protective effects, as indicated by the remarkable reduction of ALT, AST levels and caspase-3 activity and TNF-alpha levels.
The above results suggest that HO-1/CO system has a potent protective effect on acute liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats. Induction of HO-1 expression and low concentration of CO can inhibit the progress of hepatic damage, which might be due to the alleviation of lipid peroxidation and reduction of caspase-3 activity or inhibition of TNF-alpha level.
The influence of anaesthesia in experimental stroke research is controversial. We addressed this problem using the model of endothelin-1-induced occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (eMCAO). This model provided the opportunity to compare the infarct volumes of rats which were under halothane anaesthesia during eMCAO induction with the lesions of rats which were without anaesthesia during eMCAO. All animals were implanted with guide cannulae which allowed the induction of ischaemia in freely moving animals. For comparison, one group of animals was exposed to halothane during the induction of ischaemia. Seven days after eMCAO, the average infarct volume of halothane-anaesthetised rats was significantly larger than the lesion in freely moving animals. This difference was mainly due to increased cortical damage, whereas the striatum was much less influenced. The cortical infarct volume 21 days after induction of eMCAO under anaesthesia was significantly reduced compared to the infarct volume 7 days after eMCAO under anaesthesia. Our results indicate that halothane anaesthesia during eMCAO can cause a transient cortical increase in ischaemic infarct volume. The influence of volatile anaesthetics on ischaemic pathophysiology should be taken into consideration when preclinically testing potential neuroprotective drugs for clinical applications.
We examined the antioxidant properties in vitro and the antinociceptive effect of carvacrol (CARV) in several models of pain in mice. CARV presented a strong antioxidant potential according to the TRAP/TAR evaluation; it also presented scavenger activity against nitric oxide and prevented lipid peroxidation in vitro. In mice, when evaluated against acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing, CARV (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced (p < 0.001) the number of writhing compared to the control group, without opioid participation. In the formalin test, CARV also significantly inhibited both the early (neurogenic pain) and the late (inflammatory pain) phases of formalin-induced licking, with inhibition percentage values of 56.8% (100 mg/kg) for the neurogenic phase and 41.2% (25 mg/kg), 73.8% (50 mg/kg) and 99.7% (100 mg/kg) for the inflammatory phase. CARV also produced a significant inhibition of the pain caused by capsaicin (63.1, 67.1 and 95.8%, p < 0.001) and glutamate (46.4, 61.4 and 97.9%, p < 0.01). When assessed in a thermal model of pain, CARV (100 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the latency response on the hot-plate test. Such results were unlikely to be provoked by motor abnormality. Together, these results indicate that the properties of CARV should be more thoroughly examined in order to achieve newer tools for management and/or treatment of painful conditions, including those related to pro-oxidant states.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of royal jelly on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats.
Adult male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into eight groups: the control, cisplatin, royal jelly, and royal jelly plus cisplatin groups. Biochemical and histopathological methods were utilized for evaluation of the nephrotoxicity. Blood was collected and analyzed for blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, total bilirubin, and total protein levels. The kidney samples were stored for the measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities and processed for histopathological examinations.
Administration of cisplatin to rats induced a marked renal failure, characterized with a significant increase in serum BUN and uric acid concentrations, and they had higher kidney MDA and lower GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT activities. In the groups that were administered RJ in association with CP, improvement was observed in some oxidative stress parameters and certain other biochemical parameters, pre-treatment with RJ being more effective.
The CP-induced changes in histopathologic findings of kidneys were partially reversed by treatment with royal jelly. The results provide further insight into the mechanisms of CP-induced nephrotoxicity and confirm the antioxidant potential of royal jelly.
Orally administered levodopa remains the most effective symptomatic treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). The introduction of levodopa therapy is often delayed, however, because of the fear that it might be toxic for the remaining dopaminergic neurons and, thus, accelerate the deterioration of patients. However, in vivo evidence of levodopa toxicity is scarce. We have evaluated the effects of a 6-month oral levodopa treatment on several dopaminergic markers, in rats with moderate or severe 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions of mesencephalic dopamine neurons and sham-lesioned animals. Counts of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area showed no significant difference between levodopa-treated and vehicle-treated rats. In addition, for rats of the sham-lesioned and severely lesioned groups, immunoradiolabeling for TH, the dopamine transporter (DAT), and the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) at the striatal level was not significantly different between rats treated with levodopa or vehicle. It was unexpected that quantification of immunoautoradiograms showed a partial recovery of all three dopaminergic markers (TH, DAT, and VMAT2) in the denervated territories of the striatum of moderately lesioned rats receiving levodopa. Furthermore, the density of TH-positive fibers observed in moderately lesioned rats was higher in those treated chronically with levodopa than in those receiving vehicle. Last, that chronic levodopa administration reversed the up-regulation of D2 dopamine receptors seen in severely lesioned rats provided evidence that levodopa reached a biologically active concentration at the basal ganglia. Our results demonstrate that a pharmacologically effective 6-month oral levodopa treatment is not toxic for remaining dopamine neurons in a rat model of PD but instead promotes the recovery of striatal innervation in rats with partial lesions.
In alcoholism, both relapse to alcohol drinking and treatment response are suggested to be genetically modulated. This study set out to determine whether the top 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of a recent genome-wide association (GWA) and follow-up study of alcohol dependence are associated with relapse behavior and pharmacological treatment response in 374 alcohol-dependent subjects who underwent a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with acamprosate, naltrexone or placebo. The single nucleotide polymorphism, rs13273672, an intronic SNP in the gene for GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4), was associated with relapse within the 90-day medical treatment period (P<0.01). Subsequent pharmacogenetic analyses showed that this association was mainly based on patients treated with acamprosate (P<0.01). In line with the observation that natriuretic peptide promoters are modulated by GATA4, a significant gene dose effect on the variance of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) plasma concentration in the different GATA4 genotypes (P<0.01) was found. Hence, genetic variations in GATA4 might influence relapse and treatment response to acamprosate in alcohol-dependent patients via modulation of ANP plasma levels. These results could help to identify those alcohol-dependent patients who may be at an increased risk of relapse and who may better respond to treatment with acamprosate.
A chronic schizophrenic patient developed a fatal agranulocytosis 1 month after beginning to take carbamazepine for aggression. Routine hematological monitoring was not carried out. This case highlights the need for psychiatrists' increased awareness of the possible hematological complications of carbamazepine.
A paraplegic man with no history of psychiatric illness developed psychosis and dyskinesia following abrupt withdrawal of baclofen; the symptoms resolved 72 hours after resumption of the drug. The psychosis and dyskinesia may have been a manifestation of baclofen's alteration of cerebral dopaminergic mechanisms.
In 8 healthy patients (ASA I-II) there was analyzed the effect of salbutamol over serum levels of potassium, glucose, insulin, AMPc and GMPc. Also were determined the arterial blood pressure and heart rate. The drug was administered intravenously, as bronchodilator, during the preoperative period. There was a significant decrease in kaliemia (p less than 0.001 immediately after receiving the salbutamol infusion and p less than 0.05 at 60 min). Their plasma potassium levels dropped from 4.03 +/- 25 to 3.45 +/- 0.16 mEq.l-1. The plasma levels of glucose and insulin increased with a significance of p less than 0.001 post salbutamol perfusion. There were no changes in the plasmatic AMPc and GMPc. Heart rate increased from 67 +/- 10.8 to 80.5 +/- 13.7 (p less than 0.01) post perfusion, returning afterwards to their basal values. Arterial blood pressure was unmodified.
The tibial nerve injury model is a novel, surgically uncomplicated, rat model of neuropathic pain based on a unilateral transection (neurotomy) of the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve. The aim of the present study was to describe some behavioral and molecular features of the model, and to test its sensitivity to a number of drugs which are currently used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The model was characterized by a pronounced mechanical allodynia which was present in all subjects and a less robust thermal hyperalgesia. Mechanical allodynia developed within 2 weeks post-surgery and was reliably present for at least 9 weeks. Neurotomized rats showed no autotomy and their body weight developed normally. Gene expression in ipsilateral L5 dorsal root ganglia, analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), showed a pronounced up-regulation of galanin and vasointestinal peptide (VIP). This up-regulation developed rapidly (within 1 to 2 days following neurotomy) and remained present for at least 12 days. On the other hand, expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P mRNA was down-regulated 12 days following neurotomy. Mechanical allodynia was completely reversed by morphine [minimal effective dose (MED): 8 mg/kg, i.p.] and partially reversed by carbamazepine (MED: 64 mg/kg, i.p.), baclofen (MED: 3 mg/kg, i.p.) and amitriptyline (trend for efficacy at 32 mg/kg, i.p.), but not by gabapentin (50-100 mg/kg, i.p.). The finding that the tibial nerve injury model shows a robust and persistent mechanical allodynia which is sensitive to a number of established analgesics, as well as a gene expression profile which is compatible with that obtained in other models of neuropathic pain, further supports its validity as a reliable and surgically uncomplicated model for the study of neuropathic pain.
Infective endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is increasing. Vancomycin and teicoplanin are 2 intravenous glycopeptides appropriate for its treatment. There is no human study comparing teicoplanin and vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA endocarditis. Between 1996 and 2006, 51 MRSA endocarditis patients were treated at the authors' hospital. There were 29 patients with nosocomial infection; 15 were treated with teicoplanin. Teicoplanin was used as the first therapeutic agent in 3 patients because of renal insufficiency. Vancomycin was used as the first therapeutic agent in 12 patients. Treatment was changed to teicoplanin because of adverse reactions in 10 and persistent bacteremia in 2 patients. Early operation was performed in 2 patients because of persistent MRSA bacteremia. Overall, 7 patients died in hospital. There was no statistically significant difference in hospital mortality rate (42% vs 47%) and bacteriologic failure rate (34% vs 40%) between 36 patients treated with vancomycin and 15 patients treated with teicoplanin. Teicoplanin can be an alternative therapy of MRSA infective endocarditis.
Fetal exposure to primidone was associated with Goldenhar syndrome, hemifacial microsomia, tetralogy of Fallot, aqueductal stenosis, and anterior encephalocele in this male infant. No similar cases in anticonvulsant-exposed pregnancies were found on literature review, despite the increased incidence of other anomalies following such exposure. Goldenhar syndrome, especially related to rare central nervous system anomalies, is reviewed. Experimental production of hemifacial microsomia by a folic acid antagonist, triaxene, is mediated via hemorrhage in the fetus. Intraventricular hemorrhage was noted in this infant as were dilated lateral and third ventricles. The hemorrhagic diathesis and/or the folic acid depletion of newborns following fetal anticonvulsant exposure may have been the underlying mechanism.
Relative effects of dosage, volume and concentration of local anaesthetics used for postoperative thoracic epidural analgesia are still under debate. In this randomized, prospective, double-blinded study, we evaluated the incidence of side-effects such as changes in arterial pressure, postoperative nausea, vomiting, and pruritus in patients admitted for thoracic surgery during continuous thoracic epidural infusion using levobupivacaine and sufentanil mixture in three different volumes.
We studied 150 patients who underwent thoracotomy with a thoracic epidural catheter placed between T4 and T7. The patients were randomized into three groups which received 10 mg h(-1) of levobupivacaine at three different concentrations (0.5%, 0.25%, and 0.15%), in combination with sufentanil at 2.6 microg h(-1). Haemodynamic effects, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, sensory and motor block, pain score, additional analgesic requirement, sedation, and patient satisfaction were registered immediately after the surgical operation and on the first, second, and third postoperative days.
We did not detect any differences in the incidence of side-effects such as changes in arterial pressure, and also postoperative nausea, vomiting, and pruritus. The three groups were also similar with regard to patient characteristics, sensory and motor block, pain score, analgesic rescue dose, sedation, and patient satisfaction.
The same dose of a mixture of levobupivacaine and sufentanil administered in three different volumes and concentrations during continuous thoracic epidural infusion for thoracotomy provided an equal incidence of adverse haemodynamic effects, nausea, vomiting, or pruritus.
Cremophor EL (CR) is a solubilizing agent and a modulator of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated anticancer multidrug resistance. The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether doxorubicin (Dox) pharmacokinetics, therapeutic activity and cardiotoxicity in Swiss albino mice is modified when combined with CR treatment. CR (2.5 ml/kg, i.p) given simultaneously with Dox (20 mg/kg, i.p.) increased Dox levels in plasma, heart, liver and kidneys of healthy mice. Using an Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)-bearing mice experimental model, CR (2.5 ml/kg) improved the survival and antitumor activity of Dox. The enhanced antitumor activity of Dox was related to a significant increase in EAC tumor cellular Dox content by CR. Furthermore, CR (1 microg/ml) potentiated the in vitro cytotoxicity of Dox in cultured EAC cells. In healthy mice, Dox-induced mortality was markedly reduced by simultaneous treatment with CR. CR enhanced DOX-induced increase in plasma lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and CPK-MB isozyme activities, as well as the cardiac malondialdehyde level. CR also increased Dox-induced focal necrotic myocardial lesions. These findings suggest that CR increased DOX antitumor activity and cardiotoxicity as a result of enhancing its bioavailability, and decreased Dox-induced mortality in mice by a mechanism not yet defined.
The contribution of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors to proteinuria is controversial. The aim was to analyse proteinuria in suboptimal kidney calcineurin inhibitor-(CNI) free de novo immunosuppression.
All patients from our centre with donors >60 years and CNI-free treatment were included (n = 108). Patients were divided into two groups: (i) SRL group: sirolimus (SRL) + prednisone + mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) + antiCD25; (ii) MMF group: prednisone + MMF w/ or w/o antiCD25 (n = 75). Follow-up was 12 months.
Donors were slightly younger in the SRL group (68 vs 71 years; P < 0.05), receptor age (67 vs 65 years) was not significantly different. Patient survival in the MMF group was 88 vs 94% in the SRL group, however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. One-year graft survival censored for death was 83% in the MMF group and 94% in the SRL group. Acute rejection rate was 45% in the MMF and 15% in the SRL group (P < 0.01). The incidence of CNI introduction was higher in the MMF-group (35 vs 5; P < 0.05). The intention-to-treat analysis revealed significant differences of proteinuria [SRL vs MMF at 12 months: 461 (163-6988) vs 270 (53-3029) mg/day], which did not exist in the on-therapy (OT) analysis [SRL vs MMF at 12 months: 357 (199-1428) vs 279 (53-3029) mg/day]. New onset nephrotic range proteinuria seemed to occur slightly more frequently in SRL patients (3/33 vs 1/75; P = 0.049), however, all four cases occurred in a context of recurrent disease, or previous drug-independent damage or non-adherence. All of these patients were converted to CNI.
SRL-based compared with MMF-based treatment in kidney transplantation with advanced age donors is associated with an acceptable outcome, however, with increased proteinuria in the intention-to-treat analysis. A large subgroup of the patients in the MMF group experienced acute rejection and required conversion to CNI.
The effects of acute and chronic oral administration of the vasodilator minoxidil on hemodynamics, oxygen consumption, exercise performance, and clinical status were investigated in 10 patients with severe, chronic heart failure refractory to digitalis and diuretic therapy. The cardiac index was 1.99 +/- 0.38 liters/min/m2 at rest and 2.88 +/- 0.79 at symptom-limited maximal exercise on conventional therapy, compared with 2.64 +/- 0.33 liters/min/m2 at rest and 3.55 +/- 0.84 at maximal exercise after short-term minoxidil administration (p less than 0.02, control versus minoxidil at both rest and exercise). Stroke volume was increased after minoxidil treatment, without significant effect on heart rate. Systemic vascular resistance was decreased by minoxidil from 2,050 +/- 722 to 1,325 +/- 374 dynes . s/cm-5 at rest and from 1,500 +/- 830 to 1,206 +/- 589 dynes . s/cm-5 at maximal exercise (p = 0.01, control versus minoxidil). No significant effect was observed on left ventricular filling, right atrial, or mean pulmonary arterial pressure, but pulmonary vascular resistance decreased both at rest and on exercise (p less than 0.05). Maximal exercise oxygen consumption increased from 8.9 +/- 3.2 ml/kg/min on conventional therapy to 10.5 +/- 2.4 on minoxidil therapy (p less than 0.03), median maximal exercise work load increased from 25 to 50 W and medium exercise duration increased from 6.0 to 9.0 minutes. On chronic minoxidil administration all 5 patients who completed a scheduled 6 week follow-up showed symptomatic improvement. However, worsening edema developed in all patients, requiring increased diuretic dosage and close supervision. Symptoms of ischemic heart disease worsened in 2 of 10 patients. We tentatively conclude that minoxidil may be a useful vasoactive agent in the pharmacologic therapy of severe chronic heart failure.
The usefulness of doxorubicin (DXR) is limited by its cardiotoxicity. In order to improve future DXR therapy by using a new antioxidant agent, an experimental study was designed. This study was undertaken to determine whether DXR-induced cardiotoxicity is prevented by erdosteine, a mucolytic agent showing antioxidant properties. Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (60 days old) were used: one group was untreated as a control; the other groups were treated with DXR (single i.p. dosage of 20 mg kg(-1) body wt.) or DXR plus erdosteine (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1), orally), respectively. The DXR treatment without erdosteine increased antioxidant enzyme activities and also increased lipid peroxidation in myocardial tissue. The rats treated with DXR plus erdosteine produced a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation in comparison with control and DXR groups. Furthermore, erdosteine administration led to an increase in antioxidant enzyme activities in comparison with the control group. Erdosteine treatment also increased the activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in comparison with the DXR group. There was no significant difference in lipid peroxidation of myocardial tissue between control and DXR plus erdosteine-treated rats. It was concluded that erdosteine caused an increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, especially GSH-Px and CAT, protecting the heart tissue sufficiently from oxidative damage to membrane lipids and other cellular components induced by DXR.
Ozone (O(3)) remains a prevalent air pollutant and public health concern. Inf2 is a significant quantitative trait locus on murine chromosome 17 that contributes to susceptibility to O(3)-induced infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) into the lung, but the mechanisms of susceptibility remain unclear. The study objectives were to confirm and restrict Inf2, and to identify and test novel candidate susceptibility gene(s). Congenic strains of mice that contained overlapping regions of Inf2 and their controls, and mice deficient in either major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes or the Tnf cluster, were exposed to air or O(3). Lung inflammation and gene expression were assessed. Inf2 was restricted from 16.42 Mbp to 0.96 Mbp, and bioinformatic analysis identified MHC class II, the Tnf cluster and other genes in this region that contain potentially informative single nucleotide polymorphisms between the susceptible and resistant mice. Furthermore, O(3)-induced inflammation was significantly reduced in mice deficient in MHC class II genes or the Tnf cluster genes, compared with wild-type controls. Gene expression differences were also observed in MHC class II and Tnf cluster genes. This integrative genetic analysis of Inf2 led to identification of novel O(3) susceptibility genes that may provide important, new therapeutic targets in susceptible individuals.
Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstrated. Thus, caffeine (3.3 mg/kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men (aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions. Borderline hypertensive men (n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg. Low-risk controls (n = 24) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening BP < 130/85 mm Hg. Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12-hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits. Caffeine-induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls (+8.4 vs +3.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance-derived measures of systemic vascular resistance (+135 vs +45 dynes.s.cm-5, p < 0.004). These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols. The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96%. Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive BP levels after caffeine ingestion. Thus, in borderline hypertensive men, exaggerated responses to caffeine were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives. We suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression, as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment.
