It was demonstrated in rats that renal injury which follows transient renal hypoxia is potentiated by the contrast media metrizoate, ioxaglate, iopamidol and iohexol. Intravenous injection of 1 g I/kg of all four media alone to 82 rats caused no significant increase in serum urea 1, 3 and 7 days later. The percentage increase of serum urea is given in median values and interquartile range (in parentheses). Bilateral renal arterial occlusion alone for 40 minutes in 42 rats increased serum urea one day later by 40 per cent (20-130). Intravenous injection of the media followed in one hour by bilateral renal arterial occlusion for 40 minutes in 104 rats caused serum urea to increase one day later by 130 per cent (70-350) after metrizoate, by 220 per cent (50-380) after ioxaglate, by 290 per cent (60-420) after iopamidol and by 160 per cent (50-330) after iohexol. There were no significant differences between the potentiating effects of the various media on ischemic renal failure.
Synaptotagmin 7 (Syt 7) is a Ca2+ sensor implicated in the regulation of membrane fusion in vesicular transport, but its precise role in neurons is still a matter of controversy. Dopaminergic drugs have been shown to modulate its expression in the striatum. Here we investigate whether dopamine receptor agonist-up-regulation of Syt 7 mRNA is specifically involved in the pathophysiological adaptations of hypersensitive striatum by analyzing other dopaminergic neurons containing brain regions. We treated rats with systemic reserpine injections that rapidly depletes dopamine throughout the brain, but leaves dopaminergic neurons spared from destruction. We analyzed the effects of apomorphine, a D1 and D2 receptor agonist on Syt 7 mRNA expression in caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, cingulate cortex, substantia nigra compacta, ventral tegmental area and hippocampus. The treatment with reserpine resulted in akinesia, catalepsy and rigidity and up-regulation of proenkephalin and down-regulation of preprotachykinin mRNA in caudate putamen, indicating a severe depletion. By acute treatment with apomorphine proenkephalin mRNA was down-regulated and preprotachykinin mRNA up-regulated in the caudate putamen of reserpinized rats. Apomorphine increased Syt 7 mRNA levels only in striatum (caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens) of reserpinized rats, while in other brain regions it did not have such effect. The reserpinization and/or apomorphine treatment had no effect on Syt 1 mRNA expression in caudate putamen. It may be concluded, that in the striatum depleted of biogene amines, such as occurs after reserpine treatment, the up-regulation of Syt 7 could play a specific role as part of hypersensitive response to dopaminergic agonists.
Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative used to treat cardiac arrhythmias. The most-common ocular symptom is colored rings around lights. Common ocular findings include comeal micro-deposits and lens opacities. An amiodarone optic neuropathy has been described. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used to treat cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. It is known to cause dyschromatopsia, visual disturbances, and visual-field defects. Digoxin serum levels and toxicity risks increase with the addition of amiodarone.
Soon after initiation of amiodarone HCl (200 mg/day), a 76-year-old man came to us with symptoms of visual "shining," glare, color vision anomalies, and gradually decreased vision. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 O.D. and 20/60 O.S. Ishihara color plates showed a marked, acquired color vision defect O.D., O.S. Biomicroscopy revealed amiodarone corneal deposits. The optic nerve appeared healthy, with no visible swelling in each eye. Amiodarone was discontinued after discussion with the cardiologist. On followup, the patient reported disappearance of symptoms. Visual acuity had improved to 20/30(+2) O.D. and 20/30 O.S. Ishihara color plates showed normal color vision.
As the elderly population and the incidence of heart disease increase in the United States, more people will probably be using heart drug therapy. Our case presents some of the challenges involved with managing ocular toxicity of these cardiac drugs. While both amiodarone and digoxin can cause permanent visual changes, the ocular effects are often reversible. Therefore, ocular examination at baseline and every 6 months is indicated for patients receiving a regimen of amiodarone and/or digoxin therapy.
Glyburide is the most widely used sulfonylurea but has unique pharmacodynamic properties that may increase harm. We hypothesized that glyburide causes more hypoglycemia and cardiovascular events than other secretagogues or insulin.
Data sources were Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and three other web-based clinical trial registers (1966-2005). Parallel, randomized, controlled trials in people with type 2 diabetes comparing glyburide monotherapy with monotherapy using secretagogues or insulin were selected. Outcomes were hypoglycemia, glycemic control, cardiovascular events, body weight, and death. Titles and abstracts of 1,806 publications were reviewed in duplicate and 21 relevant articles identified. Data on patient characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and validity were extracted in duplicate using predefined criteria.
Glyburide was associated with a 52% greater risk of experiencing at least one episode of hypoglycemia compared with other secretagogues (relative risk 1.52 [95% CI 1.21-1.92]) and with 83% greater risk compared with other sulfonylureas (1.83 [1.35-2.49]). Glyburide was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (0.84 [0.56-1.26]), death (0.87 [0.70-1.07]), or end-of-trial weight (weighted mean difference 1.69 kg [95% CI -0.41 to 3.80]) compared with other secretagogues. Limitations included suboptimal reporting of original trials. Loss to follow-up exceeded 20% in some studies, and major hypoglycemia was infrequently reported.
Glyburide caused more hypoglycemia than other secretagogues and other sulfonylureas. Glyburide was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, death, or weight gain.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs as a result of accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER and is involved in the mechanisms of various diseases, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The goal of the present study was to clarify the relationship between ER stress and pathological neovascularization in the retina. Proliferation and migration of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC) were assessed in the presence of ER stress inducers, such as tunicamycin and thapsigargin. The expression of ER chaperone immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP), known as Grp78, was evaluated by real time RT-PCR, immunostaining, and Western blotting. Tunicamycin or thapsigargin was injected into the intravitreal body of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model mice at postnatal day 14 (P14) and retinal neovascularization was quantified at P17. The expression and localization of BiP in the retina was also evaluated in the OIR model. Exposure to tunicamycin and thapsigargin increased the proliferation and migration of HRMEC. Tunicamycin enhanced the expression of BiP in HRMEC at both the mRNA level and at the protein level on the cell surface, and increased the formation of a BiP/T-cadherin immunocomplex. In OIR model mice, retinal neovascularization was accelerated by treatments with ER stress inducers. BiP was particularly observed in the pathological vasculature and retinal microvascular endothelial cells, and the increase of BiP expression was correlated with retinal neovascularization. In conclusion, ER stress may contribute to the formation of abnormal vasculature in the retina via BiP complexation with T-cadherin, which then promotes endothelial cell proliferation and migration.
Intravenous (IV) prochlorperazine with diphenhydramine is superior to subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, after providing written informed consent, patients presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of migraine received a 500-mL bolus of IV saline solution and either 10 mg prochlorperazine with 12.5 mg diphenhydramine IV plus saline solution placebo subcutaneously or saline solution placebo IV plus 6 mg sumatriptan subcutaneously. Pain intensity was assessed with 100-mm visual analog scales (visual analog scale at baseline and every 20 minutes for 80 minutes). The primary outcome was change in pain intensity from baseline to 80 minutes or time of ED discharge if subjects remained in the ED for fewer than 80 minutes after treatment. Sedation and nausea were assessed every 20 minutes with visual analog scale scales, and subjects were contacted within 72 hours to assess headache recurrence.
Sixty-eight subjects entered the trial, with complete data for 66 subjects. Baseline pain scores were similar for the prochlorperazine/diphenhydramine and sumatriptan groups (76 versus 71 mm). Mean reductions in pain intensity at 80 minutes or time of ED discharge were 73 mm for the prochlorperazine/diphenhydramine group and 50 mm for those receiving sumatriptan (mean difference 23 mm; 95% confidence interval 11 to 36 mm). Sedation, nausea, and headache recurrence rates were similar.
IV prochlorperazine with diphenhydramine is superior to subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine.
We report a patient who developed paroxysmal kinesigenic dystonia shortly after initiation of therapy with methylphenidate for presumed attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Attacks persisted long after methylphenidate was discontinued and responded completely to treatment with carbamazepine. Though it is possible that methylphenidate caused this syndrome in our patient, it is more likely that the stimulant triggered the onset of a genetically determined disorder.
We investigated the involvement of the protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt) signaling pathway in the mechanical hypersensitivity induced in rats by capsaicin. Intradermal injection of capsaicin results in activation of PKB/Akt in the lumbar spinal cord, most prominently in the dorsal horn, starting by 5 min after capsaicin injection and lasting at least 1h. The activated PKB/Akt in the spinal cord is in neurons, since phospho-PKB/Akt (p-PKB/Akt) colocalizes with the neuronal marker, neuronal-specific nuclear protein (NeuN). The mechanical hypersensitivity is shown by the enhanced paw withdrawal frequency to applications of von Frey filaments with different bending forces (30, 100, 200 mN) on the rat paw. Pre-treatment with several different PKB/Akt inhibitors, including SH-6, Akt inhibitor IV, and Akt inhibitor V, blocked the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin, a measure of spinal cord central sensitization. Two structurally unrelated phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K, upstream of PKB/Akt) inhibitors, Wortmannin and LY294002, also prevented the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin. Furthermore, post-treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, Wortmannin, or PKB/Akt inhibitors, such as NL-71-101, SH-6, Akt inhibitor IV, and inhibitor V significantly reduced the established mechanical hypersensitivity induced by capsaicin. The PKB/Akt signaling pathway in the spinal cord is therefore involved in pain hypersensitivity.
This study examined midazolam and midazolam plus fentanyl in a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. It tested the hypothesis that combined drug therapy results in significantly poorer safety but no difference in efficacy compared to the single drug approach. Subjects were among 207 mildly anxious young adults having their third molars removed. Fentanyl had a significant depressant effect on respiration. Fifty of 79 (63%) subjects who received a midazolam-fentanyl combination became apneic, while only two of 78 (3%) who received midazolam alone were apneic (Fisher's Exact Test, P < 0.001). Two subjects (2.5%) in the combination group and none in the midazolam alone group had oxygen saturations drop below 90%. About twice as many subjects in the combination group had end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) levels greater than 25% above baseline. While these results are consistent with those for apnea, contingency analyses of the oxygen saturation and EtCO2 results were not statistically significant. Subjects in the combination group were more than four times as likely to have excellent versus good, fair, or poor sedation at a given level of intraoperative pain, and behavioral (movement and verbalization) but not cognitive measures of anxiety were attenuated.
We report a patient with classical features of amiodarone hepatotoxicity who died of progressive liver failure. Throughout the course of his illness, he had epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and persistent mild to moderate elevation of amylase and lipase in his serum and peritoneal fluid. Pancreatitis due to amiodarone has not been reported. We raise the question of whether or not the pancreas is yet another organ subject to amiodarone toxicity and speculate as to possible pathogenesis. We suggest that patients on amiodarone who develop abnormal liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain be evaluated not only for hepatotoxicity, but for pancreatitis as well.
Prolonged lamivudine therapy has been identified as the major risk for the development of resistance in HBV, with rates of 90% after 4 years of treatment. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate showed activity against both wild type and lamivudine resistant HBV in HIV-HBV co-infected patients. In order to compare the efficacy of lamivudine/tenofovir treatment we investigated detailed HBV kinetics in 13 HIV-HBV co-infected patients with either wild type HBV or lamivudine resistant HBV. The viral strains in both patient groups showed a biphasic viral decline pattern. Only in the first phase of viral decay, which reflects the clearance rate of the free virus from plasma, there was a statistically significant response in favor of the wild type group. After the first phase we observed a similar viral decline till 24 weeks of both groups. This is reassuring for many pretreated co-infected patients harbouring mutant viruses.
The effects of oestrogen therapy and of orchidectomy on coronary status, as reflected by exercise ECG-testing before and after one year of treatment, were assessed in a randomized study of patients (N = 100) with prostatic cancer. Oestrogen was given as polyestradiol phosphate 80 mg i.m. per month in combination with 150 micrograms ethinylestradiol p.o. per day. There were no significant inter-group differences in conventional risk factors or in pre-treatment exercise test results. Twelve months after the start of therapy the oestrogen group showed a significantly greater depression of the ST-segment during maximal exercise in leads CH2 (P less than 0.0005) and CH5 (P less than 0.01) compared with the pre-treatment depression. Twenty-five per cent (N = 13) of the patients in the oestrogen group suffered cardiovascular complications during the year of therapy, whereas no such complications were observed in the orchidectomy group. However, even the patients in the oestrogen group who had not suffered cardiovascular complications had significantly greater depressions of the ST-segment during exercise both in lead CH2 (P less than 0.0005) and in CH5 (P less than 0.05). There was no significant change in the ST-segment level in the orchidectomy group twelve months after surgery. In summary, we found evidence of an induction of myocardial ischaemia during treatment with exogenous oestrogens at low dosage in patients with prostatic cancer. This deleterious effect of oestrogen on the coronary status argues against oestrogen therapy, since oestrogen has not been shown to be more beneficial than orchidectomy against prostatic carcinoma.
Several drugs for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis and its symptoms have been investigated since some years ago. These drugs are: steroidal-type immunoregulators, immunotherapy and antihistamines. Because of first generation of the last ones originated several side effects, pharmacological research was oriented to the search of formulas with the same of higher efficacy, but with fewer effects on central nervous system.
To compare the efficacy and safety of epinastine 10 mg plus pseudoephedrine 120 mg vs loratadine 5 mg plus pseudoephedrine 120 mg, twice a day, in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis.
A comparative, random, open, prospective, longitudinal and multicenter study was made in 62 patients with an average age of 26.17 +/- 9.75 years (13-56 years) with diagnosis of perennial allergic rhinitis, who attended to external consultation of the different departments of allergy of the participant institutions. All patients were submitted to: complete clinical history, physical exploration, measurement of vital signs, nasal exploration, qualification of allergic symptoms and record of daily symptoms. Moreover, washout during a week and pharmacological treatment was given during two weeks. Symptoms referred by patient and findings of physical exploration during the different visits, as well as rhinoscopic findings, were assessed by a scale of five parameters of rhinitis. Tolerance grade of drugs was assessed based on frequency and severity of side effects.
According to the basal clinical assessment symptoms qualification of patients of groups of epinastine and loratadine was of 9.12 +/- 2.78 and 7.90 +/- 2.7, respectively. Seven side effects appeared: three cases of somnolence, one of sickness and one of anxiety in patients of group of loratadine and one case of somnolence and one of dysmenorrhea in the subjects of group of epinestine. Although it did not have statistically significant difference, it is clinically important for patients. Frequency of side effects was higher in the loratadine group.
Both drugs are efficient for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis.
In this study, we sought to determine the effect of intrathecal (IT) pentazocine or buprenorphine on the neurological outcome after a short interval of spinal cord ischemia in rats. Although IT morphine (30 microg) induced spastic paraparesis after 6 min of aortic occlusion, neither pentazocine (150 microg) nor buprenorphine (4 microg) produced neurological dysfunction. Our results indicate that the effect of various opioids on the motor function after a noninjurious interval of spinal cord ischemia is opioid-specific.
Infantile spasms are characterized by age-specific expression of epileptic spasms and hypsarrhythmia and often result in significant cognitive impairment. Other epilepsies or autism often ensue especially in symptomatic IS (SIS). Cortical or subcortical damage, including white matter, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SIS. To generate a model of SIS, we recreated this pathology by injecting rats with lipopolysaccharide and doxorubicin intracerebrally at postnatal day (P) 3 and with p-chlorophenylalanine intraperitoneally at P5. Spasms occurred between P4 and 13 and were associated with ictal EEG correlates, interictal EEG abnormalities and neurodevelopmental decline. After P9 other seizures, deficits in learning and memory, and autistic-like behaviors (indifference to other rats, increased grooming) were observed. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) did not affect spasms. Vigabatrin transiently suppressed spasms at P5. This new model of SIS will be useful to study the neurobiology and treatment of SIS, including those that are refractory to ACTH.
The symptom of "diminished interest or pleasure" in rewarding stimuli is an affective symptom of nicotine and amphetamine withdrawal, and a core symptom of depression. An operational measure of this symptom is elevation of brain reward thresholds during drug withdrawal. We report here that acute co-administration of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and p-MPPI, a serotonin-1A receptor antagonist, alleviated the diminished interest in brain stimulation reward observed during withdrawal from nicotine or amphetamine in rats (i.e., increased reward). By contrast, the same drug combination treatment did not reduce the somatic signs of nicotine withdrawal indicating symptom-specific neurobiological abnormalities. Surprisingly, the same treatment had opposite effects in control rats where reductions in reward were produced, suggesting that animal models should be based primarily on studying specific deficits that are pathognomic of a psychiatric disorder. The reversal of the affective aspects of drug withdrawal by a treatment that enhances serotonin neurotransmission indicates that decreased serotonergic function may mediate the reward decrements characterizing nicotine and amphetamine withdrawal, and that these symptoms may be homologous to a core symptom of non-drug-induced depressions.
During hippocampal development, the Cornus Ammonis (CA) and the dentate gyrus (DG) undergo waves of neurogenesis and neuronal migration and maturation independently. This stage is widely known to be vulnerable to environmental stresses, but its underlying mechanism is unclear. Alcohol exposure has been shown to alter the expression of genes that regulate the fate, survival, migration and differentiation of pyramidal and granule cells. Undermining this process might compromise hippocampal development underlying the learning and memory deficits known in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). We have previously demonstrated that DNA methylation was programmed along with neural tube development. Here, we demonstrated that DNA methylation program (DMP) proceeded along with hippocampal neuronal differentiation and maturation, and how this DMP was affected by fetal alcohol exposure. C57BL/6 mice were treated with 4% v/v ethanol through a liquid diet along with pair-fed and chow-fed controls from gestation day (E) 7 to E16. We found that a characteristic DMP, including 5-methylcytidine (5mC), 5-hydroxylmethylcytidine (5hmC) and their binding proteins, led the hippocampal neuronal differentiation and maturation spatiotemporally as indicated by their phenotypic marks in the CA and DG pre- and post-natally. Alcohol hindered the acquisition and progression of methylation marks, and altered the chromatin translocation of these marks in the nucleus, which was correlated with developmental retardation.
Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients treated with peg-interferon alpha and ribavirin (peg-IFNalpha/RBV) complain of irritability, attention and memory disturbances which may indicate cognitive impairment associated with treatment.
Assessment of the probable connection between peg-IFNalpha/RBV treatment and the development of cognitive disturbances in CHC patients.
47 CHC patients were divided into two groups: experimental (n=26) and control (n=21). The experimental group patients were given peg-IFNalpha2a (n=18) or peg-IFNalpha2b (n=8) plus RBV in standard doses as recommended by the manufacturers. Control group patients did not receive the above treatment. Both groups underwent a neuropsychological examination consisting of R. Brickenkamp d2 test, Auditory Verbal Learning Test and Hooper Visual Organization Test at the beginning (t=0) and after 12 weeks of treatment or observation (t=1).
The experimental group patients showed significant deterioration in all the measured cognitive functions in t=1 comparing to t=0. Cognitive decline was not seen in the control group. The observed cognitive performance changes could not be correlated sufficiently enough with the presence of organic affective disorders diagnosed according to ICD-10 criteria.
The findings suggest that peg-IFNalpha/RBV therapy of CHC patients is connected with the deterioration in cognitive functioning including attention, auditory verbal memory and visuo-spatial skills. These changes may be the effect of peg-IFNalpha-induced neurotransmission abnormalities in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and parieto-orbital cortical regions and can impair patients' ability to drive a motor vehicle, operate machinery, or their engagement in hazardous activities requiring attention and coordination. Medical professionals should thoroughly inform patients about the possibility of cognitive decline associated with peg-IFNalpha/RBV therapy.
The increases that occur in plasma prolactin (PRL) levels after i.m. administration of 5 mg of haloperidol (the HAL test) provide information about the responsivity of D2 dopamine receptors in the hypothalamus-hypophysis, and may be a measure of their occupancy during the neuroleptic treatment of schizophrenic patients. We studied these responses during treatment with haloperidol (doses 7.5-60 mg daily, mean = 20.6) in 12 male schizophrenic patients who did not have a satisfactory therapeutic response to the drug, and the test was repeated 6 weeks later, after the patients were switched to therapy with the atypical neuroleptic risperidone (8-16 mg daily, mean = 11.7). After the institution of risperidone treatment, the total score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) fell by 38% (from a mean score of 47.2 to 29.3). BPRS subscale scores for positive, negative, and general symptoms were reduced by 38, 35, and 40%, respectively. Moderate PRL responses to the HAL test were found during haloperidol treatment and no responses at all during treatment with risperidone. Baseline PRL increased significantly from a mean of 35.0 (S.D. = 16.0) to a mean of 55.7 ng/ml plasma (S.D. = 19.6). This high potency of risperidone to increase PRL levels cannot be explained by the serotonergic blocking activity of the drug, and seems not to be restricted to its D2 receptor blocking capacity.
We have reported the streptozotocin (SZ)-induced hepatic lesions in the subacute phase (4 to 12 weeks after the treatment), which are characterized by appearance of oncocytic hepatocytes, cytomegalic hepatocytes and bile duct hyperplasia. In this study, we focused on the acute phase (6 to 48 hours after the treatment) of the SZ-induced hepatic lesions of mice to clarify the onset of the hepatic alterations, especially before the induction of hyperglycemia. Livers were taken from 8-week-old Crj:CD-1 (ICR) male mice at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after the 200 mg/kg b.w. of SZ-injection. SZ-induced hyperglycemia was noted at 36 and 48 hours after the treatment, but the hepatic changes including lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial swelling, peroxisome proliferation and inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation occurred before the elevation of the serum glucose levels. The present findings indicate the direct effects of SZ on hepatocytes rather than the secondary effects of diabetes, and certain correlations between the hepatocytic changes in the acute phase and those in the subacute one. In addition, ulcer and submucosal edema of the gallbladder were observed at 36 or 48 hours after the SZ-treatment, which can be a novel finding in SZ-treated animal.
Thirteen adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were given once-monthly injections of haloperidol decanoate (5-15 mg/kg i.m.) for one year. Thereafter, drug-free and treatment periods alternated at 3-month intervals. After 2.5 to 14 months, 12 monkeys showed symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD), such as periocular and perioral twitchings, tongue protrusions, masticatory movements, and choreic movements in arms and legs. When TD symptoms were evident, the periodic treatment was interrupted and symptoms persisted for at least 5 months after the last haloperidol dose, worsened by injection of the anticholinergic drug biperiden. An injection of nondepot haloperidol (0.12 or 0.25 mg/kg) produced a reduction of TD symptoms. At the end of the study, nondepot haloperidol was injected once a week at two doses (0.12 and 0.25 mg/kg i.m.). A syndrome of excitation with peculiar behavior, interpreted as acute dystonia, was precipitated in all animals. The animals showed sustained retrocollis, climbing upside down, biting the perch, repetitive turnings, and frequent backward movements. The dystonic movements lasted approximately 6 hours and were reduced but not completely extinguished by biperiden (0.1 mg/kg). The TD syndrome registered in marmosets may provide a useful model for screening new antipsychotics for their propensity to induce TD.
Rats expressing a transgenic polycystic kidney disease (PKD) gene develop photoreceptor degeneration and subsequent vasoregression, as well as activation of retinal microglia and macroglia. To target the whole neuroglialvascular unit, neuro- and vasoprotective Erythropoietin (EPO) was intraperitoneally injected into four-week old male heterozygous PKD rats three times a week at a dose of 256 IU/kg body weight. For comparison EPO-like peptide, lacking unwanted side effects of EPO treatment, was given five times a week at a dose of 10 µg/kg body weight. Matched EPO treated Sprague Dawley and water-injected PKD rats were held as controls. After four weeks of treatment the animals were sacrificed and analysis of the neurovascular morphology, glial cell activity and pAkt localization was performed. The number of endothelial cells and pericytes did not change after treatment with EPO or EPO-like peptide. There was a nonsignificant reduction of migrating pericytes by 23% and 49%, respectively. Formation of acellular capillaries was significantly reduced by 49% (p<0.001) or 40% (p<0.05). EPO-treatment protected against thinning of the central retina by 10% (p<0.05), a composite of an increase of the outer nuclear layer by 12% (p<0.01) and in the outer segments of photoreceptors by 26% (p<0.001). Quantification of cell nuclei revealed no difference. Microglial activity, shown by gene expression of CD74, decreased by 67% (p<0.01) after EPO and 36% (n.s.) after EPO-like peptide treatment. In conclusion, EPO safeguards the neuroglialvascular unit in a model of retinal neurodegeneration and secondary vasoregression. This finding strengthens EPO in its protective capability for the whole neuroglialvascular unit.
Liver failure is a rare but devastating result of drug toxicity.
To describe three cases of subfulminant liver failure that were probably caused by nefazodone, a new antidepressant that is a synthetically derived phenylpiperazine.
Case series.
Two university medical centers and a children's hospital.
Three women 16 to 57 years of age.
Two patients underwent liver transplantation; the third was listed for transplantation but subsequently improved.
Liver biopsy.
Nefazodone was administered for 14 to 28 weeks before the onset of symptoms. The duration of jaundice before onset of encephalopathy ranged from 4 to 6 weeks. All cases of liver failure had similar histologic appearance, with prominent necrosis in the centrolobular areas (zone 3). One patient had successful liver transplantation, one underwent transplantation but died, and one improved without transplantation. The temporal onset of disease after the start of nefazodone therapy suggested severe hepatocellular injury caused by the drug.
Because nefazodone seems to cause severe hepatocellular injury in an idiosyncratic manner, routine liver chemistries should be performed before starting nefazodone therapy and patients should be monitored regularly. Therapy should be discontinued if liver enzyme concentrations become abnormal.
Rifampicin has been prescribed throughout the world for over 20 years, yet only four cases of rifampicin-induced lupus erythematosus (LE) have been reported. Rifampicin-induced LE is associated with combination therapy with clarithromycin or ciprofloxacin. These drugs are all metabolized through the cytochrome P450 liver enzyme system and combined usage may lead to higher rifampicin blood levels. Drug-induced LE differs from systemic LE; cutaneous manifestations, although uncommon, are an important clue to the diagnosis. We report a case of rifampicin-induced LE presenting with florid cutaneous features.
