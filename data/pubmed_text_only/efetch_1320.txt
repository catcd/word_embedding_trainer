Four cases are reported where patients reacted with severe restlessness, violence or hallucinations at low doses of doxapram infusion. A possible association with hepatic dysfunction is discussed. These reactions persisted long after the cessation of doxapram infusion and the various treatments used are described.
A case of adverse event induced by Iopamidol 300 is reported. Its clinical course and the intensive treatment performed are described.
We retrospectively analysed toxicities and clinical results of 61 Hodgkin's lymphoma patients treated with chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine and etoposide (ChlVPP/ABVVP), delivered in a weekly alternate schedule. Of 61 patients, 33 were in stages III-IV, 21 in stage IIB and seven in stage IIA with bulky disease or extranodal presentation. ChlVPP/ABVVP was administered for 6-8 cycles. Involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) (30-35 Gy) was delivered to 31 patients with residual disease after chemotherapy or bulky disease at diagnosis. Of 61 patients, 58 (95%) achieved complete clinical or radiological remission after chemotherapy and IFRT. With a median follow-up of 60 months, 5-year overall survival, relapse- and event-free survival were 78.8% (95% CI 68.2-91.1%), 81% (95% CI 70.6-92.2%) and 71.9% (95% CI 68.2-82.2%) respectively. Grades 3-4 neutropenia was the most relevant haematological toxicity and occurred in 82% of patients. Non-haematological toxicities were mild and reversible. No toxic deaths were recorded. One patient developed secondary acute myeloid leukaemia 1 year after ChlVPP/ABVVP. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, no definitive conclusions could be drawn about the clinical activity of ChlVPP/ABVVP. Nonetheless, clinical results seem better than those reported with standard regimens [ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, dacarbazine), MOPP (methotrexate, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone), MOPP/ABVD] and as good as those reported using standard or escalated BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone), with a lower degree of haematological and non-haematological toxicity. Long-term results of the ongoing randomized trial, comparing ABVD versus high-dose intensity weekly regimens will be useful to confirm our results.
In this case study, lithium carbonate, used to control bipolar disorders, is postulated to be the cause of downbeat nystagmus; the degree of nystagmus could be correlated with the dosage and serum level of the drug. All tests for anatomic lesion were negative, including metrizamide cisternography.
Learning and memory processes can be affected by morphine administration. It has been previously demonstrated that the effects of morphine depend on the timing of drug administration. In the present study, the effects of microinjections of a NMDA receptor agonist and antagonist into the CA1 regions of the dorsal hippocampi (intra-CA1) on repeated pretreatment of morphine-induced prevention of morphine-induced amnesia have been investigated.
Step-through inhibitory avoidance task of memory has been used to examine retrieval of memory formation, 24 h after training in male Wistar rats.
The results indicate that post-training administration of morphine (7.5 mg/kg) impaired memory retrieval, but not in the animals, which received previous repeated morphine (7.5 and 10 mg/kg) injections followed by morphine withdrawal. Repeated co-administration of NMDA (7.5 and 10 ng/rat, intra-CA1) with an ineffective dose of morphine (5 mg/kg), once daily for three days reversed morphine-induced amnesia. Repeated bilateral intra-CA1 microinjections of NMDA, once daily for three days followed by a five-day washout had no effect on the expression of amnesia produced by post-training morphine. Three-day administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist, D-AP5 (0.5 - 2 µg/rat, intra-CA1) followed by a five-day washout had no effect on morphine-induced amnesia. On the other hand, intra-CA1 microinjections of the same doses of D-AP5 prior to injection of 7.5 mg/kg of morphine (per day×3 days) decreased the reversal of morphine-induced amnesia.
These data imply that the dorsal hippocampal NMDA receptor mechanism(s) may modulate the effect-induced by repeated morphine administration on a challenge dose of morphine-induced amnesia.
A 4-year-old girl who developed convulsions after an accidental ingestion of excessive dosage (50 mg/kg) of nalidixic acid, while treated with the drug (50 mg/kg/day) over 30 days for a urinary tract infection, was reported. Thirty minutes after ingestion, vomiting, tonic-clonic seizures, and abnormal movements were supervened. After ninety minutes, the serum levels of nalidixic acid and hydroxynalidixic acid were 146.1 and 48.9 microgram/ml, respectively. In controls, the mean levels of nalidixic acid and hydroxynalidixic acid were 7.8 +/- 6.8 (SD) and 3.02 +/- 2.6 microgram/ml, respectively.
Progesterone (PROG) provides neuroprotection to the injured central and peripheral nervous system. These effects may be due to regulation of myelin synthesis in glial cells and also to direct actions on neuronal function. Both types of cells express classical intracellular PROG receptors (PR), while neurons additionally express the PROG membrane-binding site called 25-Dx. In motoneurons from rats with spinal cord injury (SCI), PROG restores to normal the deficient levels of choline acetyl-transferase and of alpha3 subunit Na,K-ATPase mRNA, while levels of the growth associated protein GAP-43 mRNA are further stimulated. Recent studies suggest that neurotrophins are possible mediators of hormone action, and in agreement with this assumption, PROG treatment of rats with SCI increases the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at both the mRNA and protein levels in ventral horn motoneurons. In situ hybridization (ISH) has shown that SCI reduces BDNF mRNA levels by 50% in spinal motoneurons, while PROG administration to injured rats (4mg/kg/day during 3 days, s.c.) elicits a three-fold increase in grain density. In addition to enhancement of mRNA levels, PROG increases BDNF immunoreactivity in perikaryon and cell processes of motoneurons of the lesioned spinal cord, and also prevents the lesion-induced chromatolytic degeneration of spinal cord motoneurons as determined by Nissl staining. Our findings strongly indicate that motoneurons of the spinal cord are targets of PROG, as confirmed by the expression of PR and the regulation of molecular parameters. PROG enhancement of endogenous neuronal BDNF could provide a trophic environment within the lesioned spinal cord and might be part of the PROG activated-pathways to provide neuroprotection. Thus, PROG treatment constitutes a new approach to sustain neuronal function after injury.
Sixty depressed outpatients were allocated to treatment with either amitriptyline (75-225 mg/day) or flupenthixol (1-5-4-5 mg/day) in flexible dosage for six weeks under double-blind procedures. Various objective and subjective assessments were carried out before and after one, three, and six weeks of treatment. Twenty-three patients completed the course of amitriptyline and 28 the course of flupenthixol. Almost all variables improved significantly over time, irrespective of drug. On most ratings there were no significant differences between the two drugs, but the trends favoured flupenthixol. In particular, flupenthixol lessened anxiety scores more than amitriptyline. Unwanted effects were few and not troublesome except in two patients receiving amitriptyline. Flupenthixol, in low dosage, is a useful alternative antidepressant for depressed outpatients.
Manganese (Mn) and lead (Pb) exposures during developmental period can impair development by direct neurotoxicity or through interaction with iron metabolism. Therefore, we examined the effects of maternal ingestion of Mn or Pb in drinking water during gestation and lactation on iron metabolism as well as behavior in their offspring. Pregnant dams were given distilled water, 4.79mg/ml Mn, or 2.84mg/ml Pb in drinking water during gestation and lactation. Pups were studied at time of weaning for (59)Fe absorption from the gut, duodenal divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) expression, hematological parameters, and anxiety-related behavior using an Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test. Metal-exposed pups had lower body weights and elevated blood and brain concentrations of the respective metal. Pb-exposed pups had lower hematocrits and higher blood Zn protoporphyrin levels. In contrast, Mn exposed pups had normal hematological parameters but significantly reduced Zn protoporphyrin. Pharmacokinetic studies using (59)Fe showed that intestinal absorption in metal-exposed pups was not different from controls, nor was it correlated with duodenal DMT1 expression. However, intravenously injected (59)Fe was cleared more slowly in Pb-exposed pups resulting in higher plasma levels. The overall tissue uptake of (59)Fe was lower in Mn-exposed and lower in the brain in Pb-exposed pups. The EPM test demonstrated that Mn-exposed, but not Pb-exposed, pups had lower anxiety-related behavior compared to controls. We conclude that gestational and lactational exposures to Mn or Pb differentially alter Fe metabolism and anxiety-related behavior. The data suggest that perturbation in Fe metabolism may contribute to the pathophysiologic consequences of Mn and Pb exposure during early development.
Administration of vecuronium by infusion is an increasingly common technique, both in the operating room and in the intensive care unit (ICU), for patients requiring prolonged neuromuscular blockade and mechanical ventilation. The major advantage of vecuronium over older neuromuscular blocking agents is its rapid excretion and intermediate duration of action. Prior to the current case report, the longest reported continuous paralysis after the cessation of a vecuronium infusion was 90 hours. A case of an 81-year-old patient with renal failure and subclinical chronic cirrhosis of the liver, who remained paralyzed for 13 days following a vecuronium infusion, is described. Intensive monitoring of neuromuscular function is recommended whenever muscle relaxants are administered by continuous infusion.
A series of compounds related to the left-hand domain of the azinomycins have been made and evaluated for cytotoxic activity against a small panel of human tumour cell lines. The epoxide ring is shown to be essential for biological activity. Cytotoxicity is also shown to be sensitive to changes in the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring and the amide group.
Sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity, but only few studies were conducted in Asian countries. Previous studies suggest that SO(2) may have adverse health effects independent of other pollutants. In the Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA) project, the short-term associations between ambient sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) and daily mortality were examined in Bangkok, Thailand, and three Chinese cities: Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Wuhan. Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions were used to adjust for seasonality and other time-varying covariates. Effect estimates were obtained for each city and then for the cities combined. The impact of alternative model specifications, such as lag structure of pollutants and degree of freedom (df) for time trend, on the estimated effects of SO(2) were also examined. In both individual-city and combined analysis, significant effects of SO(2) on total non-accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality were observed. An increase of 10 microg/m(3) of 2-day moving average concentrations of SO(2) corresponded to 1.00% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-1.24], 1.09% (95% CI, 0.71-1.47), and 1.47% (95% CI, 0.85-2.08) increase of total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively, in the combined analysis. Sensitivity analyzes suggested that these findings were generally insensitive to alternative model specifications. After adjustment for PM(10) or O(3), the effect of SO(2) remained significant in three Chinese cities. However, adjustment for NO(2) diminished the associations and rendered them statistically insignificant in all four cities. In conclusion, ambient SO(2) concentration was associated with daily mortality in these four Asian cities. These associations may be attributable to SO(2) serving as a surrogate of other substances. Our findings suggest that the role of outdoor exposure to SO(2) should be investigated further in this region.
A 69-year-old lady with RA developed porphyria cutanea tarda 2 weeks following initiation of methotrexate therapy. The clinical and laboratory features are described.
Propofol has a high incidence of pain on injection, particularly when a vein on the back of hand is used. Administration of lidocaine, either before or mixed with propofol remains the most widely used method to attenuate this pain. The use of opioids such as alfentanil and fentanyl has been found to decrease pain induced by propofol injection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different doses of remifentanil and alfentanil in minimizing the pain caused by propofol.
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy premedicated children between the age group of 5-12 years admitted for adenotonsillectomy were randomly allocated to one of 6 treatment groups. Group I: remifentanil 0.25 microg kg(-1); Group II: remifentanil 0.50 microg kg(-1); Group III: alfentanil 15 microg kg(-1); Group IV: alfentanil 20 microg kg(-1) 60 s prior to propofol mixed with 1 mL of 0.9% normal saline; Group V: lidocaine 1 mL of 1% (10 mg) added to 100 mg of propofol and Group VI: normal saline. During the injection of propofol (3 mg kg(-1)) pain perception was assessed with a four-point behavioural scale: none, mild, moderate, or severe.
There were 52 subjects in Group I, 51 in Group II, 49 in Group III, 52 in Group IV, 52 in Group V and 52 in Group VI; 63.46% of patients in Group I, 39.21% in Group II, 38.77% in Group III, 36.53% in Group IV, 38.46% in Group V and 84.61% in Group VI experienced pain. Statistically, Groups II, III, IV and V were significantly better than placebo in the reduction of propofol pain (P<0.0001). Groups II, III and IV significantly reduced the pain in comparison with Group I (P<0.001).
Pretreatment with intravenous remifentanil 0.5 microg kg(-1), alfentanil 15 microg kg(-1) and 20 microg kg(-1) were equally effective in reducing pain associated with propofol injection in children between the age group of 5-12 years.
Dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, the most severe responses to dengue virus (DV) infection, are characterized by plasma leakage (due to increased vascular permeability) and low platelet counts. CLEC5A (C-type lectin domain family 5, member A; also known as myeloid DAP12-associating lectin (MDL-1)) contains a C-type lectin-like fold similar to the natural-killer T-cell C-type lectin domains and associates with a 12-kDa DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) on myeloid cells. Here we show that CLEC5A interacts with the dengue virion directly and thereby brings about DAP12 phosphorylation. The CLEC5A-DV interaction does not result in viral entry but stimulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Blockade of CLEC5A-DV interaction suppresses the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines without affecting the release of interferon-alpha, supporting the notion that CLEC5A acts as a signalling receptor for proinflammatory cytokine release. Moreover, anti-CLEC5A monoclonal antibodies inhibit DV-induced plasma leakage, as well as subcutaneous and vital-organ haemorrhaging, and reduce the mortality of DV infection by about 50% in STAT1-deficient mice. Our observation that blockade of CLEC5A-mediated signalling attenuates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages infected with DV (either alone or complexed with an enhancing antibody) offers a promising strategy for alleviating tissue damage and increasing the survival of patients suffering from dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, and possibly even other virus-induced inflammatory diseases.
To clarify the relationship between arginine metabolism and hepatic injury, metabolomic analysis was performed in rats treated with 3 representative hepatotoxicants, monocrotaline (MCT), concanavalin A (ConA), and α-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT); or a myotoxicant, tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD). A single dose of MCT, ConA, or ANIT dose-dependently induced hepatocellular necrosis accompanied by decreased blood arginine and increased blood alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and arginase. A close correlation was detected between arginine and ALT (r = -0.746, -0.795, -0.787 for MCT, ConA, ANIT, respectively) or between arginine and arginase (r = -0.605, -0.808, -0.672 for MCT, ConA, ANIT, respectively) in all three hepatic injury models. In contrast, neither hepatocellular necrosis nor alterations in arginine were found in the skeletal muscle injury model, although ALT was slightly increased. An in vitro assay revealed that blood samples obtained from ConA-treated rats transformed external arginine to ornithine, and the reaction was totally inhibited by an arginase inhibitor. These results suggest that blood arginase plays a crucial role in arginine metabolism associated with hepatic injury. In metabolomic analysis, nearly 450 endogenous metabolites were identified in blood obtained from all the models. Among the 13 metabolites involved in arginine metabolism, decreased arginine and increased ornithine occurred in common in the hepatic injury models, whereas citrulline and other metabolites were not altered. These results indicate that arginine metabolism, especially the arginine-to-ornithine pathway, is altered in association with acute hepatic injury. Furthermore, blood arginine and ornithine are possibly specific biomarkers for hepatic injury.
A 3 1/2-year-old child developed myoclonic seizures following a chlorambucil overdose. Serial electroencephalograms showed paroxysmal discharges that continued several days beyond clinical seizure activity. The use of the electroencephalogram when chlorambucil toxicity is suspected is discussed.
1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-pentanone (α-PVP) is a new designer drug of the cathinone type. People who have taken drugs containing α-PVP or other synthetic cathinone reportedly lose consciousness, develop difficulty breathing, and at worst case, die. However, the mechanism underlying α-PVP-induced neurotoxicity is unknown. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of α-PVP on the central nervous system (CNS) and compare its neurotoxicity with that of methamphetamine (METH) in mice. Balb/c male mice (8 weeks old) were orally administered α-PVP (25 mg/kg) or METH (5 mg/kg). α-PVP induced a significant increase in locomotor activity, which occurred earlier than locomotor activity induced by METH. This increase was inhibited by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH23990 (50 µg/kg, i.p.) and the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (50 mg/kg, i.m.). The extracellular concentration of dopamine (DA) in the striatum, determined by in vivo microdialysis increased immediately after α-PVP administration. These results suggest that α-PVP stimulates DA release, causing an increase in locomotor activity, and that this stimulatory effect of α-PVP on CNS is mediated, at least in part, by the D1 and D2 receptors.
Maternal diabetes induces a pro-oxidant/pro-inflammatory intrauterine environment related to the induction of congenital anomalies. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that regulate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways. We investigated whether maternal diets supplemented with olive oil, enriched in oleic acid, a PPAR agonist, can regulate the expression of PPAR system genes, levels of lipoperoxidation and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) in embryos and decidua from diabetic rats. The embryos and decidua from diabetic rats showed reduced expression of PPARs and increased concentration of lipoperoxidation, MMPs and TIMPs, whereas the maternal treatments enriched in olive oil increased PPARδ in embryos and PPARγ and PPARγ-coactivator-1α expression in decidua, and increased TIMPs concentrations and decreased lipoperoxidation and MMPs activity in both tissues. Thus, maternal diets enriched in olive oil can regulate embryonic and decidual PPAR system genes expression and reduce the pro-oxidant/pro-inflammatory environment during rat early organogenesis.
In this study the human glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) model of migraine was for the first time used to test the effect of a prophylactic drug. We chose to test valproate due to its well documented effect as a migraine prophylactic drug. Efficacy of this compound would support the usefulness of the model in prophylactic antimigraine drug development. Twelve patients with migraine without aura were included in a randomized double blind crossover study. Valproate 1000 mg or placebo was given daily, each for a minimum of 13 days. On the last treatment day of each arm a 20 min intravenous infusion of GTN (0.25 microg/kg/min) was given. Headache was registered for 12 h after the infusion and headache intensity was scored on a scale from 0 to 10. Fulfillment of IHS criteria was recorded for 24 h. The middle cerebral arteries were evaluated by transcranial Doppler and the diameter of the superficial temporal and radial arteries were measured with high frequency ultrasound. GTN evoked migraine fulfilling IHS criteria 1.1 in 6 patients after placebo and in 2 patients after valproate (P = 0.125). Including additionally 3 patients on placebo and 1 patient on valproate who felt they had suffered a migraine attack, but who had as associated symptoms only photophobia or phonophobia, a significant reduction in the number of patients with induced migraine after valproate was seen (P = 0.031). Median peak headache intensity was 1 (range 0-9) after valproate compared to 4.5 (range 0-8) after placebo (P = 0.120). Pretreatment with valproate as compared to placebo reduced the velocity in both middle cerebral arteries after GTN (left P = 0.021, right P = 0.031). No effect of valproate was seen in the diameter of the superficial temporal artery (P = 0.781) or the radial artery (P = 0.367) before or after GTN. The study indicates that a prophylactic effect of valproate may be demonstrated using the GTN human migraine model. Although, all headache parameters were reduced after valproate compared to placebo, only one parameter was statistically significantly reduced probably because of the small number of patients. The size of the effect was similar to that of valproate in clinical trials. The GTN model may therefore be a valid tool for testing new prophylactic antimigraine drugs.
Although levodopa has provided a major advance in the treatment of parkinsonism, its maximum benefits have not yet been realised, in part because of its complicated pharmacokinetics. This review summarises that available pharmacokinetic data involving levodopa, especially as it relates to therapeutic response of parkinsonian patients. A large number of factors, including protein intake, gastric emptying time, pyridoxine ingestion, and dopa decarboxylase activity, affect plasma levels of levodopa attained following oral administration of this drug. Other variables influence the rate of brain uptake of levodopa from the blood. Even so, plasma levodopa concentration correlates significantly with dosage size in a large parkinsonian population and also coincides with therapeutic response in many, but not all, patients. Therefore, in certain instances, valuable information may be derived by correlating clinical response with plasma levodopa concentration. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of homovanillic acid, a major metabolite of dopamine, may have some value in predicting clinical response to levodopa. This relationship, however, has not been firmly established. Concentration of homovanillic acid or levodopa in body fluids may also be closely related to certain adverse side-effects, including abnormal involuntary movements, gastric discomfort and psychiatric disturbances. Evidence indicates that a clearer understanding of levodopa pharmacokinetics may improve the clinical management of parkinsonism.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is upregulated in the diabetic kidney and contributes to renal injury. This study investigates the possible beneficial effects of the ACE inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril and the AT1 receptor blocker (ARB), valsartan, on renal ACE expression, renal structure, and function in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Male Wistar rats were allocated into four groups: control, STZ-diabetic rats, and STZ-diabetic rats treated with either enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) or valsartan (50 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Enalapril and valsartan reduced renal ACE mRNA and protein expression, Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity, oxidative stress, and serum transforming growth factor-β1 levels compared to the diabetic group. Both treatments normalized renal nitrate/nitrite levels and ameliorated the observed histopathological changes. In conclusion, ACE downregulation by ACEI and ARB indicates that angiotensin II upregulates ACE through AT1 receptor. Prevention of diabetes-induced changes in ACE expression and Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity could be a new explanation of the renoprotective effects of ACEIs and ARBs.
A side reaction of antiarrhythmic treatment in a 18-year-old patient with congestive cardiomyopathy is reported. During treatment with high doses of aprindine cerebral convulsions occurred. After ceasing the medication temporarily, a pacemaker revision was done in local anesthesia. Cerebral convulsions reappeared after injection of the local anesthetic. The patient died due to cardiac arrest. It is discussed that some amount of the local anesthetic agent (mepivacaine) was absorbed from the tissue elevating the blood level of local anesthetic drugs (aprindine and mepivacine) into the toxic range, thus producing cerebral convulsions, augmenting the stimulation threshold and depressing the automaticity of the heart. It is urged that antiarrhythmic treatment should be stopped before local anesthesia will be performed.
The effect of various classes of serotonergic agents on haloperidol-induced catalepsy was evaluated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The 5-HT-1A agonists buspirone, ipsapirone and 8-OH-DPAT all potently reversed catalepsy. The mixed 5-HT-1A and 5-HT-1B agonist RU 24969 reversed catalepsy only at the highest dose tested. The non-selective 5-HT-1 antagonist (l)-propranolol did not affect catalepsy. The 5-HT-2 agonist DOI and 5-HT-2 antagonist mesulergine both reversed catalepsy. ICS 205-930 (5-HT-3 antagonist) reversed catalepsy at low doses only. Another 5-HT-3 antagonist, GR 38032F, had no effect on catalepsy. These studies suggest that 5-HT-1A and 5-HT-2 receptor sites are important in the serotonergic modulation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy.
Hydralazine was dissolved in 0.5% drinking saline (40 mg/1000 ml) labelled with isotope 22Na and given to spontaneously hypertensive rats for four weeks. Another group of rats were given isotope labelled saline only and served as control. Measurements of total exchangeable sodium, blood pressure, pulse rate and weight were performed before and repeatedly during treatment. Before treatment exchangeable sodium, blood pressure, pulse rate, and weight were no different between the groups. The antihypertensive effect of hydralazine was marked and maintained throughout the experiment. No significant changes were found in pulse rate. Both groups gained weight similarly. Exchangeable sodium increased at the same rate in both groups along with the weight increase. Thus, chronic hydralazine treatment effectively reduces blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats without causing measurable sodium or fluid retention.
