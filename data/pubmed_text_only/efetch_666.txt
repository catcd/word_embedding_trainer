Modern antituberculous therapy consists of a combination of several drugs, some of which (e.g. rifampicin and streptomycin) may cause impairment of renal function. Pyrazinamide therapy has been associated with dose-dependent hepatotoxicity, hyperuricaemia, arthralgia and arthritis. The patient described in this report developed renal failure, fever, arthritis and arthralgia during administration of isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and pyrazinamide. The renal biopsy showed tubulo-interstitial nephritis. After withdrawal of pyrazinamide, while continuing all other drugs, both renal function and histological findings improved which points to an association of renal failure with pyrazinamide.
Family studies have demonstrated that the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a major genetic etiologic component, but expression and penetrance of the phenotype are variable. Mice with null mutations of Hoxa1 or Hoxb1, two genes critical to hindbrain development, have phenotypic features frequently observed in autism, but no naturally occurring variants of either gene have been identified in mammals.
By sequencing regions of genomic DNA of patients with autism spectrum disorders, we detected a substitution variant at HOXA1 and an insertion variant at HOXB1, both in coding regions of the genes. Fifty-seven individuals ascertained for a diagnosis of an ASD, along with 166 of their relatives, were typed for these variants. Two non-ASD populations were typed, and the frequency of the newly identified alleles was determined in all groups. The genotypes of the ASD families were tested for conformation to Hardy-Weinberg proportions and Mendelian expectations for gene transmission.
The frequency of the variants was 10-25% in persons of European or African origin. In the ASD families, there was a significant deviation from the HOXA1 genotype ratios expected from Hardy-Weinberg proportions (P = 0.005). Among affected offspring, a significant deviation from Mendelian expectation in gene transmission (P = 0.011) was observed. No statistically significant effects were detected when the same analyses were applied to the HOXB1 locus, but there was evidence of an interaction between HOXA1, HOXB1, and gender in susceptibility to ASDs.
The results support a role for HOXA1 in susceptibility to autism, and add to the existing body of evidence implicating early brain stem injury in the etiology of ASDs.
All memory disturbances, especially those developing suddenly, cause anxiety of the patient. Transient global amnesia is a form of amnesia of interest in many aspects. The amnesia was described in 1964 by Fisher and Adams, and as yet about 1000 cases have been reported. Middle aged or elderly patients prevail. The attack of amnesia lasts from several to about 20 hours and begins suddenly being regarded as mental confusion. The amnesia covers recent and remote events in many years. During the attack the patient is not appearing to be ill, but is depressed not knowing what has happened. The awareness of own personality, the ability to solve logical problems and visuospatial functions are preserved. The ability to execute complex activities, e.g. car driving, is normal. The aetiology of the disorder is completely unknown. The hypotheses for explaining the syndrome are: 1. ischaemia in the posterior cerebral arteries region with transient fall of blood supply through the vertebrobasilar system, 2. epilepsy or migraine, 3. disturbed aggregation of platelets in the cerebral vessels leading to loss of vessel patency. The first hypothesis seems least plausible. Attacks of this amnesia were noted after triazolam, after thalamic infarction and cerebral angiography, in brain tumours, hydrocephalus, scleroderma, frontal lobe haemorrhage. After an attack the events occurring in it are not remembered. Recurrence of attacks is very rare. Most authors consider that the disorder is benign and regresses without sequelae or only with slight changes in cognitive functions and memory fixation.
Type II collagen is coded by a large gene (COL2A1) consisting of 54 exons on chromosome 12. During the past few years several cartilage disorders have been linked to this gene, and some specific nucleotide changes have been identified in patients. In a spondyloepiphyseal form of chondrodysplasia, the three mutations found so far are all in exon 48 in the region coding for the carboxyl-terminal end of the triple helix. Since folding of the type II collagen polypeptides to the triple helix is initiated from the carboxyl-terminal end, it has been suggested that mutations in this region typically result in severe cartilage diseases. Here we report a novel mutation located in the area coding for the amino-terminal part of the triple helix in a sporadic patient with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED). The mutation, a substitution of G1063 to A, which results in the conversion of Gly154 to Arg, was identified using exon-specific amplification of genomic DNA and subsequent analyses with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and single-strand conformation polymorphism. The substitution was not found in any other SED patient in Finland. This novel mutation demonstrates that amino acid substitutions in the amino-terminal part of the type II collagen triple helix can also result in SED.
Diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (DEGME) has been selected as a replacement anti-icing additive for ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) in Navy jet aircraft fuel. This experiment was performed to determine whether DEGME produced similar toxicity to EGME following dermal exposure. Male guinea pigs were dermally exposed to 1.00, 0.20, 0.04, or 0 (control) g/kg/day DEGME for 13 weeks, 5 days/week, 6 hr/day. Another group of animals was similarly exposed to 1.00 g/kg/day EGME. Body weights as well as testicular and splenic weights were reduced as a result of exposure to EGME, DEGME-exposed animals exhibited decreased splenic weight in the high- and medium-dose (1.00 and 0.20 g/kg/day) exposure groups only. Hematologic changes in EGME-exposed animals included mild anemia with increased erythrocytic mean corpuscular volumes and a lymphopenia with increased neutrophils. Similar hematological changes were not observed in any animals exposed to DEGME. Serum creatine kinase activity was increased in animals exposed to EGME, and serum lactate dehydrogenase activity was increased in EGME and 1.00 g/kg/day DEGME-exposed animals. In general, DEGME produced minimal toxicological changes following dermal exposure, whereas the toxicological changes observed following similar exposure to EGME were much more profound.
Potential utility of mexiletine for the treatment of sparfloxacin-induced long QT syndrome was assessed using the in vivo halothane-anesthetized canine model. At 30 min after the administration of a supratherapeutic dose of sparfloxacin (30 mg/kg, i.v.), the mean blood pressure and heart rate decreased, whereas repolarization process and effective refractory period of the ventricular muscle were significantly prolonged. Additional administration of a clinically recommended dose of mexiletine (3 mg/kg, i.v.) at this time point increased the mean blood pressure, suppressed ventricular contraction, delayed atrioventricular as well as intraventricular conduction, and shortened repolarization process and effective refractory period. The extent of abbreviation of the repolarization was more prominent than that of the refractoriness, indicating that mexiletine could decrease the electrical vulnerability of the heart during sparfloxacin overdose. Thus, mexiletine may become a promising pharmacological strategy against the drug-induced long QT syndrome.
To report the safety and efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone in the treatment of inflammatory cystoid macular oedema (CMO) in six patients who were resistant to other forms of therapy.
An open-label unmasked prospective nonrandomized pilot study of six patients with idiopathic uveitis and visually significant macular oedema, resistant to periocular and/or systemic corticosteroid treatment, was carried out. Baseline examination and investigations were performed, including fundus fluorescein angiography, and the patients were given a single intravitreal injection of triamcinolone (4 mg/0.1 mL). The primary outcome measure was angiographic resolution of CMO. Patients were reviewed at intervals of 2-4 weeks for 12 months.
A single intravitreal injection of triamcinolone induced clinical and angiographic resolution of inflammatory macular oedema in all patients for varying periods of time up to 6 months. Five patients experienced increased intraocular pressure to 30 mmHg or greater which required treatment. Two patients developed posterior subcapsular cataract.
One injection of intravitreal triamcinolone was an effective short-term treatment for resistant CMO in uveitis. As with steroids given by other routes, raised intraocular pressure and cataract may occur. As it was so effective in these eyes with resistant CMO, a larger study is warranted to evaluate this form of therapy.
An analysis of the efficacy of tacrolimus treatment in three patients with difficult and severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) whose active disease had been previously poorly controlled by cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide.
A review of patient notes.
Two patients are well controlled after six and nine months of treatment with tacrolimus 0.06 mg/kg/day and 0.18 mg/kg/day. Previous persistent vasculitis had resolved and other features of active disease were controlled. The third patient's vasculitis had not improved significantly after two months of treatment and tacrolimus 0.17 mg/kg/day was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity.
Tacrolimus may be a useful additional immunosuppressive agent in some patients whose SLE is not well controlled by conventional treatments.
It has been verified that carvedilol can attenuate myocardial no-reflow. However, the effects of carvedilol on adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are unknown. Forty mini-swines were randomized into 5 study groups: 8 control, 8 carvedilol pretreatment, 8 glibenclamide (K(ATP) channel blocker)-treated, 8 carvedilol and glibenclamide-pre-treated and 8 sham-operated. An acute myocardial infarction(AMI) and reperfusion model was created with a three-hour occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by one-hour reperfusion. Compared with the control group, carvedilol significantly decreased the area of no-reflow (myocardial contrast echocardiography: from 78.5+/-4.5% to 24.9+/-4.1%, pathological means: from 82.3+/-1.9% to 25.8+/-4.3% of ligation area, respectively; all p < 0.01) and reduced necrosis size from 98.5+/-1.3% to 74.4+/-4.7% of ligation area, p < 0.05). It also decreased plasma ET-1 and myocardial tissue ET-1. However, glibenclamide abrogated the protective effect of carvedilol. The beneficial effect of carvedilol on myocardial no-reflow could be due to its effect on ET-1 via the activation of the K(ATP) channel.
Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by water and sodium retention, which leads to edema formation. The nonosmotic stimulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) release from the pituitary gland has been implicated to be one of the important factors of abnormal water retention in patients with nephrotic syndrome. It is not known, however, whether nephrotic syndrome is associated with stimulation of hypothalamic vasopressin gene expression. Puromycin aminonucleoside is known to cause altered glomerular permeability, which results in experimental nephrotic syndrome in rats. In the present study, therefore, AVP gene expression has been studied in the hypothalamus of rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome (PNS). Nephrotic syndrome was induced by a single intravenous injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (50 mg/kg body weight). Nephrotic syndrome was confirmed by urinary protein excretion (control 20.8 +/- 3.5 mg/24 hr v PNS 273.9 +/- 41.4 mg/24 hr; P < 0.0001, n = 6) and serum albumin concentrations (control 4.52 +/- 0.07 g/dL v PNS 2.96 +/- 0.22 g/dL; P < 0.001, n = 6). In PNS rats, plasma AVP was significantly higher than in control rats (control 0.77 +/- 0.10 pg/mL v PNS 2.13 +/- 0.42 pg/mL; P < 0.005, n = 12), even though there were no differences in plasma osmolality (control 292.0 +/- 2.0 mOsm/kg H2O v PNS 290.3 +/- 2.5 mOsm/kg H2O; P = NS, n = 12) or serum sodium concentration (control 142.7 +/- 0.7 v PNS 142.1 +/- 1.1; PNS, n = 12).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used in treating various arthritides have been implicated in decreased renal function. We describe two patients who had acute renal failure that was apparently secondary to fenoprofen and was associated with a tubulointerstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome. The complication resolved when the use of the drug was discontinued.
The semisynthetic plant alkaloid halofuginone (HAL) was reported to prevent and partly reverse experimental liver fibrosis. However, its mechanisms of action are poorly understood. We therefore aimed to determine the antifibrotic potential of HAL and to characterize involved signal transduction pathways in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Results were compared with its in vivo effects in a rat model of reversal of established liver fibrosis induced by thioacetamide. In vitro HAL inhibited HSC proliferation and migration dose dependently at submicromolar concentrations. HAL (200 nm) up-regulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-13 expression between 10- and 50-fold, resulting in a 2- to 3-fold increase of interstitial collagenase activity. Procollagen alpha1(I) and MMP-2 transcript levels were suppressed 2- to 3-fold, whereas expression of other profibrogenic mRNAs remained unaffected. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and nuclear factor kappaB(NFkappaB) pathways were activated by HAL, and specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK and NFkappaB dose dependently inhibited MMP-13 induction. Treatment with HAL did not affect HSC viability, and observed effects were reversible after its removal. In vivo HAL up-regulated MMP-3 and -13 mRNA expression 1.5- and 2-fold, respectively, in cirrhotic rats, whereas tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 was suppressed by 50%. In conclusion, submicromolar concentrations of HAL inhibit HSC proliferation and migration and up-regulate their expression of fibrolytic MMP-3 and -13 via activation of p38 MAPK and NFkappaB. The remarkable induction of MMP-3 and -13 makes HAL a promising agent for antifibrotic combination therapies.
A factorial design method was applied in this multicentre trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril hydrochloride (Accupril) in combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to assess the additive effects of the combination versus monotherapy, to characterise the dose-response relationship of each drug in the presence of the other and to determine if quinapril would attenuate the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ. Following a two to four week placebo-baseline period, 460 qualifying patients with a DBP > or = 100 mmHg and < or = 115 mmHg were randomised to an eight week double-blind phase with one of 16 parallel treatments: placebo, one of three doses of quinapril monotherapy, one of three doses of HCTZ monotherapy or one of nine possible corresponding combinations of quinapril and HCTZ. Mean reductions in sitting SBP/DBP at trough with combination therapy ranged from 7.8 mmHg/7.2 mmHg to 19.6 mmHg/15.1 mmHg (n = 458). Results of the response surface analyses indicate that the effects of the two drugs were additive and that the maximum antihypertensive effect of quinapril in combination with HCTZ within the doses studied is achieved approximately at a dose of 26 mg quinapril and 25 mg HCTZ. The degree of attenuation of the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ was directly related to the dose of quinapril. At 40 mg quinapril, the HCTZ dose-related decreases of serum potassium were not apparent and overall hypokalemic effects were attenuated by quinapril. Thus, the combination of quinapril and HCTZ given once daily provided additive antihypertensive effects of predictable degrees and the addition of quinapril attenuated the hypokalemic effect of HCTZ.
In a clinical phase I/II study, high-dose cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone (HAM) were given in combination to 40 patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia. All patients had received a 9-day combination of thioguanine, Ara-C, and daunorubicin (TAD-9) as standardized first-line treatment. Refractoriness was defined as (a) nonresponse against two TAD-9 induction cycles, (b) early relapse within the first 6 months on monthly maintenance or after TAD-9 consolidation, (c) relapse after 6 months with nonresponse against one additional TAD-9 cycle, and (d) second and subsequent relapses after successful TAD-9 therapy at the preceding relapse. Therapy consisted of HD-Ara-C 3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1 through 4; mitoxantrone was started at 12 mg/m2/day on days 3, 4, and 5 and was escalated to 4 and 5 doses of 10 mg/m2/day on days 2 through 5 and 2 through 6. Of the 40 patients, 21 achieved a complete remission (53%), 1 patient had a partial remission, and 5 patients were nonresponders. Thirteen patients died in aplasia due to infections (n = 11), pericardiac effusion, or acute cardiomyopathy. Nonhematologic side effects consisted predominantly of nausea and vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea. Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms were observed during six treatment courses. Recovery of blood counts occurred at a median of 27 days from the onset of treatment; the median time to complete remission was 36 days. Two of the 21 responders underwent successful bone marrow transplantations. The median remission duration for the remaining 19 patients is 4.5 months, and the median survival time is 9 months. These data emphasize that HAM has high antileukemic activity in refractory AML and strongly suggest starting the combination at earlier stages in AML therapy.
We present a case provoked life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias probably due to psychotropic drugs. The patient was a 55-year-old man who had previously twice operations of aortic valve replacement (AVR). The signs of cardiac failure were recurrently appeared from the end of 1991, and he had received promethazine and sulpiride for his depressive state. From cardiac catheterization, we planned his third AVR. The electrocardiographic (ECG) QTc interval was prolonged to 0.48 seconds on this admission. In March 1992 syncopal attack appeared suddenly, and his monitor ECG revealed frequent polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (VT) and Torsade de Pointes (Tdp). These arrhythmias stopped by emergent cardiac pacing. After discontinuing these psychotropic drugs, no ventricular arrhythmias appeared. Since the patient complained severe insomnia one month before operation, the diminished dose of psychotropic drugs (promethazine and levomepromazine) was readministered. Ten days after the operation, syncopal attack reappeared and his ECG recorded frequent VT and Tdp. During both syncopal attacks his serum potassium and magnesium were within normal limits. Two days later, he died from multi-organ failure. We concluded that life-threatening arrhythmias such as VT and Tdp might develop under the administration of mild psychotropic drugs (promethazine or levomepromazine), therefore, must better take a care of ECG changes in cases of using any psychotropic drugs.
1. Lindane (60 mg/kg) administered orally to rats increased liver cytochrome P-450 content and superoxide radical (O2-.) generation 24 h after treatment, while formation of thiobarbituric acid reactants and NADPH/ADP-supported microsomal chemiluminescence were significantly increased 4 h after treatment. 2. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase decreased 6 h after lindane treatment and SOD/O2-. ratio progressively decreased during 4 to 24 h after lindane treatment. 3. Morphological evidence of hepatic cell injury after lindane treatment was seen at all times studied, and appeared to increase with time. 4. Lindane administration results in time-dependent oxidative stress in liver which involves an early component (4-6 h) related to the reductive metabolism of lindane, and a late component (24 h) associated with the induction of cytochrome P-450; the biochemical changes correlated with the observed morphological lesions.
Despite low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis, the incidence of venographically detected, residual deep vein thrombosis after hip and knee arthroplasty remains high, at approximately 15% and 30%, respectively. Most of these thrombi are asymptomatic and of unknown clinical significance. Nevertheless, because they have the potential to grow, limiting prophylaxis to the in-hospital period may provide inadequate protection.
We studied a cohort of 1984 consecutive patients who had hip or knee arthroplasty at 1 of 28 participating hospitals. Patients received enoxaparin prophylaxis, 30 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours for up to 14 days, and underwent predischarge compression ultrasonography. Study end points were symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during and after prophylaxis, asymptomatic venous thrombosis detected by predischarge compression ultrasonography, and major hemorrhage. The duration of follow-up was 84 days.
Enoxaparin treatment was started a mean (+/- SD) of 17.9 +/- 10.4 hours after the completion of surgery and was given for a mean of 18.0 +/- 6.9 doses. Eighty-two patients (4.1%; 95% confidence interval, 3.3%-5.0%) developed venous thromboembolism. The rates of thromboembolic events during and after prophylaxis were 2.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Only 3 patients (0.15%) had abnormal predischarge compression ultrasonography. Three patients (0.15%) died of pulmonary embolism. Major hemorrhage occurred in 58 patients (2.9%; 95% confidence interval, 2.2%-3.7%).
Postoperative prophylaxis with enoxaparin for a mean of 9 days is associated with a clinically acceptable rate of symptomatic venous thromboembolism and major hemorrhage. Predischarge compression ultrasonography cannot be justified.
Dimethylaminoethanol pyroglutamate (DMAE p-Glu) is a compound resulting from the reaction between dimethylaminoethanol (an indirect precursor of acetylcholine) and pyroglutamic acid (a cyclic derivative of glutamic acid having procholinergic properties and promnesic effects in both animals and man).
The present study undertook preclinical and clinical evaluations to test a potential therapeutic utility for DMAE p-Glu in cognitive impairments related to central cholinergic deficit.
In preclinical study, DMAE p-Glu was studied in rats by intracerebral microdialysis in conscious freely moving animals, on performance of rats in the Morris water maze test of spatial memory, and on the deficit in passive avoidance behavior induced by scopolamine. The clinical study examined the effect of DMAE p-Glu on cognitive deficits induced by an intravenous injection of scopolamine in healthy young male subjects.
In rat experiments, DMAE p-Glu increased the extracellular levels of choline and acetylcholine in the medial prefrontal cortex, as assessed by intracerebral microdialysis, improved performance in a test of spatial memory, and reduced scopolamine-induced memory deficit in passive avoidance behavior. Clinical study results show that scopolamine induced a memory deficit and that DMAE p-Glu produced a significant positive effect on scores in the Buschke test, as well as a slight but significant difference on choice reaction time.
These results indicate that DMAE p-Glu reduces the deleterious effect of scopolamine on long-term memory in healthy volunteers and suggest that DMAE p-Glu might be effective in reducing memory deficits in patients with cognitive impairment.
N-substituted benztropine analogs are potent dopamine uptake inhibitors that display pharmacokinetic/dynamic properties consistent with the profile of a substitute medication for cocaine addiction.
The purpose of the present experiments was to characterize in rats the addictive-like properties of one such analog, 3 alpha-[bis(4'-fluorophenyl)methoxy]-tropane (AHN-1055), incorporating probes of its stimulant and incentive/motivational effects and of its ability to influence cocaine self-administration.
We used open field activity and drug self-administration assays. To examine the effects of AHN-1055 on locomotor behavior, the analog was administered alone (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and in combination with cocaine (15 mg/kg i.p.). The influence of AHN-1055 on cocaine's intake was studied by administering the analog (0, 3, and 10 mg/kg i.p.) before the start of the self-administration sessions. To compare the addictive-like properties of AHN-1055 and cocaine, progressive ratio performance and abstinence-induced context-conditioned relapse were evaluated.
AHN-1055 evoked robust and sustained locomotor activity when administered alone and increased cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation. Notably, the analog showed by comparison to cocaine weak reinforcing efficacy in a modified progressive ratio schedule of drug reinforcement, and contrary to cocaine, it showed no ability to promote context-conditioned relapse to drug seeking following stable self-administration and abstinence. Further, AHN-1055 treatment blocked cocaine intake dose-dependently in rats with a steady history of cocaine self-administration without reducing responding for sucrose, a natural reward.
These findings demonstrate essential psychopharmacological differences between AHN-1055 and cocaine and highlight important properties of the analog as a possible pharmacotherapy in cocaine addiction.
The role of myosin phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in regulating the invasiveness of metastatic cancer cells was investigated using the Dunning rat prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line, Mat Ly Lu, and in vitro invasion assay. Treatment with MLCK inhibitors resulted in marked reduction of invasiveness, which was principally due to impaired cellular motility, whereas the ability to survive and proliferate, to adhere to matrix, and to secrete gelatinases were minimally affected.
Oxiracetam administered systemically to rats as a 14C radiolabelled drug (200 mg/kg p.o. or 100 mg/kg intra-artery) enters the brain and is found unmetabolized above all in some of the brain areas functionally involved in the modulation of cognitive processes. Among the brain areas examined, the largest amount of compound was recovered in septum, followed by hippocampus; a smaller amount was found in cerebral cortex and striatum. 14C oxiracetam administered directly into the lateral ventricles of the brain presented a similar pattern of distribution, indicating that the tropism of the drug for the above brain areas does not depend on its route of administration. The amounts of oxiracetam that could reach the brain after systemically administered pharmacologically active doses were also estimated. These amounts (1.9 to 19 nmols/rat) were delivered through a permanently implanted cannula, into the lateral ventricles of the brains of conscious, freely moving rats. In this experimental condition oxiracetam dose-dependently antagonized the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.66 mg/kg s.c.). The above findings clearly indicate that oxiracetam enters the brain and directly exerts its pharmacological activity there.
The CYP2D6*10 allele is the most common allele with a frequency ranging from 51.3 to 70% and correlated with a significantly reduced metabolic activity in a Chinese population. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the CYP2D6*10 allele has an impact on the postoperative analgesia effect of tramadol in Chinese patients recovering from major abdominal surgery.
A prospective study design was used and 70 gastric cancer patients recovering from gastrectomy were enrolled. After receiving a loading dose i.v., patients could self-administer doses of the drug combination (10 mg/ml tramadol plus 0.3 mg/ml metoclopramide) via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Blood samples were collected after induction of anesthesia. The CYP2D6*10 C188T polymorphism was analyzed by means of polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Demographic data among groups with different genotypes were analyzed using analysis of variance. The total consumption of tramadol between the three genotype groups for 48 h was compared.
The allele frequency of CYP2D6*10 is 52.4%; patients were categorized into three groups according to the CYP2D6 genotype: patients without CYP2D6*10 (group I, n=17), patients heterozygous for CYP2D6*10 (group II, n=26), and patients homozygous for CYP2D6*10 (group III, n=20). The demographic data among the three groups were comparable. The total consumption of tramadol for 48 h in group III was significantly higher than that in groups I and II, while it did not differ between groups I and II.
This study indicates that the CYP2D6*10 allele has significant impact on analgesia with tramadol in a Chinese population. Pharmacogenetics may explain some of the varying responses to pain medication in postoperative patients.
A better understanding of secreted proteins may lead to the discovery of new biomarkers, which, along with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer patients.
Conditioned medium was collected from LNCaP cells following stimulation with methyltrienolone (R1881), 17beta-estradiol (estradiol), or interleukin-6 and analyzed for differential protein expression with surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, immunoblots, and ELISA were used to measure beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) message and protein levels in cells, conditioned medium, and serum.
Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight revealed that many peaks were induced or repressed following stimulation with R1881 or estradiol. A peak of interest centered at 11.8 kDa was chosen for additional analysis. Immunodepletion identified the peak of interest as B2M. Reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblots confirmed that PSA and B2M were induced by R1881. However, unlike PSA, B2M was not increased on stimulation with estradiol or interleukin-6. Human B2M is identified in the serum of mice bearing human prostate cancer xenograft. B2M is expressed in human prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. Serum B2M levels are elevated in patients with metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer.
B2M is a secreted protein expressed in prostate cancer, which is more specific for androgen stimulation than PSA under the conditions tested. Additional studies are warranted to explore if B2M is as useful marker for prostate cancer. Identification of proteins secreted from cancer cells in preclinical models may be a useful strategy for biomarker discovery.
Neuroleptics given chronically to rats induce behavioral sequelae which mimic tardive dyskinesia in some respects. The intent of this study was to investigate the ultrastructural correlates of oral dyskinesias (vacuous chewing movements [VCMs]), induced by chronic haloperidol treatment. After 6 months of treatment, rats were divided into low or high VCM groups. Rats in the high VCM group were either sacrificed on drug or were withdrawn from drug for 4 weeks. Ultrastructural analyses of the striatum indicated that synaptic density: 1) was significantly decreased in both the low and high VCM groups compared to normal controls; 2) was more profoundly decreased in the high VCM group as compared to the low VCM group; and 3) recovered to normal following drug withdrawal. Compared to controls, the density of asymmetric synapses was reduced by a similar magnitude in both the low and high VCM groups, suggesting that this change is a result of haloperidol treatment and independent of VCMs. Conversely, the density of symmetric synapses was reduced compared to normal, only in the high VCM group, suggesting that this change is specifically related to the expression of VCMs. In addition, mitochondrial profiles were hypertrophied and less frequent in the high VCM group in comparison to controls; size, but not number, recovered following drug withdrawal. These results identify distinct ultrastructural correlates of chronic haloperidol treatment that are unique to rats that develop VCMs and suggest that these ultrastructural features may play a role in the pathophysiology of oral dyskinesias in rats.
The role of cyclosporine alone or in combination with amphotericin B in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in 47 marrow transplant recipients. Cyclosporine alone was given to 21 patients and 10 received cyclosporine plus amphotericin B. These were compared with 16 patients who received methotrexate and amphotericin B. Serum creatinine doubled within 14-30 days in 8 of 21 patients who received only cyclosporine. Of 16 patients given amphotericin B in conjunction with methotrexate, only 3 doubled their serum creatinine within 5 days of starting amphotericin B. In contrast, of 10 patients who received amphotericin B in combination with cyclosporine, 5 doubled and 3 tripled their serum creatinine within 5 days. This increase in creatinine was significantly greater than that seen in patients receiving cyclosporine alone or methotrexate and amphotericin B combined. These results suggest that administration of cyclosporine and amphotericin B simultaneously should be undertaken with caution to avoid severe renal toxicity.
To identify susceptibility loci for schizophrenia, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population (GWAS: 746 individuals with schizophrenia and 1,599 healthy controls; validation: 4,027 individuals with schizophrenia and 5,603 healthy controls). We identified two susceptibility loci for schizophrenia at 6p21-p22.1 (rs1233710 in an intron of ZKSCAN4, P(combined) = 4.76 × 10(-11), odds ratio (OR) = 0.79; rs1635 in an exon of NKAPL, P(combined) = 6.91 × 10(-12), OR = 0.78; rs2142731 in an intron of PGBD1, P(combined) = 5.14 × 10(-10), OR = 0.79) and 11p11.2 (rs11038167 near the 5' UTR of TSPAN18, P(combined) = 1.09 × 10(-11), OR = 1.29; rs11038172, P(combined) = 7.21 × 10(-10), OR = 1.25; rs835784, P(combined) = 2.73 × 10(-11), OR = 1.27). These results add to previous evidence of susceptibility loci for schizophrenia at 6p21-p22.1 in the Han Chinese population. We found that NKAPL and ZKSCAN4 were expressed in postnatal day 0 (P0) mouse brain. These findings may lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
Gastric cancer, including the cardia and non-cardia types, is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To identify genetic risk variants for non-cardia gastric cancer, we performed a genome-wide association study in 3,279 individuals (1,006 with non-cardia gastric cancer and 2,273 controls) of Chinese descent. We replicated significant associations in an additional 6,897 subjects (3,288 with non-cardia gastric cancer and 3,609 controls). We identified two new susceptibility loci for non-cardia gastric cancer at 5p13.1 (rs13361707 in the region including PTGER4 and PRKAA1; odds ratio (OR) = 1.41; P = 7.6 × 10(-29)) and 3q13.31 (rs9841504 in ZBTB20; OR = 0.76; P = 1.7 × 10(-9)). Imputation analyses also confirmed previously reported associations of rs2294008 and rs2976392 on 8q24, rs4072037 on 1q22 and rs13042395 on 20p13 with non-cardia gastric cancer susceptibility in the Han Chinese population.
