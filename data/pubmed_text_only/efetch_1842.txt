To explore the effect of traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCM) for nourishing liver and kidney, clearing meridians and removing toxic substances, on the neurobehavioral manifestations and the activity of the dopamine D2 receptor in rat with levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID).
The rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) was established by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into right substantia nigra of brain, then, the model of LID in rat was produced by injecting levodopa (LD) and benserazide for 4 weeks. The rats were divided into normal control group, 4-week LD treated group, 4-week LD plus TCM treated group, 8-week LD treated group, and 8-week LD plus TCM treated group, and the effect of the TCM on neurobehavioral manifestations was observed. The radioligand binding assay (RLBA) and Scatchard drawing were used to measure the maximal binding capacity of receptor (Bmax) and equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the dopamine D2 receptor in corpora striatum.
Compared with the 4-week LD treated group and 8-week LD treated group, TCM could decrease abnormal involuntary movement scores of the rats with LID; the RLBA revealed that the dopamine D2 receptor Bmax significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01) and the KD significantly decreased (P<0.05).
TCM can improve the activity of the dopamine D2 receptor and relieve the symptoms of LID.
The intestinal-derived secondary bile acid (BA) lithocholic acid (LCA) is hepatotoxic and is implicated in the pathogenesis of cholestatic diseases. LCA is an endogenous ligand of the xenobiotic nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR), but there is currently no consensus on the respective roles of hepatic and intestinal PXR in mediating protection against LCA in vivo. Under the conditions reported here, we show that mice lacking Pxr are resistant to LCA-mediated hepatotoxicity. This unexpected phenotype is found in association with enhanced urinary BA excretion and elevated basal expression of drug metabolism enzymes and the hepatic sulfate donor synthesis enzyme Papss2 in Pxr(-/-) mice. By subsequently comparing molecular responses to dietary and intraperitoneal administration of LCA, we made two other significant observations: 1) LCA feeding induces intestinal, but not hepatic, drug-metabolizing enzymes in a largely Pxr-independent manner; and 2) in contrast to LCA feeding, bypassing first-pass gut transit by intraperitoneal administration of LCA did induce hepatic detoxification machinery and in a Pxr-dependent manner. These data reconcile important discrepancies in the reported molecular responses to this BA and suggest that Pxr plays only a limited role in mediating responses to gut-derived LCA. Furthermore, the route of administration must be considered in the future planning and interpretation of experiments designed to assess hepatic responses to BAs, orally administered pharmaceuticals, and dietary toxins.
We observed the development of Horner's syndrome 25 min after the intrapleural administration of 30 cc of 0.5% bupivacaine to a patient with post-herpetic neuralgia in the thoracic region. The patient reported immediate relief of pain. There was no change in blood pressure or pulse rate, and no discernible level of anesthesia to pinprick was detected.
Niemann-Pick type C disease is an inherited disorder characterized by lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and the mutant gene has recently been identified. The predicted gene product is a transmembrane protein showing homology to proteins involved in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A and the sterol regulatory element binding protein cleavage-activating protein. Recent investigations have established a peroxisomal deficiency, which raised the question of whether peroxisomal proliferation could affect this cholesterol-processing error. Mutant mice with Niemann-Pick type C disease were treated with the peroxisomal inducer perfluorooctanoic acid, which increased peroxisomal beta-oxidation and catalase activity to the same level as in control mice. Not only the peroxisomal, but also the lysosomal malfunctions were corrected and the cholesterol content was decreased. Clofibrate, another peroxisomal inducer, restored both peroxisomal enzyme activities and ubiquinone content. It appears that in Niemann-Pick type C disease treatment with appropriate peroxisomal inducers restores basic cellular functions, indicating a relationship between peroxisomes and cholesterol homeostasis, and thereby may effectively interfere with the development of the disease.
The efficacy and safety of the low dose monophasic oral contraceptive (OC) combination containing 30 micrograms of ethinylestradiol (EE) and 2.0 mg of dienogest (DNG) (EE/DNG) was evaluated in a prospective, open-label, multicenter, uncontrolled, phase III trial. The trial was carried out in six hospitals by 36 investigators in the Czech Republic, and included 557 healthy women (aged 18-35 years), over 12 cycles, with a total of 6051 cycles. EE/DNG provided a reliable ovulation inhibition. The contraceptive efficacy study showed an adjusted Pearl index of 0.198 on the basis of three pregnancies occurring during 6051 cycles. EE/DNG provided good cycle control, reduced the incidence of intermenstrual bleedings, the intensity of menstrual bleeding and frequency of dysmenorrhea. Due to the antiandrogenic properties of the progestogen component DNG, EE/DNG improved androgen-related conditions, such as skin blemishes, hair greasiness and acne vulgaris. From 108 women with acne, 62 (57%) improved after the 6th cycle, and 16 (15%) were healed. Similar changes were found after cycle 12. Breast tenderness and headache were the most frequent of the common complaints due to treatment with EE/DNG. The frequency of all complaints decreased steadily over time. Only 7.7% of subjects discontinued due to adverse reactions. No thrombophlebitic events were noticed.
A causal relationship between treatment with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) at therapeutic doses and cases of dilated cardiomyopathy has been suspected, but not definitely evidenced. We present a case of a dilated cardiomyopathy, which seemed idiopathic, but occurred during treatment with imipramine and recovered after its withdrawal. For the first recorded time, the cardiomyopathy recurred 9 years later, after a 2-year period of treatment with amitriptyline and lithium, and recovered again 1 year after both psychotropic drugs withdrawal. New arguments for the existence of TCA-induced dilated cardiomyopathy are brought.
To determine urinary albumin in a minute amount, a gel-filtration high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure was newly established. When urine of a normal rat was eluted isocratically at 0.6 ml/min by 100 mM Na sulfate in 20 mM Na, K-phosphate (pH 7.4), approximately 6 hrs for complete elution of urinary peak-forming substances was needed. Retention time of albumin was found to be 22.9 min. To shorten the analytic time, 100 mM Na sulfate in 20 mM Na, K-phosphate (pH 7.4) was first used during a 30 min period for separation of albumin. A mixture of acetonitrile/the above solvent = 3/7 (v/v) was then flushed to wash away the peak-forming substances. By this elution mode, the analytic time could be reduced to 3 hrs. When the validity of this procedure was tested, the detection limit of albumin was 0.04 microgram/injection, and a linearity was observed between 0.2 and 50 micrograms/injection. Rats then received single subcutaneous injections of puromycin aminonucleoside, which is a nephrotoxic agent. The plasma albumin concentrations fell at 5, 10 and 15 days after the administration, and the urinary excretions of albumin rose from the 1st day up to the 15th day. The results denoted that our procedure could be a good evaluative tool for nephrotoxicity studies where albuminuria was manifested.
Four patients with oral contraceptive associated hepatic adenoma have been studied and the literature reviewed. Clinically, these patients can be divided into ruptured and nonruptured hepatoma groups. In instances of ruptured hepatomas, resection only sufficient to control hemorrhage definitely is recommended. In instances of nonruptured hepatomas, major resection should only be attempted by skilled surgeons, and small multiple lesions should be observed. These management principles will deserve re-evaluation as more experience with these tumors accumulates. Until then, a conservative approach is indicated. This includes the avoidance of oral contraception until the biochemistry of these tumors is better clarified.
Although cytochrome-c oxidase (CCO) is a copper-dependent enzyme, the effect of maternal copper deficiency on the expression of CCO activity during postnatal development of the neonatal rat heart has not been investigated extensively. Here, we show that CCO activity in heart mitochondria isolated from neonates of copper-deficient dams did not exhibit significant reductions until postnatal days (PND) 15 and 21. In addition, immunoblot analysis indicated that the CCO subunit (Cox-1) was reduced on postnatal Days 10 and 21, and that Cox-4 was reduced on PND 21 in heart mitochondria of the neonates from copper-deficient dams. These findings indicate that the impairment of CCO activity in neonatal heart by maternal copper deficiency occurs late in the postnatal heart development. Furthermore, the concurrent reductions in Cox-1 and Cox-4 suggest that the impaired CCO activity reflects a CCO deficiency in heart mitochondria. CCO activity and Cox-1 in heart mitochondria were not fully restored by 6 weeks of postweaning copper repletion in the pups of copper-deficient dams. This indicates that prolonged maternal intake of moderately low dietary copper produces CCO deficiency in cardiac mitochondria of neonates during late postnatal heart development, after terminal differentiation of cardiomyocytes occurs. The resistance of CCO deficiency to repair by dietary copper supplementation may be related to the relatively slow turnover of the affected mitochondria in the terminally differentiated heart.
The vascular disrupting agent combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) causes major regression of animal tumours when given as combination therapy.
Patients with advanced cancer refractory to standard therapy were treated with CA4P as a 10-min infusion, 20 h before carboplatin, paclitaxel, or paclitaxel, followed by carboplatin.
Combretastatin A4 phosphate was escalated from 36 to 54 mg m(-2) with the carboplatin area under the concentration curve (AUC) 4-5, from 27 to 54 mg m(-2) with paclitaxel 135-175 mg m(-2), and from 54 to 72 mg m(-2) with carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg m(-2). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was seen in 17%, and thrombocytopenia only in 4% of 46 patients. Grade 1-3 hypertension (26% of patients) and grade 1-3 tumour pain (65% of patients) were the most typical non-haematological toxicities. Dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 hypertension or grade 3 ataxia was seen in two patients at 72 mg m(-2). Responses were seen in 10 of 46 (22%) patients with ovarian, oesophageal, small-cell lung cancer, and melanoma.
The combination of CA4P with carboplatin and paclitaxel was well tolerated in the majority of patients with adequate premedication and had antitumour activity in patients who were heavily pretreated.
Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) improves non-oncological neuropathies. We tested oral ALC (1 g tid) for 8 weeks in 25 patients with neuropathy grade 3 (common toxicity criteria--CTC) during paclitaxel or cisplatin therapy, or grade 2 persisting for at least three months after discontinuing the drugs. An independent neurologist assessed patients before and after ALC. All patients except one reported symptomatic relief, and only two described grade 1 nausea. The sensory neuropathy grade improved in 15 of 25 (60%), and motor neuropathy in 11 of 14 patients (79%). Total neuropathy score (TNS) that included neurophysiological measures improved in 23 (92%). Amelioration of sensory amplitude and conduction velocity (sural and peroneal nerves) was measured in 22 and 21 patients, respectively. Symptomatic improvement persisted in 12 of 13 evaluable patients at median 13 months after ALC. In view of its effect in improving established paclitaxel- and cisplatin-neuropathy, we recommend ALC testing in preventing progression or revert symptoms during neurotoxic chemotherapy.
Parenteral application of the active metabolite of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, has been anticipated to have remarkable efficacy in secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, in a reproduction seg. I study in rats, poor reproductive performance was reflected in a decrease in the number of matings, implantations and live births. These changes were though reversible after treatment with the compound was discontinued. In order to clarify the mechanism of these reversible toxicities, the following were examined in female rats treated with the D3 metabolite: 1. effect on the estrous cycle (no treatment for 2 weeks, treatment for 3 weeks and recovery for 2 weeks), and 2. effect on the maintenance of pregnancy (treatment for 2 weeks before mating and during the gestation period). In both groups, the levels of calcium, calcitonin, PTH and progesterone in serum were measured, and histopathological examination of the thyroid, parathyroid, ovary and uterus was carried out. The following results were observed: 1) disturbance of the estrous cycle, 2) hypofunctional changes in the corpus luteum in the ovary, and the epithelium, endometrium and uterine gland in the uterus with a decrease in the serum progesterone level and 3) hypercalcemia with a decrease in calcitonin or PTH levels in serum with morphological changes including atrophy and cyst-formation in the parathyroid. However, the above changes were reversible, and recovery was observed after administration of the compound was discontinued. These results indicate that the hypercalcemia caused by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 disrupts endocrinological homeostasis which in turn temporarily disrupts the female reproductive system. Furthermore, it was suggested that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 itself directly influences on endocrinological organs (hypothalamus, pituitary, parathyroid and thyroid) and reproductive organs (ovary and uterus).
Plasma catecholamines, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and plasma cortisol during hypotension induced by sodium nitroprusside and nicardipine were studied in 27 mongrel dogs under 0.87% halothane in oxygen. They were randomly divided into three groups: sodium nitroprusside (group S: n = 8), nicardipine (group N: n = 8) and controls (group C: n = 9). Group C received no vasodilator therapy and served as a control. Mean arterial pressure was reduced and maintained at 60 mmHg for 60 minutes in hypotensive groups. No changes were noted in plasma catecholamines and plasma cortisol in group C throughout the experiment, but plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone decreased progressively. During hypotension induced by sodium nitroprusside and nicardipine, plasma epinephrine was significantly higher than the control value. However, after the hypotensive drugs were discontinued, plasma epinephrine decreased slightly. During and after induced hypotension, plasma renin activity of group N and group S were significantly higher than the control values. The highest levels of plasma renin activity 36.7 ng.ml-1.hr-1 in group N and 23.2 ng.ml-1.hr-1 in group S were observed. Plasma aldosterone concentration was significantly higher than the control value in group N. The maximum increase occurred 30 minutes after discontinuation of the nicardipine and the highest concentration of plasma aldosterone was three times control value. In contrast, in group S, plasma aldosterone was unchanged from the control value. Plasma cortisol concentration of group N was significantly increased than the control value. However, in group S, plasma cortisol concentration showed a slight but not significant increase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To impact on the development of clinical congestive heart failure as a complication of doxorubicin therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction was monitored with serial resting radionuclide angiocardiography in 1,487 patients with cancer over a seven-year period in both university and community hospital environments. A high-risk subset of 282 patients was selected for retrospective analysis of their clinical outcome. High-risk patients were identified by one or two of the following three criteria: decline of 10 percent or more in absolute left ventricular ejection fraction from a normal baseline to 50 percent or less; high cumulative dose of doxorubicin (more than 450 mg/m2); abnormal baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 50 percent). Clinical congestive heart failure occurred in 46 (16 percent) during the treatment period, and in an additional three patients (1.3 percent) at last follow-up examination 11.8 +/- 14.2 months following discontinuation of doxorubicin. Total cumulative dosages of doxorubicin that precipitated congestive heart failure (75 to 1,095 mg/m2) and those that did not (30 to 880 mg/m2) varied widely. Decline of 10 percent or more in absolute left ventricular ejection fraction to a value of 50 percent or less preceded administration of the final dose of doxorubicin that precipitated clinical congestive heart failure in the majority of patients in whom congestive heart failure developed. Clinical congestive heart failure improved in 87 percent given routine therapy with digitalis, diuretics, and/or vasodilators. Criteria for monitoring left ventricular ejection fraction and discontinuing doxorubicin were formulated. The occurrence of clinical congestive heart failure was compared in those patients whose management was concordant with proposed criteria (Group A) and in those whose management was not (Group B). Group A had a lower incidence of congestive heart failure compared with Group B (2.9 percent versus 20.8 percent, p less than 0.001) and had only mild congestive heart failure that resolved with treatment (n = 2) and no deaths due to congestive heart failure. Multivariate analysis with proportional-hazards regression (Cox's model) demonstrated a fourfold reduction in the incidence of congestive heart failure independent of other clinical predictor variables in those patients whose management was concordant with proposed guideline criteria. The incidence, persistence, late development, predictability, and reversibility of clinical congestive heart failure were comparable in university and community hospital settings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
A 5-year-old girl was admitted with a 3-day history of speech disorder and gait abnormality. She had been diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy and was given phenytoin 2 months before admission to our hospital. On physical examination, she had severe lingual-facial-buccal extrapyramidal movements, slurred speech, and ataxic gait. During examination, she was repetitively scratching her scalp with her right hand every 30 to 60 seconds. Serum phenytoin level was 10 microg/mL (normal 8-20 microg/mL). Electroencephalography showed diffuse slow waves. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal. During hospitalization, her abnormal findings were thought to be attributable to phenytoin; it was immediately discontinued, and biperiden was initiated. After biperiden was administered, her abnormal movements markedly decreased; later, they almost completely disappeared. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that severe dyskinesia can be observed during phenytoin therapy and that biperiden can be successfully used in the treatment of this unpleasant condition.
Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors can lead to serious hypomagnesaemia. Intestinal magnesium absorption takes place by passive paracellular and active transcellular transport. It has been hypothesized that proton pump inhibitors impair the active transcellular magnesium transport. The resulting hypomagnesaemia may cause hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcaemia and hypokalaemia. Proton pump inhibitor-induced hypomagnesaemia is reversible: it resolves when proton pump inhibitors are stopped. The indication for long-term proton pump inhibitor treatment should be evaluated periodically.
This follow-up multicenter analysis is based on 362 pancreas allograft recipients at 14 institutions who were given tacrolimus between 1 May 1994 and 15 November 1995. Three groups were studied: (1) recipients given tacrolimus initially for induction and maintenance therapy (n = 250; 215 without, 35 with, a concurrent bone marrow transplant), (2) recipients who converted to tacrolimus for rescue or rejection therapy (n = 89), and (3) recipients who converted to tacrolimus for other reasons (n = 23). Of 215 recipients without a bone marrow transplant in the induction group, 166 (77%) underwent a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant (SPK), 29 (14%) a pancreas transplant alone (PTA), and 20 (9%) a pancreas after previous kidney transplant (PAK). Initial antibody therapy was given to 185 (86%) recipients. All 215 received tacrolimus and prednisone; 202 (94%) also received azathioprine (AZA) and 11 (5%) mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). The most common side effects of tacrolimus were neurotoxicity in 21%, nephrotoxicity in 21%, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in 13%, and diabetogenicity in 13% of these recipients. No recipient in this group developed new-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Of 89 recipients in the rescue group, 71 (79%) had an SPK, 11 (13%) a PTA, and 7 (8%) a PAK. Before conversion, all had been on cyclosporine (CsA)-based immunosuppression; 74% of them had 2 or more rejection episodes previously. The most common side effects were nephrotoxicity in 27%, neurotoxicity in 26%, GI toxicity in 18%, and diabetogenicity in 8% of these recipients. No recipient in this group developed new-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In the induction group patient survival at 1 yr was 98% for SPK, 79% for PTA, and 100% for PAK recipients. According to a matched-pair analysis, pancreas graft survival for SPK recipients at 1 yr was 88% with tacrolimus vs. 73% with CsA (p = 0.002); for PTA recipients, 68% vs. 70% (p > 0.35); and for PAK recipients, 85% vs. 65% (p = 0.13). Graft loss from rejection was not different with tacrolimus vs. CsA in all 3 pancreas recipient categories. At 1 yr, 17% of recipients had converted from tacrolimus to CsA for diabetogenicity, nephrotoxicity, or rejection; 23% had converted from AZA to MMF. The incidence of post-transplant lymphoma was < 2%. In the rescue group, patient survival rates at 1 yr were 96% for SPK, 100% for PTA, and 86% for PAK recipients (p < 0.08). Pancreas graft survival at 1 yr was 89% for SPK, 58% for PTA, and 69% for PAK recipients (p = 0.004). Graft loss from rejection was significantly lower for SPK vs. PTA or PAK recipients. At 1 yr, 20% of recipients had reconverted from tacrolimus to CsA for rejection, neurotoxicity, or nephrotoxicity; 19% had converted from AZA to MMF. There were no post-transplant lymphomas in the rescue group. This follow-up multicenter analysis shows that tacrolimus after pancreas transplantation is associated with high graft survival rates when used for induction and with high graft salvage rates when used for rescue therapy. The rate of graft loss from rejection is low in all 3 pancreas recipient categories. The overall incidence of new-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is < 1%, as is the incidence of post-transplant lymphoma. Converting from tacrolimus to CsA and, in patients on tacrolimus, from AZA to MMF, is safe; interchangeable use of drugs appears to be of immunologic benefit. To determine the best immunosuppressive regimen after pancreas transplantation, a prospective randomized study comparing tacrolimus and MMF vs. Neoral plus MMF is mandatory.
Glucocorticosteroid injections into the shoulder are commonly used in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinitis. These injections rarely result in any serious complications and are generally considered a safe therapeutic intervention. Despite the extensive application of this treatment, there have been no reports of dysphonia occurring after corticosteroid injection into the subacromial space. We report the case of a 66-yr-old man with dysphonia after undergoing subacromial glucocorticosteroid injection for treatment of rotator cuff tendinitis.
We present a case of protein-losing cytomegalovirus gastritis in a previously immunocompetent 14-year-old Japanese girl that occurred during treatment of drug (zonisamide)-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome with hepatic failure. Her hepatic failure and symptoms of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were successfully treated with intravenous prednisolone and infusion of fresh-frozen plasma or albumin, as the occasion demanded. However, during the course of treatment, she complained of severe epigastralgia together with hypoproteinemia, and cytomegalovirus gastritis was found by endoscopic and histological examinations. The possible mechanism by which cytomegalovirus gastritis occurred in the present case and effective diagnostic procedures are discussed.
Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation is a critical component of neointimal formation in many models of vascular injury and in human lesions as well. Cell-cycle inhibition by gene transfer techniques can block SMC proliferation and lesion formation in animal models, although these methods are not yet applicable to the treatment of human disease. Flavopiridol is a recently identified, potent, orally available cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.
Using human aortic SMCs, we found that flavopiridol in concentrations as low as 75 nmol/L resulted in nearly complete inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced and thrombin-induced proliferation. At this dose, flavopiridol inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase activity, as measured by histone H1 phosphorylation, but had no effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Induction of the cell cycle-related proteins cyclin D1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein was also blocked by flavopiridol. Flavopiridol had no effect on cellular viability. To test whether flavopiridol had a similar activity in vivo when administered orally, we examined neointimal formation in rat carotid arteries after balloon injury. Flavopiridol 5 mg/kg reduced neointimal area by 35% and 39% at 7 and 14 days, respectively, after injury.
Flavopiridol inhibits SMC growth in vitro and in vivo. Its oral availability and selectivity for cyclin-dependent kinases make it a potential therapeutic tool in the treatment of SMC-rich vascular lesions.
The comparative pharmacokinetic properties of lidocaine, bupivacaine, etidocaine and mepivacaine were investigated in convulsing and non-convulsing dogs. The same dose of a given local anaesthetic was administered as either a 30-s intravenous (IV) bolus to produce convulsions or as a 15-min IV infusion producing no convulsions. Derived pharmacokinetic data were found to be different in convulsing and non-convulsing animals. Total body clearance was found to be significantly reduced for lidocaine (29%, P less than 0.05), bupivacaine (31%, P less than 0.05), etidocaine (60%, P less than 0.01) and mepivacaine (68%, P less than 0.01) in convulsing animals. Increases in elimination half-life only achieved statistical significance in mepivacaine-treated animals (non-convulsing 45.2 min, convulsing 105.4 min, P less than 0.01). Overall, the most profound effects of convulsions on pharmacokinetic data were seen with mepivacaine. Convulsions were associated with increases in heart rate ranging from 117% (lidocaine, P less than 0.05) to 129% (mepivacaine, P less than 0.05), increases in cardiac output ranging from 78% (mepivacaine) to 232% (bupivacaine, P less than 0.05) and increases in mean arterial pressure ranging from 45% (lidocaine, P less than 0.05) to 80% (bupivacaine, P less than 0.05). The results suggest that when local anaesthetic-induced seizures occur in man, it cannot be assumed that these drugs will be distributed and eliminated as predicted by intravenous infusion of non-toxic doses.
Cocaine strengthens excitatory synapses onto midbrain dopamine neurons through the synaptic delivery of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors. This cocaine-evoked plasticity depends on NMDA receptor activation, but its behavioral significance in the context of addiction remains elusive. Here, we generated mice lacking the GluR1, GluR2, or NR1 receptor subunits selectively in dopamine neurons. We report that in midbrain slices of cocaine-treated mice, synaptic transmission was no longer strengthened when GluR1 or NR1 was abolished, while in the respective mice the drug still induced normal conditioned place preference and locomotor sensitization. In contrast, extinction of drug-seeking behavior was absent in mice lacking GluR1, while in the NR1 mutant mice reinstatement was abolished. In conclusion, cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity does not mediate concurrent short-term behavioral effects of the drug but may initiate adaptive changes eventually leading to the persistence of drug-seeking behavior.
In humans, hibernoma is a very rare, benign neoplasm of brown adipose tissue (BAT) that typically occurs at subcutaneous locations and is successfully treated by surgical excision. No single cause has been accepted to explain these very rare human tumors. In contrast, spontaneous hibernoma in rats is rare, often malignant, usually occurs in the thoracic or abdominal cavity, and metastases are common. In recent years, there has been an increased incidence of spontaneous hibernomas in rat carcinogenicity studies, but overall the occurrence remains relatively low and highly variable across studies. There have only been four reported examples of pharmaceutical-induced hibernoma in rat carcinogenicity studies. These include phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist; varenicline, a nicotine partial agonist; tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor; and hydromorphone, an opiod analgesic. Potential non-genotoxic mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of BAT activation/proliferation and/or subsequent hibernoma development in rats include: (1) physiological stimuli, (2) sympathetic stimulation, (3) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonism, and/or (4) interference or inhibition of JAK/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. The evaluation of an apparent increase of hibernoma in rats from 2-year carcinogenicity studies of novel pharmaceutical therapeutics and its relevance to human safety risk assessment is complex. One should consider: the genotoxicity of the test article, dose/exposure and safety margins, and pathophysiologic and morphologic differences and similarities of hibernoma between rats and humans. Hibernomas observed to date in carcinogenicity studies of pharmaceutical agents do not appear to be relevant for human risk at therapeutic dosages.
Augmentation of gastric mucosal cell apoptosis due to development of oxidative stress is one of the main pathogenic events in the development of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastropathy. Identification of a nontoxic, anti-apoptotic molecule is warranted for therapy against NSAID-induced gastropathy. The objective of the present study was to define the mechanism of the anti-apoptotic effect of melatonin, a nontoxic molecule which scavenges reactive oxygen species. Using an array of experimental approaches, we have shown that melatonin prevents the development of mitochondrial oxidative stress and activation of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis induced by indomethacin (a NSAID) in the gastric mucosa. Melatonin inhibits the important steps of indomethacin-induced activation of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis such as upregulation of the expression of Bax and Bak, and the downregulation of Bcl-2 and BclxL. Melatonin also prevents indomethacin-induced mitochondrial translocation of Bax and prevents the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, melatonin reduces indomethacin-mediated activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 by blocking the release of cytochrome c and finally rescues gastric mucosal cells from indomethacin-induced apoptosis as measured by the TUNEL assay. Histologic studies of gastric mucosa further document that melatonin almost completely protects against gastric damage induced by indomethacin. Thus, melatonin has significant anti-apoptotic effects to protect gastric mucosa from NSAID-induced apoptosis and gastropathy, which makes its use as potential therapy against gastric damage during NSAID treatment.
The new and potent antiarrhythmic drugs herald an exciting era in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Encainide, tocainide, and mexiletine are effective in treating acute and chronic ventricular arrhythmias. Verapamil promises to be the drug of choice for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Acetubolol provides the advantages of selective beta receptor blockade and has minimal influence on pulmonary function. Aprindine and amiodarone block conduction in accessory pathways and are very suitable for treating tachycardias associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Ethmozin is a phenothiazine derivative with potent antiarrhythmic effects. Many of these new agents are being used with striking success abroad and at specialized treatment centers for experimental research in the United States.
