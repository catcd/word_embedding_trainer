We present two patients who had life-threatening arrhythmias, which are highly likely to be secondary to amiodarone. This class III anti-arrhythmic is commonly prescribed for the acute presentation of supra-ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, occasionally its use can transform arrhythmias from benign to dangerous. These cases highlight the need for careful attention to the indications, cautions and contra-indications of amiodarone as well as the need for vigilance following initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapy.
The APOE epsilon4 allele is an established risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), yet findings are mixed for how early its effects are manifest. One reason for the mixed results could be the presence of interaction effects with other AD risk factors. Increasing evidence indicates that testosterone may play a significant role in the development of AD. The aim of the present study was to examine the potential interaction of testosterone and APOE genotype with respect to hippocampal volume in middle age.
Participants were men from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (n = 375). The mean age was 55.9 years (range 51-59). Between-group comparisons were performed utilizing a hierarchical linear mixed model that adjusted for the nonindependence of twin data.
A significant interaction was observed between testosterone and APOE genotype (epsilon4-negative vs epsilon4-positive). Those with both low testosterone (> or =1 SD below the mean) and an epsilon4-positive status had the smallest hippocampal volumes, although comparisons with normal testosterone groups were not significant. However, individuals with low testosterone and epsilon4-negative status had significantly larger hippocampal volumes relative to all other groups. A main effect of APOE genotype on hippocampal volume was observed, but only when the APOE-by-testosterone interaction was present.
These findings demonstrate an interaction effect between testosterone and the APOE epsilon4 allele on hippocampal volume in middle-aged men, and they may suggest 2 low testosterone subgroups. Furthermore, these results allude to potential gene-gene interactions between APOE and either androgen receptor polymorphisms or genes associated with testosterone production.
Cell cycle specificity, an important feature of anticancer drugs, is commonly used in the design of combined chemotherapy. Paclitaxel is widely accepted as an G2/M phase-specific agent. However, cumulative evidences revealed that the cell cycle specificity of anticancer drugs in vitro is not always consistent as in vivo. This study was to observe the effect of paclitaxel on the cell cycle specificity in different cell models.
Effects of paclitaxel on cell apoptosis of human lymphocyte leukemia cell line Molt-4 and 17 clinical specimens of acute leukemia were investigated using flow cytometry.
Paclitaxel induced G2/M phase-specific apoptosis in exponentially growing Molt-4 cells, G0/G1 phase-specific apoptosis in high-density cultured Molt-4 cells, and S phase-specific apoptosis in acute leukemia specimens.
Paclitaxel exhibits different cell-cycle specificity in different models. Different from other studies, paclitaxel induces S phase-specific apoptosis in clinical leukemia specimens. This difference is most likely related to the growing status of the target cells.
To describe the clinical characteristics of alcohol withdrawal seizures in patients treated with a standardized protocol of short-acting benzodiazepines.
Grand mal seizures were prospectively identified in a cohort of 1044 patients consecutively admitted to an inpatient alcohol detoxification unit at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. All patients received a 72-hr structured taper of oxazepam with additional oxazepam given without limit in amount and duration in response to alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
Eleven seizures occurred for an overall rate of 1.1%. All were single grand mal seizures. Seizures occurred from 52 to 306 hr after admission, with a mean of 122 hr (5 days). A consistent relationship between the seizures and the cessation of oxazepam was noted, with peak incidence occurring 12-48 hr after the last oxazepam dose. In no case did recurrent withdrawal symptoms or delirium tremens develop after the seizure. Patients with seizures were slightly older, more likely to have had withdrawal seizures before (50% vs. 13%, p = 0.03), and had a more severe withdrawal course than controls.
Seizures continued to occur at a low but measurable rate in alcohol withdrawal treated with a short-acting benzodiazepine. Clinical characteristics of the seizures are different from that classically described in untreated patients, with the seizures being closely related to the cessation of oxazepam rather than the cessation of alcohol.
X-linked adreno-leukodystrophy is a progressive, systemic peroxisomal disorder that affects primarily nervous system myelin and axons as well as the adrenal cortex. Several divergent clinical phenotypes can occur in the same family; thus, there is no correlation between the clinical phenotype and the mutation in the ABCD1 gene in this disease. The most urgent and unresolved clinical issue is the fulminant inflammatory (immune) demyelination of the central nervous system in which a variety of cellular participants, cytokines, and chemokines are noted. A knockout mouse model exhibits mitochondrial deficits and axonal degeneration, but not inflammatory demyelination. To determine whether oxidative stress and damage might play a pathogenic role, we assessed standard biochemical and immunohistochemical markers of such activity both in our knockout mouse model and patients. We find that oxidative stress, as judged by increased immunoreactivity for the mitochondrial manganese-superoxide dismutase, is present in the knockout mouse liver, adrenal cortex, and renal cortex, tissues that normally express high levels of ABCD1 but no evidence of oxidative damage. The brain does not exhibit either oxidative stress or damage. On the other hand, both the human adrenal cortex and brain show evidence of oxidative stress (e.g. hemoxygenase-1 and manganese-superoxide dismutase) and oxidative damage, particularly from lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde). The presence of nitrotyrosylated proteins is strong circumstantial evidence for the participation of the highly toxic peroxynitrite molecule, whereas the demonstration of interferon gamma and interleukin-12 is indicative of a TH1 response in the inflammatory demyelinative lesions of the cerebral phenotype. These differences between the adreno-leukodystrophy mouse and human patients are intriguing and may provide a clue to the phenotypic divergence in this disease.
A review is presented of the drug-induced gustatory disorders that have so far been identified. Metallic, bitter or salty phantogeusias and hypogeusias, often of a dissociated type, which may even develop into ageusia have been described as side effects of treatment with some drugs. Personal observations on six cases are reported in which the gustatory disorders are attributed to the ingestion of phenylbutazone, carbamazepine, chlormezanone and baclofen. After interruption of the treatments these disorders were reversible within weeks to months.
The risk factors affecting intracranial haemorrhage in warfarinised patients are described and an attempt made to calculate the risk of haemorrhage in warfarinised patients with minor head injuries. Using the data from studies of patients with spontaneous haemorrhage while taking warfarin, guidelines for treatment and given and the likely outcome predicted.
We postulated that a novel free radical scavenger, 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one (edaravone; EDA), would attenuate inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in the liver after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge through its antioxidant effect. Rats were administered EDA (0.3, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, and 12.0 mg/kg) or the same volume of saline intravenously just after LPS (10 mg/kg) injection and then was continued intermittently every 2 h (five administrations in total). Survival was assessed for the next 24 h. In separate experiments, rats were sacrificed at 60 min, 90 min, 6 h, and 9 h after LPS injection. Serum and liver sections were collected for further analysis. Survival was improved by EDA in a dose-dependent manner up to 3 mg/kg, and maximum effects were observed at a dose of 3 mg/kg. After LPS injection, alanine aminotransferase levels increased significantly to about 1,250 IU/l in the vehicle-treated group, whereas values were blunted by about 80% by EDA. Furthermore, increases in 4-hydroxynonenal-modified proteins were also blunted in the liver by EDA. Moreover, mRNA expressions of macrophage infiltrating protein-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and MCP-5 were attenuated by EDA. As a result, increases in the number of infiltrating inflammatory cells and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 were significantly blunted in the liver by EDA. This reduction was accompanied by a significant reduction of their serum levels. In conclusion, EDA prevented liver injury by both inhibition of recruitments of inflammatory cells and expression of inflammatory cytokine levels in the liver.
The recurrence of chronic hepatitis B after liver transplantation results in increased risk for graft failure and death of patients. Lamivudine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, but resistance to this agent is common after prolonged administration.
One patient with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection developed resistance to lamivudine after 15 months of treatment. The resistance was confirmed by mutation in the HBV DNA polymerase gene. The patient was treated subsequently with adefovir dipivoxil for 7 months.
HBV DNA and HBsAg were tested negative, but HBeAb and HBsAb were positive.
This study provides an evidence that adefovir dipivoxil can be effective in the treatment of lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants.
Beneficial effects of angiotensin II inhibition during inflammatory renal disease may involve both hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic mechanisms. To analyze whether angiotensin II inhibition has protective effects on lupus-like, autoimmune-mediated renal damage in MRL/lpr mice, four groups of mice were treated orally for 6 weeks with: 1) vehicle, 2) enalapril (3.0 mg/kg per day), 3) candesartan cilexetil (5.0 mg/kg), or 4) amlodipine (10 mg/kg) as a blood pressure control (n = 9-12/group). All antihypertensive treatments lowered blood pressure to a similar level compared with vehicle group (enalapril: 99.8 +/- 8.3 mm Hg; candesartan: 101 +/- 9 mm Hg; amlodipine: 103.8 +/- 6.7 mm Hg; vehicle: 113.5 +/- 4.6 mm Hg). Vehicle-treated mice developed a moderate glomerular injury with albuminuria (35.1 +/- 39.0 microg/mg of creatinine). Glomerular lesions consisted of immune complex deposition and mesangial expansion with increased mesangial cell proliferation. Amlodipine treatment had no significant protective effects. In contrast to vehicle- and amlodipine-treated mice, those subjected to angiotensin II blockade with enalapril or candesartan had reduced albuminuria, glomerular expansion, and mesangial proliferation. This was associated with significantly reduced renal chemokine mRNA expression compared with vehicle treatment. Our results show that inhibition of angiotensin II has protective effects on the glomerular damage of MRL/lpr mice that extend beyond hemodynamics and involve down-modulation of glomerular inflammation, reduction of mesangial cell proliferation, and decrease in chemokine expression.
Increased adrenergic drive is a major factor influencing the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, a stage which precedes overt heart failure. We examined the effect of resveratrol, a polyphenol (found predominantly in grapes), in preventing norepinephrine induced hypertrophy of adult cardiomyocyte, and the role of nitric oxide (NO) and adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) in the effects of resveratrol. Cardiomyocytes isolated from adult rats were pretreated, or not, with resveratrol and then exposed to norepinephrine for 24h. In other experiments cardiomyocytes were also treated with different pharmacological inhibitors of NO synthase, AMPK and sirtuin for elucidating the signaling pathways underlying the effect of resveratrol. In order to validate the role of these signaling molecules in the in vivo settings, we also examined hearts from resveratrol treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), a genetic model of essential hypertension. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was determined by morphometry and (3)H-phenylalanine incorporation assay. NO levels and AMPK activity were measured using a specific assay kit and western blot analysis respectively. In vitro, resveratrol prevented the norepinephrine-induced increase in cardiomyocytes size and protein synthesis. Pharmacological inhibition of NO-AMPK signaling abolished the anti-hypertrophic action of resveratrol. Consistent with the in vitro findings, the anti-hypertrophic effect of resveratrol in the SHR model was associated with increases in NO and AMPK activity. This study demonstrates that NO-AMPK signaling is linked to the anti-hypertrophic effect of resveratrol in adult cardiomyocytes in vitro, and in the SHR model in vivo.
Binding of spiperone and 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), both labeled with hydrogen 3 (3H), were measured in caudate tissue obtained from 8 living parkinsonian patients at the time of cerebral transplantation. This was clinically homogeneous group of patients. All remained predominantly responsive to levodopa, although with marked disability secondary to clinical fluctuations (short-duration responses) and medication-induced dyskinesias; all were receiving substantial doses of levodopa and 6 of the 8 patients were additionally receiving bromocriptine or pergolide. Binding densities of dopamine D2 receptors, as measured by [3H]spiperone binding, were reduced in this group of patients, compared to caudate specimens from autopsy control subjects. This findings may reflect medication-induced receptor downregulation. Parallel changes occurred with muscarinic cholinergic receptors; [3H]QNB binding was significantly reduced, compared to autopsy control values. This reduction of muscarinic receptors might be due to loss of nigrostriatal terminals that are known to contain muscarinic receptors. Alternatively, muscarinic receptors may have been downregulated by increased corticostriatal glutamatergic input to cholinergic cells, inferred to be present based on the prominent levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Finally, receptor deficits could have been a reflection of more widespread degenerative cerebral disease, although levodopa-refractory symptoms were generally not pronounced in these patients.
Odontogenic keratocysts in humans are aggressive, noninflammatory jaw cysts that may harbor PTCH1 mutations, leading to constitutive activity of the embryonic Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. We show here that epithelial expression of the Hh transcriptional effector Gli2 is sufficient for highly penetrant keratocyst development in transgenic mice. Mouse and human keratocysts expressed similar markers, leading to tooth misalignment, bone remodeling, and craniofacial abnormalities. We detected Hh target gene expression in epithelial cells lining keratocysts from both species, implicating deregulated Hh signaling in their development. Most mouse keratocysts arose from rests of Malassez--quiescent, residual embryonic epithelial cells that remain embedded in the periodontal ligament surrounding mature teeth. In Gli2-expressing mice, these rests were stimulated to proliferate, stratify, and form a differentiated squamous epithelium. The frequent development of keratocysts in Gli2-expressing mice supports the idea that GLI transcription factor activity mediates pathological responses to deregulated Hh signaling in humans. Moreover, Gli2-mediated reactivation of quiescent epithelial rests to form keratocysts indicates that these cells retain the capacity to function as progenitor cells on activation by an appropriate developmental signal.
We report a case involving a 45-year-old man with a 12-year history of Wegener granulomatosis, who developed a carcinosarcoma of the urinary bladder after long-term cyclophosphamide therapy. Cyclophosphamide is well recognized as an etiologic agent for urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder. However, only 5 cases of carcinosarcoma of the urinary bladder following cyclophosphamide therapy have been reported. We used loss of heterozygosity studies and microsatellite markers to define the molecular basis of this rare neoplasm. These studies revealed evidence supporting a monoclonal origin for the 2 components of this tumor. We also demonstrated allelic loss of chromosome 9p. This loss associated with carcinosarcoma of the urinary bladder is in agreement with previous studies, suggesting a possible role for the tumor suppressor gene p16 in the pathogenesis of this tumor.
Sixteen patients underwent electrophysiologic studies before and after intravenous infusion of propranolol, 0.1 mg/kg. All of them had intraventricular conduction disturbances. A significant (p less than 0.01) increase occurred after propranolol in the mean spontaneous cycle length (mean change 122 ms) and the AH interval (mean 28 ms). The HV interval did not change significantly. The effective refractory period of the His-Purkinje system increased in 4 of 5 patients (mean net change 44 ms, p greater than 0.10). In 7 patients with phase 3 infranodal block, the longest cycle length for producing block increased after propranolol in 5 and remained unchanged in 2 (mean increase 40 ms, p less than 0.02). Two patients showed phase 4 atrioventricular block. Propranolol increased the critical cycle length by an average of 120 ms. Propranolol-induced bradycardia restored stable atrioventricular conduction in 2 patients with intermittent 2:1 block but facilitated the occurrence of high grade infranodal block in 1 patient. Thus, propranolol can impair His-Purkinje conduction in patients with preexisting infranodal abnormalities.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of daily laser irradiation on the levels of amino acid neurotransmitters in the cortex and hippocampus in an epileptic animal model induced by pilocarpine.
It has been claimed that at specific wavelengths and energy densities, laser irradiation is a novel and useful tool for the treatment of peripheral and central nervous system injuries and disorders.
Adult male albino rats were divided into three groups: control rats, pilocarpinized rats (epileptic animal model), and pilocarpinized rats treated daily with laser irradiation (90 mW at 830 nm) for 7 d. The following parameters were assayed in cortex and hippocampus: amino acid neurotransmitters (excitatory: glutamic acid and aspartate; and inhibitory: gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA], glycine, and taurine) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), glucose content, and the activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), using a spectrophotometer.
Significant increases in the concentrations of glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, and taurine were recorded in the cortices of pilocarpinized rats, and they returned to initial levels after laser treatment. In the hippocampus, a moderate increase in aspartate accompanied by a significant increase in glycine were observed in the epileptic animal model, and these dropped to near-control values after laser treatment. In addition, a significant increase in cortical AST activity and a significant decrease in ALT activity and glucose content were obtained in the pilocarpinized animals and pilocarpinized rats treated with laser irradiation. In the hippocampus, significant decreases in the activity of AST and ALT and glucose content were recorded in the epileptic animals and in the epileptic animals treated with laser irradiation.
Based on the results obtained in this study, it may be suggested that nearinfrared laser irradiation may reverse the neurochemical changes in amino acid neurotransmitters induced by pilocarpine.
Because of genetic heterogeneity, the identification of breast cancer-susceptibility genes has proven to be exceedingly difficult. Here, we define a new subset of families with breast cancer characterized by the presence of colorectal cancer cases. The 1100delC variant of the cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHEK2 gene was present in 18% of 55 families with hereditary breast and colorectal cancer (HBCC) as compared with 4% of 380 families with non-HBCC (P<.001), thus providing genetic evidence for the HBCC phenotype. The CHEK2 1100delC mutation was, however, not the major predisposing factor for the HBCC phenotype but appeared to act in synergy with another, as-yet-unknown susceptibility gene(s). The unequivocal definition of the HBCC phenotype opens new avenues to search for this putative HBCC-susceptibility gene.
Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat. Classic analgesics (i.e., opioid receptor agonists) usually possess low activity. Therefore other agents such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and corticosteroids are used. It is commonly known that NMDA antagonists increase analgesic activity of opioids. Unfortunately, clinical use of NMDA antagonists is limited because of the relatively frequent occurrence of adverse effects e.g., memory impairment, psychomimetic effects, ataxia and motor in-coordination. Magnesium ions (Mg(2+)) are NMDA receptor blockers in physiological conditions. Therefore, in this study the effect of opioid receptor agonists and the influence of Mg(2+) on the action of opioid agonists in vincristine-induced hyperalgesia were examined. Opioid agonists such as morphine (5 mg/kg, ip), and fentanyl (0.0625 mg/kg, ip), as well as the partial agonist buprenorphine (0.075 mg/kg, ip) administered alone on 5 consecutives days did not modify the hyperalgesia in vincristine rats. In contrast, pretreatment with a low dose of magnesium sulfate (30 mg/kg, ip) resulted in a progressive increase of the analgesic action of all three investigated opioids. After discontinuation of drug administration, the effect persisted for several days.
Despite the widespread use of meperidine as an analgesic, its potential for producing delirium has been overlooked. Six cases demonstrating meperidine-induced behavioral toxicity are reported. Toxicity was more likely when meperidine was combined with cimetidine or drugs having anticholinergic activity. Discontinuation of meperidine and substitution of morphine for analgesia were usually successful in treating the delirium. Physostigmine reversed the delirium in one patient. The authors suggest that the delirium results from the excessive anticholinergic activity of meperidine or its only active metabolite, normeperidine.
Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE) is an uncommon cutaneous complication of cytotoxic chemotherapy which generally presents as a painful erythema involving the palms and soles. It has been suggested that PPE caused by cytarabine does not recur with subsequent cytarabine re-challenge. We report a patient with recurrent, increasingly severe episodes of PPE, ultimately complicated by a severe bullous eruption, following successive cycles of high-dose cytarabine for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Contrary to previous recommendations, our experience cautions against the further use of high-dose cytarabine in patients who develop PPE, and is a timely reminder of the potential toxicity of this agent, which is now increasingly being used as first-line treatment in the management of haematologic malignancies.
Dexrazoxane (DZR) protects against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in several laboratory animal species and in patients with breast cancer. Encouraging results have also been obtained in a limited number of pediatric oncology patients. We conducted studies to determine the safety and cardioprotective activity of DZR in the doxorubicin (DOX)-treated weanling rat simulating the rapidly growing immature child.
Male weanling rats and young adult rats, 20 days old and 7 weeks old, respectively, were given 1 mg/kg DOX i.v., either alone or with 20 mg/kg DZR, once weekly for 7 weeks. Rats were sacrificed at weeks 8, 12 or 26 following blood collection for hematology and serum chemistry. Hearts were weighed and examined histologically.
DOX, either alone or with DZR, inhibited growth, and body weight remained below that of controls throughout the 26 weeks of study. There were no biologically significant hematologic changes in either the DOX- or DZR + DOX-treated young rats. DOX caused a slight increase in liver and kidney weights relative to body weight and a slight increase in serum cholesterol and triglycerides in the young rats. These effects were ameliorated or delayed by DZR. DOX, either alone or with DZR, caused a marked atrophy of the testes in the young rats which had recovered by week 26. In the mature rats, DOX caused a significant decrease in the WBC 1 week after the last treatment, and the WBC was significantly lower in the rats given DZR + DOX compared to those given DOX alone. There were marked increases in liver and kidney weight, serum cholesterol and triglycerides in the mature rats given DOX alone but not in those given DZR + DOX. There was also a marked testicular atrophy in the mature rats given either DOX or DZR + DOX but, unlike that observed in the young rats, this had not returned to normal by week 26. DOX-induced cardiotoxicity was less severe in the younger rats than in the mature rats but in both age groups, the lesion progressed rapidly until week 12, 5 weeks after the last dose, and remained relatively stable or progressed slightly thereafter. DZR provided significant cardioprotection in both age groups at all time points examined. Moreover, in both age groups, the severity of the cardiomyopathy in the DZR-treated rats was somewhat less at week 26 than it was at week 12.
The results indicate that the pharmacologic effects of DZR, including its ability to protect against cardiotoxicity, are similar in immature and adult male animals treated with DOX.
It has recently been shown that the specific and selective alpha 2-antagonist idazoxan (IDZ) displays prolactin-lowering activity on hyperprolactinemia induced in the rat either by suckling or serotonergic drugs. In an attempt better to understand the role of alpha 2-adrenoceptors under the above conditions, experiments were carried out to compare the effects of IDZ with that of the classic alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine (YOH), and also of the alpha 2-agonists clonidine (CLO) and B-HT 920, on prolactin (PRL) release during lactation and in hyperprolactinemia induced in male rats by the serotonergic drug fenfluramine (FEN). In lactating rats, both alpha 2-agonists decreased PRL release; this effect was enhanced by prior separation of the animals from their pups for several hours. A decrease of plasma PRL levels was also induced by IDZ but not by YOH, which tended further to increase hyperprolactinemia. In male rats treated with FEN, IDZ and CLO, a significant decrease of plasma PRL was produced, but YOH further enhanced PRL secretion. It is concluded that the alpha 2-agonists tested and also the alpha 2-antagonist IDZ display a unique inhibitory activity on PRL release during suckling or serotonergic-induced hyperprolactinemia.
Myocardial ischemia induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a relatively rare, but potentially serious, occurrence. Some case reports have indicated that recurrent ischemia may be prevented if 5-FU is resumed after pretreatment with antianginal therapy.
A 54-year old woman was diagnosed with stage IIA squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. Treatment with concurrent radiation and chemotherapy (mitomycin-C and 5-FU) was initiated with curative intent.
The patient had no evidence of underlying coronary artery disease based on history, physical examination or ECG. Approximately 48 h after initiation of 5-FU infusion the patient developed anginal pain associated with ECG changes compatible with ischemia. After resolution of ischemia and ruling out of myocardial infarction, coronary arteriography demonstrated normal coronary arteries. In an attempt to prevent myocardial ischemia, calcium channel blocker and nitrate therapy was started, but anginal pain with ECG change recurred when 5-FU was resumed. This necessitated selection of an alternative chemotherapy regimen.
Even in the presence of normal coronary arteries, antianginal therapy may not preclude the occurrence of potentially serious 5-FU induced myocardial ischemia. For patients who experience 5-FU-induced myocardial ischemia, development of alternative chemotherapy regimens should be considered.
Potential modifying effects of epoprostenol sodium administration on liver carcinogenesis were investigated in male F344/DuCrj rats initially treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN). Two weeks after a single dose of DEN (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), rats daily received subcutaneously epoprostenol sodium at doses of 0, 1, 10 and 100 microg/kg, or were fed phenobarbital sodium (PB) at a dietary level of 500 parts per million (ppm) as positive control for 6 weeks. All animals were subjected to partial hepatectomy at week 3, and were killed at week 8. Prominent flushing of extremis and signs of behavioural depression occurred after injection and lasted for 1 h in rats given 100 microg/kg epoprostenol sodium. Such clinical signs were slight in rats treated with 10 microg/kg, but not observed with 1 microg/kg. Marked decrease in body weight gain was noted in rats given 100 microg/kg. Statistically significant changes in relative liver weights were not found in any group given the test chemical. Epoprostenol sodium did not significantly increase the quantitative values for glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive liver cell foci observed after DEN initiation, in clear contrast to the positive control. The results thus demonstrate that epoprostenol sodium lacks modifying potential for liver carcinogenesis in our medium-term bioassay system.
