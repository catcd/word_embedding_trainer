Lymphocele is a special complication following kidney transplantation. The authors examined the factors associated with an increased occurrence of clinically significant perinephric fluid collections and/or lymphoceles among sirolimus-treated renal transplant recipients.
From the point of view of the lymphocele a comparison was made for the risks and benefits of the conventional and a newer immunosuppressive combination.
At the University of Texas in Houston in a retrospective study the incidence, predisposing factors, and consequences of these fluid collections among patients treated with sirolimus-cyclosporine-prednisone ( n = 354, Group I) versus cyclosporine-prednisone-azathioprine ( n = 136, Group II) were compared.
More Group I patients (135/354; 38.1%) displayed perinephric fluid collections than Group II patients (24/136; 17.6%; p < 0.001). In both subgroups the serum creatinine levels were elevated at the time of diagnosis from a nadir of 179.5 +/- 141.7 to 359.9 +/- 259.6 mmol/l (Group III, sirolimus treated) and from 222.6 +/- 205.9 to 383.7 +/- 255.2 mmol/l (Group IV, sirolimus free). A significantly greater number of patients required treatment for lymphoceles among Group I (15.8%; 56/354) versus Group II recipients (4.4%; 6/136; p < 0.001). Single or repeated percutaneous drainage procedures successfully treated 35 Group I patients versus all 6 Group IV patients ( p = 0.033). No patients in Group II versus 21 patients in Group I underwent surgical procedures ( p < 0.001). A significantly higher rate and higher histologic grade of acute rejection episodes, particularly proximate to the onset of the lymphocele, occurred among Group IV patients, namely 54.2% (13/24) versus 21.4% (29/135) Group III patients ( p < 0.001). Additionally we report the case of a 29-year-old patient who underwent a lymphocele fenestration with omentoplasty 8 years after his transplantation. Despite an Influenza A + Chlamydia pneumonia and acute rejection which was followed by a GI bleeding and stomach resection he fully recovered and is doing well with an excellent kidney function a year after.
Addition of sirolimus to a cyclosporine-prednisone regimen resulted in both a higher incidence and a requirement for more aggressive treatment of perinephric fluid collections and/or lymphoceles with a much lower acute rejection frequency.
Pulmonary manifestations are not infrequent in the L-tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS). However, previous reports have not described the results of longitudinal pulmonary function, exercise testing, high-resolution computerized tomographic (HRCT) scanning of the chest, or detailed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis. We report six patients with EMS who had dyspnea. The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was decreased in five patients tested. Exercise testing with arterial blood gas sampling in three patients was consistent with pulmonary vascular or parenchymal disease. Serial exercise testing in two of these patients demonstrated marked improvement temporally associated with corticosteroid treatment. In four patients, HRCT scanning of the chest was abnormal. One of these patients showed no abnormality on routine chest roentgenogram. Two patients undergoing BAL exhibited increased eosinophils in the lavage fluid; a third had elevated lymphocytes. Serial measurements of fibroblast proliferation-stimulating-activity in samples of BAL fluid obtained from serial examinations in two patients exhibited heightened pretreatment activity that returned to the normal range following corticosteroid therapy. In these two patients, increased proportions of T-suppressor/cytolytic (CD8+) cells were observed in the BAL fluid. Despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, one of the patients died of respiratory failure. Another remains markedly dyspneic with pulmonary hypertension. Of the remaining four patients, two exhibited resolution of pulmonary symptoms after systemic corticosteroid therapy, and two experienced partial improvement.
Fluticasone propionate (FP) is a topical corticosteroid with minimal systemic activity. We examined safety and compared the efficacy of FP aqueous nasal spray, 200 micrograms every day with loratadine tablets, 10 mg by mouth every day in 240 adolescents with ragweed pollen-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis for 4 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Nasal and eye symptoms were recorded daily on a 4-point (0 to 3) scale. A higher percentage of symptom-free days was observed for nasal blockage on waking during treatment with FP (p < 0.0001). Significant results were also obtained for all other nasal symptoms when analyzed for both symptom-free days and symptom scores. No differences were found for eye irritation symptoms (p = 0.14). Morning and evening nasal peak inspiratory flow (PIF) was recorded daily by 57 subjects. FP treatment was associated wit significantly higher PIF values than loratadine both morning (p = 0.0051) and evening (p = 0.0036). A greater improvement over 4 weeks was observed for PIF morning values in the FP group (p = 0.008) but not for evening values (p = 0.358). Statistically significant correlations were found for nasal blockage and PIF in the morning (r = -0.54, p = 0.0001) and in the evening (r = -0.46, p = 0.008).
We evaluated the acute hemodynamic responses to hydralazine during cardiac catheterization in 13 infants with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Ages ranged from 2 to 13 months (6.7 +/- 4.0 months, mean +/- SD). Each infant had congestive heart failure and angiographic evidence of markedly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (0.24 +/- 0.11; normal = 0.58-0.78) with left ventricular dilation (left ventricular end-diastolic volume = 349 +/- 125% of normal). Hydralazine (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg administered intravenously) acutely decreased systemic arteriolar resistance from 21.1 +/- 3.3 to 12.0 +/- 2.7 U/m2 (p less than 0.001). This 41 +/- 14% decrease in systemic resistance was accompanied by a 45 +/- 16% increase in cardiac index (3.24 +/- 0.53 to 4.71 +/- 0.99 L/min/m2; p less than 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure declined from 70 +/- 8 to 60 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Hydralazine also increased heart rate (122 +/- 19 to 138 +/- 18 bpm; p less than 0.001), but this increase did not account entirely for the change in cardiac index as evidenced by a rise in stroke volume index (26.9 +/- 4.9 to 34.5 +/- 7.5 ml/beat/m2; p less than 0.001). Pulmonary arteriolar resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure fell slightly in response to hydralazine. Subsequently, oral hydralazine was included in the treatment regimen of 10 infants followed for 3 to 38 months (mean = 15 months). Of these, eight demonstrated sustained clinical improvement. We conclude that hydralazine may be a beneficial adjunct to the management of congestive heart failure in young infants with a dilated cardiomyopathy.
Most human cancer cells have structural aberrations of chromosomal regions leading to loss or gain of gene specific alleles. This study aimed to assess the range of gene copies per nucleus of thymidylate synthase (TYMS), thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in colorectal cancer, and to evaluate its prognostic significance following adjuvant chemotherapy, since these enzymes are closely related to efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5FU).
Consecutive patients (n = 314), who were completely resected for colorectal cancer stages II-IV and adjuvantly treated with 5-FU were retrospectively evaluated. Paraffin embedded tumor specimens were assessed for gene copies per nucleus of TYMS, TP and DHFR by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using specific peptide nucleic acid probes. Outcome according to gene copies per nucleus above and below the median were compared. Also TYMS expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry, was associated with TYMS copies per nucleus.
The number of gene copies per nucleus were 1.7 (0.7-2.8), 1.8 (0.9-3.1) and 1.8 (1.1-2.7) median (range) for TYMS, TP and DHFR, respectively. TYMS expression was directly associated with TYMS genes per nucleus (p = 0.05). Cox multivariate analysis, adjusted for the prognostic impact of disease stage, vascular tumor invasion, and bowel obstruction at resection, revealed that high TYMS gene copy number was associated with significantly higher risk of recurrence (HR = 1.6; 95%CI 1.1-2.2; p = 0.02) and death (HR = 1.6; 95%CI 1.1-2.3; p = 0.01). No significant differences in outcome appeared according to TP and DHFR gene ratios.
Aberration of TYMS gene is of significance to expression of TYMS, which may influence the biology and 5-FU sensitivity of colorectal cancer. This may be utilized in the allocation of patients for treatment approaches and for decision on follow-up programs.
A 35-year-old woman developed acute intravascular hemolysis within five days of beginning a course of ceftazidime. The direct antiglobulin test became strongly positive with both anti-IgG and anticomplement. The serum contained an antibody that, in the presence of ceftazidime, sensitized unmodified reagent cells with IgG and complement (immune-complex type). The serum also agglutinated ceftazidime-pretreated cells at room temperature and 37 degrees C (drug-adsorption type). Retrospective testing disclosed that the drug adsorption antibody, which had been present before the current course of antibiotics, was not demonstrable during the hemolysis. The reactivity of the immune complex antibody, which developed by the second day of ceftazidime, paralleled the degree of hemolysis and the strength of the direct antiglobulin test. The authors believe that this patient had two separate ceftazidime-dependent antibodies and that the antibody reactive by immune complex mechanism mediated an episode of acute intravascular hemolysis.
In order to analyze the genetics of susceptibility to promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis in DBA/2NCr and C57BL/6NCr mice by phenobarbital (PB), reciprocal F1 hybrid male mice were given 90 mg N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA)/kg body weight, i.p. at 5 weeks of age followed by 0.05% PB in drinking water. Hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were comparably increased in incidence and multiplicity in both reciprocal hybrids over mice given NDEA alone. Eight of 10 D2B6F1 progeny of DBA/2NCr females mated with C57BL/6NCr males, but only 1/10 B6D2F1 mice (progeny of C57BL/6NCr females mated with DBA/2NCr males) given PB after NDEA initiation developed single or multiple hepatoblastomas within 42 weeks. These small-celled, intensely basophilic tumors were characteristically hemorrhagic and highly malignant. Hepatoblastomas were mostly found within or adjacent to hepatocellular tumors. No hepatoblastomas were seen in either hybrid given NDEA alone. PB consistently enhanced development of malignant hepatoblastomas, as well as promoted hepatocarcinogenesis in D2B6F1 males, but did not elicit hepatoblastoma development in B6D2F1 males that were genetically identical to D2B6F1 males except for the reverse origin of their X and Y chromosomes.
The black widow spider (BWS), which is a member of the arthropod family, is widely distributed on earth. Black widow spider bites can cause a wide variety of signs or symptoms in humans, but the cardiovascular manifestations are relatively rare except hypertension/hypotension and bradycardia/tachycardia. We report on a 65-year-old man who experienced myocarditis after BWS envenomation, which is extremely rare. He complained of chest pain after the BWS bite, and electrocardiography (ECG) was consistent with a 0.5-mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, aVF, and V3 through V6 and accompanying augmentation in T-wave amplitude in leads V3 through V6 without reciprocal changes. Creatine kinase-MB, troponin-I, and aspartate aminotransferase levels peaked at 98 IU/L, 6.1 ng/mL, and 62 U/L, respectively. His ECG readings and cardiac enzymes returned to normal with supportive treatment, and he was discharged with complete recovery. To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the third in the literature reporting myocarditis and the first reporting ST-segment elevation and accompanying augmentation in T-wave amplitude after BWS envenomation. In addition to usual measures, we recommend ECG and cardiac-specific enzyme followup for every patient envenomated by BWS for potentially fatal cardiac involvement.
T cells of autoimmune-prone mice homozygous for the lpr mutation respond poorly to mitogens in terms of proliferation and of IL-2 production. In a previous study, we have correlated this deficient activation with the inability of mitogens to stimulate hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in lpr T cells, although these cells bind mitogen and express the TCR/CD3 complex. In order to determine whether activation-deficient lpr T cells contain functional GTP-binding (G) protein(s) and phospholipase C, we examined the effects of the G protein activating agent sodium fluoride plus Al+3 (AlF-4). AlF-4 stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover, a response characteristic of TCR/CD3 occupancy, in mature L3T4+ and Ly2+ T cells. Second, and more important, AlF-4 stimulated the same biochemical events in L3T4-, Ly2- (double-negative) T cells from the normal thymus or from the enlarged lymph nodes of autoimmune-prone mice homozygous for the lpr mutation. However, these double-negative T cells were unresponsive to receptor-active ligands such as T cell mitogens or anti-CD3-epsilon mAb, despite their ability to bind these ligands. These findings suggest that activation-deficient double negative T cells express the receptors, G protein(s) and effector enzymes necessary for second messenger formation and further suggest that the failure of these cells to generate the relevant second messengers in response to mitogens or anti-CD3-epsilon antibody may be due to inefficient coupling of the TCR/CD3 complex to G proteins.
Although L-arginine is the only substrate for nitric oxide (NO) production, no studies have yet been reported on the effect of an L-arginine deficiency on vascular function in humans. Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is a rare autosomal recessive defect of dibasic amino acid transport caused by mutations in the SLC7A7 gene, resulting in an L-arginine deficiency. Vascular endothelial function was examined in an LPI patient who was shown to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in the gene (5.3-kbp Alu-mediated deletion, IVS3+1G-->A). The lumen diameter of the brachial artery was measured in this patient and in healthy controls at rest, during reactive hyperemia (endothelium-dependent vasodilation [EDV]), and after sublingual nitroglycerin administration (endothelium-independent vasodilation [EIV]) using ultrasonography. Both EDV and NO(x) concentrations were markedly reduced in the patient compared with those for the controls. They became normal after an L-arginine infusion. EIV was not significantly different between the patient and controls. Positron emission tomography of the heart and a treadmill test revealed ischemic changes in the patient, which were improved by the L-arginine infusion. Thus, in the LPI patient, L-arginine deficiency caused vascular endothelial dysfunction via a decrease in NO production.
The inability to appropriately ventilate neonates shortly after their birth could be related in rare cases to chest-wall rigidity caused by the placental transfer of fentanyl. Although this adverse effect is recognized when fentanyl is administered to neonates after their birth, the prenatal phenomenon is less known. Treatment with either naloxone or muscle relaxants reverses the fentanyl effect and may prevent unnecessary excessive ventilatory settings.
Mangiferin, from the leaves of Mangifera indica Linn., has been suggested as useful in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. In the present study this drug was examined on the alteration of cardiac energy metabolism in isoproterenol (ISPH) administered myocardial infarcted rats. ISPH (20 mg/kg b.w.), which was administered s.c. twice at an interval of 24 h, caused a significant decrease in the activities of TCA cycle enzymes and antioxidant defense enzymes with a concomitant increase in the lipid peroxidation of heart mitochondria in rat model. The ATP production and the oxidation of succinate in State 3 and 4 decreased significantly in the cardiac mitochondria of ISPH administered rats. These functional alterations were supported by severe modifications in mitochondrial ultrastructure. Pretreatment with mangiferin (100 mg/kg b.w. i.p.) for 28 days prevented these mitochondrial alterations, oxidation with energy metabolism and restored the TCA cycle enzyme activities to near normal values following ISPH administration. The structural integrity of the heart was protected by mangiferin in ISPH administered rats when compared to the untreated controls. The present findings suggest that the protective effect of mangiferin can be attributed to its reducing effect on oxidative damage and activation of mitochondrial energy metabolism. These results could be useful to study and understand the cellular events involved in this cardioprotective mechanism of mangiferin. Our studies of mangiferin on heart failure may have important implication for future therapeutic approaches involving in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
The authors studied 200 cases of systemic lupus erythematosus. In most of the patients (117 cases) they exhibited neurasthenic symptoms and somato-psychic adynamia. In 3 cases there was a hallucinatory syndrome and in 2 - a hallucinatory-paranoid psychosis. The pathomorphological findings depicted organic brain lesions (vasculitis). A supplementary factor promoting mental disturbances in some cases could be an overdosage of corticosteroids and kidney lesions.
We have investigated alterations in adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activity in cardiac membranes from rats injected with 40 mg/kg intraperitoneal isoproterenol. Reduction in the number of beta-adrenergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors, as assessed by changes in specific binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and 3H-dihydroergocryptine (DHE), was observed only at 9 and 24 hours after isoproterenol injection, respectively. On the other hand, epinephrine-stimulated, NaF-stimulated, and Gpp (NH)p-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was decreased as early as 3 hours after isoproterenol treatment without changes in the basal adenylate cyclase activity. These results demonstrate a defect in the adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system during the development of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy and may partly explain the attenuated inotropic adrenergic response of the heart under stressful situations.
Osteopetrosis is a congenital metabolic bone disease characterized by skeletal sclerosis resulting from defective osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The disease may, inter alia, be caused by the administration of bisphosphonates (e.g. pamidronate) particularly in young humans. The issue of the effect of pamindronate-induced osteopetrosis on the function of blood circulation and autonomic nervous system remains open. In order to clarify this problem, the present study concentrated on the effect of catecholamines on blood pressure in the marrow cavity in rats with pamindronate-induced osteopetrosis. The experiments consisted in pamidronate administration to young male Wistar rats at doses of 3 mg/kg sc, for 3 or 6 weeks. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoprenaline as well as adrenoceptor antagonists (phentolamine and propranolol) were administered to the controls and the rats with pamindronate-induced osteopetrosis. The examinations demonstrated that rats with pamidronate-induced osteopetrosis displayed increased blood pressure in the marrow cavity. In addition, a disorder in the effect of catecholamines on blood pressure in the marrow cavity of osteopetrotic bone was observed.
The potential teratogenic effects and fetal toxicity of environmental estrogenic endocrine disruptors have become a great concern in recent years, and they have yet to be fully characterized. In the present study, the teratogenic effects of bisphenol A (BPA) and genistein (GEN) on rat embryos during their critical period of organogenesis were investigated using a whole-embryo culture experiment. The combined exposure effects of BPA and GEN were explored using a 4 x 4 full factorial design. Both BPA and GEN produced concentration-dependent inhibition of embryonic development, beginning at 32.0 and 10.0 microg/ml, respectively. Full factorial and isobologram analyses revealed a significant synergistic interaction between BPA and GEN for most end points (12 out of 20 tested), as indicated by the enhanced developmental toxicity of BPA after coexposure with different dose levels of GEN. In particular, serious malformations and a higher abnormal frequency of the central nervous system were induced by the combination of BPA and GEN. Our findings suggest that GEN may be embryotoxic and teratogenic to humans. BPA alone may not be a potential teratogen, but these two estrogenic chemicals have a synergistic effect on embryonic development when present together during the critical period of major organ formation. The current findings suggest that pregnant women should not take soy supplements, but more studies are necessary to provide a conclusive recommendation.
Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses (IVMP) are more efficacious and better tolerated than oral prednisone in Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) patients. However, acute and severe liver damage has been reported in sporadic cases during IVMP, resulting in fatal acute liver failure in four patients so far. The mechanism causing the liver damage is incompletely understood.
We performed a prospective observational study in 13 patients with dysthyroid optic neuropathy (group A) and in 14 patients with moderately severe GO (group B) who were treated with high-dose (group A) or low-dose (group B) IVMP; cumulative steroid doses were 8.45 g in group A and 4.5 g in group B, and follow-up time was 24 weeks.
Slight increases in serum aminotransferases (in alanine aminotransferase [ALAT] more than in aspartate aminotransferase [ASAT]) were observed, in seven patients exceeding the upper normal limit of 40 U/L. These changes were more prominent in group A than in group B as was also evident from a decrease in ASAT/ALAT ratio in group A but not in group B. Changes in serum aminotransferases occurred especially in the first 6 weeks of IVMP, becoming smaller thereafter with the decrease in steroid dosage. Pretreatment liver steatosis or diabetes were not related to liver damage, but preexistent viral hepatitis was.
IVMP in GO patients causes dose-dependent liver damage by a direct toxic effect of glucocorticoids on hepatocytes. Nevertheless, IVMP seems to be pretty safe if cumulative doses exceeding 8 g are avoided and liver function is checked before and at regular intervals during pulse therapy.
The effect of pentoxifylline (PTX) on acute liver injury caused by CCl4 or acetaminophen was studied in the rat. PTX was given twice daily (18, 36 or 72 mg/kg), intraperitoneally (ip) for 5 days prior to CCl4 or acetaminophen. In addition, the effect of PTX administered simultaneously with CCl4 or acetaminophen was evaluated. Rats were killed 72 h or 48 h after CCl4 or acetaminophen administration, respectively. The administration of PTX at 72 mg/kg, conferred significant protection against the hepatotoxic actions of CCl4, reducing serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels to 31%, 59.2% and 63%, respectively. Histological examination showed a decrease in centrilobular necrotic areas in rats pretreated with PTX. Histochemical investigation revealed a decrease in glycogen and protein contents caused by CCl4 and these were prevented by PTX pretreatment. When administered with CCl4, PTX did not reduce CCl4-induced hepatic injury. In contrast, hepatic injury induced by acetaminophen was prevented by prior or co-treatment with PTX. Accordingly, with 72 mg/kg of PTX, the elevation of AST, ALT and ALP levels was lower by 45%, 80.6%, 54.3% for the former and by 32.4%, 77.2%, 52.4% for the latter, respectively. Stained sections were subjected to morphometric evaluation using computerized image analyzer. Quantitative analysis of the acetaminophen area of damage showed a reduction by 34.8, 65.5 and 89.2% by 18, 36 or 72 mg/kg for PTX, respectively. Rats treated with PTX revealed more or less normal hepatocyte architecture as well as marked improvement in protein and glycogen content. The study demonstrates that prior but not co-toxicant administration of PTX in a model of CCl4-induced liver injury results in less liver damage. In contrast, PTX is equally protective, when given either as a pretreatment or with acetaminophen exposure.
During pregnancy, the demand for folic acid increases since the fetus requires this nutrient for its rapid growth and cell proliferation. The placenta concentrates folic acid into the fetal circulation; as a result the fetal levels are 2 to 4 times higher than the maternal level. Animal and in vitro studies have suggested that alcohol may impair transport of folic acid across the placenta by decreasing expression of transport proteins. We aim to determine if folate transfer to the fetus is altered in human pregnancies with chronic alcohol consumption.
Serum folate was measured in maternal blood and umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery in pregnancies with chronic and heavy alcohol exposure (n = 23) and in non-drinking controls (n = 24). In the alcohol-exposed pairs, the fetal:maternal serum folate ratio was ≤ 1.0 in over half (n = 14), whereas all but one of the controls were >1.0. Mean folate in cord samples was lower in the alcohol-exposed group than in the controls (33.15 ± 19.89 vs 45.91 ± 20.73, p = 0.04).
Our results demonstrate that chronic and heavy alcohol use in pregnancy impairs folate transport to the fetus. Altered folate concentrations within the placenta and in the fetus may in part contribute to the deficits observed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
The demonstration that one of the mechanisms of action of bisphosphonates (BPs) is the induction of osteoclast and macrophage apoptosis, suggests a potent therapeutic role for the BPs and other apoptosis-modulating agents in the management of periprosthetic osteolysis. The purpose of this study was to improve our understanding of the basic underlying molecular events leading to the inhibitory effect of pamidronate on the macrophage response to ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) particles. Murine J774 macrophages were incubated for 0-72 h in the presence of UHMWPE particles and/or pamidronate. TNF-alpha release was measured by ELISA while poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) expression was measured by Western blot. DNA was analyzed on agarose. The appearance of PARP fragment and the fragmentation of DNA were used as markers of apoptosis. We observed a dose-dependent response to UHMWPE particles with TNF-alpha release reaching 4, 10, and 19 times control with 10, 25, and 125 particles/macrophage, respectively. UHMWPE particles (25 particles/macrophage) stimulate TNF-alpha release by a factor of 10, 7, and 6 after 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively, indicating a rapid stimulating effect of UHMWPE particles on TNF-alpha release. Our results also showed that at 10 particles/macrophage, pamidronate inhibits UHMWPE-induced TNF-alpha release by 12%, 14%, and 23% respectively after 24, 48, and 72 h (p<0.05 vs. 24 and 48 h). With 25 particles/macrophage, the inhibition of TNF-alpha reached 9%, 12%, and 15% after 24, 48, and 72 h (p<0.05 vs. 24 h), respectively. There is no significant difference between the inhibition by pamidronate of TNF-alpha release induced by 125 particles/macrophages at 24, 48, and 72 h. When cells are pre-incubated for 48 h with pamidronate prior to addition of UHMWPE particles for 24 h, we observed an increased inhibition of TNF-alpha compared to the co-incubation protocol. The inhibiting effect of pamidronate reaches 56% when pre-incubated with macrophages prior to incubation with 10 particles of UHMWPE/macrophage (p<0.05 vs. co-incubation).Co-incubation of pamidronate with UHMWPE particles also led to the appearance of the proteolytic PARP fragment after 24 h incubation. We also demonstrated the stimulation of DNA fragmentation (DNA laddering) after 48-72 h with pamidronate. The proteolytic cleavage of PARP, an early event in the induction of apoptosis, precedes the inhibition of UHMWPE particle-induced TNF-alpha release by pamidronate whereas the fragmentation of DNA, a late apoptotic event, parallels this inhibition. Our results suggest the induction of macrophage apoptosis is associated with the inhibitory effect of pamidronate on TNF-alpha release. There is a need for the development of medical management of periprosthetic osteolysis. The demonstration that drugs such as pamidronate induce specific apoptosis-related pathways in macrophages contributes data for a rational approach in the treatment and/or prevention of periprosthetic osteolysis.
The potent anticonvulsant properties of neuropeptide Y (NPY) are generally attributed to a Y2 receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Independent studies have shown that NPY increases brain dopamine content, possibly via interaction with sigma 1 receptors. Recently, we showed that increased extracellular hippocampal dopamine attenuates pilocarpine-induced limbic seizures via activation of hippocampal D2 receptors. Our aim in this study was to elucidate the role of increased hippocampal dopamine in the mechanism of the anticonvulsant action of NPY and to investigate the involvement of Y2 and sigma 1 receptors in this process. Limbic seizures were evoked in freely moving rats by intrahippocampal administration of pilocarpine via a microdialysis probe. NPY was administered intracerebroventricularly, intrahippocampally via the microdialysis probe, or coadministered intrahippocampally with the D2 receptor antagonist remoxipride, the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 or the sigma 1 receptor antagonist BD1047. Changes in hippocampal extracellular dopamine were monitored, and behavioural changes indicative of seizure activity were scored. Intracerebroventricular (10 nmol/3 microL) and intrahippocampal (20-50 microm) NPY administration increased hippocampal dopamine and attenuated pilocarpine-induced seizures. Hippocampal D2 receptor blockade (4 microm remoxipride) reversed the anticonvulsant effect of NPY. Y2 receptor blockade (1 microm BIIE0246) reversed the anticonvulsant effect of NPY but did not prevent NPY-induced increases in hippocampal dopamine. Sigma 1 receptor blockade (10 microm BD1047) abolished NPY-induced increases in hippocampal dopamine and reversed the anticonvulsant effect of NPY. Our results indicate that NPY-induced increases in hippocampal dopamine are mediated via sigma 1 receptors and contribute to the anticonvulsant effect of NPY via increased activation of hippocampal D2 receptors. This novel mechanism of anticonvulsant action of NPY is separate from, and may be complementary to, the well established Y2 receptor-mediated inhibition of hippocampal excitability.
A unique case of community acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis, with endocardial and cerebral metastatic seeding, caused by a strain representative of the Italian clone, is described. The patient was a 47-y-old man without apparent risk factors for endocarditis and for MRSA infection who developed coma with multiple cerebritis lesions under vancomycin plus amikacin therapy. He was eventually cured with the addition of linezolid to the initial antimicrobial regimen. This observation seems to confirm previous reports of the efficacy of linezolid for the treatment of central nervous system infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-positive bacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MRSA disseminated cerebritis, a nearly always fatal disease, cured with this oxazolidinone drug. The increase in community acquired MRSA may have some impact on empirical treatment of serious infections caused by this organism.
A possible mechanism by which large doses of catecholamines produce myocardial necrosis was investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 275 to 325 g in weight, were injected once, sc, with 3 mg/kg epinephrine (E) or infused iv for 1 hr with E at a rate of 1.2 or 1.7 micrograms/min, and also injected iv with either 45Ca or [3H]palmitic acid (3H-PA) at the same time as or at various periods of time after E administration but exactly 0.5 or 1 hr before death. Controls were injected with saline solution. Heart/plasma ratios of radioactivity (H/P) were determined. The ratios increased in the case of both 45Ca and [3H]PA within 0.5 hr after E, reached peak values after 18 to 24 hr with 45Ca and 3 to 6 hr with [3H]PA, and remained above values for the controls for at least 72 hr with 45Ca and 48 hr with [3H]PA. The rate of 45Ca influx into heart 20 hr after E administration paralleled the severity of the myocardial damage that had been produced. When 45Ca and E were injected simultaneously, H/P increased progressively with time to 30 times control values, indicating the accumulation and retention of Ca in the heart. Under the same conditions, H/P values with [3H]PA also rose but remained constant at a level two to three times that in controls. Total cardiac free fatty acids (FFA) rose slightly and remained constant at the elevated level. It was not possible to distinguish a given point in time at which the increase in either Ca or FFA influx, initially due to the normal pharmacological effect of E, began to occur as a consequence of damage produced by the latter. It is concluded that high concentrations of catecholamines promote the deposition of Ca and FFA in myocardial cells in various forms, and that the deposition of these substances as soaps in the plasma membranes may cause permeability changes that lead to cell injury.
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens. In high doses, its nonhematological dose-limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy.
We combined paclitaxel, melphalan and high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin in a triple sequential high-dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96-h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure (CHF) and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, age, hypertension, prior cardiac history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, prior use of anthracyclines, and left-sided chest irradiation.
Six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%. Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide-related cardiac toxicity (10%) is comparable to previous recorded literature. Older age was significantly correlated with the CHF development; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing CHF of 45 and 59, respectively. No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics.
As a result of these findings, oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients. Routine EKG monitoring during infusional cyclophosphamide did not predict CHF development.
A case of renal failure in a patient with severe central nervous system symptoms during oral acyclovir medication is reported. A 68-year-old man maintained on hemodialysis was given oral acyclovir 4,000 mg daily in divided doses because of herpes zoster affecting the left C3/5 dermatomes. He had vomiting and confusion 36 hours after administration. He had no focal neurological signs. The symptoms resolved 4 days after cessation of acyclovir administration and blood purification every day. Because of its high therapeutic index the use of acyclovir is associated with few side effects. In patients with renal failure the half-life of acyclovir is prolonged, this report indicates the importance of adhering to the dosage reductions in patients with renal failure.
