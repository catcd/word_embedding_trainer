Despite expectations that 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) would prove active primarily in lymphoproliferative diseases, early reports suggested unexpected high activity of this drug in heavily pretreated children with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) at a maximally tolerated dose of 8.9 mg/m2/day for 5 days. In view of these findings, we conducted an escalating dose trial of 2-CdA in adult patients with relapsed or resistant AML. Thirty-six patients who had received extensive prior therapy were treated at 9 dose levels of 2-CdA at daily doses ranging from 5 to 21 mg/m2 for 5 days. 2-CdA eliminated leukemic blasts from the peripheral blood in 32 of 36 cases; however, bone marrow hypoplasia was seen only at daily dose levels > or = 15 mg/m2. We observed a total of 3 complete remissions: 1 at the 15 mg/m2/d dose level and 2 at the 21 mg/m2/d dose level; these responses persisted for 3, 2, and 3 months, respectively. Although prolonged myelosuppression would have been dose-limiting at 21 mg/m2/d for 5 days, the most important adverse effect was the development of a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. This reaction, whose onset was substantially delayed after completion of drug treatment, was observed in 2 of 5 patients at the 19 mg/m2/d level and in 4 of 4 evaluable patients at the 21 mg/m2/d level. Pathologically, this process was characterized by axonal degeneration and secondary demyelination. Other side effects included reactivation of a posttransplant Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoma in 1 patient and tumor lysis syndrome. We conclude that the maximally tolerable dose of 2-CdA in adult patients (17 mg/m2/d for 5 days) in approximately twofold in excess of that previously reported in children and that the limiting toxic effect is a degenerative neuropathic disorder. We confirm that this drug has definite activity in AML, but the magnitude of this effect needs to be determined in larger numbers of patients who have received less extensive therapy. This agent deserves further evaluation in patients with both AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia at these higher doses and perhaps as part of a preparative regimen for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.
Dofetilide, a new class III antiarrhythmic agent, has been approved as an antiarrhythmic agent for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Dofetilide selectively inhibits the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current resulting in a prolongation of the effective refractory period. Like other drugs that affect potassium currents, the prolonged QT interval occurring in the patients treated with dofetilide can be complicated by torsades de pointes. We report four cases of dofetilide-induced QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. We discuss the risk factors for the development of dofetilide-induced long QT and torsades de pointes and review the current literature.
To study in series the p16 protein expression on the rat brain tumor induced transplacentally by ENU.
The p16 protein expression was determined with immuno-histochemistry stain on the offspring's brain at their 60, 90, 120, 150 days after birth.
(1) p16 proteins were expressed in all of the brain samples in the 60-day group; occasionally negative in the 90-day group; partly expressed in the 120-day group; significantly less expressed in the 150-day group. (2) The rate of expression in the tissue around tumor was higher than that in the tumor. (3) The p16 protein was mainly orientated in the nuclear of cell and sporadically orientated in the cytoplasm.
(1) It shows the p16 protein expression decreases with the increase of tumor incidence in the rat brain, which accompanies the start and development of the induced tumor. So we speculate that the dysfunction of p16 gene is one of the factors related to tumor incidence in this animal model. (2) The p16 protein is mainly orientated in the nuclear of cell and sporadically orientated in the cytoplasm.
The frequency and types of major CNS toxicity and morbidity were analyzed in 107 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) following an isolated primary CNS relapse. Seventy-nine (73%) have had multiple subsequent marrow or CNS relapses requiring intensive and prolonged therapy to the CNS. Median survival time is two years. Of these 79 patients, two thirds have had one or more types of major CNS toxicity, including epileptiform seizures (35), moderate to severe structural abnormalities (24 of 27 evaluated), major motor disabilities (9), blindness (2), CNS infection (6), cranial nerve palsies (2), and intracranial lymphoma (2). The remaining 28 patients (26%) have had no or one additional CNS relapse and have received therapy for a median of eight years. One half of this surviving group of patients have had major CNS toxicity, including seizures (9), major motor disability (2), and intracranial calcifications (12/19). When neuropsychologic evaluations were compared between the 28 survivors and 50 of their contemporaries who had been in initial continuous complete remission, the CNS survivors had significantly lower Full Scale IQ scores (83 +/- 16 v 99 +/- 14, P = less than .001) with similarly lower measures of academic performance. The relative contributions of meningeal leukemia itself and intrathecal or radiation therapy to these effects cannot be determined. Since major CNS sequelae occurred in the majority of patients who had a primary isolated CNS relapse, and the frequency of CNS relapse is dependent on the efficacy of the method of CNS prophylaxis, the best method of avoiding major CNS sequelae is the most effective form of CNS prophylaxis.
Previous studies from our group investigated the antinociceptive property of amyrin octanoate, a synthetic compound derivative from natural precursor alpha, beta-amyrin, against nociceptive response induced by acetic acid and formalin. Here, we investigated some of the mechanisms of action underlying the antinociceptive effects of amyrin octanoate. Amyrin octanoate given intraperitoneally (0.001-1 mg /kg) or intrathecally (10-1000 ng /site) caused dose-dependent and long-lasting inhibition of acetic acid-induced visceral nociception, with mean ID(50) values of 0.003 (0.001-0.005) mg/kg and 122.4 (60.8-246.6) ng/site, respectively. In the capsaicin- and glutamate-induced paw licking, amyrin octanoate caused significant and dose-dependent inhibition of both nociceptive responses, with ID(50) values of 1.36 and 0.04 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, amyrin octanoate also reduced significantly the nociception caused by intrathecal injection of glutamate, substance P and capsaicin, with inhibitions of 36+/-11%, 67+/-10% and 78+/-5%, respectively. The antinociception caused by amyrin octanoate in the acetic acid test was significantly attenuated by neonatal pretreatment of mice with capsaicin, but seems to involve mechanisms independent of G(i/o) protein, opioidergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic system, since it was not affected by pertussis toxin, naloxone, yohimbine, mecamylamine or atropine. In addition, amyrin octanoate reduced thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia induced by bradykinin and phorbol myristate acetate in rats, without affecting similar responses caused by prostaglandin E(2). Taken together, the present results shown that octanoate amyrin produces antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic effects, through an interaction with capsaicin-sensitive fibers and the inhibition of the PKC signaling pathway.
alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-A.T.) phenotypes were determined in 55 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (R.A.), 33 patients with R.A. and either obstructive airways disease or recurrent chest infections, 49 patients with fibrosing alveolitis (F.A.), 22 patients with R.A. and F.A., and 200 healthy controls. A highly significant increase in the frequency of MZ phenotype was found among patients with F.A., both with and without R.A. Patients with R.A. alone had a normal distribution of phenotypes. Inherited modification of immune function may predispose to F.A. Alternatively, lowered levels of alpha 1-A.T. associated with non-M phenotypes may predispose to tissue damage with subsequent fibrosis.
The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat shows age-dependent hepatic manifestations that are similar to those of Wilson's disease (WD). The pathogenic process in the brain has, however, not been evaluated in detail due to the rarity of the neurological symptoms. However, copper accumulation is noted in LEC rat brain tissue from 24 weeks of age, which results in oxidative injuries. The current study investigated the gene expression profiles of LEC rat brains at 24 weeks of age in order to identify the important early molecular changes that underlie the development of neurological symptoms in WD. Biological ontology-based analysis revealed diverse altered expressions of the genes related to copper accumulation. Of particular interest, we found altered expression of genes connected to mitochondrial respiration (Sdhaf2 and Ndufb7), calcineurin-mediated cellular processes (Ppp3ca, Ppp3cb, and Camk2a), amyloid precursor protein (Anks1b and A2m) and alpha-synuclein (Snca). In addition to copper-related changes, compensatory upregulations of Cp and Hamp reflect iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Of note, reciprocal expression of Asmt and Bhmt is an important clue that altered S-adenosylhomocysteine metabolism underlies brain injury in WD, which is directly correlated to the decreased expression of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in hepatic tissue in LEC rats. In conclusion, our study indicates that diverse molecular changes, both variable and complex, underlie the development of neurological manifestations in WD. Copper-related injuries were found to be the principal pathogenic process, but Fe- or adenosylhomocysteine-related injuries were also implicated. Investigations using other animal models or accessible human samples will be required to confirm our observations.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart failure (HF) is generally considered a negative prognostic factor. Recent studies indicate that the incidence of AF might be decreased by renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors. The identification of a treatment to prevent its occurrence is likely to improve patients outcome. The aims of these subanalyses of Val-HeFT were to assess (a) the effects of valsartan in the prevention of AF, (b) the independent predictors of this event, and (c) the prognostic role of AF occurrence.
The occurrence of AF was evaluated based on adverse event reports in the patients with HF enrolled in Val-HeFT. Patients were randomized to valsartan or placebo on top of their prescribed treatments for HF. During the mean 23 months of follow-up, AF was reported in 287/4395 patients (6.53%) in sinus rhythm at baseline, of whom 113/2205 (5.12%) were allocated to valsartan and 174/2190 (7.95%) to placebo (P = .0002). Multivariable analysis showed that brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels at baseline above the median value (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.75-2.98), age over 70 years (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.17-1.95), male sex (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.07-2.18), and the valsartan treatment (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81) were independently associated with AF occurrence. Cox multivariable regression analysis showed that occurrence of AF was independently associated with a worse prognosis, with the adjusted hazard risks for all-cause mortality and combined mortality/morbidity of 1.40 (95% CI 1.16-1.58) and 1.38 (95% CI 1.12-1.70), respectively.
The results of the present study demonstrate that (a) adding valsartan to prescribed therapy for HF significantly reduces the incidence of AF by 37%; (b) BNP level and advanced age were the strongest independent predictors for AF occurrence; and (c) AF occurrence further worsens the outcome in patients with HF.
Residual neuromuscular block caused by vecuronium alters pharyngeal function and impairs airway protection. The primary objectives of this investigation were to radiographically evaluate the swallowing act and to record the incidence of and the mechanism behind pharyngeal dysfunction during partial neuromuscular block. The secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of atracurium on pharyngeal function.
Twenty healthy volunteers were studied while awake during liquid-contrast bolus swallowing. The incidence of pharyngeal dysfunction was studied by fluoroscopy. The initiation of the swallowing process, the pharyngeal coordination, and the bolus transit time were evaluated. Simultaneous manometry was used to document pressure changes at the tongue base, the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, and the upper esophageal sphincter. After control recordings, an intravenous infusion of atracurium was administered to obtain train-of-four ratios (T4/T1) of 0.60, 0.70, and 0.80, followed by recovery to a train-of-four ratio of more than 0.90.
The incidence of pharyngeal dysfunction was 6% during the control recordings and increased (P < 0.05) to 28%, 17%, and 20% at train-of-four ratios 0.60, 0.70, and 0.80, respectively. After recovery to a train-of-four ratio of more than 0.90, the incidence was 13%. Pharyngeal dysfunction occurred in 74 of 444 swallows, the majority (80%) resulting in laryngeal penetration. The initiation of the swallowing reflex was impaired during partial paralysis (P = 0.0081). The pharyngeal coordination was impaired at train-of-four ratios of 0.60 and 0.70 (P < 0.01). A marked reduction in the upper esophageal sphincter resting tone was found, as well as a reduced contraction force in the pharyngeal constrictor muscles. The bolus transit time did not change significantly.
Partial neuromuscular paralysis caused by atracurium is associated with a four- to fivefold increase in the incidence of misdirected swallowing. The mechanism behind the pharyngeal dysfunction is a delayed initiation of the swallowing reflex, impaired pharyngeal muscle function, and impaired coordination. The majority of misdirected swallows resulted in penetration of bolus to the larynx.
The present study compares the effects of Ro 31-6930, a novel potassium channel opener, with those of cromakalim and nitrendipine on blood pressure and other haemodynamic parameters. In conscious, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) the oral dose of Ro 31-6930 for lowering blood pressure was 10 times lower than that of cromakalim and some 100 times lower than that of nitrendipine. In addition, the duration of antihypertensive activity of Ro 31-6930 was longer than that of cromakalim or nitrendipine. The tachycardia evoked by Ro 31-6930 and cromakalim was of shorter duration than the antihypertensive effect of either agent. In a repeat, once daily dosing experiment no tolerance was observed to the antihypertensive effect of Ro 31-6930 over a 22-day period. In conscious normotensive cats Ro 31-6930 was 10 times more potent than cromakalim and 1,000 times more potent than nitrendipine in reducing blood pressure. The duration of hypotensive activity was in excess of 5 h for each agent. In anaesthetised dogs all three agents reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR), while increasing cardiac output (CO) via a rise in stroke volume (SV). Both Ro 31-6930 and cromakalim significantly reduced femoral (FVR) and mesenteric vascular resistances (MVR), while only cromakalim reduced renal vascular resistance (RVR). Ro 31-6930 is a potent new antihypertensive agent that compares favourably with cromakalim and nitrendipine.
To determine the efficacy and safety of patient-controlled epidural analgesia of morphine or fentanyl in combination with bupivacaine for postoperative pain relief.
Forty ASA I-II patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery were studied. After insertion of a lumbar epidural catheter, patients were given a non-opioid general anaesthetic. After surgery patients complaining of pain, received a loading dose of 2 mg morphine (Group I) or 50 micrograms fentanyl (Group II). For continuing pain, 1 mg morphine in 4 ml bupivacaine 0.125% (0.25 mg.ml-1 morphine and 1 mg.ml-1 bupivacaine, Group I) or 20 micrograms fentanyl in 4 ml bupivacaine 0.125% (5 micrograms.ml-1 fentanyl and 1 mg.ml-1 bupivacaine Group II) were administered. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and SpO2 were monitored. Assessments of pain (VAS), nausea-vomiting, motor block, pruritus and sedation were recorded for 24 hr.
No difference in pain or sedation was observed between groups. The 24 hr postoperative opioid consumption was 15.50 +/- 7.53 mg morphine and 555.10 +/- 183.85 micrograms fentanyl. Total bupivacaine 0.125% consumption was 58.00 +/- 30.14 ml in Group I and 101.05 +/- 36.77 ml in Group II. One patient in Group II complained of motor weakness in one leg. The incidence of nausea (Group I 45%, Group II 10% P < 0.05) and pruritus (Group I 30%, Group II 5% P < 0.05) was less in patients receiving fentanyl.
Both methods were effective in the prevention of pain but, because of fewer side effects, fentanyl may be preferable to morphine.
Thiopental is an anesthetic used for controlling high intracranial pressure (ICP) caused by brain surgery, brain trauma, and severe stroke. However, it remains controversial whether Thiopental is detrimental or beneficial in ischemic stroke. In this study, we used an animal model of ischemic stroke in spontaneously hypertensive rats to determine whether or not Thiopental is neuroprotective in the setting of brain ischemia. We observed that Thiopental caused a prolonged duration of unconsciousness with a high rate of mortality, that Thiopental created exaggerated neurological deficits that were revealed through limb placement tests at 4 days and 4 weeks after brain ischemia, and that infarct volume was increased in Thiopental-anesthetized rats. These data suggest that Thiopental is detrimental in ischemic stroke. Thus, our findings raise a caution about the use of Thiopental in the setting of ischemic stroke.
Brugada syndrome (BS) may be "unmasked" by several pharmacological and/or physiological agents in an otherwise normal electrocardiogram. Once diagnosed the possibility of persistent ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation exists. Although this is treated with various antiarrhythmic agents, there remains a cohort of patients who fail to respond to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy therefore, amplifying the electrical storm. We report a case of a BS diagnosed via procainamide challenge, the resultant near fatal electrical storm aggravated by amiodarone and the eventual resolution with isoproterenol.
Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is one of the strongest carcinogens in cigarette smoke, which is an established human carcinogen. Twist, a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix class, is reported to regulate lung cancer metastasis. Evidence has shown that BaP could induce Twist mRNA expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549 and promote lung adenocarcinoma cell invasion. However, it is unclear whether BaP promotes the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells by Twist modulation. A549 cell was exposed to BaP for different time. MTT assay was applied to assess cell proliferation. Silencing of Twist was done by small interfering RNA. Wound-healing assay was used to evaluate the capability of cell migration. Transwell assay was used to detect the capability of cell invasion. Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect Twist expression. The levels of Twist protein expression and mRNA expression were increased with the treatment of BaP, compared with solvent control. The capability of wound healing of A549 cells was increased in BaP-treated group, compared with solvent control. BaP enhanced the capability of invasion of A549 cells. Twist knockdown could block the migration and invasion of A549 cells induced by BaP treatment. The mRNA levels of Twist were higher in metastatic NSCLC tissue samples than in primary NSCLC tissue samples, and higher levels of Twist mRNA were observed in metastatic NSCLC tissue samples with smoking history than in those with nonsmoking history. BaP treatment could promote the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells by up-regulating Twist expression.
To compare the analgesic efficacy and level of motor block using two local anesthetics, ropivacaine and bupivacaine, during labor.
Sixty nulliparous women were enrolled during labor after full-term pregnancies. They were randomly assigned to receive epidural analgesia with ropivacaine (group R) or bupivacaine (group B). Group R patients received 10 ml of 0.18% ropivacaine with 5 microgram/ml of fentanyl followed by continuous epidural infusion of 0.1% ropivacaine with 2 microgram/ml of fentanyl at a rate of 10 ml/h. Group B patients received 10 ml of 0.15% bupivacaine with 5 microgram/ml of fentanyl followed by continuous epidural perfusion of 0.0625% bupivacaine with 2 microgram/ml of fentanyl at the same rate. Pain intensity was assessed on a visual analog scale, motor blockade on a Bromage scale, and level of sensory block at different moments. We also recorded total doses of local anesthetic employed during continuous epidural infusion, manner of final delivery, Apgar score, degree of maternal satisfaction and side effects.
The demographic and delivery characteristics were similar in both groups. We found no statistically significant differences between the two groups for level of motor blockade, which was nil for 29 patients (96.66%) in group R and 28 patients (93.33%) in group B. No differences in degree of pain or level of sensory block (T8-T10 in both groups) were observed. The total doses of local anesthetic used were similar at 23.7 +/- 11.6 mg in group R and 16.5 +/- 7.3 mg in group B (non-significant difference). Nor did we find differences in manner of delivery, neonatal Apgar scores, degree of maternal satisfaction or side effects.
Ropivacaine and bupivacaine are equally effective for epidural analgesia during labor at the doses used and they do not cause a relevant level of motor blockade.
A 22-year-old female patient with epilepsy for more than six years who had prominent psychiatric manifestations, including paranoia, delusions and hallucinations, after a series of major seizure attacks caused by sudden withdrawal of anticonvulsant medication was monitored. This reported episode of psychosis occurred eight hours after the last seizure attack and lasted for two weeks. The psychosis gradually disappeared after administration of lorazepam. The electroencephalogram (EEG) performed during the period of psychosis showed intermittent slow activity in the bilateral frontal regions of the brain. There were active bisynchronous epileptiform discharges bisynchronously in both frontotemporal regions after the resolution of the psychotic episode. The clinical picture and course were consistent with the diagnosis of "postictal psychosis", and the transient near normal EEG during psychosis was most likely a phenomenon known as "forced normalization". The patient has not had a similar psychotic attack since the one reported here.
Fetal poisoning of California sea lions (CSLs; Zalophus californianus) has been associated with exposure to the algal toxin domoic acid. These same sea lions accumulate a mixture of persistent environmental contaminants including pesticides and industrial products such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Developmental exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its stable metabolite 1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (p,p -DDE) has been shown to enhance domoic acid-induced seizures in zebrafish; however, the contribution of other co-occurring contaminants is unknown.
We formulated a mixture of contaminants to include PCBs, PBDEs, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and chlordane at levels matching those reported for fetal CSL blubber to determine the impact of co-occurring persistent contaminants with p,p -DDE on chemically induced seizures in zebrafish as a model for the CSLs.
Embryos were exposed (6-30 hr postfertilization) to p,p -DDE in the presence or absence of a defined contaminant mixture prior to neurodevelopment via either bath exposure or embryo yolk sac microinjection. After brain maturation (7 days postfertilization), fish were exposed to a chemical convulsant, either pentylenetetrazole or domoic acid; resulting seizure behavior was then monitored and analyzed for changes, using cameras and behavioral tracking software.
Induced seizure behavior did not differ significantly between subjects with embryonic exposure to a contaminant mixture and those exposed to p,p -DDE only.
These studies demonstrate that p,p -DDE--in the absence of PCBs, HCH, chlordane, and PBDEs that co-occur in fetal sea lions--accounts for the synergistic activity that leads to greater sensitivity to domoic acid seizures.
A patient was treated for a convulsive disorder with "average" doses of diphenylhydantoin, and developed a cerebellar syndrome secondary to drug intoxication, documented by the presence of diphenylhydantoin blood levels above 60 microgram/ml. The individual's low capacity to metabolize the drug appeared to be responsible for the intoxication. The patient has been followed for two years after withdrawal of diphenylhydantoin, and remains incapacitated by a severe unchanged ataxia. The literature on the debated subject of permanent cerebellar degeneration due to diphenylhydantoin is reviewed. The importance of a strict clinical supervision and the measurement of diphenylhydantoin blood levels in any patient treated with this drug is stressed.
Gypenoside LXXIV (G-74), a major constituent of GYNOSTEMMA PENTAPHYLLUM Makino (GP; family Cucurbitaceae), was isolated and its memory-enhancing effects were investigated in scopolamine-treated mice in passive-avoidance and Morris water maze tests. G-74 potently reversed memory impairment caused by scopolamine. G-74 also significantly shortened the scopolamine-prolonged escape latencies in the Morris water maze test (p < 0.05) and increased the scopolamine-shortened swimming time within the platform quadrant (p < 0.05). Based on these findings, G-74 might improve learning deficits.
There are conflicting reports regarding the effects of atrazine (ATZ) on amphibian development. Therefore, further studies are needed to examine the potential mechanisms of action of ATZ in amphibians.
Our aim in this study was to determine whether low concentrations of ATZ affect gonadal development and metamorphosis in the Northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens.
Tadpoles were exposed in outdoor mesocosms to nominal concentrations of 0.1 and 1.8 microg/L of formulated ATZ from Gosner stage 27 (G27) to metamorphic climax (G42). Exposure to 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2; 1.5 microg/L) provided a positive control for induction of testicular oocytes in males. Endocrine-related gene expression and gonadal histopathology were examined at G42 and in a subset of premetamorphic G34 tadpoles that failed to metamorphose.
Gonadal gross morphology revealed that the 1.8-microg/L ATZ treatment produced 20% more females compared with the control. Histologic analysis revealed that 22% of EE2-treated males had testicular oocytes, whereas none were observed in any animals from the control or either ATZ groups. ATZ increased brain estrogen receptor alpha mRNA to 2.5 times that of the control at premetamorphosis and altered liver levels of 5beta-reductase activity at metamorphosis. In contrast, brain aromatase mRNA level and activity did not change. ATZ treatments significantly reduced metamorphic success (number of animals reaching metamorphosis) without affecting body weight, snout-vent length, or age at metamorphosis. Gene expression analysis indicated that ATZ decreased the expression of deiodinase type 3 in the tail at premetamorphosis.
Our study indicates that exposure to low concentrations of ATZ in experimental mesocosms alters gonadal differentiation and metamorphosis in developing R. pipiens.
After the collapse of the World Trade Center (WTC) on 11 September 2001, a dense cloud of dust containing high levels of airborne pollutants covered Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, New York. Between 60,000 and 70,000 responders were exposed. Many reported adverse health effects.
In this report we describe clinical, pathologic, and mineralogic findings in seven previously healthy responders who were exposed to WTC dust on either 11 September or 12 September 2001, who developed severe respiratory impairment or unexplained radiologic findings and underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical lung biopsy procedures at Mount Sinai Medical Center. WTC dust samples were also examined. We found that three of the seven responders had severe or moderate restrictive disease clinically. Histopathology showed interstitial lung disease consistent with small airways disease, bronchiolocentric parenchymal disease, and nonnecrotizing granulomatous condition. Tissue mineralogic analyses showed variable amounts of sheets of aluminum and magnesium silicates, chrysotile asbestos, calcium phosphate, and calcium sulfate. Small shards of glass containing mostly silica and magnesium were also found. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) of various sizes and lengths were noted. CNT were also identified in four of seven WTC dust samples.
These findings confirm the previously reported association between WTC dust exposure and bronchiolar and interstitial lung disease. Long-term monitoring of responders will be needed to elucidate the full extent of this problem. The finding of CNT in both WTC dust and lung tissues is unexpected and requires further study.
Dopamine receptor antagonists are commonly used to counter the adverse effects of opioids such as hallucinations, delusions and emesis. However, most of these agents themselves have side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms. Here, we investigated the effect of the dopamine system stabilizer aripiprazole on morphine-induced dopamine-related actions in mice. Morphine-induced hyperlocomotion and reward were significantly suppressed by either the dopamine receptor antagonist prochlorperazine or aripiprazole. Catalepsy was observed with a high dose of prochlorperazine, but not with an even higher dose of aripiprazole. The increased level of dialysate dopamine in the nucleus accumbens stimulated by morphine was significantly decreased by pretreatment with aripiprazole. These results suggest that the co-administration of aripiprazole may be useful for reducing the severity of morphine-induced dopamine-related side effects.
We investigated the expressions of p57(kip2) and p27(kip) and its regulation by steroids in the normal and abnormal human endometrium. Endometrial p27(kip1) and p57(kip2) messenger RNA (mRNA) were markedly increased in the secretory phase. P57(kip2) protein was absent in proliferative phase but appeared in glandular epithelium together with early- to mid-secretory phase stromal cells. During the late secretory phase, strong P57(kip2) protein immunoreactivity was found in the stromal cells. In both endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, the expression of P57(kip2) protein was low. In cultured human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs), p27(kip1) mRNA levels were increased together with the decidual marker prolactin (prl), following treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). At 1 nmol/L, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist dexamethasone (DEX) induced prl, p57(kip2) , and p27(kip1) mRNA in ESCs. Taken together, upregulation of p57(kip2) may play an important role in the decidual differentiation by P4 and growth inhibition of malignant cells in human endometrium.
Intradermal (ID) capsaicin injection in humans induces spontaneous pain, flare, primary hyperalgesia, secondary hyperalgesia, and allodynia. Secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia are a reflection of central sensitization. The effect of treatment of single doses of (1) pregabalin, 300 mg single oral dose, and (2) morphine, 10 mg IV, on the area of secondary hyperalgesia induced by ID capsaicin injection was studied by using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 4-period, cross-over design in 20 healthy men. Compared with active placebo diphenhydramine (50 mg oral dose), pregabalin and morphine significantly reduced the area of secondary hyperalgesia over 15 to 240 minutes after capsaicin injection (approximately 25%, P = .002 and approximately 33%, P < .001, respectively). A smaller reduction was observed when pregabalin and morphine were compared with true placebo (approximately 13%, P = .081 and approximately 24%, P = .009, respectively). Diphenhydramine, on the other hand, increased the area of secondary hyperalgesia in comparison with true placebo (approximately 16%, P = .061). The relationship between the baseline area of hyperalgesia and assay sensitivity suggests that establishing minimum entry criteria for the baseline area of hyperalgesia requirement increases the sensitivity of the assay.
These results suggest that the minimally invasive intradermal capsaicin model, when it is compared with true placebo, can potentially be used for an early assessment of relevant pharmacology of novel analgesic compounds in healthy subjects. This platform may provide a means to rapidly assess new analgesics and enhance dose selection and decision-making during clinical development.
In vitro cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) metabolizes omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs); eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), primarily to 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-EEQ) and 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid (19,20-EDP), respectively. These metabolites have been shown to mediate vasodilation via increases in nitric oxide (NO) and activation of potassium channels. We hypothesized that genetic deletion of CYP1A1 would reduce vasodilatory responses to n-3 PUFAs, but not the metabolites, and increase blood pressure (BP) due to decreases in NO. We assessed BP by radiotelemetry in CYP1A1 wildtype (WT) and knockout (KO) mice±NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor. We also assessed vasodilation to acetylcholine (ACh), EPA, DHA, 17,18-EEQ and 19,20-EDP in aorta and mesenteric arterioles. Further, we assessed vasodilation to an NO donor and to DHA±inhibitors of potassium channels. CYP1A1 KO mice were hypertensive, compared to WT, (mean BP in mmHg, WT 103±1, KO 116±1, n=5/genotype, p<0.05), and exhibited a reduced heart rate (beats per minute, WT 575±5; KO 530±7; p<0.05). However, BP responses to NOS inhibition and vasorelaxation responses to ACh and an NO donor were normal in CYP1A1 KO mice, suggesting that NO bioavailability was not reduced. In contrast, CYP1A1 KO mice exhibited significantly attenuated vasorelaxation responses to EPA and DHA in both the aorta and mesenteric arterioles, but normal vasorelaxation responses to the CYP1A1 metabolites, 17,18-EEQ and 19,20-EDP, and normal responses to potassium channel inhibition. Taken together these data suggest that CYP1A1 metabolizes n-3 PUFAs to vasodilators in vivo and the loss of these vasodilators may lead to increases in BP.
