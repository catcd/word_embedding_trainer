A case-control study was conducted to analyze the possible associations between the head and neck cancer (HNC) risk and fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in Xrcc3 and Rad51 genes. This study involved 81 HNC cases and 111 healthy control subjects. A significant risk-increasing effect of rs3212057 (p.Arg94His) SNP in Xrcc3 (OR=6.6; p<0.01) was observed. On the other hand, risk-decreasing effect was found for rs5030789 (g.3997A>G) and rs1801321 (c.-60G>T) in 5' near gene and 5'UTR regions of Rad51, respectively (OR=0.3 and OR=0.2, p<0.05, respectively). Moreover, these effects were shown to be modulated by tobacco-smoking status and gene-gene interactions. Concluding, the genetic variability of Xrcc3 and/or Rad51 genes might be of relevance with respect to HNC risk.
Acute kidney injury (AKI) during warfarin therapy usually is hemodynamic secondary to massive blood loss. Here, we report pathological findings in kidney biopsy specimens from 9 patients with warfarin overdose, hematuria, and AKI. Kidney biopsy specimens from patients on warfarin therapy with AKI were identified in our database within a 5-year period. Each kidney biopsy specimen was evaluated by using semiquantitative morphometric techniques, and medical history was reviewed for conditions explaining AKI. Biopsy specimens with morphological findings of active glomerulonephritis and active inflammatory lesions were excluded from the study. Biopsy specimens from 9 patients were selected. At presentation with AKI, each patient had an abnormal international normalized ratio (mean 4.4 +/- 0.7 IU) and increased serum creatinine level (mean, 4.3 +/- 0.8 mg/dL). Morphologically, each biopsy specimen showed evidence of acute tubular injury and glomerular hemorrhage: red blood cells (RBCs) in Bowman space and numerous occlusive RBC casts in tubules. Each biopsy specimen showed chronic kidney injury. Six of 9 patients did not recover from AKI. These data suggest that warfarin therapy can result in AKI by causing glomerular hemorrhage and renal tubular obstruction by RBC casts. Our experience suggests that this may be a potentially serious complication of warfarin therapy, especially in older patients with underlying chronic kidney injury.
The adverse effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the upper gastrointestinal tract and small intestine are well established. The effect of such therapy on the large intestine, so called NSAID colopathy, is less well described. We present four such cases demonstrating the characteristic endoscopic findings. One case in particular is, to our knowledge, the first report of the natural history of this clinical entity, initially presenting with the acute picture of inflammation and ulceration with subsequent progression to the more chronic development of diaphragm-like fibrous strictures. NSAID-induced colonic damage is a clinically significant condition. Two of our patients presented with bloody diarrhoea while the other two patients developed symptomatic anaemia. With the increasing use of enteric coated and sustained release NSAID preparations this condition is likely to become more frequent. Increasing awareness of its clinical presentation and of its spectrum of endoscopic findings facilitates a more prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment to be established.
The antiretroviral nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) stavudine (d4T) can induce mild to severe liver injuries such as steatosis (i.e. triglyceride accumulation), steatohepatitis and liver failure. NRTI-induced toxicity has been ascribed to the inhibition of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication causing mtDNA depletion and respiratory chain dysfunction. This can secondarily impair the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), thus leading to lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis. However, NRTIs could also impair mitochondrial function and induce hepatic steatosis through other mechanisms. In this study, we sought to determine whether d4T could inhibit mitochondrial FAO and induce triglyceride accumulation through a mtDNA-independent mechanism. Since human tumoral and non-tumoral hepatic cell lines were unable to efficiently oxidize palmitic acid, the effects of d4T on mitochondrial FAO were assessed on cultured rat hepatocytes. Our results showed that 750 microM of d4T significantly inhibited palmitic acid oxidation after 48 or 72 h of culture, without inducing cell death. Importantly, high concentrations of zidovudine and zalcitabine (two other NRTIs that can induce hepatic steatosis), or beta-aminoisobutyric acid (a d4T metabolite), did not impair FAO in rat hepatocytes. D4T-induced FAO inhibition was observed without mtDNA depletion and lactate production, and was fully prevented with l-carnitine or clofibrate coincubation. l-carnitine also prevented the accretion of neutral lipids within rat hepatocytes. High concentrations of d4T were unable to inhibit FAO on freshly isolated liver mitochondria. Moreover, a microarray analysis was performed to clarify the mechanism whereby d4T can inhibit mitochondrial FAO and induce triglyceride accumulation in rat hepatocytes. The microarray data, confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis, showed that d4T increased the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) and reduced that of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Finally, d4T-induced alteration of SREBP1c and MTP expression was partially prevented by l-carnitine. Thus, short-term incubation with high concentrations of d4T can rapidly induce accumulation of neutral lipids within rat hepatocytes, which can be fully prevented by l-carnitine. Furthermore, our investigations suggested that lipid accumulation could be the consequence of a dual mechanism, namely a mtDNA-independent impairment of mitochondrial FAO and a reduction of lipid export from the hepatocytes.
Several sirtuin family members (SIRT1-7), which are evolutionarily conserved NAD-dependent deacetylases, play an important role in carcinogenesis. However, their role in oral cancer has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether sirtuins play a role in oral cancer carcinogenesis.
The expression levels of all sirtuins in several oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines were compared with normal human oral keratinocytes and observed that SIRT3 was highly expressed. Therefore, tissue microarrays were used to evaluate the clinical relevance of this overexpression. SIRT3 down-regulation in OSCC cell proliferation and survival was investigated and analyzed by using cell-proliferation and cell-viability assays. Ionizing radiation and cisplatin were used to investigate whether SIRT3 down-regulation could increase the sensitivity of OSCC to both treatments. To further assess the in vivo role of SIRT3 in OSCC carcinogenesis, a floor-of-mouth oral cancer murine model was used to study the effect of SIRT3 down-regulation on OSCC tumor growth in immunodeficient mice.
The current results demonstrated for the first time that SIRT3 is overexpressed in OSCC in vitro and in vivo compared with other sirtuins. Down-regulation of SIRT3 inhibited OSCC cell growth and proliferation and increased OSCC cell sensitivity to radiation and cisplatin treatments in vitro. SIRT3 down-regulation also reduced tumor burden in vivo.
The current investigation revealed a novel role for SIRT3 in oral cancer carcinogenesis as a promoter of cell proliferation and survival, thus implicating SIRT3 as a new potential therapeutic target to treat oral cancer.
Verapamil-sensitive idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia is a rare diagnosis. A 31-year-old multiparous woman presented with shortness of breath, palpitations and new-onset, wide complex tachycardia at approximately 28 weeks' gestation. Multiple antiarrhythmic agents were administered without resolution of the arrhythmia. Verapamil-sensitive idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia was diagnosed on the basis of a fusion beat with a right bundle branch pattern, a pathognomonic finding, which was noted on an electrocardiogram. Verapamil resulted in conversion to normal sinus rhythm. The patient delivered at term uneventfully. To our knowledge, this is the first description of verapamil-sensitive idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia in pregnancy. The case illustrates that the origin of wide complex tachyarrhythmias should be identified to provide the proper treatment expeditiously.
Mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Superoxide dismutase-1 mutations decrease protein stability and promote aggregation. The mutant monomer is thought to be an intermediate in the pathway from the superoxide dismutase-1 dimer to aggregate. Here we find that the monomeric copper-apo, zinc-holo protein is structurally perturbed and the apo-protein aggregates without reattainment of the monomer-dimer equilibrium. Intervention to stabilize the superoxide dismutase-1 dimer and inhibit aggregation is regarded as a potential therapeutic strategy. We describe protein-ligand interactions for two compounds, Isoproterenol and 5-fluorouridine, highlighted as superoxide dismutase-1 stabilizers. We find both compounds interact with superoxide dismutase-1 at a key region identified at the core of the superoxide dismutase-1 fibrillar aggregates, Î²-barrel loop II-strand 3, rather than the proposed dimer interface site. This illustrates the need for direct structural observations when developing compounds for protein-targeted therapeutics.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of centrally administered neuropeptide Y (NPY) on muscular rigidity induced by fentanyl in Sprague-Dawley rats. They were anesthetized with ketamine (120 mg/kg, i.p.) and their lungs were mechanically ventilated. Intravenous administration of fentanyl (100 microg/kg) consistently evoked a significant increase in the electromyographic activity (EMG) recorded from the sacrococcygeus dorsalis lateralis muscle. This implied muscular rigidity was appreciably attenuated by intracerebroventricular administration of NPY (4 nmol/2.5 microl). Microinjection of NPY (40 or 160 pmol/50 nl) into the bilateral locus coeruleus (LC) elicited an inhibition of the EMG activation induced by fentanyl in a dose-dependent manner. Microinjection of 160 pmol NPY plus antiserum against NPY (NPY(Ab), 1:20) into the LC failed to suppress fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity. However, this implied muscular rigidity was not affected by NPY plus normal rabbit serum (NRS, 1:20). In addition, NPY(Ab) or NRS per se had no substantial effect on the rigidity. Microinjection of NPY (160 pmol) into the areas adjacent to the LC did not attenuate the rigidity. Our results suggest that the centrally administered NPY attenuated fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity by acting at the LC, but endogenous NPY may not be involved in this process.
Isolated reports of a possible positive effect of anti-coagulant drugs, among them heparin, warfarin and acenocumarol, in migraine prophylaxis are found in the literature. We report the case of a 37 years old man suffering from refractory chronic cluster headache that presented remission with the administration of warfarin for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis associated to arterial thrombosis. We did not found any case like that in the literature.
Many chemicals released into the environment have the capacity to disrupt the normal development of aquatic animals. We investigated the influence of nonylphenol (NP), bisphenol-A (BPA), and 17beta-estradiol (E2) on developing Xenopus laevis embryos, as a model animal in the aquatic environment. Embryos were exposed to eight different concentrations of NP, BPA or E2 between 3 and 96 h post-fertilization (p.f.). Short body length, microcephaly, flexure, edema, and abnormal gut coiling were induced by 20 microM NP, BPA or 10 microM E2 by 96 h p.f. To clarify sensitive stages to these compounds, embryos were exposed to chemicals for 45 or 48 h starting at different developmental stages and experiments were terminated 96 h p.f. BPA and NP induced abnormalities in developing X. laevis, though the sensitive stages of embryos to these chemicals are different, BPA affecting earlier stages and NP affecting at later stages. To analyze the functional mechanisms of BPA and NP in induction of morphological changes, we adapted a DNA array technology and identified 6 X. laevis genes, XIRG, alpha skeletal tropomyosin, cyclin G1, HGF, troponin C2, and ribosomal protein L9. These findings may provide important clues to elucidate common mechanisms underlying teratogenic effects of these chemicals.
Few descriptions of miliary brain metastases have been reported. We report the case of an adenocarcinoma of the lung associated with metachronous miliary brain and lung metastases with an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) gene translocation. The patient was treated with crizotinib and showed a twelve-month progression-free survival. Clinicians should be attentive of the evolution of brain metastases with patients presenting EML4-ALK translocation.
During arterial aneurysm formation, levels of the membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP, are elevated dramatically. Although MT1-MMP is expressed predominately by infiltrating macrophages, the roles played by the proteinase in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation in vivo remain undefined. Using a newly developed chimeric mouse model of AAA, we now demonstrate that macrophage-derived MT1-MMP plays a dominant role in disease progression. In wild-type mice transplanted with MT1-MMP-null marrow, aneurysm formation induced by the application of CaCl2 to the aortic surface was almost completely ablated. Macrophage infiltration into the aortic media was unaffected by MT1-MMP deletion, and AAA formation could be reconstituted when MT1-MMP+/+ macrophages, but not MT1-MMP+/+ lymphocytes, were infused into MT1-MMP-null marrow recipients. In vitro studies using macrophages isolated from either WT/MT1-MMP-/- chimeric mice, MMP-2-null mice, or MMP-9-null mice demonstrate that MT1-MMP alone plays a dominant role in macrophage-mediated elastolysis. These studies demonstrate that destruction of the elastin fiber network during AAA formation is dependent on macrophage-derived MT1-MMP, which unexpectedly serves as a direct-acting regulator of macrophage proteolytic activity.
Investigation of the role of choice between use of drugs of abuse and pursuit of alternative non-drug reinforcers is receiving greater attention. An understanding of the determinants influencing choice between drugs and alternative reinforcers will eventually lead to an understanding to the neural substrates of the drug altered brain. We investigated the impact of concurrent access to sucrose pellets on methamphetamine self-administration and self-regulated reinstatement of methamphetamine seeking following extinction training in Lewis rats. Our results from the self-administration experiment show that rats with concurrent access to sucrose self-administered significantly less methamphetamine compared to the methamphetamine only group. For our extinction/reinstatement experiment, concurrent access to sucrose during self-regulated methamphetamine reinstatement reduced methamphetamine intake and non-reinforced methamphetamine-seeking behavior in rats compared to rats that received access to just methamphetamine. These findings indicate that concurrent access to alternative reinforcers during various stages of methamphetamine-seeking behavior robustly decreased methamphetamine intake and serves as a valid rodent choice paradigm.
The current concept of dyskinesia is that pulsatile stimulation of D-1 or D-2 receptors by L-DOPA or short-acting dopamine agonists is more likely to induce dyskinesia compared to long-acting drugs producing more continuous receptor stimulation. We now investigate the ability of two mixed D-1/D-2 agonists, namely pergolide (long-acting) and apomorphine (short-acting), to induce dyskinesia in drug-nai;ve MPTP-lesioned primates, compared to L-DOPA. Adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were lesioned with MPTP (2 mg/kg/day sc for 5 days) and subsequently treated with equieffective antiparkinsonian doses of L-DOPA, apomorphine, or pergolide for 28 days. L-DOPA, apomorphine, and pergolide reversed the MPTP-induced motor deficits to the same degree with no difference in peak response. L-DOPA and apomorphine had a rapid onset of action and short duration of effect producing a pulsatile motor response, while pergolide had a slow onset and long-lasting activity producing a continuous profile of motor stimulation. L-DOPA rapidly induced dyskinesia that increased markedly in severity and frequency over the course of the study, impairing normal motor activity by day 20. Dyskinesia in animals treated with pergolide or apomorphine increased steadily, reaching mild to moderate severity but remaining significantly less marked than that produced by L-DOPA. There was no difference in the intensity of dyskinesia produced by apomorphine and pergolide. These data suggest that factors other than duration of drug action may be important in the induction of dyskinesia but support the use of dopamine agonists in early Parkinson's disease, as a means of delaying L-DOPA therapy and reducing the risk of developing dyskinesia.
Heart hypertrophy is a common cardiac complication of sustained arterial hypertension and is accompanied by an increased incidence of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Verapamil, a phenyalkylamine, belongs to the group of calcium channel antagonists (class IV antiarrhythmic drugs) and is frequently used for the management of supraventricular tachycardia and for ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Verapamil heart tissue and plasma levels after intraperitoneal dosing of spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats were investigated. Transcript expression of various ion channels, ion transporters, calcium handling, and cytoskeletal proteins by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were further investigated. There was no difference in plasma pharmacokinetics when hypertensive and normotensive animals were compared. Strikingly, the tissue clearance of verapamil was highly significantly impaired in heart tissue of hypertensive animals. Gene expression analysis showed the repression of many cardiac-specific genes in spontaneously hypertensive but not in normotensive rats, therefore providing evidence for different modes of action in healthy and hypertrophic hearts. Verapamil heart tissue levels differed dramatically between normotensive and hypertensive rats and resulted in repression of many cardiac ion channels, ion transporters, and calcium handling proteins. A disturbed ion homeostasis induced by critical tissue levels of verapamil is therefore proposed as a molecular rational for its pro-arrhythmogenic activity. The observed changes can be a significant determinant of spatial electrophysiological heterogeneity, thereby contributing to increased conductance disturbance as observed with some patients.
To study the effectiveness of activated charcoal in preventing toxicity after an enterally administered cocaine hydrochloride overdose in mice.
A prospective, randomized, controlled animal laboratory investigation.
Fasted mice were given aqueous cocaine hydrochloride (0.8% final concentration) 100 mg/kg body weight orally by gavage tube. One minute later, animals received one of three treatments by gavage: 1 g activated charcoal/kg body weight, 2 g activated charcoal/kg body weight, or an equivolume of water (control). All treatments consisted of 20 mL/kg body weight of an activated charcoal slurry with water.
After 24-hour observation, proportions of seizures and deaths between each group were compared using Pearson chi 2 test followed by Fisher's exact test (P < .017 for significance after Bonferroni's correction).
There were 20 seizures and 16 deaths in the control group (20 mice). There were four seizures (P = .0004) and one death (P = .0004) in the 1-g activated charcoal/kg group (ten mice) and five seizures (P = .0018) and three deaths (P = .015) in the 2-g activated charcoal/kg group (ten mice).
In this mouse model, activated charcoal decreased the incidence of seizures and death after an enteral cocaine hydrochloride overdose.
C-reactive protein (CRP) has been suggested to participate in the development of atherosclerosis, in part, by promoting endothelial dysfunction and impairing endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) survival and differentiation. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of CRP on antioxidative enzymes, reactive oxygen species production, telomerase activity, and apoptosis in human circulating EPCs.
EPCs, isolated from peripheral venous blood, were cultured in the absence or presence of native pentameric azide and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-free CRP (0, 5, 15, and 20 microg/mL), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis was used for the measurement of intracellular H2O2 and superoxide (O2(-)) by loading cells with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA). Apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V immunostaining and cytosolic cytochrome c expression. Western blot analysis was used for the determination of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase expression, and polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to assess telomerase activity. Incubation of EPCs with CRP caused a concentration dependent increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis, with an effect quantitatively similar to H2O2. This effect was attenuated during coincubation with NAC or anti-CRP antibodies. Furthermore, CRP altered EPC antioxidative enzyme levels, demonstrating a reduced expression of glutathione peroxidase and a significant increase in MnSOD expression. Transfection of EPCs with MnSOD-RNAi resulted in a reduction in CRP-induced ROS production, apoptosis, and telomerase inactivation.
CRP, at concentrations known to predict cardiovascular events, may serve to impair EPC antioxidant defenses, and promote EPC sensitivity toward oxidant-mediated apoptosis and telomerase inactivation. These data further support a direct role of CRP in the development and/or progression of atherothrombosis.
To determine the relative efficacy and toxicity of stibogluconate and ketoconazole for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a comparative trial was conducted in which 120 Guatemalan men with parasitologically proven cutaneous leishmaniasis were randomly divided into three treatment groups: sodium stibogluconate (20 mg of antimony per kilogram per day intravenously for 20 days), ketoconazole (600 mg per day orally for 28 days), and placebo. Treatment outcome was influenced by species. Among patients infected with Leishmania braziliensis, 24 (96%) of 25 in the stibogluconate group but only 7 (30%) of 23 in the ketoconazole group responded. Among Leishmania mexicana-infected patients, only 4 (57%) of 7 in the stibogluconate group but 8 (89%) of 9 in the ketoconazole group responded. These differences emphasize the importance of speciation in the treatment of leishmaniasis.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for > 350 million cases of chronic hepatitis B worldwide and 1.2 million deaths each year. To explore the use of ribozymes as a novel therapy for HBV infection, nuclease-resistant ribozymes that target highly conserved regions of HBV RNA were screened in cell culture. These synthetic ribozymes have the potential to cleave all four major HBV RNA transcripts and to block the HBV lifecycle by cleavage of the pregenomic RNA. A number of the screened ribozymes demonstrate activity in cell culture systems, as measured by decreased levels of HBV surface antigen, HBV e antigen and HBV DNA. In addition, a lead anti-HBV ribozyme maintains activity against a lamivudine-resistant HBV variant in cell culture. Treatment of HBV transgenic mice with lead anti-HBV ribozymes significantly reduced viraemia compared with saline-treated animals and was as effective as treatment with lamivudine. In conclusion, the therapeutic use of a ribozyme alone or in combination with current therapies (lamivudine or interferons) may lead to improved HBV therapy.
Dyskinesias represent a debilitating complication of levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). While we recently demonstrated that levodopa-induced dyskinesia results from increased dopamine D(1) receptor-mediated transmission, we also questioned the possible role of subcellular localization of D(1) and D(2) receptors in mediating these effects as we previously showed that D(1) receptors undergo differential trafficking in striatal neurons of non-dyskinetic PD patients. Taking advantage of a monkey brain bank, we here report changes affecting the cellular and subcellular distribution of D(1) and D(2) dopamine receptors within the striatum of three experimental groups: normal, parkinsonian and dyskinetic L-dopa-treated parkinsonian animals. Our studies at both light and electron microscopy levels show a recruitment of D(1) receptor at the plasma membrane of striatal neurons in the parkinsonian animals and a strong increase of D(1) expression both at the membrane and in cytoplasm of dyskinetic animals, whereas D(2) receptor distribution is only modestly affected in all conditions. Our results rule out the hypothesis of a pathological overinternalization of dopamine receptors in levodopa-induced dyskinesia but raise the possibility for involvement of D(1) receptors in the priming phenomenon through massive and sudden internalization in response to the first ever administration of L-dopa and for an altered homologous desensitization mechanism in dyskinesia leading to an increased availability of D(1) receptors at membrane. Further experiments including parkinsonian monkeys chronically treated with L-dopa that show no dyskinesia and parkinsonian monkeys treated only once with L-dopa are now necessary to confirm our hypothesis.
Twenty-five patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with D-penicillamine were retrospectively reviewed for signs of drug intolerance. Nine patients (36%) developed adverse drug reactions, the most common of which was proteinuria in six patients (24%). Comparative analysis of patients with and without penicillamine-induced proteinuria revealed the only significant correlate to be a previous history of gold nephropathy. Five (83%) of six patients who developed penicillamine-induced proteinuria had had gold-induced proteinuria; in contrast, only three (20%) of 19 who tolerated penicillamine had prior gold-induced proteinuria (p less than .01). HLA typing performed in five of the six patients with penicillamine nephropathy revealed DRw4 at a prevalence less than that expected for a population with rheumatoid arthritis, with DRw3 and/or B8 present in four patients. Further studies are in progress to determine whether a genetic predisposition is present. These data suggest that cautious observation is warranted in rheumatoid patients receiving D-penicillamine who have a prior history of gold nephropathy.
Estrogens play a crucial role in the development and evolution of human breast cancer. However, it is still unclear whether estrogens are carcinogenic to the human breast. There are three mechanisms that have been considered to be responsible for the carcinogenicity of estrogens: receptor-mediated hormonal activity, a cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolic activation, which elicits direct genotoxic effects by increasing mutation rates, and the induction of aneuploidy by estrogen. To fully demonstrate that estrogens are carcinogenic in the human breast through one or more of the mechanisms explained above it will require an experimental system in which, estrogens by itself or one of the metabolites would induce transformation phenotypes indicative of neoplasia in HBEC in vitro and also induce genomic alterations similar to those observed in spontaneous malignancies. In order to mimic the intermittent exposure of HBEC to endogenous estrogens, MCF-10F cells that are ERalpha negative and ERbeta positive were first treated with 0, 0.007, 70 nM and 1 microM of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)), diethylstilbestrol (DES), benz(a)pyrene (BP), progesterone (P), 2-OH-E(2), 4-hydoxy estradiol (4-OH-E(2)) and 16-alpha-OH-E(2) at 72 h and 120 h post-plating. Treatment of HBEC with physiological doses of E(2), 2-OH-E(2), 4-OH-E(2) induce anchorage independent growth, colony formation in agar methocel, and reduced ductulogenic capacity in collagen gel, all phenotypes whose expression are indicative of neoplastic transformation, and that are induced by BP under the same culture conditions. The presence of ERbeta is the pathway used by E(2) to induce colony formation in agar methocel and loss of ductulogenic in collagen gel. This is supported by the fact that either tamoxifen or the pure antiestrogen ICI-182,780 (ICI) abrogated these phenotypes. However, the invasion phenotype, an important marker of tumorigenesis is not modified when the cells are treated in presence of tamoxifen or ICI, suggesting that other pathways may be involved. Although we cannot rule out the possibility, that 4-OH-E(2) may interact with other receptors still not identified, with the data presently available the direct effect of 4-OH-E(2) support the concept that metabolic activation of estrogens mediated by various cytochrome P450 complexes, generating through this pathway reactive intermediates that elicit direct genotoxic effects leading to transformation. This assumption was confirmed when we found that all the transformation phenotypes induced by 4-OH-E(2) were not abrogated when this compound was used in presence of the pure antiestrogen ICI. The novelty of these observations lies in the role of ERbeta in transformation and that this pathway can successfully bypassed by the estrogen metabolite 4-OH-E(2). Genomic DNA was analyzed for the detection of micro-satellite DNA polymorphism using 64 markers covering chromosomes (chr) 3, 11, 13 and 17. We have detected loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in ch13q12.2-12.3 (D13S893) and in ch17q21.1 (D17S800) in E(2), 2-OH-E(2), 4-OH-E(2), E(2) + ICI, E(2) + tamoxifen and BP-treated cells. LOH in ch17q21.1-21.2 (D17S806) was also observed in E(2), 4-OH-E(2), E(2)+ICI, E(2)+tamoxifen and BP-treated cells. MCF-10F cells treated with P or P+E(2) did not show LOH in the any of the markers studied. LOH was strongly associated with the invasion phenotype. Altogether our data indicate that E(2) and its metabolites induce in HBEC LOH in loci of chromosomes 13 and 17, that has been reported in primary breast cancer, that the changes are similar to those induced by the chemical carcinogen (BP) and that the genomic changes were not abrogated by antiestrogens.
Formaldehyde, an indoor air pollutant, is known to be an irritant and an etiologic factor in occupational asthma. An epidemiologic study suggests that it may also increase the risk of childhood asthma for concentrations above 60 microg/m(3).
To evaluate the influence of pre-exposure to low-dose formaldehyde (100 microg/m(3) in 30 min according to the World Health Organization's recommended maximum value for indoor environments) on bronchial response to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.
Nineteen asthmatic subjects were included. Each subject underwent a mite allergen bronchial challenge test immediately after a standardized exposure in a chamber to formaldehyde or air (random order). Induced sputum were collected 24 h before and after mite challenge.
After formaldehyde inhalation, patients developed an immediate bronchial response at a significantly lower dose of mite allergen than after air exposure (the geometric mean PD(20) for Der p 1 was 34.3 ng after formaldehyde and 45.4 ng after placebo, P = 0.05). The late-phase reaction, expressed as the maximum fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) from baseline, was significantly higher after formaldehyde (15%vs 11%, P = 0.046).
Our study demonstrated that exposure to low levels of formaldehyde significantly enhanced bronchial responsiveness to mite allergen in mite-sensitized subjects with asthma.
Recently, we reported that naltrexone at 150 mg/day significantly decreased cocaine and alcohol use for men but not women with co-occurring cocaine and alcohol dependence. The present study is an exploratory investigation of predictors that explain the different gender responses to naltrexone, with a particular focus on differential predictors of treatment attrition. No significant predictors were associated with treatment discontinuation in men. Women, however, were more likely to discontinue treatment when reporting severe pre-treatment psychiatric problems or nausea while in treatment. Further research on the impact of pre-treatment and in-treatment gender differences with naltrexone is warranted.
To determine the effects of phenylephrine and dobutamine on repolarization lability in patients with genotyped long QT syndrome (LQTS).
Between December 1998 and August 2000, 23 patients with genotyped LQTS (13 LQT1, 7 LQT2, and 3 LQT3) and 16 controls underwent electrocardiographic stress testing at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Aperiodic repolarization lability was quantified from digitized electrocardiograms recorded during catecholamine stress testing with phenylephrine and dobutamine. T-wave lability was quantified as a root-mean-square of the differences between corresponding signal values of subsequent beats. The magnitude of aperiodic T-wave lability was quantified by using a newly derived T-wave lability index (TWLI).
The TWLI was significantly greater in patients with LQTS than in controls (0.0945 +/- 0.0517 vs 0.0445 +/- 0.0123; P < .003). Marked T-wave lability (TWLI > or = 0.095) was detected in all 3 LQTS genotypes (10/23) but in no controls (P < .003). There was no correlation between the TWLI and the baseline corrected QT interval. All high-risk patients having either a history of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or syncope had a TWLI of 0.095 or greater.
Beat-to-beat nonalternating T-wave lability occurs in LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3 patients during catecholamine provocation and is associated with a history of prior cardiac events. The quantification of this novel phenomenon may assist in identifying LQTS patients with increased risk of sudden cardiac death.
