The aim of the study was to investigate the lipid peroxidation levels, nitrite formation, GABAergic and glutamatergic receptor densities in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum of Wistar rats after seizures and status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine. The control group was treated with 0.9% saline and sacrificed 1 h after the treatment. One group of rats was administered with pilocarpine (400 mg/kg sc) and sacrificed 1 h after treatment. The result shows that pilocarpine administration and the resulting SE produced a significant increase of lipid peroxidation level in the hippocampus (46%), striatum (25%) and frontal cortex (21%). In nitrite formation, increases of 49%, 49% and 75% in hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex, respectively, was observed. Pilocarpine treatment induced down-regulation of GABAergic receptors in the hippocampus (38%), striatum (15%) and frontal cortex (11%). However, with regard to glutamatergic receptor densities, increases in the hippocampus (11%), striatum (17%) and frontal cortex (14%) was observed during the observation period. These results show a direct evidence of lipid peroxidation and nitrite formation during seizure activity that could be responsible for the GABAergic and glutamatergic receptor concentration changes during the establishment of SE induced by pilocarpine.
Lithium has been the gold standard in the treatment of bipolar disorder (BPD) for 60 y. Like lithium, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibitors display both antimanic-like and antidepressant-like effects in some animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms of both lithium and GSK-3 inhibitors remain unclear. Here we show that the GSK-3 inhibitor AR-A014418 regulated alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA)-induced GluR1 and GluR2 internalization via phosphorylation of kinesin light chain 2 (KLC2), the key molecule of the kinesin cargo delivery system. Specifically, AMPA stimulation triggered serine phosphorylation of KLC2 and, subsequently, the dissociation of the GluR1/KLC2 protein complex. This suggests that GSK-3 phosphorylation of KLC2 led to the dissociation of AMPA-containing vesicles from the kinesin cargo system. The peptide TAT-KLCpCDK, a specific inhibitor for KLC2 phosphorylation by GSK-3beta, reduced the formation of long-term depression. Furthermore, the TAT-KLCpCDK peptide showed antimanic-like effects similar to lithium's on amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, a frequently used animal model of mania. It also induced antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension and forced swim tests, two commonly used animal models of depression. Taken together, the results demonstrated that KLC2 is a cellular target of GSK-3beta capable of regulating synaptic plasticity, particularly AMPA receptor trafficking, as well as mood-associated behaviors in animal models. The kinesin cargo system may provide valuable novel targets for the development of new therapeutics for mood disorders.
We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying phloxine B (PhB)-induced photocytotoxicity in human T lymphocytic leukemia Jurkat cells. In addition to apoptosis-related biochemical events, photo-irradiated PhB generated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), induced phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) in an oxidative stress-dependent manner and up-regulated the gene expression of interferon (IFN)-γ, an inducer of diverse apoptosis-related molecules in activated T cells. PhB-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by N-acetyl-l-cysteine, but not by catalase, indicating that ROS generation occurred intracellularly, and by SP600125 and AG490, specific inhibitors of JNK and IFN-γ signaling, respectively, confirming their roles in the apoptotic pathway. IFN-γ up-regulation was also inhibited by SP600125, indicating that it was downstream of JNK activation. These results suggest that PhB-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells partially involves the intracellular oxidative stress-sensitive and T cell-specific IFN-γ pathway. These data present a novel insight into the mechanisms of photocytotoxicity induced by artificial food colorants in human T lymphocytic leukemia cells.
While chewing and grinding movements have been observed in amphetamine addicts, recognition and management of this problem have rarely been highlighted. Botulinum toxin (BTX) has previously been demonstrated to be effective for bruxism associated with movement disorders, such as cranial-cervical dystonia. However, there is little information on its use in tardive bruxism. Here we report an amphetamine addict who presented with medically intractable bruxism, and discuss its pathophysiology and successful treatment with BTX.
This study was designed to assess the effect of i.v. treatment with aminophylline (AMPH) on the risk of calcium phosphate and struvite stone formation. We administered AMPH in doses of 4 mg/kg body weight in 15-min i.v. infusions to 60 infants with clinical symptoms of obstructive bronchitis with dyspnoea. During 3 hours after infusion we observed a significant increase in urine saturation with brushite, octocalcium phosphate and struvite. This rise in urine saturation may increase the risk of kidney stone formation.
Functional dyspepsia is a highly common disorder. The physiopathological mechanisms of this entity are not yet completely known and prokinetic drugs seem to be useful. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prokinetic effect of cinitapride in patients with dysmotility-like dyspepsia and delayed gastric emptying.
Nineteen patients were randomized to receive 1mg of an oral solution of cinitapride t.i.d or placebo for 4 weeks in two consecutive periods, following a crossover and double-blind design. The main variable was the mean change from baseline after 4 weeks of treatment in gastric-emptying half-time after a liquid test meal, measured by real-time ultrasonography.
At the end of treatment, the mean gastric-emptying half-time decreased with both treatments, with no statistically significant differences between them (ANOVA, p=0.8720). This decrease was greater for cinitapride than for placebo (ANOVA, p=0.0169) in patients with mild-to-moderate delayed gastric emptying. In this group of patients, cinitapride was also superior to placebo in the percentage AUC of the antral area and the percentage of days free of nausea. Cinitapride was well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to that of placebo.
Oral cinitapride is safe and effective in improving gastric emptying and symptoms in patients with dysmotility-like dyspepsia and mild-to-moderate delayed gastric emptying.
The case of a 21-year-old man with obstructive hydrocephalus who suffered multiple shunt failures is presented. The patient developed a syndrome of akinetic mutism that improved after administration of bromocriptine and metoprolol.
Previous experiments have demonstrated that serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor antagonists suppress hyperkinetic behaviors associated with dopamine (DA) D1 receptor supersensitivity in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. Since l-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID) may be mediated by over-sensitive D1-mediated signaling, the present study examined the effects of the selective 5-HT2A antagonist M100907 on LID behaviors in DA-depleted rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions received daily l-DOPA treatments to produce dyskinetic behaviors as measured by abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) testing. In these animals, M100907 (0.01, 0.1 or 1.0mg/kg, ip) given 30 min before l-DOPA did not alter the appearance or intensity of AIMs behaviors. Because l-DOPA induced AIMs in rats are dependent upon D1 and D2 receptor activation, a second study was performed to determine if M100907 could suppress D1- or D2-mediated rotational behaviors. Contralateral rotations induced by the D1 agonist SKF82958 were significantly reduced by pre-treatment with M100907. However, M100907 was ineffective in reducing rotations induced by the D2 agonist quinpirole. The finding that M100907 suppresses rotations induced by D1, but not D2, agonists may provide a partial explanation for the lack of effect of a selective 5-HT2A antagonist on l-DOPA-induced AIMs behaviors.
Soman (O-pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate) is a potent neurotoxicant. Acute exposure to soman causes acetylcholinesterase inhibition, resulting in excessive levels of acetylcholine. Excessive acetylcholine levels cause convulsions, seizures, and respiratory distress. The initial cholinergic crisis can be overcome by rapid anticholinergic therapeutic intervention, resulting in increased survival. However, conventional treatments do not protect the brain from seizure-related damage, and thus, neurodegeneration of soman-sensitive brain areas is a potential postexposure outcome. We performed gene expression profiling of the rat hippocampus following soman exposure to gain greater insight into the molecular pathogenesis of soman-induced neurodegeneration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with the oxime HI-6 (l-(((4-aminocarbonyl)pyridinio)methoxyl)methyl)-2-((hydroxyimino)methyl)-pyridinium dichloride; 125 mg/kg, ip) 30 min prior to challenge with soman (180 microg/kg, sc). One minute after soman challenge, animals were treated with atropine methyl nitrate (2.0 mg/kg, im). Hippocampi were harvested 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 h after soman exposure and RNA extracted to generate microarray probes for gene expression profiling. Principal component analysis of the microarray data revealed a progressive alteration in gene expression profiles beginning 1 h postexposure and continuing through 24 h postexposure. At 48 h to 168 h postexposure, the gene expression profiles clustered nearer to controls but did not completely return to control profiles. On the basis of the principal component analysis, analysis of variance was used to identify the genes most significantly changed as a result of soman at each postexposure time point. To gain insight into the biological relevance of these gene expression changes, genes were rank ordered by p-value and categorized using gene ontology-based algorithms into biological functions, canonical pathways, and gene networks significantly affected by soman. Numerous signaling and inflammatory pathways were identified as perturbed by soman. These data provide important insights into the molecular pathways involved in soman-induced neuropathology and a basis for generating hypotheses about the mechanism of soman-induced neurodegeneration.
To compare the relative risks and benefits of several clinical strategies for managing patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.
Five recent randomized controlled trials of warfarin in atrial fibrillation, 6 randomized controlled trials of quinidine, and 13 longitudinal studies of low-dose amiodarone were used. A MEDLINE search was also done (1966 to present).
A Markov decision analysis model was used to assess outcomes in large, hypothetical cohorts of patients with atrial fibrillation followed from 65 to 70 years of age within four clinical strategies: 1) no treatment; 2) warfarin; 3) electrical cardioversion followed by quinidine to maintain normal sinus rhythm; and 4) electrical cardioversion followed by low-dose amiodarone.
IN this hypothetical cohort, fewer patients had disabling events with amiodarone (1.4%) than with quinidine (1.8%), warfarin (2.6%), or no treatment (7.4%). Amiodarone appeared to be associated with the lowest 5-year mortality (13.6%) when compared with warfarin (14.4%), quinidine (15.2%), and no treatment (18.2%). In terms of quality-adjusted life-years, amiodarone had the highest expected value (4.75 years), followed by warfarin (4.72 years), quinidine (4.68 years), and no treatment (4.55 years). Amiodarone remained the preferred strategy using the most plausible scenarios of risks associated with atrial fibrillation. Choices among warfarin, quinidine, and no treatment depended on estimates of bleeding rates with warfarin, stroke rates after discontinuing warfarin, quinidine-related mortality, and the quality of life with warfarin.
Cardioversion followed by low-dose amiodarone to maintain normal sinus rhythm appears to be a relatively safe and effective treatment for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.
Humans are exposed to metals from industry, the environment and from wear debris from worn orthopaedic joint replacements. Patients exposed to worn cobalt chrome hip replacements show an increase of chromosome aberrations in the bone marrow adjacent to the implant and an increase of chromosome translocations and aneuploidy in the peripheral blood. This study has tested whether particles of surgical cobalt chrome alloy are able to induce similar DNA damage and chromosome aberrations in human cells in vitro. Because increasingly young patients are receiving hip replacements it has also tested whether the response is altered at different cellular age in vitro. Primary human fibroblasts, were tested at different pre senescent population doublings (PD10 (young) and PD35 (older)) to particles of cobalt chrome alloy for up to 15 days. As in patients there was an increase of aneuploidy, chromosome translocations and DNA damage after exposure to the cobalt chrome particles in vitro. The overall level of DNA damage and numerical and structural aberrations was approximately the same in young and older cells. However, the cellular reaction to the DNA damage was different. Older cells showed a greater loss of viability and induction of senescence and a lesser rate of mitosis and cell growth than young cells. They showed less change in transcription, particularly of p38 and caspase 10 mRNA levels, than young cells. They showed more complex aneuploidy in association with unseparated or prematurely separated chromatids. This study suggests that at least part of the chromosome changes in patients with worn implants may be due to direct effects of the metal wear particles from the implant. It would be of interest to test whether the altered reaction of the human cells at different in vitro age might correspond with a different incidence of chromosome aberrations in patients at different ages.
Stuporous states induced by sodium valproate (VPA) are accompanied by an isolated marked hyperammonemia. In reality, hyperammonemia occurs after administration of VPA even in the absence of neurological complications. The hyperammonemia is of purely renal origin and results from modifications in glutamine metabolism, this compound being the main precursor of amino acid neurotransmitters. Combined administration of VPA and phenobarbitone increases the level of hyperammonemia due to lack of detoxification by the liver of the excess of ammonia produced by the kidneys. The anatomical site of origin of the ammoniogenesis, and its intensity, were studied in two patients with a history of stuporous states during combined VPA-phenobarbitone treatment. A single injection of VPA at a later date when they were being treated by combined phenobarbitone-carbamazepine therapy, induced disturbances in ammonia metabolism which did not differ qualitatively from those observed when intolerance to VPA is lacking. It is therefore not possible to rely on simple biological tests to detect patients at risk. Correlation is also lacking between the degree of hyperammonemia and disorders of vigilance. Ammonia does not therefore appear to be the only factor responsible for neurological complications and the role of other factors must be investigated. These include: disturbances of metabolism of inhibitory and excitatory aminoacid neurotransmitters, the condition of the cerebral parenchyma, and the excitatory effect of sodium valproate which could act to varying degrees in synergy with the hyperammonemia to provoke a stuporous state.
Diminished mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic capacity are associated with reduced longevity. We tested whether resveratrol (RSV), which is known to extend lifespan, impacts mitochondrial function and metabolic homeostasis. Treatment of mice with RSV significantly increased their aerobic capacity, as evidenced by their increased running time and consumption of oxygen in muscle fibers. RSV's effects were associated with an induction of genes for oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis and were largely explained by an RSV-mediated decrease in PGC-1alpha acetylation and an increase in PGC-1alpha activity. This mechanism is consistent with RSV being a known activator of the protein deacetylase, SIRT1, and by the lack of effect of RSV in SIRT1(-/-) MEFs. Importantly, RSV treatment protected mice against diet-induced-obesity and insulin resistance. These pharmacological effects of RSV combined with the association of three Sirt1 SNPs and energy homeostasis in Finnish subjects implicates SIRT1 as a key regulator of energy and metabolic homeostasis.
We have reported that pica, kaolin ingestion behavior, correlates with nausea and vomiting in rats and the amount of kaolin intake is related to the severity of symptoms. However, the time course of the behavior is still unclear, because kaolin intake has been measured 24h after administration of an emetic stimulus. It is quite difficult and troublesome to determine kaolin intake manually at short time intervals without affecting the animal's behavior. In the present study, we investigated the time course of radiation or chemotherapeutic agent-induced pica in rats using an automatic feeding monitoring system (FDM700SW).
Rats received total body X-ray irradiation (4 Gy), or i.p. administration of cisplatin (6 mg/kg) or cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) with or without pretreatment of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, granisetron (0.1mg/kg, i.p.), then their kaolin and food intake were monitored hourly for 24h after the emetic stimuli.
Total body irradiation and i.p. injection of cisplatin or cyclophosphamide induced pica within 3h of the administration and the pica persisted for 12, 8 and 16 h after the emetic stimuli, respectively. Granisetron delayed the latency and inhibited the amount of kaolin intake. X-ray and chemotherapeutic agents induced anorexia in all rats, but anorexia was not recovered by pretreatment with granisetron.
These results suggested that both the latency and the duration of pica are similar to the clinical evidence of radiation or chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in human patients and this monitoring system is useful to evaluate the emetogenic potential of drugs and other medical intervention in preclinical studies.
L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS) was administered to six parkinsonian patients for the treatment of gait related akinesia which was refractile to L-DOPA treatment. One responded with marked improvement and one with only mild improvement. Although number of patients who respond markedly to this noradrenaline precursor, L-DOPS, is limited, L-DOPS was felt to be the most effective treatment modality for L-DOPA refractile gait related akinesia and L-DOPA related orthostatic hypotension.
The distribution of 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) activity in the tissues of the sheep differs from that of gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). Nevertheless, both enzymes are released into the plasma of sheep which have been infected with Fasciola hepatica or in which the bile duct has been ligated. In a sheep dosed with sporidesmin, a fungal toxin which damages the biliary tract, there was an increase in GGT activity in the plasma and urine but no change in 5'-NT activity. Neither enzyme was released into the plasma or urine of sheep dosed with carbon tetrachloride. In sheep with renal tubular necrosis and hepatocellular necrosis caused by dosage with hexachlorobutadiene, both enzymes were released into the plasma, and GGT, but not 5'-NT activity was found in urine. In sheep with tubular necrosis of the kidney caused by the administration of mercuric chloride, GGT activity, but not 5'-NT, increased in the plasma and urine.
The present study examined cellular effects of the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine on blood cells of treated patients with and without clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CA). Blood from one patient who commenced clozapine treatment was examined at weekly intervals for 128 days. Olanzapine-treated (n = 5) and polymedicated (n = 14) schizophrenic patients, as well as healthy subjects (n = 19) and septic shock patients (n = 8), were studied for comparison. We observed dramatically increased numbers of native neutrophils stained for superoxide anion production (P < or = 0.005, n = 10) and significantly elevated expression levels of the proapoptotic genes p53 (P < or = 0.020), bax alpha (P < or = 0.001), and bik (P < or = 0.002) in all tested non-CA patients (n = 19) and CA patients (n = 4). In non-CA patients, the expression of these genes did not correlate to the percentage of apoptotic neutrophils (2.0% +/- 1.3%), but in CA patients about 37% of the neutrophils show morphologic signs of apoptosis (P < or = 0.001). Under G-CSF therapy of CA, the number of apoptotic neutrophils and the expression of the proapoptotic genes decreased significantly. In conclusion, high production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils of clozapine-treated patients, together with increased expression of proapoptotic genes, suggests that neutrophils are predisposed to apoptosis in schizophrenic patients under clozapine therapy. The correlation between drug and proapoptotic markers was highest for clozapine and bax alpha as well as superoxide anion radicals. This indicates oxidative mitochondrial stress in neutrophils of clozapine-treated patients which probably contributes to the induction of apoptosis and sudden loss of neutrophils and their precursors in CA patients.
Gender differences in incidence of cardiac arrhythmias have been documented. It is generally believed that cardiac pathology provides an arrhythmogenic substrate but that a trigger such as sympathetic nervous system activation is required to initiate arrhythmias. This study was done to determine whether there is a sex difference in susceptibility to epinephrine-induced arrhythmias in healthy rats without preexisting pathology and to determine whether gonadal hormones play a role in development of arrhythmias. Untreated, sham-operated, and gonadectomized male and female rats were anesthetized and given IV boluses of epinephrine. ECG, heart rate, and blood pressure were measured continuously for 1 minute and intermittently over a period of 30 minutes. Male rat hearts have a higher occurrence and frequency of epinephrine-induced premature ventricular contractions, missed beats, and blocks than female rat hearts. Ovariectomy increases arrhythmias, thereby abolishing the female advantage. Castration has no effect on occurrence and frequency of premature ventricular contractions but attenuates missed beats and blocks. Sex differences and effect of gonadectomy on epinephrine-induced alterations in heart rate and blood pressure implicate baroreceptor reflex in the dimorphic arrhythmogenic response. Male rat hearts are more susceptible than female hearts to epinephrine-induced arrhythmias, and gonadal hormones play a role in this disparity.
Recently, lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone were found to result in superior overall survival compared to lenalidomide and high dose dexamethasone. The immune suppressive effects of dexamethasone can antagonize lenalidomide immunomodulatory activity and may explain this observation. We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the single agent activity of lenalidomide in newly diagnosed myeloma. Records of patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma treated with single agent lenalidomide at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Roswell Park Cancer Institute were reviewed. Data were collected on disease characteristics, demographics, and treatment outcomes. Responses were assessed as per the International Myeloma Working Group criteria. From March 2007 to July 2009, 17 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were treated with single agent lenalidomide at both institutions. The median age was 70 years (range 46-84 years). Lenalidomide was generally well tolerated and no grade 4 hematologic toxicities were noted. The overall response rate (> or =partial remission) to lenalidomide alone was 47% at a median follow-up of 7 months (range 1-26). This experience suggests that lenalidomide alone can induce an anti-myeloma effect in previously untreated patients who are considered poor candidates for concurrent dexamethasone.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease where environmental factors act on genetically predisposed individuals. Although only 5% of PD manifestations are associated with specific mutations, majority of PD cases are of idiopathic origin, where environment plays a prominent role. Concurrent exposure to Paraquat (PQ) and Maneb (MB) in rural workers increases the risk for PD and exposure of adult mice to MB/PQ results in dopamine fiber loss and decreased locomotor activity. While PD is characterized by neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, we previously showed that accumulation of α-synuclein in the limbic system contributes to neurodegeneration by interfering with adult neurogenesis.
We investigated the effect of pesticides on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in two transgenic models: Line 61, expressing the human wild type SNCA gene and Line LRRK2(G2019S), expressing the human LRRK2 gene with the mutation G2019S. Combined exposure to MB/PQ resulted in significant reduction of neuronal precursors and proliferating cells in non-transgenic animals, and this effect was increased in transgenic mice, in particular for Line 61, suggesting that α-synuclein accumulation and environmental toxins have a synergistic effect. We further investigated the transcription of 84 genes with direct function on neurogenesis. Overexpresion of α-synuclein resulted in the downregulation of 12% of target genes, most of which were functionally related to cell differentiation, while LRRK2 mutation had a minor impact on gene expression. MB/PQ also affected transcription in non-transgenic backgrounds, but when transgenic mice were exposed to the pesticides, profound alterations in gene expression affecting 27% of the studied targets were observed in both transgenic lines. Gene enrichment analysis showed that 1:3 of those genes were under the regulation of FoxF2 and FoxO3A, suggesting a primary role of these proteins in the response to genetic and environmental cues.
We report that adult neurogenesis is highly susceptible to multiple "risk factors" for PD, including α-synuclein accumulation, LRRK2 G2019 mutation and exposure to environmental toxins. We identified specific groups of genes that are responsive to each stressor, while uncovering a novel function for Fox transcription factors in PD.
To examine the effects of bilobalide on nitric oxide-induced neurotoxicity in pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cells (PC12 cells).
PC12 cell survival was monitored by LDH release and 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were measured based on their abilities to inhibit the oxidation of epinephrine by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system or to decompose H2O2 respectively. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured by a fluorometric assay to indicate the lipid peroxidation.
3-Morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1, 50-300 mumol.L-1) induced PC12 cell damage. After the cells had been pretreated with 10 mumol.L-1 bilobalide for 24 h, the cell viability was increased to 91% +/- 30% from 52% +/- 14% in SIN-1 alone group. Moreover, the activities of SOD and CAT were increased after cells were treated with bilobalide.
The NO-induced neurotoxicity can be protected by bilobalide in PC12 cells. The bilobalide-induced increase in SOD and CAT activities may serve as one of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of bilobalide.
