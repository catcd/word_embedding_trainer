To analyse the mechanisms of the antispasmodic action of alverine, the effects of this drug on the spontaneous motility and nervous control of the proximal colon of the rabbit were studied in vivo. The electrical activity of the colonic smooth muscle was recorded using extracellular electrodes. The parasympathetic efferents were activated by electrical stimulation of distal ends of the vagus nerves. Alverine given intravenously inhibits spike potentials without modifying the slow waves. Excitatory and inhibitory responses induced by parasympathetic efferent stimulations, as well as the hyperpolarization due to intraluminal distension, were also blocked after drug injection. Our results show that alverine is able to block the spontaneous contractions and the nervous control of rabbit proximal colon, indicating that this drug has powerful antispasmodic effects.
The pharmacologic characterization of FR172516, a new combined calcium channel-blocking and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent, was studied and compared with amlodipine in receptor-binding assay and in vivo studies. In the binding assay, Ki values of FR172516 for calcium channel and beta-receptor were 29.3 nM and 44.1 nM, respectively. In the in vivo studies with pithed rats, FR172516 shifted the dose-response curves of isoproterenol in heart rate to the right, suggesting that this compound has a antiadrenoceptor effect in vivo. The hypotensive effect of FR172516, which could be mainly attributed to its calcium channel-blocking action, was compared with that of amlodipine in normotensive Wistar rats (NTRs), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and renal hypertensive dogs (RHDs). FR172516 showed more potent hypotensive action than amlodipine when administered intravenously to NTRs, and apparent bradycardia was seen only with FR172516. In SHRs, FR172516 showed a long-lasting hypotensive action and dose-dependently decreased heart rate, whereas amlodipine scarcely affected heart rate. In RHDs, oral administration of FR172516 once daily for 5 days decreased blood pressure without reflex tachycardia or an increase of plasma renin activity. On the other hand, amlodipine, in the dose at which hypotensive effects equipotent to those of FR172516 were observed, produced apparent reflex tachycardia and concomitant increase of plasma renin. These results indicate that FR172516 has a potent long-lasting antihypertensive effect without activating sympathetic tone by calcium channel-blocking and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking actions.
Carboplatin was introduced to the paediatric population as an alternative chemotherapeutic agent in the management of various malignant neoplasms, including sarcomas of the head and neck, in the hope that it would have fewer side effects than pre-existing agents. While many investigators have considered the ototoxicity of this drug only incidentally, others have presumed it to be of negligible importance. A recent animal model of its use has demonstrated damage to the inner hair cells of the cochlea, particularly at the basal turn, with a corresponding high incidence of hearing loss. Similarly, 11 of 22 patients who received this agent at the Hospital for Sick Children over the past 2 years demonstrated a sensorineural hearing loss in the 4 to 12 kHz range. This complication occurred as early as after the first dose and was generally progressively worse with subsequent doses. Consequently, we recommend careful audiologic monitoring of children receiving this agent.
Most concern over the untoward effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) has concentrated on the hypertensive crises and recently on orthostatic hypotension, hypomania, and sexual dysfunction. However, little has been written about withdrawal effects when MAOIs are discontinued. This article reports an acute organic psychosis marked by visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations after abrupt discontinuation of phenelzine in two young women without previous history of psychotic symptoms.
The dose response of flurbiprofen lozenges (2.5, 5.0, and 12.5 mg) was evaluated in the treatment of sore throat. A refined version of the sore throat pain model showed that 12.5 mg flurbiprofen was significantly more effective than placebo at providing total pain relief and reducing throat soreness (p <.05). Flurbiprofen, 5.0 mg, was more effective than placebo for the reduction of throat soreness and the sensation of throat swelling (P <.05). The 2.5-mg flurbiprofen lozenge was indistinguishable from placebo. For every milligram of increase in the dose of flurbiprofen, there was an approximately 0.3-unit increase in total pain relief (P <.05). Flurbiprofen lozenges in all 3 dosages were well tolerated. Flurbiprofen lozenges are effective for sore throat at a dose between 5.0 mg and 12.5 mg; the sore throat pain model is a sensitive assay for demonstration of the dose-response relationship of an analgesic agent.
The observation of a 62 year-old woman who had been suffering from arthritis for several years and in whom treatment with high doses of acetylsalicylic acid resulted in severe acute hepatitis is reported. Clinical and serological findings led to the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by acute drug induced hepatitis.
Neurophysiologic studies have demonstrated epileptoid activity during high-dose narcotic anesthesia. The authors utilized the 14C-2-deoxyglucose method to evaluate the local cerebral glucose metabolism (l-CMRg) during high-dose fentanyl-induced epileptoid discharges as evaluated by electroencephalography (EEG) in ventilated rats. Fentanyl was administered intravenously at two dose levels (200 micrograms X kg-1, n = 5; and 400 micrograms X kg-1, n = 8). Seven unanesthetized animals served as controls. During fentanyl administration, the EEG was characterized by the appearance of isolated high voltage (greater than 100 microV) spike and polyspike and wave complexes at a frequency of one every 1-4 s, superimposed on a baseline of reduced frequency and voltage. Isolated ictal discharges (spike or sharp waves at a frequency of 12-20/s) rarely were superimposed upon the spike and polyspike activity. As a general trend, fentanyl administration induced a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease of the l-CMRg in the majority of the 37 brain structures surveyed. A clear relationship between l-CMRg and epileptoid activity appeared when the anatomic areas were grouped into functional systems. Cerebral metabolism was globally decreased in the visual and sensorimotor systems (53-78%), in the white matter structures (76-78%), and reticular formation (59-69%) with both fentanyl treatments. The largest deviation from this trend appeared in the limbic system. Here with both treatments, the l-CMRg in the claustrum, septal nucleus, amygdala, and ventral areas of CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus remained at control values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
A novel free radical scavenger, 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one (edaravone), is used for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and is protective in several animal models of organ injury. We tested whether edaravone is protective against acute liver warm ischemia/reperfusion injury in the rat by acting as a radical scavenger. When edaravone was administered prior to ischemia and at the time of initiation of the reperfusion, liver injury was markedly reduced. Production of oxidants in the liver in this model was assessed in vivo by spin-trapping/electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Ischemia/reperfusion caused an increase in free radical adducts rapidly, an effect markedly blocked by edaravone. Furthermore, edaravone treatment blunted ischemia/reperfusion-induced elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines, infiltration of leukocytes and lipid peroxidation in the liver. These results demonstrate that edaravone is an effective blocker of free radicals in vivo in the liver after ischemia/reperfusion, leading to prevention of organ injury by limiting the deleterious effects of free radicals.
The clinical and histologic effects of a new emollient cream formulation of topical tretinoin at concentrations of 0.05% and 0.01% were examined in 251 subjects with mild to moderate photodamaged facial skin in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter study. Seventy-nine percent of the subjects who received 0.05% tretinoin for 24 weeks showed overall improvement in photodamaged skin compared with improvement in 48% of the vehicle-treated control subjects. Significant reductions were found in fine wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, roughness, and laxity after 0.05% tretinoin therapy when compared with controls. In addition, histologic changes of increased epidermal thickness, decreased melanin content, and stratum corneum compaction provide independent evidence supporting clinical improvement. Side effects of erythema, peeling, and stinging were usually mild and well tolerated.
Lesions of hepatic veno-occlusive disease were found in the needle biopsy specimen of one patient suffering from chronic granulocytic leukaemia and in the liver at necropsy of a second patient suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia. The treatment included administration of 6-thioguanine which was the only relevant compound used in the first patient and which was combined with cytosine arabinoside in the second patient.
Renal complications of long-term, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus include glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. The onset and progression of these complications are influenced by underlying pathophysiologies such as hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, has been shown to ameliorate these metabolic defects. However, it was not known whether therapeutic intervention with troglitazone would prevent the onset and progression of glomerulosclerosis.
Sixty male ZDF/Gmitrade mark rats and 30 age-matched Zucker lean rats were in the study. The ZDF/Gmitrade mark rats were divided into two groups, one in which blood glucose levels were uncontrolled (30 animals) and another (30) in which blood glucose was controlled via dietary administration of troglitazone. Ten animals from each group were sacrificed at one, three, and six months into the study. The kidneys were harvested and processed for immunostaining with BM-CSPG, a marker for mesangial matrix. Images of 200 glomeruli per animal were captured using digital imaging microscopy, and the index of mesangial expansion (total area mesangium/total area of tuft) per glomerular section was measured.
The administration of troglitazone ameliorated the metabolic defects associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the glomeruli from tissue sections of animals given troglitazone showed no mesangial expansion when compared with normoglycemic control animals, whereas the uncontrolled diabetic animals showed significant mesangial expansion at all time intervals.
Therapeutic intervention with the thiazolidinedione troglitazone halts the early onset and progression of mesangial expansion in the ZDF/Gmitrade mark rat, preventing the development of glomerulosclerosis in this animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Acute renal failure secondary to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents is an uncommon occurrence, but may have serious or even lethal consequences. We present one such reaction resulting in cardiac arrest in a 59-year-old diabetic treated with indomethacin. Since presenting symptoms may be vague and unimpressive, one must consider this potential complication to make an early diagnosis and intervene appropriately. In addition when prescribing anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin, one should be cautious in patients who are predisposed to the development of acute renal failure. Risk factors that should be considered are preexistent hepatorenal dysfunction, extracellular fluid volume contraction, and concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs.
The high co-morbidity between alcohol (ethanol) and nicotine abuse suggests that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), thought to underlie nicotine dependence, may also be involved in alcohol dependence. The β2* nAChR subtype serves as a potential interface for these interactions since they are the principle mediators of nicotine dependence and have recently been shown to modulate some acute responses to ethanol. Therefore, the aim of this study was to more fully characterize the role of β2* nAChRs in ethanol-responsive behaviors in mice after acute exposure to the drug. We conducted a battery of tests in mice lacking the β2* coding gene (Chrnb2) or pretreated with a selective β2* nAChR antagonist for a range of ethanol-induced behaviors including locomotor depression, hypothermia, hypnosis, and anxiolysis. We also tested the effect of deletion on voluntary escalated ethanol consumption in an intermittent access two-bottle choice paradigm to determine the extent of these effects on drinking behavior. Our results showed that antagonism of β2* nAChRs modulated some acute behaviors, namely by reducing recovery time from hypnosis and enhancing the anxiolytic-like response produced by acute ethanol in mice. Chrnb2 deletion had no effect on ethanol drinking behavior, however. We provide further evidence that β2* nAChRs have a measurable role in mediating specific behavioral effects induced by acute ethanol exposure without affecting drinking behavior directly. We conclude that these receptors, along with being key components in nicotine dependence, may also present viable candidates in the discovery of the molecular underpinnings of alcohol dependence.
Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia may have psychiatric manifestations preceding the hematological symptoms. Although a variety of symptoms are described, there are only sparse data on the role of vitamin B12 in depression. We report a case of vitamin B12 deficiency presenting with recurrent episodes of depression.
Valproate (VPA) triples the half-life of lamotrigine (LTG), and combined use may be difficult. The adverse effect (AE) profile of this combination needs clarification.
We prospectively recorded our experience in adding LTG to VPA-containing regimens in 108 patients. Data collected included medications, seizure types and syndromes, and AEs. Patients were followed up to 27 months, until a stable dose was reached, or until LTG was discontinued. Patient management was not altered by this study. There were 60 patients with partial-onset seizures, 30 with generalized onset, and 12 with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In 37, LTG was added to VPA monotherapy, and in 71, to VPA and other drugs. The median starting dose of LTG in our adult patients was 20.8 mg/day.
LTG was added successfully in 86 (80%) patients. It was discontinued in 22 (20%): seven because of rash, seven for other AEs, and nine for other reasons. Rash occurred in 14 (13%) but caused discontinuation of LTG in only seven. We found a rash rate of 14.2% and a discontinuation rate because of rash of 8.7% among 310 patients in whom LTG was added to drug regimens not including VPA. Other AEs included fatigue (12%), gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (9%), dizziness, headache, and insomnia (3% each). Serious AEs were hallucinations (two patients), hepatic enzyme elevations (two patients), irritability (one patient), and low white blood cell count (one patient). Whether LTG was added to VPA monotherapy or polytherapy made no difference in overall AE rate.
LTG can be added to VPA with an acceptable incidence of side effects. LTG-induced rashes are no more common with VPA than with other drugs when LTG is added at very low initial dosages. Rashes are potentially serious and should be evaluated promptly.
We previously reported that vitamin E prevents apoptosis in neurons during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). In this paper, we analyzed the effects of antihypertensives as well as vitamin E, which were added to neuron cultures after reoxygenation (20% O2) following hypoxia (1% O2). When added after hypoxia before reoxygenation, vitamin E conferred significant protection to neuronal cells. It was also shown that vitamin E conferred complete protection from neural cell death when added hypoxia and again before reoxygenation. At higher concentrations of vitamin E, strong neuroprotection was observed. Moreover, we verified that pretreatment with either amlodipine, carvedilol or dipyridamole consistently prevented cell death during hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R). On the other hand, nilvadipine, a dihydropyridine-type calcium entry blocker, had no apparent effect on neuroprotection during H/R. The order of neuroprotective potency was vitamin E > dipyridamole > carvedilol > or = amlodipine > nilvadipine. In parallel experiments, we examined whether these antihypertensive agents were more effective when combined with vitamin E and dipyridamole. The results suggested that in our in vitro model system, antioxidants were the most important agents for the reduction of oxygen-free radical damage in cortical neurons. These findings suggest that amlodipine and carvedilol, with their antioxidant properties and antihypertensive activity, would be useful to inhibit neuronal cell death in the treatment of cerebrovascular stroke and neurodegenerative diseases in hypertensive patients.
The clinical course of three patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia receiving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as a single agent is reported. The first two patients were in first and second relapse of their leukemia that had occurred despite maintenance treatment with 13-cis retinoic acid after chemotherapy-induced complete remission (CR). A switch to ATRA was followed by achievement of a CR in two patients. The third patient received ATRA as first-line therapy. Two patients experienced thromboembolic complications during the phase of ATRA-induced leukocytosis. One of them died of pulmonary embolism on day 16 of treatment. The two responding patients who did not receive consolidation chemotherapy relapsed after 6 and 9 months, respectively. Increase of the ATRA dose failed to induce a new remission.
MDA is the abbreviation for methylene dianiline (p,p' diaminodiphenylmethane; 4,4'-methylenedianiline; CAS 101-77-9); and for methylendioxyamphetamine (MDMA, N, alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine; CAS 42542-10-9). While the former is used for the production of polyurethane foams, the latter is a psychometric drug, which is becoming increasingly popular in the techno scene.
We report six participants of a technoparty (1 female, 5 males, ages 17-25) who were admitted to the hospital with severe colicky abdominal pain and subsequently developed symptoms of hepatotoxicity. They had ingested an alcoholic beverage that had been spiked with a powdery substance they dubbed MDA.
All patients showed similar clinical symptoms, with an identical time course. Acute jaundice developed within 2 days after ingestion. Enzymes indicating cholestasis increased steadily over 7 days and reached peak values of 800 U/L (AP) and 380 U/L (GGT), whereas transaminases remained moderately elevated. Between days 5 and 7, all patients became febrile for one day, their body temperatures rising up to 40 degrees C. There was no evidence for hemolysis or an infectious hepatitis. Toxicological analysis revealed the presence of p,p'-diaminodiphenylmethane (4,4'-methylenedianiline) at a concentration of 130 mg/L in one of two urine extracts examined.
The analytical data indicate that the participants of the technoparty assumed the aniline-derivative, the cause of Epping Jaundice, was methylendioxyamphetamine because the same abbreviation, MDA, is used for both compounds. An overview of the acute liver toxicity of aniline derivatives is given and the possibility of amphetamine-induced liver damage is discussed.
Tacrolimus is an effective organ transplantation immunosuppressant. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare but severe complication of tacrolimus.
We report a case of tacrolimus-associated HUS and review the 15 previously reported cases.
The results of the 16 cases indicated that tacrolimus-associated HUS is more frequent in females (56.3%), with the mean age at onset of 41.3 years. Forty-four percent of cases received renal transplantations. The average time from the first tacrolimus dose to HUS onset was 7.1 months. Prevalence was between 0.14.7%. The tacrolimus trough level did not predict the prognosis. Seven patients (43.7%) had improved graft function after treatment, including anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, reduction or discontinuation of tacrolimus, switch to cyclosporine (CyA), plasma exchange (PE) and dialysis. Five patients (31.3%) died and four patients (25%) lost their graft in spite of the above treatment. Mortality risk factors for transplant recipients with tacrolimus-associated HUS included: (1) non-renal transplant recipients (100% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.034); (2) lower peak serum Cr (2.58 +/- 1.23 vs. 6.16 +/- 1.96, p < 0.002); (3) liver dysfunction (60% vs. 0, p < 0.02); (4) higher serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (3119 +/- 1019 vs. 982 +/- 522, p < 0.001). A lower platelet count carried borderline mortality risk (29500 +/- 14480 vs. 59625 +/- 25584, p = 0.057).
HUS should be included in the differential diagnosis of renal function deterioration in patients on tacrolimus post-organ transplantation. Frequent renal function monitoring and appropriate treatment should be performed aggressively to decrease morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with risk factors.
AH-1058 is a newly synthesized antiarrhythmic agent. We investigated the antiarrhythmic and electrophysiological effects of AH-1058 in experimental arrhythmia models and isolated cardiomyocytes. In the ouabain-induced arrhythmia model of the guinea pig, pretreatment with AH-1058 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) delayed the appearance of premature ventricular complex (PVC) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced by intravenous infusion of ouabain. However, disopyramide (10 mg/kg, i.v.) delayed only that of PVC, and verapamil (1 mg/kg, i.v.) failed to affect the ouabain-induced ventricular arrhythmias. In the reperfusion-induced arrhythmia model of the rat, in which 5-min coronary occlusion and 10-min reperfusion were produced, AH-1058 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) inhibited the incidence of both ventricular tachycardia (VT) and VF, whereas disopyramide (5 mg/kg, i.v.) inhibited only reperfusion-induced VF. On the other hand, a higher dose of AH-1058 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not affect the aconitine-induced arrhythmias in rats, which were inhibited by disopyramide (5 mg/kg, i.v.). We also confirmed oral activity of AH-1058 in the reperfusion-induced arrhythmia model of the rat. AH-1058, at doses of 2-4 mg/kg, dose-dependently inhibited VT and VF. Electrophysiological experiments with patch-clamp techniques revealed that AH-1058 potently suppressed the L-type Ca2+ currents in isolated cardiomyocytes of the guinea pig. These results suggest that AH-1058 is a potent antiarrhythmic drug having a Ca2+ channel-blocking action. The antiarrhythmic profile of AH-1058 is different from that of disopyramide and verapamil.
Eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093, S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide) is a novel antiepileptic drug, now in Phase III clinical trials, designed with the aim of improving efficacy and safety in comparison with the structurally related drugs carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC). We have studied the effects of oral treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate on a whole-animal model in which partial seizures can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or seizure patterns. In the animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin, the average number of seizures was 2.3+/-1.2, and average seizure duration was 39.5+/-8.4s. Pre-treatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2h before picrotoxin microperfusion prevented seizures in the 75% of the rats. Lower doses (3 and 10mg/kg) did not suppress seizures, however, after administration of 10mg/kg, significant reductions in seizures duration (24.3+/-6.8s) and seizure number (1.6+/-0.34) were found. No adverse effects of eslicarbazepine acetate were observed in the behavioral/EEG patterns studied, including sleep/wakefulness cycle, at the doses studied.
The aggravated risk on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with drugs used for stroke patients should be estimated carefully. We therefore established sensitive quantification methods and provided a rat ICH model for detection of ICH deterioration. In ICH intrastriatally induced by 0.014-unit, 0.070-unit, and 0.350-unit collagenase, the amount of bleeding was measured using a hemoglobin assay developed in the present study and was compared with the morphologically determined hematoma volume. The blood amounts and hematoma volumes were significantly correlated, and the hematoma induced by 0.014-unit collagenase was adequate to detect ICH deterioration. In ICH induction using 0.014-unit collagenase, heparin enhanced the hematoma volume 3.4-fold over that seen in control ICH animals and the bleeding 7.6-fold. Data suggest that this sensitive hemoglobin assay is useful for ICH detection, and that a model with a small ICH induced with a low-dose collagenase should be used for evaluation of drugs that may affect ICH.
This study presents 3 case reports of patients who experienced anginous pain during treatment with capecitabine. The interruption of capecitabine and sublingual or intravenous nitroglycerine treatment lead to recovery. Rechallenge of capecitabine with dose reduction of 30% lead to repeated anginous pain in 2 patients. Treatment with capecitabine had been replaced with weekly bolus 5FU-LV, without further cardiotoxicity. The literature contains data from about 50 patients who experienced cardiotoxicity during capecitabine treatment. The most frequent manifestations of capecitabine cardiotoxicity included: anginous pain in 38/53 (71.7%), arrhythmia in 6/53 (11.3%), myocardial infarction in 6/53 (11.3%). Cardiotoxicity of capecitabine lead to death in 6/53 (11.3%) patients. Risk factors for cardiotoxicity are associated with the grade 4 and the fatal outcome of cardiotoxicity (p = 0.035, p = 0.015), but not with the symptom recurrence upon capecitabine rechallenge (p = 0.18). The combination chemotherapy regimens are associated with the grade 4 of cardiotoxicity (p = 0.048), but not with the fatal outcome (p = 0.3). Rechallenge of capecitabine lead to symptoms recurrence in 10/16 patients. Neither the dose reduction of capecitabine (p = 0.18) nor the additional medical prophylaxis (p = 0.37) were important for the outcome of capecitabine rechallenge.
A feared complication of therapy with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is myelosuppression. To evaluate whether rigorous blood count monitoring is necessary, we prospectively followed the hematologic profiles of 57 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were treated with low-dose 6-MP. Most patients (97%) were treated initially with a single dose of 50 mg/day and 79% never used more than 50 mg/day. Blood counts were obtained at weekly intervals over the first month, every two weeks for the second month, and monthly thereafter in the first year. Sixteen (28%) developed mild leukopenia (white blood count < 4.5 x 10(3)/mm3). No patient had a white blood cell count < 2.8 x 10(3)/mm3 and no patient developed leukopenia prior to three months of treatment. In only five patients did the leukopenia prompt a change in 6-mercaptopurine dose. Very mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count of < 145 x 10(3)/mm3) developed in three (5%) and macrocytosis (mean cell volume > 101 fl) was seen in nine (16%). In conclusion, leukopenia was not uncommon in patients treated with low-dose 6-MP, but was not clinically significant. Leukopenia occurred no earlier than three months and as late as 42 months into therapy. Thrombocytopenia was uncommon, mild, and was not associated with apparent bleeding. Macrocytosis may occur in the absence of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies. Patients can be spared from weekly blood count monitoring when using low-dose 6-mercaptopurine treatment.
An encephalopathy characterized by confusion, stupor, and mutism frequently occurs during administration of the chemotherapeutic drug ifosfamide (IFX). We investigated two patients who developed encephalopathy during IFX infusion. Both exhibited a rapid and near-complete restoration of baseline mental status functioning concurrent with EEG improvement after administration of intravenous diazepam. We recommend an EEG and trial of benzodiazepines in patients with IFX encephalopathy.
