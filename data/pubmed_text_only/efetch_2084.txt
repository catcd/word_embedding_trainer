The dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the angiotensin II antagonist irbesartan effectively reduce blood pressure in hypertensive children.
Eligible for the open-label, randomized study were nephropathic children between 6.0 and 18 years of age with plasma creatinine <177 micromol/L, overt proteinuria, untreated arterial hypertension (systolic, 5 to 30 mm Hg; and diastolic, 1 to 15 mm Hg;>95th centile) and stable immunosuppressive treatment. The initial dose of amlodipine was 5 mg (body weight, 20 to 40 kg) and 10 mg (body weight,>40 kg), respectively, that of irbesartan, which was 75 mg (body weight, 20 to 40 kg) and 150 mg (body weight,>40 kg), respectively. The dosage was doubled if necessary.
A total of 26 children aged 6.1 to 17 years were allocated to receive either amlodipine (N = 13) or irbesartan (N = 13) for 16 weeks. Severe edema and headache occurred in two patients on amlodipine who withdrew from the study. No adverse experiences were noted in patients given irbesartan. Amlodipine [by 12 (10 to 14)/7 (5 to 10) mm Hg; median and interquartile range, respectively] and irbesartan [by 13 (9 to 16)/9 (7 to 11) mm Hg, respectively] reduced blood pressure (P < 0.01) in a similar fashion. Heart rate, plasma sodium, and creatinine did not change. Irbesartan slightly increased plasma potassium [by 0.1 (0.0 to 0.2) mmol/L; P < 0.05]. Plasma albumin and the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio were similar before and with amlodipine. On the contrary, irbesartan increased plasma albumin [by 4 (3 to 5) g/L; P < 0.03] and decreased the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio [by 242 (68 to 312) mg/mmol; P < 0.03].
The study demonstrates that in children the effect of angiotensin II antagonists on proteinuria is better than that of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.
Electron microscopic and biochemical studies revealed a salient difference in the response to toxic doses of ouabain by cultured cardiac muscle and non-muscle cells from neonatal rats. Progressive cellular injury in myocytes incubated with 1 . 10(-4)--1 . 10(-3) M ouabain ultimately leads to swelling and necrosis. The morphological damage in myocytes was accompanied by a drastic decrease in 14CO2 formation from 14C-labeled stearate or acetate but not glucose. Neither morphological nor biochemical impairments were observed in non-muscle cells. The interaction between ouabain and the cultured cells, using therapeutic doses of ouabain (i.e., less than 1 . 10(-7) M), was characterized. Two binding sites were described in both classes of cells, one site is a saturable K+-sensitive site whereas the other is non-saturable and K+-insensitive. The complexes formed between the sarcolemma receptor(s) and ouabain, at low concentrations of the drug (e.g., 7.52 . 10(-9) M), had Kd values of 8.9 . 10(-8) and 2.3 . 10(-8) M for muscle and non-muscle cells, respectively. The formation and dissociation of the complexes were affected by temperature and potassium ions.
Sixty patients (age-range one month to 14 years) with other types of epilepsy than infantile spasms were treated with clonazepam. Disappearance of seizures and normalization of abnormal EEG with disappearance of seizures were recognized in 77% and 50%, respectively. Seizures disappeared in 71% of the patients with generalized seizures and 89% of partial seizures. Improvement of abnormal EEG was noticed in 76% of diffuse paroxysms and in 67% of focal paroxysms. In excellent cases, mean effective dosages were 0.086 +/- 0.021 mg/kg/day in infants and 0.057 +/- 0.022 mg/kg/day in schoolchildren, this difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.005). The incidence of side effects such as drowsiness and ataxia was only 5%.
The prevalence of cocaine use is rising worldwide, with a resultant rise in associated pathology. Regular nasal use can cause cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions (CIMDL), which can be difficult to distinguish from ear, nose, and throat (ENT)-limited Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). Two cocaine users presented with mid-facial pain, epistaxis, and systemic symptoms. Both had nasal septal perforation, necrosis of sinus mucosa, and positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Histology was inconclusive and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs was commenced. The first patient continued to use cocaine initially, with improvement in her symptoms only on high doses of steroid. Later she stopped cocaine and this plus a switch from cyclophosphamide to mycophenolate mofetil resulted in successful symptom resolution and steroid withdrawal. The second patient denied cocaine use but having only partially responded to high-dose prednisolone and methotrexate, she admitted continued cocaine use and was lost to follow-up. Evaluation of a patient with destructive lesions of the mid-face should include enquiry about intranasal use of cocaine. Localized ENT involvement, inconsistent ANCA pattern, and atypical biopsy findings for WG should be recognized as features of CIMDL. Although cessation of cocaine use is crucial, there may be a role for immunosuppression.
Rifampin is frequently used in the treatment of mycobacterial infections. Intermittent or discontinuous therapy with rifampin has been associated with systemic symptoms referred to as the "flu syndrome" and, less frequently, acute hemolysis and acute renal failure. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman who experienced acute hemolysis and renal failure while being treated with rifampin and ethambutol for a respiratory infection caused by Mycobacterium fortuitum and M. avium-intracellulare. This patient had interrupted her therapy for periods of one week or more due to a rash and flu-like symptoms, which she ascribed to her medications. A review of the literature indicated that these adverse effects of rifampin appear to be immunologically mediated and that the symptoms of the flu syndrome may be due to mild intravascular hemolysis. Intermittent therapy with rifampin should be avoided and noncompliant patients should be given alternative treatment when possible.
Dicofol, a chlorinated pesticide showing estrogenic activity, was administered orally to virgin pregnant rats at doses of 300, 400, 500, 600, or 700 mg/kg/day for 7 consecutive days to examine its effect on blastocyst implantation. One group of rats received estradiol-17beta (10 microg) for comparison and control animals received similar quantities of olive oil. Autopsy on day 8 revealed that the olive-oil treated rats were pregnant and had a normal number of implantations and a normal duration of diestrus. Treatment with estradiol-17beta completely inhibited implantation, significantly decreased the duration of diestrus with concomitant increase in estrus. Treatment with 300, 400, or 500 mg/kg/d dicofol neither inhibited implantation nor significantly changed diestrus. Treatment with 600 mg dicofol partially inhibited implantation and significantly decreased diestrus with concomitant increase in estrus. Treatment with 700 mg dicofol completely inhibited implantation, and the uterus showed placental scars. This group exhibited a significant decrease in diestrus with concomitant increase in estrus. In all dicofol-treated rats, no significant changes were found in body weight or organ, except for a significant decrease in the weight of the uterus in groups receiving either 700 mg dicofol or estradiol-17beta. The inhibitory effect of dicofol on implantation may be due to an imbalanced estrogen-progesterone ratio, essential for implantation. The pesticide is neither tubal locking nor causes expulsion of the blastocyst from the uterus like estradiol-17beta.
A young, healthy woman underwent craniotomy for the resection of a corpus callosum arteriovenous malformation. She was slow to awaken from anesthesia and was later noted to have a total external ophthalmoplegia. Her mental status quickly improved but the total ophthalmoplegia showed only minimal improvement for 2 weeks. After ruling out possible cerebrovascular and anesthetic complications, we concluded that the oculomotor impairment was due to postoperative toxic levels of Dilantin. Toxic Dilantin levels are known to rarely produce total ophthalmoplegia. In previously reported cases, this has always resolved with normalization of the serum Dilantin levels. This case represents the first report of Dilantin-induced ophthalmoplegia that took at least 3 months to resolve; it provides a detailed documentation of the course of ocular findings.
The Electrically Heated Cigarette Smoking System Series K (EHCSS) produces smoke through the controlled electrical heating of tobacco. Evaluation of the EHCSS was accomplished by comparison with commercial and reference cigarettes, using International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and alternative puffing regimens based on nicotine exposures measured in a short-term clinical study. Using the alternative puffing regimen and compared with conventional cigarettes on a per cigarette basis, the EHCSS had 50-60% reductions in tar and nicotine; at least 90% reductions in carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, acrylonitrile, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, hydrogen cyanide, aromatic amines, tobacco specific nitrosamines, and phenol; and least a 40% reduction in 2-nitropropane. Other important smoke constituents in EHCSS smoke were reduced as well. The in vitro studies showed similar large reductions in biological activity. Ames mutagenicity of total particulate matter (TPM) from the EHCSS was reduced by 70-90%; cytotoxicity of the TPM was reduced by approximately 82% and 65% for the gas-vapor phase. In vivo testing under ISO smoking conditions in the mouse skin painting assay demonstrated later dermal tumor onset, lower dermal tumor incidence, reduced dermal tumor multiplicity, and a lower proportion of malignant dermal tumors in EHCSS smoke condensate-exposed mice. Thirty-five day and 90-day nose-only inhalation studies in rats showed reductions in pulmonary inflammation and other biological activity, including histopathological endpoints. We conclude that under the conditions of these in vitro and in vivo studies, the EHCSS demonstrated significantly lower biological activity compared to conventional cigarettes, and may suggest the potential for reductions in human smokers.
To determine whether some patients with idiopathic hypospadias have HSD3B2 mutations, we genotyped this locus in 90 patients with hypospadias (age, 6.0 +/- 0.4 yr) and 101 healthy fertile male controls. We measured basal plasma renin activity and performed an ACTH test for determination of 17-OH-pregnenolone, 17-OH-progesterone, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androstenedione and an human chorionic gonadotropin test for determination of androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone. We did not observe a clear steroidogenic pattern suggestive of 3 beta-HSD deficiency in any patient. DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes; and exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 were amplified by PCR and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. An abnormal electrophoretic migration pattern of exon 4 was observed in five patients. Two patients had missense heterozygous mutations (S213T and S284R). In another three patients, we observed heterozygous nucleotide variants in exon 4 that did not produce a change in amino acids (A238, T259, T320). In vitro enzymatic activity was diminished by 40% and 32% in the S213T and S284R heterozygous mutations, respectively. One control exhibited a heterozygous mutation in exon 3 (V78I), which did not alter in vitro enzyme activity. In addition, we observed possible polymorphisms in intron 1 in four patients and one control. We conclude that subtle molecular abnormalities in the HSD3B2 gene may be observed in some patients with apparent idiopathic hypospadias but that this finding is uncommon.
The study of the effects of repeated amphetamine administration and withdrawal on brain reward function has relevance to both amphetamine dependence and non-drug-induced depressions.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of continuous amphetamine administration and withdrawal on brain stimulation reward thresholds, and the changes that occur with repeated amphetamine exposures.
Rats were prepared with bipolar electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus and trained in a discrete-trial reward threshold procedure. Then, rats underwent two separate periods of amphetamine administration via subcutaneous osmotic mini-pumps.
Continuous amphetamine administration was associated with lowering in brain reward thresholds and decreases in response latencies, while withdrawal was associated with threshold elevations. These effects changed with subsequent amphetamine administration and withdrawal.
The results of this study indicated that with the amphetamine administration regime used here, rats developed increased sensitivity to the effects of acute amphetamine administration and tolerance to the effects of amphetamine withdrawal.
In our non-blind comparative study, amantadine was as effective as the standard medications, benztropine and ethopropazine, in controlling drug-induced extrapyramidal signs. However, statistically significant improvement was noted a week after all the three medications. In addition, extrapyramidal signs were not completely controlled in most patients even after weeks, even though substantial improvement was noted. This indicates the limitations of the currently available antiparkinsonian medications. Amantadine produced least side effects. Therefore, it may be particulary useful in patients who may not tolerate antiparkinsonian medication with anticholinergic properties. Our clinical finding that two patients with depression improved was rather interesting and needs further exploration. In summary, anamtadine is a valuable addition to our armamentarium of antiparkinsonian drugs. The drug compared favourably with other standard medications. The problem of dissipation of the therapeutic effects over time was not studied in our trial.
Within the last decade, numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that endocrine disruptors are a possible cause for a decline in semen quality. Cypermethrin is a widely used pyrethroid insecticide, but little is known about its potentially adverse effects on male reproduction. In the present study, we investigated the effects of maternal cypermethrin exposure during lactation on testicular development and spermatogenesis in male offspring. Maternal mice were administered with cypermethrin (25 mg/kg) by gavage daily from postnatal day 0 (PND0) to PND21. Results showed that the weight of testes at PND21 was significantly decreased in pups whose mothers were exposed to cypermethrin during lactation. Maternal cypermethrin exposure during lactation markedly decreased the layers of spermatogenic cells, increased the inside diameter of seminiferous tubules, and disturbed the array of spermatogenic cells in testes of pups at PND21. In addition, maternal cypermethrin exposure during lactation markedly reduced mRNA and protein levels of testicular P450scc, a testosterone (T) synthetic enzyme. Correspondingly, the level of serum and testicular T at weaning was significantly decreased in pups whose mothers were exposed to cypermethrin during lactation. Although the expression of testicular T synthetic enzymes and serum and testicular T in adulthood had restored to control level, the decreased testicular weight and histological changes were irreversible. Importantly, the number of spermatozoa was significantly decreased in adult male offspring whose mothers were exposed to cypermethrin during lactation. In conclusion, maternal cypermethrin exposure during lactation permanently impairs testicular development and spermatogenesis in male offspring, whereas cypermethrin-induced endocrine disruption is reversible.
Acute renal failure due to ciprofloxacin has been well described. The previously reported cases have been consistent both clinically and pathologically with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN). We report a case of ciprofloxacin overdose leading to acute renal failure characterized by acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The outstanding features in the patient's renal biopsy were those of distal nephron apoptosis, best seen in plastic-embedded sections and electron microscopy. This report shows that the distal nephron can be singularly involved in acute renal failure and that electron microscopy or plastic-embedded sections may be necessary to define its involvement.
Hereditary angioedema caused by mutations in the factor XII gene is a recently described disease entity that occurs mainly in women. It differs from hereditary angioedema caused by C1 inhibitor deficiency.
To assess the clinical symptoms, factors triggering acute attacks, and treatments of this disease.
Thirty-five female patients with hereditary angioedema and the factor XII mutations p.Thr309Lys and p.Thr309Arg who came from 13 unrelated families were studied. The observation period was 8.4 years on average (range, 2-26 years).
Patients had on average 12.7 +/- 7.9 angioedema attacks per year. Recurrent facial swellings occurred in all patients; skin swellings other than facial, abdominal pain attacks, tongue swellings, and laryngeal edema occurred less frequently. Some factors that triggered angioedema attacks were trauma, physical pressure, and emotional stress. Clinical symptoms started mainly after intake of oral contraceptives (17 women) or pregnancy (3 women). Exacerbation of the symptoms occurred after oral contraceptive use (8 women), pregnancy (7 women), hormone replacement therapy (3 women), intake of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (2 women), and an angiotensin 1 receptor blocker (1 woman). Effective treatments included C1 inhibitor concentrate for angioedema attacks (6 women) and, for prophylaxis, progesterone (8 women), danazol (2 women), and tranexamic acid (1 woman). No difference between mutation p.Thr309Arg and p.Thr309Lys was found.
Facial swelling is a cardinal symptom of this condition. Estrogens may have a great influence, but this influence is highly variable. Various treatment options are available.
Drugs with nephrotoxic potential are continuously introduced into perinatal and pediatric medicine, and assessment of their relative toxicity is important. We compared different methods of assessment of renal damage during development in an attempt to establish their relative sensitivity, age and dose dependence. Newborn, 6- to 8-day-old and adult rats were treated for 7 days with intramuscular gentamicin (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg/day) or amikacin (5, 20 or 40 mg/kg/day). Renal damage was assessed by serum and urine creatinine, urine N-acetyl beta-glucosaminidase and beta 2-microglobulin, cortical sphingomyelinase in vivo and in vitro and morphologic changes in light and electron microscopy. As expected, there was a dose-dependent damage, with gentamicin being more nephrotoxic than amikacin, and with newborn rats more resistant. The light- and electron-microscopic assessment were more sensitive than all other methods, followed by urinary N-acetyl glucosaminidase and then by beta 2-microglobulin. Sphingomyelinase changes occurred only at the highest doses of gentamicin.
The cystine-glutamate exchanger is downregulated after chronic cocaine, resulting in reduced extracellular levels of nucleus accumbens glutamate. The importance of cocaine-induced loss of glutamate homeostasis is revealed by N-acetylcysteine restoring cystine-glutamate exchange and attenuating reinstatement to cocaine seeking. Another regulator of extracellular glutamate is the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1. We hypothesized that cocaine self-administration reduces GLT-1 and that GLT-1 upregulation inhibits cocaine seeking.
We measured [(3)H] glutamate uptake and protein expression of GLT-1 and xCT, the catalytic subunit of the cystine-glutamate exchanger, following cocaine self-administration and 3 weeks of extinction training. We also examined the affect of ceftriaxone (previously shown to increase GLT-1) and N-acetylcysteine treatment on the expression of GLT-1 and xCT. Ceftriaxone was also tested for the capacity to inhibit cue- and cocaine-induced relapse.
Cocaine self-administration reduced glutamate uptake and the expression of both GLT-1 and xCT. Ceftriaxone restored GLT-1 and xCT levels and prevented cue- and cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. N-acetylcysteine also restored GLT-1 and xCT levels.
These results indicate that glutamate transport and cystine-glutamate exchange may be coregulated and provide further evidence that targeting glutamate homeostasis is a potential method for treating cocaine relapse.
Thirty-eight ASA I-III patients undergoing lower abdominal operations were randomly allocated to receive either morphine (group M, patient-controlled analgesia bolus = 1 mg of morphine) or tramadol (group T, patient-controlled analgesia bolus = 10 mg of tramadol) for post-operative patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after receiving morphine intraoperatively. There were no between-group differences in the pain, sedation or vomit scores. The nausea scores were significantly higher in group T in the initial 20 h and between 32 and 36 h (P < 0.01, 0-4 and 8-12 h; P < 0.05, 4-8, 12-16, 16-20 and 32-36 h). The incidence of dizziness was also significantly higher in group T (68.4% vs. 31.6%, group T vs. group M, P < 0.05). There was no difference in the overall satisfaction. We conclude that the use of tramadol, compared with morphine, for post-operative PCA after intraoperative loading with morphine is associated with more nausea and dizziness, but with similar sedation, quality of analgesia and patient satisfaction.
Among patients receiving thiazides for hypertension, there was no reliable predictor of those who would develop significant hypokalemia (a decrease in serum potassium of at least 0.5 mEq. per L). Eighty percent of patients required 60 mEq. of potassium chloride 10 percent elixir daily for successful treatment of thiazide-induced hypokalemia. Foods containing potassium or organic anion compounds of potassium are not useful in this potentially dangerous situation.
Forty-eight patients treated with oral lithium carbonate and 20 control subjects were studied to define the causes of lithium-induced water disturbances. Measurement of plasma immunoreactive arginine vasopressin, plasma osmolality, and urine osmolality after a period of dehydration separated nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, cranial diabetes insipidus, and primary polydipsia, the three postulated mechanisms of lithium-induced polyuria. Seventeen patients had a urinary concentrating defect despite serum lithium concentrations in the therapeutic range. Ten of these patients had nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, one had results suggestive of cranial diabetes insipidus, but none had evidence of primary polydipsia. Symptoms of thirst and polyuria were poor indicators of the degree of hypo-osmolar urine. No patient had electrolyte abnormalities, and none had sufficiently severe polyuria to stop lithium treatment.
Oral challenges are used to identify alternative nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for patients who react adversely to drugs of this class, but challenge conditions often differ from those in which the drug will actually be used.
To determine whether the results of oral challenges with nimesulide or acetaminophen, using cumulative administration of a single therapeutic dose while the patient is in good health, can predict the response to multiple doses of the drug during future illness.
Follow-up interviews were conducted with 248 NSAID-intolerant subjects who had tolerated oral challenges with nimesulide and/or acetaminophen 1 to 3 years earlier. We analyzed the adverse reaction rate in light of the febrile/non-febrile nature of the condition treated and the number of doses consumed.
Nimesulide was tolerated by 115/122 (94.2%) of the patients who had tried it; acetaminophen by 71/75 (94.6%). A total of 8/159 (5%) patients had experienced reactions (seven urticarial and one asthmatic) to one or both drugs. Intolerance was unrelated to the nature of the condition treated or the number of doses administered, but all four patients who failed to tolerate acetaminophen and 3/7 of those who reacted to nimesulide had histories of chronic urticaria.
Oral challenges can reliably predict long-term NSAID tolerability in patients with previous adverse reactions to other drugs of this class, except for patients with chronic urticaria.
This is the first study investigating the effect of oxycodone in polytrauma patients. The management of pain in polytrauma patients has become a very relevant issue. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) represent the most used drugs in polytrauma patients, even though their use is associated with an increased hemorrhagic risk. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of oxycodone for the treatment of acute pain. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of oxycodone administration in polytrauma patients, with minor injuries.
15 polytrauma patients (10 males, mean age 40 +/- 13 years; 5 females, mean age 49 +/- 26 years) were admitted to the Emergency Department of the Catholic University, A. Gemelli Hospital in Rome, Italy. All patients underwent physical examination, FAST ultrasound, total body CT scanning and blood tests. Three patients had multiple costal fractures, three had pelvic fracture, two had tibial fracture, five had vertebral fractures, one patient had clavicle fracture and ulnar fracture, one patient a severe trauma of the left leg, which required amputation. Five patients also reported minor head trauma, with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) 15. All patients reported abdominal trauma, while none of them had severe thoracic or kidney damage. Patients with head trauma also underwent a second CT head scanning 12 hours after admission, which excluded the occurrence of cerebral damage. All patients were then treated with oral administration of oxycodone 10 mg two times per day (bid) for 3 days. Pain intensity, before and after the administration of oxycodone, was evaluated using a scale ranging from 0 to 10.
The mean pain score at admission was 8 +/- 0.7. All patients reported significant pain improvement after the administration of oxycodone (8 +/- 0.7 vs 1.8 +/- 0.9; p < 0.0001). A dosage increase of oxycodone from 20 to 40 mg bid was required in only one patient with a clavicle fracture. The main side effects were light-headache (5 patients), constipation (4 patients) and nausea (3 patients).
These data indicate that oxycodone is a safe and effective drug for pain relief in polytrauma patients without severe thoracic, kidney or brain damage.
We evaluated the efficacy of the addition of the lymphoblasticidal agent vincristine to standard immunosuppression in heart transplantation in a prospective randomized study of 92 patients (46 to receive and 46 to not receive vincristine) with a follow-up period of 12 months. Patients received either equine antithymocyte globulin for the first week or OKT3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) for the first 10 or 14 days after transplantation. Six to eight doses of vincristine were given over 9-12 weeks, beginning 2 days after completion of ATG or OKT3. The number of rejection episodes in the first six months posttransplantation, the percentage of patients corticosteroid maintenance-free at one year, cumulative immunosuppressive drug doses, deaths, infections, and neuropathy were followed. The addition of vincristine resulted in more patients achieving corticosteroid maintenance-free status at one year (vincristine 68%, no vincristine 38%, P = 0.01). In comparing patients at relatively high risk for rejection (those younger than 55 years and all females) with those at relatively low risk (males older than 55 years), only the high-risk vincristine-treated patients showed significantly fewer rejection episodes and a higher corticosteroid maintenance status at one year (66% vs. 32%, P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in survival (vincristine 96%, no vincristine 98%), infection, or amounts of other immunosuppressive agents used. The major side effect was neuropathy, which occurred more frequently in the vincristine-treated group (43% vs. 18%, P less than .001). We conclude that vincristine acts as an immunosuppressive agent in cardiac transplantation, particularly in patients at higher risk for rejection.
Acute lung injury leading to a systemic inflammatory response greatly increases mortality in critically ill patients. Cardiovascular management of these patients frequently involves beta-adrenergic agonists. These agents may alter the inflammatory response. Therefore, the authors tested the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic agonists alter the pulmonary inflammatory response during acute lung injury in mice.
Five-week-old CD-1 mice received continuous infusions of 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dobutamine, 6 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dopexamine, or vehicle via intraperitoneal mini osmotic pumps, followed immediately by intratracheal instillation of approximately 2 microg/kg endotoxin (or phosphate-buffered saline control). Six hours later the mice were killed, and lung lavage was performed. Interleukin-6 and -10 concentrations in lung homogenates were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Interleukin-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 mRNA was measured using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Interleukin-6 protein and mRNA significantly increased after intratracheal endotoxin (P < 0.001), and the fraction of neutrophils in lung lavage fluid increased in endotoxin-treated (41 +/- 25%) versus control mice (2 +/- 4%, P < 0.05). Treatment of endotoxic mice with dobutamine significantly decreased interleukin-6 protein (P < 0.05) and mRNA (P < 0.05) expression. Dopexamine had similar but less pronounced effects. Dobutamine decreased interleukin-10 expression, whereas dopexamine did not. In endotoxemic mice, both dobutamine and dopexamine decreased induction of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 mRNA (P < 0.05) and reduced the fraction of neutrophils in lung lavage fluid (P < 0.05).
In endotoxin-induced acute lung injury, beta-adrenergic agonists can significantly decrease proinflammatory cytokine expression, decrease induction of chemokine mRNA, and decrease the resultant neutrophil infiltrate in the lung.
