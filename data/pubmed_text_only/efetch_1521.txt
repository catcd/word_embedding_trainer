Nitric oxide may be involved in seizure phenomena even though data often seem to be contradictory. This prompted us to study the influence of nitric oxide upon electrically and chemically induced seizures. The effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine (NNA), on pentylenetetrazol-, aminooxyacetic acid-, aminophylline-induced seizures or electroconvulsive shock were evaluated. NNA was applied at 1, 10 and 40 mg/ kg 0.5 and 2.0 h before chemical seizures and at 1 and 40 mg/kg 0.5 and 2.0 h prior to electroconvulsions. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (up to 40 mg/ kg) did not affect the susceptibility of mice to pentylenetetrazol, amino-oxyacetic acid or electroconvulsions. However, NNA significantly enhanced the convulsive properties of aminophylline when applied at 40 mg/kg, 0.5 h before the test. The CD50 value for aminophylline-induced clonus and tonus/ mortality was decreased from 233 to 191 and from 242 to 212 mg/kg, respectively. However, this pretreatment also led to a significant increase in the plasma levels of theophylline. Our results suggest that differential effects of NNA on chemically-induced convulsions might in some cases be associated with a pharmacokinetic interaction.
To clarify clinical roles of sigma receptor binding affinity of neuroleptics, neck dystonia induced by microinjection of sigma receptor ligands and neuroleptics into rat red nucleus was investigated. DTG and (+)-3-PPP, putative sigma receptor agonists, induced neck dystonia in dose-dependent and reversible manner. Haloperidol and perphenazine induced dystonia in the same way as sigma receptor agonists, whereas zotepine and (-)-sulpiride did not. The rank order of potency in induction of dystonia and sigma receptor affinity of these compounds showed positive correlation. Although BMY-14802 has a high affinity for sigma receptors, it never produced dystonia by itself. On the other hand, combined injection of BMY-14802 with DTG attenuated DTG-induced dystonia. Therefore, it is suggested that typical neuroleptics such as haloperidol act agonistic and atypical neuroleptics such as BMY-14802 act antagonistic at rubral sigma receptors in the induction of neck dystonia.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that renal allograft survival is reduced in African-Americans (AAs). This posthoc racial subgroup analysis (AAs vs. non-AAs) tested whether mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) might have favorable implications for the treatment of AA renal allograft recipients.
Patients received a triple therapy regimen of corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and azathioprine (AZA) 1-2 mg/kg/day, MMF 2 g/day (MMF 2 g), or MMF 3 g/day (MMF 3 g).
AAs in the AZA group had the highest biopsy-proven rejection/treatment failure (BPR/TF) rate (57.5% vs. 43.5% for non-AAs). AAs in the MMF 3 g group showed a significant reduction in BPR/TF (57.5% vs. 24.2%, P=0.0008). BPRs were more frequent for AAs in either the AZA (47.5%) or MMF 2 g group (31.8%) than in the MMF 3 g group (12.1%), whereas rejections were reduced for non-AAs receiving either MMF dosage (AZA, 35.5%; MMF 2 g, 15.7%; MMF 3 g, 18.8%). AAs in the AZA group experienced BPR/TF earlier than AAs in the MMF 3 g group (median onset at 64 days vs. > 183 days, P=0.0012). But AAs in the MMF 3 g experienced BPR/TF the latest among the six subgroups of treatment and race. AAs had more severe rejection episodes and higher serum creatinine levels at 6 months after transplant, regardless of treatment group.
Dose-dependent prevention of acute rejection in AAs is best afforded by a dosage of MMF at 3 g/day, whereas 2 g/day provides a superior benefit/risk ratio for non-AAs. MMF at 3 g/day thus provides an improvement over conventional immunosuppressive strategies in reducing the frequency of acute rejections in this immunologically high-risk group.
Since Duchenne muscular dystrophy was attributed to mutations in the dystrophin gene, more than 30 genes have been found to be causally related with muscular dystrophies, about half of them encoding proteins of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Through laminin-2, the DGC bridges the muscle cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Decreased levels of PRiMA-linked acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) have been observed in dystrophic muscle and nerve of dystrophin-deficient (mdx) and laminin-2 deficient (Lama2dy) mice. To help explain these observations, the relative content of AChE, BuChE and PRiMA mRNAs were compared in normal and Lama2dy mouse muscle and sciatic nerve. The 17-fold lower level of PRiMA mRNA in Lama2dy muscle explained the deficit in PRiMA-linked ChEs. This would increase acetylcholine availability and, eventually, the desensitization of nicotinic receptors. Abnormal development of the Schwann cells led to peripheral neuropathy in the Lama2dy mouse. Compared with normal nerve, dystrophic nerve displayed 4-fold less AChE-T mRNA, 3-fold more BuChE mRNA and 2.5-fold less PRiMA mRNA, which agreed with the lower AChE activity in dystrophic nerve, its increased BuChE activity and the specific drop in PRiMA-linked BuChE. The widely accepted role of glial cells as the source of BuChE, the observed dysmyelination of Lama2dy nerve and its increased BuChE activity support the idea that BuChE up-regulation is related with the aberrant differentiation of the Schwann cells.
I.v. propranolol (Prop) produced sustained pressor responses in rats but not in dogs under urethane anesthesia. In the dogs there was a progressive reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in accordance with a significant heart rate (HR) reduction. Even at the i.v. dose (5 mg/kg) where vasoconstrictor response to i.v. norepinephrine (NE) is changed to the vasodilator one in rats, phenoxybenzamine could not completely suppress the NE-induced vasoconstriction in dogs. In pithed dogs, unlike pithed rats, i.v. Prop augmented neither sympathetic nerve stimulation- nor i.v. epinephrine (Epi)-induced pressor responses. Urethane anesthesia brought much higher concentrations in plasma Epi and NE in the dog than in the rat. In comparison with their respective values under the conscious state, SBP and HR of the dog were higher and those of the rat were lower under urethane anesthesia. As in urethane-anesthetized dogs, i.v. Prop elicited remarkable HR reduction accompanied by progressive hypotension in coronary-ligated rats with high sympathetic activity. Thus the reason for the absence of pressor response to beta-receptor blockage in the dog may be due to less functional significance of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation in determining the peripheral vascular tone; and also, the possibility that there may be the involvement of an inverse influence of urethane on the cardiovascular regulatory system in terms of enhancing sympathetic nervous activity in the dog and a decreasing one in the rat can not be ruled out.
Opioid-exposed infants display a wide and variable range of dysregulated neurobehavioral functioning, but the regulatory difficulties experienced by these infants outside the defined clusters of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) have not been well described and may have implications for the infant's developmental course. This study describes the neurobehavioral functioning of neonates prenatally exposed to methadone, using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), and explores the relationships between maternal factors and infant functioning. The relationship between NNNS measures, NAS severity, and need for pharmacotherapy for NAS was also evaluated. Infants who required pharmacologic treatment for NAS showed more dysregulated behavior and signs of stress and abstinence as indicated by NNNS scores, but NNNS scores were not significantly correlated with maternal methadone dose. The determination of the range of the methadone-exposed infant's neurobehavioral repertoire could guide the optimal treatment of all such infants, particularly those requiring only nonpharmacologic care.
The ligand-activated transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), is a novel inducer of adaptive Tregs. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the most potent AHR ligand, induces adaptive CD4+CD25+ Tregs during an acute graft-versus-host (GvH) response and prevents the generation of allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. TCDD also suppresses the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalitis in association with an expanded population of Foxp3+ Tregs. In this study, we show that chronic treatment of NOD mice with TCDD potently suppresses the development of autoimmune Type 1 diabetes in parallel with greatly reduced pancreatic islet insulitis and an expanded population of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells in the pancreatic lymph nodes. When treatment with TCDD was terminated after 15 weeks (23 weeks of age), mice developed diabetes over the next 8 weeks in association with lower numbers of Tregs and decreased activation of AHR. Analysis of the expression levels of several genes associated with inflammation, T-cell activation and/or Treg function in pancreatic lymph node cells failed to reveal any differences associated with TCDD treatment. Taken together, the data suggest that AHR activation by TCDD-like ligands may represent a novel avenue for treatment of immune-mediated diseases.
Pancreatic cancer is exceptionally aggressive with no long-term effective therapy. Current interventional approaches, including surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, have done little to quell the mortality associated with this malignancy. Subtraction hybridization identified a cancer-specific apoptosis-inducing cytokine gene, melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24), with a broad range of selective antitumor activity in diverse cancers both in vitro and in vivo in nude mice and recently in patients with advanced carcinomas and melanomas. Unlike most neoplasms, pancreatic cancers display innate resistance to mda-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis, which correlates with a diminished capacity to convert mda-7/IL-24 mRNA into protein. We presently demonstrate that this translational block can be reversed by treatment with agents that elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Induction of apoptosis in vitro and suppression of tumorigenesis in vivo in nude mice are induced in pancreatic cancers, irrespective of the status of their K-ras gene, only when tumor cells simultaneously express mda-7/IL-24 and are treated with a ROS-inducer, such as arsenic trioxide (ARS), N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (HPR) or dithiophene (NSC656240 (NSC)). In pancreatic cancer cells constitutively expressing mda-7/IL-24 mRNA, a single treatment with arsenic trioxide, HPR or NSC656240 induces apoptosis, which correlates with production of MDA-7/IL-24 protein. The specificity of this action is documented by the ability of ROS inhibitors, including N-acetyl-L-cysteine and Tiron, to block this killing effect. Of potential clinical significance, similar treatment of normal cells does not elicit significant changes in growth nor does it induce apoptosis. Analysis of signal transduction changes in pancreatic carcinoma cells infected with Ad.mda-7 in combination with a ROS-inducer indicate that cell death correlates with modulation of discrete cassettes of multiple signaling pathways in a pancreatic cancer cell-specific manner, supporting global signaling dysregulation as a potential mediator of apoptosis induction. These findings suggest a promising combinatorial approach for safely promoting cell death in pancreatic tumors that provides a rational framework for developing a selective and effective therapy for this invariably fatal cancer.
Because nitric oxide inhibits the synthesis and vasoconstrictor effect of endothelin-1, the effect of endothelin-1 may be enhanced under conditions of chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis. We studied the effect of chronic therapy with bosentan, a combined endothelin-A/endothelin-B receptor antagonist, on blood pressure and vascular function and structure of small arteries as well as on the reactivity of the aorta in N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertension. Six-week-old Wistar-Kyoto rats were randomly treated for 6 weeks with placebo (control), L-NAME (70 mg/kg per day), or L-NAME plus bosentan (100 mg/kg per day). The treatments were stopped 2 to 3 days before the in vitro experiments so that only the long-term effects of the drugs could be observed. L-NAME increased systolic blood pressure: bosentan did not prevent this effect although the initial blood pressure rise was delayed (P=NS versus L-NAME group). Bosentan administration did not modify the structural alteration of the resistance vessels induced by L-NAME, nor did it improve endothelium-dependent relaxation of resistance vessels or the aorta. However, bosentan therapy markedly increased endothelium-dependent contraction to acetylcholine, which was slightly enhanced by L-NAME. In contrast, bosentan inhibited aortic endothelium-dependent contractions when applied acutely in vitro. This observation, together with the increased maximal vasoconstriction to the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 after 2 weeks of bosentan administration, suggests that bosentan also interacts with the receptors mediating endothelium-dependent contractions. In conclusion, our experiments suggest a minor role of endothelin in chronic L-NAME-induced hypertension as well as in the concomitant alterations of vascular structure.
While it is generally accepted that phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC) are down-stream proteins involved in metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-related signal transduction, we still do not know which subtype of PLC or PKC is specifically regulated after mGluR5 activation. In the present study in mGluR5 wild-type (mGluR5+/+) mice, we showed induced PKCbeta2 or PKCgamma expression at the border between the stratum oriens and alveus (O/A border) at 2h during pilocarpine induced status epilepticus (SE), and in the stratum pyramidale in CA1 area at 1 day after pilocarpine induced SE; at 1 day, induced expression of PLCbeta4 in the stratum pyramidale of CA1 area was observed. Furthermore, double labeling revealed the co-localization of induced PKCbeta2 or PKCgamma with mGluR5 or with induced PLCbeta4 in the stratum pyramidale of CA1 area. These induced expression, however, were not found in mGluR5 mutant (mGluR5-/-) mice. It suggests that induced PLCbeta4-PKCbeta2/PKCgamma at 1 day after pilocarpine induced SE in pyramidal neurons or PKCbeta2 or PKCgamma in interneurons at O/A border at 2h during pilocarpine induced SE may be specifically linked to the activation of mGluR5. When compared to mGluR5+/+ mice, significant shorter latency (from pilocarpine injection to the occurrence of status epilepticus) and maintenance period (from beginning to the end of status epilepticus) for status epilepticus in mGluR5-/- mice were also demonstrated. It is possible that mGluR5 may play a negative role in initiation of status epilepticus by interacting with muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in mGluR5+/+ mice.
Shortly after the invention of nitroglycerin (NTG), it was noticed that this substance is capable of inducing a violent headache. Only recently, it became known that this was due to the release of nitric oxide (NO) by NTG. As the molecular mechanism of migraine pain remains to be determined, NTG, being pro-drug for NO, has been used to study the aetiology and pathophysiology of migraine. Such studies with NTG- and also histamine-induced headaches, have led to propose that NO may be the causative molecule in migraine pain. The evidence supporting the role of NO in migraine is discussed, e.g. substances capable of inducing experimental vascular headache do so with NO as the common mediator, while drugs with antimigraine activity inhibit NO and the cascade of intracellular reactions triggered by NO. The importance of NO as a potential initiator of the migraine attack opens new directions for the pharmacological treatment of migraine and other vascular headaches.
The relationships of cortisol with elevated blood pressure and insulin resistance are likely to be the result of a complex interplay of different mechanisms. We hypothesize that cortisol is associated with impaired microvascular function and that this contributes to cortisol-associated high blood pressure and insulin resistance. We examined 24 h urinary free cortisol excretion in 56 healthy adults (26 women). Blood pressure was assessed by 24 h ambulatory measurements. Insulin sensitivity was determined using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp technique. Skin capillary recruitment after arterial occlusion was visualized with videomicroscopy and endothelium-(in)dependent vasodilation was evaluated with iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside combined with laser Doppler fluxmetry. Men were characterized by higher urinary cortisol excretion [median (interquartile range), 162 (130-194) compared with 118 (99-156) nmol/24 h, P<0.05]. In women, but not in men, urinary cortisol excretion was associated with impaired capillary recruitment (r=-0.66, P<0.001), higher systolic blood pressure (r=0.64, P<0.001) and lower insulin sensitivity (r=-0.43, P<0.05). Urinary cortisol excretion was not associated with endothelium-(in)dependent vasodilation in men or women. Regression analysis demonstrated that capillary recruitment statistically explained 37% of the association between urinary cortisol and blood pressure in women. Capillary recruitment did not explain part of the association between urinary cortisol and insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, urinary cortisol excretion is inversely associated with capillary recruitment in women, but not in men, and capillary recruitment explains part of the cortisol-blood pressure relationship. These data suggest that, in women, impairment of capillary function mediates some of the adverse effects of cortisol and thus may provide a target to prevent such adverse effects.
A new type of topically applied drug (minoxidil) to facilitate erection is presented. Minoxidil acts directly on arterial smooth muscles via relaxation. This drug (1 ml. of a 2% solution) was studied under strict laboratory conditions in a double-blind controlled trial on 33 patients (4 with neurogenic plus arterial, 10 with neurogenic and 19 with arterial impotence) and compared to placebo and nitroglycerin (2.5 gm. of a 10% ointment). The application sites were the penile shaft (nitroglycerin) or glans penis (minoxidil and placebo). Increases in diameter and rigidity were measured with the RigiScan device and arterial flow was evaluated by conventional Doppler sonography. Side effects were considered as well. This drug proved to be more active than nitroglycerin and placebo in increasing diameter, rigidity and arterial flow of the penis. The highest activity proved to occur in neurogenically impotent patients. Fewer side effects also were found with minoxidil than with nitroglycerin. For these reasons minoxidil is proposed as a long-term therapeutic agent for organic impotence.
Two hyperactive boys who had developed motor and phonic tics during stimulant treatment reacted similarly to low doses of haloperidol and thioridazine. Neuroleptic-induced tics may be a consequence of presynaptic dopamine blockade.
Topical beta-blocker treatment is routine therapy in the management of patients with glaucoma. Therapy results in systemic absorption, however, the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified.
This trial evaluated the effect of placebo, 0.5% aqueous timolol (timolol solution) and a 0.5% timolol suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva (timolol gellan) on the 24-hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for glaucoma to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate.
Forty-three Caucasian patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with a mean (+/-SD) age of 63 (+/-8) years were randomized and crossed over in a double-masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo (morning and evening in both eyes), timolol solution (morning and evening in both eyes), or timolol gellan (morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening). On the 13th day of each period, heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical, ambulant 24-hour period.
Both timolol solution and timolol gellan reduced the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo (P < or = .001), and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime (-7.5% change in mean heart rate, -5.7 beats/min). Timolol gellan showed a numerically but not significantly smaller reduction in 24-hour heart rate, compared with timolol solution. During the night, the mean 12-hour heart rate on placebo and timolol gellan were both significantly less than on timolol solution; the difference between solution and gellan treatments was statistically significant (P = .01).
Both timolol solution and timolol gellan decrease the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo. This response was most pronounced during the active daytime period. These data quantify the modest bradycardia associated with ophthalmic beta-blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for glaucoma. Although exercise performance was not assessed in this trial, reductions of this magnitude should not have substantial clinical consequences.
Administration of amantadine was associated with psychotic decompensations in two schizophrenic patients being maintained on concomitant neuroleptic medication. Despite a postulated dopaminergic mechanism, there seems to have been only one previous report of amantadine's precipitating psychosis in a schizophrenic patient.
Very little is currently known about mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis. In the present study, metastasis-associated proteomes were separated and identified by comparative proteomic analysis, and the metastasis-related function of candidate protein interleukin-18 (IL-18) was further elucidated. First, a pair of highly and poorly metastatic sublines (termed PLA801D and PLA801C, respectively), originating from the same parental PLA801 cell line, was identified by spontaneous tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo and characterized by metastatic phenotypes analysis in vitro. Subsequently, a proteomic approach was used to compare the protein expression profiles between PLA801C and PLA801D sublines. Eleven proteins were identified and further verified by one-dimensional Western blotting, Northern blot and/or semiquantitative reverse transciptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. Compared with those in poorly metastatic PLA801C subline, cytokeratin 18, tissue transglutaminase, Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1, tropomyosin, fibroblast type, IL-18 and annexin I were significantly up-regulated, while protein disulfide isomerase, heat shock protein 60, peroxiredoxin 1, chlorine intracellular channel protein 1 (CLI1) and creatine kinase, B chain were significantly down-regulated in the highly metastatic PLA801D subline. Intriguingly, all the identified candidate proteins except for CLI1 have been shown to be somehow associated with distinct aspects of tumor metastasis such as cell growth, motility, invasion, adhesion, apoptosis and tumor immunity, etc. Considering that IL-18 was present in highly metastatic PLA801D but absent in poorly metastatic PLA801C, the association of IL-18 with metastasis was further elucidated by introducing IL-18 sense/IL-18 antisense into PLA801C/PLA801D sublines simultaneously. The results demonstrated that ectopically expressed IL-18 promoted cell motility in vitro and down-regulated E-cadherin expression of PLA801C transfectants, while IL-18 antisense remarkably decreased cell invasion potency in vitro and notably increased E-cadherin expression of PLA801D transfectants, indicating that IL-18 might play a role in metastasis by inhibiting E-cadherin expression.
We have studied the effect of steroids on cell proliferation in two continuous cell lines derived from rat mammary tumors induced by 7, 12-dimethyl-benz (a) anthracene (DMBA) and N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU). These cell lines contain high concentrations of glucocorticoid and androgen receptors but no estrogen and progesterone receptors as previously shown (1). The cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring [3H] thymidine incorporation into DNA, cell number, and DNA content. Dexamethasone was found to markedly stimulate cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it was acting via the glucocorticoid receptor. The effect of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was weaker since a stimulation of [3H] thymidine incorporation was contrasted by the absence of a constant increase of cell proliferation. Progesterone partially stimulated NMU cell growth and totally inhibited the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone in both cell lines. The synthetic progestin R5020 displayed a similar activity to that of progesterone. These results show that progestins can directly modulate the growth of mammary cancer cells even in the absence of progesterone receptor by interacting on the glucocorticoid receptor. We conclude that progestins act mostly as partial agonist-antagonists of glucocorticoids in these two rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines.
Anthropometric, endocrine and metabolic variables, were examined in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO), and in normal control women. Obese women with PCO had higher plasma insulin values than non obese women with PCO, but lean body mass, glucose tolerance, plasma triglycerides and blood pressure were not different in spite of almost twice the body fat mass in the obese PCO women. However, in comparisons between non-obese PCO and control women, with equal body fat mass, the PCO women had higher blood pressure, plasma triglycerides and insulin, as well as a tendency to increased lean body mass. Both PCO groups had a high waist/hip ratio and larger abdominal fat cells than controls, indicating a preferential abdominal accumulation of adipose tissue. In comparison with abdominal adipocytes, femoral adipocytes were larger and had higher lipoprotein lipase activity in the control women, while in the PCO women these regional differences were not found. Basal and norepinephrine stimulated lipolysis were higher in the abdominal than femoral adipocytes in all groups. Substitution of the PCO women with ethinyl estradiol plus desogestrel during 6 months resulted in a regression of clinical androgenic symptoms as well as a normalization of plasma concentrations of free testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin. However, neither body composition nor metabolism were normalized. It was concluded that body fat distribution is more closely related to hypertension and metabolic derangements than total fat mass in the PCO syndrome. It is suggested that the relative paucity of femoral adipose tissue is due to a lack of specific effects of progesterone on adipocytes in this region.
Laromustine (Onrigin), under development by Vion Pharmaceuticals Inc, belongs to the sulfonylhydrazine class of alkylating agents and is in clinical development for the treatment of malignancies. Laromustine is a prodrug that yields a chloroethylating compound (VNP-4090-CE) and a carbamoylating compound (methyl isocyanate). The antineoplastic effect of laromustine is attributed primarily to the chloroethylating species, which causes the preferential alkylation of DNA at the O6 position of guanine, a lesion that results in interstrand crosslinks and, eventually, cell death. The carbamoylating species contributes to antitumor activity by inhibiting the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine transferase. Early phase I clinical trials in patients with solid tumors indicated that laromustine was associated with myelosuppression; few extramedullary toxicities were observed, indicating potential efficacy for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Phase II trials have been completed in patients with previously untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and relapsed AML. The most encouraging results were observed in patients over 60 years of age with poor-risk de novo AML for which no standard treatment exists. Laromustine is currently in phase II/III trials for AML and phase II trials for MDS and solid tumors. Laromustine appears to be a promising agent that will add to the armamentarium of drugs available to treat patients who do not respond to, or are not fit for, intensive chemotherapy, such as elderly individuals.
To evaluate the optimal schedule of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) radiosensitization in rectal cancer, we investigated the interaction between radiation and several doses of 5-FU on colon cancer cell lines based on pharmacokinetics of oral fluoropyrimidine. Cellular cytotoxicity in colon cancer cell lines, LoVo, WiDr and Caco-2 was determined, using a WST-8 colorimetric assay, after 24 h exposure to several concentrations of 5-FU and a radiation dose of 5 Gy. Cells were exposed to 5-FU 24 and 0 h before radiation. 5-FU doses were classified into three groups: uracil-tegafur (0.01-0.1 microM), S-1 (0.1-1.0 microM) and pharmacokinetic modulating chemotherapy (0.1-10 microM). In addition, the effect of 5-FU on the steady-state levels of a human excision repair cross-complementing 1 gene and cell cycle distribution were examined. Regardless of time of 5-FU exposure, all cell growth was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In Caco-2 cells, the cytotoxicity of radiation followed by 5-FU was significantly greater than that of 5-FU followed by radiation, unlike in the other cell lines. The growth inhibitory effect of radiation followed by 5-FU increased in a dose-dependent manner to reach a plateau at S-1 doses in all cell lines. In cell cycle distribution, 5-FU exposure for 24 h increased the S phase fraction in a dose-dependent manner. RT-PCR showed that 5-FU post-treatment graduallly inhibited mRNA expression of ERCC1, which may affect recombination repair efficiency, accounting for the higher tumor sensitivity. Oral fluoropyrimidines, like S-1, that can maintain a constant level of 5-FU may be an acceptable alternative radiosensitizer to protracted 5-FU infusion, when the aim of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer is locoregional control.
Primary nodular adrenocortical hyperplasia (PNAH) is a well recognized, but infrequently studied cause of paediatric Cushing's syndrome (CS).
To assess presentation, diagnosis, radiological imaging, treatment and molecular analysis of patients with childhood-onset CS due to PNAH.
Four males and two females (median age 12.9 years, range 10.9-16.9 years) were studied.
All had growth failure (mean height SDS -1.2; range -2.5-0.0), weight gain [mean body mass index (BMI) SDS 3.5; range 2.5-4.6] and clinical virilization, while five had hypertension [mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) 130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 83 mmHg]. One patient had generalized lentigines, one had a tibial chondromyxomatous cyst and two had facial freckling. One patient had a family history of primary nodular adrenocortical disease. The diagnosis of CS was based on elevation of sleeping midnight serum cortisol and urinary free cortisol excretion, and impaired suppression of cortisol on both low- and high-dose dexamethasone suppression tests (DST). All patients had undetectable plasma ACTH with absent responses of both plasma ACTH and serum cortisol to an intravenous (i.v.) corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) test. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging showed normal or small adrenals, with nodules in two patients. All patients underwent bilateral adrenalectomy, performed by open (n = 2) or laparoscopic surgery (n = 4) at a mean of 0.4 years (range 0.2-0.8 years) from diagnosis. Hypercortisolaemia was treated preoperatively by metyrapone alone 0.50-0.75 g/day (n = 4), metyrapone 0.75-1.50 g/day + o'p'DDD/mitotane 1-2 g/day (n = 1), or ketoconazole (n = 1). Adrenal histology showed nodular cortical hyperplasia with shrinkage of intervening cortical tissue and pigmentation, present in four patients. Molecular analysis of the type 1-alpha regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PRKAR1A) gene revealed a novel germline mutation in one patient. Postadrenalectomy, three patients, had catch-up growth with height velocities increasing from 3.0, 3.9 and 2.5-8.9, 8.3 and 9.0 cm/years, respectively. All six are well at a follow-up (mean 4.0 years; range 0.5-10.8 years).
PNAH was associated with cushingoid features, virilization and hypertension with a lack of cortisol suppression on high DST, undetectable plasma ACTH and absent cortisol and ACTH responses to CRH. Adrenals were normal or small on imaging. PRKAR1A gene analysis may be helpful in the assessment of these patients.
The increased vascular permeability and pathogenic angiogenesis observed in diabetic retinopathy are induced, at least in part, by local inflammation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Therefore, inhibition of signaling from VEGF and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) is a promising approach to the treatment of this disease, as well as ocular diseases with similar etiologies, including age-related macular degeneration. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that sphingosine kinase (SK) plays an important role in cellular proliferation and angiogenesis. This study was undertaken to examine the effects of SK inhibitors on the responses of retinal endothelial cells (RECs) to VEGF and TNFalpha and their therapeutic efficacy in a diabetic retinopathy model.
The expression and function of SK in bovine and human RECs were examined by immunoblot analysis. The involvement of SK in mediating responses to VEGF and TNFalpha was examined by using pharmacologic inhibitors of SK in cellular and in vivo assays, including a 3-month streptozotocin-induced diabetic retinopathy model in rats.
SK was present and active in human and bovine RECs, and SK activity in these cells was stimulated by VEGF. Inhibitors of SK blocked VEGF-induced production of sphingosine 1-phosphate and markedly attenuated VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of RECs. In addition, SK inhibitors were shown to block TNFalpha-induced expression of adhesion proteins, suppress VEGF-induced vascular leakage in an in vivo mouse model, and reduce retinal vascular leakage in the rat diabetic retinopathy model.
Overall, these studies demonstrate that inhibitors of SK attenuate the effects of proliferative and inflammatory stimuli on RECs both in vitro and in vivo, and so could be significant therapeutics in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
Castrated male WF rats, given implants of pellets containing 5.0 mg diethylstilbestrol (DES), were given N-butyl-N-nitrosourea (NBU) in small amounts, which alone produced no mammary tumors in intact female rats. Treatment resulted in the high yield of hepatic tumors (HT), mammary tumors (MT), and pituitary tumors (PT) concurrently in each rat. If animals were further treated with prolactin, the development of HT and MT was accelerated, whereas that of PT was suppressed. None of the intact or castrated rats receiving NBU and/or prolactin developed tumors in any tissues if DES treatment was omitted. Exposure of male rats, preconditioned similarly to NBU treatment, to 200 rads of 14.1-MeV fast-neutron radiation also elicited HT, MT, and PT with an efficiency comparable to that of NBU-treated rats. These findings indicate that DES played an essential role in the whole carcinogenic process in each tissue and that castrated male rats, if conditioned properly with estrogens, are useful for the study of the carcinogenesis mechanism in these tissues.
The fluoroquinolones represent a new class of antimicrobial agents with a broad spectrum of activity. We report three cases of acute renal failure following ciprofloxacin in patients without a previous history of renal insufficiency. The average baseline creatinine was 1.1 mg/dl and rose to an average of 4.0 mg/dl during therapy. The length of antecedent ciprofloxacin therapy ranged from several days to several weeks. Other causes of acute renal failure and postobstructive uropathy were excluded. Kidney size was normal-to-increased. Gallium scans were positive in one of two patients studied. Peripheral eosinophilia developed in one case, suggesting an acute hypersensitivity reaction to the drug. The acute renal failure in all cases was non-oliguric and was completely reversed after discontinuation of ciprofloxacin. In two of the three reported cases there was an increased creatinine to BUN ratio, but increased production of creatinine (i.e., rhabdomyolysis) was unlikely with a normal serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). In addition, we performed in vitro studies which eliminated the possibility of methodological artifact. The nephrotoxicity of the quinolones has been linked to the development of crystalluria in experimental animals. However, in humans, crystalluria is unlikely and renal damage has not been noted. There have been only two previous case reports of acute renal failure due to oral ciprofloxacin therapy. In one, biopsy showed acute interstitial nephritis. We conclude that oral ciprofloxacin therapy may lead to acute renal failure secondary to tubulointerstitial nephritis characterized by an increased creatinine to BUN ratio. Patients placed on ciprofloxacin therapy need to be followed closely.
Naloxone in high doses (60--240 mg/kg i.p.) produced a dose-dependent increase in cerebellar cGMP content of mice. The rise in cGMP content reached its maximum within 5 min and was of short duration. Short-lasting episodes of clonic seizures were noted after 240 mg/kg naloxone. Low doses of naloxone (5--10 mg/kg) had no effect on cerebellar cGMP content, but markedly potentiated the increase in cGMP induced by isoniazid. On the other hand, naloxone (5 mg/kg) partially antagonized the fall in cGMP elicited by diazepam, but had only a slight effect on the action of pentobarbital (30 mg/kg i.p.). These results support the assumption proposed by other authors that naloxone exerts GABA antagonistic effects aside from the potent opiate receptor antagonistic activity.
