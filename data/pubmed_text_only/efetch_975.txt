Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have emerged as effective antihypertensive agents, it is not known how efficacious these agents are in treating hypertension-associated target organ damage.
The present study was undertaken to compare the effect of angiotensin type 1 receptor inhibition on the progression of the organ damage observed in 2 models of hypertension, namely, salt-sensitive and nitric oxide synthase inhibition-mediated hypertension. Effective (16.4 micromol/kg) and ineffective (0.8 to 4.9 micromol/kg) antihypertensive doses of candesartan cilexetil were initiated after hypertension was established. Both low- and high-dose candesartan cilexetil significantly reduced cardiac and renal damage in the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor model of hypertension (P < 0.05 versus untreated); however, high-dose candesartan caused a significant increase in renal damage in the Dahl salt-sensitive model of hypertension (P < 0.05 versus untreated). Interestingly, the beneficial end-organ effects of candesartan in the nitric oxide synthase inhibition model were independent of sustained antihypertensive actions of candesartan, whereas the exacerbation of renal injury with candesartan in the Dahl salt-sensitive model was inversely related to its blood pressure-lowering effect.
These data show that angiotensin type 1 blockade reduces injury in the l-nitroarginine methyl ester model but increases tissue injury in the salt-sensitive model. These data suggest that angiotensin II via angiotensin type 1 receptor activation contributes to organ damage in nitric oxide-deficient salt-independent hypertension but is protective in salt-induced hypertension. These data further suggest that (1) renal injury may evolve independently of blood pressure and (2) the effectiveness of an antihypertensive agent in ameliorating renal injury may depend on the etiology of the hypertension.
Digoxin, in a common clinical dose and at a low serum level, brought out severe manifestations of sinus node dysfunction in a patient who had previously undergone successful mitral valve replacement. This report presents the results of extensive clinical and electrophysiologic studies of this patient before and after a digoxin challenge. In the absence of cardiac glycoside, the only demonstrable abnormalities of sinus node function were mild resting sinus bradycardia and failure to respond to atropine administration. Responses to isoproterenol administration, programmed premature atrial stimulation, and overdrive pacing at several cycle lengths were normal. Following the administration of intravenous digoxin, 1.025 mg/24 hrs, the resting sinus cycle length increased and the response to overdrive pacing became markedly abnormal. The latter was followed by sinus pauses in excess of six seconds, even at relatively slow overdrive pacing rates. The electrophysiologic and clinical implications of these data are discussed. It is suggested that despite previous reports that digitalis preparations are relatively well tolerated by patients with sick sinus syndrome, caution should be used when administering these drugs to this group of patients.
The present study was undertaken to identify protective drugs against aminophylline (240 mg/kg i.p.)-induced convulsions and lethality in mice. Diazepam (10 mg/kg) and valproic acid significantly prevented the convulsions, but were not effective in preventing mortality. Phenytoin, atropine, carbamazepine and atenolol were ineffective in protecting against convulsions and death. Ketamine gave partial protection against convulsions, but was not effective in preventing mortality. Diazepam (10 mg/kg) and atenolol (5 mg/kg) administered together gave total protection against convulsions and death. These results show that aminophylline-induced convulsions are relatively resistant to antiepileptic drugs, and that a combination of diazepam and a beta-blocker (atenolol) has potential as an anti-aminophylline agent.
The mechanism of action of aminophylline in prolonging seizures was tested in amygdala-kindled rats. Aminophylline prolonged the afterdischarge duration of kindled seizures. This seizure-prolonging action of aminophylline was strongly antagonized by the adenosine A1 agonist cyclohexyladenosine and partially antagonized by the benzodiazepine partial agonist RO 15-1788. However, the specific benzodiazepine antagonist CGS 8216 did not affect the seizure-prolonging action of aminophylline. Also, the potent anticonvulsant effect of diazepam on kindled seizures, which was completely antagonized by CGS 8216, was unaffected by aminophylline. Furthermore, a range of benzodiazepine inverse agonists, GABA antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and xanthines did not prolong afterdischarge durations. These results demonstrate that the seizure-prolonging action of aminophylline is due to block of A1 adenosine receptors since it is prevented by adenosine A1 agonists.
Inorganic arsenic is a well-documented human carcinogen associated with cancers of the skin, lung, liver, and bladder. However, the underlying mechanisms explaining the tumorigenic role of arsenic are not well understood. The present study explored a potential mechanism of cell transformation induced by arsenic exposure. Exposure to a low dose (0.5 Î¼m) of arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) caused transformation of BALB/c 3T3 cells. In addition, in a xenograft mouse model, tumor growth of the arsenic-induced transformed cells was dramatically increased. In arsenic-induced transformed cells, polycomb group (PcG) proteins, including BMI1 and SUZ12, were activated resulting in enhanced histone H3K27 tri-methylation levels. On the other hand, tumor suppressor p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) mRNA and protein expression were dramatically suppressed. Introduction of small hairpin (sh) RNA-BMI1 or -SUZ12 into BALB/c 3T3 cells resulted in suppression of arsenic-induced transformation. Histone H3K27 tri-methylation returned to normal in BMI1- or SUZ12-knockdown BALB/c 3T3 cells compared with BMI1- or SUZ12-wildtype cells after arsenic exposure. As a consequence, the expression of p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) was recovered in arsenic-treated BMI1- or SUZ12-knockdown cells. Thus, arsenic-induced cell transformation was blocked by inhibition of PcG function. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the polycomb proteins, BMI1 and SUZ12 are required for cell transformation induced by organic arsenic exposure.
The effect of prostaglandins (PGs) F1 alpha, F2 alpha, E1, E2, D2, I2, A1, B1 injected into the lateral ventricle of the brain on morphine-induced catalepsy was studied in mice. The PGs were administered in doses of 1 microgram, the dose of morphine was 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally. It was found that PGs E1, E2 and D2 weakened, and F1 alpha, F2 alpha and I2 increased morphine-induced catalepsy. The results of this experiment showed a modifying effect of exogenous PGs on morphine-induced catalepsy, the effect differed depending on the prostaglandin used.
Acetaminophen toxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe. Although much is known about the metabolism of acetaminophen, many questions remain regarding the pathogenesis of liver injury. In this study, we examined the role of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), a protein important in mediating cellular response to lipopolysaccharides, by using LBP wild-type and knockout (KO) mice. We found that LBP KO mice were protected from acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. At 350 mg/kg of acetaminophen, LBP KO mice had significantly less liver injury and necrosis than wild-type mice. Repletion studies in LBP KO mice using an LBP-adenoviral construct resulted in significantly more hepatic injury and necrosis after acetaminophen exposure compared with mice receiving the control adenoviral construct. In conclusion, LBP KO mice are protected from toxicity with a decrease in hepatic necrosis following acetaminophen challenge. This suggests a novel role for LBP in modulating acetaminophen-induced liver injury.

Postoperative ileus (POI), an interruption of coordinated bowel motility after operation, is exacerbated by opioids used to manage pain. Alvimopan, a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist, accelerated gastrointestinal (GI) recovery after bowel resection in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III POI trials. The effect of alvimopan on POI-related morbidity for patients who underwent bowel resection was evaluated in a post-hoc analysis.
Incidence of POI-related postoperative morbidity (postoperative nasogastric tube insertion or POI-related prolonged hospital stay or readmission) was analyzed in four North American trials for placebo or alvimopan 12 mg administered 30 minutes or more preoperatively and twice daily postoperatively until hospital discharge (7 or fewer postoperative days). GI-related adverse events and opioid consumption were summarized for each treatment. Estimations of odds ratios of alvimopan to placebo and number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one patient from experiencing an event of POI-related morbidity were derived from the analysis.
Patients receiving alvimopan 12 mg were less likely to experience POI-related morbidity than patients receiving placebo (odds ratio = 0.44, p < 0.001). Fewer patients receiving alvimopan (alvimopan, 7.6%; placebo, 15.8%; NNT = 12) experienced POI-related morbidity. There was a lower incidence of postoperative nasogastric tube insertion, and other GI-related adverse events on postoperative days 3 to 6 in the alvimopan group than the placebo group. Opioid consumption was comparable between groups.
Alvimopan 12 mg was associated with reduced POI-related morbidity compared with placebo, without compromising opioid-based analgesia in patients undergoing bowel resection. Relatively low NNTs are clinically meaningful and reinforce the potential benefits of alvimopan for the patient and health care system.
Twelve patients who formed renal stones during acetazolamide treatment for glaucoma were studied. Calcium phosphate was the dominating component in the stones. Long term treatment with acetazolamide decreased urinary citrate markedly, which will result in an increased ion-activity product of calcium phosphate and a decreased inhibiting property of urine on calcium phosphate crystallization. The treatment also increased urinary oxalate which together with a low citrate might increase the risk of calcium oxalate crystallization. However, an estimate of the ion-activity product of calcium oxalate in urine (AP [CaOx]-index) was unaffected by the treatment and calcium oxalate was a minor component of the stones.
We conducted a subgroup analysis in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study to determine whether aspirin interacted with the properties of losartan, an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist.
Negative interactions between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aspirin have been reported. There are no data reported from clinical trials about possible interactions between angiotensin-II receptor antagonists and aspirin.
The LIFE study assigned 9,193 patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to losartan- or atenolol-based therapy for a mean of 4.7 years, with 1,970 (21.4%) taking aspirin at baseline. The primary composite end point (CEP) included cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). The present cohort was stratified by aspirin use at baseline.
Blood pressures were reduced similarly in the losartan with aspirin (n = 1,004) and atenolol with aspirin (n = 966) groups. The CEP was reduced by 32% (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.86, p = 0.001) with losartan with aspirin compared to atenolol with aspirin, adjusted for Framingham risk score and LVH. The test for treatment versus aspirin interaction, excluding other covariates, was significant for the CEP (p = 0.016) and MI (p = 0.037).
There was a statistical interaction between treatment and aspirin in the LIFE study, with significantly greater reductions for the CEP and MI with losartan in patients using aspirin than in patients not using aspirin at baseline. Further studies are needed to clarify whether this represents a pharmacologic interaction or a selection by aspirin use of patients more likely to respond to losartan treatment.
The dosage-regimen-dependent teratogenicity as well as plasma and tissue levels of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) were studied in the mouse by comparing various injection regimens and infusion of the drug via implanted osmotic minipumps. Concentrations of 225-248 micrograms VPA/ml maternal plasma (about 2X above the therapeutic concentration range) and 70-75 micrograms VPA/g gestational material (on gestation Day 8) resulted in a significant incidence of neural tube defects (exencephaly in the mouse). Similar effects were produced if those concentrations were reached several times after multiple injections or by steady-state application via implanted pumps. A single injection was less effective than multiple injections, although drug accumulation did not occur. The doses (or area under the concentration-time curve values) did not correlate with the teratogenic response of the different administration regimens: much higher (factor 10) doses were needed with the infusion regimen to produce exencephaly rates comparable to those obtained with the injection regimen. The pattern of embryotoxicity was also schedule dependent: steady-state concentrations produced predominantly embryolethality and fetal weight retardation, while intermittent injections produced a high incidence of exencephaly (up to 60% of live fetuses). The dose of VPA (and the areas under the concentration-time curves) correlated with the embryolethality and fetal weight retardation of the drug, while the peak or steady-state concentrations reached in mother and gestational material correlated with the incidence of neural tube defects.
Pain during topical aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) limits the use of this treatment of skin diseases.
We sought to summarize the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ALA-PDT-related pain, and to explore factors contributing to pain induction.
A PubMed search was performed to identify all clinical PDT trials (2000-2008) that used ALA or methyl-ALA, enrolled at least 10 patients per trial, and used a semiquantitative pain scale.
In all, 43 articles were identified for review. Pain intensity is associated with lesion size and location and can be severe for certain diagnoses, such as plaque-type psoriasis. Results are inconsistent for the correlation of pain with light source, wavelength of light, fluence rate, and total light dose. Cooling represents the best topical intervention.
Pain perception differs widely between patients and can contribute to variability in the reported results.
Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, cold/menthol receptors (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 8), and vanilloid/capsaicin receptors (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1) may be involved in pain perception during ALA-PDT and are therefore worthy of further investigation.
The effect of diazepam, haloperidol, MK-801, and propranolol in antagonizing behavioral symptoms induced by lethal doses of cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine were studied in a rat model. Animals were first pretreated IP with potential antagonists, diazepam (2, 5, and 10 mg/kg), haloperidol (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), propranolol (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), MK-801 (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 mg/kg), and then were challenged IP with cocaine (70 mg/kg) (LD85), d-amphetamine (75 mg/kg) (LD100), and methamphetamine (100 mg/kg) (LD90). Diazepam, at all doses, provided significant protection against cocaine- (p less than or equal to 0.01) and methamphetamine- (p less than or equal to 0.05) induced seizures and produced a dose-dependent effect against amphetamine-induced seizures. MK-801, at all doses, reduced seizures in all groups (p less than or equal to 0.01). Propranolol altered the incidence of methamphetamine-induced seizures. Significant protection against cocaine-induced death was afforded by diazepam (p less than or equal to 0.01) and propranolol (p less than or equal to 0.05). Significant protection against amphetamine-induced death was provided by haloperidol (all doses, p less than or equal to 0.1), MK-801 (all doses, p less than or equal to 0.1), and propranolol (10 and 20 mg/kg, p less than or equal to 0.1). No agent reduced the incidence of methamphetamine- (50 or 100 mg/kg) induced death. The failure of d-amphetamine antagonists to protect against methamphetamine-induced toxicity and death suggest that different mechanisms of toxicity may exist between these drugs.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes, possesses mitogenic and morphogenic activities for renal epithelial cells. To examine the renotropic function of HGF, we investigated the expression of HGF mRNA and HGF activity in the rat kidney after acute renal failure. When acute renal failure was induced by ischemia or by HgCl2 administration, a DNA synthesis occurred predominantly in the renal tubular cells located in the outer medulla with a peak at 48 h after the treatments. In both renal injuries, HGF mRNA in the kidney increased markedly, reaching a maximum 6 to 12 h after the treatments. HGF activity in the kidney also increased to three- to fourfold higher level than the normal level at 12 h after ischemic treatment or HgCl2 administration. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis indicated that both HGF mRNA and HGF protein were expressed in renal interstitial cells, presumably endothelial cells and macrophages, but not in tubular epithelial cells. In addition, HGF activity in the plasma of rats with renal ischemia or HgCl2 administration rapidly increased, reaching a maximum at 6 h after the treatment. One week after these injuries, HGF mRNA and HGF activity reverted to normal levels, and renal tubular cell regeneration ceased. Moreover, intravenous injection of human recombinant HGF into mice with acute renal failure caused by HgCl2 administration stimulated DNA synthesis of renal tubular cells in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Prostacyclin (PGI2) release by human aortic tissue obtained at surgery was assessed in patients (n = 23) with ischaemic heart disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (group 1) patients (n = 14) undergoing surgery for aortic stenosis (group 2), patients (n = 4) undergoing surgery for aortic regurgitation (group 3), and patients (n = 8) with ischaemic heart disease taking aspirin (group 4). Although there was a highly significant correlation between (a) intimal and medial PGI2 production and (b) medial PGI2 production and aortic diameter, there was no correlation between intimal PGI2 production and aortic diameter. Aspirin intake (75-150 mg daily) was associated with a pronounced inhibition (95%) of aortic PGI2 production. This inhibition of aortic PGI2 secretion by aspirin may account for the variable efficiency of aspirin in altering the natural history of vascular disease.
The effects of dose, administration frequency, and behavioral testing conditions on the development of tolerance versus sensitization to haloperidol-induced catalepsy were tested in rats. Animals received daily or weekly injections of haloperidol (0.05-5.00 mg/kg SC) for up to 22 days. Catalepsy assessments were made either once or repeatedly using two tests: the horizontal bar and the inclined screen. Tolerance was found only in animals treated daily with haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg) and tested repeatedly on the horizontal bar. In contrast, sensitization was observed with various haloperidol doses, daily or weekly administration schedules (for most doses), either horizontal bar or inclined screen catalepsy tests, and repeated or single testing. Sensitization developed most strongly following weekly drug administration and repeated testing on the horizontal bar. No single experimental variable produced a definitive pattern of change in catalepsy over time. Dose, drug administration schedule, and behavioral test conditions all influenced the evolution of catalepsy during chronic haloperidol treatment.
Valproic acid (VPA) is commonly prescribed and is generally considered to have a good safety profile. Severe neurological side effects, such as acute encephalopathy or tremor, are well-known. Parkinsonian syndromes and cognitive impairment have been very rarely reported with this drug.
Ten cases of reversible parkinsonism associated with VPA in 6 women and 4 men, associated with marked cognitive impairment in six cases, are described. These side effects sometimes occurred after several years of good tolerability.
All patients had serum levels within the therapeutic range (50-100 microg/ml). Symptoms improved several weeks or months after discontinuation of VPA therapy in every case.
Several cases of parkinsonian syndromes have been reported in the literature, but usually in children or young adults. These symptoms had an insidious and progressive onset. Clinical features can mimic Parkinson's disease and may be confusing, especially when they occur in older patients. The mechanism of these disorders is currently unknown, but several hypotheses have been proposed. Despite the good safety of VPA therapy for several years, a drug-induced mechanism of parkinsonism or cognitive impairment must be considered in all patients treated with VPA, as discontinuation of the drug can induce significant improvement of the patient's neurological and mental status.
Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder rarely occurs in young female patients. We present a case of bladder carcinoma which appeared after treatment with cyclophosphamide, in a 14-year-old girl genetically predisposed to bladder cancer.
To perform a meta-analysis using data from all clinical trials and studies of a ribosomal vaccine (Ribomunyl((R))) in order to estimate its overall effect on the number of infections and antibacterial courses used per person.
Meta-analysis of studies performed between 1985 and 1999 in 7 European countries and also in Kazakhstan, Tunisia, Morocco and Argentina.
Information from 14 213 adults and children.
There were 9 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, 3 randomised nonblind studies and 16 nonblind studies with no placebo arm in which the response to ribosomal vaccine was compared with historical information. The mean number of infections per person in a study period of 3 months using placebo was found to be 2.39 (standard error +/- 0.50), and in a study period of 6 months was 3.35 (+/-0.41) infections. In both study periods, ribosomal vaccine use was associated with a reduction in the number of infections per person of 1.43 (+/-0.26). In the study period, patients on placebo reported 3.02 (+/-0.44) antibacterial courses, whereas ribosomal vaccine was associated with a reduction of 1.32 (+/-0.42) antibacterial courses.
In spite of variability in data quality, and the small sample size in some of the studies, we conclude that in patients with recurrent respiratory infections ribosomal vaccine significantly reduces both the number of infections and the number of antibacterial courses compared with placebo. This study is a strong and objective demonstration of the efficacy of ribosomal vaccine in limiting the number of otorhinolaryngological infections in children and adults.
Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable malignancy, but treatment outcome might be influenced by inherited gene polymorphisms determining anticancer agent metabolism. We prospectively collected peripheral blood lymphocytes from 313 patients with Hodgkin lymphomas to analyze GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTT1, UGT1A1, and CYP3A4 enzyme gene polymorphisms. All patients were treated with chemotherapy, associated with radiotherapy when they had localized disease. There was no difference for GSTP1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 as well as for UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 polymorphism distributions between Hodgkin lymphoma patients and healthy controls. Patients carrying 1 or 2 UGT1A1*28 allele had a significantly (P < .05) better freedom from progression and time to treatment failure than those homozygous for the UGT1A1 TA6/TA6 allele. Multivariate prognostic analyses showed that the UGT1A1 polymorphism was as an independent prognostic parameter for all the studied endpoints, the wild-type homozygous UGT1A1 TA6/TA6 genotype being associated with a significantly worse prognosis than genotypes with at least one UGT1A1*28 allele (overall survival; relative risk [RR] = 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-6.14; P = .04; freedom from progression, RR = 2.70, 95% CI, 1.37-5.31; P = .004; time to treatment failure, RR = 2.37, 95% CI, 1.28-4.40, P = .006). UGT1A1 polymorphism on TA repeats, which are thought to determine several anticancer drugs metabolism, influence Hodgkin lymphoma patient outcome.
Aluminium has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases but exact mechanism of action is still not known. Mitochondria being a major site of reactive oxygen species production are considered to be target of oxidative stress and it seems that the oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins may underlie the pathogenesis of aluminium induced neurodegeneration. Thus, the present study was undertaken to reveal the effects of chronic aluminium exposure (10mg/kg b.wt, intragastrically for 12 weeks) on the oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins in male albino Wistar rats. Chronic aluminium exposure resulted in decrease in the activity of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and aconitase in different regions of rat brain suggesting increased oxidative stress. This decrease in MnSOD activity in turn might be responsible for the increased protein oxidation as observed in our study. All these processes taken together may cause increased oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins in general. By taking the advantage of recent immunochemical probe for oxidatively modified proteins, we identified MnSOD to be susceptible to oxidative damage in aluminium treated animals. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis for Lon protease, a protease involved in the removal of oxidatively modified proteins from mitochondria, showed decreased mRNA expression suggesting increased oxidative damage and decreased removal of mitochondrial proteins. The identification of specific proteins as targets of oxidative damage may provide new therapeutic measures to reverse the effects of aluminium induced neurodegeneration.
Left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume analysis was employed to assess the inotropic effect of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor enoximone (formerly MDL-17,043) in nine patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class IV symptoms, mean ejection fraction = 0.22). Left ventricular pressure-volume loops were constructed using high fidelity left ventricular pressure measured with micromanometer-tipped catheters and simultaneous left ventricular volume obtained by gated blood pool imaging. Afterload was reduced with the vasodilator nitroprusside to generate the baseline left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation, a relatively load-independent measure of contractile function. The intravenous administration of enoximone (mean dose 75 mg) shifted the end-systolic pressure-volume point upward and leftward from the baseline pressure-volume relation in eight of the nine patients, demonstrating a positive inotropic effect of this agent. The maximal rate of left ventricular pressure development (peak positive dP/dt) increased from 1,030 +/- 142 to 1,381 +/- 219 mm Hg/s (p less than 0.01) on enoximone despite a significant decrease in preload (as assessed by left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume) and a small, insignificant decrease in mean arterial pressure. Two patients developed angina after enoximone administration; both patients had coronary artery disease and experienced a greater than 30% increase in heart rate-systolic blood pressure product. Thus, enoximone has a significant inotropic effect in patients with severe heart failure. Like other inotropic drugs, it has the potential to increase myocardial oxygen demand and thereby precipitate ischemia.
The potent antiresorptive drug zoledronic acid (Zol) enhances the antitumor effects of chemotherapy agents in vitro. We investigated the effects of clinically achievable doses of doxorubicin (Dox) and Zol, given alone, in sequence, and in combination, on the growth of established breast tumors in vivo.
Female MF1 nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 5 x 10(5) human breast cancer MDA-MB-436 cells that stably expressed green fluorescent protein (ie, MDA-G8 cells). Beginning on day 7 after tumor cell injection, the mice were injected weekly for 6 weeks with saline, Dox (2 mg/kg body weight via intravenous injection), Zol (100 microg/kg body weight via intraperitoneal injection), Dox plus Zol, Zol followed 24 hours later by Dox, or Dox followed 24 hours later by Zol (n = 8-9 mice per group). The effects of treatment on tumor growth were determined by measuring tumor volume; on tumor cell apoptosis and proliferation by immunohistochemistry using antibodies for caspase-3 and Ki-67, respectively; and on bone by microcomputed tomography and bone histomorphometry. All P values are two-sided.
Treatment with Dox or Zol alone or Zol followed 24 hours later by Dox did not statistically significantly decrease final tumor volume compared with saline. Mice treated with Dox plus Zol had statistically significantly smaller final tumor volumes than those treated with Dox alone (mean = 122 mm(3) vs 328 mm(3), difference = 206 mm(3), 95% confidence interval [CI] = 78 to 335 mm(3), P < .001), with Zol alone (122 mm(3) vs 447 mm(3), difference = 325 mm(3), 95% CI = 197 to 454 mm(3), P < .001), or with Zol followed 24 hours later by Dox (122 mm(3) vs 418 mm(3), difference = 296 mm(3), 95% CI = 168 to 426 mm(3), P < .001). Treatment with Dox followed 24 hours later by Zol almost completely abolished tumor growth. Tumors from mice that were treated with Dox followed by Zol had more caspase-3-positive cells than tumors from mice treated with saline (mean number of caspase-3-positive cells per square millimeter: 605.0 vs 82.19, difference = 522.8, 95% CI = 488.2 to 557.4, P < .001), with Zol alone (605.0 vs 98.44, difference = 506.6, 95% CI = 472.0 to 541.2, P < .001), or with Zol followed by Dox (605.0 vs 103.1, difference = 501.9, 95% CI = 467.3 to 536.5, P < .001). The treatment-induced increase in the number of caspase-3-positive cells was mirrored by a decrease in the number of tumor cells positive for the proliferation marker Ki-67. No evidence of bone disease was detected in any of the treatment groups following microcomputed tomography and histological analysis of bone.
Sequential treatment with Dox followed by Zol elicited substantial antitumor effects in subcutaneous breast tumors in vivo, in the absence of bone disease.
The effects of single oral doses of bucindolol (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg), pindolol (10 mg), propranolol (160 mg) and placebo on arterial pressure and heart rate in the supine and standing positions and exercise heart rate were compared in 12 healthy male volunteers. Supine heart rate was significantly greater after all four doses of bucindolol and pindolol in comparison to propranolol. Bucindolol had no significant effect on standing heart rate which was significantly reduced by pindolol and propranolol. Bucindolol, pindolol and propranolol significantly reduced an exercise tachycardia for at least 24 h after drug administration. Supine systolic pressure was not affected by any treatment but supine diastolic pressure was significantly reduced by bucindolol (200 and 400 mg) and by pindolol. All doses of bucindolol, propranolol and pindolol significantly reduced standing systolic blood pressure. There was a significant linear trend for reductions in standing systolic blood pressure and increasing doses of bucindolol. Standing diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by bucindolol 200 and 400 mg. Faintness and light headedness occurred in 6 of 12 subjects after 200 mg bucindolol and in 8 of 10 subjects after 400 bucindolol. After bucindolol, analysis of plasma samples demonstrated the presence of bucindolol, 5-hydroxy and 6-hydroxy bucindolol and indolyl-t-butylamine. These observations indicate that in man, bucindolol is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with hypotensive activity and probably partial agonist activity. It is unlikely that the hypotensive effects result from blockade of beta-adrenoceptors or from the drug's partial agonist activity.
