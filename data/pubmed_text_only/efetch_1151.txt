Torsade de pointes is a form of polymorphous ventricular tachycardia in which the polarity of the QRS complex exhibits phasic alterations in both axis. Traditionally, torsade de pointes has been described in association with a congenital or acquired (including drug and metabolic) causes of QT prolongation. Clinical outcomes range from asymptomatic, self-terminating arrhythmias to ventricular fibrillation resulting in cardiac arrest. For the treatment of torsade de pointes, the conventional antiarrhythmic drugs cannot be relied on, cardiac pacing should be instituted as soon as possible; however, as this technique may not always be immediately available, isoproterenol infusion may be the first-choice treatment. Potassium and magnesium repletion appear to be essential in abolishing drug-induced torsade de pointes. This report describes a case of thioridazine-induced torsade de pointes treated efficaciously with magnesium sulphate and overdrive right ventricular pacing.
Sudanese mucosal leishmaniasis is a chronic infection of the upper respiratory tract and/or oral mucosa caused mainly by Leishmania donovani. The disease occurs in areas of the country endemic for visceral leishmaniasis, particularly among Masalit and other closely related tribes in western Sudan. The condition may develop during or after an attack of visceral leishmaniasis, but in most cases it is a primary mucosal disease. Unlike South American mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, mucosal leishmaniasis in Sudan is not preceded or accompanied by a cutaneous lesion. Pathologically, the lesions show a mixture of macrophages, plasma cells and lymphocytes. An epithelioid granuloma may also be found. Parasites are scanty. Diagnosis is established by demonstration of parasites in smears or biopsies, by culture or animal inoculation, or with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction. Most patients give positive results in the direct agglutination test and leishmanin skin test. Patients respond well to treatment with pentavalent antimony compounds.
Colchicine myoneuropathy is a rare and often underdiagnosed disease. It often presents as painless subacute muscle weakness. We present a case of painful colchicine myoneuropathy in a 76-year-old man with chronic renal failure and gout. Published work about clinical presentations of colchicine myoneuropathy in gouty arthritis patients are reviewed. During the previous year, the patient had a drug regimen of colchicine 0.5 mg three times per day for a 3 day course each month. He developed bilateral lower leg weakness and severe myalgia. His serum creatinine level was 680.7 micromol/L and creatinine kinase was 959 IU/L on admission. Laboratory findings included decreasing amplitude of motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity and an electromyogram showed small amplitude, short duration polyphasic waves over the right biceps. A muscle biopsy disclosed vacuolar changes in the cytoplasm. These results all supported a diagnosis of colchicine myoneuropathy. After cessation of colchicine, the creatinine kinase level decreased approximately 50% in 6 days, myalgia subsided and his muscle weakness improved gradually over the next 2 weeks.
Docetaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin have proven activity in a broad range of solid tumours and interfere with different phases of the cell cycle. We performed a phase I study with the aim to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of docetaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin in patients with solid tumours and to define the safety, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the recommended dose and administration schedule of docetaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin for further phase II testing. Docetaxel was given by 1-h infusion on day 1, followed by ifosfamide 1000 mg/m(2)/day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. Mesna was added at the same doses to the same infusion bag and was continued for 12 h after the end of ifosfamide. Cisplatin was administered as a 24-h infusion concomitantly with ifosfamide, but in separate infusion bags, either on day 5 (schedule A) or on day 1 (schedule B). Escalation steps were planned only for docetaxel (60, 75, 85 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (50, 75, 100 mg/m(2)). No intrapatient dose escalation was permitted. Prophylactic ciprofloxacin was used after a protocol amendment was implemented. No prophylactic haematopoietic growth factors were used. Cycles of docetaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin were given at 3-week intervals. Toxicity was scored according to National Cancer Institute Canada-Common Toxicity Criteria 2. The MTD was defined as the dose at which a DLT was observed in fewer than two of six patients during the first treatment cycle. In total, 85 patients received 309 cycles. Only three escalation steps could be explored and DLTs were observed at each dose level. In total, 32 patients and 49 cycles showed DLTs. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 20 patients (24%). Only two DLTs were nonhaematological (one cerebral infarction and one encephalopathy grade 4). Neutropenia grade 4 lasted for greater than 7 days and/or thrombocytopenia grade 4 was dose limiting in 10 patients. Febrile neutropenia occurred in five of 41 patients (12%) who received prophylactic ciprofloxacin and in 15 of 44 patients (34%) who did not. MTD was reached at level 3 (docetaxel, 75 mg/m(2) and cisplatin, 75 mg/m(2)). With a lower dose of docetaxel (60 mg/m(2)) both schedules A and B were feasible, although, overall, schedule A seemed to be better tolerated. On the basis of this phase I study, the recommended docetaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin regimen is docetaxel (60 mg/m(2)) on day 1, ifosfamide (1000 mg/m(2)/day) on days 1-5 and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) given on day 5. It is associated with substantial haematological toxicity, but this is feasible provided prophylactic antibiotics are used.
The effect of the withdrawal of long-term beta-adrenoceptor blockade on pulse rate and finger tremor was studied in 27 patients who had been treated for 2 years following an uncomplicated myocardial infarction with either atenolol, propranolol or placebo. During treatment, pulse rate was significantly lower in patients treated with propranolol or atenolol compared with placebo. Compared with the response in the placebo group the mean increase in tremor on withdrawal of propranolol was statistically significant for postural and for work tremor in both hands. A significant increase in tremor on withdrawal of atenolol occurred only in the postural position and in a narrow frequency band (left hand, 7-11 Hz; right hand, 7-9 Hz). The differences in the effect on tremor of withdrawal of treatment with propranolol or atenolol in doses which produced similar reductions in heart rate, emphasise the beta 2 classification of peripheral receptors associated with normal muscle tremor but do not exclude the involvement of beta 1-adrenoceptors.
Endocrine changes induced by dopaminergic inhibition may play a part in the development of sexual dysfunction (reduced libido/potency) in schizophrenic patients on long-term neuroleptic treatment. Prolactin, testosterone, LH and FSH serum level determinations by radioimmunoassays were performed in 24 schizophrenic males on long-acting fluphenazine decanoate treatment. Of these patients, sexual dysfunction was present in 17 cases, in 10 patients sexual activity remained unchanged. As compared to the 15 healthy controls (7.33 +/- 0.91 ng/ml), a significant increase of prolactin concentrations was found, i.e. 28.2 +/- 5.15 in the impotent groups, and 16.7 +/- 2.12 in the non-impotent group. The difference between the latter two mean values was, however, not significant. In the patients with normal sexual activity the increase of LH concentration was highly significant. It might be assumed that normal sexual behaviour despite neuroleptic treatment and hyperprolactinaemia is related to the high concentration of LH, though the mechanism of increased LH secretion has not been cleared as yet. The testosterone and FSH concentrations showed no differences in various groups.
Compounds acting on the cannabinoid (CB) receptors are involved in the control of cell fate, and there is an emerging consensus that CBs have anticancer effects. However, the CB-mediated effects are contradictory since some studies suggest stimulatory effects on cancer cell proliferation, and CBs have been shown to stimulate both proliferation and differentiation of other mitotic cells such as stem and progenitor cells. In this study, the concentration-dependent effects of synthetic and endogenous CBs on the viability of mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells have been examined by using fluorescence assays of cell membrane integrity, cell proliferation, oxidative stress, and detection of apoptosis and necrosis. All compounds examined produced a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability in the micromolar range, with the potent CB receptor agonist HU 210 and the enantiomer HU 211 (with no CB receptor activity) being the most potent compounds examined with apparent IC50 values of 1 and 0.6 μM, respectively. The endogenous CB anandamide showed similar potency and efficacy as structurally related polyunsaturated fatty acids with no reported activity at the CB receptors. The rapid (within hours) decrease in cell viability induced by the examined CBs suggests cytocidal rather than antiproliferative effects and is dependent on the plating cell population density with the highest toxicity around 100 cells/mm(2). The CB-induced cytotoxicity, which appears to involve CB receptors and the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway, is a mixture of both apoptosis and necrosis that can be blocked by the antioxidants α-tocopherol and N-acetylcysteine. In conclusion, both synthetic and endogenous CBs produce seemingly unspecific cytotoxic effects in the P19 EC cells.
RhoA is a member of Rho GTPases, a subgroup of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. RhoA, as an important regulator of diverse cellular signaling pathways, plays significant roles in cytoskeletal organization, transcription, and cell-cycle progression. The RhoA/ROCK inhibitors have emerged as a new promising treatment for cardiovascular diseases. However, to date, RhoA inhibitors are macromolecules, and to our knowledge, small molecular-based inhibitors have not been reported. In this study, a series of first-in-class small molecular RhoA inhibitors have been discovered by using structure-based virtual screening in conjunction with chemical synthesis and bioassay. Virtual screening of ∼200,000 compounds, followed by SPR-based binding affinity assays resulted in three compounds with binding affinities to RhoA at the micromolar level (compounds 1-3). Compound 1 was selected for further structure modifications in considering binding activity and synthesis ease. Fourty-one new compounds (1, 12a-v, 13a-h, and 14a-j) were designed and synthesized accordingly. It was found that eight (12a, 12j, 14a, 14b, 14d, 14e, 14 g, and 14h) showed high RhoA inhibition activities with IC(50) values of 1.24 to 3.00 μM. A pharmacological assay indicated that two compounds (14g and 14 h) demonstrated noticeable vasorelaxation effects against PE-induced contraction in thoracic aorta artery rings and served as good leads for developing more potent cardiovascular agents.
Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a highly aggressive, periarticular soft tissue sarcoma that causes death in more than half of affected children, adolescents, and young adults. Five- and 10-year survival rates are as low as 36 and 20%, respectively. Bcl-2, a negative regulator of apoptosis, is overexpressed in up to 90% of SS. Increased Bcl-2 expression not only leads to the development of cancer, but also to resistance of many anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesized reducing Bcl-2 expression in SS should enhance doxorubicin cytotoxicity. Cell cultures representing two human sarcomas (FU-SY-1 SS and the pleomorphic SW982) and a primary human dermal fibroblast comparator (NHDF) were exposed in vitro to doxorubicin, or to doxorubicin preceded by Bcl-2 (G3139) antisense oligonucleotides, and assayed for cell survival, apoptosis, and modulations in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNA and protein content. SW982 sarcoma cells proved most susceptible to doxorubicin, while NHDF mesenchymal cells were least sensitive to doxorubicin. Treatment of FU-SY-1 SS with G3139 reduced Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels, which enhanced doxorubicin-induced cell killing. There was a concurrent reduction in Bcl-xL mRNA following G3139 application in FU-SY-1 and NHDF cultures, but not in SW982. G3139 anti-Bcl-2 intervention sensitized the FU-SY-1 SS to doxorubicin, due to increased apoptosis. G3139 intervention was ineffective in the two non-SS cell lines.
We describe a patient who developed dilated cardiomyopathy and clinical congestive heart failure after 2 months of therapy with amphotericin B (AmB) for disseminated coccidioidomycosis. His echocardiographic abnormalities and heart failure resolved after posaconazole was substituted for AmB. It is important to recognize the rare and potentially reversible toxicity of AmB.
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a very common disorder. Treatment intends to relieve symptoms, prevent complications and recurrence of the disease. The initial approach in a patient with heartburn alone is to begin a therapeutic trial with antacids sucralfate, a prokinetic agent, a histamine-receptor antagonist or a low dose of a proton pump inhibitor. If the therapeutic trial fails, dysphagia or atypical symptoms are present, therapy depends on diagnostic findings. In mild and moderate disease, acute treatment consists of 20 to 40 mg of a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole, lansoprazole or pantoprazole) and maintenance treatment of low dose omeprazole (10 mg). In severe disease a higher dose is administered, 40 to 80 mg of omeprazole, lansoprazole or pantoprazole for acute treatment and 20 mg of omeprazole for maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment is adjusted to symptoms and in the case of severe disease also to endoscopic findings.
Twenty-one children (19 with leukemia) were given 34 courses of vindesine on a weekly or twice-weekly schedule in escalating doses. Thirty-three courses were fully or partially evaluable for response and/or toxicity. Granulocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. Transient jaw, neck, or bone pain was common after each dose. Motor weakness, paresthesias, and constipation were neither frequent nor severe. In this Phase I study, vindesine had some antileukemia activity in children previously treated with vincristine and other drugs. Phase II studies are warranted and a starting does of 1.85% mg/m2 twice weekly appears tolerable.
Three patients with probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) experienced worsening delusions and visual hallucinations as a result of memantine therapy. Significant resolution occurred once treatment was discontinued. Caution is required when prescribing memantine to patients with possible DLB.
Intrinsic radioresistance, tumor hypoxia and ability of cancer cells to undergo rapid repopulation during radiotherapy are associated with failure of radiotherapy. Tumors with low alpha/beta-ratio values or hypoxic tumors unable to undergo re-oxygenation, are unlikely to be eradicated with standard radiotherapy. Although the therapeutic efficacy of accelerated regimens based on low-dose per fraction may be high since they minimize the adverse role of rapid tumor repopulation, the cellular compartment with low alpha/beta-ratio values (i.e. hypoxic cells) remains a limiting factor. Accelerated hypofractionation, which may be more effective in such tumors, cannot be safely applied unless normal tissues are protected. In the present study we assessed the feasibility of hypofractionated and accelerated radiotherapy supported by cytoprotection (HypoARC) with high dose daily amifostine. Fifteen breast cancer patients with locally advanced disease entered radiation-dose escalation protocoL Twelve consecutive fractions of 3.5-4Gy (5 fractions/week) were given to the breast/chest wall, supraclavicular and axillary area, within 17 days. A high dose of amifostine, at 1,000 mg flat dose, was given 20 minutes before each radiotherapy fraction. Amifostine administration was well- tolerated with minor side-effects (vomiting in 6 out of 15 and hypotention in 2 out of 15 patients). Radiation induced acute skin toxicity was negligible (grade 3 in 1 out of 15 patients). Ten out of 15 patients survived more than 12 months and 7 out of 15 more than 18 months following HypoARC. None of these patients showed any signs of late sequellae, such as lung and myoskeletal fibrosis, or brachial plexopathy. Complete and partial responses were obtained in 11 out of 15 (73%) and in 4 out of 15 (27%) patients, respectively. High dose daily amifostine during hypofractionated radiotherapy is feasible. HypoARC regimen is well-tolerated, effective and has minimal acute and late toxicity to normal breast, chest and axillary tissues.
Two patients with signs of carbamazepine neurotoxicity after combined treatment with verapamil showed complete recovery after discontinuation of the calcium entry blocker. Use of verapamil in combination with carbamazepine should either be avoided or prescribed only with appropriate adjustment of the carbamazepine dose (usually reduction of the carbamazepine dose by one half).
This study assessed the safety and efficacy of carvedilol in patients with heart failure caused by idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Carvedilol is a mildly beta 1-selective beta-adrenergic blocking agent with vasodilator properties. Beta-blockade may be beneficial in patients with heart failure, but the effects of carvedilol are not known.
Sixty patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV) and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.35 were enrolled in the study. All patients tolerated challenge with carvedilol, 3.125 mg twice a day, and were randomized to receive carvedilol (n = 36) versus placebo (n = 24). Study medication was titrated over 1 month from 6.25 to 25 mg twice a day (< 75 kg) or 50 mg twice a day (> 75 kg) and continued for 3 months. One placebo-treated and two carvedilol-treated patients did not complete the study.
Carvedilol therapy resulted in a significant reduction in heart rate and mean pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures and a significant increase in stroke volume and left ventricular stroke work. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased 52% in the carvedilol group (from 0.21 to 0.32, p < 0.0001 vs. placebo group). Carvedilol-treated patients also reported a significant lessening of heart failure symptoms (p < 0.05 vs. placebo group). Submaximal exercise duration tended to increase with carvedilol therapy (from 688 +/- 31 s to 871 +/- 32 s), but this change was not significantly different from that with placebo therapy by between-group analysis. Peak oxygen consumption during maximal exercise did not change.
Long-term carvedilol therapy improves rest cardiac function and lessens symptoms in patients with heart failure.
The present study intended to investigate whether the impaired H2S synthase/H2S pathway is associated with hypertension.
Hypertension in Wistar rats was induced by the oral administration of the l-arginine analog, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) in their drinking water for a period of 6 weeks. The control rats were given plain tap water only. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) was given by intraperitoneal injection to both the control group and the l-NAME-treated group. The systolic BP (blood pressure) was measured by a tail-cuff method using a pulse transducer. Plasma hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and H2S generation by thoracic aorta and superior mesenteric artery, were determined. In addition, the activity of cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) in thoracic aorta and superior mesenteric artery, most responsible for H2S production, was also measured. Competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine CSE mRNA in thoracic aorta.
l-NAME caused a time-dependent elevation of systolic BP. The heart-to-body weight ratio of l-NAME-treated rats was 27% higher than that of controls. The systolic BP in the NaHS-treated l-NAME group was significantly decreased, by 19% (P < 0.01), in comparison with the l-NAME group. The heart-to-body weight ratio decreased significantly by 12%. l-NAME inhibited CSE gene expression significantly. The inhibition of H2S generation and CSE activity by l-NAME was greatly attenuated in the NaHS-treated l-NAME group. However, there was no significant difference in nitric oxide (NO) generation between the l-NAME group and the NaHS-treated l-NAME group.
In summary, dysfunction of the vascular H2S synthase/H2S pathway was found in l-NAME-induced hypertensive rats. Exogenous H2S effectively prevented the development of hypertension induced by l-NAME. These findings suggest that the H2S synthase/H2S pathway participates in hypertension.
Rats subjected to inhalation of 3500 ppm o-xylene for 6 weeks were found to increase their body-weight at a lower rate than did the controls, despite an increased food and fluid intake, and to develop hepatic enlargement. Post mortem studies revealed no other abnormality. The distribution of the hepatocellular nuclei according to size was, however, modified. The proportion of large nuclei was higher in the test animals than in the controls, and the number of cells per unit area was lower, as a sign of cellular hypertrophy. Electron microscopic studies revealed a loss of glycogen, and increase of rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and of peroxisomes. These changes which are typical of the adaptational phase of poisoning may be connected with the induction of the mixed function oxidase system. Enzyme histochemical and ultrastructural studies also revealed a slight hepatocellular damage.
A 67-year-old man who had been heart transplanted ten years before was admitted to our hospital because of diarrhea. During his stay he developed a severe lingual and facial angioedema. After excluding hereditary angioedema caused by a deficiency in functional C1 esterase inhibitor we focused on adverse effects of his drugs. The medication was composed of Aspirin, Enalapril, Diltiazem, Everolimus, Mycophenolate Mofetil, Bisoprolol, Pravastatin, Esomeprazol and Allopurinol. The angioedema disappeared with anti-allergic treatment. The administration of the suspected trigger enalapril was stopped. However weeks later the patient was admitted again with angioedema. Due to missing urticaria Aspirin was unlikely the causer. The only new drug the patient had been medicated with was Everolimus for 30 days. We assumed a link between the angioedema and Everolimus. Consequently we changed the immunosuppressive regime. After stopping Everolimus no angioedema occurred.
Everolimus is a potential trigger of angioedema.
Although limited, epidemiologic studies suggest possible associations between butylate use and cancer risk, specifically prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). We examined butylate use and cancer risk more broadly in the AHS, a cohort of licensed pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. Pesticide use information was collected using self-administered questionnaires. Poisson regression was used to calculate rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Two exposure metrics were used: lifetime exposure days (LD) and intensity-weighted lifetime exposure days (IWLD). We used two referent groups: unexposed to butylate and the lowest butylate usage category. This analysis included 19,655 applicators with complete butylate use information; 5297 applicators were exposed to butylate, making this the largest study of butylate to date. The mean follow-up time since enrollment was 9 years. Prostate cancer risk was significantly elevated among applicators in the highest LD category in both referent groups (low-exposed referent: RR(LD)=2.09, 95% CI=1.27-3.44). We observed a significantly elevated joint effect of prostate cancer family history and high butylate usage across both exposure metrics and both referent groups (low-exposed referent: RR(LD)=2.00, 95% CI=1.07-3.74), and a non-significant, elevated interaction between butylate use and prostate cancer family history, similar to a previous AHS finding. Statistically significant increased risks and exposure-response trends were seen for all lymphohematopoietic cancers (AL) and NHL for both exposure metrics and referent groups (low-exposed referent: AL:RR(LD)=2.27, 95% CI=1.18-4.37; NHL: RR(LD)=3.44, 95% CI=1.29-9.21). Our analysis did not find meaningful associations for other cancers analyzed. Further study is warranted for AL, NHL and prostate cancers.
We examined the auditory function of 29 subjects affected by homozygous beta-thalassemia, managed with an high transfusion scheme and regularly treated with 40-60 mg/kg/day of desferrioxamine. A group of 29 healthy subjects is studied as control. We found conductive hearing defect in 8 thalassemics (6 bilateral) and sensory-neural hearing loss at high frequencies in 4. Thalassemic patients showed more auditory impairment than controls, an higher incidence of tonsillar hypertrophy, adenotonsillitis and submandibular lymph-node enlargement.
Glucocorticoids (triamcinolone) and dioxins (TCDD) are highly specific teratogens in the mouse, in that cleft palate is the major malformation observed. Glucocorticoids and TCDD both readily cross the yolk sac and placenta and appear in the developing secondary palate. Structure-activity relationships for glucocorticoid- and TCDD-induced cleft palate suggest a receptor involvement. Receptors for glucocorticoids and TCDD are present in the palate and their levels in various mouse strains are highly correlated with their sensitivity to cleft palate induction. Receptors for glucocorticoids appear to be more prevalent in the palatal mesenchymal cells whereas those for TCDD are probably located in the palatal epithelial cells. Glucocorticoids exert their teratogenic effect on the palate by inhibiting the growth of the palatal mesenchymal cells whereas TCDD alters the terminal cell differentiation of the medial palatal epithelial cells.
An investigation of the proportion of patients who have experienced mania with antidepressant treatment and their characteristics would seem to be of clinical use.
The purpose of this clinical study was to examine the predictors of induction of mania in depression patients as a result of paroxetine treatment.
A retrospective cohort analysis was carried out among depression patients treated in the Department of Psychiatry, Kawasaki Medical School Hospital, Kurashiki, Japan, in 2000 and 2001. Some 79 patients were identified who were receiving paroxetine to treat depression. A variety of clinical factors including gender, the type of depression, frequency of episodes, family history, age and daily dose were examined as possible predictors of induction of mania by paroxetine.
Seven (8.86%) of the 79 paroxetine-treated patients developed mania. A Cox proportional hazards analysis showed the type of depression and the history of family psychiatric illness to be independent predictive factors of the induction of mania by paroxetine treatment.
The rate of mania induction of paroxetine is not substantially different from that found for conventional antidepressants. The type of depression and the history of family psychiatric illness may be considered as predictors of mania induction in depression patients taking paroxetine treatment.
The objective of the current study was to explore the potential cognitive benefits of an anticholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, in a former chronic drug user. A neuropsychological test battery composed of the vocabulary and matrix reasoning subtests of the Wechsler adult intelligence scale-III, measures of everyday executive functioning (behavioural assessment of the dysexecutive syndrome [BADS]), and verbal learning and memory tasks (California verbal learning test-II; Rivermead behavioural memory test) was completed at baseline, at 3 months after introducing donepezil, and at 3 months after donepezil was discontinued. After donepezil treatment, substantial improvements were found on tasks of nonverbal fluid reasoning (i.e. matrix reasoning) and other executive functioning tests (i.e. BADS). At entry into the study, poor academic performance and subjective problems with memory and concentration were reported, particularly after amphetamine use (i.e. MDMA and crystal methamphetamine); after donepezil treatment, dramatic increases in memory, concentration and academic achievement were observed. The finding of improvements in tests of executive functioning and in academic performance in this case study, together with the minimal adverse side effects of donepezil, warrants the investigation of controlled studies of cholinergic enhancement in chronic amphetamine and other drug users.
Fluoxetine (Lilly 110140) is a potent, specific serotonin (5-HT) uptake blocker which is being tested in man for antidepressant activity. One of 9 depressed patients receiving this drug developed a dystonic reaction, parkinsonian rigidity, and increased serum prolactin levels, all signs of decreased dopaminergic activity. Homovanillic acid levels also decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid of this subject. We postulate that fluoxetine, via the increase in 5-HT activity resulting from 5-HT uptake blockade, inhibited both the nigro-striatal and tubero-infundibular dopaminergic neurons. These results provide additional evidence for a linkage between serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in man.
A 74-year-old man with cholestatic hepatitis after 3 months of taking ticlopidine is presented herein. Viral serology and autoantibodies were negative. There was no evidence of biliary tree obstruction. After ticlopidine was discontinued, liver tests were normal in 3 months. We review the other cases published in the literature.
