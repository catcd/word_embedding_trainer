Progestogens probably have metabolic effects that may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular reactions associated with combined oestrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives. This possibility was investigated by a study of nearly 2000 reports to the Committee on Safety of Medicines from 1964 to 1977. The reports concerned preparations in which norethisterone acetate in doses of 1.0, 2.5, 3.0, or 4.0 mg was combined with 50 microgram of ethinyloestradiol and those in which levonorgestrel in doses of 150 or 250 microgram was combined with 30 microgram of ethinyloestradiol. Observed and expected numbers of reports were compared, using retail pharmacy purchase figures as a measure of the use of different preparations. There was a significant positive association between the dose of norethisterone acetate and deaths from stroke and ischaemic heart disease (IHD); this association was also found for all cases of these two conditions, fatal plus non-fatal. There were no associations of dose of norethisterone acetate with hypertension or venous thrombosis. The higher dose of levonorgestrel was associated with a possible excess of deaths, non-venous plus venous, and an excess of strokes. There was no association between dose of levonorgestrel and hypertension or venous thrombosis. The reports were also used to assess the relative safety of 30-microgram and 50-microgram oestrogen preparations. Those with 30 microgram of oestrogen were associated with significantly fewer reports of death and IHD (both fatal, and fatal plus non-fatal) than those with 50 microgram of oestrogen. In view of the large-scale move towards preparations with progressively lower oestrogen doses, there are no grounds for major changes in oral contraceptive practice. Within the range of preparations currently in use, however, there is a case for minimising the dose of progestogen to reduce the chances of thromboembolism.
It has been shown previously that the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone induces apoptosis of granule cells in the dentate gyrus and striatopallidal neurons in the dorsomedial caudate-putamen. We investigated whether or not dexamethasone can induce damage to other neuronal populations. This issue was addressed using OX42 immunohistochemistry to visualise activated microglia and thereby gauge the extent of dexamethasone-induced neuronal death. A single dose of dexamethasone (20mg/kg, i.p.) administered to young male Sprague-Dawley rats induced a strong microglial reaction which was restricted to the striatum, the dentate gyrus and all of the CA subfields of the hippocampus. Some OX42-immunoreactive cells were also seen in the lateral septal nucleus. Subsequent quantitative analysis of silver/methenamine-stained sections confirmed that acute administration of dexamethasone induced apoptosis in the striatum and all regions of the hippocampus at doses as low as 0.7mg/kg. In contrast, dexamethasone failed to induce apoptosis in the lateral septal nucleus at doses up to 20mg/kg. The levels of dexamethasone-induced striatal and hippocampal apoptosis were attenuated by pretreatment with the corticosteroid receptor antagonist RU38486 (Mifepristone), which implies that the cell death was mediated by a corticosteroid receptor-dependent process. We further determined whether dexamethasone induced sublethal damage to neurons by quantifying reductions in the number of microtubule-associated protein-2-immunoreactive striatal and hippocampal cells following injection of the corticosteroid. Dexamethasone induced dramatic decreases in the striatum, with the dorsomedial caudate-putamen being particularly affected. Similar damage was seen in the hippocampus, with the dentate gyrus and CA1 and CA3 subfields being particularly vulnerable.Equivalent corticosteroid-induced neuronal damage may occur in mood disorders, where the levels of endogenous corticosteroids are often raised. Corticosteroid-induced damage of striatal and hippocampal neurons may also account for some of the cognitive deficits seen following administration of the drugs to healthy volunteers.
To study whether interferon (IFN) alpha and ribavirin combination therapy has a beneficial effect for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B, we enrolled 119 such patients in a randomized study. Fifty-nine patients received 5 million units of IFN-alpha2b daily for 4 weeks followed by 5 million units three times a week for 28 weeks, plus 1,200 mg ribavirin daily. Sixty patients received the same dosage of IFN plus placebo. They were followed up for 24 weeks posttreatment, and 105 patients (88%) completed the entire course of 56 weeks. By intention-to-treat analysis, the rate of combined response (serum hepatitis B virus [HBV] DNA <2.5 pg/mL and HBeAg seroconversion) was 17% versus 25% between the IFN/ribavirin and IFN/placebo group, respectively, at the end of treatment (P = .35) and 25% vs. 20% at the end of follow-up (P = .32). Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, the log10 reduction of serum HBV DNA was 1.05 +/- 1.72 (mean +/- SD) versus 1.29 +/- 1.91 between the two groups at the end of treatment (P = .49) and was 2.15 +/- 2.15 versus 1.21 +/- 2.48 at the end of follow-up (P = .04). Prolonged observations in 83 patients suggested that the combined response was 29% (n = 17) versus 20% (n = 12) at 48 weeks after the end of treatment, respectively (P = .17). The safety profile was similar, except that the IFN/ribavirin group had a higher risk of anemia (15% vs. 0%; P = .002). In conclusion, for the treatment of HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, adding ribavirin does not seem to increase the efficacy of IFN.
Two cases of organic psychosis, induced by the new chemotherapeutic agent ofloxacin (Tarivid), are described. According to DSM-III-R and ICD 10 (draft, 1987) both cases present as different, yet well-defined diagnostic categories: the new diagnostic systems appear to be superior and markedly more differentiated than ICD-9, since they provide a more exact and comprehensive description and more specific diagnostic allocation, especially in substance-specific syndromes. The possible involvement of GABAergic and monaminergic mechanisms in this psychotic symptomatology and their relationship to hypersynchronous states are discussed in detail.
In a 38-year-old male patient suffering from a severe postzosteric trigeminal neuralgia, intravenous application of 10 mg biperiden lactate led to a long-lasting paradoxical reaction characterized by considerable bradycardia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. The heart rate was back to normal within 12 hours upon administration of orciprenaline under cardiac monitoring in an intensive care unit. Bradycardia induced by biperiden is attributed to the speed of injection and to a dose-related dual effect of atropine-like drugs on muscarine receptors.
We previously reported that Arsenic trioxide (ATO) can inhibit glioma growth both in vitro and in vivo. While the use of ATO alone for solid tumor treatment sometimes was found to be ineffective which may be due to the protective pathways including heat shock proteins (HSPs) response induced by ATO. In this study, we modified HSPs expression to investigate whether HSPs had some effect on ATO induced glioma cell death.
Trypan bule exclusion assay, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) Assay, and SubG1 detection were used to evaluate cell viability and western-blot was employed to detect HSPs and some apoptosis markers expression induced by ATO. Heat pre-treatment, HSPs inhibitor, or Heat Shock factor-1 (HSF1) knockdown by SiRNA was employed to modify HSPs levels.
It was showed that KNK437 (HSPs inhibitor) or HSF1 knockdown significantly enhanced cell death, MMP disruption, JNK phosphorylation and caspase-3 cleavage induced by ATO, which was accompanied by abrogation of HSPs induction, while heat pre-treatment with clear HSPs induction had strong protection on the effects mentioned above.
Those data suggested that HSPs play protective roles on ATO induced cell death in glioma. Inhibition of HSPs may have a synergistic effect with ATO on glioma treatment.
Gastrointestinal (GI) hormones play an important role in GI secretion, motility, and eating behaviors. It was recently suggested that GI hormones may have a trophic role in GI tract. Here we demonstrate that two principal GI hormones, anorexigenic peptide YY (PYY) and orexigenic ghrelin, affect neural tube development. Chronic administration into the pregnant mice or transgenic overexpression of PYY led to a neural tube defect (NTD) in the embryos that was blocked by ghrelin. PYY Y1 receptor antagonist prevented the occurrence of NTD induced not only by PYY but also by vitamin A, a well-known teratogen in humans and animals. Y1 receptor deficiency also engendered NTDs, indicating the need to maintain normal Y1 receptor signaling. The present study is the first linking GI hormones to the leading cause of infant mortality and provides a novel insight for neurogenesis in which materno-fetal communication through GI hormones appears to be important.
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is an inherited systemic disorder of connective tissue characterized by fragmentation of elastic fibers and calcification in cutaneous, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. Mutation in the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6 gene has recently been found in people with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. However, the precise mechanisms of elastic fiber fragmentation and calcification remain obscure. Recently, it has been reported that mild chronic oxidative stress affects pseudoxanthoma elasticum fibroblasts. This suggests that reactive oxygen scavengers might improve this disorder.
A 68-year-old male was admitted for interstitial pneumonia associated with scleroderma. High-dose methylprednisolone was administered for treatment of the pneumonitis. Two weeks later, anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive increase in BUN, creatinine and LDH were observed. Although the blood pressure remained normotensive, renal biopsy showed thrombosis of the polar arterioles and glomerular capillaries. The affected interlobular artery included concentric intimal thickening and thrombosis in the lumen. Our findings suggested that the antecedent use of high-dose corticosteroids is involved in precipitating normotensive renal crisis. Corticosteroids should be used in low doses and with great caution in scleroderma patients.
We describe bilateral optic neuropathy in a patient affected by ovarian carcinoma treated with cis-platin 160 mg/m2 and carboplatin, 640 mg/m2. The patient was followed for 1 year, when recovery appeared. The few previous descriptions of CDDP optic nerve toxicity did not report recovery.
Computerized visual field, visual evoked potentials, pattern electroretinograms, full field flash electroretinograms were recorded during follow-up.
Optic neuritis appeared 13 weeks after cis-platin discontinuation, with right eye central scotoma; 2 days later the patient became bilaterally blind. Visual evoked potentials were initially absent, reappeared, with delayed latencies to left eye stimuli at 6 months, in both eyes at 9 months. At 1 year delayed VEPs were recorded with right eye stimuli, normal VEPs were recorded for left eye.
Cis-platin can induce delayed optic neuritis, that can recover in 1 year.
Arsenic is a well-recognized human carcinogen, yet the mechanism by which it causes human cancer has not been elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a big family of small noncoding RNAs and negatively regulate the expression of a large number of protein-coding genes. We investigated the role of miRNAs in arsenic-induced human bronchial epithelial cell malignant transformation and tumor formation. We found that prolonged exposure of immortalized p53-knocked down human bronchial epithelial cells (p53(low)HBECs) to low levels of arsenite (NaAsO₂, 2.5 μM) caused malignant transformation that was accompanied by epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduction in the levels of miR-200 family members. Stably reexpressing miR-200b in arsenite-transformed cells (As-p53(low)HBECs) completely reversed their transformed phenotypes, as evidenced by inhibition of colony formation in soft agar and prevention of xenograft tumor formation in nude mice. Moreover, stably expressing miR-200b alone in parental nontransformed p53(low)HBECs was sufficient to completely prevent arsenite exposure from inducing EMT and malignant transformation. Further mechanistic studies showed that depletion of miR-200 in arsenite-transformed cells involved induction of the EMT-inducing transcription factors zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox factor 1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2 and increased methylation of miR-200 promoters. Stably expressing ZEB1 alone in parental nontransformed p53(low)HBECs was sufficient to deplete miR-200, induce EMT and cause cell transformation, phenocopying the oncogenic effect of 16-week arsenite exposure. These findings establish for the first time a causal role for depletion of miR-200b expression in human cell malignant transformation and tumor formation resulting from arsenic exposure.
Although the myotoxins bupivacaine and notexin are employed for studying processes that regulate muscle regeneration after injury, no studies have compared their efficacy in causing muscle damage or assessing functional regeneration in mouse skeletal muscles. Bupivacaine causes extensive injury in rat muscles but its effects on mouse muscles are variable. We compared functional and morphological properties of regenerating mouse extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles after notexin or bupivacaine injection and tested the hypothesis that muscle damage would be more extensive and functional repair less complete after notexin injection. Bupivacaine caused degeneration of 45% of fibers and reduced maximum force (Po) to 42% of control after 3 days. In contrast, notexin caused complete fiber breakdown and loss of functional capacity after 3 days (P < 0.05). At 7 and 10 days after bupivacaine, Po was restored to 65% and 71% of control, respectively, whereas Po of notexin-injected muscles was only 10% and 39% of control at these time-points, respectively (P < 0.05). At 7 and 10 days after bupivacaine, approximately 30% of fibers were centrally nucleated (regenerating), whereas notexin-injected muscles were comprised entirely of regenerating fibers (P < 0.05). The results demonstrate that notexin causes a more extensive and complete injury than bupivacaine, and is a useful model for studying muscle regeneration in mice.
A new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is based on providing trophic support for degenerating dopaminergic (DA) neurons. It can be accomplished by administration of neurotrophic factors, or inducing astrocytes to differentiate and produce such factors. Antineoplaston A5 (A5), which is a naturally-occurring cytodifferentiating agent, may induce astrocytes to undergo normal differetiation, produce neurotrophic factors and alleviate the symptoms of PD. This paper describes studies on the influence of A5 on subtypes of central DA receptors by measuring the potency of haloperidol catalepsy in rats. A5, D1 agonist, and D1 D2 antagonists were given i.p. and D2 agonist s.c. for three consecutive days. Haloperidol catalepsy was measured by the method of Costall and Nylor. The degree of catalepsy was assessed every 30 min for 24 h and statistically evaluated using the Student's t-test. The results confirmed that A5 significantly attenuated catalepsy and stimulates dopamine D2 receptors. It reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol and D2 antagonists, but increases cataleptogenic activity if given in combination with the D2 agonist. This leads to the conclusion that A5 as a naturally-occurring agent neutralizes both hyper- and hypoactivity of central dopaminergic structures. Besides possible use as an antiparkinsonism agent, A5 may find application in the treatment of other disturbances of dopaminergic transmission.
Animal studies have shown that toluene can cause hearing loss and can exacerbate the effects of noise by inhibiting the middle ear acoustic reflex. In this investigation, carried out in Long-Evans rats, the tensor tympani tendon was cutoff and the stapedius muscle was electrocoagulated in one or both middle ears. Rat hearing was evaluated by measuring cubic distortion otoacoustic emissions (2f1-f2; f1 = 8000 Hz; f2 = 9600 Hz; f1/f2 = 1.2) prior to, during, and after activation of the olivocochlear (OC) reflex. A band noise centered at 4 kHz was used as suppressor noise. It was delivered contralaterally to decrease 2f1-f2 amplitude. The strength of the inner ear acoustic reflex was tested by increasing contralateral noise intensity, and toluene injected into the carotid artery was used to study physiological efficacy. Results showed that the protective effect of the OC reflex is intensity dependent. In addition, the OC reflex was found to be less sensitive to toluene than the middle ear acoustic reflex. This may be because the efferent neurons involved in inner ear and middle ear reflexes are located differently. In conclusion, the synergistic effects on hearing of co-exposure to noise and aromatic solvents are because of solvents depressing the central nuclei, which mainly drive the middle ear acoustic reflex.
To better understand species differences in cisplatin nephrotoxicity, we focused on renal cysteine-S-conjugate β-lyase (C-S lyase), which may play a crucial role in the metabolism of platinum (Pt)-cysteine conjugates. Aminooxyacetic acid hemihydrochloride (AOAA), an inhibitor of C-S lyase, reduced renal injuries due to cisplatin in rats, suggesting involvement of C-S lyase. On day 5 following a bolus cisplatin injection, three species showed in vivo nephrotoxic potentials in the order of rats>mice=rabbits (the highest to lowest), based on body surface. The levels of renal Pt residue at the nephrotoxic dose were in order of rabbits>rats>mice. Meanwhile, the activity of endogenous (basal) mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (AST), one of the C-S lyases, in the renal cortex of naive animals was rats>mice=rabbits. In a qualitative Western blot analysis, expression of mitochondrial C-S lyase in the kidney was observed at approximately 37kDa in all five species used. In in vitro studies, the cytotoxicity of cisplatin was dependent on the expression level of C-S lyase mRNA in the respective renal cells. These results demonstrate that species differences in cisplatin nephrotoxicity are attributable to an interaction of renal Pt transition with C-S lyase activity.
Chloroquine plus proguanil is widely used for malaria chemoprophylaxis despite low effectiveness in areas where multidrug-resistant malaria occurs. Studies have shown that atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride is safe and effective for prevention of falciparum malaria in lifelong residents of malaria-endemic countries, but little is known about non-immune travellers.
In a double-blind equivalence trial, 1083 participants travelling to a malaria-endemic area were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: atovaquone-proguanil plus placebos for chloroquine and proguanil, or chloroquine, proguanil, and placebo for atovaquone-proguanil. Follow-up was by telephone 7 and 60 days after travel and at a clinic at 28 days. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to a malaria circumsporozoite protein. Blood and serum samples of participants with a potential malaria diagnosis were tested in a reference laboratory.
7 days after travel, at least one adverse event was reported by 311 (61%) of 511 participants who received atovaquone-proguanil and 329 (64%) of 511 who received chloroquine-proguanil. People receiving atovaquone-proguanil had a lower frequency of treatment-related gastrointestinal adverse events (59 [12%] vs 100 [20%], p=0.001), and of treatment-related adverse events of moderate or severe intensity (37 [7%] vs 56 [11%], p=0.05). There were fewer treatment-related adverse events that caused prophylaxis to be discontinued in the atovaquone-proguanil group than in the chloroquine-proguanil group (one [0.2%] vs ten [2%], p=0.015).
Overall the two preparations were similarly tolerated. However, significantly fewer adverse gastrointestinal events were observed in the atovaquone-proguanil group in than in the chloroquine-proguanil group.
In a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study of 194 patients with moderate hypertension, spironolactone and nifedipine were found to reduce blood pressure (BP) to about the same extent and in the same percentage of patients after 45 days of treatment (47 and 50%, respectively). At that point, the patients controlled by either drug continued on their regimen for another 45 days, while patients whose BP was still elevated (diastolic BP greater than 90 mm Hg), received the other drug in addition. After 45 days of combination therapy, 63% of the patients had normal BP, whereas those receiving monotherapy largely remained normotensive (96% in the spironolactone group and 88% in the nifedipine group). The adverse effects were not severe with either group, but the incidence was markedly higher in the nifedipine group.
Two patients experienced acute transient hepatic and renal failure following ingestion of substantial but less than the usually toxic doses of acetaminophen, in both cases associated with heavy acute alcohol intake. One patient developed transient clinical features of chronic active liver disease one month later. Liver biopsy specimens from both patients taken after the acute episodes revealed, in addition to the well recognized centrilobular hepatic injury of acetaminophen, unusual portal tract lesions, which resembled chronic active hepatitis in one case. In some patients therapeutic doses of acetaminophen, if taken together with alcohol, may produce acute and chronic liver disease.
Most reports of drug induced meningitis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have implicated ibuprofen. We describe a 46-year-old woman with SLE who developed aseptic meningitis abruptly after ingesting trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole (TMP-SMX). This patient had received TMP-SMX twice before; each was associated with increasingly severe reactions, whose relationship with the use of TMP-SMX became apparent only in retrospect. A history of medication use should be sought in all patients with meningitis who have an underlying autoimmune disorder.
Among neuroeosinophilic syndromes, neuromuscular disorders are considered as a special group, including perimyosistis, polymyositis and fasciitis. These three disorders are considered as a continuum. They usually without a recognized cause, and are considered to be spontaneous or exercise-induced. We report the case of a 43 year-old woman who experienced angioedema followed by an histologically proven-fasciitis with eosinophilia after Ramipril (Triatec) use. Causal attribution to Ramipril was considered "plausible". To our knowledge this side effect has never been reported with this drug.
We describe a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed hypersensitivity after 3 weeks of therapy with azathioprine with fever, jaundice and renal insufficiency. A percutaneous liver biopsy was compatible with hypersensitivity hepatitis. During azathioprine rechallenge, the symptoms recurred within a few days, consistent with the diagnosis of an acute hypersensitivity reaction. This report is the first to describe the association of an azathioprine induced hypersensitivity simultaneously involving the liver and the kidneys, in the same patient with RA, with resurgence after rechallenge.
Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is successfully used in acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation (STEMI). Reocclusions follow rt-PA treatment in up to 30% of patients within one year. The infusion of rt-PA may induce the production of anti-t-PA antibodies which could interfere with the function of the native t-PA molecule.
In order to detect and characterise anti-t-PA antibodies, plasma samples were collected from 30 STEMI patients (20 treated and 10 not treated with rt-PA) at baseline before rt-PA infusion and then 15, 30, 90 and 180 days after STEMI and from 40 healthy subjects at baseline only. Immunoenzymatic, chromatographic and chromogenic methods were employed.
An increase of anti-t-PA antibodies was observed 15 days (IgM, p=0.0001) and 30 days (IgG, p=0.0001) after rt-PA infusion. Six patients had large increases of anti-t-PA IgG which bound the catalytic domain of t-PA (two cases) or kringle 2 domain (four cases), were of IgG1 or IgG3 subclasses and interacted with the t-PA molecule in fluid phase.
The infusion of rt-PA may induce the production of specific antibodies that bind active sites of t-PA, thus potentially reducing its in vivo function.
