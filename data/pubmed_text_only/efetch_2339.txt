The incidence and severity of muscle pains and changes in creatine kinase were assessed following administration of 1 mg.kg-1 suxamethonium either immediately or 2 min after induction of anaesthesia with propofol or thiopentone in patients undergoing elective dental and ophthalmic surgery. The incidence of muscle pains was 35 and 60% respectively in the groups given suxamethonium immediately and 2 min after propofol, and 35 and 55% when given immediately and 2 min after thiopentone, with no statistically significant differences among the groups. Creatine kinase levels increased in all the groups after operation with the least average increase in the group receiving suxamethonium immediately after propofol and the highest increase in the group receiving suxamethonium 2 min after thiopentone. There was no correlation between the incidence and severity of fasciculations, muscle pains and changes in creatine kinase within or between the groups. It is concluded that neither the induction agent nor the time between the induction agent and suxamethonium administration has any significant influence on the incidence of muscle pains or creatine kinase elevation following suxamethonium.
The neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine (METH) on striatal dopaminergic neurons have been hypothesized to be mediated by excess dopamine (DA) release. In addition, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists block METH-induced DA depletions. This suggests that glutamate also mediates the toxic effects of METH. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that DA and glutamate efflux contribute to METH-induced neurotoxicity. In vivo microdialysis in rats was used to measure extracellular concentrations of striatal DA and glutamate following 3 injections of METH (10 mg/kg, i.p.), each injection given 2 hours apart. One week following the dialysis experiment, rats were sacrificed and the ventral lateral striata were assayed for DA content. Glutamate concentrations in the dialysate increased by over 4-fold after the third METH injection. In these same animals, striatal DA tissue content was significantly depleted. In separate groups of rats, pretreatment with haloperidol (2 mg/kg at the first METH injection) significantly increased METH-induced DA efflux. The haloperidol pretreatment attenuated the extracellular increase in glutamate produced by METH and blocked subsequent neurotoxicity to DA neurons. In contrast, pretreatment with the DA uptake blocker, GBR-12909 (10 mg/kg, 30 min before each METH injection) significantly attenuated the increased DA release produced by METH but did not change glutamate efflux. However, pretreatment with GBR-12909 did protect against the tissue content depletion of DA in the striatum. Based on these findings, it appears that increased DA and glutamate release in the striatum are important and possibly interact in the development of METH-induced neurotoxicity.
While the combination chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin (AUC 5-6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over 3 h) is widely employed in the treatment of ovarian cancer, there are limited data available in the oncologic literature regarding the neurotoxic potential of the program. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 87 patients treated in the Gynecologic Cancer Program of the Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center to address this important clinical issue. The overall incidence of peripheral neuropathy in this population was 25%, with 13% of women experiencing symptoms > or = grade 2 in severity. We conclude that while neurotoxicity is common following the use of this regimen, significant neurological dysfunction (> or = grade 2) is relatively infrequent.
Computed Tomography (CT) was used to assess lateral ventricular size in 20 psychiatric inpatients who had participated in at least 5 weeks of a fixed dose chlorpromazine (CPZ) trial. During treatment with CPZ, eight patients had required antiparkinsonian medication for treatment of rigidity. The ventricular brain ratio (VBR) of these eight patients was greater than that of either the 12 patients who did not require antiparkinsonian medication or a similarly aged control group of neurological patients, scanned for tension or migraine headaches. On the basis of these findings it is suggested that large lateral ventricular size may be associated with increased vulnerability to develop drug-induced parkinsonism.
Pulmonary toxicology studies in rats demonstrate that nanoparticles are more toxic than fine-sized particles of similar chemistry. This study, however, provides evidence to contradict this theory. The aims of the study were (1) to compare the toxicity of synthetic 50 nm nanoquartz I particles versus (mined) Min-U-Sil quartz ( approximately 500 nm); the toxicity of synthetic 12 nm nanoquartz II particles versus (mined) Min-U-Sil ( approximately 500 nm) versus (synthetic) fine-quartz particles (300 nm); and (2) to evaluate the surface activities among the samples as they relate to toxicity. Well-characterized samples were tested for surface activity and hemolytic potential. In addition, groups of rats were instilled with either doses of 1 or 5 mg/kg of carbonyl iron (CI) or various alpha-quartz particle types in phosphate-buffered saline solution and subsequently assessed using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid biomarkers, cell proliferation, and histopathological evaluation of lung tissue at 24 h, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postexposure. Exposures to the various alpha-quartz particles produced differential degrees of pulmonary inflammation and cytotoxicity, which were not always consistent with particle size but correlated with surface activity, particularly hemolytic potential. Lung tissue evaluations of three of the quartz samples demonstrated "typical" quartz-related effects--dose-dependent lung inflammatory macrophage accumulation responses concomitant with early development of pulmonary fibrosis. The various alpha-quartz-related effects were similar qualitatively but with different potencies. The range of particle-related toxicities and histopathological effects in descending order were nanoscale quartz II = Min-U-Sil quartz > fine quartz > nanoscale quartz I > CI particles. The results demonstrate that the pulmonary toxicities of alpha-quartz particles appear to correlate better with surface activity than particle size and surface area.
The antibacterial effects of telavancin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against six Staphylococcus aureus strains (1 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] strain, 4 methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] strains, and 1 vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA] strain) and three Enterococcus sp. strains (1 Enterococcus faecalis strain, 1 Enterococcus faecium strain, and 1 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium [VREF] strain) were compared using an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection. Analyzing the data from all five vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) strains or all 4 MRSA strains showed that telavancin was superior in its antibacterial effect as measured by the area under the bacterial kill curve at 24 h (AUBKC(24)) and 48 h (AUBKC(48)) in comparison to vancomycin or teicoplanin (P < 0.05). Telavancin was also superior to vancomycin and teicoplanin in terms of its greater early killing effect (P < 0.05). Against the three Enterococcus spp. tested, telavancin was superior to vancomycin in terms of its AUBKC(24), AUBKC(48), and greater early bactericidal effect (P < 0.05). Dose-ranging studies were performed to provide free-drug area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC (fAUC/MIC) exposures from 0 to 1,617 (7 to 14 exposures per strain) for 5 VSSA, 4 VISA, and the 3 Enterococcus strains. The fAUC/MIC values for a 24-h bacteriostatic effect and a 1-log-unit drop in the viable count were 43.1 ± 38.4 and 50.0 ± 39.0 for VSSA, 3.2 ± 1.3 and 4.3 ± 1.3 for VISA, and 15.1 ± 8.8 and 40.1 ± 29.4 for the Enterococcus spp., respectively. The reason for the paradoxically low fAUC/MIC values for VISA strains is unknown. There was emergence of resistance to telavancin in the dose-ranging studies, as indicated by subpopulations able to grow on plates containing 2× MIC telavancin concentrations compared to the preexposure population analysis profiles. Changes in population analysis profiles were less likely with enterococci than with S. aureus, and the greatest risk of changed profiles occurred for both species at fAUC/MIC ratios of 1 to 10. Maintaining a fAUC/MIC ratio of >50 reduced the risk of subpopulations able to grow on antibiotic-containing media emerging. These data help explain the clinical effectiveness of telavancin against MRSA and indicate that telavancin may have clinically useful activity against Enterococcus spp., and perhaps also VISA, at human doses of 10 mg/kg of body weight/day. In addition, they support a clinical breakpoint of sensitive at ≤1 mg/liter for both S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
Tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2), the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT synthesis in the brain, is a candidate for participation in a mechanism mediating the antidepressant effect of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine. Using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and semi-quantitative RT-PCR techniques, we have examined the effects of fluoxetine administration with drinking water (7.5 mg/kg/day) for 2, 4 and 8 weeks on TPH2 mRNA expression in the midbrain part of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and in the brainstem containing the rest of the raphe complex. Fluoxetine treatment for 4 and 8 weeks significantly increased basal TPH2 mRNA levels in the midbrain, an effect that was correlated with the appearance of antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test. A significant induction of TPH2 and 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) mRNAs was detected in the midbrain of untreated rats 24 h after the swim test. In these animals, the swim test also produced a marked decrease in 5-HT metabolite (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)) content in the amygdala. Fluoxetine treatment for 4 and 8, but not for 2 weeks, abolished these swim-induced changes in TPH2 and 5-HTT mRNAs levels in the midbrain and 5-HIAA content in the amygdala. The results of the present study suggest that TPH2 gene expression in the midbrain part of the DRN is implicated in depression and stress response, as well as in the antidepressant fluoxetine action.
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been found to cause several tumor types in rodents, but TCDD has not been proven to cause cancer in humans, although there have been reported associations. TCDD does not bind to DNA, and indirect tests for DNA damage have been mostly negative. Tumorigenicity by TCDD in rodents has been linked to cellular necrosis, enhanced cell proliferation and tumor promotion. TCDD binds to the Ah receptor, which induces CYP1A1. This binding may be involved in tumorigenicity in rodents; however, additional TCDD-induced toxic changes appear to be required. Biopersistence and organ distribution may play an important role in TCDD dosage extrapolation to humans, but these have not been adequately determined.
In 36 unselected patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease taking 4.5-6 gm. salicylazosulfapyridine per day the incidence of hemolysis and its relation to the serum level of salicylazosulfapyridine (Salazopyrin, Azulfidline, SASP), free sulfapyridine (SP) and acetyl sulfapyridine (ac-SP) was investigated. In 19 patients hemolysis was present. Serum levels of free SP were significantly higher in these patients (P less than 0.001). All patients with a serum SP level higher than 37 microgram./ml. had hemolysis as compared to only four of 21 patients with a serum SP level below 37 microgram./ml. Four patients had evidence of hemolytic anemia. In these patients the serum SP level was higher than 55 microgram./ml. Eighteen of the 19 patients with hemolysis were slow acetylators while six of the 17 patients without hemolysis belonged to the slow acetylator phenotype.
Bisphosphonates (BPs), specific inhibitors of osteoclasts, are well established in the management of skeletal metastases in breast cancer. Recent studies have suggested that these compounds may also directly influence tumor cell proliferation. As adrenocortical cancer frequently leads to bone metastases, we investigated the effects of clodronate (CLO) in the human adrenocortical cancer cell line NCI-H295 and in primary cultures of bovine adrenocortical cells. Both the non-amino BP CLO and the amino BP pamidronate (PAM) exhibited a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect in both cell types (cell viability in NCI-H295 cells: 100 microM CLO: 98+/-8%; 500 microM CLO 76+/-6%; 1000 microM CLO 53+/-2; 10 microM PAM 96+/-3%; 50 microM PAM 46+/-6%; 100 microM PAM 11+/-1% vs untreated control cells: 100+/-10%; P<0.01). FACS analysis in NCI-H295 cells treated with either CLO or PAM demonstrated both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. However, while during PAM treatment cell number and hormone secretion decreased in parallel, we observed specific impairment of steroidogenesis in the presence of CLO with a dose-dependent increase in the 17-OH-progesterone/cortisol ratio (100 microM CLO 134+/-30%; 500 microM CLO 284+/-10%; 1000 microM CLO 545+/-130% vs 100+/-20% in control cells; P<0.01). Further analysis in ACTH-stimulated bovine adrenal cells using stable isotope dilution/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated CLO-induced inhibition of adrenal 21-hydroxylase (P450c21) activity leading to a dose-dependent increase in the 17-OH-progesterone/11-deoxycortisol ratio. In conclusion, we demonstrate a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect of CLO and PAM in adrenocortical cells. In addition, for the first time, we describe a suppressive effect of CLO on steroidogenesis via inhibition of adrenal 21-hydroxylase (P450c21) activity.
Day-night differences in locomotor and anxiety-related behavior and brain serotonin metabolism were examined in adult Syrian hamsters that received clomipramine (15 mg/kg) or vehicle from day 8 to day 21 of life. Locomotor activity was significantly greater at the beginning of scotophase (20.00 h) than at noon (12.00 h) and it was highest in hamsters treated with clomipramine at both examined times. Significant day-night differences in anxiety-related behavior, as measured in a plus-maze paradigm, were found in saline-treated hamsters only, with higher values at night. Clomipramine-treated hamsters exhibited augmented 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/serotonin ratio in hypothalamus and midbrain raphe, while serotonin content decreased in frontal cortex and hypothalamic areas. The results indicate that neonatal clomipramine treatment produces a long-lasting change in locomotion and anxiety-related behavior, as well as reduces brain serotonin content in hamsters.
The acute effects of nifedipine withdrawal were studied in 81 patients with angina at rest who had completed a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial of nifedipine versus placebo. Thirty-nine of the 81 patients (group 1) were withdrawn from nifedipine or placebo at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery for uncontrolled angina or left main coronary artery disease. When the patients withdrawn from nifedipine were compared with those withdrawn from placebo, no significant differences were seen in the incidence of hypotension, myocardial infarction, significant arrhythmias or vasopressor or vasodilator requirements during the perioperative period. Forty-two patients (group 2) completed 2 years on a protocol consisting of nitrates and propranolol, in addition to nifedipine or placebo. These patients were hospitalized for a controlled withdrawal of the study drug (nifedipine or placebo), and no significant difference was noted in either exercise performance on serial treadmill testing or the number or duration of episodes of ischemic ST-segment changes during continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Eight patients continued to experience occasional episodes of angina at rest. Angina at rest recurred during the withdrawal period in 5 of these 8 patients. Four of these 5 patients were withdrawn from nifedipine. Of the 34 stable patients in group 2 who were not experiencing angina at rest before withdrawal, none had angina at rest during the withdrawal study period. Thus, there were no early untoward effects of acute nifedipine withdrawal either in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery or in stable patients on long-term medical therapy. However, patients with persistent symptoms of angina at rest may experience early recurrent ischemia upon withdrawal from nifedipine.
Administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine (1.5 or 2 mg/kg, i.v.) to rats elicited a marked decrease of mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) leading to death (in 67% or 90% of animals respectively). Intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist BN 52021 (10 mg/kg), 30 min before bupivacaine administration (2 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR. In contrast, doses of 1 mg/kg BN 52021 given 30 min before or 10 mg/kg administered 5 min before i.v. injection of bupivacaine were ineffective. When BN 52021 (20 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after bupivacaine (2 mg/kg), a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective. A partial recovery of bupivacaine-induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with BN 52021. Since the administration of BN 52021, at all doses studied, did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of BN 52021, a specific antagonist of PAF, against bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity. Thus, consistent with its direct effect on heart, PAF appears to be implicated in bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular alterations.
A 76 year old woman presented with a quadriparesis associated with hyperkalaemia. She had a 10 month history of treatment with oral diclofenac sodium. On admission she had hyperkalaemic metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap and mild renal impairment. Her weakness resolved after withdrawal of diclofenac and medical correction of her hyperkalaemia. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are known to cause hyperkalaemic acidosis and should be used with caution, especially in the presence of renal impairment.
A 65-year-old male with a long history of congestive heart failure presented to the emergency room with facial swelling 7 h after the first dose of enalapril. He was treated with diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone which improved his angioedema. However, there was a profound relapse of the angioedema followed by respiratory arrest. He suffered severe anoxic brain damage and died five days later. It is likely that the long half-life of enalapril lead to this rebound phenomenon. Enalapril induced angioedema is reviewed with suggestions for management.
In a quantitative overview of published trials, we investigated whether pharmacologic properties of antihypertensive drugs, as opposed to reduction in blood pressure, explain cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive or high-risk patients. We used meta-regression to investigate the association between the odds ratios of outcome (experimental vs. reference treatment) and the corresponding blood pressure differences between study groups. Thus, we correlated odds ratios with between-group differences in systolic pressure. We then compared odds ratios of benefit observed in recent trials with those predicted by meta-regression on the basis of the differences in systolic pressure between randomized groups. Among nine actively-controlled trials in hypertension, significant differences in systolic pressure (follow-up minus baseline) between randomized groups (experimental minus reference) were observed in the ALLHAT, CAPPP, MIDAS, and NORDIL trials. Furthermore, the differences in achieved systolic and/or diastolic pressure between study groups were also significant in the hypertension trials and studies in high-risk patients, which involved untreated control patients. The differences between the observed odds ratios and those predicted by meta-regression did not reach statistical significance except for NORDIL and the single-drug therapy subgroup of the PROGRESS trial. In NORDIL, the risk of stroke was lower on diltiazem than on the older drug classes despite a 3.1 mm Hg higher systolic pressure on the calcium channel blocker. In PROGRESS, perindopril alone reduced blood pressure by 5/3 mm Hg, but did not affect the incidence of all cardiovascular events or the recurrence of stroke. In conclusion, the finding that in the reviewed trials blood pressure reduction largely accounted for outcome emphasizes the desirability of tight blood pressure control. The hypothesis that blood pressure-lowering medications might influence cardiovascular prognosis over and beyond their antihypertensive effect remains to a large extent unproved.
Hypertension and arthritis are both common diseases in the older age group and require pharmacologic treatment. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alter renal function if given in high enough doses, reducing renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate and causing sodium retention. In salt sensitive subjects, this retention of sodium will cause blood pressure to rise. Salt sensitivity is more common in elderly patients, in diabetics, and in people with renal failure. When most antihypertensive drugs are used, people become salt sensitive, as shown by the additive effect of salt restriction or diuretics on blood pressure response. The responses to dihydropyridine and possibly other calcium channel blocking drugs are not affected to any major extent by sodium intake or by diuretics. Studies are described which indicate that indomethacin elevates blood pressure in elderly people treated with enalapril, but not in people whose blood pressure is controlled with amlodipine or felodipine. It is unclear whether the various NSAIDs have different effects on blood pressure. It is proposed that if the same analgesic effect is achieved with the same amount of cyclooxygenase inhibition, the response will be similar. Aspirin, used in a prophylactic dose, does not inhibit to this extent and does not elevate blood pressure. If elderly people require NSAIDs, it would appear that dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking drugs are more effective at lowering and maintaining blood pressure control and should be one of the drugs used. If patients are on other antihypertensive agents, it is important to monitor blood pressure when a NSAID is added to therapy.
Three patients who developed renal papillary necrosis while receiving long-term, high-dose aspirin therapy for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis are presented. It appears that aspirin alone or aspirin in combination with other drugs is the causative agent. The incidence and biologic significance of renal papillary necrosis are insufficient to alter the use of aspirin as the drug of choice in management of JRA. It is recommended that all children with JRA be encouraged to drink ample fluids and be followed with periodic urinalysis and blood pressure measurements. Those children who develop hematuria or hypertension should be evaluated by excretory urography.
To study the effect of bicyclol on lipid disorder and liver damage induced by tetracycline in mice, mice were given (ig) bicyclol (75, 150, and 300 mg x kg(-1)) three times before or after administration of tetracycline (180 mg x kg(-1)). The contents of hepatic lipids, MDA and GSH, serum lipids and ALT/AST levels were measured 24 hours after the injection (ip) of tetracycline. The beta-oxidation rate of hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid and hepatic secretion of VLDL were also observed. Bicyclol (150 and 300 mg x kg(-1)) provided significant protection against fatty liver by inhibiting the elevation of hepatic TG and CHO, adjusting abnormal serum lipids, inhibiting the elevation of serum ALT, AST, and ameliorating the severity of pathological changes. Furthermore, bicyclol significantly accelerated the VLDL (TG) secretion and reversed the impairment of mitochondrial oxidation, resulting in the lipid homeostasis. The increase of MDA formation and depletion of GSH that reflect lipid peroxidation induced by tetracycline were also inhibited by bicyclol administration. The results indicated that the hepatoprotection of bicyclol was mostly due to the improvement on lipid oxidation and transportation as well as the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in tetracycline-intoxicated mice.
Glioblastomas, the most common primary gliomas, are characterized by increased invasion and difficult therapy. Major clinical medicines for treating gliomas merely extend the survival time for a number of months. Therefore, development of new agents against gliomas is important. Autophagy, a process for degrading damaged organelles and proteins, is an adaptive response to environmental stress. However, the role of autophagy in glioblastoma development still needs to be further investigated. Evodiamine, a major alkaloid isolated from Evodia rutaecarpa Bentham, has various pharmacological activities, such as inhibiting tumor growth and metastatic properties. However, the effects of evodiamine on glioblastomas and their detailed molecular mechanisms and autophagy formation are not well understood. In this study, we observed that evodiamine induced dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in glioma cells. Blockade of calcium channels in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) significantly reduced evodiamine-induced cytosolic calcium elevation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial depolarization, which suggests that evodiamine induces a calcium-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Interestingly, autophagy was also enhanced by evodiamine, and had reached a plateau by 24h. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy resulted in increased apoptosis and reduced cell viability. Inhibition of ER calcium channel activation also significantly reduced evodiamine-induced autophagy. Inactivation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) suppressed evodiamine-mediated autophagy accompanied by increased apoptosis. Furthermore, evodiamine-mediated JNK activation was abolished by BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium scavenger, suggesting that evodiamine mediates autophagy via a calcium-JNK signaling pathway. Collectively, these results suggest that evodiamine induces intracellular calcium/JNK signaling-mediated autophagy and calcium/mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in glioma cells.
Adolescents infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often confront the clinician with difficult medical problems. Besides the host of opportunistic infections, which can affect these patients, side effects from medications can be frequent and, at times, life-threatening. We report a case of aseptic meningitis secondary to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii in an HIV-infected adolescent.
This study examined the effects of arsenic trioxide on apoptosis and interleukin-4 release in T cells of asthmatic patients in vitro and investigated the role of Bcl-2 in the active mechanism. T cells were isolated from asthmatic patients (n = 21) and healthy controls (n = 20), and then treated with arsenic trioxide and dexamethasone. Cell apoptosis was measured using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and a cytochrome c ELISA kit. Interleukin-4 levels in the serum and in supernatants from T cells were quantified by ELISA. Flow cytometric analysis and immunofluorescence studies were performed to determine Bcl-2 expression. T cells of the asthmatic patients (i. e. without treatment) exhibited decelerated spontaneous apoptosis after 24 h incubation in vitro when compared to T cells of the healthy controls. With dexamethasone treatment, an increase in apoptosis of T cells was not significantly different between both groups, irrespective of the method used. Arsenic trioxide treatment, however, significantly increased the apoptosis of T cells of the asthmatic group and showed a slight effect on the control group. In asthmatic patients, elevated levels of interleukin-4 and up-regulated Bcl-2 expression were detected. Moreover, in vitro, T cells of asthmatic patients spontaneously released more interleukin-4 and exhibited more Bcl-2 expression than T cells from the control group. Arsenic trioxide treatment significantly decreased interleukin-4 release and down-regulated Bcl-2 expression in asthmatic patients, while it only slightly affected healthy controls. Dexamethasone treatment decreased interleukin-4 release in both groups examined. It did not significantly influence Bcl-2 expression. These results suggest that arsenic trioxide induces T cell apoptosis and decreases interleukin-4 release in T cells of asthmatic patients in vitro and that down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression may be an important mechanism.
The effects of intravenous administration of melatonin (30-60 mg/kg) or vehicle (10% alcohol) on arterial pressure, heart rate, blood gases or brain serotonin release were assessed in rats under urethane anesthesia. Administration of melatonin, but not the vehicle, produced a dose-related fall in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, or serotonin release in both the corpus striatum and the hypothalamus. Melatonin treatment had an insignificant effect on either PaCO2, PaO2 or pH. In addition, the melatonin-induced depressor responses were abolished by pretreatment with spinal transection, whereas melatonin-induced bradycardia was abolished by pretreatment with bilateral vagotomy. These results suggest that melatonin decreases brain serotonin release and results in sympathetic inhibition or parasympathetic stimulation which leads to hypotension and bradycardia in rats.
This study determined whether nickel sulfate (Ni)-induced reproductive damage occurs via apoptosis and oxidative stress and to examine the expression of Bax and c-kit and their effects on Ni exposure. The study also explored the protective effects of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) against Ni toxicity in the testes. Wistar rats were treated with normal saline, Ni alone (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day), and Ni (2.5 mg/kg/day) plus GSPE (50 and 100 mg/kg/day). After 30 days, Ni significantly decreased sperm motility and the percentage of S-phase cells and enhanced testicular apoptosis in the 2.5 and 5 mg groups. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), and nitric oxide (NO) significantly increased. The decreased activity of glutathione peroxidase and catalase in the Ni groups showed that Ni could increase oxidative stress, especially at 2.5 and 5 mg. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of Bax protein and c-kit increased in 2.5 and 5 mg Ni groups compared with controls. Conversely, these changes were partially attenuated in rats simultaneously administered GSPE, especially in the 100 mg group. These results demonstrate the following: (1) Ni exhibits reproductive toxicity in rats by decreasing sperm at concentrations of 2.5 and 5 mg; (2) intratesticular apoptosis, oxidative stress, and c-kit overexpression play pivotal roles in reproductive damage induced by Ni; and (3) GSPE enhances sperm motility by down-regulating c-kit expression and offsetting the apoptosis and oxidative stress induced by Ni by directly decreasing MDA and NO, scavenging H₂O₂, and down-regulating Bax expression.
Oesophageal injury is a well recognized complication of certain oral medications but warfarin has not been implicated previously. We present a case of an oesophageal ulcer occurring in a patient with mitral regurgitation taking warfarin, and demonstrate a delayed oesophageal tablet transit time.
A 43-year-old woman was admitted after a suicide attempt with 1.5 g atenolol. Physical and neurological examination showed no abnormality, but psychiatric examination revealed symptoms of a major depression. Four weeks prior to admission a valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination had been added to the antihypertensive medication.
Laboratory tests, electrocardiography, chest-x-ray, electroencephalography and cranial computerised tomography showed no abnormality.
The depressive disorder resolved within ten days after discontinuation of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide without specific treatment. Blood pressure was normal under treatment with metoprolol.
Depressive drug reactions can produce a substantial morbidity. This case of a drug induced affective disorder should heighten the awareness of unusual reactions to valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide therapy.
