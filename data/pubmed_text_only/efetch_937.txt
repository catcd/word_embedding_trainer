Sodium arsenite (NaAs)-induced autophagic cell death (ACD) of a mouse renal tubular epithelial cell line (mProx24), which expresses enhanced levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), was reduced by the suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine or Atg7 knockdown. The inhibition of the IL-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signal pathway by anti-IL-6 antibody or a Jak2 inhibitor (AG490) exaggerated ACD of mProx24 cells after NaAs challenge, attenuating STAT3 activation and reciprocally enhancing extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. In contrast, an ERK inhibitor, PD98059, reduced NaAs-induced ACD in mProx24 cells. Subcutaneous injection of NaAs (12.5 mg/kg) into BALB/c (wild-type) mice enhanced intrarenal expression of IL-6, mainly produced by tubular cells, and caused severe renal injury characterized by hemorrhages, acute tubular necrosis, cast formation, and brush border disappearance, with increases in serum urea nitrogen (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine levels. In addition, IL-6-deficient (IL-6(-/-)) mice exhibited exaggerated histopathological changes with higher blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Moreover, in IL-6(-/-) mice treated with NaAs, ACD in renal tubular cells was significantly augmented, along with diminished STAT3 activation and reciprocal enhancement of ERK signaling, compared with wild-type mice. Finally, the administration of exogenous IL-6 into wild-type mice significantly reduced NaAs-induced ACD along with diminished ERK activation and eventually alleviated acute renal dysfunction. Thus, IL-6/STAT3 signal pathway could inhibit ERK activation, a crucial step for ACD, eventually attenuating NaAs-induced renal dysfunction.
Understanding the physiopathology of affective disorders and their treatment relies on the availability of experimental models that accurately mimic aspects of the disease. Here we describe a mouse model of an anxiety/depressive-like state induced by chronic corticosterone treatment. Furthermore, chronic antidepressant treatment reversed the behavioral dysfunctions and the inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis induced by corticosterone treatment. In corticosterone-treated mice where hippocampal neurogenesis is abolished by X-irradiation, the efficacy of fluoxetine is blocked in some, but not all, behavioral paradigms, suggesting both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms of antidepressant action. Finally, we identified a number of candidate genes, the expression of which is decreased by chronic corticosterone and normalized by chronic fluoxetine treatment selectively in the hypothalamus. Importantly, mice deficient in one of these genes, beta-arrestin 2, displayed a reduced response to fluoxetine in multiple tasks, suggesting that beta-arrestin signaling is necessary for the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine.
To investigate the predictive value of Ki67 and p53 and their correlation with thymidylate synthase (TS) gene expression in a rectal cancer patient cohort treated according to a standardized recommended neoadjuvant treatment regimen.
Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded pre-therapeutical tumor biopsies (n = 22) and post-therapeutical resection specimens (n = 40) from patients with rectal adenocarcinoma (clinical UICC stage II/III) receiving standardized neoadjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemoradiotherapy were studied for Ki67 and p53 expression by immunohistochemistry and correlated with TS mRNA expression by quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR after laser microdissection. The results were compared with histopathological tumor regression according to a standardized semiquantitative score grading system.
Responders (patients with high tumor regression) showed a significantly lower Ki67 expression than non-responders in the pre-therapeutical tumor biopsies (81.2% vs 16.7%; P < 0.05) as well as in the post-therapeutical resection specimens (75.8% vs 14.3%; P < 0.01). High TS mRNA expression was significantly correlated with a high Ki67 index and low TS mRNA expression was significantly correlated with a low Ki67 index in the pre-therapeutical tumor biopsies (corr. coef. = 0.46; P < 0.01) as well as in the post-therapeutical resection specimens (corr. coef. = 0.40; P < 0.05). No significant association was found between p53 and TS mRNA expression or tumor regression.
Ki67 has, like TS, predictive value in rectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant 5-FU based chemoradiotherapy. The close correlation between Ki67 and TS indicates that TS is involved in active cell cycle processes.
The possible involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in nicotine's effect on impairment of memory by morphine was investigated. A passive avoidance task was used for memory assessment in male Wistar rats. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of morphine (5 and 10 mg/kg) after training impaired memory performance in the animals when tested 24 h later. Pretest administration of the same doses of morphine reversed impairment of memory because of post-training administration of the opioid. Moreover, administration of nicotine (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, s.c.) before the test prevented impairment of memory by morphine (5 mg/kg) given after training. Impairment of memory performance in the animals because of post-training administration of morphine (5 mg/kg) was also prevented by pretest administration of a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (0.75 and 1 microg/rat). Interestingly, an ineffective dose of MK-801 (0.5 microg/rat) in combination with low doses (0.075 and 0.1 mg/kg) of nicotine, which had no effects alone, synergistically improved memory performance impaired by morphine given after training. On the other hand, pretest administration of NMDA (0.1 and 0.5 microg/rat), which had no effect alone, in combination with an effective dose (0.4 mg/kg, s.c.) of nicotine prevented the improving effect of nicotine on memory impaired by pretreatment morphine. The results suggest a possible role for NMDA receptors of the NAc in the improving effect of nicotine on the morphine-induced amnesia.
Clinical evidence points to a role for angiotensin II (Ang II) in the post-infarction remodelling of cardiac hypertrophy. The present study was designed to investigate the remodelling process in an animal model of myocardial infarction (MI) using the following criteria: 1) histological studies to examine the re-vascularisation process and collagen deposition in different regions of the myocardium; 2) histological evidence to investigate the cell type distribution using cell-specific markers; 3) histological and Western blot analysis to localise Ang II receptor subtypes (AT(1)-receptor and AT(2)-receptor) and to study their regulation; 4) kinetics of the binding of Ang II to its receptors in a heart perfusion model; and 5) to assess the effect of the Ang II antagonist (losartan) on these parameters. MI was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery of Sprague-Dawley rats. Four different animal groups were established: 1) sham-operated, non-treated; 2) sham-operated, treated with losartan; 3) myocardial infarct, non-treated; and 4) myocardial infarct, treated with losartan. In infarcted rat hearts, fibroblasts and collagen types I and III increased in the remnant viable region of the left ventricle compared with sham-operated rats. One month of losartan treatment in myocardial infarcted rats revealed insignificant changes in fibroblasts and collagen types I and III compared with sham controls. Also, myocardial infarction increased AT(1)-receptor protein levels compared with sham-operated controls, as judged by Western blotting. In losartan-treated myocardial infarct animals, no changes were detected at the level of AT(1)-receptor expression compared with non-treated myocardial infarct rats. Binding studies of Ang II on endothelial cell lining and directly on myocytes in sham-operated and infarcted perfused rat hearts revealed that, in myocardial infarcted-animals, Ang II binding affinity increased both in the endothelium and in myofibres. This may be considered a major putative effect of the peptide in potentiating the pharmacodynamics of hypertrophy. In losartan-treated myocardial infarcted-animals, a marked increase in the binding affinities of Ang II for the AT(2)-receptor subtype was observed. Hence, potential cardioprotective effects of the AT(1)-receptor antagonist are proposed.
Mutations in the parkin gene, PARK2, are a common cause of parkinsonism in familial as well as isolated cases with an age of onset <40 years and should be considered in the diagnostic work up of young-onset parkinsonism. We report a detailed clinical evaluation of a personal series of 24 patients with mutations in the parkin gene. The clinical presentation of most cases was broadly comparable to that of previous descriptions of autosomal recessive early-onset or juvenile parkinsonism and young-onset Parkinson's disease and also had similarities with phenotypes of dopa-responsive dystonia. However, our only case with consanguineous parents had an age of onset of 54 years. We report three new phenotypes at presentation: cervical dystonia; autonomic dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy; and pure exercise-induced dystonia. We emphasize a number of clinical features that can be seen in parkin disease: focal dystonia; early instability; freezing; festination or retropulsion; concurrent autonomic failure; dramatic response to anticholinergics; early or atypical L-dopa-induced dyskinesias; exquisite sensitivity to small doses of L-dopa; and recurrent psychosis, even taking L-dopa alone. We also report behavioural disorder prior to the onset of parkinsonism. Some relatives carrying a single parkin mutation without extrapyramidal symptoms or signs also had psychiatric symptoms that might be related to their carrier status.
To report a case of marked hypotension resulting from the concomitant use of low-dose carvedilol and intravenous dobutamine.
A 54-year-old white man with severe heart failure was placed on carvedilol 3.125 mg orally twice a day; three days later the dosage was increased to 6.25 mg orally twice a day. His symptoms of heart failure worsened with increasing fluid retention, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. He was admitted for treatment of decompensated heart failure with intravenous dobutamine. With each increase in intravenous dobutamine, systolic blood pressure fell. Dobutamine was discontinued when systolic blood pressure reached 56 mm Hg. In a subsequent admission for decompensated heart failure, when the patient was not taking carvedilol, he was treated with intravenous dobutamine and systolic blood pressure increased.
Although carvedilol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist, at low doses it is a selective beta1-adrenergic antagonist. Dobutamine is a beta1-, beta2-, and alpha1-adrenergic agonist. Typically, patients with heart failure treated with intravenous dobutamine have a small increase in systolic blood pressure. We propose that the drop in blood pressure with dobutamine in this patient was caused by a fall in systemic vascular resistance due to vascular beta2-adrenergic receptor activation. The normal increase in cardiac output was partially blocked by selective beta1-adrenergic blockade at low doses of carvedilol.
Beta-adrenergic blockade with carvedilol is now common therapy for patients with congestive heart failure. Intravenous dobutamine is often used when these patients have worsening heart failure. Recognition that treatment with dobutamine in patients taking low doses of carvedilol may result in hypotension is important for appropriate monitoring and therapy.
We report the cases of 3 patients in whom ajmaline-induced acute hepatitis was followed by anicteric cholestasis persisting for more than 1 year after cessation of administration of the drug. Ajmaline was given for 8-16 days before the onset of acute hepatitis. Jaundice was preceded by fever, chills and abdominal pain, and was associated with hypereosinophilia. The initial lesions included centrilobular cholestasis and portal inflammatory infiltration. Jaundice lasted for 3 weeks to 11 months. In these 3 patients liver tests were still abnormal 17-26 months after ajmaline withdrawal; histological examination, performed 9-26 months after the onset of jaundice, showed a decreased number of interlobular bile ducts, ductular proliferation, and mild portal fibrosis; circulating immune complexes were demonstrated. These observations demonstrate that prolonged cholestasis can follow ajmaline-induced acute hepatitis. Persistence of cholestasis long after the withdrawal of ajmaline suggests some form of autoimmunity.
We compared the erectile response to intracavernous injection of a combination of papaverine and prostaglandin E1 with that of a combination of papaverine and phentolamine (49 patients), and prostaglandin E1 alone (38). The degree of erection achieved was significantly better with papaverine plus prostaglandin E1 than with papaverine plus phentolamine and the duration of erection was less, although the incidence of prolonged erections (greater than 5 hours) was similar with both combinations. Papaverine with prostaglandin E1 likewise resulted in a significantly better degree of erection than prostaglandin E1 alone (prolonged erections occurred only after the drug combination). All erections subsided spontaneously and none required medical intervention throughout the study. Pain was noted only after injection of prostaglandin E1. The incidence was clearly lower (7 of 38 versus 13 of 38) after the injection of only 5 micrograms. prostaglandin E1 in combination with papaverine (although the difference is not statistically significant). Subjectively, the side effects caused by the drug combination were described as much less dramatic by the patients than after prostaglandin E1 alone. The combination of papaverine and prostaglandin E1 shows a clearly synergistic effect and might suitably replace papaverine plus phentolamine or prostaglandin E1 alone in patients who do not respond well or suffer side effects after high single doses.
The authors record a new case of polynevritis through a prolonged use of perhexiline maleate. The acute neurological episode occurred 14 months after the beginning of the treatment when the daily doses had been raised to 600 mg for 2 months. The biopsy of the peripheral nerve was carried out only 27 months later as the posology was brought down to 200 mg and the clinical symptomatology had almost completely diminished. This probably accounts for the unusual aspects observed on semi-thin and ultrathin sections: a very remarkable reduction of the number of myelinated fibers and the severity of the phenomena of Wallerian degeneration, contrasting with the rarity of intra-cytoplasmic multilamellar schwannian inclusions, classically observed in the course of polynevritis caused by perhexiline maleate. The direct toxic action of the drug upon the neuron has been discussed.
Reported is a case of mesenteric venous thrombosis occurring in a 46-year-old woman who had taken an oral contraceptive for six years. Seventeen cases of mesenteric venous thrombosis have been reported in young women taking oral contraceptives. An association between oral contraceptive agents and mesenteric venous thrombosis is suggested.
Taraxacum officinale (L.) Weber, commonly known as Dandelion, has been widely used as a folkloric medicine for the treatment of liver and kidney disorders and some women diseases such as breast and uterus cancers. The main objective of the present study was to assess the efficiency of T. officinale leaf extract (TOE) in treating sodium dichromate hazards; it is a major environmental pollutant known for its wide toxic manifestations witch induced liver injury. TOE at a dose of 500 mg/kg b.w was orally administered once per day for 30 days consecutively, followed by 10 mg/kg b.w sodium dichromate was injected (intraperitoneal) for 10 days. Our results using Wistar rats showed that sodium dichromate significantly increased serum biochemical parameters. In the liver, it was found to induce an oxidative stress, evidenced from increase in lipid peroxidation and changes in antioxidative activities. In addition, histopathological observation revealed that sodium dichromate causes acute liver damage, necrosis of hepatocytes, as well as DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, animals that were pretreated with TOE, prior to sodium dichromate administration, showed a significant hepatoprotection, revealed by a significant reduction of sodium dichromate-induced oxidative damage for all tested markers. These finding powerfully supports that TOE was effective in the protection against sodium dichromate-induced hepatotoxicity and genotoxicity and, therefore, suggest a potential therapeutic use of this plant as an alternative medicine for patients with acute liver diseases. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from l-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and nitrite and nitrate are believed to be waste forms of NO. We previously reported an enzyme-independent pathway of NO generation from nitrite in acidic conditions. In this study, we show nitrite-derived NO formation in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In this experiment, we utilized a stable isotope of [(15)N]nitrite as a source of nitrite to distinguish l-arginine-derived NO from [(15)N]nitrite-derived (15)NO. Intravenous infusion of a stable isotope of [(15)N]nitrite ((15)NO(2)(-)) facilitated the formation of Hb(15)NO during renal ischemia, which demonstrated that the origin of NO was nitrite. The EPR signal of Hb(15)NO in kidney appeared after 40 min of renal ischemia, and renal reperfusion decreased the Hb(15)NO level in the kidney and increased it in blood by contrast. In addition, the amount of HbNO was nitrite concentration dependent, and this formation was NOS independent. Our findings suggest that nitrite can be an alternative source of NO in ischemic kidney and that it binds with hemoglobin and then is spread by the circulation after reperfusion.
The potential for addiction is thought to be greatest when drugs of abuse reach the brain rapidly, because this produces intense subjective pleasurable effects. However, the ability of drugs to induce forms of cellular plasticity related to behavioral sensitization may also contribute to addiction. Therefore, we studied the influence of rate of intravenous cocaine delivery on its ability to induce psychomotor sensitization. In one experiment, rotational behavior in rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion was used as an index of psychomotor activation, and in a second experiment, locomotor activity in neurologically intact rats was used. Rapid (5-16 sec) intravenous infusions of cocaine induced robust psychomotor sensitization at all doses tested (0.5-2.0 mg/kg). Treatments given over 25 sec failed to induce sensitization at all doses tested. Treatments given over 50 or 100 sec induced sensitization only at the highest dose tested. Thus, the rate of intravenous cocaine delivery has profound effects on the ability of cocaine to induce psychomotor sensitization. This suggests that the temporal dynamics of drug delivery to the brain is a critical factor in the ability of cocaine to induce forms of neuronal plasticity that may contribute to addiction.
A 33 year old female with systemic lupus erythematosus developed an aseptic meningitis with a polymorphonuclear CSF pleocytosis temporally correlated with ibuprofen. Several weeks later after one ibuprofen tablet this syndrome recurred. This represents the second report of this unusual manifestation and suggest an adverse reaction to ibuprofen in SLE patients.
The objective of this study is to evaluate in under developed country where post operative pain management inadequate the efficiency of the prevention of this acute tolerance with opioids by the ketamine.
We did a prospective study on months period (January 2004 to June 2004). The setting was the HPD surgical unit recovery room. The patients of more than 15 years and less than 60 years who underwent painful or fairly painful surgical operation under general anaesthesia were included. The patients intubés,ventilated and sedated in the recovery room were excluded from the study .The patients were divided into two groups: in group 1 the patients were given 100 microg/kg of ketamine 15 mn before induction. In group 2 the patients where given a placebo 15 mn before induction. The fentanyl was used systematically during induction at the dosage of 5 microg/kg. The quality of per-operative analgesia was evaluated by the appreciation of the heart rate and the blood pressure. The DPO was evaluated by the analogical visual scale (EV A) at the entrance and the exit of the recovery room, and at the 4th, 8th, 12th and 24th hour after the surgery.
Hundred and thirteen (113) patient were included in the study (groupel with ketamine: 56 patients, groupe 2 without ketamine: 57). The average age was 30 years with extremes from 16 to 60 years. In group 1 and preoperatively 5.9% of the patients receided additional fentanyl ranging from 50 to 100 microg/kg against 47.7% in group 2. In the post-operative period, the morphine consumption was 22.02% for the Group 1 and 43.37% for Group 2. The difference between the two groups is statistically significant. A case of restlessness was noted in group 1.
The low dose ketamine seems to be effective for the prevention of the postoperative severe pain induced by the fentanyl. It allows also an improvement of the quality of per-operational analgesia.
Blood pressure measurements were collected from 36 depressed geriatric outpatients (ages 55 to 81 years) enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of doxepin and imipramine. Mean systolic postural changes were 25.9 mm Hg for imipramine, significantly higher than the 10.5 mm Hg for doxepin, and 12.4 mm Hg for placebo. The orthostatic drop in the imipramine group was only weakly related to dose and did not correlate with amount of pretreatment orthostatic hypotension or with duration of treatment. The increased orthostatic hypotension occurred early in treatment and at low doses of imipramine. Accordingly, caution is advised in the use of imipramine for the elderly.
Antipsychotic medications have traditionally been used for their sedative effects in the management of the behavioral and emotional agitation of mania while awaiting the therapeutic effect of lithium. On the premise that a nonantipsychotic sedative might satisfactorily and more specifically control this agitation without neuroleptic or hypotensive side effects and without prolongation of the acute illness, the authors conducted an open trial with four acutely manic patients in which only the benzodiazepine lorazepam was administered along with lithium; no antipsychotic medications were used. Lorazepam, administered in oral and parenteral form on an as-needed basis to maintain patient cooperation with the treatment plan and milieu, was found to be rapid and effective in controlling the manic agitation of these patients, with few troublesome side effects, and with no obvious prolongation of the acute illness.
Toxicological evaluation of postmortem urine collected from a 41-year-old deceased white male detected anhydroecgonine ethyl ester (ethylecgonidine, AEEE), a transesterification product of smoked cocaine co-abused with ethanol. A solid phase extraction (SPE) method was used to extract cocaine, AEEE, and related metabolites from urine. SPE on a 1 mL urine sample from the decedent followed by GC-MS detected AEEE. Other metabolites identified by GC-MS included cocaine, cocaethylene, and anhydroecgonine methyl ester (AEME). To determine whether some or all of the AEEE was artifactually produced in the heated GC injector port, an alternative LC-MS method was developed. LC/MS following SPE found at least 50 ng/mL of AEEE in the extract. The mass fragmentation (MS/MS and MS3) of AEEE detected in the urine was compared to spectra of authentic, synthesized compound. AEEE is a potential additional forensic marker for the co-abuse of smoked cocaine and ethanol.
Substance abuse is extremely common in patients with bipolar disorders, although minimal data are available on the treatment of this important clinical population. Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved for the treatment of mania and that has a novel mechanism of action, acting as a dopamine-2 receptor partial agonist, thereby increasing dopamine release in some parts of the brain and decreasing dopa-mine release in other brain regions. Dopamine release is implicated in substance use, and both dopaminergic agonists and antagonists have been examined for the treatment of substance abuse. To our knowledge, dopa-mine receptor partial agonists have not been investigated for treatment of substance abuse in humans.
Twenty antipsychotic-treated patients with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder and current substance abuse were switched to open-label aripipra-zole using an overlap and taper method. At baseline, diagnoses were confirmed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview based on DSM-IV criteria. Psychiatric symptoms, side effects, and substance use and craving were assessed over 12 weeks. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Substance craving was assessed with visual analogue scales, and side effects were monitored using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, and patient report. Study enrollment was from April 2003 to February 2004.
Significant baseline-to-exit improvement in HAM-D (p = .002), YMRS (p = .021), and BPRS (p = .000) scores were observed without a significant change in antipsychotic-induced side effect scales. In 17 participants with current alcohol dependence, significant reductions in dollars spent on alcohol (p = .042) and alcohol craving (p = .003) were found. In 9 participants with cocaine-related disorders, significant reductions in cocaine craving (p = .014), but not use, were found.
A change to aripiprazole was associated with symptomatic improvement. Limitations of the study include a small sample size, high attrition, and an open-label design. Controlled trials in dual-diagnosis patients are needed to confirm these findings.
Sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) is the mainstay of treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar. In view of the increasing incidence of refractoriness to SAG in India, we compared the levels of parasite-specific IgG and IgG subclasses in 20 longitudinally followed up kala-azar patients. In both SAG-responsive (n = 10) and unresponsive patients (n = 10), the levels of total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 were increased, the rank order being IgG1 > IgG2 > IgG3 = IgG4. Following treatment, a significant decrease in total IgG and the four subclasses occurred in the SAG-responsive group, whereas in the SAG-unresponsive group these levels were unchanged or slightly increased. Therefore, monitoring of IgG1 and IgG2 levels in Indian kala-azar patients is a good serologic alternative to monitoring the disease status.
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can adversely affect the kidney. They may induce sodium retention and antagonize the action of diuretics, impair free-water clearance and cause hyponatremia, and prevent aldosterone production and cause hyperkalemic hyperchloremic acidosis. If patients taking these drugs are exposed to a renal insult, acute renal failure becomes more likely. Similarly, patients with chronic renal disease who are taking them appear to be at greater risk of chronic renal failure. However, not all renal effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are adverse. Beneficial effects have been reported in patients with Bartter's syndrome and in those with severe orthostatic hypotension.
Opiate or NMDA receptor antagonists given during and/or after the development of tolerance and dependence have been reported to prevent these developments. In the present study, MK801 (dizolcipine) and naltrexone (NX), two antagonists of NMDA and opiate receptors, respectively were used in rats to find any correlations between changes in NMDA receptor kinetics, and the intensity of tolerance and dependence. Thus, six different groups of rats were formed. The rats in the groups were given saline (S)+S, S+morphine (M), NX+S, NX+M, MK801+S and MK801+M, respectively, once per day for 8 days. On day 9, the rats from each group were divided into four subgroups. The rats of the first subgroup were subjected to the determination of tail-flick latency. The rats of the second subgroup were administered 1 mg kg-1 naloxone (NL) 2 h after administration of 3 mg kg-1M. The rats of the third subgroup were implanted with two M pellets and after 72 h they were challenged with NL. The remaining rats received drugs also on day 9 according to the previous administration paradigm. Two hours after the administrations, their brains were utilised for the determination of NMDA receptor kinetics, employing [3H]glutamate. The measurement of tail-flick latency showed the prevention by NX or MK801 of the development of tolerance to M. The rats, which were administered 3 mg kg-1M 2 h before 1 mg kg-1 NL injection, on day 9 showed that only NX given previously along with M attenuated the intensity of the development of M dependence. NX administered alone intensified the development of dependence on a single dose of M. The development of M dependence upon the M pellet implantation was intensified by the previous administration of NX or MK801 concomitantly with M. The administration of M or MK801 alone, or NX together with M, caused significant upregulation of NMDA receptors. NX alone, and MK801 given concurrently with M led to a significant downregulation. So, in light of the previous findings and the present experimental data it can be said that: (1) supersensitivity to opioids may be a downregulation of NMDA as well as an upregulation of the opioid receptor; (2) either upregulation or downregulation of NMDA receptors may facilitate subsequent development of opioid dependence; (3) tolerance to opioid may necessitate both upregulation of NMDA receptors and downregulation of opioid receptors; and (4) beneficial effects of opioid antagonists in the treatment of opiate dependence and CNS injuries may be strongly related to the down regulation of NMDA receptors.
To investigate relationships between use of vitamin supplements and the three principal cataract types in a population-based sample.
We studied 2873 of the 3654 participants (79%) aged 49 to 97 years attending the cross-sectional Blue Mountains Eye Study who completed a detailed food frequency questionnaire, which included type, dose, and duration of vitamin supplement use. Masked grading of nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular opacities from lens photographs was performed, using the Wisconsin method.
Use of multivitamin supplements was associated with reduced prevalence of nuclear cataract, odds ratio 0.6, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 1.0, P =.05. For both nuclear and cortical cataract, longer duration of multivitamin use was associated with reduced cataract prevalence (nuclear cataract, trend P =.02; cortical cataract, trend P =.03). Use of thiamin supplements was associated with reduced prevalence of nuclear (odds ratio 0.6, confidence interval 0.4 to 1.0, P =.03, dose trend P =.03) and cortical cataract (odds ratio 0.7, confidence interval 0.5 to 0.9, P =.01, dose trend P =.02). Riboflavin (odds ratio 0.8, confidence interval 0.6 to 1.0, P =.05) and niacin (odds ratio 0.7, confidence interval 0.6 to 1.0, P =.04) supplements exerted a weaker protective influence on cortical cataract. Vitamin A supplements were protective against nuclear cataract (odds ratio 0.4, confidence interval 0.2 to 0.8, P =.01, dose trend P =.01). Folate (odds ratio 0.4, confidence interval 0.2 to 0.9, P =.03) appeared protective for nuclear cataract, whereas both folate (odds ratio 0.6, confidence interval 0.3 to 0.9, P =.01, dose trend P =.04) and vitamin B12 supplements (odds ratio 0.7, confidence interval 0.5 to 1.0, P =.03, dose trend P =.02) were strongly protective against cortical cataract.
Long-term use of multivitamins, B group and vitamin A supplements was associated with reduced prevalence of either nuclear or cortical cataract. A strong protective influence on cortical cataract, from use of folate or vitamin B12 supplements, is a new finding.
Autologous stem cell transplantation after high-dose melphalan for the treatment with multiple myeloma has resulted in prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival in patients under 65 years. We have examined the role of autologous transplantation in 17 patients with multiple myeloma over 65 years at our centre using a matched pair analysis with younger patients. The median age of this cohort of patients over 65 years was 67 years (65-74) and their outcome and transplant-related morbidity was compared with 17 younger pair mates with a median age of 55 years (31-64). Sixteen patients received high-dose melphalan, and one received busulphan with autologous stem cell rescue. The high-dose therapy was well tolerated in both elderly patients and the matched pairs, with comparable time to recover neutrophils and platelets. Treatment-related mortality also did not differ significantly in both the groups. Median overall survival of the elderly patients was 3.59 years similar to 3.01 years of the pair mates (P = 0.92). Autologous stem cell transplantation after high-dose melphalan conditioning was equally well tolerated in groups of patients above and below 65 years. There was no difference in relapse rate, OS and myelotoxicity in both the groups. These findings suggest that advanced age should not be an exclusion criterion from autologous transplant programmes.
