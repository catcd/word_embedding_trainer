Chromosomal translocations and single point mutations involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene have been described in several human tumors, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) and neuroblastoma. Cancer cells are "addicted" to ALK constitutive activation and are highly sensitive to the treatment with small-molecule inhibitors. Crizotinib, an oral ALK inhibitor, has proved to provide dramatic clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC harboring ALK rearrangements. Nonetheless, acquired drug resistance inevitably develops and leads to tumor progression and relapse. Different mechanisms of crizotinib acquired drug resistance, resembling those reported for other tyrosine kinase targeted therapies, have been recently reported both in cell lines and in patients. Thus, the identification of the molecular mechanisms of crizotinib resistance will be strictly required in order to pursue the appropriate therapeutic options for patients with ALK-rearranged tumors.
This study evaluated possible effects of radiofrequency (RF) radiation on tumorigenesis induced by the mutagen 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX) given in drinking water. Female Wistar rats aged 7 weeks at the beginning of the experiments were randomly divided into four groups of 72 animals: a cage-control group and three MX-exposed groups (a daily average dose of 1.7 mg MX/kg body weight for 104 weeks), of which two were exposed to 900 MHz pulsed RF radiation and the third served as a sham-RF-radiation group. The RF-radiation groups were exposed 2 h per day, 5 days per week for 104 weeks at nominal whole-body average SARs of 0.3 W/kg and 0.9 W/kg. Complete histopathology was performed on the rats of the three MX-exposed groups. The tumor types and incidences observed in the MX-exposed animals were similar to those reported earlier in MX-exposed female Wistar rats. RF radiation did not statistically significantly affect mortality or organ-specific incidence of any tumor type. The only statistically significant difference was an increase in the combined frequency of vascular tumors of the mesenteric lymph nodes in the high-RF-radiation group compared to the sham-RF-radiation group. However, additional histopathological analysis of the cage-control animals suggested that this difference was due to unusually low frequency of this type of tumor in the sham-RF-radiation group rather than a high frequency in the high-RF-radiation group. With respect to non-neoplastic findings, statistically significant differences between the RF-radiation groups and the sham-RF-radiation group were observed only for single findings in the lacrimal glands, lungs, liver and skin. Such changes are commonly seen in aged rats and were considered to be unrelated to RF radiation. The results of the present study do not support co-carcinogenic effects of low-level long-term RF-radiation exposure in rats.
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose leads to severe hepatotoxicity, increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) protects against APAP toxicity at a mmol/kg equivalent dose to N-acetylcysteine (NAC). SAMe acts as a principle biological methyl donor and participates in polyamine synthesis which increase cell growth and has a role in mitochondrial protection. The purpose of the current study tested the hypothesis that SAMe protects against APAP toxicity by maintaining critical antioxidant enzymes and markers of oxidative stress. Male C57Bl/6 mice were treated with vehicle (Veh; water 15 ml/kg, ip), SAMe (1.25 mmol/kg, ip), APAP (250 mg/kg, ip), and SAMe+APAP (SAMe given 1 h following APAP). Liver was collected 2 and 4 h following APAP administration; mitochondrial swelling as well as hepatic catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase, and both Mn- and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity were evaluated. Mitochondrial protein carbonyl, 3-nitrotyrosine cytochrome c leakage were analyzed by Western blot. SAMe significantly increased SOD, GPx, and glutathione reductase activity at 4 h following APAP overdose. SAMe greatly reduced markers of oxidative stress and cytochrome C leakage following APAP overdose. Our studies also demonstrate that a 1.25 mmol/kg dose of SAMe does not inhibit CYP 2E1 enzyme activity. The current study identifies a plausible mechanism for the decreased oxidative stress observed when SAMe is given following APAP.
Review of toxicology screening results in our level 1 trauma center revealed that approximately 15% of urine drug screens were positive for cocaine metabolite. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of true acute cocaine intoxication and if measurement of serum would improve upon the accuracy of toxicology screening for identifying acute cases of cocaine poisoning. Cases were analyzed for cocaine metabolite (benzoylecgonine, BE) in matched serum and urine specimens and for acute cocaine intoxication by retrospective chart review. BE was identified in 3.8% of serum and 14.6% of urine specimens. For the identification of the acutely poisoned patient, the predictive value of toxicology screening was 53.4% for serum and 17.8% for urine. Of patients who screen positive for BE in serum, the odds of intoxication are 44:1 (95% CI 4.85-396.7). We conclude that subjects who test positive for BE in serum have a high probability of acute cocaine intoxication and that analyzing serum improves the predictive value of testing by 3-fold.
We studied the effects of cilostazol, an antiplatelet and vasodilating agent, on axonal transport patterns of cytoskeletal proteins in the motor fibers of sciatic nerve of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Proteins labeled with L-[35S]methionine in 6-mm consecutive segments of the nerve were analyzed electrophoretically following fractionation into Triton-soluble and-insoluble subpopulations. Transport rates of proteins (particularly neurofilaments) in slow component a were reduced by 50% 2 weeks after labeling (4 weeks after streptozotocin). An apparent reduction of tubulin and actin was observed at later intervals after induction of diabetes. Actin transported in slow component b was also impaired, though to a lesser extent than in component a. Cilostazol prevented transport impairment of both slow components a and b without affecting hyperglycemia or reduction in body weight gain. These results suggest that in sciatic motor fibers early defects in slowly transported proteins are more marked in slow component a, and that impairment may be caused primarily by hemodynamic abnormalities.
Nephrotoxicity is a frequent complication of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, in which T cells are known to promote acute kidney injury. In this study, we examined the role of T cell immunoglobulin mucin 1 (Tim-1) in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury using an inhibitory anti-Tim-1 antibody. Tim-1 acts to modulate T cell responses, but it is also expressed by damaged proximal tubules in the kidney, where it is known as kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1). Anti-Tim-1 antibodies attenuated cisplatin nephrotocity, with less histologic damage, improved renal function, and fewer leukocytes infiltrating the kidney compared with control antibody-treated mice. Renal NF-ÎºB activation and apoptosis were reduced, and proinflammatory renal cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression was decreased. Renal Kim-1 expression was reduced, consistent with the diminished kidney injury after anti-Tim-1 antibody treatment. Furthermore, anti-Tim-1 antibodies reduced early systemic CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation, apoptosis, and cytokine production. To determine whether the protective actions of anti-Tim-1 antibodies were due to effects on renal tubular cells, cisplatin nephrotoxicity was studied in Rag1(-/-) mice. Anti-Tim-1 antibodies did not affect renal dysfunction or histologic damage in Rag1(-/-) mice, showing that the benefits of inhibiting Tim-1 come from T cell effects. As Tim-1 plays an important role in promoting cisplatin nephrotoxicity, inhibiting Tim-1 may be a therapeutic strategy to prevent cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.
A patient who developed phlebitis from the intravenous administration of diazepam is described. This episode resolved in two days after treatment with moist heat packs. Three days after complete resolution, the phlebitis recurred approximately eight hours after a single oral dose of diazepam. This recurrence of phlebitis resolved slowly over seven days, with warm soaking and aspirin therapy. Oral diazepam may have exacerbated the initial phlebitis by interfering with a subclinical healing process.
RP 59500 is a new injectable streptogramin composed of two synergistic components (quinupristin and dalfopristin) which are active against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. The present experiments compared the therapeutic efficacy of RP 59500 with that of vancomycin against experimental endocarditis due to either of two erythromycin-susceptible or two constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. RP 59500 had low MICs for the four test organisms as well as for 24 additional isolates (the MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited was < 1 mg/liter) which were mostly inducibly (47%) or constitutively (39%) erythromycin resistant. Aortic endocarditis in rats was produced with catheter-induced vegetations. Three-day therapy was initiated 12 h after infection, and the drugs were delivered via a computerized pump, which permitted the mimicking of the drug kinetics produced in human serum by twice-daily intravenous injections of 7 mg of RP 59500 per kg of body weight or 1 g of vancomycin. Both antibiotics reduced vegetation bacterial titers to below detection levels in ca. 70% of animals infected with the erythromycin-susceptible isolates (P < 0.05 compared with titers in controls). Vancomycin was also effective against the constitutively resistant strains, but RP 59500 failed against these isolates. Further experiments proved that RP 59500 failures were related to the very short life span of dalfopristin in serum (< or = 2 h, compared with > or = 6 h for quinupristin), since successful treatment was restored by artificially prolonging the dalfopristin levels for 6 h. Thus, RP 59500 is a promising alternative to vancomycin against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections, provided that pharmacokinetic parameters are adjusted to afford prolonged levels of both of its constituents in serum. This observation is also relevant to humans, in whom the life span of dalfopristin in serum is also shorter than that of quinupristin.
Mexiletine may protect patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) type 3 from arrhythmias. However, we found an unusual in utero presentation of intermittent atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia (spontaneous or lidocaine-induced) in a fetus and his sibling with LQTS.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying channelopathy and functional alteration.
Mutations were searched in KCNQ1, HERG, KCNE1, KCNE2, and SCN5A genes. In expressed mutants, whole-cell voltage clamp defined the electrophysiologic properties.
Novel missense mutations involving hERG (F627L) at the pore region and SCN5A (R43Q) at the N-terminus were found in the proband and in family members with prolonged QT interval. In oocytes injected with mRNA encoding hERG/ F627L, almost zero K(+) currents were elicited. In coinjected oocytes, the currents were decreased to half. In tsA201 cells transfected with SCN5A/R43Q, although the baseline kinetics of the Na current were similar to wild type, lidocaine caused a unique hyperpolarizing shift of the activation and increased the availability of Na currents at resting voltages. Window currents were enhanced due to a right shift of steady-state inactivation. These electrophysiologic alterations after lidocaine may lead to the development of ventricular tachycardia.
We identified a novel hERG/F627L mutation that results in LQTS with fetal onset of atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia. A coexisting SCN5A/R43Q variant, although it per se does not prolong repolarization, contributes to the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias after lidocaine. Patients with such latent lidocaine-induced phenotype who are given lidocaine or mexiletine may be at risk.
The effects of calcium gluconate pretreatment on succinylcholine-induced postoperative muscle pain and on the changes in serum potassium and calcium levels were studied in 80 patients undergoing elective surgery who were to become ambulatory on the same evening. A test group of 40 patients was given 10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia with thiopental followed by succinylcholine for tracheal intubation. A control group of 40 patients was given thiopental and succinylcholine without calcium gluconate. Muscle pains were graded according to severity as nil, mild, moderate, and severe. The incidence of postoperative muscle pains was significantly less (5%) in the test group than in the control group (45%). In control patients who subsequently developed muscle pain, serum levels of potassium were significantly increased above preinduction levels 2 min after succinylcholine was administered and serum calcium levels were significantly decreased. In control patients who did not develop postoperative myalgia, there were no significant changes in serum levels of either calcium or potassium. This was also true for patients pretreated with calcium gluconate. Therefore, calcium gluconate pretreatment reduces both the increase in serum potassium and the decrease in serum calcium associated with succinylcholine, and decreases the incidence and severity of postoperative myalgia.
Recent literature suggests that the risk of prolonged neuromuscular blockade associated with atracurium compared with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents may be minimal. Two patients experienced prolonged weakness associated with the administration of atracurium. Both received atracurium 0.5-0.7 mg/kg/hour in combination with methylprednisolone 500-600 mg/day. Electromyographic results and creatine kinase levels were suggestive of muscular weakness in both patients. Despite high-dose corticosteroid therapy, the electromyographic evidence supporting prolonged weakness did not suggest typical corticosteroid myopathy. Although some clinicians advocate routine administration of atracurium in critically ill patients due to the relative lack of reports of prolonged weakness, this may be premature. Although there are fewer reports of atracurium-associated prolonged weakness compared with pancuronium and vecuronium, the patients we describe suggest that it may occur.
Two patients, one man aged 65 and one woman aged 48, presenting generalized lichen nitidus are reported. The clinical and histopathologic features of this uncommon presentation of lichen nitidus are illustrated as well as the excellent clinical response to the treatment with an H1-blocking antihistaminic (astemizol).
Usher syndrome type II is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by moderate to severe hearing impairment and progressive visual loss due to retinitis pigmentosa (RP). We carried out a mutation screening of the USH2A gene in 88 probands with Usher syndrome type II to determine the frequency of USH2A mutations as a cause for USH2. Six mutations, including 2299delG, 921-922insCAGC, R334W, N346H, R626X, and N357T were identified, with 2299delG mutation being the most frequent (16.5% of alleles), accounting for 77.5% of the pathologic alleles. Thirty-five percent (31/88) of the probands had a USH2A mutation. Nine of them carried two pathogenic mutations: six cases were homozygotes and three were compound heterozygotes. Twenty-two probands (25%) were found to carry only single USH2A mutations. One new missense mutation (N357T) occuring within the laminin N-terminal (type VI) domain of usherin was identified. Eight polymorphisms were found, five of which are novel. Our data support the view that the 2299delG is the most common mutation in USH2A.
Our recent study demonstrated that ginsenosides had antinociceptive effects by reducing some types of pain-related behavior in mice (Yoon et al., 1998. Ginsenosides induce differential antinociception and inhibit substance P-induced nociceptive response in mice. Life Science 62, PL319-PL325). In the present study we further investigated whether ginsenosides produce antinociceptive effects through an action at central or peripheral site(s) and whether these effects are mediated by the opioid system. Intraperitoneally injected ginsenosides suppressed in a dose-dependent manner the pain-related behavior produced by capsaicin injection into the plantar surface of the hind paw; the ED(50) was 49 mg/kg [26-92 mg/kg, 95% confidence interval (C.I.)]. Intrathecally or intracerebroventricularly administered ginsenosides also suppressed the capsaicin-induced pain-related behavior in a dose-dependent manner; the ED(50)s were 1.72 mg/kg (0.8-3.72 mg/kg, 95% C.I.) and 1. 48 mg/kg (0.8-2.6 mg/kg, 95% C.I.), respectively. On the other hand, subcutaneously injected ginsenosides to the plantar surface prior to the capsaicin injection did not alter the pain-related behavior. Naloxone pretreatment was without effect in blocking the antinociceptive effect of intrathecally administered ginsenosides. Intraperitoneally injected ginsenosides also did not significantly affect the motor response of animals. These results suggest that ginsenosides produce antinociceptive effects through their action at the spinal and/or supraspinal site(s), not at nociceptors in the periphery. In addition, the results suggest that the antinociceptive effects are not mediated by opioid receptors.
The chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) and the anti-angiogenic agent thalidomide (THD) have both demonstrated anti-tumor activity in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Combination treatment with TMZ and THD in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) appears to be more effective than treatment with either drug alone. To investigate the mechanism of this anti-tumor effect, we examined the combined effects of TMZ and THD in a rat glioma xenograft model. We found that combination treatment markedly inhibited the growth of tumors that were orthotopically implanted into rat brains. Using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining, we observed a significant decrease in cell proliferation in these tumors. CD31 staining of the microvasculature revealed a significant decrease in angiogenesis. We also found increased apoptosis in treated tumors by terminal deoxynucleotidyl-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. We further demonstrated that the expression of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF), were inhibited by THD. THD also decreased the number of ED1-positive, activated macrophages or microglial cells, which produce pro-angiogenic molecules around the glioma. Taken together, these results suggest that combination treatment with TMZ and THD inhibits tumor growth via the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of angiogenesis in a rat model and may be a promising therapy for malignant gliomas.
The use of class 1A antidysrhythmic agents in patients with or without prolonged QT intervals carries a risk of induction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The class 1B antidysrhythmics have many similarities to the former group, but have different modes of action and electrophysiologic properties. Therefore, lidocaine and lidocaine-like drugs such as mexiletine may be used with relative safety in this clinical situation, as in the case we have reported, in which lidocaine and mexiletine controlled VPB in the acute stage and during long-term follow-up respectively, while quinidine induced "torsades de pointes."
This study was supported by grants of New Ideas Capability for Backbone Teachers in Universities of Heilongjiang and of Scientific Research foundation in Qiqihar Medical College.
Ulcer recurrence and poor healing may be critically important to the development of serious gastrointestinal complications in patients with long-term non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The present study is to investigate the effects of aspirin on ulcer recurrence and healing quality and to explore the mechanism.
Gastric ulcers were induced with acetic acid in rats; aspirin was administrated by gavage from day 25 to day 54 after ulcer induction. The gastric juice volume, pH, gastric mucus, gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) were measured. The mRNA transcription of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were analyzed with RT-PCR and protein expression with Western blot.
The gastric juice volume was significantly increased in aspirin group compared with those of fasting or saline control groups (P<0.01); while the pH, mucus, GMBF and PGE(2) were significantly decreased in aspirin treated rats compared with those of other two groups (P<0.01). COX-2, evaluated with mRNA and protein expression, was significantly augmented in aspirin group compared with others. The quality of ulcer healing (QOUH) in Aspirin group was poorer than that of fasting or saline control groups.
Aspirin enhance the recurrence of gastric ulcer. The inhibition of cycloxygenase, mucus secretion and mucosal blood flow may be involved. Aspirin also impair the quality of ulcer healing.
Clinical practitioners have often observed in the course of their daily work that the pain thresholds of epileptic patients seem to differ from those of healthy subjects. These patients can suffer from quite severe traumatic lesions without apparently experiencing any pain. Previous studies have shown that the absence of pain is due to treatment, since most antiepileptic drugs also have analgesic effects. In the present study, it was proposed to assess the pain thresholds of 15 epileptic patients (with tonic-clonic seizures generalized at outset) treated with valproate, by measuring the leg flexion nociceptive reflex (or RIII reflex) threshold: the stimulation threshold at which this reflex is triggered is known to be correlated with the pain threshold. The results were compared with 15 control subjects. The nociceptive threshold of the patients with valproate treatment was significantly higher than that of the control population. The nociceptive threshold was also in good correlation with the valproate plasma level. These data are discussed from the point of view of the gaba-ergic system and mechanisms possibly involved.
We report on a 33-year-old woman with carcinomatous meningitis due to carcinoma of the breast who developed multiple cerebral infarctions within four days after intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate. MR angiography revealed a narrowing of basal cerebral arteries, which is consistent with vasculopathy. The vasculopathy was probably due to carcinomatous meningitis itself, an acute toxic effect of methotrexate, or a combination of both.
To determine whether the commonly used over-the-counter medications dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine are superior to placebo for the treatment of nocturnal cough and sleep difficulty associated with upper respiratory infections and to determine whether parents have improved sleep quality when their children receive the medications when compared with placebo.
Parents of 100 children with upper respiratory infections were questioned to assess the frequency, severity, and bothersome nature of the nocturnal cough. Their answers were recorded on 2 consecutive days, initially on the day of presentation, when no medication had been given the previous evening, and then again on the subsequent day, when either medication or placebo was given before bedtime. Sleep quality for both the child and the parent were also assessed for both nights.
For the entire cohort, all outcomes were significantly improved on the second night of the study when either medication or placebo was given. However, neither diphenhydramine nor dextromethorphan produced a superior benefit when compared with placebo for any of the outcomes studied. Insomnia was reported more frequently in those who were given dextromethorphan, and drowsiness was reported more commonly in those who were given diphenhydramine.
Diphenhydramine and dextromethorphan are not superior to placebo in providing nocturnal symptom relief for children with cough and sleep difficulty as a result of an upper respiratory infection. Furthermore, the medications given to children do not result in improved quality of sleep for their parents when compared with placebo. Each clinician should consider these findings, the potential for adverse effects, and the individual and cumulative costs of the drugs before recommending them to families.
In hypertensive patients, the development of left ventricular hypertrophy seems to increase the risk of cardiovascular death although some antihypertensive agents have been associated with regression in left ventricular hypertrophy. A few studies have evaluated the carvedilol, a new drug having a balanced pharmacology of vasodilatation and beta-receptor blockade, particularly in elderly hypertensive patients. To test its effects on left ventricular hypertrophy, patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were studied before and at the end of 6 months of therapy with 25 mg of carvedilol daily. Candidates had to have moderate, uncontrolled essential hypertension with echocardiographically documented left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass index > 130 g/m2 for men and > 110 g/m2 for women). Of 26 patients selected, 4 dropped out. The remaining 22 patients successfully completed 6 months of therapy. The average age was 69 +/- 8 years. Carvedilol caused a significant reduction of mean systolic blood pressure from 175 to 145 mmHg (p < 0.001), of diastolic blood pressure from 102 to 82 mmHg (p < 0.001), of left ventricular mass index from 148 +/- 24 g/m2 (p < 0.003), and a non significant change of the mean heart rate from 78 to 72 beats/min. In our study, carvedilol was well tolerated in patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.
To test the hypothesis that continuous intrarenal norepinephrine (NE) infusions produce hypertension via activation of afferent renal nerves (ARN), rats were subjected to complete renal denervation (RN-x), selective renal deafferentation (ARN-x) or sham surgery, prior to infusion of NE. In the pre-infusion period, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significantly lower in RN-x than in ARN-x or sham-operated rats. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) was significantly reduced following ARN-x, but not RN-x. During 5-day intrarenal infusions of 4, 12 or 36 micrograms NE/kg per h, MAP rose to similar levels in RN-x and sham-RN-x rats. However, RN-x rats exhibited significantly elevated PRC levels, suggesting that denervation supersensitivity masked the possible effects of RN-x. In sham-RN-x rats, MAP increased significantly more during intrarenal infusion of 12 micrograms NE/kg per h than during intravenous infusion of the same amount. In ARN-x rats, MAP rose to a similar degree during intravenous and intrarenal infusions. The pressor responses in the ARN-x rats, however, were not significantly smaller at any point than those in intact rats. PRC rose to comparable levels in ARN-x and intact rats. Thus, in normotensive rats, efferent renal nerves (ERN) but not ARN are of functional significance in maintaining basal blood pressure. ARN may be involved in the control of renin release. Since neither RN-x nor ARN-x attenuated the development of hypertension, renal nerves are not necessary for the full expression of hypertension in this model.
The effects of potassium malate and sodium succinate on the antiarrhythmic activity of novocainamide and acetylnovocainamide during modelling of chlor-calcium-induced arrhythmia as well as in disorders of cardiac rhythm during modelling of pituitrin-isadrine-induced myocardial infarction were studied. The metabolic agents were found to increase the effectiveness of acetylnovocainamide and the toxicity of novocainamide. To interpret the specific features of the mechanism of the anti-arrhythmic action of the compounds there was studied their ability to form complexes with components of biomembranes and ions of biometals.
Appropriate conditions for the indirect measurement of blood pressure in rat were determined. The value of 0.78 was found as a correlation factor between the direct and the indirect measurement methods. The direct and indirect methods were compared on hypertensive phenylephrine effects. Good dose-effect correlation of hydralazine by the indirect measurement was found. Our results indicate that the indirect measurement is suitable for the determination of hyper- and hypotensive drugs.
Beta-adrenergic blockade is of proven value in chronic heart failure. It is uncertain, however, if beta-blockade provides a similar degree of clinical benefit for heart failure patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) as those in sinus rhythm (SR).
To compare the effectiveness of beta blockade in patients with heart failure and AF.
Patients with chronic heart failure were randomized to treatment (double blind) with metoprolol 50 mg twice daily or carvedilol 25 mg twice daily in addition to standard therapy. Response was assessed after 12 weeks by a quality of life questionnaire, New York Heart Association class, exercise capacity (6-min walk test), radionucleotide ventriculography for LVEF, 2-D echocardiography measurement of left ventricular (LV) dimensions and diastolic filling and 24-h electrocardiograph monitoring to assess heart rate changes.
Both beta-blockers produced significant improvements in LVEF in both the SR group: (+6+/-10% at 12-week, P<0.001) and the AF group: (+11+/-9% at 12-week, P<0.05). However, significant improvement in symptoms (P<0.001) and exercise capacity (P<0.001) were observed only in the SR group but not in the AF group despite a significant improvement in LVEF.
Beta-blockers were effective in improving LV ejection fraction in chronic heart failure patients in either SR or AF but had less effect on symptoms and exercise capacity in those with AF.
