Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency. The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine. After a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity (day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets (12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days. Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access. Beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow. Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine, or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection). These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine, possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system.
Vitamin A deficiency makes children vulnerable to infections and influences the outcome of various infections. In 1993 vitamin A deficiency was found to be a public health problem in Bungoma district of western Kenya.
To determine the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, anaemia and malaria parasitaemia and to correlate these with haemoglobin, ferritin and acute phase response.
A cross-sectional study.
Bungoma district of western Kenya.
Three hundred and three children aged one to three years were studied.
Serum retinol, haemoglobin, serum ferritin, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein and malaria parasite density.
Twentynine percent of the children had severe vitamin A deficiency, 92% had anaemia (haemoglobin less than 10 g/dl) 24(7%) of these were severely anaemic while 76% had malaria parasitaemia. There was no significant difference in the retinol levels of children with malaria parasitaemia and those without malaria parasitaemia (P = 0.6). Retinol levels were significantly lower among children with high C-reactive protein (P < 0.001). Malaria parasitaemia negatively correlated with haemoglobin (r = -0.13, P < 0.05) and C-reactive protein (r = 0.21, P < 0.01). There was no difference in haemoglobin level of children with normal serum retinol and those with low serum retinol (P = 0.16). Ferritin did not differ significantly among children with normal haemoglobin and those with low haemoglobin (P = 0.13).
Vitamin A deficiency and anaemia are a public health problem among the children studied. The high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency may have resulted from acute phase response induced by infections.
(1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of rat urine in combination with pattern recognition analysis was evaluated for early noninvasive detection of toxicity of investigational chemical entities. Bromobenzene (B) and paracetamol (P) were administered at five single oral dosages between 2 and 500 mg/kg and between 6 and 1800 mg/kg, respectively. The sensitivity of the proposed method to detect changes in the NMR spectra 24 and 48 h after single dosing was compared with histopathology and biochemical parameters in plasma and urine. Both B and P applied at the highest dosages induced liver necrosis and markedly increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) plasma levels. At dosages of 125 mg/kg B and 450 mg/kg P, liver necrosis and changes in AST and ALT were less pronounced, while at lower dose levels these effects could not be detected. Changes in kidney pathology or standard urine biochemistry were not observed at any of these dosages. Evaluation of the total NMR dataset showed 80 signals to be sensitive for B and P dosing. Principal component analysis on the reduced dataset revealed that NMR spectra were significantly different at dosages above 8 mg/kg (B) and 110 mg/kg (P) at both sampling times. This implies a 4- to 16-fold increased sensitivity of NMR versus histopathology and clinical chemistry in recognizing early events of liver toxicity.
A procedure of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) urinalysis using pattern recognition is proposed for early detection of toxicity of investigational compounds in rats. The method is applied to detect toxicity upon administration of 13 toxic reference compounds and one nontoxic control compound (mianserine) in rats. The toxic compounds are expected to induce necrosis (bromobenzene, paracetamol, carbon tetrachloride, iproniazid, isoniazid, thioacetamide), cholestasis (alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT), chlorpromazine, ethinylestradiol, methyltestosterone, ibuprofen), or steatosis (phenobarbital, tetracycline). Animals were treated daily for 2 or 4 days except for paracetamol and bromobenzene (1 and 2 days) and carbon tetrachloride (1 day only). Urine was collected 24 h after the first and second treatment. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last treatment, and NMR data were compared with liver histopathology as well as blood and urine biochemistry. Pathology and biochemistry showed marked toxicity in the liver at high doses of bromobenzene, paracetamol, carbon tetrachloride, ANIT, and ibuprofen. Thioacetamide and chlorpromazine showed less extensive changes, while the influences of iproniazid, isoniazid, phenobarbital, ethinylestradiol, and tetracycline on the toxic parameters were marginal or for methyltestosterone and mianserine negligible. NMR spectroscopy revealed significant changes upon dosing in 88 NMR biomarker signals preselected with the Procrustus Rotation method on principal component discriminant analysis (PCDA) plots. Further evaluation of the specific changes led to the identification of biomarker patterns for the specific types of liver toxicity. Comparison of our rat NMR PCDA data with histopathological changes reported in humans and/or rats suggests that rat NMR urinalysis can be used to predict hepatotoxicity.
Treatment with clozapine may be associated with the appearance of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in up to 10% of schizophrenic patients. We present the first report of the emergence of de novo OC symptoms during clozapine withdrawal in two schizophrenic patients, associated in one with Tourette's syndrome-like tics. Resumption of clozapine led to the complete disappearance of the OC symptoms and a substantial alleviation of the tics. It is suggested that an imbalance between the dopamine and serotonin systems may account for this complication.
It is known that styrene is ototoxic and causes cochlear damage starting from the middle turn. However, the cellular mechanism underlying styrene ototoxicity is still unclear. In this study, rats were exposed to styrene by gavage at different doses once a day for varying periods. Styrene levels in the cochlear tissues, styrene-induced permanent hearing loss, cochlear disruptions, and cell death pathways were determined. Styrene concentration in the cochlea varied along with the basilar membrane with the lowest level in the basal turn being consistent with the lowest styrene-induced threshold shift and hair cell loss in this region. After 3 weeks of exposure (5 days per week), a dose-dependent permanent hearing loss and a hair cell loss, especially in the midfrequency region, were observed. The styrene exposure at a dose of 200 mg/kg, which induced a blood level of 6.0 +/- 1.0 microg/g, caused an average of 4.4 +/- 0.5% OHC (outer hair cell) loss and 2-5 dB threshold shift in the cochlear region of 20-70% from the apex. A significant OHC loss was not observed until 7 days of exposure at a dose of 800 mg/kg. Deiters cells appeared to be the most vulnerable target of styrene. When condensed nuclei were observed in Deiters cells after a few days of styrene exposure (800 mg/kg), other cells were still intact. Apoptotic cell death appeared to be the main cell death pathway in the cochlea after styrene exposure. In the styrene-induced apoptotic OHCs, histochemical staining detected activated caspases-9 and 8, indicating that both mitochondrial-dependent pathway and death receptor-dependent pathway were involved in the styrene-induced cell death.
1,4-Dichlorobenzene (DCB) induced liver cancer in male and female B6C3F(1) mice in a gavage bioassay and in male and female BDF(1) mice in an inhalation bioassay. The weight of the evidence convincingly indicates that the mouse liver tumors induced by 1,4-DCB were via a nongenotoxic-mitogenic/promotional mode of action by forcing the growth of spontaneous precancerous lesions. Doses insufficient to exhibit mitogenic or promotional activity would not be expected to increase the risk of cancer. Benchmark dose modeling of the tumor response was conduced for the combined inhalation and oral gavage bioassay data sets based on an absorbed dose basis to establish the dose or airborne concentration corresponding to 1% extra risk. Assuming that as a point of departure and dividing by an uncertainty factor of 300, yielded a value of 0.1 ppm, representing a rational estimate of an airborne concentration for the human population below which there is unlikely to be any increased risk of cancer during a lifetime. In contrast, the default model that assumes a genotoxic mode of action estimates a one in one-million increased lifetime risk of cancer at an airborne concentration of 0.00004 ppm, some 2500-fold lower than the mechanism-based model and 1,875,000-fold lower than the no observed effect concentration for induced cancer of 75 ppm in the inhalation bioassay.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st reported case of steroid-induced obstructive cardiomyopathy in a child being treated for subglottic stenosis. As well, although born at 27 weeks, our patient was over 4 kg and 4 months of age (44 weeks corrected gestational age). This appears to be a phenomenon chiefly involving premature babies in the neonatal period with no reports of this occurring in patients greater than 40 weeks corrected gestational age. Signs of cardiac hypertrophy include tachycardia, new cardiac murmur, increased oxygen requirements, decreased urine output, and decreased peripheral perfusion. Diagnosis and eventual recovery was confirmed with serial echocardiograms. Knowledge of this serious side effect of dexamethasone will allow otolaryngologists to intervene early and prevent a potentially deadly complication.
Our preliminary experience shows that flutamide is an effective treatment in patients with stage C and D prostate cancer. Local and distant response rates appear to be comparable with those obtained by "classic" hormone therapy. Libido and sexual potency are generally not affected. Palliation of symptoms is frequent and is usually accompanied by improvement of performance status and quality of life. The side effects are slight or moderate, but an elevation of transaminases in patients with borderline liver insufficiency is possible.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which include the prototypic autistic disorder (AD), Asperger's syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), are complex neurodevelopmental conditions of unknown aetiology. The current study investigated the metabolites in the methionine cycle, the transsulphuration pathway, folate, vitamin B(12) and the C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene in three groups of children diagnosed with AD (n= 15), AS (n= 5) and PDD-NOS (n= 19) and their age- and sex-matched controls (n= 25). No metabolic disturbances were seen in the AS patients, while in the AD and PDD-NOS groups, lower plasma levels of methionine (P= 0.01 and P= 0.03, respectively) and alpha-aminobutyrate were observed (P= 0.01 and P= 0.001, respectively). Only in the AD group, plasma cysteine (P= 0.02) and total blood glutathione (P= 0.02) were found to be reduced. Although there was a trend towards lower levels of serine, glycine, N, N-dimethylglycine in AD patients, the plasma levels of these metabolites as well as the levels of homocysteine and cystathionine were not statistically different in any of the ASDs groups. The serum levels of vitamin B(12) and folate were in the normal range. The results of the MTHFR gene analysis showed a normal distribution of the C677T polymorphism in children with ASDs, but the frequency of the 677T allele was slightly more prevalent in AD patients. Our study indicates a possible role for the alterations in one carbon metabolism in the pathophysiology of ASDs and provides, for the first time, preliminary evidence for metabolic and genetic differences between clinical subtypes of ASDs.
In 14 patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) due to ischemic heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, the hemodynamic response to intravenous infusion of dobutamine (D) was compared to that of a new non-catechol, non-glycoside, inotropic and vasodilator agent, MDL-17,043 (MDL) administered in incremental intravenous doses. D and MDL produced comparable increases in cardiac index (L/min/m2) (1.8 +/- 0.4 to 2.9 +/- 0.8 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 to 3.3 +/- 0.6, respectively; both p = 0.001) and stroke volume index (ml/beat/m2) (24 +/- 8 to 35 +/- 9 and 22 +/- 7 to 39 +/- 11, respectively; both p = 0.001). Both D and MDL reduced left ventricular filling pressure (29 +/- 5 to 24 +/- 5 and 29 +/- 6 to 17 +2- 6 mm Hg, respectively; both p less than 0.05), and mean right atrial pressure (11 +/- 4 to 8 +/- 4 and 13 +/- 5 to 6 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively; both p = 0.001). The overall changes in heart rate and mean arterial pressure were small with both D and MDL. However, MDL in comparison to D resulted in a significantly lower left ventricular filling pressure (p = 0.001), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p = 0.001), and mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.05). The salutary hemodynamic effects of MDL on cardiac index and left ventricular filling pressure were sustained for an average of 9.6 hours, whereas the effects of D dissipated within 30 minutes of stopping the infusion. No serious adverse effects were noted during acute administration with either drug. Therefore, intravenous MDL may be a useful substitute for D in the acute therapy of severe CHF.
Single-agent doxorubicin has been widely used to treat unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the response rate is low (< 20%) and there is no convincing evidence for improved survival. Cisplatin, interferon, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (PIAF) used in combination, by contrast, has shown promise in a phase II study. We compared doxorubicin to PIAF in patients with unresectable HCC in a phase III trial.
Patients with histologically confirmed unresectable HCC were randomly assigned to receive either doxorubicin or PIAF every 3 weeks, for up to six cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints were response rate and toxicity. Survival differences were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Treatment groups were compared for differences in the incidence of adverse events using chi-square tests. All statistical tests were two-sided.
The median survival of the doxorubicin and PIAF groups was 6.83 months (95% confidence [CI] = 4.80 to 9.56) and 8.67 months (95% CI = 6.36 to 12.00), respectively (P = 0.83). The hazard ratio for death from any cause in the PIAF compared with the doxorubicin groups was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.71 to 1.32). Eighty-six of the 94 patients receiving doxorubicin and 91 of the 94 receiving PIAF were assessable for response. The overall response rates in the doxorubicin and PIAF groups were 10.5% (95% CI = 3.9% to 16.9%) and 20.9% (95% CI = 12.5% to 29.2%), respectively. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypokalemia were statistically significantly more common in patients treated with PIAF than in patients treated with doxorubicin.
Although patients on PIAF had a higher overall response rate and better survival than patients on doxorubicin, the differences were not statistically significant. PIAF was also associated with increased treatment-related toxicity. The prognosis of patients with unresectable HCC remains poor.
Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is one of the most potent drugs in cancer chemotherapy, and is highly effective in treating both newly diagnosed and relapse patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Despite a number of reports regarding the molecular mechanisms by which ATO promotes anti-tumor or pro-apoptotic activity in hematological and other solid malignancies, the effects of ATO on immune responses remain poorly understood. To further understand and clarify the effects of ATO on immune responses, we sought to examine whether ATO affects the production of nitric oxide (NO) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Arsenic trioxide was found to prevent NO production in a dose-dependent manner. Arsenic trioxide significantly inhibited the increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that the inhibitory effect of ATO on iNOS expression was ascribed to the prevention of IRF3 phosphorylation, interferon (IFN)-β expression, and STAT1 phosphorylation, but not the prevention of the MyD88-dependent pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that ATO prevents NO production by inhibiting the TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-β (TRIF)-dependent pathway, thus highlighting an anti-inflammatory property of ATO in innate immunity.
To determine whether any abnormality in serum bone markers is related to bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw.
We obtained serum bone markers and other relevant endocrine assays on 7 patients with osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ). The assays were C-telopeptide, N-telopeptide, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, intact parathyroid hormone, T3, T4, TSH, and vitamin D 25 hydroxy. Diagnostic criteria for ONJ were those formulated by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.
Five of our patients were women. Two had metastatic breast cancer and had been treated with zoledronic acid; 1 had also received pamidronate. Three others had osteoporosis and had been treated with daily alendronate. One man had metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid. Another man had Gaucher's disease treated with zoledronic acid. All patients had been withdrawn from bisphosphonate for at least 6 months. None was taking or had taken corticosteroids. None of the lesions had shown any significant healing and all were still causing the patients considerable distress, yet the bone markers were within the normal range as measured in our laboratory, except for intact parathyroid hormone, which was slightly elevated in 1 case of metastatic breast cancer (177 pg/mL).
We hypothesize that matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) is a candidate gene for bisphosphonate-induced ONJ for 3 reasons: 1) MMP2 is associated with bone abnormalities which could be related to ONJ. 2) Bisphosphonates are associated with atrial fibrillation, and MMP2 is the only gene known to be associated with both bone abnormalities and atrial fibrillation. 3) A network of disorders and disease genes linked by known disorder-gene associations indicates that cardiovascular disease and bone disease are closely related, suggesting that a single drug such as bisphosphonate, acting on a single gene, MMP2, could have both bone and cardiovascular side effects different from the osteoclast inhibition that is characteristic of bisphosphonate.
Screening of the proteome of microdissected glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci and normal-appearing liver on anionic (Q10), and cationic (CM10) surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) ProteinChip arrays demonstrated significant overexpression of cytokeratin 8 (CK8; m/z 54,020), cytokeratin 18 (CK18; m/z 47,760), microsomal cytochrome 5A (m/z 15,224) and histone type 2 H2aa3 (m/z 15,964) in the livers of rats initiated with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) followed by 10 weeks on phenobarbital (PB) at a dose of 500 ppm. Furthermore, formation of CK8 and CK18 complexes due to CK8 phosphorylation at Ser73 and Ser431 was found to be strongly associated with promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis by PB and the development of hepatocellular carcinomas. The data were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and real-time Q-PCR and profound overexpression of CK8 and CK18 (CK8/18) proteins and mRNAs were detected in several large size GST-P positive foci and liver tumors. A strong correlation between CK8/18 positive foci development and multiplicity of hepatocellular carcinomas was further observed. Moreover, elevation of CK8/18 was strongly associated with induction of cell proliferation in GST-P positive foci and tumors. In conclusion, our data imply that CK8/18 overexpression, those two cytokeratins complex formation associated with histone type 2 H2aa3 up-regulation and intermediate filament reorganization may drive neoplastic transformation of GST-P positive foci during rat hepatocarcinogenesis leading to the formation of hepatocellular carcinomas.
Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a well-known carcinogen in rodents and concerns exist regarding its potential carcinogenicity in humans. Oxidative metabolites of TCE, such as dichloroacetic acid (DCA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA), are thought to be hepatotoxic and carcinogenic in mice. The reactive products of glutathione conjugation, such as S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC), and S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl) glutathione (DCVG), are associated with renal toxicity in rats. Recently, we developed a new analytical method for simultaneous assessment of these TCE metabolites in small-volume biological samples. Since important gaps remain in our understanding of the pharmacokinetics of TCE and its metabolites, we studied a time-course of DCA, TCA, DCVG and DCVG formation and elimination after a single oral dose of 2100 mg/kg TCE in male B6C3F1 mice. Based on systemic concentration-time data, we constructed multi-compartment models to explore the kinetic properties of the formation and disposition of TCE metabolites, as well as the source of DCA formation. We conclude that TCE-oxide is the most likely source of DCA. According to the best-fit model, bioavailability of oral TCE was approximately 74%, and the half-life and clearance of each metabolite in the mouse were as follows: DCA: 0.6 h, 0.081 ml/h; TCA: 12 h, 3.80 ml/h; DCVG: 1.4 h, 16.8 ml/h; DCVC: 1.2 h, 176 ml/h. In B6C3F1 mice, oxidative metabolites are formed in much greater quantities (approximately 3600 fold difference) than glutathione-conjugative metabolites. In addition, DCA is produced to a very limited extent relative to TCA, while most of DCVG is converted into DCVC. These pharmacokinetic studies provide insight into the kinetic properties of four key biomarkers of TCE toxicity in the mouse, representing novel information that can be used in risk assessment.
Phalloidin causes severe liver damage characterized by marked cholestasis, which is due in part to irreversible polymerization of actin filaments. Liver uptake of this toxin through the transporter OATP1B1 is inhibited by the bile acid derivative BALU-1, which does not inhibit the sodium-dependent bile acid transporter NTCP. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether BALU-1 prevents liver uptake of phalloidin without impairing endogenous bile acid handling and hence may have protective effects against the hepatotoxicity induced by this toxin. In anaesthetized rats, i.v. administration of BALU-1 increased bile flow more than taurocholic acid (TCA). Phalloidin administration decreased basal (-60%) and TCA-stimulated bile flow (-55%) without impairing bile acid output. Phalloidin-induced cholestasis was accompanied by liver necrosis, nephrotoxicity and haematuria. In BALU-1-treated animals, phalloidin-induced cholestasis was partially prevented. Moreover haematuria was not observed, which was consistent with histological evidences of BALU-1-prevented injury of liver and kidney tissue. HPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed that BALU-1 was secreted in bile mainly in non-conjugated form, although a small proportion (<5%) of tauro-BALU-1 was detected. BALU-1 did not inhibit the biliary secretion of endogenous bile acids. When highly choleretic bile acids, - ursodeoxycholic (UDCA) and dehydrocholic acid (DHCA) - were administered, they were found less efficient than BALU-1 in preventing phalloidin-induced cholestasis. Biliary phalloidin elimination was low but it was increased by BALU-1>TCA>DHCA>UDCA. In conclusion, BALU-1 is able to protect against phalloidin-induced hepatotoxicity, probably due to an inhibition of the liver uptake and an enhanced biliary secretion of this toxin.
The brain mesoaccumbens dopamine system is intricately involved in the psychomotor stimulant activities of cocaine. However, the extent to which different dopamine receptors mediate these effects has not yet been firmly established. The present study used dopamine D1 receptor mutant mice produced by gene targeting to investigate the role of this receptor in the effects induced by cocaine. In contrast with wild-type mice, which showed a dose-dependent increase in locomotion, D1 mutant mice exhibited a dose-dependent decrease. Electrophysiological studies of dopamine-sensitive nucleus accumbens neurons demonstrated a marked reduction in the inhibitory effects of cocaine on the generation of action potentials. In addition, the inhibitory effects of dopamine as well as D1 and D2 agonists were almost completely abolished, whereas those of serotonin were unaffected. D2-like dopamine receptor binding was also normal. These results demonstrate the essential role of the D1 receptor in the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine and in dopamine-mediated neurophysiological effects within the nucleus accumbens.
Patients with chronic open angle glaucoma are traditionally managed by medical therapy during the early stages of the disease. Pilocarpine is a well established topical agent, but suffers troublesome sequelae, the most apparent of which is pupillary constriction. This study assesses the effect of miosis (produced by one drop of 2% pilocarpine) on the static threshold perimetry of 20 subjects with chronic open angle glaucoma and documented visual field loss, using the 30-2 program of the Humphrey field analyser. Following miosis, the Statpac mean defect deteriorated by an average of -1.49 dB compared with baseline (p = 0.004). This dB deterioration is twice that reported in studies on younger normal subjects following miosis. The decrease in mean defect showed a positive correlation with the degree of pupillary constriction, the correlation being greater in those eyes with a miosed pupil diameter of 2 mm or less. There was no significant decrease in the other Statpac global indices following miosis. A parallel study using the fellow eye of the same glaucoma patients showed a high degree of intertest variability, but no significant learning or fatigue effect. We conclude that pilocarpine-induced miosis causes a significant deterioration in visual field in a population of patients with chronic open angle glaucoma: this factor should be considered when choosing therapy for glaucoma particularly in cases where field loss approaches the permitted legal minimum for driving.
Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient to the normal brain function. However, there is an increasing concern regarding the use of vitamin A at high doses even therapeutically. Here, we show that acute and chronic vitamin A supplementation induces oxidative stress to submitochondrial particles (SMP) isolated from rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Both chronic and acute vitamin A supplementation at therapeutic (1000 IU/kg or 2500 IU/kg) or excessive (4500 IU/kg or 9000 IU/kg) doses induced lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and oxidation of protein thiol groups in cerebral cortex and cerebellum SMP. Furthermore, vitamin A supplementation induced an increase in the superoxide (O(2)(-)) anion production, indicating an uncoupling in the electron transfer chain (ETC). Locomotory and exploratory activity, which are associated to cerebral cortex and cerebellum, also were affected by both acute and chronic vitamin A supplementation. Vitamin A induced a decrease in both locomotory and exploratory behavior. Together, these results show that vitamin A could be toxic at the sub cellular level, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and altering cerebral cortex and/or cerebellum-dependent behavior.
Cyclosporine nephrotoxicity is caused by renal arteriolar vasoconstriction and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Endothelin has been proposed as a major mediator of these phenomena. Heparin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and lowers blood pressure by regulating endogenous endothelin 1 production. In a model of chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in the rat, animals were treated with cyclosporine alone, cyclosporine plus heparin, and heparin alone for 28 days. Independent experiments determined that these doses of heparin resulted in a marked decrease in responsivity to exogenous endothelin. Despite this, there were no beneficial effects on renal structure or function in this animal model of chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Thus, the role of endothelin in the pathogenesis of the chronic tubulointerstitial changes and arteriolopathy in this model is probably minor.
The molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory action of theophylline is currently unknown, but low-dose theophylline is an effective add-on therapy to corticosteroids in controlling asthma. Corticosteroids act, at least in part, by recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the site of active inflammatory gene transcription. They thereby inhibit the acetylation of core histones that is necessary for inflammatory gene transcription. We show both in vitro and in vivo that low-dose theophylline enhances HDAC activity in epithelial cells and macrophages. This increased HDAC activity is then available for corticosteroid recruitment and predicts a cooperative interaction between corticosteroids and theophylline. This mechanism occurs at therapeutic concentrations of theophylline and is dissociated from phosphodiesterase inhibition (the mechanism of bronchodilation) or the blockade of adenosine receptors, which are partially responsible for its side effects. Thus we have shown that low-dose theophylline exerts an anti-asthma effect through increasing activation of HDAC which is subsequently recruited by corticosteroids to suppress inflammatory genes.
We report on a schizophrenic patient whose tardive dystonia, delusions, and auditory hallucinations showed remarkable concurrent improvement after replacing haloperidol with risperidone. The present finding suggests that the 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2) antagonistic action of risperidone has brought about the improvement in tardive dystonia. The 5-HT2 antagonistic action of risperidone, in addition to its dopamine antagonistic action, may have also lessened psychotic symptoms in the current case.
A model to study the dermonecrotic effects of a crude fraction of venom from the brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa) was developed using female New Zealand white rabbits. In the rabbit model, surgical excision of the sites of intradermally injected crude venom did not always prevent subsequent necrosis or wound dehiscence despite the use of fluorescein to determine the surgical margin. Heparin and steroids did not prevent the venom-induced necrosis and were much less effective than surgical excision or injecting a specific antivenom. When given within 24 hours, the specific antivenom raised against the brown recluse spider venom blocked or markedly attenuated the toxic effects of the venom in the rabbit model system.
Despite the fact that the teratogenic effects of phenytoin have been suggested in several case reports, the evidence for a possible oncogenic potential of phenytoin has not been widely recognized. Recently, neuroblastoma as well as other neuroectodermal and non-ectodermal tumors has been seen in several children exposed to phenytoin prenatally. Previous cases have been almost uniformly associated with the features of "fetal hydantoin syndrome" and none have been developmentally normal. We report a developmentally-normal boy of 21/2 years with an abdominal neuroblastoma whose mother had been on phenytoin (as well as carbamazepine) throughout gestation. We review the various neoplasms which have been reported in the offspring of mothers receiving phenytoin.
This study was designed to analyze the effects of carbocromene on circulatory and electrophysiologic failure in rats anesthetized with urethane. Amitriptyline was infused at 0.4 mg/kg/min (n = 12) until death of the animals at 30 +/- 6.7 min due to vascular collapse. Following initial heart rate increase and QRS prolongation, this was characterized by progressive hypotension, bradycardia, intraventricular conduction delay, S-T segment elevation and A-V block. In the initial 31 rats, carbocromene was administered i.v. with 4 mg/kg followed in two groups by 40 (n = 13) and 80 micrograms/kg/min (n = 18) i.v., respectively. The drug was effective in protecting the animals against the acute cardiovascular failure induced by amitriptyline. The preservation was associated with a diminution of the hypotension, negative chronotropic actions, S-T segment elevation and the incidence of A-V block produced by amitriptyline. Survival time of the rats increased to 46 +/- 5.3 min (p less than 0.05 vs. amitriptyline controls) and 63 +/- 6.5 min (p less than 0.01) with infusion of 40 and 80 micrograms/kg/min carbocromene, respectively. These results suggest that carbocromene is an effective treatment of amitriptyline-induced cardiotoxicity by massive overdose with beneficial effects largely due to hemodynamic and metabolic oxygen-sparing impact on the heart. Membrane stabilizing antiarrhythmic carbocromene effects may be contributory factors in its protective value in the treatment of acute amitriptyline poisoning.
Erectile dysfunction is a common condition in middle-aged and older men and frequently occurs in association with various chronic illnesses, particularly cardiovascular diseases. As there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity, clinicians should consider the patient's cardiovascular status before initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction. This is particularly relevant for men with decreased exercise tolerance as a result of their ischemic heart disease. We examined 2 patients with no history of cardiovascular disease suffering from myocardial ischemia after sildenafil administration. The literature about a correlation between sildenafil and coronary artery disease is reviewed.
