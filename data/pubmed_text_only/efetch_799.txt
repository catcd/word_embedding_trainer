42 obese women who lost at least 6 kg after 26 weeks on fenfluramine tablets had their treatment changed to either an equivalent dose of a sustained-release preparation of fenfluramine or matching placebo in double-blind fashion. Of the 21 given placebo all but 2 regained weight over the following year. Of the 21 crossed over to fenfluramine, 8 maintained their weight loss, 7 regained weight, and 6 had to be withdrawn for reasons other than weight gain. Plasma concentrations of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine taken before and 4 weeks after the crossover were similar in both responders and non-responders, but non-responders did not maintain their drug levels for as long as did the responders. Longer controlled administration of fenfluramine will prevent weight regain in some obese women but the hazards of prolonged use remain to be evaluated.
Formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers are widely used in consumer products and may often cause contact allergy.
To investigate the prevalence of concomitant contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers in dermatitis patients, and to determine the sources of formaldehyde exposure based on personal and occupational products obtained from dermatitis patients.
Patch test data from referred dermatitis patients with a positive patch test reaction to formaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasers were analysed. For the period 2000-2008, the formaldehyde content in products obtained from formaldehyde-allergic patients was analysed by chromotropic acid test and/or acetylacetone test.
Patients allergic to a formaldehyde-releaser often had simultaneous contact allergy to formaldehyde. Other combinations were also prevalent. In patients who reacted to more than two formaldehyde-releasers, nearly all reacted simultaneously to formaldehyde. Seventy-five percent of the formaldehyde-allergic patients used a product that contained formaldehyde. The main source of formaldehyde exposure was cosmetics (78%).
Concomitant contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releaser remains common. Furthermore, contact allergy to a formaldehyde-releaser was nearly always concomitant with another formaldehyde-releaser. Formaldehyde was commonly found in personal products used by formaldehyde-allergic patients.
In experiments on various animals glyderinine, a derivative of glycyrrhizic acid isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra, was found to exert a pronounced anti-inflammatory effect exceeding that of hydrocortisone and amidopyrine. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect was to a certain degree related to the adrenal cortex, suppression of vascular permeability and antagonism to inflammation as well. Similarly to other anti-inflammatory agents, glyderinine possesses analgesic and antipyretic properties, but unlike them it fails to suppress hemopoiesis and to cause ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosa. The drug is of low toxicity and exerts the antiallergic effect. Glyderinine was successfully tried and recommended for a wide use as an ointment for treating skin diseases.
Both obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Published data suggest that orlistat 120 mg, a lipase inhibitor used to treat obesity, may improve glycaemic parameters through weight loss-independent effects.
To investigate the effect of orlistat 120 mg on weight loss, and assess whether changes in glycaemic parameters [fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)] are independent of weight loss.
This retrospective analysis of pooled data from seven multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involved overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes (aged 18-70 years). Patients were required to have a body mass index of 27-43 kg/m2, HbA1c of 6.5 to <13%, and stable weight for > or =3 months. Subjects received orlistat 120 mg tid or placebo for 6 or 12 months.
A total of 2550 overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled and randomized to treatment with orlistat 120 mg tid (n = 1279) or placebo (n = 1271). For the whole population, patients treated with orlistat 120 mg had significantly greater mean decreases in FPG compared with placebo-treated patients (-1.39 mmol/l vs. -0.47 mmol/l; p < 0.0001). In addition, orlistat 120 mg provided significantly larger mean decreases in HbA1c compared with placebo (-0.74% vs. -0.31%; p < 0.0001). For patients with minimal weight loss (< or =1% of baseline body weight), orlistat 120 mg still provided a significantly greater decrease in the least squares mean value for both FPG (-0.83 mmol/l vs. +/-0.02 mmol/l; p = 0.0052) and HbA1c -0.29% vs. +/-0.14%; p = 0.0008). This suggested that the improvement of glycaemic control with orlistat 120 mg was independent of weight loss. Using linear regression analysis, improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c) with orlistat 120 mg was less strongly correlated with weight loss than for placebo.
Orlistat 120 mg appears to improve glycaemic control more than would be predicted by weight loss alone in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Postulated mechanisms underlying this effect include an improvement of insulin sensitivity, a slower and incomplete digestion of dietary fat, reduction of postprandial plasma non-esterified fatty acids, decreased visceral adipose tissue, and stimulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion in the lower small intestine.
Hyperlactatemia has been suggested as a prognostic marker in acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure, and a modification of the King's College Hospital criteria to incorporate arterial lactate measurements has recently been proposed. The aims of the present study were to further evaluate arterial lactate as a prognostic marker in acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and to analyze its relationship to known causes of hyperlactatemia such as multiple organ failure and inflammation.
Data were collected early after admission and again at the time of onset of grade 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy from acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure. Multiple organ failure and inflammatory response were assessed by the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and manifestation of the severe inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), respectively.
A specialized liver intensive care unit at a tertiary liver center.
One hundred and one consecutive patients with acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and grade 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy.
None.
Arterial lactate was higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors both early after admission (9.8 +/- 6.5 mmol/L vs. 5.2 +/- 4.2 mmol/L, p = .00004) and at the time of onset of hepatic encephalopathy (6.9 +/- 5.6 mmol/L vs. 3.2 +/- 2.0 mmol/L, p < .00001). At both time points, arterial lactate significantly correlated with SOFA score and the number of SIRS components fulfilled. Applying the lactate modification of the King's College Hospital criteria increased their sensitivity but reduced their specificity to <50%.
The study confirmed arterial lactate as a prognostic marker in acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure. Arterial lactate correlated with SOFA score and with the number of SIRS components fulfilled. The lactate modification of the King's College Hospital criteria showed no obvious advantages over the existing selection criteria.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), typically occurring in the second week of heparin therapy, is an antibody-mediated adverse drug reaction associated with increased thrombotic risk. The most important antigens are located on platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin complexes. HIT is always caused by platelet-activating antibodies, but not all PF4/heparin-reactive antibodies cause HIT. Thus, tests have a high negative, but only a moderate, positive predictive value. Clinical suspicion of HIT requires cessation of heparin and substitution with an alternative anticoagulant. As these drugs have an increased bleeding risk, they should be used in therapeutic doses only if HIT is considered very likely. Avoiding/postponing coumarin is crucial in minimizing microthrombotic complications. Recent studies of HIT immunobiology suggest that HIT mimics immunity against repetitive antigens, as are relevant in microbial defense. Thus, understanding HIT may help unravel why host defenses can trigger autoimmunity.
We conducted a telephone survey in Houston in March 1983 to assess the level of aspirin use among children during the influenza season. We completed interviews of 200 households with 346 children aged 12 years or younger. Fifty-two percent of the 346 children experienced at least one acute illness in the preceding three months. Fever was measured with a thermometer in 114 ill children, 103 of whom had at least one measured temperature of 37.7 degrees C or greater. Fourteen percent of these 103 children received aspirin only, 61% received acetaminophen only, and 20% received both. Among a subgroup of 44 children with temperatures of at least 39.4 degrees C, 11% received aspirin only, 59% received acetaminophen only, and 27% received both. Only 60% of the 200 parents interviewed had heard of Reye's syndrome. Forty-two percent knew of the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin use. The survey suggests that acetaminophen has replaced aspirin as the major antipyretic used by children in Houston. If the decline in aspirin use in Houston is representative of the population in the United States, and if aspirin is causally related to Reye's syndrome, the incidence of Reye's syndrome may decline.
We report a case with typical clinical features of drug-induced lupus erythematosus, together with verrucous endocarditis and pleuropericardial effusion, due to amiodarone treatment. After cessation of amiodarone treatment, the patient recovered completely.
A case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in a 23 year old male patient is reported. The symptoms were hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, change in mental status, sinus tachycardia, creatinine phosphokinase elevation and myoglobinuria. The patient suffered from severe muscle pain and compromised respiratory function. Treatment was cessation of neuroleptic medication and institution of intensive medical care focusing on symptomatic treatment. One week after admission clinical status and laboratory findings were normalized and the patient was readmitted to a psychiatric hospital. The neuroleptic medication of the reported patient had been olanzapine during seven months at a dose of 25 mg daily. The day before onset of NMS the pharmacological treatment was supplemented by 100 mg of clozapine. The cause of onset of NMS in this case is discussed. Clozapine, an atypical neuroleptic, is known to have reduced potential to cause NMS and in such cases without extrapyramidal symptoms. Olanzapine, however, has not yet been reported to cause NMS. Alternatively the cause of onset of NMS in this patient could be explained by the combination treatment and possible synergistic effect of the two antipsychotic drugs. Further research in this field is needed.
Neuropsychiatric side-effects from mefloquine are well known. When used for prophylaxis, the side-effects have been claimed to be relatively rare, mild and transient, most often arising within two to three weeks, and in patients with a previous history of neuropsychiatric disorders. We here describe a case of severe neuropsychiatric side-effects arising six weeks after initiating mefloquine prophylaxis, requiring repeated hospitalization, and not resolving completely after six months, in a previously healthy 30 year-old female.
Four chemicals that are known to induce in rats thyroid follicular-cell adenomas and carcinomas were assayed for their ability to induce DNA damage and DNA repair synthesis in primary cultures of human thyroid cells. Significant dose-dependent increases in the frequency of DNA single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites, as measures by the Comet assay, were obtained after a 20-h exposure to the following subtoxic concentrations of the four test compounds: 2,4-diaminoanisole (DAA) from 0.10 to 1.0 mM, 4,4'-methylene-bis(N,N-dimethyl)benzenamine (MDB) from 0.32 to 1.8 mM, propylthiouracil (PTU) from 1.8 to 5.6 mM, and 4,4'-thiodianiline (THA) from 0.032 to 0.18 mM. Under the same experimental conditions, DNA repair synthesis, as evaluated by quantitative autoradiography, was present in thyreocytes exposed to DAA but absent after treatment with MDB, PTU, and THA. Consistent with their thyroid-specific carcinogenic activity, all the four chemicals, administered p.o. in rats in a single dose corresponding to 1/2 LD50, induced a statistically significant degree of DNA fragmentation in the thyroid, whereas any substantial evidence of DNA lesions was absent in liver, kidney, and lung, which, with the exception of liver tumors caused by THA, are not targets of the carcinogenic activity of the four test compounds. These findings indicate that the DNA damage observed in thyroid cells was consistent with the carcinogenicity of the four test compounds, and suggest that DAA, MDB, PTU, and THA might be carcinogenic to thyroid in humans.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway is a central regulator of tumor growth, which is constitutively activated in chemically induced mouse liver tumors. In about 30-50% of cases this effect can be related to activation of the Ha-ras gene by point mutations, whereas in the remaining cases mutations may occur in other members within this pathway, such as Raf kinases. Recently, B-raf has been shown to be frequently mutated in human melanomas and certain other cancers, with a V599E amino-acid change representing the most predominant mutation type. We now screened 82 N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced liver tumors from C3H/He mice for mutations within the hotspot positions in the Ha-ras and B-raf genes. About 50% (39/82) of tumors showed Ha-ras codon 61 mutations and 16 tumors ( approximately 20%) harbored mutations at codon 624 of the B-raf gene, which corresponds to codon 599 in human B-raf. None of the tumors was mutated in both Ha-ras and B-raf. The high prevalence of Ha-ras and B-raf mutations in mouse liver tumors is in striking contrast to human hepatocellular cancers which very infrequently harbor mutations in the two genes. These fundamental differences between the biology of liver tumors in mice and man may be of toxicological relevance.
We report the generation and analysis of mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of the Dlx5 homeobox gene. Dlx5 mutant mice have multiple defects in craniofacial structures, including their ears, noses, mandibles and calvaria, and die shortly after birth. A subset (28%) exhibit exencephaly. Ectodermal expression of Dlx5 is required for the development of olfactory and otic placode-derived epithelia and surrounding capsules. The nasal capsules are hypoplastic (e.g. lacking turbinates) and, in most cases, the right side is more severely affected than the left. Dorsal otic vesicle derivatives (e. g. semicircular canals and endolymphatic duct) and the surrounding capsule, are more severely affected than ventral (cochlear) structures. Dlx5 is also required in mandibular arch ectomesenchyme, as the proximal mandibular arch skeleton is dysmorphic. Dlx5 may control craniofacial development in part through the regulation of the goosecoid homeobox gene. goosecoid expression is greatly reduced in Dlx5 mutants, and both goosecoid and Dlx5 mutants share a number of similar craniofacial malformations. Dlx5 may perform a general role in skeletal differentiation, as exemplified by hypomineralization within the calvaria. The distinct focal defects within the branchial arches of the Dlx1, Dlx2 and Dlx5 mutants, along with the nested expression of their RNAs, support a model in which these genes have both redundant and unique functions in the regulation of regional patterning of the craniofacial ectomesenchyme.
A variety of medications can induce or enhance a tremor. Tremors most commonly affect the limbs, especially the arms. We report a patient who presented with a 5-6 Hz jaw tremor with a temporal association with the administration of citalopram. To our knowledge, this is the first report in literature, of a transient jaw tremor associated with citalopram. According to the current data, citalopram-induced jaw tremor can be explained by an indirect inhibitory effect on central dopaminergic activity.
Mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of the homeobox gene Goosecoid (Gsc) have multiple craniofacial defects. To understand the mechanisms responsible for these defects, the behavior of Gsc-null cells was examined in morula aggregation chimeras. In these chimeras, Gsc-null cells were marked with beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity using the ROSA26 lacZ allele. In addition, mice with a lacZ gene that had been introduced into the Gsc locus were used as a guide to visualize the location of Gsc-expressing cells. In Gsc-null<->wild-type chimeras, tissues that would normally not express Gsc were composed of both Gsc-null and wild-type cells that were well mixed, reflecting the overall genotypic composition of the chimeras. However, craniofacial tissues that would normally express Gsc were essentially devoid of Gsc-null cells. Furthermore, the nasal capsules and mandibles of the chimeras had defects similar to Gsc-null mice that varied in severity depending upon the proportion of Gsc-null cells. These results combined with the analysis of Gsc-null mice suggest that Gsc functions cell autonomously in mesenchyme-derived tissues of the head. A developmental analysis of the tympanic ring bone, a bone that is always absent in Gsc-null mice because of defects at the cell condensation stage, showed that Gsc-null cells had the capacity to form the tympanic ring condensation in the presence of wild-type cells. However, analysis of the tympanic ring bones of 18.5 d.p.c. chimeras suggests that Gsc-null cells were not maintained. The participation of Gsc-null cells in the tympanic ring condensation of chimeras may be an epigenetic phenomenon that results in a local environment in which more precursor cells are present. Thus, the skeletal defects observed in Gsc-null mice may reflect a regional reduction of precursor cells during embryonic development.
A 45-year-old man treated for pulmonary tuberculosis with daily drug therapy, including rifampin, developed acute renal failure manifested by ebinophilia, skin rash, and increased serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. The renal failure was marked by a prolonged course and incomplete recovery. Renal biopsy showed tubulointerstitial nephritis with nonspecific glomerular mesangial proliferation. Fluorescence staining showed the presence of IgG, IgA, AgM, and C3 deposits in glomeruli, as well as IgE deposits along the tubules. This report describes a new hazard of rifampin therapy that might have developed, in part, because of coexisting hepatic dysfunction.
The epidemiology of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity is not fully understood. Experimental studies in healthy human volunteers indicate aminoglycosides cause proximal tubular damage in most patients, but rarely, if ever, cause glomerular or tubular dysfunction. Clinical trials of aminoglycosides in seriously ill patients indicate that the relative risk for developing acute renal failure during therapy ranges from 8 to 10 and that the attributable risk is 70% to 80%. Further analysis of these data suggests that the duration of therapy, plasma aminoglycoside levels, liver disease, advanced age, high initial estimated creatinine clearance and, possibly, female gender all increase the risk for nephrotoxicity. Other causes of acute renal failure, such as shock, appear to have an additive effect. Predictive models have been developed from these analyses that should be useful for identifying patients at high risk. These models may also be useful in developing insights into the pathophysiology of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity.
To gain insights into the significance of presenilins (PS) in the pathogenetic mechanisms of early-onset familial Alzheimer disease (FAD), we expressed cDNAs for wild-type PS2 and PS2 with the Volga German (N141I) mutation in cultured cells and then examined the metabolism of the transfected proteins and their effect on the C-terminal properties of secreted amyloid beta protein (A beta). PS2 was identified as a 50- to 55-kDa protein, which was cleaved to produce N-terminal fragments of 35-40 kDa and C-terminal fragments of 19-23 kDa. The Volga German (N141I) mutation did not cause any significant change in the metabolism of PS2. COS-1 cells doubly transfected with cDNAs for N141I mutant PS2 and human beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) or a C-terminal fragment thereof, as well as mouse Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with N141I mutant PS2 alone, secreted 1.5- to 10-fold more A beta ending at residues 42 (or 43) [A beta42(43)] compared with those expressing the wild-type PS2. These results strongly suggest that the PS2 mutation (N141I) linked to FAD alters the metabolism of A beta/betaAPP to foster the production of the form of A beta that most readily deposits in amyloid plaques. Thus, mutant PS2 may lead to AD by altering the metabolism of A beta/betaAPP.
We tested whether gadolinium-based contrast agent is less nephrotoxic than iodinated-contrast media.
Iodinated contrast agents are nephrotoxic. Some data suggest that gadolinium-based contrast agent may be less nephrotoxic than iodinated-contrast media.
Twenty-five consecutive patients with chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine concentration > or = 2.0 mg/dl and/or clearance < or = 40 ml/min), referred to our institution for coronary procedures, were assigned to receive gadolinium-based contrast agents, a solution of gadolinium chelates diluted 3:1 by iso-osmolality contrast media (Gadolinium-based group). A control group of 32 patients with comparable clinical characteristics and treated with iodinated iso-osmolality contrast agent alone (Iodinated-based group) was selected from our database and compared with the Gadolinium-based group. In all cases, prophylactic administration of 0.45% saline intravenously and NAC (1200 mg orally twice daily) was used.
Baseline creatinine levels and creatinine clearance were similar in the 2 groups (Gadolinium-based group = 2.30 [IQR: 2.01-2.68] mg/dl and 33 +/- 13 ml/min; Iodinated-based group = 2.24 [IQR: 2.05-2.65] mg/dl and 30 +/- 10 ml/min; P > 0.05 for all). Increase of at least 0.5 mg/dl of the creatinine concentration 48 hr after the procedure occurred in 7/25 (28%) patients in the Gadolinium-based group and in 2/32 (6.5%) patients in the Iodinated-based group (P = 0.034; OR = 4.48; 95% CI = 1.01-19.17). Renal failure requiring temporary dialysis occurred in 2 (8%) patients in the Gadolinium-based group and in none in the Iodinated-based group (P = 0.19).
The strategy of gadolinium-based contrast agent administration does not seem to reduce the rate of CAN, as compared to the iodinated iso-osmolality contrast agent in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
The pharmacokinetics and side effects of a single oral 900-mg dose of phenytoin sodium were studied in six healthy men. Nine 100-mg phenytoin sodium capsules were administered with water to six fasting healthy men. Phenytoin plasma levels were measured by gas chromatography for up to 48 hours after dosing. Patients were observed and tested for gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurologic side effects. Peak total (bound and free) plasma phenytoin levels were within the therapeutic range (10--20 microgram/ml) for two subjects and close (not less than 8.39 microgram/ml) for the remaining four. Peak free drug levels were 1.01--1.60 microgram/ml. Time to reach total and free peak plasma levels was long and variable (6--14 hours and 2--10 hours, respectively). Phenytoin protein binding (11.9--13.6%) was relatively stable among patients and at various plasma levels. A few mild transient side effects were noted; most occurred within two to four hours after dosing. Sinus bradycardia and a shortened PR interval were noted in two patients but did not correlate with peak plasma phenytoin levels. It appears that an oral loading dose of phenytoin sodium may be useful in ambulatory patients but further study of its side effects is recommended.
No adequate topical therapy is available for pruritus. As little is known about the local influence of antihistamines and topical anaesthetics on the pruritic effect of histamine, we studied these agents in 12 volunteers. The antipruritic effect of 15-min topical application of dimethindene maleate (Fenistil gel) and different agents (Optiderm, EMLA, Xylocaine-Salbe 5%) on subsequent focal histamine stimulus (20 mC) given by iontophoresis was evaluated. The results were compared with those of pretreatment with the corresponding placebo creams and observations on skin. Wheal and flare areas were evaluated planimetrically. Itch or pain ratings were entered on a scale every minute over a 24-min period. The examination also comprised alloknesis, i.e. elicitation of perifocal itch sensation by usually non-itch-inducing (e.g. mechanical) stimuli. Remarkably, all topically applied substances, regardless of antihistaminic or anaesthetic potential, reduced the area of alloknesis significantly. This is likely to be a result of diminished excitability of the cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Itching was significantly reduced by all active substances, including the placebo cream corresponding to Optiderm, which might be due to the presence of urea.
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common after thyroidectomy. Granisetron, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, is more effective than the traditional antiemetics droperidol and metoclopramide for the prevention of PONV after thyroidectomy. Ramosetron, another new selective antagonist of 5-HT3 receptor, has been shown to have more potent and longer-acting properties than granisetron against cisplatin-induced emesis in ferrets.
This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and tolerability of granisetron and ramosetron for the prevention of PONV after thyroidectomy.
In this randomized, double-blind study, patients received granisetron 3 mg or ramosetron 0.3 mg intravenously at the end of surgery. A standard general anesthetic technique and postoperative analgesia were used. Emetic episodes and safety were assessed during the first 24 hours and the second 24 hours after anesthesia.
Eighty patients (15 men, 65 women) aged 33 to 58 years were included in the study. Each study group consisted of 40 patients. There were no differences between groups with regard to patient demographics. The percentage of patients who were emesis free (no nausea, no retching, no vomiting) 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia was 83% (33 of 40) with granisetron and 88% (35 of 40) with ramosetron; the corresponding rates 24 to 48 hours after anesthesia were 63% (25 of 40) and 90% (36 of 40), respectively (P = 0.004). The safety profile of the two 5-HT3 receptor antagonists was comparable, as no clinically serious adverse effects caused by the study drug were observed in either of the groups.
Prophylactic antiemetic therapy with ramosetron was comparable to therapy with granisetron for the prevention of PONV 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia in patients who underwent thyroidectomy; 24 to 48 hours after anesthesia, ramosetron was more ef- fective than granisetron for prophylaxis against PONV in this population.
The cases of 10 children with acute and recurrent infection of the urinary tract are presented. Their ages were between 7 weeks and 9 years. Five of the children had been previously treated with a combination of sulfisoxazole, ampicillin, mandelamine and nitrofurantion and four of these children had "breakthrough" infections. When trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was administered twice weekly no further infections were noted in four of these five patients. The second group of five children were started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole from the start of their infection and treatment was continued twice weekly for 5 to 7 months. No recurrence of infection of the urine has been detected up to the present time. It is concluded that treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole initiated at the outset of urinary tract infection and twice weekly is a valuable drug in children, provided the organism responsible for the infection is sensitive to this agent.
Although described in the literature as a powerful vasodilator, bromocriptine has been noted to cause vasospasm and hypertension. Two cases are presented where administration of bromocriptine in the puerperium was associated with massive myocardial infarction. These incidents suggest the possibility that bromocriptine occasionally displays the vasoconstrictor effects of other (nonhydrogenated) ergot alkaloids.
To explore the ionic mechanisms of memory deficits induced by cholinergic lesion, whole-cell patch clamp recording techniques in combination with single-cell RT-PCR were used to characterize delayed rectifier potassium currents (IK) in acutely isolated hippocampal pyramidal neurons of scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment rats. Scopolamine could induce deficits in spatial memory of rats. The peak amplitude and current density of IK measured in hippocampal pyramidal neurons were increased from 1.2+/-0.6 nA and 38+/-19 pA/pF of the control group (n=12) to 1.8+/-0.5 nA and 62+/-24 pA/pF (n=48, P<0.01) of the scopolamine-treated group. The steady-state activation curve of IK was shifted about 8 mV (P<0.01) in the direction of hyperpolarization in scopolamine-treated rats. The mRNA level of Kv2.1 was increased (P<0.01) in the scopolamine-treated group, but there was no significant change of Kv1.5 mRNA level. The present study demonstrated for the first time that IK was enhanced significantly in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment rats. The increase of Kv2.1 mRNA expression in hippocampal pyramidal cells might be responsible for the enhancement of IK and could be the ionic basis of the memory deficits induced by scopolamine.
