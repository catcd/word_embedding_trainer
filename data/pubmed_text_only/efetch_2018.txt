A 67-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) after 5 months of D-penicillamine (250 mg/day) treatment. Light microscopy study showed severe glomerulonephritis with crescent formation in 60% of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole. Immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular IgG, IgA and C3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium. The patient was treated with steroid pulse, plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide and antiplatelet agents. A complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks. This new case of RPGN in the course of D-penicillamine treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and proteinuria in these patients. The prompt discontinuation of D-penicillamine and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case.
Although cocaine craving can persist for weeks after the last use and is thought to play a role in future relapses, few short, reliable, and valid instruments exist to measure craving. Therefore, we wished to examine the validity of the 4-item Voris Cocaine Craving Scale (VCCS), which was previously found reliable. A consecutive series of 41 recently withdrawn cocaine-dependent patients completed the 4-item VCCS and the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ), which was used as the criterion measure. The VCCS items 1 "craving," 2 "mood," and 3 "health" were significant and highly correlated with the CCQ total craving score. The VCCS may prove to be useful in future outcome studies involving cocaine craving and in routine clinical treatment.
Painful neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes. Particularly in the early stage of diabetic neuropathy, patients are characterized by burning feet, hyperalgesia to heat, and mechanical stimuli, as if residual nociceptors were sensitized. Such symptoms are barely explained by common pathophysiological concepts of diabetic neuropathy. Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats by streptozotocin (STZ). After 4 weeks behavioral testing (Plantar test, Randall-Selitto) was conducted. Basal and stimulated release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), Substance P (SP) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) from isolated skin and sciatic nerve were assessed by enzyme immunoassays. Electrophysiological properties of identified nociceptors under hyperglycemic, hypoxic, and acidotic conditions were investigated using the skin-nerve preparation. The diabetic rats showed hyperalgesia to heat and pressure stimulation. The basal CGRP/SP release was reduced, but chemical stimulation with bradykinin induced greater release of SP, CGRP and PGE(2) than in control animals. In contrast, capsaicin-stimulated CGRP release was reduced in sciatic nerves. Hypoxia per se lowered von Frey thresholds of most C-nociceptors to half. Hyperglycemic hypoxia induced ongoing discharge in all diabetic but not control C-fibers which was further enhanced under acidosis. Sensory and neurosecretory nociceptor functions are sensitized in diabetes. Diabetic C-fibers show exaggerated sensitivity to hyperglycemic hypoxia with and without additional acidosis, conditions that are thought to mimic ischemic episodes in diabetic nerves. Ongoing C-fiber discharge is known to induce spinal sensitization. Together with altered receptor and ion channel expressions this may contribute to painful episodes in diabetic neuropathy.
There are limited published data describing the relative efficacy of available treatment options in younger versus older patients with persistent asthma.
To compare the efficacy of fluticasone propionate (FP) and zafirlukast (Z) in younger (12 to 49 years of age) versus older (50 years and older) patients with asthma.
A retrospective analysis of five randomized, double-blind, double-dummy studies 4 to 12 weeks in duration of 1,742 patients <50 years of age and 243 patients aged 50 years or older. Interventions were inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP) 88 microg, oral Z 20 mg, or placebo twice daily.
Treatment with FP resulted in significantly greater improvements than Z in all efficacy measurements (except for nighttime awakenings) regardless of age. In older patients, treatment with FP significantly increased pulmonary function compared with Z: FEV (FP= +0.19 L; placebo = -0.34 L; Z = -0.06 L); AM peak expiratory flow rate [PEFR] (FP = +25 L/minute; placebo = -18 L/minute; Z = +4 L/minute); PM PEFR (FP = +24 L/minute; placebo = -24 L/minute; Z = +5 L/minute; P < or = 0.023; for all comparisons). Compared with Z, treatment with FP in older patients also resulted in significantly greater increases in the percentage of symptom-free days (25% vs 13%) and rescue-free days (35% vs 17%); and significantly greater reductions in albuterol use (-1.6 vs -0.3 puffs/day) and the percentage of patients with exacerbations (2.7% vs 14.3%; P < or = 0.031).
Regardless of age, treatment with FP in patients with asthma significantly improved pulmonary function and overall asthma control. In contrast, treatment with Z in older patients with asthma resulted in small improvements in asthma symptoms, whereas lung function improved minimally or not at all, and exacerbations increased. These data suggest that FP effectively controls inflammation in older patients, whereas Z may mask inflammation and may not provide the level of bronchodilatory or anti-inflammatory activity needed for effective asthma control in older patients.
Under conditions prevailing in an experimental chlorocalcium arrhythmia in rats an anti-arrhythmic action of the sympatholytic-rausedyl, the gamma-adrenolytic-dihydroergo toxin, the beta-adrenolytic--obsidan, the M-cholinolytics--atropine and benactyzine was ascertained. The N-cholinolytics tropacin and hexamethonium had no effect on the parameters and the outcome of the chlorocalcium arrhythmia, whereas the M-cholinomimetic-- carbacholine potentiated the arrhythmogenic action of calcium chloride. The mechanism of the chlorocalcium arrhythmia development the authors attribute to an intensified discharge of epinephrine from the functional depot of the sympathetic nerve endings and to sensitization of the alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors of the myocardium to the mediator. In the genesis of arrhythmia the participation of M-cholinoreceptors of the myocardium is presumed.
We studied the chronic effects of chlorpromazine (CPZ) on the myocardium of rats using light and electron microscopy. Wistar strain rats were divided into two groups and given either normal saline or CPZ intraperitoneally at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight/day for 30 consecutive days. Myocardial degeneration, atrophic muscle fiber, and myocardial fibrosis were observed by light microscopy in all CPZ-treated rats. Ultrastructural alterations of the myocardium were also found in all CPZ-treated rats. They consisted of contracted myofibers, mitochondriosis, degenerated mitochondria, dilated sarcoplasmic reticulum, and increased collagen fibers. However, no abnormal histologic or ultrastructural changes were observed in the normal saline-treated rats. We therefore conclude that a chronic administration of a sedative dose of CPZ causes myocardial damage in rats.
A 29-year-old woman suffered fatal hemorrhagic pyelitis, ureteritis and cystitis after receiving 4,800 mg./m.2 cyclophosphamide in preparation for marrow transplantation despite intravenous hydration and a Foley catheter. Cyclophosphamide-induced urothelial damage is not limited to the bladder and upper tract monitoring also is necessary.
In a murine model system, glutamic acid has demonstrated host protective properties during administration of vincristine (VCR). Subsequently, glutamic acid has been evaluated in patients receiving VCR during adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II carcinoma of the breast. The cumulative VCR dosage and toxicities incurred in 16 patients receiving glutamic acid have been compared to those observed in 88 patients who previously received VCR without glutamic acid in the same chemotherapy program. All patients received VCR 1.0 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks with dose modification for neurotoxicity. Treatment patients received glutamic acid 1.5 grams p.o. daily in three divided doses during the induction course. Of the 16 treatment patients, 9 (56%) received 100% ideal dosage of VCR during induction therapy whereas only 24 of 88 (27%) comparison patients attained this dosage level (p less than .025). Gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities were similar in both groups. These preliminary results suggest the need for an expanded trial of this agent during administration of VCR.
To determine the incidence of cardiotoxicity in infants and children who receive continuous nebulized albuterol (CNA) for bronchospasm.
Prospective, case series.
A university pediatric intensive care and pediatric subacute units.
Nineteen infants and children who received CNA for at least 24 hours.
None.
Creatinine phosphokinase (CK) was measured at the time of admission and then at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours while the patient received CNA. Isoenzyme CK-MB fractions were measured if CK concentration was > or = 250 IU/L. One electrocardiogram was obtained for each patient during CNA treatment. All patients had continuous cardiac monitoring during continuous nebulization therapy.
Creatinine phosphokinase levels remained within normal limits for 16 patients during CNA treatment. Three patients had elevated CK and in two CK-MB fractions were elevated at one measurement. None of the electrocardiograms showed evidence of ischemia and no arrhythmias were noted during CNA therapy, even in the patients with elevated CK-MB fractions.
Continuous albuterol therapy appears to be safe in our patient population as there was no significant evidence of cardiotoxicity. The significance of the transient elevation of CK-MB without other evidence of cardiotoxicity remains to be determined.
Alfuzosin is a new alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist particularly effective in the symptomatic treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). The elimination of alfuzosin being almost entirely metabolic, the potential pharmacokinetic interaction with cimetidine (H2-receptor antagonist) was investigated in 10 healthy young subjects. Pharmacokinetics of alfuzosin were appraised as a 5 mg oral dose before, after one day and after 20 days of cimetidine (1 g/d) administration. An inhibition of the hepatic mixed function oxidase system by cimetidine was established by the oral antipyrine clearance test. Under these conditions, alfuzosin pharmacokinetics were only marginally affected by concomitant cimetidine administration. Surprisingly, a significantly shorter elimination half-life was found after 20 days on cimetidine (from 5.1 +/- 0.4 h to 4.4 +/- 0.5 h). This fact must be attributed to the large inter-individual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters reported for alfuzosin. Cmax and AUC increased up to 20% after cimetidine but without statistical significance. No side-effects on the association cimetidine-alfuzosin were reported. In conclusion, there is a lack of pharmacokinetic interaction on cimetidine-alfuzosin co-administration.
This case report clarifies an adverse reaction of antiplatelet therapy which has been a standard prophylactic method for patients harboring significant risks of thromboembolic events. A 71-year-old Japanese man who had been taking aspirin tablets (81 mg) for a year presented with sudden colic pain in the left flank region. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a significant perirenal hematoma of the left kidney. There were no pathological kidney conditions, such as renal tumors, calculi or vascular diseases, found by magnetic resonance imaging examination. After cessation of aspirin administration followed by conservative management, the hematoma completely disappeared 6 months later. This is the first documented case of spontaneous perirenal hematoma secondary to low-dose aspirin treatment. While such unpleasant events occur extraordinarily, this should be noted as a severe risk of antiplatelet therapy.
Primary gastric-carcinoma accounts for only 0.05% of pediatric gastrointestinal malignancies. Although elderly patients who have pernicious anemia are at greater risk of the development of atrophic gastritis and gastric carcinoma, pernicious anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency is extremely rare in otherwise healthy adolescents. The authors present a 14.5-year-old boy who had dimorphic anemia caused by vitamin B12 and iron deficiencies in whom atrophic gastritis and gastric carcinoma developed. To the best of our knowledge, this association has not been previously reported in children or adolescents.
A two years intervention study was carried out using permethrin impregnated bed nets in a hyperendemic area, in Irian Jaya, Indonesia. To assess the influence of this intervention on natural immunity, concurrent immunological studies to determine levels of antibodies to the circumsporozoite (CS) and ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) proteins were conducted. Prevalence and titers of immunoglobulins (Ig)G and IgG subclasses were periodically measured in 138 individuals (30 children under the age of ten and 108 villagers ten years old and older). In the younger group, seropositivity of total IgG against CS fluctuated according to the parasite infection rates; however, IgG seropositive reaction against RESA gradually increased. In the older age group, seropositivity of both kinds of antibodies was stable during the whole study period. Nevertheless, the geometric mean titers of total IgG against CS and RESA were significantly reduced in this latter group in individuals who contained these antibodies before and after intervention. The geometric mean titer of IgG3 subclass against RESA was decreased at a highly significant level (p = 0.0005), and that of IgG4 against the same antigen was also decreased although to a lesser extent (p = 0.02).
The effect of systemic administration of the cannabinoid antagonist SR 141716A (N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxyamide) on penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine was investigated in rats. SR 141716A (2 mg/kg, i.p.) administered 40 min before apomorphine (40 and 80 microg/kg, s.c.) increased the number of penile erection and yawning responses. The administration of cannabinoid agonist Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) 15 min before apomorphine (40 and 80 microg/kg, s.c.) did not affect penile erection, however it decreased yawning. The present results provide additional evidence that cannabinoid agonists interfere with dopaminergic systems and that SR 141716A together with a dopaminergic agonist could be useful to potentiate dopaminergic activity.
FGF-2 is important for stem cell proliferation, neocortical development and adult neuronal survival and growth. Reduced frontal cortical FGF-2 expression is described in major depression and is attenuated by antidepressants. We determined the distribution of hippocampal FGF-2 and its receptor (FGFR1) mRNA in post-mortem brains of people who suffered from major depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and those of controls.
FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNA were measured within hippocampal CA1, CA4 regions and the dentate gyrus (DG), using in situ hybridization. Within hippocampal regions, cellular staining was compared between diagnostic groups, using repeated measures analysis of variance.
The density of FGF-2 mRNA+ cells in CA4 was reduced in depression compared to controls. The percentage of FGFR1 mRNA+ cells was higher in depression (CA1 and CA4) and schizophrenia (CA4) than in controls. FGFR1 mRNA expression was higher in depression than in the other groups in CA1, CA4 and DG. Overall FGF-2 mRNA expression was higher in DG than in CA1 and CA4.
We found raised measures of FGFR1 mRNA+ in major depression and, less so, in schizophrenia, along with reduced FGF-2 mRNA density in depression. Perturbations of FGF regulation could be relevant to the pathogenesis of both disorders as FGF-2 and FGFR1 are implicated in normal hippocampal synaptology, stem cell recruitment, and connectivity, and are modulated by corticosteroids.
Paternal germline exposure to organophosphorous pesticides (OP) has been associated with reproductive failures and adverse effects in the offspring. Methyl-parathion (Me-Pa), a worldwide-used OP, has reproductive adverse effects and is genotoxic to sperm, possibly via oxidative damage. This study investigated the stages of spermatogenesis susceptible to be targeted by Me-Pa exposure that impact on spermatozoa function and their ability to fertilize. Male mice were exposed to Me-Pa (20 mg/kg bw, i.p.) and spermatozoa from epididymis-vas deferens were collected at 7 or 28 days post-treatment (dpt) to assess the effects on maturing spermatozoa and spermatocytes, respectively. Spermatozoa were examined for DNA damage by nick translation (NT-positive cells) and SCSA (%DFI), lipoperoxidation (LPO) by malondialdehyde production, sperm function by spontaneous- and induced-acrosome reactions (AR), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by using the JC-1 fluorochrome, and fertilization ability by an in vitro assay and in vivo mating. Alterations on DNA integrity (%DFI and NT-positive cells) in spermatozoa collected at 7 and 28 dpt, and decreases in sperm quality and induced-AR were observed; reduced MMP and LPO were observed at 7 dpt only. Negative correlations between LPO and sperm alterations were found. Altered sperm functional parameters evaluated either in vitro or in vivo were associated with reduced fertilization rates at both times. These results show that Me-Pa exposure of maturing spermatozoa and spermatocytes affects many sperm functional parameters that result in a decreased fertilizing capacity. Oxidative stress seems to be a likely mechanism of the detrimental effects of Me-Pa exposure in male germ cells.
Numerous publications and research studies on isoflavones have prompted a nationwide increase in the consumption of soy-based foods and supplements in the United States. Isoflavones are natural endocrine active compounds generally considered to promote health and prevent or slow the onset of certain chronic diseases such as osteoporosis. The beneficial effects of soy isoflavones on bone may, however, be life-stage specific and dependent on the estrogen receptor number and endogenous hormone milieu. Perimenopausal and early menopausal women may therefore be more receptive to the therapeutic effects of isoflavones on bone loss prior to the diminution of estrogen receptors that occurs in the postmenopausal years, whereas laboratory studies in developmental age range animals have demonstrated the potential for adverse effects following exposure to high levels of soy isoflavones. Clinical studies in developing humans that either support or refute findings in animal studies are lacking. The effects of chronic consumption of high levels of soy isoflavones at each life stage to assess risk-benefit ratios should be a high priority of research.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been suggested to improve the function of arterial endothelium and smooth muscle not only through inhibition of angiotensin II formation and reduction of blood pressure, but also via additional pathways, e.g. potentiation of endogenous kinins and enhancement of endothelial autacoid formation. Therefore, we investigated whether 10-week-long quinapril therapy (10 mg kg-1 day-1) could beneficially influence the function of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro in deoxycorticosterone-NaCl-treated Wistar-Kyoto rats, a model of hypertension which is known to be resistant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The quinapril treatment had no long-term blood pressure-lowering effect nor did it reduce the associated cardiac hypertrophy in deoxycorticosterone-NaCl hypertension. In noradrenaline-precontracted arterial rings the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and adenosine 5'-diphosphate as well as the endothelium-independent relaxations to nitroprusside and isoprenaline were clearly attenuated in the deoxycorticosterone-NaCl-treated rats. However, the quinapril therapy was without significant effect on any of these dilatory responses. In the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, the relaxations to acetylcholine in untreated and quinapril-treated hypertensive animals were practically absent, whereas in normotensive rats distinct relaxations to higher concentrations of acetylcholine were still present. Interestingly, when endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization was prevented by precontracting the preparations with potassium chloride, no differences were found in relaxations to acetylcholine and adenosine 5'-diphosphate between the study groups. Exogenous bradykinin induced small comparable contractions in endothelium-intact mesenteric arterial rings from all study groups. In conclusion, the 10-week-long quinapril therapy did not have any significant effects on arterial function in deoxycorticosterone-NaCl hypertensive rats. Therefore, the present results stress the roles of reduced blood pressure and diminished angiotensin II formation in the beneficial vascular effects of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in the present model of hypertension. Furthermore, since the relaxations to acetylcholine and adenosine 5'-diphosphate in the deoxycorticosterone-NaCl-treated rats were attenuated in the absence and presence of nitric oxide synthase inhibition but not under conditions which prevented hyperpolarization, impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation to agonists can be attributed to diminished endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization in this model of hypertension.
Methylmercury (MeHg) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant with known neurodevelopmental effects. In humans, prenatal exposures primarily occur through maternal consumption of contaminated fish. In this study, we evaluated the association between prenatal exposure to MeHg and titers of total immunoglobulins (Ig) and specific autoantibodies in both mothers and fetuses by analyzing maternal and cord blood serum samples. We examined multiple immunoglobulin isotypes to determine if these biomarkers could inform as to fetal or maternal responses since IgG but not IgM can cross the placenta. Finally, we evaluated serum cytokine levels to further characterize the immune response to mercury exposure. The study was conducted using a subset of serum samples (N=61 pairs) collected from individuals enrolled in a population surveillance of MeHg exposures in the Brazilian Amazon during 2000/2001. Serum titers of antinuclear and antinucleolar autoantibodies were measured by indirect immunofluorescence. Serum immunoglobulins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and BioPlex multiplex assay. Serum cytokines were measured by BioPlex multiplex assay. In this population, the geometric mean mercury level was within the 95th percentile for US populations of women of childbearing age but the upper level of the range was significantly higher. Fetal blood mercury levels were higher (1.35 times) than those in their mothers, but highly correlated (correlation coefficient [r]=0.71; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.89). Total IgG (r=0.40; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.62) and antinuclear autoantibody (odds ratio [OR]=1.05; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.08) levels in paired maternal and fetal samples were also associated; in contrast, other immunoglobulin (IgM, IgE, and IgA) levels were not associated between pairs. Total IgG levels were significantly correlated with both maternal (r=0.60; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.96) and cord blood mercury levels (r=0.61; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.97), but individual isotypes were not. Serum cytokines, interleukin-1β (r=0.37; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.73), interleukin-6 (r=0.34; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.65), and tumor necrosis factor-α (r=0.24; 95% CI: 0.015, 0.47), were positively correlated between maternal and fetal samples. Antinuclear and antinucleolar autoantibody titer and serum cytokine levels, in either maternal or cord blood, were not significantly associated with either maternal or cord blood mercury levels. These data provide further evidence that there are likely IgG biomarkers of mercury-induced immunotoxicity in this population since IgG levels were elevated with increased, and associated with, mercury exposure. However, unlike previous data from adult males and non-pregnant females, we found no evidence that antinuclear and antinucleolar autoantibody titer is a reliable biomarker of mercury immunotoxicity in this population.
Studies that used prolonged contrast media infusion in canine arteries have generated controversy regarding the arrhythmogenic potential of low osmolarity, nonionic contrast agents. In order to establish the relative safety of these agents in the more typical setting of bolus injections, 4 ml intracoronary bolus injections of Hypaque-76 (n = 54), Iohexol-350 (n = 51), and Iohexol-140 (n = 51) were given in random order to 10 anesthetized, open-chest dogs undergoing programmed cardiac stimulation. Hemodynamics and electrocardiogram were monitored during stimulation, both during and for 2 minutes after the end of contrast infusion. Occurrence of evoked single and coupled premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia did not differ statistically among agents. Sustained ventricular tachycardia (five episodes) and ventricular fibrillation (seven episodes) occurred only after Hypaque-76 injections (p less than 0.002). These results differ from those in studies that use continuous contrast infusion and suggest that low osmolarity nonionic contrast agents are as safe as high osmolarity nonionic contrast media. Both appear safer than ionic contrast material.
In this study haloperidol appeared to affect the performance on a selected category of cognitive tasks considered to represent shifting aptitude. A pretest--post-test design was used with two groups of subjects: 17 patients suffering from idiopathic spasmodic torticollis, and 17 controls who were matched for age and intelligence. The results are discussed in relation to previous findings on haloperidol and cognition, shifting disorder in Parkinson's disease and changes in behavioural organization found in animals with an experimentally induced dopaminergic hypoactivity.
We have studied 23 patients receiving penicillamine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis to determine the prevalence of penicillamine-induced elastosis. One female patient had pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like skin changes and bramble-bush elastosis without calcification in the involved skin. Penicillamine elastosis was present in the joint capsule in 62% of eight patients or 64% of II joints examined and was detected in joint capsules after as little as I year of treatment.
The effect of nisoldipine, a new calcium antagonist, on rats with renovascular hypertension was evaluated. Eight one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats (1K, 1C rats) given nisoldipine 10 mg/kg for 4 weeks were compared with eight 1K, 1C hypertensive control rats. Fifteen other rats underwent sham-operation (right nephrectomy, no clip), of which eight received nisoldipine in the same dosage. A significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) was achieved in the nisoldipine groups: from 154 +/- 4 to 107 +/- 7.5 mmHg in the 1K, 1C group (P less than 0.005) and from 117 +/- 4.2 to 89 +/- 5.4 mmHg in the sham-operated rats (P less than 0.01). The significant decrease in BP was maintained for only 6 days, but did not rise markedly throughout the entire study. Four 1K, 1C control rats died before term, two after 14 days and two after 20 days. There was no significant change in the pulse rate. Sugar and cholesterol levels in the nisoldipine groups remained constant. Nisoldipine caused a natriuresis without kaluresis in both groups: sodium excretion in the 1K, 1C rats increased from 0.25 +/- 0.05 to 2.32 +/- 0.2 mmol/day, and from 0.34 +/- 0.1 to 1.85 +/- 0.15 mmol/day in the sham-operated rats. A slight decrease in aldosterone levels in the 1K, 1C rats was observed. It appears that the combination of both natriuretic and vasodilatory effects during nisoldipine treatment results in a favourable hypotensive response in 1K, 1C hypertensive rats.
Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a severe chemotherapy-resistant malignancy associated with prolonged infection by the human T cell-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) retrovirus. Although the Tax viral transactivator is clearly an oncogene, the role of its continuous expression in the maintenance of the transformed phenotype is controversial. Because arsenic trioxide (As) and interferon alpha (IFN) synergize to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of ATL cells both ex vivo and in vitro, we investigated the effects of As alone and As/IFN combination on gene networks in HTLV-1-infected leukemic cells. The As/IFN combination reduced Tax expression and, accordingly, reversed the Tax-induced constitutive nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Using DNA microarray analyses, we demonstrated that As rapidly and selectively blocks the transcription of NF-kappaB-dependent genes in HTLV-1-infected cells only. Reversal of NF-kappaB activation by As alone resulted from dramatic stabilization of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-epsilon, independently of IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity modulation or Tax degradation. In contrast, only the As/IFN combination induced late and massive down-regulation of cell cycle-regulated genes, concomitantly with Tax degradation by the proteasome and cell death induction, indicating the importance of continuous Tax expression for ATL cell survival. These 2 successive events likely account for the potent and specific effects of the As/IFN combination in ATL.
We investigated the effects of postnatal exposure to benz[a]anthracene (B[a]A) and benzo[k]fluoranthene (B[k]F) on the development of the rat uterus. Neonates were injected on each postnatal days 1-14 with B[a]A (0.1, 1.0 or 10.0mg/kg), B[k]F (0.1, 1.0 or 5.0mg/kg), ethynylestradiol (EE; 1.0μg/kg) or a vehicle. The rats were killed on day 23. All doses of B[a]A and B[k]F induced a reduction of the uterine weight, a reduction of the estrogen receptor α expression in the luminal epithelium, glandular epithelium and stromal cells. Moreover, the uterotrophic response to EE (3-day administration of 1.0μg/kg on postnatal days 20-22) in rats exposed to B[a]A, B[k]F and EE was lower than in controls. The study showed that postnatal exposure to B[a]A and B[k]F resultes in morphological and functional disorders of the immature rat uterus.
