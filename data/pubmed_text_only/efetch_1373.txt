In unstressed rats, doses of 1 mg/kg and higher of diazepam produced tachycardia without changing blood pressure. Sub-chronic dosing (10 mg/kg/day for 4 days) resulted in increased magnitude and duration of the tachycardia. This diazepam induced tachycardia was unaffected by reserpine, slightly blocked by propranolol and abolished by atropine pretreatment. In animals anesthetized with ketamine, diazepam did not change heart rate or blood pressure. When animals were stressed by restraint, heart rate and blood pressure increased markedly. Diazepam did not affect the stress-induced tachycardia but reduced the stress-induced hypertension. These studies show that diazepam has no effect on heart rate or blood pressure in anesthetized animals, has no effect on blood pressure in conscious, unstressed animals but increases heart rate significantly probably by central vagal inhibition and, does not antagonize a stress-induced tachycardia but antagonizes stress-induced increases in blood pressure probably by a reduction in peripheral sympathetic tone.
The effect of rearing condition and prenatal exposure to cocaine on maternal behaviors was examined. Sprague-Dawley dams were given SC injections of 40 mg/kg/3cc cocaine HCl (C40) or saline (LC) daily from gestational days 8-20. Maternal behavior was assessed in treated dams rearing their biological pups (LC/LC; C40/C40), treated dams rearing untreated pups (LC/FOS; C40/FOS), and foster dams rearing treated pups (FOS/LC; FOS/C40). All dams were monitored for home cage behavior (time eating, drinking, and with pups) for 2 h during both the light and dark cycle on postnatal day 4 (P4), pup retrieval on P5-P9, and maternal aggression to a female intruder (latency to the first attack, number of attacks, boxing, pins, intruder time spent submissive and motionless) on P10. No differences were observed in nest behavior or in tests of pup retrieval among the six groups. Dams rearing their biological litter (LC/LC and C40/C40) were significantly quicker to initiate the first attack when compared to all other groups. This increased aggression was maintained throughout the test session in the C40/C40 dams who made significantly more intruder attacks than all other groups, with the intruder spending significantly more time in a submissive posture (lying on back). In contrast, LC/LC dams did not exhibit an increased number of attacks during the test, apparently responding to an increased freezing in their intruders with a reduction in aggressive behavior. Taken together these findings suggest that prior cocaine exposure results in alterations in maternal aggression that is evident when these dams rear their own pups.
The impact of rearing condition was assessed in Sprague-Dawley dams given 40 mg/kg cocaine (C40) or saline (LC control) subcutaneously (SC) from gestational days 8-20 and their offspring. Treated pups reared by their biological dams (LC/LC; C40/C40), treated pups reared by surrogate dams (FOS/LC; FOS/C40), and foster pups raised by treated dams (LC/FOS; C40/FOS) were examined. On postnatal day 7 (P7), pups received either 0 (unpaired) 2, 3, or 4 pairings of an odor and footshock and were tested for their aversion to this odor. Foster and LC pups, regardless of rearing condition, exhibited significant odor aversions following either 2, 3, or 4 training trials. In contrast, C40 pups reared by surrogate dams required 4 trials to acquire the aversion, and C40 pups reared by their own dams did not exhibit conditioning even after 4 trials. At P17, no differences were seen among the groups in the aversion formed to an auditory or an olfactory stimulus that was paired with footshock. At P60, shock-elicited aggression among pairs of siblings was examined. Regardless of prenatal exposure condition, offspring reared by dams given cocaine showed a decreased latency to the first aggressive contact, an effect that was evident without any alteration in shock sensitivity. Together these data suggest that being reared by a dam previously exposed to cocaine has an impact on offspring behavioral function apart from the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure per se. The implications of the data regarding the cognitive performance of pups exposed prenatally to cocaine are also discussed.
Pesticides acting at GABAA receptors may induce convulsions in man and animals, but the mechanisms responsible for their convulsant activity are not fully explained. The following excitatory amino acid antagonists were studied for their protective action in mice intoxicated with chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane): the competitive NMDA antagonist: 3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propenyl-1- phosphonic acid (D-CPPene, 20 mg/kg), the non-competitive NMDA antagonist: dizocilpine (MK-801, 0.4 mg/kg), the glycine site antagonist of NMDA receptor: 2-phenyl-1,3-propane-diol dicarbamate (felbamate, 400 mg/kg) and the competitive AMPA antagonist: 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX, 100 mg/kg). Systemic administration of an antagonist prior to lindane resulted in a strong anticonvulsant effect. D-CPPene, MK-801 and NBQX produced a marked increase of CD50 values of lindane for clonic convulsions. All the antagonists protected animals against tonic convulsions. Toxicity of lindane was potently reduced, as assessed 2, 24 and 120 hr after administration of the pesticide. Our results demonstrate that excitatory amino acid antagonists reduce convulsant properties and toxicity of lindane, suggesting that excitatory amino acid neurotransmission may be involved in its central action.
Hereditary pancreatitis (HP) is a rare, early-onset genetic disorder characterized by epigastric pain and often more serious complications. We now report that an Arg-His substitution at residue 117 of the cationic trypsinogen gene is associated with the HP phenotype. This mutation was observed in all HP affected individuals and obligate carriers from five kindreds, but not in individuals who married into the families nor in 140 unrelated individuals. X-ray crystal structure analysis, molecular modelling, and protein digest data indicate that the Arg 117 residue is a trypsin-sensitive site. Cleavage at this site is probably part of a fail-safe mechanism by which trypsin, which is activated within the pancreas, may be inactivated; loss of this cleavage site would permit autodigestion resulting in pancreatitis.
A patient with recurrent thrompophlebitis had sterile pyuria with white blood cell casts and transient, mild renal failure during therapy with sulfinpyrazone. These abnormalities resolved on cessation of therapy, but similar changes in the urinary sediment recurred during therapy with sulfinpyrazone. These abnormalities resolved on cessation of therapy, but similar changes in the urinary sediment recurred during a second course of sulfinpyrazone therapy.
Two matched groups of patients with Hodgkin's disease undergoing a staging laparotomy received thiopentone, pancuronium bromide or suxamethonium 1.0 mg kg-1 (group 2) to facilitate tracheal intubation. There were no differences in the sites or degree of postoperative myalgia between the groups. It is concluded that efforts to reduce the frequency of suxamethonium muscle pains in patients having major abdominal operations are not justified.
A 2-year-old spayed female Border Collie was treated with IV lipid emulsion (ILE) after ingesting 6 mg/kg (2.73 mg/lb) of an equine ivermectin anthelmintic paste 8 hours prior to examination.
On initial examination, the dog had stable cardiovascular signs but had diffuse muscle tremors and was hyperthermic. Neurologic evaluation revealed that the dog was ataxic and had mydriasis with bilaterally absent menace responses and pupillary light reflexes. The remaining physical examination findings were unremarkable. Results of CBC, serum biochemical analysis, venous blood gas analysis, and measurement of plasma lactate concentration were also within reference limits.
The dog was treated with ILE in addition to supportive care with IV fluid therapy and cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic monitoring. The use of ILE treatment was initiated in this patient on the basis of previous clinical and experimental evidence supporting its use for toxicosis resulting from lipid-soluble agents. An initial bolus of 1.5 mL/kg (0.68 mL/lb) of a 20% sterile lipid solution was administered IV over 10 minutes, followed by a constant rate infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min (0.11 mL/lb/min) over 60 minutes that was administered twice to treat clinical signs of ivermectin toxicosis. The dog was discharged from the hospital 48 hours after admission and was clinically normal within 4 days after ivermectin ingestion. Further diagnostic evaluation subsequently revealed that this dog was unaffected by the multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1) deletion, known as the ATP-binding cassette polymorphism.
Ivermectin toxicosis in veterinary patients can result in death without aggressive treatment, and severe toxicosis often requires mechanical ventilation and intensive supportive care. This is particularly true in dogs affected by the ATP-binding cassette polymorphism. Novel ILE treatment has been shown to be effective in human patients with lipid-soluble drug toxicoses, although the exact mechanism is unknown. In the patient in the present report, ILE was used successfully to treat ivermectin toxicosis, and results of serial measurement of serum ivermectin concentration supported the proposed lipid sink mechanism of action.
The activities of cytochrome oxidase (CYO) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in brains of progeny of rabbits treated with dichlorvos (DDVP) 6 mg/kg/day during last ten days of pregnancy were investigated. Biochemical estimation of mitochondrial fraction of the brain tissue and the histochemical studies of fresh cryostat slices were carried out in 1, 8 and 16 day old rabbits. In comparison with control animals the decrease in CYO and SDH activity and the disturbances in "enzymatic maturation" rythm were observed in progeny of rabbits submitted to treatment with DDVP. In neuropil the changes were more pronounced than in pericarium of the nerve cells. In the brain structures which are sensitive to the metabolic disturbances (Ammon horn) SDH activities decreased.
One hundred ninety-one patients with advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma were treated with either a combination of doxorubicin and a five-day course of cisplatin alternating with cyclophosphamide and hexamethylmelamine orally for 14 days (CHAP-5) or cyclophosphamide and cisplatin both administered intravenously (IV) on a single day at 3-week intervals (CP). At a median follow-up time of 45 months, treatment with each of these combinations resulted in the same remission rates (80% and 74%, respectively) and exactly the same progression-free survival and overall survival (median, 26 months). Despite adequate hydration, more renal toxicity was encountered in the CP-treated patients than in those who received CHAP-5. Disabling neurotoxicity and severe myelosuppression were encountered more frequently in the patients treated with CHAP-5. Because the toxicity was lower and CP treatment required shorter hospitalization, the single-day regimen was considered preferable for future use. The Karnofsky index was the only independent predictor for response, whereas both this index and the size of residual tumor before chemotherapy were predictive of survival. After correcting for other prognostic factors, it was determined that tumor size associated with improved survival was less than 1 cm. The site of metastases in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IV patients did not influence survival within this category. The results of this study confirm our previous findings that patients with microscopic remnants at second-look have a survival similar to that of patients who are histopathologically free of disease. This makes the significance of so-called pathologically confirmed complete remission questionable. The survival benefit of debulking surgery performed during chemotherapy seems only minimal for patients in whom debulking has already been attempted before treatment. Like others, we have found the CP regimen to have a good therapeutic index.
Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) catalyzes the pyrophosphohydrolysis of inosine triphosphate to inosine monophosphate. Recently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ITPA gene, associated with decreased enzyme activity, have been reported. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that the 94C>A mutation is linked to flu-like symptoms, rash, and pancreatitis during azathioprine (AZA) therapy and to early AZA discontinuation. In this study, we investigated whether the enzyme phenotype is also related to adverse effects (AEs).
Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease who were treated with AZA (N=160; age 43±12 years) were included. Data were categorized into quartiles according to the ITPA activity. Information about the therapeutic regimen, AEs [leucopenia, increased hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase), flu-like symptoms, and pancreatitis], cotherapy, and comorbidity was obtained from the responsible clinicians and patients by using a standardized questionnaire. ITPA activity was measured by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography procedure. In patients with decreased ITPA activity, the 94C>A and IVS2+21A>C genotypes were determined.
AEs were reported significantly more often for patients with low ITPA activity than for patients with high ITPA activity; the highest odds ratio for occurrence of AEs was found to be below a threshold of 59.9 μmol/(gHb·h) [hemoglobin (Hb)]. Decreased ITPA activities [particularly <89.2 μmol/(gHb·h)] were frequently accompanied by leucopenias, whereas very low enzyme activities [<37.3 μmol/(gHb·h)] were associated with a higher incidence of increased liver enzymes.
The results demonstrate a relationship between low ITPA activity and AEs and support the idea that the determination of ITPA phenotype might be an appropriate alternative to genotyping.
One hundred twenty-four children and young adults with recurrent tumors, predominantly sarcomas, were treated with the combination of ifosfamide, etoposide, and the uroprotector, mesna (2-mercaptoethane sulphonate), in a phase II trial. The treatment regimen consisted of 12 cycles of therapy administered every 3 weeks. After evaluation of the tumor response to chemotherapy alone, radiation or surgery was used to eradicate residual sites of metastatic disease where possible. At the present time, 77 patients are evaluable for response to the chemotherapy; 43 of the patients have experienced a significant reduction in the tumor size in response to the chemotherapy alone (39 partial responses [PR] and four complete responses [CR]). Sixteen of 17 patients with Ewing's sarcoma, nine of 13 with rhabdomyosarcoma, four of eight with peripheral neuroepithelioma, three of eight with osteosarcoma, and 11 of 31 with other tumors have responded with a PR or CR. The toxicity of the regimen was acceptable. Moderate or severe toxicity evaluated on a per cycle basis included: neutropenia, 97%; thrombocytopenia, 32%; nephrotoxicity, less than 1%; mucositis, 1%; neurologic toxicity, 2%; nausea and vomiting, 13%; hemorrhagic cystitis, less than 1%. Fever was present after 33% of cycles and sepsis following 7%. One patient died due to sepsis and pancytopenia. At the present time, only seven of the 43 patients who responded to the chemotherapy regimen have relapsed, with a median follow-up of 10 weeks after the response. This drug combination is highly active in the treatment of recurrent sarcomas and other tumors in children and young adults.
The cause of oral-contraceptive-induced hypertension in certain susceptible subjects is obscure. We describe a woman who was receiving replacement doses of fludrocortisone acetate after adrenalectomy and hypophysectomy who developed high blood pressure while ingesting an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive. Renin substrate level was increased, but renin activity was suppressed and unresponsive to tilting. The patient developed a markedly exaggerated natriuresis when infused with saline. Both blood pressure and her responses to infused sodium and tilting normalized after discontinuance of the oral contraceptive medication. In this adrenalectomized patient, the estrogenic component of the pill acting synergistically with a fixed ("nonsuppressible") replacement dose of mineralocorticoid seems to have caused a volume-related hypertension.
Horner's syndrome is a rare complication of epidural analgesia for labor. Much more uncommon is trigeminal nerve palsy. Both complications may be attributed to a subdural localization of the catheter, as we demonstrated clinically by a repeat injection and patchy sympathetic block and with the typical image on epidurography.
A patient presented with decreased visual acuity and retinal findings compatible with chloroquine retinopathy 5 years after discontinuing regular usage of chloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis. A review of the literature on chloroquine retinopathy is outlined. In addition, the characteristic findings including fluorescein angiography, retinal physiologic studies, and symptoms are reviewed. Chloroquine retinopathy is dose related and essentially irreversible and often progressive once typical findings are noted. To our knowledge very delayed onset of chloroquine retinopathy is a relatively rare phenomenon but the medical and ophthalmic communities must be alerted to the possibly severe complications of this iatrogenic disease entity.
Nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, has greater vascular selectivity than other calcium channel antagonists and does not depress the intact myocardium in vivo. It should be taken on an empty stomach. Both rapid-release and coat-core formulations are available for clinical use, but only the coat-core formulation extends antihypertensive, antiischemic, and antianginal effects throughout the dosing interval when given once daily. The coat-core formulation in daily doses of 10 to 40 mg does not cause the proischemic effects reported with the rapid-release formulation. When given as monotherapy, the coat-core formulation is highly effective in lowering blood pressure to a similar extent as other long-acting calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The antihypertensive effects are potentiated when the coat-core formulation of nisoldipine is given in combination with lisinopril. In patients with stable angina pectoris nisoldipine coat-core increases exercise duration, reduces anginal frequency and myocardial ischemia, and is effective as monotherapy or in combination with a beta-blockers. In monotherapy the drug is as effective as other long-acting calcium channel blockers or a beta-blocker. The effects of nisoldipine coat-core in patients with heart failure are unclear at present.
The partial beta adrenoceptor agonist properties of cicloprolol, xamoterol and pindolol have been compared in vivo (anesthetized catecholamine-depleted or pithed rats) and in vitro (guinea pig or rat right atria and guinea pig tracheal muscle preparations) conditions. All three compounds increased heart rate in the former preparations, and their intrinsic activities relative to isoproterenol were 0.7, 0.65 and 0.45, respectively. The positive chronotropic effects of cicloprolol or xamoterol were competitively antagonized by betaxolol or propranolol; however, part of those induced by pindolol were resistant to these beta adrenoceptor antagonists. None of these compounds increased the spontaneous beating rate of isolated guinea pig atria; however, xamoterol only increased heart rate in isolated rat atria, and its intrinsic activity with respect to isoproterenol was 0.4. Pindolol, xamoterol and cicloprolol behaved as competitive beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists against isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in a pithed rat model. In order to mimic the intrinsic effects of the partial agonist drugs, control dose-response curves for isoproterenol were determined in pithed rats in which the base-line heart rate was elevated by thoracic spinal cord stimulation. In this in vivo preparation, xamoterol and pindolol were more potent beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists than cicloprolol; however, cicloprolol and xamoterol, in contrast to pindolol, were selective for beta-1 adrenoceptors. In isolated spontaneously beating guinea pig right atria, cicloprolol and xamoterol were equipotent beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists but were about 50 times less potent than pindolol. In isolated rat atria, the beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist potency of xamoterol was greater (pA2 = 8.7) than in guinea pig atria (pA2 = 7.8). The potencies of cicloprolol and pindolol did not vary between these species. In catecholamine-depleted rats, high i.v. doses of cicloprolol had vasodilator activity that was partly mediated by beta-2 adrenoceptors. In carbachol-contracted guinea pig trachea, cicloprolol and xamoterol, in contrast to pindolol, were relatively inactive against isoproterenol-induced relaxation. In conclusion, cicloprolol and xamoterol, similarly to pindolol, behave as agonists and antagonists of beta-1 adrenoceptors. However, only cicloprolol and xamoterol show an elevated degree of selectivity toward the beta-1 adrenoceptor subtype.
There are three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) subtypes which are commonly designated PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma and PPAR beta/delta. PPAR alpha activation increases high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol synthesis, stimulates "reverse" cholesterol transport and reduces triglycerides. PPAR gamma activation results in insulin sensitization and antidiabetic action. Until recently, the biological role of PPAR beta/delta remained unclear. However, treatment of obese animals by specific PPAR delta agonists results in normalization of metabolic parameters and reduction of adiposity. Combined treatments with PPAR gamma and alpha agonists may potentially improve insulin resistance and alleviate atherogenic dyslipidemia, whereas PPAR delta properties may prevent the development of overweight which typically accompanies "pure" PPAR gamma ligands. The new generation of dual-action PPARs--the glitazars, which target PPAR-gamma and PPAR-alpha (like muraglitazar and tesaglitazar) are on deck in late-stage clinical trials and may be effective in reducing cardiovascular risk, but their long-term clinical effects are still unknown. A number of glitazars have presented problems at a late stage of clinical trials because of serious side-effects (including ragaglitazar and farglitazar). The old and well known lipid-lowering fibric acid derivative bezafibrate is the first clinically tested pan--(alpha, beta/delta, gamma) PPAR activator. It is the only pan-PPAR activator with more than a quarter of a century of therapeutic experience with a good safety profile. Therefore, bezafibrate could be considered (indeed, as a "post hoc" understanding) as an "archetype" of a clinically tested pan-PPAR ligand. Bezafibrate leads to considerable raising of HDL cholesterol and reduces triglycerides, improves insulin sensitivity and reduces blood glucose level, significantly lowering the incidence of cardiovascular events and new diabetes in patients with features of metabolic syndrome. Clinical evidences obtained from bezafibrate-based studies strongly support the concept of pan-PPAR therapeutic approach to conditions which comprise the metabolic syndrome. However, from a biochemical point of view, bezafibrate is a PPAR ligand with a relatively low potency. More powerful new compounds with pan-PPAR activity and proven long-term safety should be highly effective in a clinical setting of patients with coexisting relevant lipid and glucose metabolism disorders.
Intramuscular methohexital is used in children for short-term anaesthesia. As a seizure was observed in two of our cases after administration of this barbiturate, an EEG study was performed. The EEG pattern was characterized by a particularly slow, sharp, high voltage stage with a decrease of fast rhythms (stage 3a), then fast and sharp rhythms becoming more and more frequent (stage 3b). These stages were particularly pronounced and prolonged in children over 3 years of age, with myoclonic jerks observed in 6 cases, beginning about 3 min after methohexital injection and at the same time as the clinical seizures. These results are discussed in terms of previously reported descriptions of barbiturate anaesthesia, and especially of i.m. or i.v. methohexital anaesthesia. This anaesthetic, although reliable and easy to use, should in our opinion be avoided in epileptic children.
Beta adrenergic agonists can lower serum potassium levels predominantly when they are administered by the parenteral route. Hypokalemia has been demonstrated with the use of albuterol given by the intramuscular, intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) routes as well as with SC epinephrine. The effect appears to be dose related. Certain patients might be at increased risk who are on medications that tend to lower potassium such as corticosteroids, theophylline, diuretics or digoxin. Further studies should be encouraged on the hypokalemic effect of all forms of beta agonists in view of their possible contribution toward arrhythmias and asthma deaths.
The objective of this randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of 329 adult patients requiring hospitalization was to compare the safety and efficacy of sparfloxacin at a dosage of 200 mg once daily (following a 400-mg loading dose on day 1) with those of amoxicillin given as a 1-g oral dose three times daily for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia suspected to be due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Success of treatment was determined by a combination of clinical assessment and chest radiography. Pneumococcal pneumonia was the confirmed diagnosis for 177 patients (54%). Overall rates of success among evaluable patients were equivalent between drugs, both at the end of treatment (sparfloxacin, 92%; amoxicillin, 87%) and at follow-up (sparfloxacin, 89%; amoxicillin, 84%). Sparfloxacin was well-tolerated and produced fewer gastrointestinal effects than amoxicillin. In conclusion, sparfloxacin is a safe and effective alternative to high-dose amoxicillin for the treatment of suspected pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia.
In a previous study, we demonstrated that a dextromethorphan analog, dimemorfan, has neuroprotective effects. Dextromethorphan and dimemorfan are high-affinity ligands at sigma1 receptors. Dextromethorphan has moderate affinities for phencyclidine sites, while dimemorfan has very low affinities for such sites, suggesting that these sites are not essential for the anticonvulsant actions of dimemorfan. Kainate (KA) administration (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) produced robust convulsions lasting 4-6 h in rats. Pre-treatment with dimemorfan (12 or 24 mg kg(-1)) reduced seizures in a dose-dependent manner. Dimemorfan pre-treatment also attenuated the KA-induced increases in c-fos/c-jun expression, activator protein (AP)-1 DNA-binding activity, and loss of cells in the CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus. These effects of dimemorfan were comparable to those of dextromethorphan. The anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or dimemorfan was significantly counteracted by a selective sigma1 receptor antagonist BD 1047, suggesting that the anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or dimemorfan is, at least in part, related to sigma1 receptor-activated modulation of AP-1 transcription factors. We asked whether dimemorfan produces the behavioral side effects seen with dextromethorphan or dextrorphan (a phencyclidine-like metabolite of dextromethorphan). Conditioned place preference and circling behaviors were significantly increased in mice treated with phencyclidine, dextrorphan or dextromethorphan, while mice treated with dimemorfan showed no behavioral side effects. Our results suggest that dimemorfan is equipotent to dextromethorphan in preventing KA-induced seizures, while it may lack behavioral effects, such as psychotomimetic reactions.
Two phase III studies revealed an oral UFT/Leucovorin (LV) regimen, in which the drugs are taken for 28 consecutive days every 35 days, which proved to be equivalent to an infusional 5-fluorouracil/LV regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The weekday-on/weekend-off schedule for UFT, which is taken for 5 consecutive days followed by 2 drug-free days,has been reported to be safe and to have good feasibility. In the present study, we investigated the weekday-on/weekend-off schedule for UFT/LV in 54 patients with CRC. The median administration period was 8 months. Ten patients (19%) showed grade 2 or more severe adverse reactions. One of them had grade 3 diarrhea and anorexia. Grade 2 anemia was observed in 9 cases (19%) and grade 2 leucopenia was in 2 cases (4%). Myelotoxicity was mild. These results suggested that the adverse reactions in the weekday-on/weekend-off schedule for UFT/LV are less severe than the conventional UFT/LV schedule reported previously. Antitumor effects and survival benefits of the two schedules should be evaluated by a phase III study.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including sulindac, have been shown to exhibit anti-colon cancer activity; however, the detailed mechanisms concerning continuous long-term administration are still unclear. Therefore, we examined the anti-colon carcinogenesis effects of sulindac after prolonged administration.
Administration of AOM, a colon-specific carcinogen, induced colonic preneoplastic lesions, which can progress to carcinomas about 40-50 weeks after AOM administration. We studied the effects of sulindac on the incidence of preneoplastic lesions, proliferative activity of colonic cells (AgNORs), tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene expression, and apoptosis using AOM-treated rat colon mucosa at 4 weeks and 40 weeks (early and late stage of colon carcinogenesis, respectively).
Sulindac suppressed the development of preneoplastic lesions induced by AOM at 4 weeks and 40 weeks by about 50% ( P<0.01); the proliferative activity of colonic cells increased by AOM was suppressed almost completely. Furthermore, APC expression was significantly increased by sulindac at both the early and late stages ( P<0.01). However, apoptosis was clearly increased at the early stage ( P<0.01), but not at the late stage.
APC overexpression induced by sulindac can suppress colon carcinogenesis at both the early and late stages, but apoptosis might work as one of anti-cancer mechanisms at the early stage of colon carcinogenesis.
Dapsone is widely used in dermatological practice. The case of a Greek female patient is reported who had a severe, acute, haemolytic episode shortly after commencing dapsone therapy, despite a normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) screening test. A subsequent quantitative assay revealed reduced levels of G6PD consistent with the heterozygous state. This illustrates that routine screening tests may fail to detect the decreased levels of (G6PD) which occur in female heterozygotes. Since these patients are at risk of severe dapsone-induced haemolysis, the need for quantitative G6PD assays in females from susceptible racial groups is emphasized.
To study formaldehyde concentrations in the breathing zone and symptoms induced by gaseous formaldehyde exposure of medical students and instructors during gross anatomy laboratory at faculty of Medicine, Thammasat university. Formaldehyde concentrations in the indoor air and breathing zone of medical students were measured during the cadaver dissection. Formaldehyde concentrations in the indoor air and in the breathing zone were ranged from 0.401 to 0.581 ppm (mean 0.491 +/- 0.090) and from 0.472 to 0.848 ppm (mean 0.660 +/- 0.188) respectively. The mean of formaldehyde concentrations in the breathing zone of medical students and instructors was significantly higher than the mean of formaldehyde concentration in indoor air (p < 0.05). The most symptoms were general fatigue (82.7-87.8%), burning eyes (66.2-85.0%) and burning nose (62.5-81.1%). There was no statistically significant difference in burning eye symptom between contact lenses users and no contact lenses users (p > 0.05). Even though formaldehyde concentrations were relatively low, medical students, instructors and cadaver related workers should wear personal protective devices to reduce the effect of gaseous formaldehyde exposure during gross anatomy laboratory or contact cadaver.
