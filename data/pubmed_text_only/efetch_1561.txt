The dopamine transporter (DAT) plays a key role in the regulation of dopaminergic signaling wherein it controls both the spatial and temporal actions of dopamine. Here we evaluated the behavioral and neurochemical consequences of increased DAT function by generating DAT transgenic mice (DAT-tg) that overexpress the transporter. These mice were generated by pronuclear injection of a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the mouse DAT locus, yielding an anatomical expression pattern of DAT-tg identical to WT. In DAT-tg mice there is a 3-fold increase in the levels of total and membrane-expressed DAT, but synaptic plasma membrane fractions of DAT-tg mice show only a 30% increase in transporter levels. Functional studies reveal that in the DAT-tg animals there is a 50% increase in the rate of dopamine (DA) uptake resulting in extracellular levels of DA that are decreased by approximately 40%. Behaviorally, DAT-tg animals display similar locomotor stimulation when treated with DAT blockers such as GBR12909, methylphenidate, and cocaine. However, these mice demonstrate markedly increased locomotor responses to amphetamine compared with WT animals. Furthermore, compared with controls, there is a 3-fold greater increase in the amount of DA released by amphetamine in DAT-tg mice that correlates with the 3-fold increase in protein expression. Finally, DAT-tg animals show reduced operant responding for natural reward while displaying preference for amphetamine at much lower doses (0.2 and 0.5 mg/kg) than WT mice (2 mg/kg). These results suggest that overexpression of DAT leads to a marked increase in sensitivity to psychomotor and rewarding properties of amphetamine.
We examined the analgesic effects of orally administered clonidine on pain induced by injection of propofol (Diprivan; 2,6-diisopropyl phenol). Female patients (n=81) were randomly allocated to one of two groups: oral clonidine (5.5 microg kg(-1)) followed by i.v. propofol and a control group given placebo followed by i.v. propofol. The median pain score in the group receiving clonidine, using a four-point scale (0=no pain, 1=minimal pain, 2=moderate pain, 3=severe pain) was 1 (0-2), significantly lower than in the control group [2 (1-3), median (25-75 percentiles), P<0.001].
A 1-month-old infant suffered cardiac arrest shortly after presentation to the emergency department. The child had a history of heart disease treated with digoxin. The infant died despite intensive resuscitative efforts, including the use of digoxin-specific Fab antibodies. A brief discussion of this case and the use of digoxin-specific antibodies is presented.
We report a patient with hypnic headache syndrome associated with excessive periodic limb movements in sleep, which is a unique finding for this syndrome recorded in polysomnography. She had had daily hypnic headache attacks history for 10 years. Her headache attacks ceased immediately after lithium carbonate therapy and she has been headache-free for 5 months.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic component and environmental risk factors. Nitric oxide (NO), which is produced by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), may play a role in the development of ASD. We genotyped nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NOS-I gene and nine SNPs in the NOS-IIA gene and carried out the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype analysis in 151 Korean ASD trios. We found preferential transmission of the A allele of rs8068149 (P = 0.039) and G allele of rs1060826 (P = 0.035) of NOS-IIA in ASD and the haplotype analysis revealed that the two haplotypes had significant associations (P = 0.014 and 0.031, respectively). The behavioral subdomain score of failure to use nonverbal behaviors to regulate social interaction in Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) was significantly higher in subjects with the GG or AG allele in rs1060826 of NOS-IIA compared to those who had the AA allele (P = 0.027). These results provide significant but weak evidence for an association between NOS-IIA and ASD in the Korean population.
We have previously shown that, after peripheral administration, different cytokines affect cognitive functions in mice. In this study, we evaluated the effects of mouse interleukin-6 (IL-6) on the classical behavioural test of scopolamine-induced amnesia for a passive avoidance response in the mouse. Pretraining i.p. administration of this cytokine (0.125 and 0.5 microgram/mouse) significantly reduced the amnesic action of the muscarinic receptor antagonist. As it is well known that brain amino acids are deeply involved in the modulation of cognitive processes we measured the levels of glutamine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and GABA in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of mice treated with IL-6. At both doses which affected the cognitive functions, this cytokine had no effect on brain levels of measured amino acids. Neither nociceptive thresholds to a thermal stimulus, nor spontaneous locomotor activity were modified by the acute administration of IL-6 (0.5 microgram/mouse). Our data confirm previous observations indicating that peripheral administration of cytokines affects some, but not other brain functions and suggest the involvement of IL-6 in the central modifications induced by the immune activation.
In healthy human volunteers, we have previously shown that isradipine, a dihydropyridine-class calcium-channel antagonist, reduces some methamphetamine-induced positive subjective effects associated with its abuse liability, presumably by antagonizing cortico-mesolimbic dopamine pathways. In the present study, we combined acute immediate-release (IR) isradipine with repeated sustained-release (SR) isradipine pretreatment to determine whether isradipine could antagonize methamphetamine's positive subjective and reinforcing effects in methamphetamine-dependent research subjects. We included 18 non-treatment-seeking, methamphetamine-dependent subjects aged between 18 and 51 years in this double-blind, within-subject, cross-over study, which was done in a human laboratory. Intravenous methamphetamine (0, 15 and 30 mg) was administered on three different days after 5 days of double-blind cross-over treatment with either isradipine or matching placebo. Subjects received oral isradipine 30 mg SR at bedtime, plus 15 mg IR administered 2 h before methamphetamine infusion. Self-report questionnaires measured drug liking, euphoria, craving, stimulation, and methamphetamine preference. Methamphetamine reinforcement was measured by a behavioural procedure involving choices between methamphetamine and money. For those who received isradipine second and placebo first as the pretreatment paradigm but not vice versa, methamphetamine-induced drug liking, elation, and preference were reduced significantly by isradipine. Depending upon conditioning status, isradipine can reduce some methamphetamine-induced positive subjective and reinforcing effects associated with its abuse liability in methamphetamine addicts.
Punding, complex stereotyped behavior, sometimes occurs in patients with Parkinson's disease under dopaminergic replacement therapy. Reduction of dopaminergic drugs may reduce the problem but risks enhancing motor impairment. We report a patient with Parkinson's disease presenting disabling punding, which was reversed by amantadine without aggravating motor function. Amantadine may reduce punding by blocking NMDA receptors, in the same manner as in levodopa-induced dyskinesias.
In the course of the last few years, various studies have researched the relations linking melatonin (MLT) with hematopoiesis and the immune-hematopoietic system. Nevertheless, to date there are numerous issues still opened and many questions are yet unanswered. Much emphasis has been recently placed on the reducing role of MLT, which has been demonstrated by many studies to mitigate the genotoxic damage inflicted by various alkylating agents. Although in vitro MLT has shown to be effective in limiting the cytological alterations provoked by chemotherapeutic drugs, some clinical studies seem to point to a somewhat lower effectiveness in countering chemotherapy-induced leukopenia and anemia.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity exerted by pharmacological doses of MLT in limiting leukopenia, anemia and other hemocytometric modifications in animals facing acute toxicity caused by the treatment with cyclophosphamide (CP). Moreover, we have compared the activity of MLT with well-known alpha-tocopherol/ascorbic acid antioxidant system.
Our results indicate that overall MLT exerts a remarkable countering activity towards leukopenia and anemia in the early phase of administration of CP.
Our findings suggest possible active involvement of MLT in hematopoiesis and erythrocyte- and leukocyte turnover. This paper summarizes the essential aspects of the available literature, researching the possible relations between MLT and immune-hematopoietic system.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of antenatal magnesium sulfate prevents adverse outcomes (neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leucomalacia, death, and cerebral palsy).
In a controlled trial, we randomized mothers in preterm labor to magnesium sulfate, "other" tocolytic, or placebo. At delivery, umbilical cord blood was collected for the later determination of serum ionized magnesium levels. Neonatal cranial ultrasound scans were obtained periodically for the diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leucomalacia. Among survivors, the diagnosis of cerebral palsy was made at age 18 months.
Children with adverse outcomes had higher umbilical cord magnesium levels at delivery. In regression models that controlled for confounders, which included very low birth weight, magnesium remained a significant risk factor (adjusted odds ratio, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-11.9; P =.03).
Contrary to original hypotheses, this randomized trial found that the use of antenatal magnesium sulfate was associated with worse, not better, perinatal outcome in a dose-response fashion.
Oxidative stress increases delayed neuronal death in the brain following ischemia. As a consequence, many attempts to reduce the damage resulting from cerebral ischemia under more highly oxidized conditions have focused on treatments aimed at maintaining the redox equilibrium of the local environment. This study demonstrates the synergistic effects of combining treatments with alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and vitamin E (VE) as an efficient measure to reduce the damage caused by cerebral ischemia. Two oral therapeutic protocols were examined: intensive treatment (100 mg/kg LA and 140 mg/kg VE for 7 days after ischemia) and prophylactic treatment (20 mg/kg LA and 50 mg/kg VE from 30 days before infarction up to the day of sacrifice). The prophylactic treatment reduced serum lipid peroxidation, and diminished brain infarct volume by approximately 50%. Furthermore, prophylactically treated rats showed a reduction in post-ischemia neurological scores. No significant differences were found in the intensively treated group. Our data indicate that pre-ischemia administration of the LA-VE antioxidant mixture reduced the volume of brain damaged and the functional consequences of embolic infarction. These findings suggest that prophylaxis with an LA-VE mixture may be valuable in reducing cerebral damage levels in patients with a high risk of stroke.
We report germline missense mutations in ETV6 segregating with the dominant transmission of thrombocytopenia and hematologic malignancy in three unrelated kindreds, defining a new hereditary syndrome featuring thrombocytopenia with susceptibility to diverse hematologic neoplasms. Two variants, p.Arg369Gln and p.Arg399Cys, reside in the highly conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. The third variant, p.Pro214Leu, lies within the internal linker domain, which regulates DNA binding. These three amino acid sites correspond to hotspots for recurrent somatic mutation in malignancies. Functional studies show that the mutations abrogate DNA binding, alter subcellular localization, decrease transcriptional repression in a dominant-negative fashion and impair hematopoiesis. These familial genetic studies identify a central role for ETV6 in hematopoiesis and malignant transformation. The identification of germline predisposition to cytopenias and cancer informs the diagnosis and medical management of at-risk individuals.
Although adverse drug reactions are a well-recognized cause of mental status changes in the elderly, antimicrobials are rarely implicated. Three patients with serious organic brain disease developed paranoid psychosis after therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin was begun. One of the patients was accidently rechallenged and again developed a psychotic reaction. The acute psychoses did not improve with moderate doses of major tranquilizers but resolved completely with drug discontinuation.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 12 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) susceptibility alleles. The pattern of association at these loci is consistent in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers who are at high risk of EOC. After imputation to 1000 Genomes Project data, we assessed associations of 11 million genetic variants with EOC risk from 15,437 cases unselected for family history and 30,845 controls and from 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 8,211 BRCA2 mutation carriers (3,096 with ovarian cancer), and we combined the results in a meta-analysis. This new study design yielded increased statistical power, leading to the discovery of six new EOC susceptibility loci. Variants at 1p36 (nearest gene, WNT4), 4q26 (SYNPO2), 9q34.2 (ABO) and 17q11.2 (ATAD5) were associated with EOC risk, and at 1p34.3 (RSPO1) and 6p22.1 (GPX6) variants were specifically associated with the serous EOC subtype, all with P < 5 × 10(-8). Incorporating these variants into risk assessment tools will improve clinical risk predictions for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.
Secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) are known to promote colorectal cancer (CRC). Increasing evidence suggests that DCA-induced signaling is mediated by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We have shown that activation of the EGFR induces up-regulation of cyclooxygenase 2, basolateral release of prostaglandins (PGs), and mitogenesis in a polarizing human colon cancer cell line, HCA-7. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism by which DCA activates EGFR in human polarizing CRC cell lines HCA-7 and HCT-8.
A primary, non-tumor-promoting bile acid (cholic acid [CA]) and a secondary, tumor-promoting bile acid, DCA, were added to the apical and basolateral compartment of polarized HCA-7 and HCT-8 cells. These cells were pretreated with monoclonal antibody 528, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits ligand binding to EGFR, or with WAY-022, a selective inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme/a disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 (TACE/ADAM-17), which cleaves amphiregulin (AR) to its mature, soluble form from the basolateral cell membrane. AR levels were measured in the apical and basolateral medium and cell lysates by radioimmunoassay. PGs were measured in the apical and basolateral medium by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
Basolateral delivery of DCA, but not CA, preferentially stimulated release of AR into the basolateral medium compared with cell lysates of polarized HCA-7 and HCT-8 cells. Basolateral delivery of DCA resulted in increased basolateral PGE2 levels (P < .05), and this effect was attenuated by pretreatment with monoclonal antibody 528 (P < .05). Inhibiting cell surface cleavage of AR with WAY-022 before DCA treatment reduced AR (P < .05) and PGE2 (P < .05) levels in the basolateral medium.
DCA, but not CA, results in compartment-specific, ligand-dependent activation of EGFR and subsequent increased basolateral PGE2 levels. The mechanism of DCA-induced EGFR activation is ligand-dependent and is controlled, at least in part, at the level of AR release from the basolateral cell membrane.
The involvement of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent neurons has been investigated in a rat model of cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis. CYP (150 mg/kg i.p., 48 h before) was administered in both vehicle- and capsaicin-(50 mg/kg s.c., 4 days before)-treated rats. Some experiments were performed 96 h after bilateral removal of pelvic ganglia (bladder denervation). CYP produced a marked detrusor hyperreflexia which was abolished by capsaicin pretreatment. CYP produced a marked increase in bladder weight and plasma protein extravasation (PPE, measured by Evans blue leakage technique): CYP-induced PPE was reduced by bladder denervation and was aggravated by capsaicin pretreatment. PPE aggravation by capsaicin was abolished by ganglionectomy. The bladder content of calcitonin gene-related peptide, was unaffected CYP. We conclude that CYP-induced decrease in bladder capacity is entirely mediated through stimulation of capsaicin-sensitive bladder afferents. At the time chosen as end point in these experiments, capsaicin-sensitive afferents exert an antiinflammatory influence on CYP-induced cystitis.
Capsaicin applied to human skin provokes a response known as neurogenic inflammation. Neuropeptides (substance P, CGRP), released from afferent C-fiber terminals and histamine, secondarily released from mast cells, are supposed to participate in this reaction. We investigated the contribution of arachidonic acid and metabolic products to neurogenic inflammation, using a potent topically applied glucocorticoid and the corresponding vehicle. Arachidonic acid is liberated from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2, an enzyme that can be blocked by glucocorticoids. In 12 healthy volunteers, neurogenic inflammation was induced by capsaicin 1% on both upper forearms after 16 h of topical pretreatment with either prednicarbate or vehicle. Neurogenic inflammation was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry and by planimetry of flare sizes. Prednicarbate significantly reduced the laser Doppler flow values inside the flare responses, as well as the flare sizes themselves. These results show that to some extent glucocorticoids reduce capsaicin-induced neurogenic inflammation.
A leprosy patient who developed acute renal failure on multidrug therapy is reported. The patient had initially received a once-weekly dose of rifampin and after he had stopped taking the drug for a time, was given rifampin on a once-monthly dose schedule. He recovered completely from his acute renal failure. Kidney biopsy showed interstitial nephritis with mononuclear and eosinophilic cellular infiltrates.
To date, the event free survival (EFS) after treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) attains 80%. The survivor group is growing steadily. Therefore, the primary purpose of our study is to define the neuropsychological function and to describe which central nervous system (CNS) functions are impaired following the German ALL-BFM and COALL protocols for CNS-negative patients.
In a cross-sectional multicenter study 121 subjects, long-term survivors of childhood ALL in first continuous complete remission were investigated. Seven years ago, the subjects were treated as standard or medium risk patients according to ALL-BFM 81, ALL-BFM 83, or COALL 82 protocols, receiving comparable treatments. According to different CNS-prophylaxes, two subgroups were compared in the study: the non-cranially irradiated MTX-group (methotrexate-group) (n = 38) and the cranially irradiated RT-group (radiotherapy-group) (with MTX i.th.) (n = 83). Intellectual and cognitive abilities of these groups were evaluated using standardized psychometric techniques. The Kaufman factors Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organisation and Freedom from Distractibility were calculated. Demographical and clinical data collected at the time of the diagnosis were compared between both groups. The different prognoses for patients within both groups were taken into account using a defined risk factor. Analysis of variance was conducted to relate intellectual performance to age, gender, and CNS-treatment.
The RT-group exhibited a lower Full Scale IQ than the MTX-group (101.2 +/- 15.9 vs. 109.9 +/- 14.9, P = 0.031). Particularly for the Kaufman factor Freedom from Distractibility the RT-group showed the lower scores (96.9 +/- 14.1 vs. 105.5 +/- 12.6, P = 0.037). Significant interactions between gender and CNS prophylactic treatment were observed for Full Scale IQ (P = 0.008), Verbal IQ (P = 0.012), Performance IQ (P = 0.024), Verbal Comprehension (P = 0.004), and Perceptual Organisation (P = 0.032).
Cranial irradiation in combination with MTX therapy was associated with deficits in attention, concentration, and the ability of sequencing and processing, measured by the Kaufman factor Freedom from Distractibility. Our results support the strategy of avoiding prophylactic CNS irradiation in low risk patients.
The only drugs which commonly cause diabetes during therapeutic use are the anti-hypertensive vasodilator diazoxide, and corticosteroids in high doses such as those used to palliate intracranial tumours. Thiazide diuretics have in the past been used in higher doses than necessary to treat hypertension, and the lower doses now used probably carry only a slight risk of inducing diabetes. The risk from beta-blockers is also quite small, but there is some evidence that thiazides combined with beta-blockers may be more likely to cause diabetes than either drug alone. The combination is probably best avoided in patients with a family history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The effect of the low-oestrogen combined oral contraceptive pill seems to be slight, and it presents a risk only to women who have had gestational diabetes. Bodybuilders who take enormous doses of anabolic-androgens can develop impaired glucose tolerance. Several drugs, including theophylline, aspirin, isoniazid and nalidixic acid can cause transient hyperglycaemia in overdosage, but only streptozotocin, alloxan and the rodenticide Vacor are likely to cause permanent diabetes.
A Phase II study of CPT-11 in adults with recurrent, temozolomide (TMZ)-refractory, 1p19q co-deleted, anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) with a primary objective of determining 6-month progression free survival (PFS).
There is no standard therapy for alkylator-resistant AO.
Twenty-two patients (11 men; 11 women) ages 26-65 (median 40), with radiographically recurrent AO were enrolled. All patients had previously been treated with surgery, involved-field radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy (TMZ in 15; BCNU in 6). Fifteen patients were treated at first recurrence with an alternative chemotherapy. 13 patients underwent repeat surgery. All patients were treated at either first or second recurrence with CPT-11 administered intravenously once every 3 weeks. Neurological and neuroradiographic evaluations were performed every 8-9 weeks.
All patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. A total of 141 cycles of CPT-11 (median 3 cycles; range 3-18) were administered. CPT-11 related toxicity included diarrhea (14 patients; 4 grade 3), neutropenia (8; 4 grade 3), fatigue (12; 3 grade 3), and delayed nausea/vomiting (12; 3 grade 3). 5 patients (23%) demonstrated a partial radiographic response, 8 (36%) demonstrated stable disease and 9 (41%) had progressive disease following three cycles of CPT-11. Time to tumor progression ranged from 2 to 13.5 months (median: 4.5 months). Survival ranged from 3 to 21 months (median: 5.5 months). Six-month and 12-month PFS were 33% and 4.5% respectively.
CPT-11 demonstrated modest efficacy (similar to other salvage glioma regimens) with acceptable toxicity in this cohort of adults with recurrent, 1p19q co-deleted AO all of whom had failed prior TMZ chemotherapy.
Although systemic heparinisation is routine during CEA, reversal with protamine is controversial with 3 studies suggesting increased peri-operative stroke rates and 3 no effect. None included independent peer-review.
Non-randomised observational study of data derived from a randomised controlled study of anaesthetic technique for CEA.
Data on heparin and protamine use and risk factors potentially influencing CEA outcome were collected prospectively. Stroke, death, MI, wound haematoma and re-operation rates were recorded following independent peer-review.
1513/2107 patients received heparin alone (H) and 594/2107 had heparin reversed with protamine (H+P). Risk factors for outcome were similar in both groups. The frequency of outcome events (H v H+P) were: stroke: 67/1513 (4.4%) v 17/594 (2.9%), p=0.098; non stroke or MI death: 10/1513 (0.7%) v 5/594 (0.8%), p=0.657; MI: 6/1513 (0.4%) v 3/594 (0.5%), p=0.718; haematoma: 157/1513 (10.4%) v 44/594 (7.4%), p=0.037; re-operation: 51/1380 (3.7%) v 18/565 (3.2%), p=0.581.
These results show a non-significant increase in stroke rate in patients receiving heparin alone refuting suggestions that protamine is harmful. Conversely post-operative haematoma was more frequent when protamine was withheld but re-operation rates were no different. Thus protamine use appears safe and should remain a matter for individual surgeon preference.
Docetaxel, a taxane derivative, is frequently used for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and metastatic prostate cancer. Clinical reports demonstrated that docetaxel-based chemotherapy often induces anorexia, but the etiology is not completely understood. To elucidate possible mechanisms, we investigated the involvement of central interleukin (IL)-1β, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the development of docetaxel-induced anorexia in rats. Rats received docetaxel (10mg/kg, i.p.) with or without pretreatment with selective COX-2 inhibitors, NS-398 (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.g.) or celecoxib (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.g.), and a non-selective COX inhibitor, indomethacin (10mg/kg, i.g.), then food intake was monitored for 24h after administration. We also examined expression of IL-1β, COX-2, and POMC mRNA in hypothalamus of docetaxel-treated rats and the effect of a COX-2 inhibitor on docetaxel-induced POMC mRNA expression. Food consumption in rats was significantly decreased 24h after administration of docetaxel and anorexia was partially reversed by all COX inhibitors. Administration of docetaxel increased IL-1β, COX-2, and POMC mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of rats. The time required to increase these gene expressions was comparable to the latency period of docetaxel-induced anorexia in rats. In addition, pretreatment with COX-2 inhibitors suppressed docetaxel-induced expression of POMC mRNA. These results suggest that IL-1β and COX-2 mRNA expression and subsequent activation of POMC in the hypothalamus may contribute to the development of docetaxel-induced anorexia in rats.
Indomethacin and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) augmented amphetamine and apomorphine-induced stereotypies. In contrast, PGE1 and PGE2 decreased the stereotypies in rats, while PGF2 alpha enhanced amphetamine-induced stereotypy. Indomethacin given in combination with the peptides did not change their effect, whereas prostaglandins diminished the stimulatory effect of FDP on the amphetamine or apomorphine-induced stereotypy. Indomethacin and studied prostaglandins did not influence inhibitory action of FDP on haloperidol-induced catalepsy. It is concluded that prostaglandins do not play any essential role in the interaction of FDP with dopaminergic system in the CNS.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate oral methotrexate tablets in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy.
Patients with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy were offered oral methotrexate tablets rather that intramuscular injection. Oral methotrexate was given in 2 divided doses 2 hours apart at a dose of 60 mg/m(2) with standard 2.5 mg methotrexate tablets. Patients were followed up with the use of the same protocol that was used typically for intramuscular methotrexate.
Nineteen of 22 patients (86%) were successfully treated. There was no statistical difference between patients who were treated successfully or unsuccessfully, with respect to initial human chorionic gonadotropin titers (P =.55), ectopic size (P =.77), or methotrexate dose (P =.18). Nineteen of 22 patients (86%) had increased pain during treatment. Outside of pain, gastrointestinal side effects were the most common. Thirty-two percent of patients required more than one treatment cycle.
Oral methotrexate can be used to treat ectopic pregnancy successfully, but there are few advantages to recommend its use over intramuscular methotrexate.
