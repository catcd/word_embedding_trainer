The world medical literature contains 43 reports of deaths associated with amphetamines in a 35-year period. These included seven cerebrovascular accidents, six sudden cardiac deaths, three cases of hyperpyrexia, eight poisonings of uncertain mechanism and seven cases of medical complications of intravenous injection; the remainder were of uncertain cause. In contrast, in Ontario alone, in 1972 and 1973 there were 26 deaths in amphetamine users, of which 16 were due to accident suicide or homicide. Of the remaining cases, two were cardiac, two hepatic and the rest were mixed drug overdose. Pulmonary granulomata, subacute hepatitis and other lesions resulting from intravenous drug use were common findings at autopsy. On the basis of the estimated number of regular users of intravenous amphetamine in Ontario, the mortality rate in such users is at least four times as high as in the general population of the same age, and is comparable to that in alcoholics and heroin addicts. However, the absolute number of alcohol-related deaths is far greater than the number of deaths in amphetamine or heroin users.
Breast cancer treatment with mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) is associated with intense pain in the primary post-operative period. The present prospective, placebo-controlled and double-blind study aimed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of diclofenac, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), in combination with paracetamol and opioids. This was done by 64-h assessment of post-operative pain intensity, opioid consumption, blood loss, nausea and tiredness.
Fifty women selected for mastectomy and IBR with submuscular implants with or without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were randomized to receive diclofenac 50 mg x 3 or placebo rectally in addition to oral paracetamol and intravenous opioids delivered using a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) technique.
During the first 20 h post-surgery, patients who received diclofenac experienced significantly less pain when resting than those who received placebo. When moving, a non-significant estimated difference in pain in favour of diclofenac was also noted. Opioid consumption during the first 6 h post-operatively was 34% less with diclofenac than with placebo. Means (SD) were 16.9 (10.3) mg and 25.6 (10.2) mg, respectively (P = 0.007). After 64 h, the difference was no longer statistically significant. Post-operative bleeding was significantly higher with diclofenac than with placebo (P < 0.01). Nausea and tiredness did not differ between the groups.
The addition of NSAID to paracetamol and opioid-PCA reduced opioid consumption and improved pain relief during the first 20 h at rest but was not convincingly effective during mobilization. Post-operative blood loss was higher with diclofenac.
Morphine co-injection has anti-inflammatory effects on zymosan-induced peritonitis in several strains of mice except that of CBA. As peritoneal mast cells (pMCs) are much more numerous in CBA mice than in SWISS mice, therole of pMCs in morphine-modulated zymosan peritonitis is compared in CBA and SWISS males.
pMCs were treated in vitro with morphine or C48/80 for comparison of histamine release. In vivo accumulation of leukocytes and histamine in peritoneal exudate were recorded after intraperitoneal injection with morphine, zymosan, or zymosan plus morphine.
Morphine induces histamine release by pMCs from CBA mice but not SWISS mice. In vivo morphine-induced peritonitis is stronger in CBA mice than SWISS mice. Corollary, morphine anti-inflammatory effects on zymosan peritonitis are reversed in CBA mice by its pro-inflammatory action through CBA pMCs.
Although methotrexate has an established safety profile in clinical practice, severe morbidity can still occur on rare occasions. We report two patients with leukemia treated with high dose methotrexate. Both patients developed profound polyuria that required aggressive fluid resuscitations during the treatments. Renal toxicity is a known complication of methotrexate, but polyuria associated with its use has not been reported before. Polyuria started shortly after the initiation of the medicine in both patients. The polyuria resolved as the drug level in blood became undetectable. The episodes of polyuria were transient and recurred every time when the patients received methotrexate. The clinical pictures were not compatible with classical drug induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. It is possible that the drug interferes with adenosine metabolism, which in turn alters the tubular ability of solute and fluid reabsorption.
The present study was undertaken to evaluate the preventive role of naringin on mitochondrial lipid peroxides, antioxidants and lipids in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in male Wistar rats. Rats subcutaneously injected with ISO (85 mg/kg) at an interval of 24 h for 2 days resulted in a significant increase in the levels of mitochondrial lipid peroxides with a significant decrease in the activities/levels of mitochondrial antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and reduced glutathione). ISO-induction also showed a significant increase in the levels of mitochondrial cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty acids with a subsequent decrease in the levels of phospholipids. Oral pretreatment with naringin (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) to ISO-induced rats daily for a period of 56 days significantly decreased the levels of mitochondrial lipid peroxides with a significant increase in the activities/levels of mitochondrial antioxidants and significantly minimized the alterations in the mitochondrial lipid levels in ISO-induced rats. Thus, the findings demonstrate that naringin prevents alterations in mitochondrial lipid peroxides, antioxidants and lipids in ISO-induced MI in rats.
Overexposure to manganese (Mn) has been known to induce neuronal damage involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, the exact mechanism of Mn-induced ER stress is unclear. Increasing evidence suggested that the overexpression of alpha-synuclein played a critical role in Mn-induced neurotoxicity. To explore whether the occurrence of ER stress was associated with alpha-synuclein overexpression, we made the rat brain slices model of silencing alpha-synuclein using short-interference RNA. After non-silencing alpha-synuclein slices were treated with Mn (0-400 μM) for 24 h, there was a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic rates of cells and levels of lactate dehydrogenase in the culture medium. Moreover, there was a dose-dependent increase in the protein expression of 78, 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78/94), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and caspase-12. Moreover, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) phosphorylation, PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2a, and ATF4 expression also increased. Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) activation and X-box-binding protein-1 (Xbp1) mRNA splicing increased. Activating transcription factor 6 p90 levels did not change. However, after silencing alpha-synuclein slices were treated with 400 μM Mn for 24 h, there was a significant decrease in the expression of GRP78/94, CHOP, and caspase-12 compared with 400 μM Mn-treated non-silencing alpha-synuclein slices. Furthermore, PERK phosphorylation, PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2a, and ATF4 mRNA expression also decreased. However, IRE1 phosphorylation and Xbp1 mRNA splicing did not change. The findings revealed that Mn induced ER stress via activation of PERK and IRE1 signaling pathways and subsequent apoptosis in cultured slices. Moreover, alpha-synuclein protein was associated with Mn-induced activation of PERK signaling pathway.
We identified two mutations in the CYP19 gene responsible for aromatase deficiency in an 18-year-old 46,XX female with ambiguous external genitalia at birth, primary amenorrhea and sexual infantilism, and polycystic ovaries. The coding exons, namely exons II-X, of the CYP19 gene were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and sequenced directly. Direct sequencing of the amplified DNA from the patient revealed two single-base changes, at bp 1303 (C-->T) and bp 1310 (G-->A) in exon X, which were newly found missense mutations and resulted in codon changes of R435C and C437Y, respectively. Subcloning followed by sequencing confirmed that the patient is a compound heterozygote. The results of restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of the amplified exon X DNA from the patient's mother indicate maternal inheritance of the R435C mutation. Transient expression experiments showed that the R435C mutant protein had approximately 1.1% of the activity of the wild type, whereas C437Y was totally inactive. Cysteine-437 is the conserved cysteine in the heme-binding region believed to serve as the fifth coordinating ligand of the heme iron. To our knowledge, this patient is the first adult to have described the cardinal features of a syndrome of aromatase deficiency. Recognition that such defects exist will lead to a better understanding of the role of this enzyme in human development and disease.
Coumarin derivatives are the anticoagulants most widely used in the United States. These agents are relatively contraindicated during pregnancy, and the use of these drugs in breast-feeding women remains controversial. Much of the confusion regarding the passage of these agents into breast milk might stem from the fact that different agents possess significantly different chemical properties. A review of the chemical structure of different coumarin derivatives, as well as available clinical evidence, suggests that warfarin sodium is not excreted into breast milk, and can be safely given to women requiring therapeutic anticoagulation postpartum. For the rare patient who cannot tolerate warfarin sodium, the use of dicumarol, rather than anisindione, is preferred.
The changes in insulin-induced growth hormone secretion and in serum cortisol level were studied in 3 cases of West syndrome. The ACTH therapy consisted of an eight weeks course with gradual tapering every two weeks. Daily administration of 12.5 or 25.0 micrograms per kg ACTH for two weeks suppressed an insulin-induced rise in serum GH. The patients who showed sharply suppressed responses as to serum GH had been exposed to high cortisol levels of over 50 micrograms per dl serum. When they were examined before starting the therapy and 72 or 96 hours after the last ACTH injection, all the subjects showed a normal rise in the level of serum GH. The clinical implications of the findings were discussed in terms of the possible adverse effect on the developing brain.
The objective of this study is to present our preliminary experience with pulmonary hypertension inhaled nitric oxide therapy with two newborns presenting with transposition of the great arteries, as well as the usefulness of the Doppler in pulmonary hypertension diagnosis.
Revision of the variations of the hypoxic parameters according to the therapy and revision of the diagnostic procedures in both cases was carried out.
Nitric oxide therapy was followed by an evident improvement of the hypoxia and the patient's hemodynamic stabilization, which allowed surgical correction in optimal conditions. The ductal flow pattern allowed recognition of the presence of pulmonary hypertension.
Inhaled nitric oxide must be taken into account as a very useful option in the treatment of this kind of patient and the Doppler examination allows the evaluation of the presence of pulmonary hypertensions.
In an attempt to better understand the role of the cyclohexene ring (ring A) in the biochemical and pharmacological properties of anthracyclines related to doxorubicin and daunorubicin, we investigated the effects of introduction of a fluorine atom at position 8 of idarubicin (4-demethoxydaunorubicin) on drug molecular conformation and biochemical and pharmacological activities. The study showed that the stereochemistry of the substituent at position 8 influenced the "half-chair" conformation, so that in the (8R)-fluoroepimer the A ring retained the alpha half-chair conformation, which is the most stable for natural compounds (i.e., daunorubicin and doxorubicin), and the (8S)-fluoroepimers preferred the beta half-chair conformation. The (8R)-fluoroepimer was more effective than the (8S)-fluoroepimer and idarubicin in stimulating topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage. Similarly, the epimer with the alpha conformation was markedly more potent than the (8S)-epimer as a cytotoxic agent in a variety of human tumor cell lines and was more effective as an antitumor agent in the treatment of an ovarian carcinoma xenograft. In addition, 8-fluoro derivatives were able to overcome the resistance to doxorubicin in a number of human tumor cell lines expressing different mechanisms of resistance. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that drug interactions involving the external (nonintercalating) moiety of the anthracycline chromophore play an important role in determining pharmacological properties, including drug ability to induce DNA cleavage, and therefore their antitumor efficacy.
The incidence and severity of muscle pains were investigated in patients who had been given suxamethonium and thiopentone anesthesia for bronchoscopy. Group I patients received no other drugs. Groups II and III received d-tubocurarine and THA respectively before suxamethonium. Administration of these drugs resulted in a highly significant reduction in the incidence of severe and moderate pains. The use of d-tubocurarine necessitated a significantly greater amount of suxamethonium to maintain paralysis.
Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated an antagonistic hemodynamic interaction between ethanol and clonidine in conscious and in urethane-anesthetized rats. The present study tested the hypothesis that ethanol produces its effect by counteracting clonidine-evoked inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) release at its major site of action, the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). In vivo electrochemical measurement of real-time changes in NE level in the RVLM of urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats was made along with blood pressure and heart rate. Clonidine (30 microg/kg, i.v.) produced significant decreases (p < 0.05) in NE electrochemical signal and blood pressure. Ethanol (1 g/kg, i.v.) administered 10 min after clonidine significantly (p < 0.05) increased NE signal and counteracted clonidine-evoked hypotension. Equal volume of saline had no effect on NE signal in the RVLM nor on the hypotensive response to clonidine. Pretreatment with the same dose of ethanol (1 g/kg) caused slight increases in RVLM NE level and in blood pressure, but did not influence the electrochemical and blood pressure responses to clonidine; clonidine (30 microg/kg) administration 10 min after ethanol resulted in significant (p < 0.05) decreases in NE signal and blood pressure. These findings suggest that: (i) ethanol counteraction of the hypotensive action of clonidine involves, at least in part, opposite effects on central pathways that use NE as a neurotransmitter; (ii) the RVLM represents a possible site for the adverse hemodynamic interaction between ethanol and clonidine; and (iii) ethanol-evoked increase in RVLM NE, which correlates with its pressor effect, is much enhanced when RVLM NE level is reduced by clonidine.
Chronic ethanol consumption has deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system by directly damaging the myocardial structure and/or by neurohormonal activation. Moreover, nitric oxide (NO) derived from neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) seems to be important to balance the harmful effects of ethanol consumption, because it influences several aspects of cardiac physiology and attenuates pathological cardiac remodeling. However, the impact of chronic ethanol consumption on nNOS expression is unknown. We address this subject in the present study by evaluating whether chronic ethanol consumption induces cardiac remodeling and hypertension, and if these changes are associated with alterations in the expression of nNOS. Male Wistar rats were examined after ingesting a 20% alcohol solution for 6 months. Blood alcohol concentration and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were measured. The cardiac remodeling was assessed by histomorphometric analysis and the nNOS expression was evaluated by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. Our results show that chronic ethanol consumption induces cardiac remodeling, namely thinning of left ventricular wall, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased fibrosis, and elevations of arterial blood pressure. They also show that in rats fed with ethanol for 6 months, the circulating BNP levels had decreased as well as the expression of nNOS in left ventricle cardiomyocytes. These findings suggest that the effects of chronic ethanol consumption on BNP levels and/or on nNOS expression in cardiomyocytes may contribute to aggravate the cardiac remodeling and leads to progression of cardiomyopathy.
Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor of childhood. Significant proportions of these patients eventually develop pulmonary metastases and succumb to their disease even after conventional multi-agent chemotherapy and surgical excision. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 induced degradation of blood vessel basement membranes is an important pre-requisite for tumor invasion and metastasis. Bisphosphonates (BPs) have been known to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in some tumors such as breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer, and may do so through inhibition of MMP secretion. We, therefore, tested the effect of BPs on tumor cell invasion, MMP-2 secretion, and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cell lines.
Two osteosarcoma cell lines (SaOS-2, U(2)OS) were treated with alendronate (50, 100, and 150 microM) for 24 and 48 hr. Matrigel invasion assay was used to investigate the invasive potential of osteosarcoma cell lines before and after alendronate treatment. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the mRNA level of MMP-2 with and without alendronate treatment. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify the cytokine level of MMP-2 secreted in the condition medium. BP-induced cell apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescent flow cytometric analysis.
The results showed that alendronate inhibited cell invasion of both osteosarcoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Alendronate reduced the mRNA level and cellular level of MMP-2 in both cell lines in a time and dose-dependent manner. Alendronate also induced significant apoptosis in both cell lines. Our finding suggests that alendronate downregulates MMP-2 secretion and induces apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells, which may both contribute to the reduction of invasive potential of the tumor cells.
Coexistence of thyrotoxicosis and moyamoya disease is extremely rare. A 23-year-old woman who had a history of migraine, suffered from frequent right carotid transient ischemic attacks, followed by an ischemic stroke after taking ergotamine for migraine. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed a tubular stenosis of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and bilateral strictures of the supraclinoid segments of the ICAs. A concomitant thyrotoxicosis was found. A second stroke occurred three weeks later, when the dosage of antithyroid medication was increased and phenylpropanolamine-containing cold remedies were taken. Moyamoya disease was confirmed by cerebral angiography which showed irregular tubular stenosis of the right cervical ICA just above the bifurcation and nearly complete occlusion of bilateral supraclinoid ICAs with collateral flows from posterior circulation. The complexity of the cerebral hemodynamics of this patient is discussed.
Cardiac complications are exceptional in long-term chloroquine therapy; congestive heart failure and restrictive cardiomyopathy may develop, but disorders of conduction are more frequent. The characteristics of these disorders emerge from 12 cases in the literature and from 2 personal cases. The usual disorder is fascicular block which may become a complete, syncopal, atrioventricular block, as in one of our 2 patients. The time elapsed between the beginning of treatment and the occurrence of these disorders (2 to 30 years) and the total dose of chloroquine received (100 to 2,500 g) are extremely variable. Retinopathy or neuromyopathy is present in 64 and 35 percent of the cases respectively. The diagnosis is confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy with electron microscopic study which shows vaculoar myopathy with numerous large secondary lysosomes containing a dense material of lamellar structure (myelinic figures, curvilinear bodies). Regression of heart conduction disorders after withdrawal of chloroquine seems to be inconstant and incomplete. The rare occurrence of this complication raises the question of genetic predisposition. We believe that chloroquine therapy should be contra-indicated in patients with a history of conduction disorders and that a 6-monthly electrocardiographic control of these patients would be justified.
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has demonstrated effectiveness in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Therefore the FDA has approved it to treat APL. In patients with refractory metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC), we assessed the efficacy and toxicity of As2O3/AA (ascorbic acid) as the outcome of this trial. Five patients with refractory metastatic CRC who failed all previous standard chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. They were treated with 0.25 mg/kg body weight/day As2O3 and 1000 mg/day of ascorbic acid for 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Each treatment cycle extended for 7 weeks with 5 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of rest. All the patients developed moderate to severe toxic side effects to arsenic trioxide/AA therapy and therefore the study was discontinued. No CR (complete remission) or PR (partial remission) was observed. CT scans demonstrated stable or progressive disease. Three of the five patients died within 2 to 5 months after cessation of the therapy. None of the deaths could be related to this clinical trial. Two years of follow-up study showed that two patients were alive with stable disease. Under the current treatment regimen all patients developed moderate to severe side effects with no clinically measurable activity. As an alternate, efforts may be made to reduce the dose and arsenic trioxide may be combined with other standard regimen in reversing the chemo resistance.
We describe a 75-year-old man with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) with myeloperoxidase (MPO)-antineutrophil antibody (ANCA) and proteinase-3 (PR3)-ANCA. He had a slight fever and eruption with itching after taking cimetidine (prescribed after gastrectomy for gastric cancer) and he was admitted to a nearby hospital. There, he showed proteinuria, serum creatinine (sCr) of 2.9 mg/dl, and creatinine clearance (Ccr) of 44 ml/min per 1.73 m2. His MPO-ANCA titer was 267 EU, and PR3-ANCA titer was 112 EU. Abnormal concentrations in bilateral kidneys were found by gallium scintigraphy. For these reasons, he was transferred to our hospital. Percutaneous renal biopsy was performed after admission. Severe tubular atrophy, mild interstitial fibrosis, and severe mononuclear cell infiltration of the interstitium were noted. Drug-induced renal impairment was suspected, and cimetidine administration was withdrawn. Lymphocyte stimulation tests (DLSTs) were performed. The cimetidine titer was positive, at 2,537 cpm. After the withdrawal of cimetidine, the PR3-ANCA titer was reduced gradually, and, next, the MPO-ANCA titer was also reduced. The sCr level was reduced to 1.2 mg/dl. In summary, we report herein the first case of cimetidine-induced TIN associated with both MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCA.
The progression of pancreatic cancer is dependent on local tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. EFEMP1, a recently discovered member of the fibulin family, was characterized with regard to these key elements of pancreatic cancer progression. Differential gene expression was assessed by mRNA microarray hybridization in FG human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and L3.6pl cells, a highly metastatic variant of FG. In vivo orthotopic tumor growth of EFEMP1-transfected FG cells was examined in nude mice. To assess the angiogenic properties of EFEMP1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production of tumor cells, endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and tumor microvessel density were analyzed in response to EFEMP1. Further, tumor cell apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and resistance to cytotoxic agents were quantitated by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. In microarray hybridization, EFEMP1 was shown to be significantly up-regulated in L3.6pl cells compared with FG cells. Concordantly, EFEMP1 transfection of FG cells stimulated orthotopic and metastatic tumor growth in vivo. EFEMP1 expression resulted in a stimulation of VEGF production by tumor cells and an increased number of CD31-positive microvessels. Endothelial cell proliferation and migration were not altered by EFEMP1, indicating an indirect angiogenic effect. Further, EFEMP1 expression decreased apoptosis and promoted cell cycle progression in response to serum starvation or exposure to gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan. EFEMP1 has protumorigenic effects on pancreatic cancer in vivo and in vitro mediated by VEGF-driven angiogenesis and antiapoptotic mechanisms. Hence, EFEMP1 is a promising candidate for assessing prognosis and individualizing therapy in a clinical tumor setting.
Somatic mutations in noncoding sequences are poorly explored in cancer, a rare exception being the recent identification of activating mutations in TERT regulatory DNA. Although this finding is suggestive of a general mechanism for oncogene activation, this hypothesis remains untested. Here we map somatic mutations in 505 tumor genomes across 14 cancer types and systematically screen for associations between mutations in regulatory regions and RNA-level changes. We identify recurrent promoter mutations in several genes but find that TERT mutations are exceptional in showing a strong and genome-wide significant association with increased expression. Detailed analysis of TERT across cancers shows that the strength of this association is highly variable and is strongest in copy number-stable cancers such as thyroid carcinoma. We additionally propose that TERT promoter mutations control expression of the nearby gene CLPTM1L. Our analysis provides a detailed pan-cancer view of TERT transcriptional activation but finds no clear evidence for frequent oncogenic promoter mutations beyond TERT.
Despite the widespread use of oral anticoagulants derived from 4-hydroxycoumarin, there have been only a small number of well-defined cases of hepatotoxicity. We report a well-defined case of cholestasis following exposure to warfarin sodium (Coumadin). Inadvertent rechallenge reproduced the syndrome. Cholestasis may occur in response to exposure to derivations of 4-hydroxycoumarin.
The authors investigated the hemodynamic, metabolic, electroencephalographic (EEG), and electromyographic (EMG) characteristics of narcotic-induced rigidity during induction of anesthesia with alfentanil (175 micrograms/kg) in 10 patients. Thiopental (4 mg/kg) was administered to a ten-patient control group. Rigidity was quantified in eight muscle groups (sternocleidomastoid, deltoid, biceps, forearm flexors, intercostal, rectus abdominus, vastus medialis/lateralis, and gastrocnemius). Marked rigidity was observed in all muscle groups in all patients receiving alfentanil and in none receiving thiopental. Central venous pressure increased with onset of rigidity, while mean arterial pressure and cardiac index remained unchanged. Manual ventilation was extremely difficult during alfentanil-induced rigidity. Arterial oxygen tension decreased more rapidly during rigidity than during the same time interval in the control group, while patients experiencing rigidity were more acidotic, as reflected by greater increases in base deficit. The EEG demonstrated an anesthetic state without seizure activity. The immediate increase in central venous pressure with the onset of rigidity, along with occasional simultaneous parallel variations in central venous pressure and the EMG, strongly suggest a mechanical mechanism for the change in central venous pressure. The metabolic changes during rigidity may be partly related to the absence of the normal cardiovascular reflexes that are reported to occur during voluntary isometric muscle contractions. A neurochemical mechanism of narcotic-induced rigidity is briefly reviewed.
