In a pilot study of 6 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a ruptured intracranial (grade IV (Hunt and Hess) aneurysm the hemodynamics and plasma-nimodipine concentrations have been observed during a 3-week period of treatment. We found that 3 patients developed reversible hypotension during the nimodipine treatment and that the hypotension tendency could be related to the plasma-nimodipine level and not to a more or less severe sensitivity to nimodipine. Repeated measurements of blood pressure, plasma-nimodipine and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) are necessary for the purpose of obtaining the optimum treatment and for evaluating the effect of treatment.
This article describes two patients with major ischemic stroke symptoms who had extremely small areas of acute brain infarction, suggestive of acute intrahemispheric diaschisis. Both patients were using narcotic analgesics during their stroke, and in both cases the clinical deficits improved dramatically with naloxone.
We postulate that the narcotics amplified the ischemic stroke symptoms and that this effect was antagonized by naloxone.
This suggests that the opiate system may be involved in the process of intrahemispheric diaschisis.
Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin occurring naturally in a wide range of food commodities. In animals, it has been shown to cause a variety of adverse effects, nephrocarcinogenicity being the most prominent. Because of its high toxic potency and the continuous exposure of the human population, OTA has raised public health concerns. There is significant debate on how to use the rat carcinogenicity data to assess the potential risk to humans. In this context, the question of the mechanism of action of OTA appears of key importance and was studied through the application of a toxicogenomics approach. Male Fischer rats were fed OTA for up to 2 years. Renal tumors were discovered during the last 6 months of the study. The total tumor incidence reached 25% at the end of the study. Gene expression profile was analyzed in groups of animals taken in intervals from 7 days to 12 months. Tissue-specific responses were observed in kidney versus liver. For selected genes, microarray data were confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels. In kidney, several genes known as markers of kidney injury and cell regeneration were significantly modulated by OTA. The expression of genes known to be involved in DNA synthesis and repair, or genes induced as a result of DNA damage, was only marginally modulated. Very little or no effect was found amongst genes associated with apoptosis. Alterations of gene expression indicating effects on calcium homeostasis and a disruption of pathways regulated by the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4alpha) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were observed in the kidney but not in the liver. Previous data have suggested that a reduction in HNF4alpha may be associated with nephrocarcinogenicity. Many Nrf2-regulated genes are involved in chemical detoxication and antioxidant defense. The depletion of these genes is likely to impair the defense potential of the cells, resulting in chronic elevation of oxidative stress in the kidney. The inhibition of defense mechanism appears as a highly plausible new mechanism, which could contribute to OTA carcinogenicity.
In recent years the role of phenolic compounds and sesquiterpene lactones, particularly parthenolide, in the anti-migraine and anti-inflammatory effects of Tanacetum parthenium (Asteraceae) has attracted much attention. However, the closely-related cosmopolitan species T. vulgare has remained outside the mainstream of research in this field. After treating the aerial parts of T. vulgare with dichloromethane and methanol, and applying conventional column and thin-layer chromatographic techniques, it was possible to isolate from the moderately lipophilic fractions the principles responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of this plant against the mouse-ear oedema induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. These were identified by ultraviolet and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as parthenolide (93% oedema inhibition at 0.5 mg/ear, ID50 (dose of drug inhibiting the oedema by 50%) = 0.18 micromol/ear) and the methoxyflavones jaceosidin (80% oedema inhibition at 0.5 mg/ear, ID50 = 0.50 micromol/ear), eupatorin, chrysoeriol and diosmetin. Because in molar terms the potency of parthenolide was nearly three times greater than that of the most active of the flavones and because it is obtained from the plant in considerably larger amounts, the flavonoids must only be partially responsible, and to a minor extent, for the observed in-vivo anti-inflammatory local effect.
Chronic arsenic exposure is known to produce arsenicosis and cancer. To ascertain whether perturbation of methylation plays a role in such carcinogenesis, the degree of methylation of p53 and p16 gene in DNA obtained from blood samples of people chronically exposed to arsenic and skin cancer subjects was studied. Methylation-specific restriction endonuclease digestion followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of gene p53 and bisulfite treatment followed by methylation-sensitive PCR of gene p16 have been carried out to analyze the methylation status of the samples studied. Significant DNA hypermethylation of promoter region of p53 gene was observed in DNA of arsenic-exposed people compared to control subjects. This hypermethylation showed a dose-response relationship. Further, hypermethylation of p53 gene was also observed in arsenic-induced skin cancer patients compared to subjects having skin cancer unrelated to arsenic, though not at significant level. However, a small subgroup of cases showed hypomethylation with high arsenic exposure. Significant hypermethylation of gene p16 was also observed in cases of arsenicosis exposed to high level of arsenic. In man, arsenic has the ability to alter DNA methylation patterns in gene p53 and p16, which are important in carcinogenesis.
We present the case of acute renal failure complicating the course of therapy with both ketorolac (non-selective Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug, NSAID), and celecoxib (COX-2 Selective Inhibitor) in an elderly woman with chronic liver disease, heart failure and chronic renal failure. The main effect of NSAIDs is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme involved in prostaglandins synthesis. The nephrotoxicity of NSAIDs is linked to this effect since prostaglandins not only act in response to inflammatory stimuli, but also play a role as modulators of some physiological renal functions. Under conditions of reduced renal perfusion, acute renal failure secondary to NSAIDs use may occur if the vasoconstrictive forces stimulated to maintain the filtrating function are not balanced by prostaglandin-induced vasodilatation. About ten years ago, two COX isoforms were demonstrated: COX-1 whose products are involved in regulating physiological functions and COX-2 which is expressed by a number of inflammatory stimuli. The discovery of molecular differences between COX-1 and COX-2 allowed the development of pharmacological agents selectively inhibiting COX-1 or COX-2. Selective inhibitors of COX-2 are now available. However, COX-1 products are involved in inflammatory reactions, whereas COX-2 products play a physiological role in many tissues and organs, including the kidney. These observations raised many doubts regarding the renal safety of COX-2 Inhibitors before they became commercially available. These doubts have been recently confirmed in the Literature.
The case we report seems to confirm that, in patients at risk, the renal adverse effects of non-selective NSAIDs and of COX-2 Inhibitors could be the same due to the similar physiological role of COX-1 and COX-2-dependent prostaglandins.
A report of three patients who developed angiodema while receiving enalapril. Patient 1 came in with an 8-hour history of facial swelling after enalapril had been started 2 days earlier. The second patient came in with severe angiodema of the tongue, larynx, and glottis requiring emergency tracheostomy, hydroxyzine, and steroids. He had been treated with enalapril for 1 year. The third patient developed facial swelling within a few hours of the first dose of enalapril. Angiodema with enalapril can occur early or late in the course of therapy. A possible mechanism for this drug reaction is the potentiation of bradykinin with resultant kinin system activation.
Partial hepatectomy (PH) and neonatal rat short-term liver focus models were used to examine the effects of selected chemicals that had been previously tested in the National Toxicology Program (NTP) 2-yr carcinogenicity studies. C.I. Solvent Yellow 14, monuron, chlorendic acid, and 4-hydroxyacetanilide were tested for initiating and promoting activity in the PH model. Chlorendic acid, 4,4'-oxydianiline, 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone (ADBAQ), and 4-hydroxyacetanilide were similarly tested in a neonatal rat liver focus model. With the exception of 4-hydroxyacetanilide which was not carcinogenic in the NTP studies, all chemicals tested showed clear evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity. While none of the chemicals showed initiating activity in either the PH or neonatal models, promoting activity, as indicated by increased number, size, or volume fraction of histochemically detected hepatic foci of cellular alteration, was evident for all chemicals with previously demonstrated hepatocarcinogenicity. Liver tumor incidence was documented at 14 months in the PH model and at 300 days in the neonatal model. On the basis of the results obtained from these few chemicals, it is suggested that the use of short-term rat liver focus models may represent a reliable means for identifying chemicals with hepatocarcinogenic potential.
Retrospective characterization of morphological and stereological features of altered hepatocellular foci (AHF) in hematoxylin & eosin (H&E)-stained sections was performed on 6 conventional 2-yr carcinogenicity studies conducted in Fischer 344 (F344) rats by the National Toxicology Program (NTP). In 3 of these studies where there was clear evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity [1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone (ADBAQ), C.I. Acid Red 114, methyl carbamate], there was greater morphological variability in AHF than in the studies of chemicals that were not hepatocarcinogenic [4-hydroxyacetanilide, epinephrine, dimethoxane]. In addition to having the expected types of AHF, rats treated with ADBAQ, C.I. Acid Red 114, and methyl carbamate had atypical basophilic AHF. In addition, atypical eosinophilic AHF were present in rats treated with ADBAQ. Both types of atypical AHF showed a morphological spectrum and sequential changes suggesting they could develop into hepatocellular neoplasms. For the 3 liver tumor positive studies, there were dose and time-dependent increases in stereological parameters for the atypical as well as commonly occurring clear, vacuolated, and mixed cell AHF. Consistent stereological changes were not found for commonly occurring basophilic and eosinophilic AHF. Aside from some decreases in stereological measurements in some rats treated with 4-hydroxyacetanilide and epinephrine, there were no significant quantitative changes in AHF in the three liver tumor negative studies. These results show that hepatocarcinogens may induce unique types of AHF in conventional 2-yr carcinogenicity/toxicity studies in rats and may cause quantitative increases in commonly occurring clear, vacuolated, and mixed cell AHF. Such qualitative and quantitative changes are potentially useful predictors of hepatic neoplasia.
We report a case of a patient with metastatic testicular cancer and intractable pain refractory to massive doses of oral, intravenous, and intrathecal (IT) opioids supported by analgesic adjuvants. During our efforts to control his pain, the patient exhibited opioid-induced hyperalgesia, an uncommon but important phenomenon seen with high-dose opioid therapy. With appropriate opioid adjustment--in this case reduction of intrathecal morphine dosage by a factor of 100--the condition rapidly resolved and the patient became pain-free and remained so until his death six weeks later. The keys to identifying this uncommon, but treatable, opioid side effect are recognizing it as a possibility when aggressive efforts to control pain with high doses of opioids, especially when administered neuraxially, are met with increasing pain.
We reported a case of a 66-year-old female with uremia who developed myoclonic activity after administration of cefmetazole (4g/2 days). Curiously, the level of the antibiotics (236 micrograms/ml) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was higher than that in the blood (103 micrograms/ml). Myoclonic activity faded away after cessation of the antibiotics. This is the first case reported developing neurotoxicity associated with intravenous administration of cefmetazole. In addition, the curious pharmacokinetic dynamics of cephalosporin in uremia is discussed.
While it is known that risk of death from sepsis is higher in patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease its mechanism is unknown. To study this we established a two-stage mouse model where renal disease was first induced by folic acid injection followed by sub-lethal cecal ligation and puncture to induce sepsis. Septic mice with pre-existing renal disease had significantly higher mortality, serum creatinine, vascular permeability, plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, bacteremia, serum IL-10, splenocyte apoptosis and more severe septic shock when compared to septic mice without pre-existing disease. To evaluate the contribution of vascular and immunological dysfunction, we treated the folate-septic mice with soluble Flt-1 to bind VEGF and chloroquine to reduce splenocyte apoptosis. These treatments together resulted in a significant improvement in kidney injury, hemodynamics and survival. Our study shows that the sequential mouse model mimics human sepsis frequently complicated by pre-existing renal disease and might be useful in evaluating preventive and therapeutic strategies.
Mercury (Hg) is an occupational and environmental contaminant that is a well-recognized health hazard. To approach the concrete mechanisms of mercury nephrotoxicity and find out a new way to prevent it, the rats were subcutaneously injected with different dosages of mercuric chloride (HgCl(2))--0, 2.2, 4.4, and 8.8 μmol/kg. The levels of Hg, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine protein, glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and activities of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were investigated, and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis and the pathological changes were also observed. In addition, the effects of 1 mmol/kg tea polyphenols (TP) and 0.04 mmol/kg schisandrin B (Sch B) were studied at 8.8 μmol/kg HgCl(2). It was observed that the levels of Hg, BUN, urine protein, GSH, and MDA and activities of NAG, ALP, and LDH increased significantly; the activities of SOD and GSH-Px decreased significantly; the levels of ROS and apoptosis increased obviously; and many pathological changes occurred dose-dependently in the HgCl(2) injection groups. Further investigation indicated that pretreatment with TP and Sch B significantly reversed the toxic effects of HgCl(2). These results suggested that TP and Sch B might antagonize the nephrotoxicity caused by HgCl(2) exposure.
Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a well-known human carcinogen associated with the incidence of lung cancer. Although overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been suggested to play a major role in its carcinogenicity, the mechanisms of Cr(VI)-induced ROS production remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of NADPH oxidase (NOX), one of the major sources of cellular ROS, in Cr(VI)-induced oxidative stress and carcinogenesis. We found that short-term exposure to Cr(VI) (2μM) resulted in a rapid increase in ROS generation in Beas-2B cells, and concomitantly increased NOX activity and expression of NOX members (NOX1-3 and NOX5) and subunits (p22(phox), p47(phox), p40(phox), and p67(phox)). Cr(VI) also induced phosphorylation of p47(phox) and membrane translocation of p47(phox) and p67(phox), further confirming NOX activation. Knockdown of p47(phox) with a short hairpin RNA attenuated the ROS production induced by Cr(VI). Chronic exposure (up to 3 months) to low doses of Cr(VI) (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5μM) also promoted ROS generation and the expression of NOX subunits, such as p47(phox) and p67(phox), but inhibited the expression of main antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Chronic Cr(VI) exposure resulted in transformation of Beas-2B cells, increasing cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth in soft agar, and forming aggressive tumors in nude mice. Stable knockdown of p47(phox) or overexpression of SOD1, SOD2, or catalase (CAT) eliminated Cr(VI)-induced malignant transformation. Our results suggest that NOX plays an important role in Cr(VI)-induced ROS generation and carcinogenesis.
Pathologically elevated shear stress triggers aspirin-insensitive platelet thrombosis. Signaling mechanisms involved in shear-induced platelet thrombosis are not well understood. To investigate these, we examined the hypothesis that functionally important platelet phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) activity is stimulated by an in vitro shear stress of 120 dynes/cm(2) (shear rate of 6,000 sec(-1)). Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)) production was examined in washed human platelets subjected to pathological shear stress in a cone-plate viscometer. PIP(3) production peaks 30 s after shear begins and is initiated by von Willebrand factor (VWF) binding to the glycoprotein (Gp) Ib-IX-V complex. Inhibiting PI3-K with wortmannin or 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002) results in the inhibition of shear-induced platelet aggregation. In resting platelets, class IA PI3-K associates with the tyrosine kinase Syk. Within 30 s of beginning shear, PI3-K-associated Syk becomes tyrosine phosphorylated. Inhibiting Syk activation with piceatannol results in the inhibition of PIP(3) production and aggregation. Selective blockade of the P2Y(12) receptor results in the inhibition of Syk phosphorylation, PIP(3) production, and aggregation. These results indicate that shear-induced VWF binding to platelet GpIb-IX-V stimulates functionally important PI3-K activity. PI3-K activation is signaled by rapid feedback amplification that involves P2Y(12) receptor-mediated activation of Syk.
Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease, but the molecular effects of cigarette smoke on vascular cells are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), a collagenase expressed in atherosclerosis and aneurysms but not in the normal vessel wall, is induced in the aortic endothelium of rabbits exposed to cigarette smoke. In vitro cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and one of its components, acrolein, inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K pathway in human endothelial cells, and chemical inhibition of this pathway by rapamycin resulted in elevated MMP-1. Moreover, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-3 (TIMP-3), a major regulator of angiogenesis, is significantly downregulated in aortic endothelial cells treated with CSE, acrolein, or rapamycin. These data indicate that inhibition of mTOR by cigarette smoke components is a key event in the modulation of endothelial MMP-1 and TIMP-3 expression. Our study suggests that circulating smoke components, including acrolein, contribute to vascular diseases through enhanced MMP-1 and decreased TIMP-3 secretion in the endothelium, potentially leading to impaired angiogenesis, matrix disruption, and vessel injury.
The authors describe a case of the catatonia syndrome associated with disulfiram therapy. Although useful in the management of chronic alcoholism, disulfiram is being increasingly associated with a wide spectrum of side effects and untoward medical sequelae, which now include catatonia. The authors note that catatonia is a clinical syndrome associated with multiple medical conditions as well as psychiatric disorders.
A total of 130 obstetrical patients were treated with either low molecular weight (LMW) or unfractionated (UFH) heparin as part of prospective study comparing their efficacy in the prevention of thromboembolism. A single daily dose of 2500-5000 anti-Xa-units LMW heparin (Fragmin) or two to three daily doses of 5000 IU UFH (Liquemin) were given to two groups of 15 patients with therapeutic tocolysis and 50 patients with cesarean section. Patients with cesarean section were given 500 ml Dextran 60 i.v. during surgery followed by subcutaneous injection of heparin eight to ten hours after surgery. Heparin therapy was continued for ten days after surgery. None of the patients exhibited clinical signs of thrombosis. The majority of patients showed symptoms of local irritation at the site of heparin injection (69% of patients with LMW heparin; 80% of patients with UFH). Hematomas at the site of injection were significantly smaller when LMW heparin was used instead of UFH. A number of patients experienced headache after heparin application (10% of patients with LMW heparin; 13% of patients with UFH). There were no cases of post surgical haemorrhage. Comparison of daily profiles revealed a significantly higher anti-Xa-activity of LMW heparin compared to UFH. In contrast, other coagulation parameters were not different in the two experimental groups (antithrombin III, partial thrombin time, thrombin time). Hematologic parameters and liver enzymes were in the physiological range in both experimental groups and none of the patients exhibited signs of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of the electroencephalogram (EEG) effect was combined with intracerebral glutamate determinations using microdialysis for rats receiving norfloxacin intravenously (150 mg/kg of body weight). The EEG effect (accompanied by tremors and seizures) was consistently observed without glutamate level modifications. Therefore, norfloxacin-inducted seizures are not triggered by intracerebral glutamate level enhancement.
Both the antiepileptic, carbamazepine, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, dizocilpine, have shown preclinical efficacy against behavioral and toxic effects of cocaine. Nonetheless, side effects or toxicity of these compounds either alone or in conjunction with cocaine are problematic. 5-Aminocarbonyl-10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,1 0-imine (ADCI), a molecular hybrid of these compounds, has been shown to have a broad anticonvulsant profile with a good protective index (behavioral TD50/anticonvulsant ED50). In male Swiss Webster mice, ADCI and dizocilpine produced dose-dependent protection against the convulsant effects of cocaine that were insensitive to carbamazepine. However, in contrast to dizocilpine, ADCI did not produce behavioral impairment on the inverted screen test demonstrating a protective index of greater than 15; the protective index for dizocilpine was 1.2. All three compounds attenuated the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine without significantly decreasing locomotor activity on their own, although the cocaine antagonism was not always dose dependent. Only dizocilpine increased spontaneous locomotor activity when given alone and augmented the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine. The results confirm the novel anticonvulsant activity of ADCI and its lack of phencyclidine-like behavioral side effects. The data also suggest a modest blocking action of these compounds against the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine.
To describe a case of a thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma that responded to bromocriptine therapy by suppression of thyrotropin and tumor shrinkage.
We present the clinical course, laboratory data, and radiographic findings in a 32-year-old woman with a thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma before and after treatment with bromocriptine.
The patient's pituitary tumor was detected after she had been treated with radioactive iodine for thyrotoxicosis presumed to be due to Graves' disease. After thyroid ablation, the thyrotropin levels could not be brought into the normal range, even while the patient was receiving supraphysiologic doses of orally administered levothyroxine. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary, along with hormonal workup, confirmed the diagnosis of a thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma. Because the tumor was not threatening vital structures and was considered incurable by operation, medical therapy was elected. A trial of bromocriptine was initiated at 15 mg/day and increased to 30 mg/day in three divided doses. Follow-up hormonal studies showed that thyrotropin levels declined into the suppressed range, and repeated magnetic resonance imaging scans showed substantial shrinkage of the pituitary lesion.
Thyrotropin-secreting tumors may respond hormonally and structurally to bromocriptine therapy. In patients with such tumors, a trial of dopamine agonists at high dose may be considered before initiation of more invasive medical treatment.
To describe a patient with an undiagnosed pituitary macroadenoma, in whom pituitary apoplexy developed after heparin anticoagulation for treatment of unstable angina.
We chronicle the clinical course, treatment, and outcome in a 53-year-old woman with pituitary apoplexy. Potential risk factors are also discussed.
In a patient with coronary artery disease and unstable angina, heparin anticoagulation therapy was initiated. Shortly thereafter, severe frontal headaches, nausea and vomiting, high fever, diplopia, and visual field deficits developed. A workup for infectious causes and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid were negative. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the head revealed a pituitary macroadenoma with a central area of hemorrhage, and pituitary apoplexy was diagnosed. Hydrocortisone sodium succinate was administered intravenously, and ultimately, transsphenoidal resection was performed. Postoperatively, diabetes insipidus developed and persisted. Neurologically, she had near-total blindness of the right eye and temporal hemianopia of the left eye.
Although pituitary apoplexy is rare, its occurrence can be associated with certain risk factors, including anticoagulation. Clinicians should be aware of this serious condition so that timely diagnosis and treatment can provide the best chance of recovery.
To report the development of symptoms suggesting transient ischemic attacks during bupropion treatment for smoking cessation.
A 67-year-old white man experienced paresthesia, dizziness, tinnitus, confusion, and gait impairment shortly after starting bupropion as an aid to smoking cessation. Bupropion was discontinued on hospital admission, and testing for vertebral basilar artery disease was negative. His symptoms resolved, and he remained asymptomatic until restarting bupropion two days after hospital discharge.
Although separate case reports have reported sensory disturbances, tinnitus, and balance impairement associated with bupropion use, the combination of symptoms occurring in this patient has not been previously published.
The temporal relationship between bupropion exposure and symptomatology suggests that bupropion caused symptoms mimicking transient ischemic attacks in this patient.
The incidence and type of cerebral lesions in 159 infants born before 30 weeks gestation were studied, using ultrasound. Indomethacin was given as part of tocolytic management to mothers with a high incidence of early rupture of membranes and preterm labour; and 76 fetuses were exposed to the drug as a result. For the remaining 83 pregnancies, in which there was a high incidence of chronic fetal distress and in utero hypoxia, tocolysis was either not started or limited to fenoterol. The neonatal course was similar for both groups of infants, except that patent ductus arteriosus was less commonly diagnosed in the 76 infants exposed to indomethacin. However, the incidence of periventricular leukomalacia was increased among infants exposed to any tocolytic agent; and cystic lesions occurred more commonly in those exposed to indomethacin.
Forty-seven patients with thalassaemia have been studied to define risk factors for development of sensorineural hearing loss, and to establish guidelines for safe chelation. Sensorineural hearing loss was only present in patients who had previously received desferrioxamine (DFO). The two most significant risk factors were the maximum dose of DFO previously received (P less than 0.01), and a serum ferritin of less than 2000 micrograms/l at that time (P less than 0.001). A therapeutic index obtained from the ratio of the mean daily dose of DFO mg/kg divided by the serum ferritin identifies patients with a ratio of greater than 0.025 as at risk of sensorineural hearing loss (P less than 0.001) and can be used as a guideline for safe DFO dosage. Follow-up audiometry of the affected patients over a 2-year period indicated that adjustment of the dose to a therapeutic index of less than 0.025 resulted in the stabilization of hearing loss in seven patients and improvement in two.
The effect of ketanserin (3 mg/kg i.v.) on the baroreceptor heart rate reflex and the Bezold-Jarisch reflex was examined in conscious Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In the control situation (before ketanserin treatment), reflex bradycardia in response to phenylephrine (baroreflex) and phenyldiguanide (Bezold-Jarisch reflex) were impaired in SHR as compared with WKY, while reflex tachycardia in response to nitroprusside was similar in the two groups. However, after ketanserin administration in SHR, there was a reversal of the baroreflex-mediated tachycardia in response to nitroprusside into a bradycardic response. The nitroprusside-induced bradycardia was not caused by the release of 5-HT stimulating chemosensitive vagal afferents since the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist MDL 72222 did not block this response. In the same SHR, the Bezold-Jarisch reflex evoked by phenyldiguanide and the phenylephrine-induced bradycardia were potentiated by ketanserin. All the above effects of ketanserin were less evident in the WKY. Ketanserin did not alter vagal efferent function in anaesthetized SHR since it did not affect bradycardia induced by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. Therefore, it is suggested that ketanserin has sensitised cardiac vagal afferent mechanisms in SHR, which led to a normalization of reflex bradycardic function to a level normally observed in conscious normotensive WKY (i.e. prior to ketanserin treatment).
Reduction of naphthoquinones by DT-diaphorase is often described as a detoxification reaction. This is true for some naphthoquinone derivatives, such as alkyl and di-alkyl naphthoquinones, but the situation with other substances, such as 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, is more complex. In the present study, the effect of several substances that are known to increase tissue activities of DT-diaphorase on the toxicity of 2-amino-1,4-naphthoquinone has been investigated. Like 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, the 2-amino-derivative was found to cause both haemolytic anaemia and renal tubular necrosis in rats. Again like 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, the severity of the haemolysis induced by the 2-amino derivative was increased in animals pre-treated with inducers of DT-diaphorase, but the degree of nephrotoxicity was decreased. With these substances, therefore, DT-diaphorase both activates and detoxifies the quinone, depending on the target organ. It is not possible to generalize with regard to the effects of modulation of tissue levels of DT-diaphorase on naphthoquinone toxicity in vivo, since this may change not only the severity of the toxic effects, but also the target organ specificity. In evaluating the possible therapeutic applications of such compounds, the possibility of toxic effects upon the blood and kidney must be borne in mind. In man, renal damage by compounds such as 2-hydroxy- and 2-amino-1,4-naphthoquinone may be a particular problem, because of the low level of DT-diaphorase in human liver.
Diallyl sulphide (DAS) is a sulphur-containing volatile compound present in garlic (Allium sativum). It has been shown to inhibit a number of chemically induced forms of cancer in experimental animals. The present study demonstrates the inhibitory effect of DAS on the development of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) initiated and 2-acetyl-aminofluorene (2-AAF) promoted preneoplastic altered hepatic foci (AHF) in Wistar rats. AHF were scored and analysed by quantitative stereology using the Image Analysis system from frozen liver sections stained for biological markers, namely glutathione S-transferase, placental form (GST-P), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6 Pase) and alkaline phosphatase (AlkPase). DAS-supplemented rats were found to restore the near-normal levels of enzymes GST-P and GGT when exposed to DEN and 2-AAF. DAS administration following DEN and 2-AAF exposure led to the restoration of enzymic activity of ATPase, G6 Pase and AlkPase, as evident by number and area of the foci. These findings suggest the protective role of DAS in rat hepatocarcinogenesis, by suppressing DEN- and 2-AAF-induced AHF development.
