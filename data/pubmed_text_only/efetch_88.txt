Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) is a plant protein that binds specifically to sugars expressed, among many others, by human gastrointestinal epithelial and immune cells. WGA is a toxic compound and an anti-nutritional factor, but recent works have shown that it may have potential as an anti-tumor drug and as a carrier for oral drugs. To quantitate the toxicity threshold for WGA on normal epithelial cells we previously investigated the effects of the lectin on differentiated Caco2 cells, and showed that in the micromolar range of concentrations WGA could alter the integrity of the epithelium layer and increase its permeability to both mannitol and dextran. WGA was shown to be uptaken by Caco2 cells and only approximately 0.1% molecules were observed to cross the epithelium layer by transcytosis. Here we show that at nanomolar concentrations WGA is unexpectedly bioactive on immune cells. The supernatants of WGA-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) can alter the integrity of the epithelium layer when administered to the basolateral side of differentiated Caco2 cells and the effects can be partially inhibited by monoclonal antibodies against IL1, IL6 and IL8. At nanomolar concentrations WGA stimulates the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus the biological activity of WGA should be reconsidered by taking into account the effects of WGA on the immune system at the gastrointestinal interface. These results shed new light onto the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of gastrointestinal disorders observed in vivo upon dietary intake of wheat-based foods.
Cardiac hypertrophy is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure, and thus represents an attractive target for novel therapeutic intervention. JQ1, a small molecule inhibitor of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) acetyl-lysine reader proteins, was identified in a high throughput screen designed to discover novel small molecule regulators of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. JQ1 dose-dependently blocked agonist-dependent hypertrophy of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and reversed the prototypical gene program associated with pathological cardiac hypertrophy. JQ1 also blocked left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and improved cardiac function in adult mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). The BET family consists of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT. BRD4 protein expression was increased during cardiac hypertrophy, and hypertrophic stimuli promoted recruitment of BRD4 to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the gene encoding atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). Binding of BRD4 to the ANF TSS was associated with increased phosphorylation of local RNA polymerase II. These findings define a novel function for BET proteins as signal-responsive regulators of cardiac hypertrophy, and suggest that small molecule inhibitors of these epigenetic reader proteins have potential as therapeutics for heart failure.
Alpha synuclein is increased in dopamine neurons of cocaine abusers and in rats whose alcohol preference is inbred. Recent studies have shown increased alpha synuclein protein expression in serum of alcoholic patients that is linked with severity of alcohol craving. The aim of this study was to analyze the serum levels of alpha synuclein in healthy subjects and in recently abstinent cocaine abusers. Alpha synuclein protein expression was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum specimens obtained from 38 recently abstinent cocaine dependent patients and 14 control subjects. The presence of cocaine dependence disorder was based on the Structured Clinical Interview (DSM-IV). Drug severity was assessed by the Addiction Severity Index ratings and composite measures. Scores of the intensity and frequency of cocaine craving episodes were obtained from the Minnesota Cocaine Craving Questionnaire. The serum concentrations of alpha synuclein in cocaine dependent patients were significantly higher as compared with age-matched drug-free controls (p<0.001). Alpha synuclein levels in blood were significantly correlated with the intensity (r=0.60, p<0.001) and frequency (r=0.64, p<0.001) of cocaine craving and with 30 days of cocaine use in the prior month before entry to treatment (r=0.56, p<0.005). However, there was no correlation between the serum protein levels of alpha synuclein and age in either group. This report is the first demonstration of altered alpha synuclein levels in peripheral blood from cocaine abusers. These data agree with previous reports in postmortem brain of cocaine abusers and provide support for an association between alpha synuclein and cocaine dependence.
Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens. To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus. We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use. In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria.
We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999-2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen. In these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria/day. Laboratory results were compared between prior, during and following sirolimus use.
Twenty-eight patients (24%) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post-transplantation course. In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive. In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic-range proteinuria. Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. In most patients, discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of proteinuria.
Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre-existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients. Proteinuria may improve, but does not resolve, when sirolimus is withdrawn.
Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) have hyperactivity of their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sometimes accompanied by elevations of cortisol. We examined whether the normal effects of short-term dexamethasone treatment upon HPA axis suppression and appetite stimulation are observed in these patients. Five young women with AN and ten healthy female controls received one week of high-dose oral dexamethasone (2 mg/m2/d) preceded and followed by hormonal evaluation of sensitivity to glucocorticoids and psychological assessments. No differences in hormone levels of the HPA axis were observed between the two groups and control groups at baseline, after dexamethasone suppression, or following ACTH stimulation testing. However, fasting insulin levels were significantly lower in the AN group, both before and after dexamethasone therapy and their serum leptin levels were also significantly lower. The AN group had significantly lower scores on the Anorexia Nervosa Subtest and the Beck Depression Inventory after dexamethasone compared to controls. On daily analog scales, AN patients had higher anxiety scores while on dexamethasone. Normal sensitivity to glucocorticoids was observed in all parameters examined except for mild abnormalities in pancreatic beta-cell function. These data suggest that AN may represent a state of partial glucocorticoid resistance, as in other states of restricted food intake. Furthermore, these pilot data, including the effects of dexamethasone upon psychological outlook in AN, suggest that glucocorticoids are not an effective therapy for these patients.
Low-molecular weight chromium compounds, such as chromium picolinate [Cr(pic)(3)], improve insulin sensitivity, although toxicity is a concern. We synthesized a novel chromium complex, chromium (d-phenylalanine)(3) [Cr(d-phe)(3)], in an attempt to improve insulin sensitivity with reduced toxicity. The aim of this study was to compare the two chromium compounds on cardiac contractile function in ob/ob obese mice.
C57BL lean and ob/ob obese mice were randomly divided into three groups: H(2)O, Cr(d-phe)(3), or Cr(pic)(3) (45 mug/kg per day orally for 6 months).
The glucose tolerance test displayed improved glucose clearance by Cr(d-phe)(3) but not Cr(pic)(3). Myocytes from ob/ob mice exhibited depressed peak shortening (PS) and maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening (+/-dL/dt), prolonged time-to-PS and time-to-90% relengthening (TR90), reduced electrically stimulated rise in intracellular Ca(2+) (Deltafura-2 fluorescence intensity), and slowed intracellular Ca(2+) decay. Although a 3-month Cr(d-phe)(3) treatment for a separate group of ob/ob and lean 2-month-old mice only rectified reduced +/-dL/dt in ob/ob mice, all mechanical and intracellular Ca(2+) abnormalities were significantly attenuated or ablated by 6 months of Cr(d-phe)(3) but not Cr(pic)(3) treatment (except TR90). Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase activity and Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger expression were depressed in ob/ob mice, which were reversed by both Cr(d-phe)(3) and Cr(pic)(3), with a more pronounced effect from Cr(d-phe)(3). Cr(d-phe)(3) corrected reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and improved basal phosphorylation of Akt and insulin receptor, as well as insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and insulin receptor in ob/ob myocytes. Heart homogenates from ob/ob mice had enhanced oxidative stress and protein carbonyl formation compared with the lean group, which were attenuated by both Cr(d-phe)(3) and Cr(pic)(3).
Our data suggest that the new Cr(d-phe)(3) compound possesses better cardio-protective and insulin-sensitizing properties against obesity.
To review evidence-based treatment options in patients with cerebral edema complicating fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) and discuss the potential applications of hypothermia.
Case-based observations from a medical intensive care unit (MICU) in a tertiary care facility in a 27-year-old female with FHF from acetaminophen and resultant cerebral edema.
Our patient was admitted to the MICU after being found unresponsive with presumed toxicity from acetaminophen which was ingested over a 2-day period. The patient had depressed of mental status lasting at least 24 h prior to admission. Initial evaluation confirmed FHF from acetaminophen and cerebral edema. The patient was treated with hyperosmolar therapy, hyperventilation, sedation, and chemical paralysis. Her intracranial pressure remained elevated despite maximal medical therapy. We then initiated therapeutic hypothermia which was continued for 5 days. At re-warming, patient had resolution of her cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension. At discharge, she had complete recovery of neurological and hepatic functions.
In patients with FHF and cerebral edema from acetaminophen overdose, prolonged therapeutic hypothermia could potentially be used as a life saving therapy and a bridge to hepatic and neurological recovery. A clinical trial of hypothermia in patients with this condition is warranted.
Despite numerous neuroendocrinological studies of seizures, the influence of estrogen and progesterone on seizures and epilepsy remains unclear. This may be due to the fact that previous studies have not systematically compared distinct endocrine conditions and included all relevant controls. The goal of the present study was to conduct such a study using pilocarpine as chemoconvulsant. Thus, age and weight-matched, intact or ovariectomized rats were tested to determine incidence of status epilepticus and to study events leading to status. Intact female rats were sampled at each cycle stage (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, or diestrus 2). Convulsant was administered at the same time of day, 10:00-10:30 a.m. Statistical analysis showed that there was a significantly lower incidence of status on the morning of estrus, but differences were attenuated in older animals. Ovariectomized rats were distinct in their rapid progression to status. These results show that the incidence of status in female rats following pilocarpine injection, and the progression to pilocarpine-induced status, are influenced by reproductive state as well as age. The hormonal milieu present specifically on the morning of estrus appears to decrease susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced status, particularly at young ages. In contrast, the chronic absence of reproductive steroids that characterizes the ovariectomized rat leads to a more rapid progression to status. This dissociation between incidence vs. progression provides new insight into the influence of estrogen and progesterone on seizures.
We measured the effect of posture on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in eight patients admitted with grade 4 hepatic coma due to fulminant hepatic failure complicated by renal failure. Upward head elevation greater than 20 degrees did not consistently reduce ICP; instead, ICP increased in three patients who later died of cerebral edema. CPP was reduced significantly by elevation greater than 20 degrees, falling to less than 50 mm Hg in those patients who subsequently died of cerebral edema. Our study does not support the current practice of nursing patients with hepatic coma, who are at risk of dying from cerebral edema, in head-upright postures greater than 20 degrees.
Neuroleptic primed Cebus apella monkeys have proven reliable in screening antipsychotics for extrapyramidal side effect (EPS) potential in humans, and the ratio EPS liability/antiamphetamine efficacy ["therapeutic index" (TI)] has fit well with clinical results.
1) To find the TIs of one new (quetiapine), three potential [NNC 756 (dopamine (DA) D1 antagonist), NNC 22-0031 (alpha-1 adrenergic/5-HT2 serotonergic/DA D1 and D2 antagonist) and DOD 647 (DA D1 and D2 antagonist)] and three old antipsychotics (haloperidol, melperone and clozapine), 2) to test the model further and 3) to gain more insight as to clozapine's neuropharmacology.
Seven monkeys received haloperidol daily for 2 years; all were sensitized to dystonia. All drugs were given SC, in increasing doses until two animals had dystonia/other adverse effects (AE), and in decreasing doses with a fixed dose of dextroamphetamine producing motor unrest and stereotypies, to find the minimum significant antiamphetamine dose (AA). The ratio AE/AA = TI.
Excepting clozapine and DOD 647, all drugs induced dystonia. At 2-4 mg/kg, clozapine caused uncoordinated movements, myoclonic jerks and rough tremor; unlike dystonia, the syndrome was not alleviated but worsened by the anticholinergic, biperiden. DOD 647 up to 2 mg/kg had no adverse effects. The TIs of the new and potential antipsychotics were 3-5 versus 4 for clozapine and 1 for haloperidol and melperone, suggesting that like clozapine, these new drugs will not produce EPS at antipsychotic doses.
1,5-Anhydro-6-deoxy-methane-sulfamido-D-glucitol (FCP5) is a functionalized carbohydrate containing functional groups that render it potentially therapeutically useful. According to our concept of 'functional carb-pharmacophores' (FCPs) incorporation of the methanesulfonamido pharmacophore to 1,5 glucitol could create a therapeutically useful compound. Our previous studies revealed that FCP5 was cytotoxic to cancer cells. Therefore, in this work we assessed the cytotoxic mechanisms of FCP5 in four cancer cell lines - HeLa, LoVo, A549 and MCF-7, with particular focus on DNA damage and repair. A broad spectrum of methods, including comet assay with modifications, DNA repair enzyme assay, plasmid relaxation assay, and DNA fragmentation assay, were used. We also checked the potential for FCP5 to induce apoptosis. The results show that FCP5 can induce DNA strand breaks as well as oxidative modifications of DNA bases. DNA lesions induced by FCP5 were not entirely repaired in HeLa cells and DNA repair kinetics differs from other cell lines. Results from molecular docking and plasmid relaxation assay suggest that FCP5 binds to the major groove of DNA with a preference for adenosine-thymine base pair sequences and directly induces DNA strand breaks. Thus, FCP5 may represent a novel lead for the design of new major groove-binding compounds. The results also confirmed the validity of functional carb-pharmacophores as a new source of innovative drugs.
Anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) antibody characteristics including light chain, IgG subclass, avidity for denervated human acetylcholine receptor and reaction with various human and mammalian AChR preparations were examined in 11 patients who developed myasthenia during penicillamine treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Results were compared with those already reported in 35 patients with generalized idiopathic myasthenia gravis (MG). We found significant differences in the avidity and the light chain of the anti-AChR. However, anti-AChR characteristics in 12 patients with recent onset (less than 4 months' duration) idiopathic MG did not differ significantly from those in patients with penicillamine-induced MG. In the patients with generalized MG a trend was found towards higher percentage of kappa light chain and higher anti-AChR avidity with duration of disease. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in penicillamine-induced myasthenia gravis therefore appear to be similar to those of idiopathic myasthenia gravis of recent onset.
Cancer pain is a major public health problem worldwide due to the strong impact on the quality of life of patients and side effects of the existing therapeutic options. Monoterpenes, as carvacrol (CARV), have been extensively studied about their therapeutic properties, especially their importance in the control of painful conditions and inflammation, which can be improved through the use of inclusion complexes of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). We evaluated the effect of encapsulation of CARV in β-CD (CARV/β-CD) on the nociception induced by tumor cells (Sarcoma 180) in rodents. Inclusion complexes were prepared in two different procedures and characterized through thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy. CARV/β-CD complex was administered (50 mg/kg, p.o.) in mice with tumor on the hind paw and was able to reduce the hyperalgesia (von Frey) during 24 h, unlike the free CARV (100 mg/kg, p.o.), which promoted effects until 9 h. Administration on alternate days of complex of CARV/β-CD (12.5-50 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced hyperalgesia, as well as spontaneous and palpation-induced nociception. However, pure CARV (50 mg/kg) did not cause significant changes in nociceptive responses. Together, these results produced evidence that the encapsulation of carvacrol in β-cyclodextrin can be useful for the development of new options for pain management.
Sepsis is a cluster of heterogeneous syndromes associated with progressive endotoxemic developments, ultimately leading to damage of multiple organs, including the heart. This study is to investigate the effects of apigenin on heart injury in lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemic rat model. Normal Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group, LPS group (15mg/kg), LPS plus apigenin groups with different apigenin doses (50mg/kg, 100mg/kg). Serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured after the rats were sacrificed. SphK1/S1P signaling pathway proteins, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, Bax and Bcl-2 in heart were measured by Western blot. In vitro, we evaluated the protective effect of apigenin on rat embryonic heart-derived myogenic cell line H9c2 induced by LPS. Apigenin decreased serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β. SphK1/S1P signaling pathway proteins, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, Bax in heart were found inhibited and Bcl-2 increased in the apigenin groups in vivo. In addition, apigenin inhibited intracellular calcium, the MAPK pathway and SphK1/S1P signaling pathway in vitro. Apigenin exerts pronounced cardioprotection in rats subjected to LPS likely through suppressing myocardial apoptosis and inflammation by inhibiting the SphK1/S1P signaling pathway.
Organophosphorus-ester induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia progressing to paralysis with a concomitant central and peripheral, distal axonapathy. Diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) produces OPIDN in the chicken that results in mild ataxia in 7-14 days and severe paralysis as the disease progresses with a single dose. White leghorn layer hens were treated with DFP (1.7 mg/kg, sc) after prophylactic treatment with atropine (1mg/kg, sc) in normal saline and eserine (1mg/kg, sc) in dimethyl sulfoxide. Control groups were treated with vehicle propylene glycol (0.1 ml/kg, sc), atropine in normal saline and eserine in dimethyl sulfoxide. The hens were euthanized at different time points such as 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 days, and the tissues from cerebrum, midbrain, cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord were quickly dissected and frozen for mRNA (northern) studies. Northern blots were probed with BCL2, GADD45, beta actin, and 28S RNA to investigate their expression pattern. Another set of hens was treated for a series of time points and perfused with phosphate buffered saline and fixative for histological studies. Various staining protocols such as Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E); Sevier-Munger; Cresyl echt Violet for Nissl substance; and Gallocynin stain for Nissl granules were used to assess various patterns of cell death and degenerative changes. Complex cell death mechanisms may be involved in the neuronal and axonal degeneration. These data indicate altered and differential mRNA expressions of BCL2 (anti apoptotic gene) and GADD45 (DNA damage inducible gene) in various tissues. Increased cell death and other degenerative changes noted in the susceptible regions (spinal cord and cerebellum) than the resistant region (cerebrum), may indicate complex molecular pathways via altered BCL2 and GADD45 gene expression, causing the homeostatic imbalance between cell survival and cell death mechanisms. Semi quantitative analysis revealed that the order of severity of damage declines from the spino-cerebellar, ventral, and dorsal tract respectively, suggesting neuroanatomical specificity. Thus, early activation of cell death and cell survival processes may play significant role in the clinical progression and syndromic clinical feature presentation of OPIDN.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically fed a high-unsaturated-fat diet for 130 days by using total enteral nutrition (TEN), or the same diet in which ethanol (EtOH) isocalorically replaced carbohydrate calories. Additional groups were supplemented with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 1.7 g·kg(-1)·day(-1). Relative to an ad libitum chow-fed group, the high-fat-fed controls had three- to fourfold greater expression of fatty acid transporter CD36 mRNA and developed mild steatosis but little other hepatic pathology. NAC treatment resulted in increased somatic growth relative to controls (4.0 ± 0.1 vs. 3.1 ± 0.1 g/day) and increased hepatic steatosis score (3.5 ± 0.6 vs. 2.7 ± 1.2), associated with suppression of the triglyceride hydrolyzing protein adiponutrin, but produced no elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Chronic EtOH treatment increased expression of fatty acid transport protein FATP-2 mRNA twofold, resulting in marked hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and a twofold elevation in serum ALT. However, no changes in tumor necrosis factor-α or transforming growth factor-β expression were observed. Fibrosis, as measured by Masson's trichrome and picrosirius red staining, and a twofold increase in expression of type I and type III collagen mRNA, was only observed after EtOH treatment. Long-term EtOH treatment increased hepatocyte proliferation but did not modify the hepatic mRNAs for hedgehog pathway ligands or target genes or genes regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Although the effects of NAC on EtOH-induced fibrosis could not be fully evaluated, NAC had additive effects on hepatocyte proliferation and prevented EtOH-induced oxidative stress and necrosis, despite a failure to reverse hepatic steatosis.
The incidence, prevalence, and hospitalization rates associated with heart failure (HF) are projected to increase substantially in the world. Among all medications used clinically to treat HF, valsartan (VAL) and spironolactone (SPL) have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. Recently, a novel cardiac gene cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HF. However, the ability of VAL and SPL to modulate the expression of CT-1 has not been investigated yet. Therefore, healthy and isoproterenol (ISO)-induced hypertrophy adult male Wistar albino rats were treated with either VAL or SPL for 14 days. Thereafter, cardiac markers of cardiotoxicity and hypertrophy, creatine kinase, heart weight/body weight ratio, and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA levels were measured. In addition, CT-1 mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Our results showed that the increases in all HF markers, creatine kinase, heart weight/body weight ratio, and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA levels in ISO-treated rats were significantly restored to their normal levels by VAL and SPL. In addition, induction of cardiac hypertrophy by ISO caused remarkable induction in CT-1 mRNA and protein expression levels by approximately 3.5- and 3-fold, respectively. Importantly, VAL and SPL significantly decreased the induction of CT-1 gene at the mRNA and protein levels in heart hypertrophied rats. On the other hand, treatment of cardiac-derived rat myoblast H9c2 cells with VAL and SPL significantly decreased angiotensin II-induced CT-1 mRNA levels through transcriptional mechanism, as demonstrated by the effect of transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D. In conclusion, VAL and SPL exhibited their cardioprotective effect through inhibiting the expression of CT-1 gene in cardiac hypertrophied rats.
To evaluate the association between intracranial hypertension (IH) and isotretinoin use.
Observational case series.
In this retrospective study, approximately 1950 case reports of adverse ocular side effects related to isotretinoin were received from spontaneous reporting systems. Reports were evaluated as to the occurrence of IH with isotretinoin use. A survey was mailed to all members of the North American Neuro-ophthalmology Society soliciting their opinions on whether isotretinoin caused IH.
One hundred seventy-nine reports of IH were associated with isotretinoin use. The mean time from drug exposure to IH diagnosis was 2.3 months. There were 6 cases of positive rechallenge; 5 new cases are reported here, along with 1 previously published report. Of neuro-ophthalmologists surveyed (62% response rate), 6% believed an association between IH and isotretinoin use was certain; 32%, probable; 52%, possible; and 10%, unlikely. Twelve respondents (4%) had personally seen one or more cases of positive rechallenge with isotretinoin causing IH.
Based on the number and pattern of rapid IH onsets after isotretinoin exposure and the 6 cases of positive rechallenge, along with the probable similarity in metabolic pathways of this agent and vitamin A (a known cause of IH), it seems certain that there is a direct correlation between IH and isotretinoin use.
To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) measured by office and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) during treatment and, after patients have missed two doses.
After a single blind run-in 4-week placebo period, 58 patients were randomly allocated to amlodipine (5mg/daily, n=30) or nifedipine GITS (30mg/daily; n=28) in a double-blind, double dummy fashion. Patients received active medication for 4 weeks. Then, to simulate failure of compliance, patients received two single blinded doses of placebo. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was carried out at the end of run-in placebo phase, the first day, the last day of active treatment and up to 72h after the last active dose.
Diastolic blood pressure was controlled in 61.9% patients on amlodipine and 52.9% on nifedipine GITS. Reductions in blood pressure were similar in both groups. ABPM showed significant reduction in blood pressure from the first day in the nifedipine GITS group, while amlodipine group had marginal effect. Peak reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 26/15mmHg at 5-6h after ingestion of amlodipine tablets. The trough reduction was 22/13mmHg; with a trough-to-peak ratio of 84.61% for systolic and 86.67% for diastolic blood pressure. Peak reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with nifedipine GITS was 19/15mmHg and the trough reduction was 21/17mmHg, giving a trough-to-peak ratio of 100% for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. When patients received placebo after 4 weeks of active treatment, simulating a compliance failure, amlodipine maintained reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure for at least up to 72h after the last active dose, maintaining 57.71% of the effect for systolic blood pressure and 60.00% for diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, nifedipine GITS effect was rapidly lost during this study phase, with a reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of only 14-16%, 72h after the last active dose.
This study showed that amlodipine and nifedipine GITS reduce blood pressure to about the same extent during chronic treatment. In the case of compliance failure, such as missing one or two doses, amlodipine maintained significant and important antihypertensive effect with the trough-to-peak ratio still over 50% 72h after the last active dose. On the other hand, the coverage of nifedipine GITS was limited to about 36h after the last active dose.
We report the first case, to our knowledge, of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis complicating transurethral prostatic resection for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient had been catheterized preoperatively because of urinary retention and, postoperatively, developed pyrexia with persistent methicillin-resistant S. aureus-positive blood cultures. The cause remained elusive, despite extensive investigations (including echocardiography), until he developed embolic phenomena pathognomonic of infective endocarditis 1 month into treatment with intravenous vancomycin.
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) plays an important role in mediating hepatocyte injury in various liver pathologies. TNF treatment alone does not cause the death of primary cultured hepatocytes, suggesting other factors are necessary to mediate TNF-induced injury. In this work the question of whether reactive oxygen species can sensitize primary cultured hepatocytes to TNF-induced apoptosis and necrosis was investigated. Sublethal levels of H(2)O(2), either as bolus doses or steady-state levels generated by glucose oxidase, were found to sensitize cultured hepatocytes to TNF-induced apoptosis. High levels of H(2)O(2) also triggered necrosis in hepatocytes regardless of whether TNF was present. Similarly, antimycin, a complex III inhibitor that increases reactive oxygen species generation from mitochondria, sensitized hepatocytes to TNF-induced apoptosis at low doses but caused necrosis at high doses. Redox changes seem to be important in sensitizing primary hepatocytes, because diamide, a thiol-oxidizing agent, and 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), an inhibitor of GSSG reductase, also increased TNF-induced apoptosis in cultured primary hepatocytes at sublethal doses. High doses of diamide and BCNU predominantly triggered necrotic cell death. Agents that sensitized hepatocytes to TNF-induced apoptosis -- H(2)O(2), antimycin, diamide, BCNU -- all caused a dramatic fall in the GSH/GSSG ratio. These redox alterations were found to inhibit TNF-induced IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation and NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus, thus presumably inhibiting expression of genes necessary to inhibit the cytotoxic effects of TNF. Taken together, these results suggest that oxidation of the intracellular environment of hepatocytes by reactive oxygen species or redox-modulating agents interferes with NF-kappaB signaling pathways to sensitize hepatocytes to TNF-induced apoptosis. The TNF-induced apoptosis seems to occur only in a certain redox range -- in which redox changes can inhibit NF-kappaB activity but not completely inhibit caspase activity. The implication for liver disease is that concomitant TNF exposure and reactive oxygen species, either extrinsically generated (e.g., nonparenchymal or inflammatory cells) or intrinsically generated in hepatocytes (e.g., mitochondria), may act in concert to promote apoptosis and liver injury.
Changes in uterine tone have been postulated as the cause of fetal bradycardia following subarachnoid administration of fentanyl for labor analgesia. Such a case occurred in a 20-year-old parturient with an intrauterine pressure catheter in place.
The patient was given intravenous terbutaline, after which contractions ceased for 20-30 minutes and then resumed.
The patient underwent successful cesarean delivery. Retrospective analysis of the data revealed a significant increase in uterine tone and contractions following fentanyl administration.
This case supports the view that changes in uterine tone, producing a hyperdynamic contractile state and a resulting decrease in uteroplacental perfusion, may explain the fetal bradycardia following subarachnoid opioid administration. Cases that do not resolve spontaneously may respond to intravenous terbutaline.
To determine the frequency and severity of hypersensitivity reactions to phenytoin, we reviewed 38 cases of proven reactions. Patients were included only if no other drugs, including other anticonvulsants, were in use at the time of the reaction. Rashes were most frequent, followed by fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, abnormal liver function tests, blood dyscrasias, serum sickness, renal failure, and polymyositis. The pseudolymphoma syndrome, (fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy) occurred in nine patients. Thirty-five of the 38 reactions occurred within 2 months of the start of therapy. Phenytoin sensitivity accounted for 467 inpatient days during the 14 years of study. Early recognition of phenytoin reactions, prompt drug withdrawal, and appropriate therapeutic measures were necessary to prevent serious morbidity from phenytoin hypersensitivity.
