IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 are homologous members of the IQGAP family of scaffold proteins. Accumulating evidence implicates IQGAPs in tumorigenesis. We recently reported that IQGAP2 deficiency leads to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mice. In the current study we extend these findings, and investigate IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 expression in human HCC.
IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 protein expression was assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. IQGAP mRNA was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The methylation status of the Iqgap2 promoter was determined by pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA.
IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 expression was reciprocally altered in 6/6 liver cancer cell lines. Similarly, immunohistochemical staining of 82 HCC samples showed that IQGAP2 protein expression was reduced in 64/82 (78.0%), while IQGAP1 was present in 69/82 (84.1%). No IQGAP1 staining was detected in 23/28 (82.1%) normal livers, 4/4 (100.0%) hepatic adenomas and 23/23 (100.0%) cirrhosis cases, while IQGAP2 was increased in 22/28 (78.6%), 4/4 (100.0%) and 23/23 (100.0%), respectively. Although the Iqgap2 promoter was not hypermethylated in HCC at any of the 25 CpG sites studied (N = 17), IQGAP2 mRNA levels were significantly lower in HCC specimens (N = 23) than normal livers (N = 6).
We conclude that increased IQGAP1 and/or decreased IQGAP2 contribute to the pathogenesis of human HCC. Furthermore, downregulation of IQGAP2 in HCC occurs independently of hypermethylation of the Iqgap2 promoter. Immunostaining of IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 may aid in the diagnosis of HCC, and their pharmacologic modulation may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver cancer.
The dentate gyrus continues to produce granule neurons throughout life. Mossy fibers, the axons of granule neurons, undergo atypical sprouting in both clinical and experimental mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) has been hypothesized to underlie the network reorganization that is thought to produce spontaneously recurring seizures, possibly via the formation of new recurrent excitatory circuits. Hippocampal neurogenesis may be a critical step in the development of MFS, given that it is enhanced by at least 2-fold in the aftermath of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Since it is known that serotonin (5-HT) 1A receptor activation also increases granule cell genesis in the dentate gyrus in rats, and reciprocally, that blockade of this receptor decreases it, we examined whether 5-HT(1A) receptor blockade would prevent the seizure-induced enhancement of neurogenesis. The ability to block seizure-induced neurogenesis would provide a test for its role in the network reorganization, especially in regards to MFS, which might underlie seizure development. In the present study, it was found that blockade of the 5-HT(1A) receptor before and after pilocarpine treatment prevented seizure-induced hippocampal cell proliferation and survival, and, its prevention by chronic treatment with a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist (WAY-100,635) did not prevent the development of MFS or spontaneously recurring seizures. Taken together, these results suggest that 5-HT(1A) receptor activation is a critical step in the activation of seizure-induced cell proliferation and survival in the dentate gyrus, however, not for the onset of spontaneously recurrent seizures and MFS.
Intramyocellular triglyceride (IMTG) correlates with insulin resistance, but there is no clear causal relationship. Insulin resistance and associated hyperinsulinaemia may increase IMTG, via the insulin-regulated transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1). PPAR agonists may also affect IMTG via changes in insulin sensitivity, SREBP-1 or other factors.
We examined skeletal muscle IMTG and SREBP-1 expression, and metabolic parameters in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF) after 25 weeks of PPAR-gamma or PPAR-alpha administration.
Compared with Zucker lean rats (ZL), untreated ZDF had significantly higher weights, serum glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, total cholesterol and triglycerides. IMTG and SREBP-1c messenger RNA (mRNA) were also higher in untreated ZDF; both were decreased by fenofibrate (FF). Rosiglitazone (Rosi), despite marked improvement in glycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia, failed to affect SREBP-1 expression, and increased body weight and IMTG. Rosi/FF combination caused less weight gain and no IMTG increase, despite metabolic effects similar to Rosi alone.
IMTG and SREBP-1c mRNA are high in the ZDF. FF and Rosi both improved insulin sensitivity but had opposite effects on IMTG. Thus, there was a clear discordance between insulin sensitivity and IMTG with PPAR agonists, indicating that IMTG and insulin sensitivity do not share a simple relationship.
Carisoprodol is a commonly used skeletal muscle relaxant with potential for abuse because of its active metabolite, meprobamate, and several reports have suggested that patients abruptly stopping intake of carisoprodol may have a withdrawal syndrome. The authors studied changes in the occurrence of somatic dysfunctions in five patients during an 8-day period following discontinuation from large doses of carisoprodol. Results showed that the number of somatic dysfunctions changed significantly during the withdrawal period. Each patient had an increase in the number of somatic dysfunctions during the first 3 days after cessation of carisoprodol with return to at or near baseline by the eighth day. This was reflected statistically in a significant-within-subjects effect for time. Results of supplemental analyses revealed a significant component of the effect and a trend for the quadratic component to be significant. Increases in the number of somatic dysfunctions during carisoprodol discontinuation support the existence of a carisoprodol withdrawal syndrome.
We describe a patient with a polyethylene tube to the middle ear who developed severe deafness and vertigo after treatment with ear drops where neomycin B was considered to be the most likely offending agent. High concentration of this antibiotic in the ear drops and access of the solution to the round window membrane in the absence of inflammatory edema and secretion may have been significant factors contributing to this serious side effect. Less ototoxic preparations should be used in patients with perforated tympanic membranes or grommets.
HER2 overexpression/amplification has been reported to be a predictor of prognosis in breast cancer and a potential marker for selecting the optimal adjuvant chemotherapy.
HER2 expression and its interaction with treatment were retrospectively evaluated in 266 of 348 patients in a trial comparing adjuvant CMF (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil) with weekly epirubicin in stage I/II breast cancer. HER2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the monoclonal antibody CB11. Initially, any cell showing definite membrane staining was counted, and HER2 overexpression was analyzed as a continuous variable and as a dichotomous variable, with a cutoff of > 50% of positively stained cells. Subsequently, the same slides were reanalyzed with the HercepTest.
Of the 266 tumors immunostained for HER2, 34% exhibited nearly homogeneous staining with > 50% positive cells. When the HercepTest was applied, 8% of tumors were IHC 3+ and 8% were IHC 2+. At 8 years, no statistically significant difference in relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was observed between the treatment arms in patients with low versus high HER2 overexpression, although the number of events is low. The OS was statistically shorter in patients with high HER2 overexpression in the CMF arm, whereas no difference was observed in the epirubicin arm, suggesting that patients whose cancer overexpresses HER2 could benefit more from anthracycline-based therapy.
HER2 overexpression was associated with a poorer OS but not a poorer RFS. However, a Cox regression model did not confirm the prognostic role of HER2 for OS.
This study tests the hypothesis that central sensitization initiated by nociceptive input can be maintained by repeated brief innocuous peripheral inputs. Capsaicin was injected intradermally into the hind paw of adult rats. Three different types of daily cutaneous mechanical stimulations (vibration, soft brush, or pressure) were applied to the capsaicin-injected paw for a period of 2 weeks. Daily stimulation consisted of a 10-s stimulation repeated every 30s for 30 min. Foot withdrawal thresholds to von Frey stimuli applied to the paw were measured once a day for 4 weeks. The capsaicin-only group (control rats without daily stimulation) showed hyperalgesia lasting for 3 days. In contrast, hyperalgesia persisted for 2 weeks in the group that received vibration stimulation. Neither the soft brush nor the pressure group showed a significant difference in mechanical threshold from the control group (capsaicin only). The vibration-induced prolonged hyperalgesia was significantly reduced by systemic injection of ifenprodil, an NMDA-receptor antagonist, but it was not influenced by either an AMPA-receptor blocker or a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. Furthermore, a dorsal column lesion did not interfere with the prolongation of hyperalgesia. Data suggest that vibration-induced prolongation of hyperalgesia is mediated by spinal NMDA-receptors, and a similar mechanism may underlie some forms of chronic pain with no obvious causes, such as complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS-1).
Hyperthermia is a potentially fatal manifestation of severe 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) intoxication. No proven effective drug treatment exists to reverse this potentially life-threatening hyperthermia, likely because mechanisms of peripheral thermogenesis are poorly understood. Using a rat model of MDMA hyperthermia, we evaluated the acute drug-induced changes in plasma catecholamines and used these results as a basis for the selection of drugs that could potentially reverse this hyperthermia.
Prospective, controlled, randomized animal study.
A research institute laboratory.
Male, adult Sprague-Dawley rats.
Based on MDMA-induced changes in plasma catecholamine levels, rats were subjected to the nonselective (beta1 + beta2) adrenergic receptor antagonists propranolol or nadolol or the alpha1- + beta1,2,3-adrenergic receptor antagonist carvedilol before or after a thermogenic challenge of MDMA.
Plasma catecholamines levels 30 mins after MDMA (40 mg/kg, subcutaneously) were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. Core temperature was measured by a rectal probe attached to a thermocouple. Four hours after MDMA treatment, blood was drawn and serum creatine kinase levels were measured as a marker of rhabdomyolysis using a Vitros analyzer. MDMA induced a 35-fold increase in norepinephrine levels, a 20-fold increase in epinephrine, and a 2.4-fold increase in dopamine levels. Propranolol (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or nadolol (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) administered 30 mins before MDMA had no effect on the thermogenic response. In contrast, carvedilol (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) administered 15 mins before or after MDMA prevented this hyperthermic response. Moreover, when administered 1 hr after MDMA, carvedilol completely reversed established hyperthermia and significantly attenuated subsequent MDMA-induced creatine kinase release.
These data show that alpha1 and beta3-adrenergic receptors may contribute to the mediation of MDMA-induced hyperthermia and that drugs targeting these receptors, such as carvedilol, warrant further investigation as novel therapies for the treatment of psychostimulant-induced hyperthermia and its sequelae.
The ability of sulfhydryl compounds to provide protection against the acute toxicity of codeinone, a toxic metabolite of codeine, was investigated in mice. Subcutaneous administration of codeinone produced a slight reduction in hepatic glutathione concentration. Pretreatment of the mice with glutathione or cysteine significantly increased the survival rate for mice given a lethal dose of codeinone (10 mg/kg). The lethality of codeine was lowered by naloxone, whereas that of codeinone was not blocked by naloxone. The strychnine-like convulsant action of codeinone could be prevented by phenobarbital pretreatment. Glutathione pretreatment reduced the amounts of radioactivity in tissues of mice injected with [N-methyl-3-H]codeinone. A possible explanation for these observations is that glutathione reacts in vivo with codeinone and plays a role as a scavenger of this compound. This assumption is supported by the observation that codeinone reacts non-enzymatically with glutathione under physiological conditions.
Activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) is known to be related to elevated blood pressure in hyperinsulinemia. We previously demonstrated that a fructose-enriched diet induced hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia, elevated NHE activity, increased intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), and increased blood pressure in borderline hypertensive rats (BHR). This study examines whether pharmacologically reducing plasma triglyceride or insulin concentrations lowers blood pressure and reduces NHE activity in fructose-fed BHR. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), bezafibrate (BEZ), and troglitazone (TRO) were administered to treat hypertriglyceridemia and/or hyperinsulinemia. Rats were fed a 60% fructose diet or a control diet for 4 weeks, followed by a diet with either vehicle, EPA, BEZ, or TRO for 4 weeks. Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured in platelets by fluorescent dye. Platelet NHE activity was evaluated by the recovery of pHi following addition of sodium propionate (Vmax). [Ca2+]i in platelets were measured fluorometrically. In fructose-fed rats, EPA prevented further increase in blood pressure, and reduced triglyceride concentration and [Ca2+]i without affecting Vmax or plasma insulin concentrations. BEZ reduced triglyceride concentrations without affecting blood pressure, Vmax, [Ca2+]i, or insulin concentrations. TRO prevented an increase in blood pressure, and reduced Vmax, [Ca2+]i, and insulin, but not triglycerides. Plasma insulin and Vmax were positively correlated. In conclusion, improvement of hyperinsulinemia can decrease NHE activity and blood pressure in fructose-fed BHR.
A 59-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) had a white-blood-cell (WBC) count of 55,400/microliter when admitted in July 1997, and was placed on oral hydroxyurea (HU) of 1,500 mg/day. Treatment with 600 MU/day of interferon alpha (IFN alpha) was started on August 5. HU was discontinued when the patient's WBC count dropped to 8,100/microliter on August 18. However, HU was resumed about a month later, after his WBC count increased to 10,100/microliter, but discontinued when the patient started to complain of chills, high fever, and bilateral femoral pain. HU treatment was initiated again one week later, after the patient's WBC count had begun rising but ceased again after he experienced chills, high fever, and bilateral femoral pain. The patient's myogenetic enzymes were found to be increasing the following day, and a lymphocyte stimulation test (LST) with HU showed a high stimulation index of 41.7%. The elevation of myogenetic enzymes and the results of the LST suggested that myositis due to HU was the cause of the patient's clinical manifestations. His myositis spontaneously disappeared after HU was discontinued. Although the patient is no longer receiving HU, IFN alpha has brought his CML under control. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of myositis caused by HU.
To evaluate the therapeutic effect of Chunggan extract (CGX), a modified traditional Chinese hepatotherapeutic herbal, on the dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced chronic liver injury model in rats.
Liver injuries were induced in Wistar rats by injection of DMN (ip, 10 mg/mL per kg) for 3 consecutive days per week for 4 wk. The rats were administered with CGX (po, 100 or 200 mg/kg per day) or distilled water as a control daily for 4 wk starting from the 15(th) d of the DMN treatment. Biochemical parameters (serum albumin, bilirubin, ALP, AST and ALT), lipid peroxides, hydroxyproline, as well as histological changes in liver tissues were analyzed. In addition, gene expression of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, PDGF-beta, and MMP-2, all of which are known to be associated with liver fibrosis, were analyzed using real-time PCR.
CGX administration restored the spleen weight to normal after having been increased by DMN treatment. Biochemical analysis of the serum demonstrated that CGX significantly decreased the serum level of ALP (P < 0.05), ALT (P < 0.01), and AST (P < 0.01) that had been elevated by DMN treatment. CGX administration moderately lowered lipid peroxide production and markedly lowered hydroxyproline generation caused by DMN treatment in accordance with histopathological examination. DMN treatment induced a highly up-regulated expression of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, PDGF-beta, and MMP-2. Of these, the gene expression encoding PDGF-beta and MMP-2 was still further enhanced 2 wk after secession of the 4-wk DMN treatment, and was remarkably ameliorated by CGX administration.
CGX exhibits hepatotherapeutic proper-ties against chronic hepatocellular destruction and consequential liver fibrosis.
In the current study, cross state-dependent learning between the cannabinoid CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN55, 212-2 (WIN) and muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (SCO) in a step-through inhibitory avoidance task was investigated. All drugs were injected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus (intra-CA1) of rats. Data indicated that the immediate post-training administration of WIN (0.25 and 0.5μg/rat) and SCO (2 and 4μg/rat) decreased memory consolidation and induced amnesia. Moreover, the amnesia induced by the post-training injections of WIN (0.5μg/rat) or SCO (2μg/rat) was restored by either pre-test injections of WIN (0.25 and 0.5μg/rat) or SCO (2 and 4μg/rat). Furthermore, pre-test co-administration of ineffective doses of WIN (0.1μg/rat) with SCO (1μg/rat) restored amnesia induced by the post-training injections of WIN (0.5μg/rat) or SCO (2μg/rat). In conclusion, the data strongly revealed a cross state-dependent learning between WIN and SCO in the rat dorsal hippocampus.
The time course and concentration-effect relationship of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia was studied, using computer-aided pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling. Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of oxprenolol in antagonizing such hypokalemia, together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs. Six healthy subjects were given a 0.5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline on two occasions: 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg oxprenolol orally. In the 7-hour period after terbutaline administration, plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma potassium levels and drug concentrations. The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between terbutaline concentrations and potassium effects. Oxprenolol caused decreases of 65% and 56% of terbutaline volume of distribution and clearance, respectively, and an increase of 130% of its AUC. In spite of higher terbutaline concentrations after oxprenolol pretreatment, the hypokalemia was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2-blocking action.
The role of dopamine in cocaine abuse has been long recognized. Cocaine use can profoundly alter dopaminergic functioning through depletion of this monoamine and changes in receptor functioning. Based on these facts, levodopa (L-dopa) pharmacotherapy may be helpful in reducing or abolishing cocaine use.
The current studies sought to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of L-dopa as a treatment for cocaine dependence.
In Study 1, 67 cocaine-dependent subjects were randomized in a 5-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety trial. Subjects received either placebo, or 400 mg L-dopa plus 100 mg of the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa, in a sustained-release preparation (Sinemet CR). In Study 2, 122 cocaine-dependent subjects were enrolled in a 9-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare placebo to 400/100 mg and 800/200 mg L-dopa/carbidopa treatments. Placebo or L-dopa were administered twice daily in both studies.
L-dopa was well tolerated with similar retention and medication adherence rates compared to placebo. Only two side effects occurred more often in L-dopa-treated patients: nausea and dizziness. L-dopa lowered diastolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. In these trials, L-dopa had no effect on cocaine use, cocaine craving, or mood.
These two studies demonstrate the safety and tolerability of L-dopa pharmacotherapy in cocaine-dependent patients. No evidence for greater efficacy of L-dopa compared to placebo was observed. The possibility of enhancing treatment effects by combining L-dopa with other behavioral or pharmacological interventions is discussed.
Responses to intravenous clonidine, a possible central noradrenergic probe, were examined in patients with depression before and after treatment with clorgiline, a selective monoamine oxidase type A inhibitor. Pulse rate, mean arterial blood pressure, plasma norepinephrine, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, and growth hormone were measured. Clorgiline treatment (2.5 to 10 mg/day) produced a variable reduction in the hypotensive response to clonidine but did not influence heart rate or plasma norepinephrine responses. Clorgiline markedly reduced the urinary output of norepinephrine and metabolites, indicating a reduced turnover of norepinephrine. None of the measured parameters corresponded with clinical effect. These data suggest that any clorgiline-induced alterations in alpha 2-receptor function as measured by responses to clonidine are modest and highly variable. Furthermore, since the variable and inconsistent changes in alpha 2-receptor function are dissociated from the massive changes in norepinephrine metabolism, regulation of presynaptic alpha 2-receptors appears unlikely to mediate the effects of clorgiline in patients with depression.
Heart failure is correlated with attenuation of parasympathetic nervous function and enhanced sympathetic activity. Carvedilol, a third-generation beta-blocker, may improve the prognosis of heart failure better than selective beta(1)-blockers. Not all of its effects, however, can be explained by direct actions on the sympathetic nervous system. This study was therefore performed to investigate the possible alterations of muscarinic cholinergic (M)(2) receptors and cholinesterase-positive nerves in different regions of the adriamycin-induced failing rat heart, and the potential effects of carvedilol on these M(2) receptors and cholinesterase-positive nerves. Karnovsky-Roots histochemical staining combined with point counting methods, and immunochemical streptavidin-biotin complex staining and image analysis were used to test the distribution of cholinesterase-positive nerves and the expression of M(2) receptors, respectively. Our results show that the cholinesterase-positive nerve system was downregulated in the adriamycin-induced failing heart group, while the density of M(2) receptors was increased in the carvedilol 3- and 10-mg/kg body weight groups, especially in the endocardial tissues of the left-ventricular free wall. It is concluded that upregulation of M(2) receptors may be one of the potential mechanisms by which carvedilol exert its action on heart failure.
To compare with train-of-four stimulation the delays of the beginning of the spontaneous recovery of the orbicularis oculi and of the adductor pollicis after profound neuromuscular blockade with atracurium.
Prospective, comparative open study.
Twenty-eight physical class ASA 1 and 2 patients under general anaesthesia (propofol, N2O, fentanyl) and profound neuromuscular blockade with atracurium. Train-of-four stimulation, every 10 s, of the ulnar nerve at the wrist (for assessing by tactile means the response of the adductor pollicis) and of the temporal branch of the facial nerve (for assessing visually the response of the orbicularis oculi). On each site, measurement of the delay between the end of the maintenance of deep neuromuscular blockade (last dose of atracurium) and the beginning of the recovery (first response to train-of-four stimulation).
In each case, the recovery of the orbicularis oculi began earlier than the recovery of the adductor pollicis (26 +/- 9 min vs 34 +/- 9 min, P < 0.001). The delays of recovery at each site were strongly correlated (r = 0.87; P < 0.001) but the time lag between the responses varied greatly: 1 to 21 min, mean: 8 +/- 5 min, coefficient of variation: 56.6%.
The orbicularis oculi should not be monitored alone for assessment of recovery from profound neuromuscular blockade by atracurium, as it predicts poorly the time of the recovery of the adductor pollicis.
The experiment was carried out on male Wistar rats weighing 180-220 g with lesion in the cortex of the frontal lobe. The activity of the dopaminergic system was studied by means of behavioural tests such as determination of spontaneous motor activity, apomorphine-induced stereotypy, haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Increased intensity of stereotypy was observed reaching a maximum 14 days after frontal lobe damage. Moreover, a slight tendency was observed for inhibition of haloperidol-induced catalepsy without changes in the spontaneous motor activity of the animals. Biochemical investigations demonstrated reduced dopamine content in the striatum on the side of the lesion.
Tobacco products are potentially hazardous to children. Small oral doses may create marked toxic effects. Physicians treating children with gastrointestinal complaints, altered consciousness, and seizure with depressed respiration should seek a history of possible exposure to tobacco products, including gum used for smoking abstinence. Intoxication can be verified by a urine toxicology screen utilizing chromatography.
Oxidative stress and inflammation have been implicated in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and complication of diabetes. The present study was designed to evaluate whether resveratrol has cerebroprotective action through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions in diabetic rats. Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (30 min) and reperfusion (4 h) was employed to induce cerebral infarction in diabetic Wistar rats. Diabetes was induced by streptozocine (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally at once. Diabetic animals were divided into groups as: normal, sham, ischemia-reperfusion, and resveratrol-treated (5, 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg). These were used for estimation of cerebral infarction. Furthermore, 20 mg/kg dose was selected for estimation of oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and catalase). Inflammatory markers like TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and myeloperoxidase were estimated and histological characters were studied. Resveratrol produced dose-dependent reduction in percent cerebral infarction. With resveratrol of 20 mg/kg dose, levels of oxidative stress markers and inflammatory markers like malondialdehyde, TNF-α, IL-6, and myeloperoxidase were reduced and there was a significant increase in the levels of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory markers like catalase, superoxide dismutase, and IL-10. In the present study, we found that mechanism(s) responsible for the cerebroprotective effect of resveratrol in the diabetic rat brain involves antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.
A lifetime history of analgesics and tobacco consumption was obtained by a questionnaire completed at interview from 67 patients with carcinoma of the renal pelvis (40 women, 27 men) and 180 control subjects drawn from two sources, friends of patients and persons attending a health screening clinic. Regular consumption of analgesics conferred a tenfold relative risk of renal pelvic cancer in women and in men a risk ratio of 4-8. The fraction of cases for which analgesic consumption was an attributable risk was 0.74 in women and 0.43 in men. The effect of tobacco, much less than that of analgesics, was significant only in women (risk ratio approximately four; attributable risk 0.4), and no dose-response relationship was demonstrated. Relative excess risks suggested a synergistic effect when both analgesics and tobacco had been consumed. Standardized risk ratios indicated a dose-response relationship for both phenacetin-containing and non-phenacetin analgesics: moderate consumption doubled the risk of renal pelvic cancer, and heavy consumption increased at risk to 6-16 times that for noncomsumers.
To test the efficacy of sustained nicotine patch use among at-risk smokers, 55 smokers with a history of abstinence-induced depressed mood were randomly assigned to either Nicotine Maintenance or Standard Treatment following preliminary high-dose patch treatment. The Nicotine Maintenance group received 21 mg transdermal nicotine for 8 additional weeks; the Standard Treatment group followed a tapered dosing regimen. Significant differences favoring the Nicotine Maintenance group were found in self-reported craving but not withdrawal. No difference was observed in continuous abstinence or in relapse rates. When dropouts who did not relapse during patch use were classified as successful, however, the Nicotine Maintenance group had significantly lower relapse rates. Rate of lapse in the Nicotine Maintenance group during post-trial tapering did not differ significantly from that in the Standard Treatment group during tapering in the trial, suggesting that the benefits of sustained dosing may persist only as long as dosing continues.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) content is increased in many types of tumor cells. We have investigated the mechanism by which resveratrol, a stilbene that is pro-apoptotic in many tumor cell lines, causes apoptosis in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma UMSCC-22B cells by a mechanism involving cellular COX-2. UMSCC-22B cells treated with resveratrol for 24 h, with or without selected inhibitors, were examined: (1) for the presence of nuclear activated ERK1/2, p53 and COX-2, (2) for evidence of apoptosis, and (3) by chromatin immunoprecipitation to demonstrate p53 binding to the p21 promoter. Stilbene-induced apoptosis was concentration-dependent, and associated with ERK1/2 activation, serine-15 p53 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of these proteins. These effects were blocked by inhibition of either ERK1/2 or p53 activation. Resveratrol also caused p53 binding to the p21 promoter and increased abundance of COX-2 protein in UMSCC-22B cell nuclei. Resveratrol-induced nuclear COX-2 accumulation was dependent upon ERK1/2 activation, but not p53 activation. Activation of p53 and p53-dependent apoptosis were blocked by the COX-2 inhibitor, NS398, and by transfection of cells with COX-2-siRNA. In UMSCC-22B cells, resveratrol-induced apoptosis and induction of nuclear COX-2 accumulation share dependence on the ERK1/2 signal transduction pathway. Resveratrol-inducible nuclear accumulation of COX-2 is essential for p53 activation and p53-dependent apoptosis in these cancer cells.
Although cognition has been investigated in individuals with schizophrenia and in non-schizophrenic cocaine abusers, few studies have focused on cocaine-abusing schizophrenics. Previous studies have shown contradictory results despite the fact that individuals with schizophrenia and cocaine dependence have worse long-term outcomes, and that each disorder separately is associated with neuropsychological impairment. The present study intended to clarify these inconsistencies with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Twenty-four cocaine-dependent schizophrenics and 23 non-drug abusing schizophrenics were recruited from the VA. Participants were administered tests focusing on motor skills, processing speed, attention, concentration, and executive functioning. While individuals with schizophrenia and cocaine dependence performed worse on the Grooved Peg Board and the Stroop A, the non-drug abusing schizophrenics performed worse on Trails Part A and B. However, a MANOVA failed to show group differences in overall neuropsychological performance. These findings are similar to the existing literature and suggest that cocaine may compromise motor functioning.
The action and interaction of ACTH and prolactin in the development of fatty liver were investigated in intact rats treated with exogenous hormones. Administration of ACTH or of combinations of ACTH and GH to intact female rats was found to elicit significantly greater increase in liver total lipids content and concentration than administration of combinations of ACTH, or ACTH and GH, with prolactin. In addition, the results support the data reported by Bates et al. (6) that simultaneous application of GH, prolactin and ACTH reduces the effct of ACTH, upon adrenal gland weight.
Metamizole is one of the pyrazolone drugs used widely in Turkey. The aim of this survey was to determine the clinical features of metamizole intolerant patients and to find out if there was any difference between the ones with or without bronchial asthma.
A total of 264 patients with metamizole intolerance were enrolled in the survey. Patients having bronchial asthma were accepted as group I (n = 133) and the ones without bronchial asthma as group II (n = 131). A standard questionnaire was used to collect the data.
The mean age of the patients were 41.8 11.8 and 39.2 12.2 for groups I and II respectively and 99 (79.4 %) and 99 (75.6 %) were females in the same order. There was no significant difference between groups I and II when the rates of personal atopy, familial atopy and familial analgesic intolerance were compared. The most common reactions appearing after metamizole ingestion was bronchospasm (75.9 and 9 %) and urticaria (25.6 and 64.9 %) (for groups I and II, respectively and p < 0.05). Aspirin cross-reactivity was significantly more common in group I. At least one safe alternative analgesic was determined for all the patients who have not been able to use any analgesic.
Metamizole intolerance seems to be as important as aspirin intolerance in Turkey. The clinical features in general appear to be similar for metamizole and aspirin intolerant asthmatics.
A study was conducted to assess whether the protection afforded to organophosphatepoisoned animals by diacetylmonoxime (DAM) was correlated with the reactivation of non-essential aliesterases (AliE). In vitro, the DAM-catalyzed reactivation of plasma AliE and cholinesterases (psi ChE) of rat, rabbit and guinea pig inhibited by 10-5 M diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) and O,O-dimethyl-2,2-dichlorovinyl phosphate (DDVP) was investigated. Marked reactivation of the rat plasma enzymes was achieved with 10mM DAM. Higher concentrations (30 mM) were necessary for the slow reactivation of rabbit and guinea pig plasma AliE. Reactivation of the psiChE of these species was comparatively slow. Reactivation of DDVP-inhibited esterases proceeded in all species at a more rapid rate than those inhibited by DFP. The dependence of psiChE reactivation upon concomitant more rapid reactivation of AliE by DAM was demonstrated using Sephadex fractionated AliE and psiChE but only a marked effect was observed with the rat, suggesting that the plasma AliE of this species is functionally different. The in vitro observations were confirmed by in vivo studies in rats and rabbits. DAM (50 or 150 mg/kg), administered to atropinized rats 15 min before a lethal dose of DFP, protected the animals. Few severe toxic signs were observed and reactivation of both plasma AliE and psiChE occurred. In contrast, DAM protected the rabbit against a lethal dose of DFP but only reactivation of the erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase was observed.
