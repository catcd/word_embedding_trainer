All affected patients in four families with autosomal dominant familial renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) were heterozygous for mutations in their red cell HCO3-/Cl- exchanger, band 3 (AE1, SLC4A1) genes, and these mutations were not found in any of the nine normal family members studied. The mutation Arg589--> His was present in two families, while Arg589--> Cys and Ser613--> Phe changes were found in the other families. Linkage studies confirmed the co-segregation of the disease with a genetic marker close to AE1. The affected individuals with the Arg589 mutations had reduced red cell sulfate transport and altered glycosylation of the red cell band 3 N-glycan chain. The red cells of individuals with the Ser613--> Phe mutation had markedly increased red cell sulfate transport but almost normal red cell iodide transport. The erythroid and kidney isoforms of the mutant band 3 proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and all showed significant chloride transport activity. We conclude that dominantly inherited dRTA is associated with mutations in band 3; but both the disease and its autosomal dominant inheritance are not related simply to the anion transport activity of the mutant proteins.
Drugs differentially affecting catecholaminergic neurotransmission mechanisms were injected into isolated mice to assess effects on aggression. L-DOPA in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor produced a dose-dependent decrease in the number of fights and average fight durations accompanied by an increase in attack latencies. Central dopamine levels were increased whilst brain noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine were reduced. Virtually identical effects on aggression were observed after apomorphine. Pimozide decreased fighting, but neither attack latencies nor average fight durations were effected. All doses of disulfiram virtually abolished all components of aggressive responses. The effect of D-amphetamine on number of fights was biphasic; lower doses potentiated aggression, but higher doses reduced fighting accompanied by increased attack latencies and reduced average fight durations. We conclude that catecholamines may be intimately involved in mediating certain components of aggressive responses but that balance relationships among various putative neurotransmitters may be a more meaningful correlate of this behavior.
Strategies to address resistance to platin drugs are greatly needed in human epithelial cancers (e.g., ovarian, head/neck, and lung) where platins are used widely and resistance occurs commonly. We found that upon ΔNp63α overexpression, AKT1 and phospho-AKT1 levels are upregulated in cancer cells. Investigations using gel-shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation and functional reporter assays implicated ΔNp63α in positive regulation of AKT1 transcription. Importantly, we found that ΔNp63α, AKT1, and phospho-AKT levels are greater in 2008CI3 CDDP-resistant ovarian cancer cells than in 2008 CDDP-sensitive cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of ΔNp63α expression dramatically decreased AKT1 expression, whereas knockdown of either ΔNp63α or AKT1 decreased cell proliferation and increased death of ovarian and head/neck cancer cells. Conversely, enforced expression of ΔNp63α increased cancer cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Together, our findings define a novel ΔNp63α-dependent regulatory mechanism for AKT1 expression and its role in chemotherapeutic resistance of ovarian and head/neck cancer cells.
Despite years of active research, there are still no approved medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Modafinil is a glutamate-enhancing agent that blunts cocaine euphoria under controlled conditions, and the current study assessed whether modafinil would improve clinical outcome in cocaine-dependent patients receiving standardized psychosocial treatment. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at a university outpatient center (from 2002 to 2003) on a consecutive sample of 62 (predominantly African American) cocaine-dependent patients (aged 25-63) free of significant medical and psychiatric conditions. After screening, eligible patients were randomized to a single morning dose of modafinil (400 mg), or matching placebo tablets, for 8 weeks while receiving manual-guided, twice-weekly cognitive behavioral therapy. The primary efficacy measure was cocaine abstinence based on urine benzoylecgonine levels. Secondary measures were craving, cocaine withdrawal, retention, and adverse events. Modafinil-treated patients provided significantly more BE-negative urine samples (p=0.03) over the 8-week trial when compared to placebos, and were more likely to achieve a protracted period (> or =3 weeks) of cocaine abstinence (p=0.05). There were no serious adverse events, and none of the patients failed to complete the study as a result of adverse events. This study provides preliminary evidence, which should be confirmed by a larger study, that modafinil improves clinical outcome when combined with psychosocial treatment for cocaine dependence.
Our aim was to investigate postoperative complications and mortality after administration of aprotinin compared to tranexamic acid in an unselected, consecutive cohort.
Perioperative data from consecutive cardiac surgery patients were prospectively collected between September 2005 and June 2006 in a university-affiliated clinic (n = 1188). During the first 5 mo, 596 patients received aprotinin (Group A); in the next 5 mo, 592 patients were treated with tranexamic acid (Group T). Except for antifibrinolytic therapy, the anesthetic and surgical protocols remained unchanged.
The pre- and intraoperative variables were comparable between the treatment groups. Postoperatively, a significantly higher incidence of seizures was found in Group T (4.6% vs 1.2%, P < 0.001). This difference was also significant in the primary valve surgery and the high risk surgery subgroups (7.9% vs 1.2%, P = 0.003; 7.3% vs 2.4%, P = 0.035, respectively). Persistent atrial fibrillation (7.9% vs 2.3%, P = 0.020) and renal failure (9.7% vs 1.7%, P = 0.002) were also more common in Group T, in the primary valve surgery subgroup. On the contrary, among primary coronary artery bypass surgery patients, there were more acute myocardial infarctions and renal dysfunction in Group A (5.8% vs 2.0%, P = 0.027; 22.5% vs 15.2%, P = 0.036, respectively). The 1-yr mortality was significantly higher after aprotinin treatment in the high risk surgery group (17.7% vs 9.8%, P = 0.034).
Both antifibrinolytic drugs bear the risk of adverse outcome depending on the type of cardiac surgery. Administration of aprotinin should be avoided in coronary artery bypass graft and high risk patients, whereas administration of tranexamic acid is not recommended in valve surgery.
CD44 is highly expressed in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Some experiments had shown that it was possible to reverse differentiation blockage in AML cells by CD44 ligation with specific antibodies, indicating that CD44 was closely related to the differentiation of leukemia cells. The differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells could be induced by all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), but so far the mechanism was not demonstrated clearly. In the present study, we investigated whether ATRA or HMBA induced the growth arrest of HL-60 cells by down-regulating the expression of CD44. The results indicated that the proliferation of HL-60 cells was obviously inhibited and the differentiation was induced by both ATRA and HMBA. The decreased expression of CD44 and cyclin E mRNA, and the increased expression of p27 and p21 at mRNA levels were observed. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between the expression of CD44 and p27. It was concluded that ATRA and HMBA played a role in the differentiation induction of HL-60 cells, which was mediated by the down-regulation of CD44, accompanied by down-regulation of cyclin E, and up-regulation of p27 and p21 mRNA.
Therapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases have shown efficacy in molecularly defined subsets of cancers. Unfortunately, cancers invariably develop resistance, and overcoming or preventing resistance will ultimately be key to unleashing their full therapeutic potential. In this study, we examined how cancers become resistant to MET inhibitors, a class of drugs currently under clinical development. We utilized the highly sensitive gastric carcinoma cell line, SNU638, and two related MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF-2341066. To our surprise, we observed at least two mechanisms of resistance that arose simultaneously. Both resulted in maintenance of downstream PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-AKT and MEK (MAP/ERK kinase)-ERK signaling in the presence of inhibitor. One mechanism, observed by modeling resistance both in vitro and in vivo, involved the acquisition of a mutation in the MET activation loop (Y1230). Structural analysis indicates that this mutation destabilizes the autoinhibitory conformation of MET and abrogates an important aromatic stacking interaction with the inhibitor. The other cause of resistance was activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway due to increased expression of transforming growth factor α. Activation of EGFR bypassed the need for MET signaling to activate downstream signaling in these cells. This resistance could be overcome by combined EGFR and MET inhibition. Thus, therapeutic strategies that combine MET inhibitors capable of inhibiting Y1230 mutant MET in combination with anti-EGFR-based therapies may enhance clinical benefit for patients with MET-addicted cancers. Importantly, these results also underscore the notion that a single cancer can simultaneously develop resistance induced by several mechanisms and highlight the daunting challenges associated with preventing or overcoming resistance.
Previous reports have suggested that IDPN may be ototoxic (Wolff et al., 1977; Crofton and Knight, 1991). The purpose of this research was to investigate the ototoxicity of IDPN using behavioral, physiological and morphological approaches. Three groups of adult rats were exposed to IDPN (0-400 mg/kg/day) for three consecutive days. In the first group, at 9-10 weeks post-exposure, thresholds for hearing of 5.3- and 38-kHz filtered clicks were measured electrophysiologically and brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs) were also recorded to a suprathreshold broadband click stimulus. A second set of animals was tested at 9 weeks for behavioral hearing thresholds (0.5- to 40-kHz tones) and at 11-12 weeks post-exposure for BAER thresholds (5- to 80-kHz filtered clicks). A third group of animals was exposed (as above), and killed at 12-14 weeks post-exposure for histological assessment. Kanamycin sulfate was used as a positive control for high-frequency selective hearing loss. Surface preparations of the organ of Corti were prepared in order to assess hair cells, and mid-modiolar sections of the cochlea were used to examine Rosenthal's canal and the stria vascularis. Functional data demonstrate a broad-spectrum hearing loss ranging from 0.5 kHz (30 dB deficit) to 80 kHz (40 dB deficit), as compared to a hearing deficit in kanamycin-exposed animals that was only apparent at frequencies greater than 5 kHz. Surface preparations revealed IDPN-induced hair cell loss in all turns of the organ of Corti, with a basal-to-apical gradient (more damage in the basal turns) at the lower dosages. At higher dosages there was complete destruction of the organ of Corti. There was also a dosage-related loss of spiral ganglion cells in all turns of the cochlea, again with a basal-to-apical gradient at the lower dosages. These data demonstrate that IDPN exposure in the rat results in extensive hearing loss and loss of neural structures in the cochlea.
Doxorubicin containing combination chemotherapy regimens are widely used for treatment of breast and other cancers. However, these regimens are associated with significant toxicities including myocardial dysfunction and alopecia. Analogues of doxorubicin are being developed to reduce these side effects. We conducted a Phase II trial of an anthracycline analogue, pirarubicin, administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks, as front-line chemotherapy in women with metastatic breast cancer. Patients who had received prior anthracycline therapy were excluded. The chemotherapy doses were as follows: 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8), pirarubicin (50 mg/m2 on day 1), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 on day 1). Among 40 evaluable patients treated on this protocol, a major response (partial or complete remission) was observed in 26 patients (response rate, 62%; 95% confidence interval, 46-77). The median response duration was 8 months, and median survival was 16 months. Grade III/IV myelosuppression occurred in 81% of the courses. The median cumulative pirarubicin dose was 410 (range, 90-870) mg/m2. A significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction occurred in 12 patients (at a median cumulative pirarubicin dose of 460 mg/m2) and led to congestive heart failure in 4 of these patients (cumulative pirarubicin doses of 500, 520, 590, and 730 mg/m2, respectively). Eleven patients underwent endomyocardial biopsy, either because they experienced a drop in left ventricular ejection fraction or because they had received a cumulative pirarubicin dose of 600 mg/m2 and were still responding to the treatment. Of these, only one biopsy was found to be more than grade 1.0 (in an individual who had received a cumulative dose of 705 mg/m2). Severe alopecia occurred in two-thirds of the patients. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a triphasic elimination of pirarubicin with alpha, beta and gamma half-lives of 0.12, 1.44, and 33.9 h, respectively. Total clearance of drug was 4.2 liters.1 h/kg while the cumulative 24-h urinary excretion was less than 10% of the administered dose. The activity of the combination appears to be similar to doxorubicin-containing regimens, while the incidence of alopecia appears to be lower than the historical experience with doxorubicin. However, cardiotoxicity remains a significant problem.
We investigated the antioxidant preventive effect of betaine on isoprenaline-induced myocardial infarction in male albino rats. Isoprenaline induced myocardial infarction was manifested by a moderate elevation in the levels of diagnostic marker enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase) and homocysteine in plasma of experimental rats. Significant rise in the level of lipid peroxidation with a concomitant decline in the levels of myocardial non-enzymic (reduced glutathione) and enzymic antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, catalase and superoxide dismutase) was also observed. Oral pretreatment with betaine significantly prevented isoprenaline-induced alterations in the levels of diagnostic marker enzymes and homocysteine in plasma of experimental groups of rats. It counteracted the isoprenaline-induced lipid peroxidation and maintained the myocardial antioxidant defense system at near normal. Histopathological observations also confirmed the protective effect of betaine against isoprenaline-induced myocardial infarction. The results of the present investigation indicate that the protective effect of betaine is probably related to its ability to strengthen the myocardial membrane by its membrane stabilizing action or to a counteraction of free radicals by its antioxidant property.
The accuracy of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been yet evaluated in women. We studied the effect of gender on the accuracy of DSE for the diagnosis of CAD in 306 consecutive patients (210 men and 96 women) with limited exercise capacity and suspected myocardial ischemia who underwent coronary angiography within 3 months of DSE. There were no serious complications during DSE. Men had a higher prevalence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (7% vs 0.03%, p <0.05) and supraventricular tachycardia (9% vs 0.03%, p <0.05) during the test compared with women. Peak stress rate-pressure product was not different in men and women (18,140 +/- 4,187 vs 18,543 +/- 4,223). Significant CAD (> or =50% luminal diameter stenosis) was present in 171 men (81%) and in 62 women (65%, p <0.005). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ischemic pattern at DSE for the diagnosis of significant CAD were 76% (confidence interval [CI] 67 to 84), 94% (CI 89 to 99), and 82% (CI 75 to 90) in women and 73% (CI 67 to 79), 77% (CI 71 to 83), and 74% (CI 68 to 80) in men, respectively. Overall specificity was higher in women than in men (p <0.05). Regional accuracy of DSE was significantly higher in women than in men in the 3 arterial regions (84% [CI 79 to 88] vs 75% [CI 72 to 79], p <0.005). It is concluded that DSE is a safe and feasible method for the diagnosis of CAD in women. The overall specificity and the regional accuracy of DSE are higher in women than in men. Further studies are required to evaluate the functional significance of these findings and their reproducibility in different patient populations.
Acute pustular psoriasis is characterized by fiery-red erythema followed by formation of pustules. Precipitating factors include drugs, infections, pregnancy, solar irradiation, and psychological stress. We present a case of a woman who developed acute onset of pustular psoriasis precipitated by hydroxychloroquine therapy and systemic steroids. The patient's course was complicated by leukocytoclastic vasculitis presumptively caused by levofloxacin.
Caveolin-1 displays both tumour-suppressor and tumour-promoter properties in breast cancer. Using characterised preclinical cell models for the transition of oestrogen-sensitive (WT-MCF-7 cells) to a tamoxifen-resistant (TAM-R cells) phenotype we examined the role caveolin-1 in the development of hormone-resistant breast cancer. The WT-MCF-7 cells showed abundant expression of caveolin-1 which potentiated oestrogen-receptor (ERalpha) signalling and promoted cell growth despite caveolin-1 mediating inhibition of ERK signalling. In TAM-R cells caveolin-1 expression was negligible, repressed by EGF-R/ERK signalling. Pharmacological inhibition of EGFR/ERK in TAM-R cells restored caveolin-1 and also resulted in the emergence of pools of phosphorylated caveolin-1. WT-MCF-7 cells exposed to tamoxifen for upto 12 weeks displayed increased caveolin-1 (peaking by week 2) followed (after week 8) by a marked decrease as the cells progress to develop a stable tamoxifen-resistant phenotype. The targeted down-regulation (siRNA) of caveolin-1 in WT-MCF-7 cells reduced growth but did not affect their sensitivity to tamoxifen, suggesting loss of caveolin-1 alone is not sufficient to confer tamoxifen-resistance. Hyperactivation of EGFR/ERK is a feature of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, a principal driver of cell growth. Recombinant expression of caveolin-1 in TAM-R cells did not affect EGFR/ERK activity, potentially due to mislocalisation of caveolin-1 through hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway or altered caveolin-1 phosphorylation. This work defines a novel role for caveolin-1 with implications for the clinical course of breast cancer and identifies caveolin-1 as a potential drug target for the treatment of early oestrogen-dependent breast cancers. Further, the loss of caveolin-1 may have benefit as a molecular signature for tamoxifen resistance.
Chronic inflammation of the urinary bladder generates hyperalgesia and allodynia. Growing evidence suggests a role of ERK in mediating somatic and visceral pain processing. In the present studies, we characterized and compared the activation of two ERK isoforms, ERK1/2 and ERK5, in micturition pathways, including the urinary bladder, lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and spinal cord in adult female and male rats before and after cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced bladder inflammation. Results showed differential activation of ERK1/2 and ERK5 in these regions following cystitis. The level of phospho-ERK1/2 but not phospho-ERK5 was increased in the urinary bladder; the level of phospho-ERK5 but not phospho-ERK1/2 was increased in DRG; and the level of phospho-ERK1/2 but not phospho-ERK5 was increased in lumbar spinal cord following cystitis compared with control. Cystitis-induced upregulation of phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK5 was time dependent and showed similar patterns in female and male rats. The level of phospho-ERK1/2 in bladder was increased at 2 and 8 h after CYP injection; the level of phospho-ERK5 in DRG was increased at 8 and 48 h after CYP injection; and the level of phospho-ERK1/2 in lumbar spinal cord was increased at 48 h after CYP injection. The result that phospho-ERK5 was exclusively increased in DRG neurons, while phospho-ERK1/2 was increased in the spinal cord and the urinary bladder after cystitis, suggests a region-specific effect of neurotrophins on micturition pathways following bladder inflammation.
Patients taking hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are at risk of developing classic bull's eye maculopathy. Currently, the standard Amsler grid (AG) is one of the most useful methods to identify such lesions. However, AG is a suprathreshold target and may not detect relative central scotomas. The aim of this study was to determine if the threshold Amsler grid (TAG) test, which varies light transmission through two cross polarising filters, allows increased detection of scotomas caused by HCQ toxicity.
56 rheumatological patients taking HCQ and 12 similar patients not taking HCQ were tested by AG, red Amsler grid (RAG), and TAG.
No scotomas were observed in patients never treated with HCQ. Among patients who had been treated with HCQ, AG revealed scotomas in two of 56 (3.64%) patients; in contrast, six (10.7%) and 37 (66.1%) scotomas were identified by RAG and TAG testing respectively. Additionally, the average area of each scotoma detected by all three methods expanded from 34.5 square degrees of central field loss on AG testing to 71 square degrees on RAG and 117 on TAG.
By decreasing the perceived luminance of the suprathreshold AG, TAG testing provides a novel alternative to detect shallow scotomas and areas of depressed retinal activity secondary to HCQ toxicity.
One hundred forty-three patients with refractory cancer were treated with intensive BCNU (600-2850 mg/m2) and autologous marrow transplantation to determine the maximum tolerated dose and antitumor effects of this regimen. Recovery from severe pancytopenia in less than 4 weeks after transplantation occurred in 92.8% of evaluable patients, suggesting the efficacy of the autologous marrow in limiting the prolonged myelosuppression anticipated with intensive BCNU. Serious extramedullary toxicity was encountered at BCNU 1200 mg/m2, where a 9.5% incidence of fatal interstitial pneumonitis and a 3.0% incidence of fatal hepatic necrosis was observed. Higher BCNU doses, 1500 to 2850 mg/m2, were associated with a 35.3% incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity. Fatal encephalomyelopathy was encountered in two patients given BCNU 2250 and 2850 mg/m2. One patient who received the highest cumulative dose of BCNU (3450 mg/m2 in 2 courses) died of cardiac necrosis. Other serious extramedullary toxicities were not encountered, even in the 14 patients who survived from 1 to nearly 5 years after BCNU therapy. Antitumor responses occurred in 40.0% of evaluable patients; a dose effect could not be evaluated due to patient heterogeneity. The BCNU doses associated with acceptable toxicity, 600 to 1200 mg/m2, produced a 37.5% total and an 11.3% complete response (CR) rate, including five patients with prolonged CRs of 1 to nearly 5 years. Notable among the CRs was the 25.0% CR rate in previously untreated metastatic melanoma, and the production of CRs in malignant disease in the central nervous system (CNS) including melanoma, lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, acute leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme. It is concluded that augmented doses of BCNU can be given when autologous marrow transplantation is used to limit myelosuppression. Lung and liver toxicity prevent the use of BCNU doses greater than 1200 mg/m2; neurotoxicity, and perhaps cardiotoxicity, are manifestations of the highest doses used in this study. The antitumor activity of BCNU 600 to 1200 mg/m2 remains to be determined for most neoplasms; these results suggest improved results in melanoma and CNS malignancy compared to conventional-dose BCNU therapy.
Exposure to high concentrations of hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) in drinking water is reported to induce oral mucosa tumors in F344 rats and intestinal tumors in B6C3F1 mice. To investigate the modes of action underlying these tumors, 90-day drinking water studies (with interim necropsy at day 8) were conducted with concentrations of 0.1-182 mg/l Cr(VI), administered as 0.3-520 mg/l sodium dichromate dihydrate. Blood and tissue samples were analyzed for chromium content, oxidative stress, iron levels, and gross and microscopic lesions. Results for the F344 rats are described herein and compared with results from B6C3F1 mice published previously. After 90 days of exposure, total chromium concentrations in the rat and mouse oral mucosae were comparable, yet significant dose-dependent decreases in the reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) were observed only in rats. In the duodenum, changes in GSH/GSSG were only observed in mice. Levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine were not increased in the oral or duodenal mucosae of either species. Glutathione levels were increased in the duodenum but decreased in the jejunum of both species, indicating potential differential responses in the intestinal segments. Histiocytic infiltration was observed in the duodenum of both species, yet duodenal cytokines were repressed in mice but increased in rats. Serum and bone marrow iron levels were more decreased in rats than mice. Collectively, these data suggest that Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis in the rodent alimentary canal involves oxidative stress; however, differences in histopathology, cytokines, and iron status suggest potential contributions from other factors as well.
Iron overload has been shown to enhance chemically mediated cutaneous tumor promotion in animals. However, the majority of these animal studies have used high concentrations of iron before initiating tumor development. The current study was designed to evaluate the effect of small doses of iron on the promotion stage of chemically mediated cutaneous carcinogenesis. We found an increased tumor response in mice initiated with dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) when iron at the dose levels of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5mg/mouse was injected (intramuscularly) once a week into mice at the promotion stage of skin carcinogenesis, employing 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)/benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as tumor promoter. The appearance of first papilloma and the number of tumors/mouse were recorded weekly. When compared to the control (non-iron-treated) group, the iron-treated groups showed an augmented incidence of tumors and number of tumors/mouse. In iron-treated mice, tumors appeared earlier than in the control group. TPA/BPO treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and depletion in the level of epidermal reduced glutathione (GSH). TPA treatment in non-iron-treated mice resulted in approximately 20-40% decrease in GSH level and in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, whereas 1.5-mg iron treatment along with TPA treatment resulted in about approximately 30-70% decrease in GSH level and in the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Similarly, treatment of iron along with BPO treatment resulted in a dose-dependent higher depletion of GSH and the antioxidant enzymes as compared to non-iron-treated animals treated with BPO. Further, TPA/BPO-mediated induction in ornithine decarboxylase activity and [3H]thymidine incorporation in cutaneous DNA was approx two- to threefold higher in mice treated with iron as compared to non-iron-treated mice. Cutaneous lipid peroxidation and iron levels were also higher in mice treated with iron as compared to non-iron-treated mice. These data suggest that progressive iron overload can enhance the tumor promotion ability of TPA/BPO in DMBA-initiated murine skin.
A case of Goodpasture's syndrome with a negative immunofluorescence examination of the lung biopsy in a 32-year-old man is described. The patient was a 40 cigarettes per day smoker, who had been smoking cocaine (crack) up to 3 weeks before hospital admission. He developed a diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with extremely acute respiratory distress, followed by renal failure with anuria. Transjugular renal biopsy, immunofluorescence and serum antiglomerular basement membrane antibody titer studies confirmed the diagnosis of Goodpasture's syndrome without linear immunoglobulin G deposits as determined by immunofluorescence examination of the alveolar basement membranes. The case illustrates the potentially complex interrelations between an autoimmune disease and exposure to substances with possible antigenic properties, besides the imperative necessity for an early, accurate diagnosis and treatment for the potential for threatening life. Moreover, the association of Goodpasture's syndrome with crack has not been previously reported.
Pituitary tumors account for 15% of intracranial neoplasms, however the extent to which environmental toxicants contribute to the proliferation and hormone expression of pituitary cells is unknown. Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) interacting protein (AIP) loss of function mutations cause somatotrope and lactotrope adenomas in humans. AIP sequesters AhR and inhibits its transcriptional function. Because of the link between AIP and pituitary tumors, we hypothesize that exposure to dioxins, potent exogenous ligands for AhR that are persistent in the environment, may predispose to pituitary dysfunction through activation of AhR. In the present study, we examined the effect of AhR activation on proliferation and endogenous pituitary hormone expression in the GH3 rat somatolactotrope tumor cell line and the effect of loss of AhR action in knockout mice. GH3 cells respond to nM doses of the reversible AhR agonist β-naphthoflavone with a robust induction of Cyp1a1. Although mRNA levels of the anti-proliferative signaling cytokine TGFbeta1 are suppressed upon β-naphthoflavone treatment, we did not observe an alteration in cell proliferation. AhR activation with β-naphthoflavone suppresses Ahr expression and impairs expression of prolactin (PRL), but not growth hormone (GH) mRNA in GH3 cells. In mice, loss of Ahr similarly leads to a reduction in Prl mRNA at P3, while Gh is unaffected. Additionally, there is a significant reduction in pituitary hormones Lhb and Fshb in the absence of Ahr. Overall, these results demonstrate that AhR is important for pituitary hormone expression and suggest that environmental dioxins can exert endocrine disrupting effects at the pituitary.
The etiology of Parkinson disease (PD) is unclear but may involve environmental toxins such as pesticides leading to dysfunction of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Here, we measured the relative toxicity of ziram (a UPS inhibitor) and analogs to dopaminergic neurons and examined the mechanism of cell death. UPS (26 S) activity was measured in cell lines after exposure to ziram and related compounds. Dimethyl- and diethyldithiocarbamates including ziram were potent UPS inhibitors. Primary ventral mesencephalic cultures were exposed to ziram, and cell toxicity was assessed by staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and NeuN antigen. Ziram caused a preferential damage to TH+ neurons and elevated alpha-synuclein levels but did not increase aggregate formation. Mechanistically, ziram altered UPS function through interfering with the targeting of substrates by inhibiting ubiquitin E1 ligase. Sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate administered to mice for 2 weeks resulted in persistent motor deficits and a mild reduction in striatal TH staining but no nigral cell loss. These results demonstrate that ziram causes selective dopaminergic cell damage in vitro by inhibiting an important degradative pathway implicated in the etiology of PD. Chronic exposure to widely used dithiocarbamate fungicides may contribute to the development of PD, and elucidation of its mechanism would identify a new potential therapeutic target.
This study was undertaken to examine the effect of fentanyl on lidocaine-induced convulsions in mice. Seventy-five male mice were used and divided into five groups, 15 in each. Convulsions were obtained by lidocaine injection subcutaneously (150 mg/kg), in a dose volume of 0.1 ml/10 g body weight over the upper back. The five groups were: (a) control group: pretreated with normal saline; (b) F50 group: pretreated with fentanyl 50 microg/kg; (c) F100 group: pretreated with fentanyl 100 microg/kg; (d) F200 group: pretreated with fentanyl 200 microg/kg, and (e) F100+N group: pretreated with fentanyl 100 mug/kg plus naloxone 1 mg/kg. The pretreatments were given intraperitoneally (i.p.) 5 min prior to lidocaine injection. After lidocaine injection, the latency to the onset of generalized convulsions was observed for 12 min and recorded. The severity of convulsions was assessed and scored as 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The recovery or death of the mice were also recorded. Student's t, Mann-Whitney U, and Fisher's exact tests were used to analyze the data. Compared with the control group (431.7 +/- 37.3 s), the latencies of onset of convulsions in the fentanyl groups were dose-dependently decreased (F50: 331.0 +/- 37.1 s; F100: 240.3 +/- 28.6 s, p < 0.001; F200: 188.7 +/- 19.4 s, p < 0.001), and the decreased latency was reversed by naloxone (F100+N: 412.9 +/- 34.1 s). Compared with the control group (1.13 +/- 0.19), the severities of convulsions in the fentanyl groups were also increased in a dose-dependent manner (F50: 1.47 +/- 0.19; F100: 1.93 +/- 0.21, p < 0.05; F200: 2.46 +/- 0.17, p < 0.001). Similarly, the increased severity was reversed by naloxone (F100+N: 1.33 +/- 0.16). There was no death in the control and naloxone-treated groups. The incidences of death were 2/15 in F50 group, 5/15 in F100 group, and 7/15 in the F200 group (p < 0.05). The results of this study demonstrated that fentanyl potentiates the lidocaine-induced convulsions in a dose-dependent manner in mice, and this effect may be mediated by an opioid mechanism.
