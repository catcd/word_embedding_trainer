Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of adult vision loss and blindness. Much of the retinal damage that characterizes the disease results from retinal vascular leakage and nonperfusion. This study shows that diabetic retinal vascular leakage and nonperfusion are temporally and spatially associated with retinal leukocyte stasis (leukostasis) in the rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Retinal leukostasis increases within days of developing diabetes and correlates with the increased expression of retinal intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). ICAM-1 blockade with a mAb prevents diabetic retinal leukostasis and vascular leakage by 48.5% and 85.6%, respectively. These data identify the causal role of leukocytes in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy and establish the potential utility of ICAM-1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for the prevention of diabetic retinopathy.
Human myeloid leukemia cells become resistant to doxorubicin (DOX) treatment and this resistance is correlated with an increased glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) expression. Troglitazone (TRG) is an anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione drug previously used to treat insulin-resistance in Type 2 diabetes. We previously showed that TRG down regulates GLO1 gene expression in a number of cell types and reasoned that TRG might be a useful adjunct therapy to overcome DOX resistance. Here we show that TRG treatment overcomes the resistance to DOX in the DOX-resistant K562 human leukemia cells. Higher doses of TRG were found to alter histone H3:H2B ratios with a decreased ratio in DOX-sensitive and increased ratio in DOX-resistant lines. Furthermore, phosphorylated H3 was seen in DOX-resistant but not in DOX-sensitive cells. We conclude that the downstream effect of TRG in DOX-resistant cells may be interference with normal cell cycle events leading to genomic instability. Our data suggest that TRG may be a useful adjunct therapy in circumventing drug resistance in K562 leukemia cells.
A prospective cohort study was conducted in 35 hospitals with oncology units to determine the incidence of symptomatic cardiotoxicity in patients receiving continuous infusions of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and to identify risk factors that could contribute to the development of 5-FU-associated cardiotoxicity. A sample of 483 patients [197 (41%) women, overall average age +/- SD 60.9 +/- 11.9 yrs] were followed for one cycle of 5-FU infusion. Thirty-eight (7.9%) patients had abrupt termination of the infusion. There were 9 (1.9%) cases of suspected or documented cardiotoxic events. Cardiotoxicity occurred in 7 (3.35%) of 209 patients receiving their first course of 5-FU and in 2 (0.73%) other patients (p=0.044). Based on univariate analysis, the following patient groups were at elevated risk of cardiotoxicity: those with preexisting cardiac disease (RR=6.83, p=0.0023); patients receiving calcium channel blockers (RR=4.75, p=0.014); those receiving nitrates (RR=9.18, p=0.007); and patients receiving concomitant etoposide (RR=10.32, p=0.022). Patients with underlying cardiac disease require close monitoring while receiving continuous infusions of 5-FU. They should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiotoxicity, and vital signs should be measured frequently. Continued reporting of 5-FU-associated cardiotoxicity is necessary to identify other patients at risk.
In order to assess the therapeutic value of 1,3 butanediol in ethylene glycol toxicosis, mixed-bred dogs were given an oral dose of commercial antifreeze at 6 ml/kg of body weight (0 hour) and treated (IV) 7 times at 6-hour intervals with 5.5 ml/kg of body weight 1,3 butanediol solution (20% in physiological saline solution) beginning at 8, 12, and 21 hours. Serum glycolic acid concentration was quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Three dogs that were given ethylene glycol, but no 1,3 butanediol treatment, died with elevated serum glycolic acid concentrations. Five dogs were given ethylene glycol and 1,3 butanediol treatment. Of 2 dogs treated at 8 hours, 1 survived and 1 died at 39 hours; 1 treated at 12 hours and 1 treated at 21 hours survived; 1 dog died soon (27 hours) after treatment was initiated at 21 hours. Four of the 5 dogs had dramatically decreased serum glycolic acid concentrations after 1,3 butanediol treatment, indicating its effectiveness in inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase-dependent glycolic acid formation in vivo.
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), oxidative damage leads to the formation of amyloid plaques while low PP2A activity results in hyperphosphorylated tau that polymerizes to form neurofibrillary tangles. We probed these early events, using brain tissue from a rat model for AD that develops memory deterioration and AD-like behaviors in old age after chronically ingesting 1.6 mg aluminum/kg bodyweight/day, equivalent to the high end of the human dietary aluminum range. A control group consumed 0.4 mg aluminum/kg/day. We stained brain sections from the cognitively-damaged rats for evidence of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, aluminum, oxidative damage, and hyperphosphorylated tau. PP2A activity levels measured 238.71+/-17.56 pmol P(i)/microg protein and 580.67+/-111.70 pmol P(i)/microg protein (p<0.05) in neocortical/limbic homogenates prepared from cognitively-damaged and control rat brains, respectively. Thus, PP2A activity in cognitively-damaged brains was 41% of control value. Staining results showed: (1) aluminum-loading occurs in some aged rat neurons as in some aged human neurons; (2) aluminum-loading in rat neurons is accompanied by oxidative damage, hyperphosphorylated tau, neuropil threads, and granulovacuolar degeneration; and (3) amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were absent from all rat brain sections examined. Known species difference can reasonably explain why plaques and tangles are unable to form in brains of genetically-normal rats despite developing the same pathological changes that lead to their formation in human brain. As neuronal aluminum can account for early stages of plaque and tangle formation in an animal model for AD, neuronal aluminum could also initiate plaque and tangle formation in humans with AD.
Anemia due to chronic disease or chemotherapy often is ameliorated by erythropoietin (Epo). Present studies reveal that, unlike steady-state erythropoiesis, erythropoiesis during anemia depends sharply on an Epo receptor-phosphotyrosine-343-Stat5 signaling axis. In mice expressing a phosphotyrosine-null (PY-null) Epo receptor allele (EpoR-HM), severe and persistent anemia was induced by hemolysis or 5-fluorouracil. In short-term transplantation experiments, donor EpoR-HM bone marrow cells also failed to efficiently repopulate the erythroid compartment. In each context, stress erythropoiesis was rescued to WT levels upon the selective restoration of an EpoR PY343 Stat5-binding site (EpoR-H allele). As studied using a unique primary culture system, EpoR-HM erythroblasts exhibited marked stage-specific losses in Epo-dependent growth and survival. EpoR-H PY343 signals restored efficient erythroblast expansion, and the selective Epo induction of the Stat5 target genes proviral integration site-1 (Pim-1) and oncostatin-M. Bcl2-like 1 (Bcl-x), in contrast, was not significantly induced via WT-EpoR, EpoR-HM, or EpoR-H alleles. In Kit+ CD71+ erythroblasts, EpoR-PY343 signals furthermore enhanced SCF growth effects, and SCF modulation of Pim-1 kinase and oncostatin-M expression. In maturing Kit- CD71+ erythroblasts, oncostatin-M exerted antiapoptotic effects that likewise depended on EpoR PY343-mediated events. Stress erythropoiesis, therefore, requires stage-specific EpoR-PY343-Stat5 signals, some of which selectively bolster SCF and oncostatin-M action.
Adenosine has no direct electrophysiologic function in ventricular tissue, but in the presence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), stimulation exerts a potent antiadrenergic effect. This effect has been exploited in the recognition and treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT) due to cAMP-mediated triggered activity and automaticity, which are respectively terminated and suppressed by adenosine. However, the effects of adenosine on catecholamine-facilitated reentrant VT are unknown. A pivotal issue is whether termination of VT with adenosine is mechanism specific, or whether it represents a nonspecific antiadrenergic effect. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to define the effects of adenosine in a well-characterized group of patients with catecholamine-facilitated reentrant VT.
Fourteen patients with catecholamine-facilitated reentry were studied. In the 12 patients with structural heart disease (including two with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia), adenosine (260 to 550 microg/kg) failed to slow or terminate VT. Two patients without structural heart disease had intrafascicular tachycardia confined to the left posterior fascicle, a calcium-dependent, verapamil-sensitive arrhythmia. In the absence of isoproterenol, verapamil terminated VT but adenosine did not. However, when isoproterenol was subsequently required for facilitation of tachycardia, adenosine terminated VT in both patients.
Adenosine has no antiadrenergic (antiarrhythmic) effect in patients with catecholamine-facilitated VT due to structural heart disease. Patients with verapamil-sensitive, left posterior intrafascicular reentry have an unusual dual response to adenosine. In the unstimulated state, adenosine has no effect on basal inward calcium current and, therefore, no effect on VT. However, when induction of VT requires amplification of the inward calcium current through stimulation of cAMP, adenosine sensitivity of VT becomes manifest. These results indicate that with few exceptions, termination of VT with adenosine is strongly suggestive of a cAMP-mediated triggered mechanism rather than reentry.
Humans exposed to excess levels of manganese (Mn(2+)) express psychiatric problems and deficits in attention and learning and memory. However, there is a paucity of knowledge on molecular mechanisms by which Mn(2+) produces such effects. We now report that Mn(2+) is a potent inhibitor of [(3)H]-MK-801 binding to the NMDA receptor channel in rat neuronal membrane preparations. The inhibition of [(3)H]-MK-801 to the NMDA receptor channel by Mn(2+) was activity-dependent since Mn(2+) was a more potent inhibitor in the presence of the NMDA receptor co-agonists glutamate and glycine (K(i)=35.9+/-3.1 microM) than in their absence (K(i)=157.1+/-6.5 microM). We also show that Mn(2+) is a NMDA receptor channel blocker since its inhibition of [(3)H]-MK-801 binding to the NMDA receptor channel is competitive in nature. That is, Mn(2+) significantly increased the affinity constant (K(d)) with no significant effect on the maximal number of [(3)H]-MK-801 binding sites (B(max)). Under stimulating conditions, Mn(2+) was equipotent in inhibiting [(3)H]-MK-801 binding to NMDA receptors expressed in neuronal membrane preparations from different brain regions. However, under basal, non-stimulated conditions, Mn(2+) was more potent in inhibiting NMDA receptors in the cerebellum than other brain regions. We have previously shown that chronic Mn(2+) exposure in non-human primates increases Cu(2+), but not zinc or iron concentrations in the basal ganglia [Guilarte TR, Chen M-K, McGlothan JL, Verina T, Wong DF, Zhou Y, Alexander M, Rohde CA, Syversen T, Decamp E, Koser AJ, Fritz S, Gonczi H, Anderson DW, Schneider JS. Nigrostriatal dopamine system dysfunction and subtle motor deficits in manganese-exposed non-human primates. Exp Neurol 2006a;202:381-90]. Therefore, we also tested the inhibitory effects of Cu(2+) on [(3)H]-MK-801 binding to the NMDA receptor channel. The data shows that Cu(2+) in the presence of glutamate and glycine is a more potent inhibitor of the NMDA receptor than Mn(2+). Our findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of Mn(2+) and/or Cu(2+) on the NMDA receptor may produce a deficit in glutamatergic transmission in the brain of individuals exposed to excess levels of Mn(2+) and produce neurological dysfunction.
Cardiac arrhythmias often occur when patients receiving aminophylline are anesthetized with halothane. This animal study was designed to define what constitute arrhythmogenic doses of aminophylline when administered before halothane anesthesia. One group of six dogs was given aminophylline, 10 mg/kg IV, followed in 3 minutes by inhalation of 1% halothane. In two additional groups of dogs the same experimental protocols were used except that aminophylline doses were 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg. In the first group, two of six dogs developed ventricular arrhythmias during induction of halothane anesthesia. One of six dogs given 25 mg/kg of aminophylline developed a ventricular arrhythmia. Three of six dogs given 50 mg/kg of aminophylline developed ventricular arrhythmias. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 33% of the animals with "therapeutic" serum theophylline levels and in 33% of the animals with "toxic" levels. Induction of halothane anesthesia within 15 minutes of aminophylline administration may be dangerous and is likely to result in severe and persistent ventricular arrhythmias.
Inherited human long-QT2 syndrome (LQTS) results from mutations in the gene encoding the HERG channel. Several LQT2-associated mutations have been mapped to the amino terminal cytoplasmic Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain of the HERG1a channel subunit. Here we have characterized the trafficking properties of some LQT2-associated PAS domain mutants and analyzed rescue of the trafficking mutants by low temperature (27°C) or by the pore blocker drug E4031. We show that the LQT2-associated mutations in the PAS domain of the HERG channel display molecular properties that are distinct from the properties of LQT2-associated mutations in the trans-membrane region. Unlike the latter, many of the tested PAS domain LQT2-associated mutations do not result in trafficking deficiency of the channel. Moreover, the majority of the PAS domain mutations that cause trafficking deficiencies are not rescued by a pore blocking drug. We have also explored the in vitro folding stability properties of isolated mutant PAS domain proteins using a thermal unfolding fluorescence assay and a chemical unfolding assay.
Sex difference in seizure susceptibility is one of the unresolved issues of epilepsy. It is known that estrogen is excitatory and progesterone is inhibitory to the central nervous system. Therefore, it is to be expected that seizure susceptibility may be associated with the estrous cycle, which should be tested in epilepsy research. Otherwise, different results in epilepsy studies could be an artifact of the estrous cycle. Reports in the literature are inconsistent about testosterone effects on seizures. In light of these considerations, sex differences in seizure susceptibility were restudied in rats. There was no significant sex difference in mean latencies to picrotoxin-induced seizures; prestrous-females had the shortest latencies to epileptic seizures compared to males and estrousfemales. With testosterone-injected rats, there was either no sex difference in latencies (to akinetic and focal seizures) or females had significantly shorter latencies than males (to status epilepticus, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and myoclonic seizures). Testosterone-treated male rats had a significantly longer mean latency than controls for status epilepticus only; otherwise, these males showed no significant differences between mean latencies before and after testosterone (to focal, myoclonic, or generalized tonic-clonic seizures). In females, mean latencies to myoclonic seizures and status epilepticus were significantly shorter after testosterone than before. It was concluded that there is a sex difference in susceptibility to epileptic seizures in rats, provided that the estrous cycle is taken into account. Testosterone may increase and decrease seizure susceptibility in females and males, respectively. These effects may be important for understanding the mechanisms of epileptic phenomena and may provide some important clues to epilepsy treatment.
Most children with cystic fibrosis (CF) show persisting steatorrhoea even when treated with pancreatic enzyme. As a low duodenal pH could be responsible for this persisting fat loss, we evaluated the effects of a proton-pump inhibitor (lansoprazole) on both steatorrhoea and growth parameters in 15 CF patients, aged 3.1-22.6 y. Acid steatocrit, anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were used to evaluate steatorrhoea and the nutritional status before, during and 3 months after stopping lansoprazole treatment (15 mg/d for 3 months). Mean +/- SD acid steatocrit values decreased from 37.1 +/- 8.8% to 28.5 +/- 10.6% (p = 0.02). Significant mean Z-score improvements were found for weight (+0.14; p = 0.02), height (+0.15; p = 0.03), subscapular (+0.61; p = 0.003), supra-iliac (+0.8; p = 0.002) and the sum of the four measured skinfolds (+0.61; p = 0.002). Z-scores deteriorated again after stopping lansoprazole. Fat mass and bone mineral content increased significantly on lansoprazole (p = 0.008 and p = 0.005, respectively). We conclude that lansoprazole as adjuvant therapy significantly improves both steatorrhoea and the nutritional status in CF children who maintain steatorrhoea while on pancreatic enzymes.
The main objective was to evaluate the effect of five second-generation antipsychotics (amisulpride, quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and zotepine) on prolactinaemia during 6 week therapy in 433 female in-patients with mainly schizophrenic disorders. Secondary objectives included identification of dynamics of change in serum prolactin levels and correlations of changes of prolactinaemia with some demographic and clinical parameters.
The trial was a prospective, open-label, single-center one with a flexible dosing of SGAs. The therapeutic effect of SGAs was assessed by a change of scores of CGI-S and CGI-I scales from a baseline to the endpoint. Blood samples were taken in the morning under fasting condition.
Amisulpride and risperidone increased prolactinaemia significantly in 100% of patients, as early as after week 1 of the therapy. Quetiapine and zotepine relatively reduced prolactinaemia significantly, as early as from week 1 of the quetiapine treatment. Olanzapine led to a transient mild prolactin elevation. The much lower prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia over 2 000 mIU/l differentiates olanzapine from amisulpride and risperidone. Prolactin elevation did not correlate with age, menopausal condition, therapeutic efficacy, antipsychotic daily dose, serum levels of lipids and glucose. There was significant correlation with first vs. subsequent psychotic episodes, weight, EPS and serum levels of thyroid hormones.
Amisulpride and risperidone had marked and early prolactin elevating effects, requiring, therefore, more frequent monitoring of prolactinaemia and associated undesirable effects and risks than olanzapine, quetiapine and zotepine.
Cancer chemotherapy agents cause damage in the bone marrow, resulting in leukopenia during treatment and secondary cancers after recovery from the original disease. We created an experimental model of alkylation-based chemotherapy using ethylnitrosourea (ENU) to investigate the effect of niacin status on cancer induction. For 4 wk, nontumor-bearing weanling Long-Evans rats were fed niacin-deficient (ND) diets or were pair-fed (PF) identical quantities of a niacin-adequate diet. One week after the initiation of niacin feeding protocols, ENU treatment began (12 doses, 30 mg/kg by gavage, every other day). At the end of dietary modulation and ENU treatment, all rats were fed a high quality control diet and monitored for weight loss (>5%) and palpable tumors (>1cm), at which point they were necropsied for the presence of disease. The morbidity curves were significantly different; ND rats reached 20% morbidity 10 wk earlier than PF rats. In the first 20 wk after ENU treatment, ND rats developed 17 malignancies, including 11 leukemias, whereas PF rats developed 3 malignancies with 2 leukemias. In the end, there was a 47% greater average number of malignancies in ND vs. PF rats, despite a more rapid onset of morbidity. In short-term studies, niacin deficiency caused an 80% decrease in bone marrow NAD(+). Basal poly(ADP-ribose) levels were dramatically reduced by niacin deficiency. A single dose of ENU increased poly(ADP-ribose) levels fivefold in PF rats, whereas levels in ND rats remained 90% lower. Niacin deficiency did not alter the initial accumulation of DNA damage, indicating that drug metabolism is not an underlying factor in the diet-induced changes. These data show that niacin deficiency alters poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism in the bone marrow and increases the risk of nitrosourea-induced leukemias.
The conditioned suppression technique was employed to examine the acute effects of aspirin on auditory function in rats. Lever pressing behavior for water reinforcement was suppressed in the presence of an auditory stimulus that had been previously paired with electric shocks. A single intravenous injection of aspirin at a dose of 225 mg/kg caused an erroneous lever pressing response in the broad sound intensities of 2 kHz tone stimulus during the conditioned stimulus period. A statistically significant increase in the threshold for 2 kHz was found 1 to 72 hr after dosing but not for 4, 8 and 10 kHz. These results suggest that the hearing for low sound frequency in rats is vulnerable to the effects of aspirin. This paradigm in rats may be useful to further assess the different outer hair cells along the cochlear duct and provide an additional evidence for the aspirin ototoxicity research.
In 50 infants born to women who continued to take heroin during all or part of their pregnancy the drug withdrawal symptoms were mild and were noted in 21 infants (42%). Only nine infants required treatment. Sudden infant death syndrome occurred in two infants at 4 and 6 months.
In the chick embryo, administration of the heavy metal Cadmium (Cd) induces omphalocele phenotype. Cd is a potent inhibitor of antioxidant enzymes and causes accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) such as hydrogen peroxide. Previous work with the Cd chick model has demonstrated that increased levels of MDA, as a marker for oxidative stress, 24 h post Cd treatment (24H) are identical in chick embryos exposed to Cd. Furthermore, of the several antioxidants assessed, only N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to reduce MDA levels to control values in the Cd-treated chick embryo. However, the molecular mechanisms by which NAC acts to maintain oxidative stress in the Cd-induced ventral body wall defect chick model remains to be unclear. We designed this study to investigate the hypothesis that gene expression levels of antioxidant enzymes are downregulated in malformed embryos exposed to Cd compared to controls and to determine the effect of pre-treatment with NAC on the expression levels of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes.
After 60 h incubation, chick embryos were pre-treated with NAC and exposed to either chick saline or Cd. Chicks were then harvested at 24H and divided into five groups: control, Cd group without malformation [Cd(-)], Cd group with malformation [Cd(+)], NAC + Cd(-) and NAC + Cd(+). Real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the relative mRNA expression levels of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1, SOD2, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX)-4. Differences between five groups were tested by Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test following one-way ANOVA. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Immunohistochemistry was also performed to evaluate protein expression.
The mRNA expression levels of SOD2 and CAT were significantly decreased in Cd(+) as compared to controls, whereas there was no significant difference between controls and Cd(-) (p < 0.05 vs. controls). In addition, gene expression levels of SOD2 and CAT were significantly increased in NAC + Cd(-) as compared to Cd(+) and NAC + Cd(+) (p < 0.05 vs. controls). However, there were no significant differences in the expression levels of SOD1 and GPX4 among any groups. Increased immunoreactivity of SOD2 and CAT was also observed in NAC + Cd(-) as compared to Cd(+) and NAC + Cd(+).
Our results suggest that SOD2 and CAT may play an important role in preventing Cd-induced teratogenesis. Prenatal treatment with drugs which can upregulate SOD2 and CAT transcripts may have a therapeutic potential in preventing omphalocele phenotype.
To evaluate the direct effects of Cyperi Rhizoma (CR), a plant water extract, on Th1/Th2 lineage development in vitro, this study was conducted. Sorted CD4(+) T cells obtained from the splenocytes of BALB/c mice were activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and then cultured in medium that contained CR medium under Th1 inducing or Th2 inducing conditions. Subsequently, IFN-gamma or IL-4 secreting cells were quantitated using flow cytometry analysis. In addition, IFN-gamma and IL-4 protein secretions were detected by ELISA analysis, after which, IFN-gamma and T-bet transcripts, key players in the Th1 immune function, and also, IL-4 and GATA-3, which are primary components in the Th2 immune mechanism, were quantitated by real-time RT-PCR. CR had no mitogenic effects on un-stimulated CD4(+) T cells, however, it increased the CD4(+) T cell population. Th1/Th2 polarization experiments revealed that CR enhanced IFN-gamma secretion in Th1 cells, but reduced the IL-4 in Th2 cells, and this occurred in a dose-dependent manner and showed significances. In addition, under Th1/Th2 skewed conditions, the transcription levels of IFN-gamma and T-bet were considerably increased, while the expressions of IL-4 and GATA-3 were relatively decreased with CR treatment. These findings suggest that CR enhances Th1 lineage development by increasing Th1 specific cytokine expression and secretion and reduces Th2 lineage development by repressing Th2 specific cytokine productions. Therefore, CR extract may be useful for preventing the onset of allergies or improving allergic symptoms.
The acute toxicity and pharmacological effects of d-nicotine were examined in several species of animals and compared with those of l-nicotine. The LD50s for intravenous administration of d- and l-nicotine were 6.15 and 0.33 mg/kg, respectively. In unanesthetized rhesus monkeys, EEG activity was not influenced by d-nicotine, 64 micrograms/kg, i.v., while the same dose of l-nicotine produced seizure-like waves with some spindles. In rats, d-nicotine increased spontaneous motor activity, and in the experiment under a DRL 20-sec schedule, it increased lever press responding, decreased the number of reinforcements and shortened interresponse time. Similar effects were also observed by administration of l-nicotine at lower doses than for the d-isomer. In anesthetized rats, d-nicotine elevated the blood pressure and increased the heart rate with a potency of about one-eighth that of the l-isomer. Further, tachyphylaxis and cross tachyphylaxis were developed to the blood pressure-raising effect in rats after repeated administration of both isomers. d-Nicotine elicited contraction of isolated rat ileum preparations, but with a potency of about one-tenth that of the l-isomer. Both isomers at the same concentration blocked transmission at the neuromuscular junction in isolated rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm muscle preparations. These results indicate that the pharmacological effects of d-nicotine are qualitatively similar to but quantitatively less potent than those of l-nicotine.
Cancer chemotherapy agents cause short-term leukopenia during treatment and the development of secondary leukemias after recovery from the original disease. We reported that niacin deficiency in rats increases the severity of nitrosourea-induced leukopenia and the subsequent development of cancers. This study was designed to test the effects of supplementing an already high quality diet with pharmacologic levels of niacin. For a period of 4 wk, nontumor-bearing weanling Long-Evans rats were pair-fed AIN-93M diets that were niacin adequate (30 mg/kg diet) or pharmacologically supplemented (4 g/kg diet) with nicotinic acid (NA) or nicotinamide (Nam). One week after the initiation of niacin feeding protocols, ethylnitrosourea (ENU) treatment began (12 doses, 30 mg/kg by gavage, every other day). ENU treatment caused leukopenia, which was not prevented by niacin supplementation. At the end of ENU treatment, all rats were switched to a niacin-adequate diet and monitored. Within 36 wk after the start of treatment, all of the ENU-treated rats either lost 5% of peak body weight or had palpable tumors > 1 cm in diameter, and were necropsied. Supplementation with NA or Nam at 4.0 g/kg diet (combined analysis) increased the latency of the ENU-induced morbidity curve, relative to niacin-adequate controls. Morbidity could be attributed in almost all cases to some form of neoplasm, with leukemias the predominant form. In short-term studies, supplementation with either NA or Nam caused dramatic increases in bone marrow NAD(+) (1- to 1.5-fold), basal poly(ADP-ribose) (3- to 5-fold) and ENU-induced poly(ADP-ribose) levels (1.5-fold). These data show that supplementation of a niacin-adequate, high quality diet with pharmacologic levels of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide increases NAD(+) and poly(ADP-ribose) levels in bone marrow and may be protective against DNA damage.
Rociverine citrate was evaluated for its ability to affect the motility of rat urinary bladder, in vitro and in vivo, in comparison with flavoxate hydrochloride. Rociverine counteracted both methacholine- and high K+-induced tonic contractions of bladder strips. In anaesthetized rats, intravenous rociverine inhibited dose-dependently frequency and amplitude of the distension-induced rhythmic contractions (DIRCs) of urinary bladder and counteracted the topical high K+-induced pressure increase in the same organ. Orally administered rociverine produced a dose-related reversal of the reserpine-induced detrusor hyperreflexia in anaesthetized rats. In each of these experimental models rociverine was more effective than flavoxate. These results point to the usefulness of rociverine in the treatment of urinary bladder motility disorders.
The primary role of cigarette smoking in the development of coronary heart disease is to cause damage to the vascular endothelium, leading to endothelial cell dysfunction and initiating the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis. We studied the response of human coronary artery endothelial cells to nicotine exposure by examining the expression of a panel of genes encoding molecules that have been shown to be involved in atherogenesis. Treatment of primary human coronary artery endothelial cells with nicotine for 24 h at concentrations (10(-5) and 10(-7) M) similar to those in the blood of smokers resulted in increased mRNA levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, angiotensin-I converting enzyme, tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, von Willebrand factor, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. No change was detected in the expression levels of the genes encoding basic fibroblast growth factor, endothelin-1, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 under these conditions. These data indicate that nicotine alters the expression of a number of endothelial genes whose products play major roles in regulating the vascular tone and thrombogenicity, making a contribution to the understanding of the effects of cigarette smoking on the development of coronary atherosclerosis.
27-hydroxycholesterol is the product of the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 sterol 27-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in cholesterol metabolism present in most tissues of the body. 27-hydroxycholesterol increases in abundance with progression of human atherosclerotic lesions, therefore the aim of this study was to determine the pattern of sterol 27-hydroxylase gene expression in normal and diseased arteries and to identify the cell types responsible for its expression.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and in situ hybridisation, utilising a sterol 27-hydroxylase cDNA probe, and immunohistochemistry, utilising an antibody to sterol 27-hydroxylase, together with an antibody to smooth muscle cell alpha-actin and an antibody to CD68, a marker for macrophages, were used to study expression of 27-hydroxylase in arterial specimens. In addition, RT-PCR was used to study expression of 27-hydroxylase in cultured macrophages and smooth muscle cells.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of normal and atherosclerotic human aortas showed that 27-hydroxylase is constitutively expressed in the normal artery wall, and is substantially up-regulated in atherosclerosis. RT-PCR analysis of 27-hydroxylase expression in vitro demonstrated that macrophages constitutively express high levels throughout their differentiation in culture whilst de-differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells express very low levels. In situ hybridisation revealed that in normal artery and fatty streaks, expression of mRNA for 27-hydroxylase was low in the media, but higher in intimal smooth muscle cells. The macrophages of fatty streaks expressed low or undetectable levels of 27-hydroxylase. However in advanced lesions the highest expression of 27-hydroxylase was detectable in macrophages. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that high levels of 27-hydroxylase protein occurred in macrophages near the shoulder region of plaques, at the edge of the lipid core.
27-hydroxylase may constitute a protective mechanism for removing cholesterol from macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Genetic heterogeneity resulting in differences in sterol 27-hydroxylase activity between individuals may affect their ability to deal with accumulated cholesterol in the arterial intima, and hence their relative degree of predisposition to atherosclerosis.
Pulmonary hypoplasia (PH), the leading cause of mortality in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), is associated with arrested alveolarization. Late gestation lung protein 1 (LGL1) plays a crucial role in the regulation of alveolarization. Inhibition of LGL1 impairs alveolar maturation in fetal rat lungs. LGL1 heterozygotus knockout mice display delayed lung maturation. It is well known that prenatal administration of retinoic acid (RA) stimulates alveologenesis in nitrofen-induced PH. In vitro studies have reported that RA is a key modulator of LGL1 during alveologenesis. We hypothesized, that pulmonary gene expression of LGL1 is downregulated in the late stage of lung development, and that prenatal administration of RA upregulates pulmonary LGL1 expression in the nitrofen CDH model.
Pregnant rats were exposed to nitrofen on day 9 (D9) of gestation. RA was given intraperitoneally on D18, D19 and D20. Fetal lungs were dissected on D21 and divided into control, control + RA, CDH and CDH + RA group. Expression levels of LGL1 were determined using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
On D21, LGL1 relative mRNA expression levels were significantly downregulated in CDH group compared to controls. After RA treatment, gene expression levels of LGL1 were significantly upregulated in CDH + RA and control + RA compared to CDH group. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed these results.
Downregulation of pulmonary LGL1 gene expression in the late stage of lung development may interfere with normal alveologenesis. Upregulation of LGL1 pulmonary gene expression after RA treatment may promote lung growth by stimulating alveologenesis in the nitrofen CDH model.
The definition of the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after resection represents a central issue to improve the clinical management of patients. In this study we examined the prognostic relevance of infiltrating immune cell subsets in the tumor (TIL) and in nontumorous (NT) liver (LIL), and the expression of immune-related and lineage-specific mRNAs in HCC and NT liver derived from 42 patients. The phenotype of infiltrating cells was analyzed by flow cytometry, and mRNA expression in liver tissue was examined by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The tumor immune microenvironment was enriched in inhibitory and dysfunctional cell subsets. Enrichment in CD4+ T-cells and in particular CD4 and CD8+ memory subsets within TIL was predictive of better overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR). Increased programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) mRNA content and higher prevalence of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells were associated with shorter OS and TTR, respectively. By combined evaluation of infiltrating cell subsets along with mRNA profiling of immune and tumor related genes, we identified the intratumoral frequency of memory T-cells and iNKT-cells as well as PDL1 expression as the best predictors of clinical outcome. HCC infiltrate is characterized by the expression of molecules with negative regulatory function that may favor tumor recurrence and poor survival.
