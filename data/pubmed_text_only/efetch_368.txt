The efficacy of lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, has been established by numerous studies. At doses of 40 mg administered twice daily, lovastatin produces a mean reduction in total plasma cholesterol of 33%, attributable to a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 41%. The drug also produces a mean increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 9%, and a reduction in the high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio of 44%. The serious reported adverse effects of lovastatin are myopathy (0.5%) and asymptomatic but marked and persistent increases in transaminases (1.9%). Both are reversible when therapy is discontinued. Myopathy has occurred mainly in patients with complicated histories who were receiving concomitant therapy with immunosuppressive drugs, gemfibrozil or niacin. In an ongoing long-term safety study, 744 patients have received lovastatin for an average duration of 2.5 years up to March 1988. Fifteen patients (2.0%) have been withdrawn because of drug-attributable adverse events: raised transaminases (9), skin rash (2), gastrointestinal symptoms (2), myopathy (1) and insomnia (1). No effect of the drug on the human lens has been observed up to the date mentioned above. Lovastatin has been available in the United States since September 1987. By March 1988, the drug had been prescribed for approximately 250,000 patients. This clinical experience has confirmed the tolerability observed in clinical trials. The good adverse-effect profile of lovastatin is thus now supported both by a substantial body of data in patients treated for over 2 years in clinical trials, and by experience in clinical use with a large number of patients since the drug has been available for prescription.
By 2003, an estimated 34 million Americans had used cocaine according to the National Survey on Drug Use & Health. About 5.9 million of those had used in the past 12 months. Chronic cocaine users often develop addiction, dependency and tolerance to the drug. The psychological and physical effects of cocaine are due to the disruption of the limbic system in the central nervous system (CNS). Increased oxidative stress reported in the frontal cortex and the striatum of rats exposed to cocaine suggests that oxidative damage plays a significant role in cocaine-induced disruption of the CNS. Although it is evident that cocaine induces oxidative stress in the CNS, little has been learned about whether such increased oxidative stress is also relevant to apoptosis in cocaine-exposed models. To gain insight into the role of cocaine-induced oxidative stress in apoptosis, we hypothesized that oxidative stress precedes cell death when cocaine is administrated. To test this hypothesis, we have monitored the oxidative stress and apoptotic effects of acute cocaine exposure in human neuronal progenitor cells (HNPC). We found that oxidative stress was significantly increased at 48h after a 30min cocaine exposure compared to control cells, and that this was followed by cell death at 72h. Using the same experimental paradigm we have previously shown that pro-inflammatory genes are up-regulated in cocaine-exposed HNPC at 24h. Therefore, we suggest that the increased oxidative stress (possibly mediated by inflammatory responses) precedes cell death in cocaine-exposed HNPC. This may have implications for the consequences of cocaine abuse in situations where antioxidant capacity is compromised, as in the aging brain.
Repeated dose (14 days), subchronic (13 wk) and chronic (2 yr) studies were carried out in succession to evaluate the toxic and carcinogenic effects of diglycidyl resorcinol ether (DGRE), a liquid spray epoxy resin, in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. DGRE in corn oil was administered by gavage for 14 consecutive days in the repeated dose study and 5 days/wk in the subchronic and chronic studies. The mortality rate was increased in rats and mice in the repeated dose and subchronic studies. Hyperkeratosis, basal cell hyperplasia and squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach were observed in a few treated rats and mice in the subchronic study. Based on the results of the subchronic study, F344/N rats and B6CF1 mice (50 males and 50 females/species/dose) were administered DGRE (rats--0, 12, 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight, mice--0, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight) in corn oil by gavage 5 days/wk for 103 wk. The incidence of neoplastic and non-neoplastic changes of the forestomach was increased in rats and mice in the chronic study. Under the conditions of the study, DGRE is considered to be carcinogenic to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice.
Resveratrol is a polyphenolic phytoalexin produced in appreciable amounts as a secondary metabolite in grapevines in response to fungal infections. Based on the present knowledge, it appears to be a promising bioactive natural molecule with potential applications in phytotherapy or pharmacology. The present study was aimed to evaluate the antidiabetic properties of resveratrol in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced experimental diabetes in rats. The diabetic rats orally treated with resveratrol (5 mg kg(-)(1)b.w d(-)(1)) for 30 days resulted in significant (p<0.05) decrease in the levels of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood urea, serum uric acid, serum creatinine and diminished activities of pathophysiological enzymes such as aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The antihyperglycemic nature of resveratrol is also evidenced from the improvement in the levels of plasma insulin and hemoglobin. Further, the results are comparable with glyclazide, an oral standard drug. Thus, the present findings suggest that resveratrol may be considered as an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
Lamivudine resistance occurs in patients with chronic hepatitis B at rates of 16%-32% after 1 year and 49% after 3 years. Adefovir dipivoxil, a nucleotide analogue recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, is effective against hepatitis B virus (HBV) but has been associated with renal toxicity at high doses. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is another nucleotide analogue with demonstrated antiviral activity against both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV. Tenofovir, at its licensed dose, has not been associated with renal dysfunction.
We describe a series of 9 patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B treated with tenofovir, 300 mg, once daily before the availability of adefovir. Levels of HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) were monitored.
The addition of tenofovir to the existing regimen of lamivudine resulted in a median decline of 4.5 log(10) copies/mL in HBV DNA levels (range, 3.2-6.3 log(10) copies/mL) after a median treatment duration of 12 months (range, 6-16 mo). HBeAg seroconversion was observed in 2 patients, with a third patient undergoing HBeAg loss while remaining anti-HBe negative. In 4 of 7 patients with elevated ALT levels at baseline, ALT levels normalized. No significant adverse events were encountered during treatment.
In patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B, treatment with tenofovir is well tolerated and results in significant virological, serological, and biochemical improvements on par with those seen with high-dose adefovir (30 mg/day) therapy, without the complication of renal toxicity.
BMS-645737, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor-1, has anti-angiogenic activity and was evaluated in nonclinical studies as a treatment for cancer. This article characterizes the BMS-645737-induced clinical, gross, and histologic lesions of incisor teeth in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Rats received 0 800 mg/kg BMS-645737 in a single-dose study or consecutive daily doses of 0 20 mg/kg/day in a 1-month study. The reversibility of these effects was assessed in the 1-month study. White discoloration and fracture of incisors were observed clinically and grossly in the 1-month study. In both studies, dose-dependent histopathologic lesions of incisors were degeneration and/or necrosis of odontoblasts and ameloblasts; decreased mineralization of dentin; inflammation and necrosis of the dental pulp; and edema, congestion, and hemorrhage in the pulp and periodontal tissue adjacent to the enamel organ. Partial recovery was observed at lower doses after a two-week dose-free period in the one-month study. Drug-induced incisor lesions were considered to be related to the pharmacologic inhibitory effects on VEGF and FGF signaling, that is, inhibition of growth and maintenance of small-diameter vessels that support the formation of dentin and enamel in growing teeth and/or to perturbances of function of odontoblasts and ameloblasts or their precursors.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) was initially identified as a receptor that bound 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related environmental toxicants; however, there is increasing evidence that the AHR is an important new drug target for treating multiple diseases including breast cancer. Treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative MDA-MB-231 and BT474 breast cancer cells with TCDD or the selective AHR modulator 6-methyl-1,3,-trichlorodibenzofuran (MCDF) inhibited breast cancer cell invasion in a Boyden chamber assay. These results were similar to those previously reported for the antimetastic microRNA-335 (miR-335). Both TCDD and MCDF induced miR-335 in MDA-MB-231 and BT474 cells and this was accompanied by downregulation of SOX4, a miR-335-regulated (inhibited) gene. The effects of TCDD and MCDF on miR-335 and SOX4 expression and interactions of miR-335 with the 3'-UTR target sequence in the SOX4 gene were all inhibited in cells transfected with an oligonucleotide (iAHR) that knocks down the AHR, thus confirming AHR-miR-335 interactions. MCDF (40 mg/kg/d) also inhibited lung metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells in a tail vein injection model, showing that the AHR is a potential new target for treating patients with ER-negative breast cancer, a disease where treatment options and their effectiveness are limited.
Fhit expression is reduced in most cancers, and Fhit replacement by FHIT expression viruses in lung, esophageal, pancreatic, and cervical cancers induces apoptosis in the cancer cells. Mice carrying one or two inactivated Fhit alleles are hypersensitive to development of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced forestomach tumors. In the present study, we investigated the kinetics and mechanism of tumor reversal and intervention by oral delivery of FHIT expression viruses. Tumor analysis showed that: a) by 37 days post-NMBA, control mice showed approximately 7 tumors and by 84 days approximately 10 tumors/forestomach; b) mice receiving FHIT virus at 2 or 42 days post-NMBA showed significantly reduced tumor burdens; c) Fhit was still expressed at 82 days postinfection; d) control viral infection had no effect on tumor development; and e) reduced Bcl2, increased Bax expression, and increased TUNEL-positive apoptotic nuclei characterized the restored epithelia of FHIT transduced forestomachs. Thus, FHIT viral gene delivery prevents or retards development of carcinogen-induced forestomach tumors and reverses development of established tumors by 60-70% through an apoptotic pathway. This dramatic reduction in tumor burden emphasizes the efficacy of targeting the FHIT apoptotic pathway for tumor eradication.
The zinc ion (Zn2+) is abundant in neurons. However, excessive Zn2+ can induce neuronal cell death. This study examined the role of Zn2+ in transient retinal ischemia in adult male rats. The rats were sacrificed 4-24 h after retinal ischemia by high intra-ocular pressure, and the retinas were prepared for microscopic examination of retinal cell degeneration, and fluorescence microscopy using zinquin ethyl ester as the zinc ion-specific probe. Moreover, COX-2 expression was observed by Western blotting. In control retinas, there was a low Zn2+ concentration in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), a high Zn2+ concentration in the outer plexiform layer (OPL), and no detectable Zn2+ in either the ganglion cell layer (GCL) or the inner nuclear layer (INL). In contrast, in the retinas exposed to ischemia without the administration of the zinc ion chelators (Ca2+-EDTA and TPEN), Zn2+ deposits were found in the IPL and INL beginning 4 h after ischemia and degeneration of neurons was found in the GCL and INL. Less Zn2+ accumulation in the IPL and INL and less neuronal degeneration in the GCL and INL were found in the retinas treated with Ca2+-EDTA or TPEN before ischemia. Furthermore, the COX-2 protein levels increased 4-8 h after retinal ischemia, and chelation of zinc ion inhibited this effect. These results suggest that the accumulation of Zn2+ following an ischemic insult can cause retinal degeneration and induce abnormal COX-2 expression.
Exposures to high levels of environmental selenium have been associated with motor neuron disease in both animals and humans and high levels of selenite have been identified in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have shown previously that exposures to high levels of sodium selenite in the environment of Caenorhabditis elegans adult animals can induce neurodegeneration and cell loss resulting in motor deficits and death and that this is at least partially caused by a reduction in cholinergic signaling across the neuromuscular junction. Here we provide evidence that reduction in insulin/insulin-like (IIS) signaling alters response to high dose levels of environmental selenium which in turn can regulate the IIS pathway. Most specifically we show that nuclear localization and thus activation of the DAF-16/forkhead box transcription factor occurs in response to selenium exposure although this was not observed in motor neurons of the ventral cord. Yet, tissue specific expression and generalized overexpression of DAF-16 can partially rescue the neurodegenerative and behavioral deficits observed with high dose selenium exposures in not only the cholinergic, but also the GABAergic motor neurons. In addition, two modifiers of IIS signaling, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog, deleted on chromosome 10) and PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) are required for the cellular antioxidant reduced glutathione to mitigate the selenium-induced movement deficits. Studies have suggested that environmental exposures can lead to ALS or other neurological diseases and this model of selenium-induced neurodegeneration developed in a genetically tractable organism provides a tool for examining the combined roles of genetics and environment in the neuro-pathologic disease process.
An elderly patient, receiving long-term oral diltiazem at the usual dosage, presented a sudden attack of junctional bradycardia at 35 b X min-1; this was badly tolerated by the patient. The diltiazem blood level was normal. After recovery, nodal investigations were also normal. The treatment of this accident due to a calcium-blocker is stressed: the intravenous injection of a calcium salt only was sufficient, with a return to near-normal sinus function, so avoiding the necessity of pacing.
Haemorragic cystitis is a well known complication of cyclophosphamide therapy. In the reported case, a 7 years old boy treated for lymphosarcoma, as an excretory urogram demonstrated important focal irregularity of the bladder wall. Cystoscopy revealed areas of important bullous oedema with generalized hyperemia. A biopsy disclosed normal urothelium raised by oedematous and congestive chorion and excluded a malignant tumor. Various kinds of endoscopic and surgical procedures are reported to control persisting hematuria after withdrawal of the cyclophosphamide treatment.
Establishment of Entamoeba histolytica infection is facilitated through macrophage effector disruption by a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-mediated mechanism. Infection severity may be measured by weight of abscess formed. Indomethacin (Indo) treatment of infected hamsters reduced abscess weight by 30% at 7 days post-infection presumably by inhibition of PGE2. To explain reductions in abscess development by Indo treatment, we determined liver functionality in Indo-treated or untreated animals, either healthy or infected. Determinations of serum glutamic oxaloacetic (SGOT) and glutamic pyruvic (SGPT) transaminases, serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), total serum protein (TSP), and bilirubinemia were done. SGOT, SGPT, and SAP activities showed a significant increase in their values by 600% at seven days post-infection in infected animals in both conditions; nonstatistical differences were found between animals treated or not. This increase did not correlate with the percentage of damage. Infected nontreated hamsters showed TSP levels 30% below normal group (P < 0.05). Infected Indo-treated hamsters had no significant differences compared to normal values. Infected nontreated animals showed an increase in bilirubin, particularly in indirect bilirubin, whereas infected Indo-treated hamsters showed total bilirubin values lower than normals (P < 0.05), with a decrease in direct bilirubin levels. Our results demonstrated that E. histolytica infection in hamsters produces similar abnormalities in liver function as it does in humans, and that the beneficial effect of Indo treatment on amoebic abscess development is not related with an improvement of liver functionality.
Exposure to the plant nephrotoxin and carcinogen aristolochic acid (AA) leads to the development of AA nephropathy, Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and upper urothelial carcinoma (UUC) in humans. Beside AA, exposure to ochratoxin A (OTA) was linked to BEN. Although OTA was rejected as a factor for BEN/UUC, there is still no information whether the development of AA-induced BEN/UUC is influenced by OTA exposure. Therefore, we studied the influence of OTA on the genotoxicity of AA (AA-DNA adduct formation) in vivo. AA-DNA adducts were formed in liver and kidney of rats treated with AA or AA combined with OTA, but no OTA-related DNA adducts were detectable in rats treated with OTA alone or OTA combined with AA. Compared to rats treated with AA alone, AA-DNA adduct levels were 5.4- and 1.6-fold higher in liver and kidney, respectively, of rats treated with AA combined with OTA. Although AA and OTA induced NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) activating AA to DNA adducts, their combined treatment did not lead to either higher NQO1 enzyme activity or higher AA-DNA adduct levels in ex vivo incubations. Oxidation of AA I (8-methoxy-6-nitrophenanthro[3,4-d]-1,3-dioxole-5-carboxylic acid) to its detoxification metabolite, 8-hydroxyaristolochic acid, was lower in microsomes from rats treated with AA and OTA, and this was paralleled by lower activities of cytochromes P450 1A1/2 and/or 2C11 in these microsomes. Our results indicate that a decrease in AA detoxification after combined exposure to AA and OTA leads to an increase in AA-DNA adduct formation in liver and kidney of rats.
We designed this study to investigate the modulating effects of duloxetine on symptoms and grey matter of patients with major depressive disorder combined with panic disorder. We also aimed to discover if there was any persistence of grey-matter deficits after remission and to find 'trait markers' for this comorbidity. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometric measurements were performed on 15 patients at baseline and remitted status (week 6) compared to 15 healthy control subjects who were scanned twice within 6 wk. The rating scales of depressive and panic symptoms improved with statistical significance (corrected p<0.001). A widespread pattern of grey-matter deficits in infero-frontal, limbic, occipital, temporo-parietal, cerebellar areas (trait marker regions) in drug-naive patients were observed compared to controls at baseline (family-wise error corrected p<0.0002). There were no significant changes of grey matter in healthy controls over the 6-wk period. Duloxetine-induced increases of grey matter were very subtle in left infero-frontal cortex, right fusiform gyrus, and right cerebellum VIIIa areas (state marker regions) after 6-wk therapy (uncorrected p<0.0005). Duloxetine did not increase grey matter to the level of control subjects and grey-matter deficits in patients appear largely unaffected by duloxetine. We suggest that short-term duloxetine therapy improved the clinical symptoms of patients with major depressive disorder combined with panic disorder. These improvements might be related to a modest increase of grey matter in state marker regions of the brain. The deficits of trait marker regions were more evident and are likely to be important for pathogenesis.
Five patients developed cerebellar degeneration while being treated with phenytoin. All had high plasma levels of the drug, and none was having seizures of a type that could have caused systemic hypoxia at the time the cerebellar syndrome appeared. Cerebellar degeneration was confirmed by the finding of atrophy on CT scan and by persistence of cerebellar signs when plasma phenytoin levels were decreased. We suggest that chronic phenytoin therapy can cause cerebellar degeneration. The question of whether phenytoin or the cumulative effect of hypoxia from repeated convulsions causes cerebellar degeneration should not be posed as one of exclusive alternatives, since hypoxia is a well-known cause of cerebellar atrophy. Instead, the question should be whether or not phenytoin can also be responsible. The cases reported here suggest that it can.
We have previously shown that depletion of vitamin D3 in rats results in a large increase in the contractile function of isolated hearts (R. E. Weishaar, J. Clin. Invest. 79: 1706-1712, 1987). To characterize the mechanism responsible for this increase, the effect of vitamin D3 depletion on key physical and morphological properties of cardiac muscle was examined. Depletion of vitamin D3 increased the heart weight/body weight ratio. This increase could neither be blocked by limiting hypocalcemia nor reversed by restoring increasing serum calcium levels. The cardiomegaly observed 9 wk after vitamin D3 depletion was not accompanied by an increase in myocardial water content or leakage of myocardial creatine phosphokinase and was not caused by myocardial cell hypertrophy. Histological examination of ventricular muscle from vitamin D3-deficient rats revealed a significant decrease in myofibrillar area and a significant increase in extracellular space. The increase in extracellular space was accompanied by a significant increase in myocardial collagen. Prevention of hypocalcemia in the vitamin D3-deficient rats did not prevent the increase in myocardial collagen. Such alterations in the physical and morphological properties of myocardial tissue might represent the basis for the change in myocardial contractile function that accompanies lengthy periods of vitamin D3 deficiency.
Distal colonic adenomas found on flexible sigmoidoscopy are associated with proximal neoplasias, thus requiring a complete colonoscopic examination, but data regarding the association of distal mixed polyps with proximal neoplasia are lacking. We conducted this study to elucidate the significance of distal mixed colonic polyps in predicting proximal neoplasia.
We retrospectively analyzed data from patients who underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopic examination for colorectal cancer screening and a follow-up colonoscopic examination because of distal colonic polyps. Distal index polyps were classified by a pathologist as early tubular adenoma (ETA), serrated, or true mixed categories. Index polyps also were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody, Adnab-9, a marker for the colorectal adenoma carcinoma sequence.
In 636 patients with distal index polyps, 6% were malignant, 55% were adenomas, 13% were ETAs, 6% were serrated, 4% were true mixed, and 17% were hyperplastic. Compared with distal hyperplastic index polyps, distal malignant polyps (P = 0.0006) and adenomas (P = 0.001) were associated with a significantly increased number of synchronous proximal neoplasia, but the small distal mixed, serrated, or ETA did not predict the increased incidence of proximal neoplasia. Large distal polyps of each category were significantly associated with an increased number of synchronous proximal neoplasias. In support of these findings, immunostaining of distal polyps with Adnab-9 showed predictability for proximal neoplasia only in the adenoma category (P < 0.05).
Small ETAs, serrated, or mixed polyps found on flexible sigmoidoscopic examination do not increase the probability of synchronous proximal neoplasia.
A male neonate with a Chiari malformation and a leaking myelomeningocoele underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion followed by repair of myelomeningocoele. During anaesthesia and surgery, he inadvertently became moderately hypothermic. Intravenous phenytoin was administered during the later part of the surgery for seizure prophylaxis. Following phenytoin administration, the patient developed acute severe bradycardia, refractory to atropine and adrenaline. The cardiac depressant actions of phenytoin and hypothermia can be additive. Administration of phenytoin in the presence of hypothermia may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children. As phenytoin is a commonly used drug, clinicians need to be aware of this interaction.
We report that, in the rat, administering insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II, also known as IGF2) significantly enhances memory retention and prevents forgetting. Inhibitory avoidance learning leads to an increase in hippocampal expression of IGF-II, which requires the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein β and is essential for memory consolidation. Furthermore, injections of recombinant IGF-II into the hippocampus after either training or memory retrieval significantly enhance memory retention and prevent forgetting. To be effective, IGF-II needs to be administered within a sensitive period of memory consolidation. IGF-II-dependent memory enhancement requires IGF-II receptors, new protein synthesis, the function of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein and glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Moreover, it correlates with a significant activation of synaptic GSK3β and increased expression of GluR1 (also known as GRIA1) α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasolepropionic acid receptor subunits. In hippocampal slices, IGF-II promotes IGF-II receptor-dependent, persistent long-term potentiation after weak synaptic stimulation. Thus, IGF-II may represent a novel target for cognitive enhancement therapies.
We previously reported reduced sperm concentration and motility in fertile men in a U.S. agrarian area (Columbia, MO) relative to men from U.S. urban centers (Minneapolis, MN; Los Angeles, CA; New York, NY). In the present study we address the hypothesis that pesticides currently used in agriculture in the Midwest contributed to these differences in semen quality. We selected men in whom all semen parameters (concentration, percentage sperm with normal morphology, and percentage motile sperm) were low (cases) and men in whom all semen parameters were within normal limits (controls) within Missouri and Minnesota (sample sizes of 50 and 36, respectively) and measured metabolites of eight current-use pesticides in urine samples provided at the time of semen collection. All pesticide analyses were conducted blind with respect to center and case-control status. Pesticide metabolite levels were elevated in Missouri cases, compared with controls, for the herbicides alachlor and atrazine and for the insecticide diazinon [2-isopropoxy-4-methyl-pyrimidinol (IMPY)]; for Wilcoxon rank test, p = 0.0007, 0.012, and 0.0004 for alachlor, atrazine, and IMPY, respectively. Men from Missouri with high levels of alachlor or IMPY were significantly more likely to be cases than were men with low levels [odds ratios (ORs) = 30.0 and 16.7 for alachlor and IMPY, respectively], as were men with atrazine levels higher than the limit of detection (OR = 11.3). The herbicides 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and metolachlor were also associated with poor semen quality in some analyses, whereas acetochlor levels were lower in cases than in controls (p = 0.04). No significant associations were seen for any pesticides within Minnesota, where levels of agricultural pesticides were low, or for the insect repellent DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) or the malathion metabolite malathion dicarboxylic acid. These associations between current-use pesticides and reduced semen quality suggest that agricultural chemicals may have contributed to the reduction in semen quality in fertile men from mid-Missouri we reported previously.
Link protein (LP), an extracellular matrix protein in cartilage, stabilizes aggregates of aggrecan and hyaluronan, giving cartilage its tensile strength and elasticity. Cartilage provides the template for endochondral ossification and is crucial for determining the length and width of the skeleton. During endochondral bone formation, hypertrophic chondrocytes die and the cartilage is replaced with bone matrix. Here, we have generated targeted mutations in mice in the gene encoding LP (Crtl1). Homozygotes showed defects in cartilage development and delayed bone formation with short limbs and craniofacial anomalies. Most Crtl1(tm1Nid/tm1Nid) mice died shortly after birth due to respiratory failure, but some survived and developed progressive dwarfism and lordosis of the cervical spine. They showed small epiphysis, slightly flared metaphysis of long bones and flattened vertebrae, characteristic of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias. The cartilage contained significantly reduced aggrecan depositions in the hypertrophic zone, and decreased numbers of prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes. Reduced Indian hedgehog (Ihh) expression was observed in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, and apoptosis was inhibited in hypertrophic chondrocytes. These results indicate that LP is important for the formation of proteoglycan aggregates and normal organization of hypertrophic chondrocytes, and suggest that cartilage matrix has a role in chondrocyte differentiation and maturation.
Groups of 10 male Hartley guinea pigs were exposed to 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, or 0.1% (v/v) 1,1-Dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (HCFC-123) or 1.0% (v/v) halothane by inhalation for 4 hr. A sixth group of 10 guinea pigs received only air. All animals were sacrificed 48 hr postexposure. Gross and histopathologic examination of the liver, heart, and kidney and routine hematology and clinical chemistry analyses [including isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH)] were done on all guinea pigs. Lesions related to HCFC-123 and halothane exposure were limited to the liver and included centrolobular vacuolar (fatty) change, multifocal random degeneration and necrosis, and centrolobular degeneration and necrosis. These lesions were observed in 90-100% of the exposed animals and were absent in the air-only controls. There was significant individual animal variation in susceptibility to both HCFC-123 and halothane, resulting in a spectrum of histologic lesions and clinical chemistry values within each exposure group. Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and ICDH were the most significant predictors of hepatocellular damage. Similarities in the response between halothane and HCFC-123 in this guinea pig model suggests that humans susceptible to halothane-induced hepatitis may be susceptible to HCFC-123 by a common mechanism of toxicity.
In aortic stenosis (AS), conventional indexes of severity vary with changes in transvalvular flow. It is important to determine the true severity of obstruction because AS in the presence of low cardiac output and low gradient is associated with high mortality during aortic valve replacement. This study compares 3 indexes of stenosis severity at different transvalvular flow rates in patients with low-flow, low-gradient critical AS. Eight patients with critical AS (valve area < or = 0.7 cm2), low cardiac output (< 4.0 L/min), and low mean transvalvular gradient (< or = 40 mm Hg) underwent hemodynamic assessment at baseline, after transvalvular flow was augmented with dobutamine, and after the valve opening was increased with percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Severity of obstruction was assessed using 3 different measures: Gorlin formula calculated valve area, valvular resistance, and percentage left ventricular stroke work loss. Dobutamine infusion increased cardiac output by 35% and mean transvalvular gradient by 27%. The mean Gorlin formula calculated aortic valve area increased from 0.5 to 0.6 cm2 (p = 0.002). Percentage left ventricular stroke work loss increased from 23% to 28% (p = 0.03). Valve resistance was unchanged by dobutamine (350 to 310 dynes X sec X cm(-5); p = NS). Balloon valvuloplasty increased cardiac output 13% and decreased the gradient 31%; this resulted in an increase in the calculated valve area from 0.6 to 0.9 cm2 (p = 0.001). Percentage left ventricular stroke work loss decreased from 28% to 20% (p = 0.002), and valve resistance decreased from 310 to 181 dynes X sec X cm(-5) (p = 0.001) after valvuloplasty. We conclude that in patients with low-flow, low-gradient critical AS, valve resistance is the most flow-independent measure of severity of stenosis. All measures improve with percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
Diabetic neuropathic pain, an important microvascular complication in diabetes mellitus is recognised as one of the most difficult types of pain to treat. A lack of the understanding of its aetiology, inadequate relief, development of tolerance and potential toxicity of classical antinociceptives warrant the investigation of the newer agents to relieve this pain. The aim of the present study was to explore the antinociceptive effect of curcumin and its effect on tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) release in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice. Four weeks after a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg), mice were tested in the tail immersion and hot-plate assays. Diabetic mice exhibited significant hyperalgesia along with increased plasma glucose and decreased body weights as compared with control mice. Chronic treatment with curcumin (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg body weight; p.o.) for 4 weeks starting from the 4th week of streptozotocin injection significantly attenuated thermal hyperalgesia and the hot-plate latencies. Curcumin also inhibited the TNF-alpha and NO release in a dose dependent manner. These results indicate an antinociceptive activity of curcumin possibly through its inhibitory action on NO and TNF-alpha release and point towards its potential to attenuate diabetic neuropathic pain.
An unusual fibroblastic tumor occurred in a teenage boy following treatment with cyclophosphamide for Hodgkin's disease. To our knowledge, only one other similar case has been reported. The cellular and structural composition of the tumor resembles that of cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis and therefore suggests a relationship between the two lesions.
An 87-year-old woman presented with the nephrotic syndrome 12 months after administration of ketoprofen, 100 mg daily for osteoarthritis. Clinical course and laboratory data were consistent with drug-induced nephropathy. Kidney biopsy showed membranous glomerulonephritis. Evolution was favorable with resolution of proteinuria after drug withdrawal and steroid administration. A review of the literature on nephrotic syndrome associated with NSAID reveals membranous glomerulonephritis to be an unusual complication.
