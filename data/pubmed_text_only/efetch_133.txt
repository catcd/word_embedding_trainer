Sterile hemorrhagic cystitis induced by cyclophosphamide therapy was diagnosed in 2 dogs. Clinical signs included pollakiuria, hematuria, and stranguria. The signs were progressive and referable to long-term oral cyclophosphamide administration. Dilute (1%) formalin was used to treat the hemorrhagic cystitis. Clinical control of hemorrhage was achieved in both cases, and hemorrhage did not recur.
Ascorbic acid (AA), or Vitamin C, is most well known as a nutritional supplement with antioxidant properties. Recently, we demonstrated that high concentrations of AA act on PMP22 gene expression and partially correct the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease phenotype in a mouse model. This is due to the capacity of AA, but not other antioxidants, to down-modulate cAMP intracellular concentration by a competitive inhibition of the adenylate cyclase enzymatic activity. Because of the critical role of cAMP in intracellular signalling, we decided to explore the possibility that ascorbic acid could modulate the expression of other genes.
Using human pangenomic microarrays, we found that AA inhibited the expression of two categories of genes necessary for cell cycle progression, tRNA synthetases and translation initiation factor subunits. In in vitro assays, we demonstrated that AA induced the S-phase arrest of proliferative normal and tumor cells. Highest concentrations of AA leaded to necrotic cell death. However, quiescent cells were not susceptible to AA toxicity, suggesting the blockage of protein synthesis was mainly detrimental in metabolically-active cells. Using animal models, we found that high concentrations of AA inhibited tumor progression in nude mice grafted with HT29 cells (derived from human colon carcinoma). Consistently, expression of tRNA synthetases and ieF2 appeared to be specifically decreased in tumors upon AA treatment.
AA has an antiproliferative activity, at elevated concentration that could be obtained using IV injection. This activity has been observed in vitro as well in vivo and likely results from the inhibition of expression of genes involved in protein synthesis. Implications for a clinical use in anticancer therapies will be discussed.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) studies in 20 patients at Bhopal, 1.3 +/- 0.4 yr and 2.7 +/- 0.6 yr after toxic gas exposure had revealed that the lower respiratory tract inflammation had progressed from initial macrophage alveolitis to macrophage-neutrophilic alveolitis. The interval between the two lavages was 1.4 +/- 0.6 yr. BAL studies in a new group of 24 patients 5.1 +/- 1.0 yr after exposure had confirmed chronic inflammation of the lower respiratory tract as evidenced by macrophage-neutrophilic alveolitis in these subjects as well. Clinical, radiographic and pulmonary function abnormalities were persistent in a proportion of subjects in both groups. Fibronectin (FN) levels were estimated in BAL fluid in 41 patients. Elevated FN levels were seen in 12 (29.3%) subjects and nine of these 12 had radiographic abnormalities. Severely exposed subjects (n = 30) had significantly higher BAL fibronectin levels compared to normal subjects and mild/moderately exposed subjects. Repeat FN estimations in BAL samples from 10 patients had revealed that five had abnormally high FN including three who had high FN on both occasions. The number of patients showing abnormal decline in pulmonary function was higher in patients with elevated FN than in patients with normal FN. Thus, persisting clinical, roentgenographic and ventilatory abnormalities, as well as macrophage-neutrophilic alveolitis along with abnormally elevated FN levels in a proportion of subjects, suggest the possibility that lung fibrosis can occur in subjects exposed to toxic gas at Bhopal.
We hypothesized that in epileptic brains citric acid cycle intermediate levels may be deficient leading to hyperexcitability. Anaplerosis is the metabolic refilling of deficient metabolites. Our goal was to determine the anticonvulsant effects of feeding triheptanoin, the triglyceride of anaplerotic heptanoate. CF1 mice were fed 0-35% calories from triheptanoin. Body weights and dietary intake were similar in mice fed triheptanoin vs. standard diet. Triheptanoin feeding increased blood propionyl-carnitine levels, signifying its metabolism. 35%, but not 20%, triheptanoin delayed development of corneal kindled seizures. After pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE), triheptanoin feeding increased the pentylenetetrazole tonic seizure threshold during the chronically epileptic stage. Mice in the chronically epileptic stage showed various changes in brain metabolite levels, including a reduction in malate. Triheptanoin feeding largely restored a reduction in propionyl-CoA levels and increased methylmalonyl-CoA levels in SE mice. In summary, triheptanoin was anticonvulsant in two chronic mouse models and increased levels of anaplerotic precursor metabolites in epileptic mouse brains. The mechanisms of triheptanoin's effects and its efficacy in humans suffering from epilepsy remain to be determined.
We visualize, for the first time, the profile of structural deficits in the human brain associated with chronic methamphetamine (MA) abuse. Studies of human subjects who have used MA chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral metabolic abnormalities. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and new computational brain-mapping techniques, we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic MA abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to cognitive impairment. We used high-resolution MRI and surface-based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex, hippocampus, white matter, and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used MA and 21 age-matched, healthy controls. Cortical maps revealed severe gray-matter deficits in the cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic cortices of MA abusers (averaging 11.3% below control; p < 0.05). On average, MA abusers had 7.8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects (p < 0.01; left, p = 0.01; right, p < 0.05) and significant white-matter hypertrophy (7.0%; p < 0.01). Hippocampal deficits were mapped and correlated with memory performance on a word-recall test (p < 0.05). MRI-based maps suggest that chronic methamphetamine abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to impaired memory performance. MA may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and, consistent with metabolic studies, the cingulate-limbic cortex, inducing neuroadaptation, neuropil reduction, or cell death. Prominent white-matter hypertrophy may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes, including gliosis secondary to neuronal damage. These brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of MA abuse, providing therapeutic targets for drug-induced brain injury.
To determine whether the clinical course and the response to chemotherapy of patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung depends on the presence or absence of a ras mutation in the tumor. Mutational activation of K-ras is a strong adverse prognostic factor in stage I or II lung cancer and laboratory studies have suggested that ras mutations lead to resistance against ionizing radiation and chemotherapy.
Patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung with measurable or assessable disease received chemotherapy with mesna, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (MICE). Archival biopsies, fresh biopsies, or fine-needle aspirations were tested for the presence of ras gene mutations. Associations of ras mutations with clinical characteristics, response to chemotherapy, and survival were studied.
The presence or absence of ras gene mutations could be established in 69 of 83 patients (83%). A total of 261 courses of MICE were administered to 62 informative patients, 16 of whom were shown to have a K-ras mutation-positive tumor. The frequency of mutations (26%) and the type of mutations closely matched the pattern we have previously reported in operable disease. Patients with a ras mutation in their tumor were more likely to have a close relative with lung cancer, but other clinical characteristics, such as pattern of metastases, response, and survival, were similar between the ras mutation-positive and ras mutation-negative groups.
Patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who harbor a ras mutation may have major responses to chemotherapy and have similar progression-free and overall survival as patients with ras mutation-negative tumors. K-ras mutations may represent one of several ways in which early tumors are enabled to metastasize to distant sites.
Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) regulates human intestinal smooth muscle growth by stimulating proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. IGF-I-stimulated growth is augmented when alphaVbeta3 integrin is occupied by its ligands, fibronectin and vitronectin. Increased IGF-I expression and muscle cell hyperplasia are features of stricturing Crohn's disease (CD); however, the role of IGF-I in stricture formation is unknown. The aim was to identify the functional role of endogenous IGF-I and alphaVbeta3 integrin ligands in regulating muscle cell hyperplasia in stricturing CD.
Smooth muscle cells were isolated from muscularis propria of stricturing CD or normal margins. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to measure fibronectin, vitronectin, alphaVbeta3 integrin, and IGF-I levels. Activation of the IGF-I receptor, Erk1/2, p70S6 kinase, and GSK-3beta was measured by immunoblot. Proliferation was quantified by Ki67 immunostaining and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. Apoptosis was measured from caspase-3 cleavage and nucleosome accumulation.
IGF-I, vitronectin, and fibronectin RNA and protein levels were increased 1.8- to 3.4-fold in muscle cells from strictures over normal margins. Basal IGF-I receptor phosphorylation was increased 320% in strictured over normal muscle, and basal Erk1/2, p70S6 kinase, and GSK-3beta phosphorylation were increased 205%-292% in strictures. In muscle cells from strictures, Ki67 immunoreactivity and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation were increased and apoptosis was decreased compared with normal margins. Antagonists of the IGF-I receptor or alphaVbeta3 integrin reversed these changes.
Smooth muscle cell hyperplasia in stricturing CD is regulated by increased endogenous IGF-I and alphaVbeta3 integrin ligands that regulate augmented proliferation and diminished apoptosis.
We investigated the mechanisms by which partial hepatectomy (PH) increases the ability of chemical hepatocarcinogens to induce pre-neoplastic liver foci. Comparison of the effects of pre-treatment with PH, estradiol (E2) or tamoxifen (TAM) on the yield in glutathione-S-transferase(GST-P)-positive preneoplastic foci in rat liver induced by subsequent treatment with ethylnitrosourea (ENU) or diethylnitrosamine (DENA) showed that pre-treatment with E2 increased the yield in foci induced by subsequent treatment with ENU or DENA, as compared with that in animals not pre-treated, the increase being of similar magnitude with either carcinogen. Compared with that of PH, the effect of the hormone was much more pronounced than would be expected from the relative mitogenic effect of the hormonal and surgical pre-treatments if the mitotic rate were the cause. On the other hand, the average volume of pre-neoplastic liver lesions in rats treated with ENU or DENA was 2.5 to 5.0 times higher than in rats not pretreated whenever PH was included in the pre-treatment, whereas it was not affected by any other pre-treatment.
Tacrolimus (FK506) ointment showed remarkable efficacy against atopic dermatitis in animal models and clinical trials. The suppressive effect of tacrolimus on the production of the cytokines involved in atopic dermatitis (IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-gamma and GM-CSF) from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was investigated. We constructed a new cytokine production system in which T cells are activated by direct stimulation in vitro with anti-CD3/CD2 or anti-CD3/CD28 antibody combination. Tacrolimus inhibited the production of these cytokines by both stimulations. In a comparative study with steroids (alclometasone dipropionate and betamethason valerate) in anti-CD3/CD2 system, tacrolimus and both steroids inhibited Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma), Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5) and IL-3, GM-CSF (produced by both Th1 and Th2). The suppressive effect of tacrolimus on cytokine production was stronger than that of alclometasone dipropionate and equal to or stronger than that of betamethason valerate. The effective dose of tacrolimus (IC50, 0.02-0.11 ng/ml) is almost the same as for Th1 and Th2 cytokines, and 1 ng/ml of tacrolimus suppressed all cytokines completely. These results suggest that tacrolimus suppresses the allergic cytokines from T cells, and that tacrolimus ointment is effective against atopic dermatitis through the inhibition of cytokine production.
Cocaine causes hypertension at least in part by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system, but it is not clear if this effect is centrally or peripherally mediated. To address this issue we studied the vasoconstrictive effect of cocaine in vivo and in isolated artery segments. In vivo cocaine increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 40 mmHg within 1 min of administration. Pretreatment with prazosin blocked this response by 62%. With clonidine the pre-cocaine MAP was lower and the hypertensive effect of cocaine was blocked by 50%, indicating an important role for central alpha-adrenergic mechanisms. In isolated rat carotid arteries cocaine-induced vasoconstriction was completely blocked by prazosin, phentolamine, and 6-hydroxydopamine, indicating a clear role for a peripheral effect. However, the relative contribution of the central alpha-adrenergic mechanism to the total vasoconstrictive response of cocaine was not clarified. 1999 Academic Press.
Postpartum is known to be an important risk factor for stroke. Bromocriptine may induce cerebral angiopathy.
We report the case of a 26-year-old postpartum woman who presented with headaches, seizures, hypertension and acute renal failure eight days after the beginning of a treatment with bromocriptine prescribed for lactation suppression. Brain MRI and MR angiogram excluded cortical vein thrombosis and revealed multiple abnormal areas of increased signal in the cortex with segmental arterial narrowings of intracranial vasculitis. The patient completely recovered within one week after drug withdrawal. Biological and radiological abnormalities were also reversible. Following the chronology bromocriptine was most likely responsible for this adverse cerebral and systemic event.
Clinicians should be aware of bromocripine-related postpartum cerebral angiopathy, a rarely described but serious complication of bromocriptine used to prevent postpartum breast engorgement.
The effects of the thiocarbamate fungicides, thiram, ziram, ferbam, maneb, and zineb, on norepinephrine synthesis by laying hens were investigated. Inhibition experiments with dopamine beta-hydroxylase purified from chicken adrenals indicated that thiram, ziram, and ferbam are potent competitive inhibitors with the substrate the substrate ascorbate. Maneb and zineb were without effect at comparable concentrations. Experiments investigating the interaction of thiram, ziram, and ferbam with cupric ions suggested that these compounds probably inhibit the enzyme by complexing the fully oxidized copper at its active site. Maneb and zineb also complexed cupric ions in solution and thus their failure to inhibit is not due to their inability to complex copper. When tested in vivo, thiram, ziram, and ferbam at po doses of 2.5 mg/kg or greater significantly reduced the conversion of radioactive dopa, given systemically, to brain norepinephrine. Since they did not affect the uptake of radioactive dopa by the brain or its subsequent decarboxylation within the brain to yield dopamine, these three compounds inhibit cerebral dopamine beta-hydroxylase in vivo. In contrast maneb and zineb at a po dose of 20 mg/kg had no significant effect on brain norepinephrine synthesis. Previously published results (Weppelman et al., Biol. Reprod. 23, 40-46, 1980) demonstrated that thiram, ziram, and ferbam (but not maneb or zineb) have antifertility action in laying hens. The correlation between this action and inhibition of dopamine beta-hydroxylase suggests that the antifertility effects of thiram, ziram, and ferbam might result from their antiadrenergic action. The observation that all doses of thiram in the diet which caused significant antigonadal action when fed to laying hens for 1 week also significantly decreased central and peripheral stores of norepinephrine supports this conclusion.
A paradoxical increase in suicide threats, paranoid ideation, and demanding and assaultive behavior occurred among 15 borderline inpatients receiving amitriptyline in a double-blind study. This pattern differed significantly from that of 14 nonresponding patients receiving placebo.
Veralipride, an antidopaminergic drug commonly prescribed to counteract postmenopausal symptoms, may cause reversible parkinsonism. A 49-year-old healthy woman reported a 5 month history of progressive slowing of voluntary movements, postural changes, e.g. sit-to-stand manouevres, and gait. Clinical examination revealed moderate hypokinesia, hypomimia and plastic rigidity of the four limbs. Locomotor oscillations of the upper limbs were decreased. She had been taking 100 mg of veralipride daily to counteract postmenopausal symptoms (vasomotor flushes and irritability) for 17 months uninterruptedly. The drug was withdrawn. The patient's clinical picture fully normalized within 20 days. One year later she reported to be still asymptomatic. This seems to be a case of parkinsonism induced by veralipride, a drug known to cause other extrapiramidal signs such as bucco-facial or limb dyskinesia. To our knowledge, only one other such case has been published (a 77-year-old French woman who had been taking veralipride, prazepam and nicergolin). In both cases, the drug had been administered for longer and without intervals. In our patient the motor disturbances could not have been associated with either advanced age or interaction with concurrent medications. Therefore, this case is suspected for veralipride-associated parkinsonism. In conclusion, intoxication should be thought in case of parkinsonism arising in women taking this drug.
One of the major side effects of lithium is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The established treatment for the disorder is thiazide diuretics, which are associated with hypokalemia and reduced lithium excretion, predisposing the patient to lithium toxicity. Amiloride is a new diuretic that reduces lithium-induced polyuria in animals without affecting lithium or potassium levels. The authors found that 10-20 mg/day of amiloride given to eight patients who had become hypokalemic while being treated with hydrochlorothiazide for lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus increased renal concentrating ability and reduced polyuria. They conclude that amiloride can be useful in treating lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and merits future randomized clinical trials.
Flecainide (100 mg twice daily) was used for prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) in 52 patients with frequent symptomatic attacks that were resistant or intolerant to quinidine (600-900 mg/day). Underlying heart disease was present in only 8 cases and left ventricular ejection fraction was always greater than 30%. No patient had had a myocardial infarction. Vagally induced PAF was clinically documented in 35 patients. Amiodarone, previously used and ineffective, was combined with flecainide in 33 patients. After 1-5.8 years of follow-up, complete disappearance of PAF was observed in 38 patients (73%). The success rate was slightly higher in patients with vagally induced PAF (p = 0.07). Extracardiac side effects necessitated withdrawal in only 3 cases. Permanent pacemaker was needed in 7 patients on amiodarone and flecainide because of excessive sinus bradycardia. Two patients, with previously documented atrial flutter, experienced presyncopal episodes of atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular (AV) conduction and wide QRS complex. No death occurred during the follow-up. In this series, quinidine proved to be unsuccessful in 46 patients and it was withdrawn in 6. We concluded that flecainide is efficient and well tolerated for long-term prevention of PAF in patients resistant to quinidine. The possibility of 1:1 AV conduction during atrial flutter may suggest the use of verapamil or beta blockers in combination with flecainide in patients with previously documented atrial flutter.
Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, in lymphocytes by the immunosuppressive environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8,-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been shown to cause thymic atrophy in every species studied. We set out to identify the specific hemopoietic cellular populations in which the AHR was activated to lead to thymic atrophy and to determine the effect of AHR activation in those cellular populations. Initially, we examined whether AHR activation in intrathymic dendritic cells could mediate TCDD-induced thymic atrophy. It was found that thymic atrophy occurred only when the AHR could be activated in the thymocytes but not hemopoietic-derived dendritic cells or other APCs. We next analyzed the effect of TCDD on the proliferation of thymocytes in vivo. There was a significant increase in the percentage of thymocytes in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and a significant decrease in the percentage of S plus G(2)/M thymocytes, especially in the CD4(-)CD8(-)CD3(-) triple-negative intrathymic progenitor cell population 24 h after exposure to 30 micro g/kg TCDD. Furthermore, by 12 h after exposure to TCDD, we observed approximately 60% reduction of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation in specific intrathymic progenitor cell populations. This reduction persisted for at least 6 days. These data indicate that intrathymic progenitor cells are direct targets of TCDD in the thymus and suggest that TCDD causes thymic atrophy by reducing entrance into cell cycle in these populations.
Optical reflection spectroscopy is a simple and quick method for the quantification of colour intensity, and is thus suitable for the determination of changes in skin reddening (erythema) due to local vasodilatation. To quantify the time course of this erythema, the oxyhaemoglobin absorption double peak with maxima at 542 and 577 nm is an appropriate parameter. A compact handheld optical spectrometer makes the technique applicable to clinical use, an example being the niacin patch test described herein. This noninvasive test provides information about the cell membrane metabolism via the skin flush induced by niacin (vitamin B3) and mediated by prostaglandin. The aim of this study was to adapt optical reflection spectroscopy to the requirements of the clinical niacin patch test. To that end, we investigated 60 healthy volunteers. Analysis of the spectroscopic data with regard to physiological covariables of niacin sensitivity revealed faster and more intense erythema in females--a gender effect that to our knowledge has not previously been reported. In the light of these results, the findings of other researchers based on semi-quantitative test methods should be reassessed, with consideration given to the gender effect.
The exact mechanism of the protective role of Resveratrol (Res) in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress is not well elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the potential benefits and possible mechanisms of Res on the amelioration of oxidative stress and hepatic steatosis in a KKAy mouse model.
A total of 30 KKAy male mice were randomly divided into three groups: a normal chow group, a low resveratrol group and a high resveratrol group. After a 12-wk study period, serum levels of TG, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C, the liver content of TG and TC, ROS, GSH, GPx, SOD and MDA levels were measured. Ectopic lipid deposition was observed in sectioned frozen liver tissues. The mRNA levels of ATGL and HSL in the liver tissues were determined via real-time PCR. Furthermore, the protein expression of p47phox, gp91phox, ATGL, HSL, Sirt1, AMPK and FOXO1 were analyzed using western blotting.
Following Res supplementation, serum levels of TG and MDA were decreased, while the HDL-C and SOD levels were increased in KKAy mice. Furthermore, Res treatment increased GSH and GPx in liver tissues, while it decreased ROS. In addition, Res significantly reduced hepatic steatosis. After Res treatment, concentrations of p47phox (membrane) and gp91phox proteins were reduced, while p-HSL, HSL and ATGL protein expression levels were increased. Mechanistically, the levels of Sirt1, p-AMPK and p-FOXO1 expression in the liver tissues were up-regulated following supplementation with Res, and FOXO1 protein was released from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.
Res is able to attenuate hepatic steatosis and lipid metabolic disorder and enhance the antioxidant ability in KKAy mice, possibly by up-regulating Sirt1 expression and the phosphorylation of AMPK.
To assess the involvement of spinal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in inflammation and nociception.
The time course of iNOS mRNA expression in rat spinal cord and inflamed paw was assessed by means of quantitative real time RT-PCR. In addition, the effects of the iNOS inhibitor L-NIL on inflammatory paw edema and thermal hyperalgesia were studied in comparison to those of the NO-donor RE-2047. L-NIL (3, 9, 27 and 81 mg/kg) and RE-2047 (3, 9 and 27 mg/kg) or vehicle were administered orally 15 min prior to the intraplantar injection of 0.625 mg zymosan.
Following zymosan injection, mRNA expression of iNOS increased in the inflamed paw and spinal cord with a maximum at 2.5 and 4 h, respectively. In the spinal cord iNOS mRNA started to decline at 10 h whereas it remained at maximum in the inflamed paw up to the end of the observation period of 24 h. As expected, RE-2047 had significant pronociceptive and proinflammatory effects. L-NIL significantly reduced paw inflammation at 27 and 81 mg/kg but failed to reduce hyperalgesia at the doses tested.
The results show that iNOS is upregulated in the inflamed tissue and spinal cord with a similar time course. The effects obtained with L-NIL suggest that iNOS differently contributes to the inflammatory and nociceptive response induced by zymosan.
Systemic administration of the muscarinic-receptor antagonists atropine and scopolamine produces cognitive deficits in humans, nonhuman primates and rodents. In humans, these deficits resemble symptoms of dementia seen in Alzheimer's disease. The passive avoidance (PA) task has been one of the most frequently used animal models for studying cholinergic mechanisms in learning and memory. The present study examined the ability of two selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists WAY 100635 and NAD-299 (robalzotan) and two acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors tacrine and donepezil to attenuate the impairment of PA retention caused by the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine in the rat. Although demonstrating differences in their temporal kinetics, both WAY 100635 and NAD-299 attenuated the impairment of PA caused by scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg s.c.). Donepezil did not block the PA deficit caused by the 0.3 mg/kg dose of scopolamine, but it prevented the inhibitory effects of the 0.2 mg/kg dose of scopolamine. In contrast, tacrine was effective vs both the 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg doses of scopolamine. These results indicate that (1). a functional 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonism can attenuate the anterograde amnesia produced by muscarinic-receptor blockade, and (2). the AChE inhibitors tacrine and donepezil differ in their ability to modify muscarinic-receptor-mediated function in vivo. These results suggest that 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists may have a potential in the treatment of cognitive symptoms in psychopathologies characterized by reduced ACh transmission such as Alzheimer's disease.
