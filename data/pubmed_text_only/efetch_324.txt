The most common pediatric brain tumors are low-grade gliomas (LGGs). We used whole-genome sequencing to identify multiple new genetic alterations involving BRAF, RAF1, FGFR1, MYB, MYBL1 and genes with histone-related functions, including H3F3A and ATRX, in 39 LGGs and low-grade glioneuronal tumors (LGGNTs). Only a single non-silent somatic alteration was detected in 24 of 39 (62%) tumors. Intragenic duplications of the portion of FGFR1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and rearrangements of MYB were recurrent and mutually exclusive in 53% of grade II diffuse LGGs. Transplantation of Trp53-null neonatal astrocytes expressing FGFR1 with the duplication involving the TKD into the brains of nude mice generated high-grade astrocytomas with short latency and 100% penetrance. FGFR1 with the duplication induced FGFR1 autophosphorylation and upregulation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathways, which could be blocked by specific inhibitors. Focusing on the therapeutically challenging diffuse LGGs, our study of 151 tumors has discovered genetic alterations and potential therapeutic targets across the entire range of pediatric LGGs and LGGNTs.
For the early detection of myocardial damage associated with anthracycline therapy, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and radionuclide angiocardiography were used to assess cardiac function in 37 patients receiving anthracyclines (ie, adriamycin and daunorubicin at a total dose of 100-2,030 mg/m2). None of the patients developed clinical congestive heart failure. There were no significant changes of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters after anthracycline administration. The left ventricular ejection fraction did not change significantly on radionuclide angiocardiography. However, the 1/3 peak filling rate (PFR) corrected by the end-diastolic count (EDC) (1/3 PFR/EDC) and the 1/3 filling fraction (1/3 FF), the indices of early diastolic function, showed a significant decrease. These findings suggest that the 1/3 PFR/EDC and 1/3 FF determined by radionuclide imaging are useful for detecting silent myocardial damage induced by anthracyclines.
Parallel, chronic (24 months) multidose bioassays of the PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) Aroclors 1016, 1242, 1254, and 1260 in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats showed sex/Aroclor-dependent increases in hepatic tumors and decreases in extrahepatic tumors. To elucidate the PCB mode of action (MOA) involved, levels of a number of hypothesized mediators were measured in liver specimens collected at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and screened for correlation with late life hepatotumorigenesis (HT; mostly adenomas). Consistently correlated with HT were (1) tissue accumulations of SigmaPCBs (correlated in both sexes) and of dioxin equivalents (toxic equivalency [TEQ]; correlated in females only); (2) net activities of six groups of mixed function oxidases (MFOs), some PCB-induced, some PCB-repressed, as determined by differential metabolism of PCB congeners; (3) activities of deproteinated, reoxidized hepatic cytosols as catalysts for superoxide (O(2)(*-)) production, such activity having the chemical characteristics of redox-cycling quinones (RCQs), e.g., those derived from the glutathionylated estrogen catechols that were identified in the female rat livers; and (4) increased expression of the indicator of cell proliferation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The new findings, along with other recently reported relationships, were indicative of a MOA consisting of (1) SigmaPCB/TEQ accumulation in rat tissues; (2) SigmaPCB/TEQ repression of constitutive MFOs; (3) SigmaPCB/TEQ induction of other MFOs; (4) MFO-mediated formation of RCQs; (5) RCQ-mediated formation of O(2)(*-); (6) O(2)(*-) dismutation to H(2)O(2); and (7) H(2)O(2)-mediated mitotic signaling, resulting in the proliferation of spontaneously or otherwise initiated cells to form hepatic tumors, as in tumor promotion.
Central nervous system reactions to new quinolones, such as convulsions due to interaction with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), have attracted increased attention in Japan.
The safety of levofloxacin (LVX) was investigated in Japan by post-marketing surveillance and reviewing spontaneous reports.
Post-marketing surveillance was performed in 16,117 patients between 1994 and 1996. The incidence of adverse reactions was 1.3% (203/16,117), being comparable with that for ofloxacin or that shown by phase II/III studies. Among 4,977 patients receiving concomitant NSAID treatment, the overall incidence of adverse reactions and the incidence of neurological reactions (including convulsions) did not significantly differ from those in patients without anti-inflammatory therapy. Review of the spontaneous reports on convulsions showed that patients with nephropathy, patients over 75 years and patients with a history of convulsive diseases were more likely to develop convulsions during LVX therapy.
LVX should be used cautiously in patients with the above risk factors.
Glioblastoma-derived stem cells (GSCs) are responsible for the cancer resistance to therapies. We show here that GSC-enriched neurospheres are resistant to the treatment of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) due to the insufficient expression of the death receptor DR4 and DR5 and the overexpression of cellular Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1Î²-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP). However, treatment with cisplatin leads to the upregulation of DR5 and downregulation of c-FLIP and restores TRAIL apoptotic pathway in the neurospheres. This study suggests that the combined treatment of TRAIL and cisplatin can induce apoptosis in GSCs and thus provide an effective treatment of glioblastomas.
Restlessness can make dying unnecessarily difficult, not only for the patient himself, but also for his family and the physician in charge. Four cancer patients, three men aged 69, 80 and 66 and a woman aged 88, displayed severe terminal restlessness, caused by nicotine abstinence, hypoglycaemia, constipation and urinary retention, respectively. Suitable interventions helped the patients to die in peace and dignity. Facing restless terminal patients the physician should think of withdrawal symptoms, metabolic derangements, full bladder and (or) rectum and intoxication by drugs, frequently morphine. Interventions directed at those problems may bring surprising results.
Multidrug resistance protein 2 (Mrp2), Mrp3, adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter g5 (Abcg5) and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter g8 (Abcg8) have been identified as bile acid or cholesterol transporter in the enterocytes as well as hepatocytes. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate intestinal and hepatic adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter expressions during cholestasis.
Experiment 1: Rats were subjected to bile duct ligation or sham operation. Blood, liver and small intestines were obtained 24 and 72 h after operation. Experiment 2: Rats were divided into four groups as follows: (i) control group; (ii) diosgenin group (fed with diosgenin in diet [1%(wt/wt)] for 7 days); (iii) ethinyl estradiol group (received ethinyl estradiol [5 mg/kg daily] for 5 days); and (iv) diosgenin-ethinyl estradiol group (received ethinyl estradiol and diosgenin). After treatment, blood, bile, liver and intestines were obtained. The mRNA related to lipid and bile acid metabolism was analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Intestinal Mrp2 and Abcg5/Abcg8 mRNA expression remarkably decreased 24 h after bile duct ligation (43% and 61%/54% of sham operation) and recovered 72 h after bile duct ligation (103% and 95%/83% of sham operation). Intestinal Mrp3 mRNA expression did not change after bile duct ligation. Intestinal Mrp2 mRNA expression was remarkably increased in diosgenin and diosgenin-ethinyl estradiol groups in comparison with the control group. There were no significant differences in intestinal Mrp3 mRNA expression among the four groups. Hepatic Mrp3 mRNA expression was remarkably increased in the D, EE and DE groups in comparison with the control group (531%, 321% and 1160% of control, respectively, P < 0.01). Hepatic Abcg5 and Abcg8 mRNA expression decreased in ethinyl estradiol and diosgenin-ethinyl estradiol groups compared with the control group and there were no differences in intestinal Abcg5 and Abcg8 mRNA expressions among the four groups.
Bile duct ligation affects not only hepatic but also the intestinal Mrp2 and Abcg5 and Abcg8 expressions. Intestinal Mrp2 mRNA level was regulated by factor in the lumen (e.g. diosgenin feeding). Cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol treatment was enhanced by diosgenin and the increase in hepatic Mrp3 mRNA level might affect the enhancement.
Isolated central nervous system involvement in Richter's syndrome (RS) is extremely rare and only 6 such cases have been described, so far. We report a 60-year-old woman with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) heavily pretreated with cladribine based regimens and rituximab in whom RS in the brain was first manifested as a stroke. Initial cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypodense area in the right parietal lobe showing no contrast enhancement. The follow-up CT done after 2 months showed an irregular, slightly hyperdense tumor surrounded by oedema with mass effect and midline shift. However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed no pathological changes. Neurosurgical operation was performed and the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been established on the basis of histological and immunological investigation of the tumor. The pattern of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in the patients' bone marrow aspirate and brain tumor was identical and suggested that both tumors originated from the same B-cell progenitors. The patient was then treated with brain irradiation (2000 cGy) and complete remission as assessed by MRI was achieved. Significant neurological improvement was observed and no clinical progression was stated 3 months after radiotherapy.
A series of 27 aryl/heteroaryl/aralkyl/aroyl piperazines were synthesized, and most of these compounds reduced prostate weight of mature rats by 15-47%. Three compounds, 10, 12, and 18, had better activity profile (reduced prostate weight by 47%, 43%, and 39%, respectively) than the standard drug flutamide (24% reduction). QSAR suggested structures with more cyclic and branched moieties, increased topological separation of O and N therein, and reduced solvation connectivity index for better activity. Pharmacokinetic study with compound 10 at an oral dose of 10.0 mg/kg indicated good absorption, negligible extrahepatic elimination, and rapid distribution to the target organ (prostate) but restricted entry through the blood-brain barrier. A 10-fold decrease in PSA and 15-fold increase in ER-Î² gene expressions of human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) by compound 10 in vitro indicated AR and ER-Î² mediated actions. The findings may stimulate further explorations of identified lead for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.
gamma-Acetylenic gamma-aminobutyric acid (gamma-acetylenic GABA) produces several-fold sustained elevations of brain GABA concentrations when administered intraperitoneally to mice. It protects mice against seizures induced by audiogenic stimuli, electroshock, thiosemicarbazide, isoniazid and strychnine. The duration and degree of audiogenic seizure protection appears to correlate with elevations in whole brain GABA levels. gamma-Acetylenic GABA does not protect against seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol or picrotoxin even at doses that increase brain GABA concentrations approximately 6-fold. This differential antiseizure activity suggests that the GABA system may play a role in some, but not all experimentally produced seizures.
Preemptive analgesia is currently in use in the management of postoperative pain and no more under search. The administration of ketamine as intraoperative analgesic agent is well-known since a long time; the analgesic properties of this drug are related to its actions as a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors antagonist; these receptors present an excitatory function on pain transmission and this binding seems to prevent or reverse the central sensitisation of every kind of pain, including postoperative pain. In literature, the use of this anesthetic for the preemptive analgesia in the management of postoperative pain is controversial; for this reason the aim of our study was the clinical evaluation of preemptive perioperative analgesia with low-doses ketamine.
This trial involved 40 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with the same surgical operator; postoperative analgesia was performed with the intraoperative administration of ketamine (0.7 mg/kg) or tramadol (15 mg/kg). A randomized, double-blind study was performed; after an inhalatory/analgesic general anesthesia (sevofluorane + remifentanyl) the postoperative-pain control was clinically evaluated through algometric measurements (Visual Analog Scale, Verbal Rating Scale, Pain Intensity Difference); supplemental doses of tramadol were administered if required, also to quantify the adequacy of analgesia, and adverse effects were evaluated.
The results show that preemptive intraoperative analgesia with ketamine produces a good analgesia at the awakening, despite low duration (approximately 1 hour), and upgrades the analgesic effect of tramadol in the postoperative period. Among the adverse effects, some (for example nausea) were related to the administration of both analgesics and to the kind of surgery, others (hallucinosis, nystagmus, photophobia, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms) were due to ketamine, and others (respiratory depression and hypotension) could be related to tramadol. Although the adverse effects due to ketamine are more numerous than those related to tramadol, the second could potentially be more dangerous.
Our study suggests that preemptive low-doses ketamine is able to produce an adequate postoperative analgesia and increases the analgesic effect of tramadol; furthermore, ketamine adverse effects could be reduced by intraoperative administration of benzodiazepines and/or antiemetic drugs, or by the association of ketamine and a peripheral analgesic (ketorolac).
The regulating effects of TCM treatments including clearing away heat and toxic materials, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, and strengthening the spleen and regulating qi on the oncogene transcription were observed in the liver cancer model rats. The preliminary results indicated that the mRNA levels of H-ras N-ras and K-ras, and signal molecules correlated with the ras/MAPK signal transduction pathway were down-regulated by the different TCM treatments in varying degrees. Also, the regulating effects of the treatments on differently-displayed genes were discrepant. It is suggested that the molecular mechanisms of the TCM treatments for liver cancer was complex with different target genes.
This study investigates the hypothesis that indomethacin's ability to prevent "fever" following burn injury in rats is mediated via decreased plasma concentrations of IL-6, the putative mediator of increased body temperature. Sprague-Dawley rats had radio transmitters and osmotic pumps containing indomethacin placed in the peritoneal cavity. Seven days later full thickness scald burns to 50% of the body surface area were produced. Following burn injuries, daily blood samples were obtained from a carotid catheter for assay of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6. In addition, body temperature (T(B)) and activity index were obtained every five minutes by telemetry. There were four experimental groups: burn + indomethacin (B-In); burn + polyethylene glycol (Peg) (B-Peg); control + indomethacin (C-In); and control + Peg (C-Peg). Burned animals demonstrated a significant two-fold increase in plasma IL-1alpha levels (p=0.004) and a seven-fold increment in IL-6 (p=0.0001) through the 7th PBD, and indomethacin administration had no significant effect upon the cytokine plasma levels. There were no significant increases in IL-1beta, TNF-alpha or LPS in any group. Indomethacin eliminated the chronic increase in T(B) following burn injury, and this effect was not produced by changes in plasma levels of the endogenous pyrogens IL-1alpha and IL-6.
We investigated on colon cancer cells the effect of geraniol on thymidylate synthase and thymidine kinase expression, two enzymes related to 5-fluorouracil cytotoxicity. The anti-tumoral efficacy of geraniol and 5-fluorouracil were also evaluated on TC-118 human tumors transplanted in Swiss nu/nu mice. Geraniol (150 microM) but not 5-fluorouracil caused a 2-fold reduction of thymidylate synthase and thymidine kinase expression in cancer cells. In nude mice, the combined administration of 5-fluorouracil (20 mg/kg) and geraniol (150 mg/kg) caused a 53% reduction of the tumor volume, whereas a 26% reduction was obtained with geraniol alone, 5-fluorouracil alone showed no effect.
An atypical depression, resembling beta-phenylethylamine (PEA) deficiency states, frequently complicates methadone withdrawal. We undertook a study of 24-h urinary free PEA excretion in steady-dosed and withdrawing methadone patients, hypothesizing that abstinent patients would excrete less PEA than controls and that methadone would show a dose-dependent effect on PEA turnover. As hepatic dysfunction, frequent in methadone patients, might affect PEA turnover, we also evaluated liver chemistries, [13C]aminopyrine excretion, 2-hydroxylation of estradiol, and 'blind', global severity ratings in each subject. PEA excretion did not significantly differ between eight fully detoxified methadone patients (median 4.76 micrograms/24 h) and seven normal controls (median 5.80 micrograms/24 h). Moreover, PEA excretion bore no relation to methadone dosage among 24 steady-dosed subjects. PEA excretion in seven withdrawing subjects each receiving 4-8 different doses of methadone similarly showed no relation to dose. Despite significant liver disease, several measures of impairment did not correlate with PEA excretion. These findings argue against a role for PEA deficiency in withdrawal depression.
Twelve patients with primary small intestinal lymphoma were followed prospectively for 3 years. Endoscopic abnormalities were diagnostic of lymphoma in all cases where the duodenum was involved (83%). In three cases (25%) the disease extended to the stomach. One patient (8%) had diffuse small cell cleaved and 11 (92%) diffuse large cell lymphoma stages I (8%), II (25%), III (58%) and IV (8%). Nine of them were unresectable and primarily treated with combination chemotherapy; 67% achieved complete remission, 22% partial response and 11% no response. Only one patient relapsed and achieved a second remission. All complete remission patients are currently alive and free of disease at a median follow-up of 36 months. Overall survival for all patients is 58%, and disease-free survival is 50%. No instance of chemotherapy-related bleeding or perforation was seen. Tetracycline was necessary for the treatment of IPSID-associated diarrhea and malabsorption in spite of cytotoxic chemotherapy.
We report a case of symptomatic epidural lipomatosis in a 36-year-old man following a heart lung transplant and 3.5 years of steroid medication. A review of the pertinent literature emphasises the importance of including this diagnosis in the differential diagnosis of patients receiving steroid medication or markedly obese patients with back pain or symptoms suggesting spinal cord or cauda equina compression.
Dendritic degeneration is a common pathology in temporal lobe epilepsy and its animal models. However, little is known when and how the degeneration occurs. In the present study of the rat pilocarpine model, visualization of dendrites of the hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs) by biocytin revealed a generalized spine loss immediately after the acute seizure induced by pilocarpine. However, this generalized damage was followed by recovery and plastic changes in spine shape and density, which occurred 15-35 days after the initial acute seizure, i.e., during the period of establishing a chronic phase of this model with the induction of spontaneous seizures. The present finding suggests that initial acute seizures do not cause permanent damages in dendrites and spines of DGCs; instead, dendritic spines are dynamically maintained in the course of the establishment and maintenance of spontaneous seizures. Local dendritic spine degeneration, detected later in the chronic phase of epilepsy, is likely to have a separate cause from initial acute insults.
5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-related metabolic enzymes, including dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), thymidylate synthase (TS), thymidylate phosphorylase (TP), and orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT) are initial, rate-limiting enzymes in the metabolism of 5-FU. The therapeutic implications of these enzymes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood. We used a newly developed laser-captured microdissection technique combined with RNA extraction to examine the mRNA levels of 5-FU-related metabolic enzymes in HCC and adjacent liver tissue.
The study material comprised 43 paired specimens of HCC and adjacent liver tissue. The mRNA levels of 5-FU-related metabolic enzymes were quantified by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction combined with laser-captured microdissection.
The DPD mRNA level in HCC (4.31 +/- 4.21) was lower than that in adjacent liver (6.53 +/- 2.93) (p < 0.001). The TS mRNA level in HCC (3.55 +/- 2.54) was higher than that in adjacent liver (1.90 +/- 0.11) p < 0.001). The TP and the OPRT mRNA levels did not differ significantly between HCC and adjacent liver. The TS mRNA level of HCC with portal invasion (4.47 +/- 2.76) was higher than that of HCC without portal invasion (2.71 +/- 1.96) (p = 0.015). The DPD mRNA level of HCC with septum formation (4.89 +/- 4.82) was significantly higher than that of HCC without septum formation (2.12 +/- 0.61) (p < 0.027). The OPRT mRNA level of poorly differentiated HCC (1.18 +/- 0.49) was lower than that of moderately or well-differentiated HCC (2.42 +/- 1.82) (p = 0.037).
The DPD mRNA level was lower and the TS mRNA level was higher in HCC than in adjacent liver. Our results will hopefully stimulate further investigations designed to optimize the use of 5-FU in patients with HCC.
Prostaglandins (PGs) are suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of different bladder disorders and it has been demonstrated that cyclooxygenase-2 expression is increased as a consequence of bladder outflow obstruction. We investigated whether the PGE2 receptor EP1 is involved in the regulation of normal micturition, the response to intravesical PGE2 administration, and the development of bladder hypertrophy and overactivity due to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO).
Moderate BOO was created in EP1 receptor knockout (EP1KO) mice and their WT counterparts. After 1 week cystometry was performed in conscious animals before and after PGE2 instillation. Findings were compared to those in unobstructed control animals. Bladder wet weight was measured to document the degree of hypertrophy after BOO.
There was no difference between unobstructed EP1KO and WT mice in urodynamic parameters but EP1KO mice did not respond to intravesical PGE2 instillation, while WT mice showed detrusor overactivity. The lack of EP1 receptor did not prevent bladder hypertrophy due to BOO. After BOO WT mice had pronounced detrusor overactivity, while this was negligible in EP1KO mice.
The EP1 receptor appears not to be essential for normal micturition or the mediation of bladder hypertrophy due to BOO but it seems to have a role in the development of detrusor overactivity caused by PGE2 and outlet obstruction.
Pyrimethamine (PM) plus sulfadoxine (SD) is the last remaining affordable drug for treating uncomplicated malaria in Africa. The selective pressure exerted by the slowly eliminated combination PM/SD was compared with that exerted by the more rapidly eliminated combination chlorproguanil/dapsone (CPG/Dap) on Kenyan Plasmodium falciparum. Point mutations were analyzed in dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase and in the genetic diversity of 3 genes in isolates collected before and after CPG/Dap and PM/SD treatments. PM/SD was associated strongly with the disappearance of fully drug-sensitive parasites and with a significant increase in the prevalence of resistant parasites in subsequent parasitemias. However, this was not a characteristic of treatment with CPG/Dap. Moreover, most of the patients who returned with recrudescent infections were in the PM/SD-treated group. The data predict a longer useful therapeutic life for CPG/Dap than for PM/SD, and, thus, CPG/Dap is a preferable alternative for treatment of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer death in the USA. Recurrence rates are high after front-line therapy and most patients eventually die from platinum (Pt) - resistant disease. Cisplatin resistance is associated with increased nucleotide excision repair (NER), decreased mismatch repair (MMR) and decreased platinum uptake. The objective of this study is to investigate how a novel combination of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) and hyperthermia (43Â°C) affect mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.
We established a murine model of metastatic EOC by intraperitoneal injection of A2780/CP70 human ovarian cancer cells into nude mice. We developed a murine hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy model to treat the mice. Mice with peritoneal metastasis were perfused for 1 h with 3 mg/kg cisplatin Â± 26 mg/kg NaAsO2 at 37 or 43Â°C. Tumors and tissues were collected at 0 and 24 h after treatment.
Western blot analysis of p53 and key NER proteins (ERCC1, XPC and XPA) and MMR protein (MSH2) suggested that cisplatin induced p53, XPC and XPA and suppressed MSH2 consistent with resistant phenotype. Hyperthermia suppressed cisplatin-induced XPC and prevented the induction of XPA by cisplatin, but it had no effect on Pt uptake or retention in tumors. NaAsO2 prevented XPC induction by cisplatin; it maintained higher levels of MSH2 in tumors and enhanced initial accumulation of Pt in tumors. Combined NaAsO2 and hyperthermia decreased cisplatin-induced XPC 24 h after perfusion, maintained higher levels of MSH2 in tumors and significantly increased initial accumulation of Pt in tumors. ERCC1 levels were generally low except for NaAsO2 co-treatment with cisplatin. Systemic Pt and arsenic accumulation for all treatment conditions were in the order: kidney > liver = spleen > heart > brain and liver > kidney = spleen > heart > brain respectively. Metal levels generally decreased in systemic tissues within 24 h after treatment.
NaAsO2 and/or hyperthermia have the potential to sensitize tumors to cisplatin by inhibiting NER, maintaining functional MMR and enhancing tumor platinum uptake.
Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide especially among young children, women in pregnancy and breastfeeding. This study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of ID in 1288 pupil ranging in age from 11 to 14 years. Haemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), serum iron (Fe) serum transferrin (Trf), serum ferritin (Ft) and an inflammtory proteic profil (IPP) were measured. The IPP combines the analysis of protein variations: protein results are converted in percent of normal values referenced for the technique used. It has been suggested that on the protein profile, an increase in serum transferrin level compared to a normal serum albumin level (DAT: difference albumin-transferrin), appears early in the course of ID. Iron deficiency was defined by a low serum ferritin (< 15 ng/mL) and/or a pathologic DAT (> 28%). Approximately, 33.8% of children had Ft < 15 ng/mL and 12,8% had DAT > 28% while ferritin values were in the normal range. Diagnosis performance (sensitivity, specificity and diagnosis efficacy) of ferritin and DAT were compared to the performance of high serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) values in 2 populations presenting or not a biological inflammation. Only the diagnosis efficacy of DAT was constant in both situations. In conclusion, the serum ferritin concentration is the first indicator of body storage iron identifying ID, however normal or elevated values of ferritin may be difficult to interpret particulary in the presence of inflammation. sTfR and DAT values are thus reliable indicators of ID in such circumstances.
It has been suggested that a susceptibility locus near the gene encoding the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) contributes to individual differences in human addiction vulnerability. BDNF modulates several behaviors that are associated with addictive drugs, and upregulation of BDNF was found to be associated with several drugs of abuse such as amphetamine, cocaine, and nicotine. In this study, we addressed the question if a common BDNF missense variation (Val66Met) influences the risk for smoking behavior in otherwise healthy human volunteers.
In total, 320 healthy unrelated volunteers (155 male, 165 female, mean age: 38.4 +/- 14.1 years) consisting of 43.3% never smokers, 20.9% former smokers, and 35.6% current smokers were investigated.
The frequency of both Met/Met genotype and Met allele was significantly increased in current and in former smokers when compared to never smokers (chi (2) = 10.856, df = 2, p = 0.004 and chi (2) = 4.350, df = 1, p = 0.045, respectively).
Our results suggest that humans who carry the Met allele of the BDNF missense polymorphism might be more vulnerable to initiate and also maintain smoking.
