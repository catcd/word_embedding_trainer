Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) have been shown to induce tumors in several organs of rodents, but except for MeIQ and PhIP, other HCAs such as MeIQx and IQ consistently failed to induce colon tumors in mice, whereas MeIQ, IQ, and PhIP exerted colon tumorigenicity in rats. Recently, we found that dietary MeIQx induces genotoxicity in the colon as well as the liver of two different types of reporter gene transgenic mice at subcarcinogenic doses such as 300 ppm. However, in the present study, dietary MeIQx did not significantly induce any tumors in C57BL/6J mice or gpt delta mice even when fed at 300 ppm for 78 weeks, suggesting that the treatment of MeIQx alone was not sufficient to promote colon tumors. In order to clarify a possibility whether such HCAs can induce colon tumors, C57BL/6J mice were fed MeIQx, IQ, or PhIP at a dose of 300 ppm for 12 weeks and, thereafter, twice received 1-week treatment with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), 2 weeks apart. After 20 weeks, colon tumors including adenocarcinomas were found at incidences of 22%, 24%, and 45% in the groups receiving MeIQx, IQ, and PhIP, respectively, which were significantly (p < 0.05 or 0.01) different from the DSS alone value (0%). Thus our results clearly indicate that, in addition to PhIP, MeIQx and IQ can induce colon tumors in mice under an experimental condition promoting colon tumors.
Antithyreoid drugs are known causative agents of agranulocytosis and, in rare cases, aplastic anaemia as well. This is a case report of a female patient with secondary aplastic anaemia developed two years after continual use of thiamazole. She suffered from exhaustion and massive epistaxis. Physical examination revealed pale skin and mucous membranes, skin hematomas (body and legs) and high body temperature--39 degrees C. At admission, her blood film revealed pancytopaenia with 75 g/l hemoglobin concentration, 1.0 x 10(9)/l leukocytes and severe thrombocytopaenia--7.0 x 10(9)/l. Differential count showed 91% of lymphocytes, 1% of monocytes and only 8% of neuthrophils. Bone marrow cytology and pathohistologic findings revealed severe hypocellularity, replaced with fat cells and only 10% of active hematopoietic tissue. In the acute phase of illness, in vitro growth of bone marrow progenitors was completely absent. Treatment was initiated with prednisone and danazol. During that time, she suffered from epistaxis, gastro-intestinal bleeding and herpes infection. Due to therapeutic failure cyclosporine A was added after 21 days. There upon, slow recovery ensued. After two months, she was discharged from hospital with stable blood film findings (HB 83 g/l, WBC 4.6 x 10(9)/l, and PLT 30.0 x 10(9)/l). She was forbidden thiamazole for her life time. After recovery from the acute phase of illness, in vitro haematopoietic precursor cells examination was repeated. The number of CFU-E colonies stimulated with 1 IU EPO was decreased in comparison with the control values. Upon adding 100 micro/l of thiamazole (5 mg/ml concentration e.g. 500 mg per culture), the growth of CFU-E was completely prevented, followed by marked cytotoxicity signs. The treatment including low doses (5 mg/ kg body weight daily) of cyclosporine A administration was continued on outpatient basis. After one year, blood film showed almost normal results with 120 g/l hemoglobin concentration, 4.3x10(9)/l leukocytes and mild thrombocytopaenia 72.0 x 10(9)/l. She was transfusion free.
Interferon-associated depression is a frequent side effect of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C. The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between platelet serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) concentrations and IFN-induced depression.
The study represents a secondary analysis of a previously published trial on the efficacy of SSRI medication in HCV patients on IFN therapy. Ninety-three patients were longitudinally assessed for depression and platelet serotonin. Evaluation time points were: prior to IFN therapy, at weeks 4, 12, and 24 of IFN treatment, and 4 weeks after antiviral treatment. Depression was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Platelet serotonin concentrations were measured by ELISA.
Platelet serotonin concentrations were significantly decreased during interferon therapy (p=0.001) in 74 of the 93 patients (79.6%). Clinically relevant depression occurred in 33.3% of patients - however, IFN-induced depression was not significantly linked to either baseline 5-HT concentrations or kinetics. In the subgroup of patients with IFN-induced depression who received the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram (20 mg daily, n=17), serotonin levels declined further during anti-depressant medication, becoming statistically significant within the first 2 weeks (p<0.001) of SSRI treatment.
We demonstrate a significant impact of IFN and SSRI intake on platelet serotonin levels, suggesting a biochemical analogy between 5-HT metabolism in blood platelets and the CNS. Platelet 5-HT levels might serve as a surrogate marker for patient adherence to antiviral and anti-depressant medication. For the prediction of IFN-induced depression, however, platelet 5-HT measurements are not suitable.
Previous research has shown that killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) inhabiting a creosote-contaminated site on the Elizabeth River in Virginia exhibit little induction of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) protein expression and activity upon exposure to typical CYP1A-inducing chemicals. We characterized the CYP1A response of first, second, and third generation laboratory-raised offspring of feral Elizabeth River killifish to exposure to sediments from the contaminated site as well as the prototypical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-type CYP1A inducers beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC). The Elizabeth River offspring's responses were compared to those of offspring of killifish from two reference sites (King's Creek, Virginia, and Russell Creek, North Carolina). As with feral Elizabeth River killifish, the first generation embryos and larvae were refractory to CYP1A induction. However, the response observed in 3-year-old first generation adults, as well as with second and third generation fish, was much closer to that observed in reference-site fish. We suggest that the pattern of altered CYP1A response in Elizabeth River killifish, while persistent and heritable for one generation, is mostly nongenetically based. Additionally, we investigated the hypothesis that low CYP1A activity (measured as in ovo EROD activity) would correlate to increased survival in Elizabeth River sediment pore water; this hypothesis was not supported by our results.
In the present study, we showed the correlation of EZH2, SUV39H1 or G9a expression and histone modifications with the urethane induced mouse lung tumorigenesis in the presence or absence of antitumor agent, inositol hexaphosphate (IP6). Tumorigenesis and the molecular events involved therein were studied at 1, 4, 12 or 36 weeks after the exposure. There were no tumors at 1 or 4 weeks but tumors started appearing at 12 weeks and grew further till 36 weeks after urethane exposure. Among the molecular events, upregulation of EZH2 and SUV39H1 expressions appeared to be time dependent, but G9a expression was altered significantly only at later stages of 12 or 36 weeks. Alteration in miR-138 expression supports the upregulation of its target, EZH2. H3K9me2, H3K27me3 or H4K20me3 was found to be altered at 12 or 36 weeks. However, ChIP analysis of p16 and MLH1 promoters showed their binding with H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 which was maximum at 36 weeks. Thus, histone modification and their interactions with gene promoter resulted in the reduced expression of p16 and MLH1. IP6 prevented the incidence and the size of urethane induced lung tumors. IP6 also prevented the urethane induced alterations in EZH2, SUV39H1, G9a expressions and histone modifications. Our results suggest that the alterations in the histone modification pathways involving EZH2 and SUV39H1 expressions are among the early events in urethane induced mouse lung tumorigenesis and could be exploited for cancer control.
The effects of changes in left ventricular mass following beta-adrenergic blockade therapy (sotalol) on left ventricular filling indices were examined in 16 patients with essential hypertension aged 46 +/- 8.3 years (mean +/- s.d.). The peak atrial to peak early diastolic velocity (A:E) ratio and the peak filling rate (PFR = peak early diastolic velocity X mitral annulus area) were measured by the use of pulsed Doppler left ventricular inflow time-velocity plots following placebo and after 8-12 weeks of sotalol monotherapy (160 mg/day). Compared with normal controls of similar age, our patients had a larger left ventricular mass and impaired left ventricular filling indices. Following sotalol, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by 14%, the heart rate by 15% and left ventricular mass by 11%, while diastolic filling improved (A:E 17% and PFR 21%). Six patients had a decrease in left ventricular mass of greater than 15% (group A); other patients (group B) showed a smaller reduction. In spite of comparable changes in MAP and heart rate in groups A and B, the patients in group A showed a smaller degree of improvement in the A:E ratio. It is concluded that sotalol can induce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and improve left ventricular filling in hypertensive patients, and it seems that improvement in diastolic filling is related to a reduction in afterload rather than to a decrease in left ventricular mass.
Patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who are unresponsive to corticosteroids require splenectomy, but if this fails, treatment is difficult. We tried to induce durable remissions in ITP patients refractory to corticosteroids before or after splenectomy by applying strong immunosuppression with the combination of cyclosporin A (CyA 5 mg/kg/d) and prednisone (0.4 mg/kg/d). Patients were assigned to one of two groups. Group 1, 10 patients refractory to prednisone; and group 2, 10 patients refractory to at least prednisone and splenectomy. Overall response rate was 55% (50% in group 1 and 60% in group 2 patients). Nine of the 10 patients in group 1 finally had a splenectomy because of relapse, insufficient response or toxicity of CyA. Thirty percent of the patients discontinued CyA because of side-effects; hypertension, severe headache and muscle pain being the most frequent encountered. It is concluded that CyA treatment does not avoid, but only postpones, splenectomy in chronic ITP patients who are refractory to corticosteroids. However, CyA can be useful in a subgroup of patients with corticosteroid- and splenectomy-refractory ITP, but treatment toxicity is high.
In this study, a model system was designed to investigate the metastatic potential of intramuscularly implanted bladder tumor cells in mice. Of the 4 FANFT-induced murine bladder tumors investigated, MBT-2 and -8 metastasized to the lung.
Previous studies have suggested that 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)2D3) induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in vitro, suggesting that vitamin D may be a useful adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer and a chemopreventive agent. Most epidemiological data however shows a weak link between serum 25(OH)D3 and risk of prostate cancer. To explore this dichotomy we have compared tumor progression in the LPB-Tag model of prostate in VDR knock out (VDRKO) and wild type (VDRWT) mice. On the C57BL/6 background LPB-Tag tumors progress significantly more rapidly in the VDRKO mice. VDRKO tumors show significantly higher levels of cell proliferation than VDRWT tumors. In mice supplemented with testosterone to restore the serum levels to the normal range, these differences in tumor progression, and proliferation are abrogated, suggesting that there is considerable cross-talk between the androgen receptor (AR) and the vitamin D axis which is reflected in significant changes in steady state mRNA levels of the AR, PCNA, cdk2 survivin and IGFR1 and 2 genes. These alterations may explain the differences between the in vitro data and the epidemiological studies.
In the present investigation, the cardiotoxic effects of three anthracycline analogs (doxorubicin, 4'-epi-doxorubicin and 4'-deoxy-doxorubicin) were compared. For this purpose, 9.0 mg/kg of doxorubicin, divided into three closely spaced subdoses, were injected intravenously in rats. The two derivatives were administered according to the same time schedule and their doses were chosen on the basis of the clinically adopted ratio, doxorubicin: 4'-epidoxorubicin: 4'-deoxy-doxorubicin = 1:1:0.5. The degree of cardiomyopathy induced by the three anthracyclines was evaluated by ECG changes and morphological alterations. Doxorubicin was found to produce a significant degree of cardiotoxicity, thus confirming the validity of the experimental model adopted. Both 4'-substituted derivatives proved to be less cardiotoxic than the parent compound, although not completely devoid of this side effect.
Cigarette smoking is common in societies worldwide and a growing body of evidence suggests that chronic cigarette smoking may affect the structure and function of cardiovascular system. The chronic exposure to high levels of nicotine, a major component of cigarette smoking, has been observed to play a pathogenic role in the induction and progression of cardiovascular disorders including cardiomyopathy and peripheral vascular disease. Nicotine alters the function of vascular endothelium, initiates the adhesion cascade and stimulates the vascular inflammatory events to induce atherosclerosis and hypertension. Moreover, nicotine has been noted to induce direct coronary spasm and ischemia, which develop coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. In addition, nicotine stimulates the excessive release of impulses from sinoatrial node that may account for the induction of cardiac arrhythmia. The present review critically discussed the possible detrimental role of chronic nicotine exposure in cardiac and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, the signaling mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of nicotine exposure-induced cardiovascular dysfunction have been discussed. In addition, the pharmacological interventions to ameliorate chronic nicotine exposure-induced cardiovascular abnormalities have been delineated.
Acrylamide (AA) has recently been reported to be spontaneously formed in fried and baked foods with various concentrations. Although carcinogenicity in humans is as yet equivocal, numerous positive genotoxicity data in vitro and in vivo and results of rat long-term carcinogenicity studies demonstrating tumor induction at multiple sites, like the mammary gland, thyroid and testes, suggest the risk with dietary exposure may not be negligible. In the present study, to establish a medium-term carcinogenesis model for screening of agents with the potential to modify AA effects on the mammary gland and thyroid, we pretreated rats with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), in combination with N-bis(2-hydroxypropyl)nitrosamine (DHPN), or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) alone and then administered AA at 20 and 40 ppm in the drinking water for 30 weeks. The incidence and multiplicity of mammary tumors were increased at the high dose (P<0.05) in MNU- but not DMBA+DHPN-treated rats. No thyroid tumors were induced in any case. The results indicate that the MNU model is suitable for detection of modifiers of AA actions.
Seventeen patients aged 26-52 with recurrent thromboembolism of the veins and disturbances of cerebral and coronary circulation (3 and 2 cases, respectively) treated by unfractionated heparin developed thrombocytopenia in the presence of enhanced platelet aggregation. Despite heparin therapy, fresh thrombi of different sites appeared in 5 patients. A cross to fraxiparin (France) resulted in correction of thrombocytopenia, normalization of spontaneous platelet aggregation in two thirds of the patients. In 5 patients thrombocytopenia persisted. It is stated that in most cases low-molecular heparin allows continuation of antithrombotic therapy in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Neither transplacental passage nor hemostatic abnormalities in the newborns were recorded after administration of fraxiparin to 6 pregnant women.
Intracellular Na(+) concentration ([Na(+)](i)) rises in the heart during ischemia, and on reperfusion, there is a transient rise followed by a return toward control. These changes in [Na(+)](i) contribute to ischemic and reperfusion damage through their effects on Ca(2+) overload. Part of the rise of [Na(+)](i) during ischemia may be caused by increased activity of the cardiac Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE1), activated by the ischemic rise in [H(+)](i). In support of this view, NHE1 inhibitors reduce the [Na(+)](i) rise during ischemia. Another possibility is that the rise of [Na(+)](i) during ischemia is caused by Na(+) influx through channels. We have reexamined these issues by use of two different NHE1 inhibitors, amiloride, and zoniporide, in addition to tetrodotoxin (TTX), which blocks voltage-sensitive Na(+) channels. All three drugs produced cardioprotection after ischemia, but amiloride (100 microM) and TTX (300 nM) prevented the rise in [Na(+)](i) during ischemia, whereas zoniporide (100 nM) did not. Both amiloride and zoniporide prevented the rise of [Na(+)](i) on reperfusion, whereas TTX was without effect. In an attempt to explain these differences, we measured the ability of the three drugs to block Na(+) currents. At the concentrations used, TTX reduced the transient Na(+) current (I (Na)) by 11 +/- 2% while amiloride and zoniporide were without effect. In contrast, TTX largely eliminated the persistent Na(+) current (I (Na,P)) and amiloride was equally effective, whereas zoniporide had a substantially smaller effect reducing I (Na,P) to 41 +/- 8%. These results suggest that part of the effect of NHE1 inhibitors on the [Na(+)](i) during ischemia is by blockade of I (Na,P). The fact that a low concentration of TTX eliminated the rise of [Na(+)](i) during ischemia suggests that I (Na,P) is a major source of Na(+) influx in this model of ischemia.
Lithium treated rats become polyuric and at the same time develop pronounced dilatations of distal tubular segments and characteristics enzyme histochemical changes. In the present study we have compared lithium-polyuric Wistar rats with lithium treated rats in which the polyuria was prevented either by administration of a vasopressin analogue or by water restriction. The kidneys were studied using enzyme histochemistry and light microscope morphometry. The characteristic lithium induced changes were present in all groups irrespective of the presence or absence of polyuria. It is concluded therefore, that the morphological and enzyme histochemical changes are induced by the lithium ion per se and not by the accompanying polyuria.
Previous work has shown that cholinomimetic drugs induce "vacuous" or non-directed jaw movements in rats. In the present study, five experiments were conducted to provide a pharmacological, anatomical and behavioral characterization of tacrine-induced vacuous jaw movements. In the first experiment, tacrine produced vacuous chewing in a dose-related manner in a range of 1.25 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg. This effect was reduced, also in a dose-related manner, by the co-administration of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine in a range of 0.125 to 1.0 mg/kg, but not by N-methylscopolamine. The fourth experiment examined the effect of scopolamine (2.5 to 10.0 micrograms) injected into the ventrolateral striatum on vacuous jaw movements induced by 5.0 mg/kg tacrine. Intrastriatal injections of scopolamine completely blocked tacrine-induced jaw movements. The fifth experiment utilized a slow-motion videotaping system to analyze the temporal characteristics of vacuous chewing induced by 5.0 mg/kg tacrine. The vast majority of the movements occurred in rapid "bursts," and analysis of interresponse times (i.e., the time between each jaw movement) showed that most of the jaw movements occurred within a local frequency range of 3 to 7 Hz. Thus, tacrine-induced jaw movements are reduced by antimuscarinic treatment, and most of these movements occur in the parkinsonian tremor frequency range. Tremulous jaw movements induced by tacrine in rats appear to share some characteristics with Parkinsonian tremor.
Azidothymidine (AZT)-induced anemia in mice can be reversed by the administration of IGF-IL-3 (fusion protein of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II) and interleukin 3). Although interleukin 3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin (EPO) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro, injection of IGF-IL-3 and EPO in AZT-treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF-IL-3 or EPO alone. We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL-3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells. Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF-IL-3. There was a significant reduction of thymidine incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre-treated with IGF-IL-3 and EPO. Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL-3 significantly reduced thymidine incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone. These results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with EPO and IL-3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production.
In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, we studied the effect of different i.v. induction drugs on tracheal intubation conditions and apnoea time after small-dose (0.6 mg kg(-1)) succinylcholine used to facilitate orotracheal intubation at an urban, university-affiliated community medical centre.
One hundred and seventy-five ASA I and II adult patients scheduled to undergo surgical procedures requiring general anaesthesia and tracheal intubation were allocated to one of five groups according to i.v. anaesthetic induction drug used. General anaesthesia was induced by i.v. administration of lidocaine 30 mg and propofol 2.5 mg kg(-1) (Group 1), thiopental 5 mg kg(-1) (Group 2), lidocaine 30 mg and thiopental 5 mg kg(-1) (Group 3), etomidate 0.3 mg kg(-1) (Group 4), or lidocaine 30 mg and etomidate 0.3 mg kg(-1) (Group 5). After loss of consciousness, succinylcholine 0.6 mg kg(-1) was given i.v. followed by direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation after 60 s. Measurements included intubation conditions recorded during laryngoscopy 60 s after succinylcholine administration, and apnoea time.
Overall, clinically acceptable intubation conditions were met in 168 out of the 175 patients studied (96%). They were met in 35/35 patients in Group 1, 33/35 patients in Group 2, 34/35 patients in Group 3, 33/35 patients in Group 4, and 33/35 patients in Group 5. Mean (SD) apnoea time was 4.0 (0.4), 4.2 (0.3), 4.2 (0.6), 4.1 (0.2) and 4.1 (0.2) min respectively in Groups 1-5. There were no differences in the intubation conditions or apnoea times between the groups.
The use of succinylcholine 0.6 mg kg(-1) produced the same favourable intubation conditions and a short apnoea time regardless of the induction drug used.
Aminoglycosides force read through of premature stop codon mutations and introduce new mutation-specific gene-corrective strategies in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A chronic treatment with gentamicin (32 mg/kg/daily i.p., 8-12 weeks) was performed in exercised mdx mice with the dual aim to clarify the dependence on dystrophin of the functional, biochemical and histological alterations present in dystrophic muscle and to verify the long term efficiency of small molecule gene-corrective strategies in work-loaded dystrophic muscle. The treatment counteracted the exercise-induced impairment of in vivo forelimb strength after 6-8 weeks. We observed an increase in dystrophin expression level in all the fibers, although lower than that observed in normal fibers, and found a concomitant recovery of aquaporin-4 at sarcolemma. A significant reduction in centronucleated fibers, in the area of necrosis and in the percentage of nuclear factor-kB-positive nuclei was observed in gastrocnemious muscle of treated animals. Plasma creatine kinase was reduced by 70%. Ex vivo, gentamicin restored membrane ionic conductance in mdx diaphragm and limb muscle fibers. No effects were observed on the altered calcium homeostasis and sarcolemmal calcium permeability, detected by electrophysiological and microspectrofluorimetric approaches. Thus, the maintenance of a partial level of dystrophin is sufficient to reinforce sarcolemmal stability, reducing leakiness, inflammation and fiber damage, while correction of altered calcium homeostasis needs greater expression of dystrophin or direct interventions on the channels involved.
The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, on autonomic function was assessed in a double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study in 10 normotensive males. Eight milligram of perindopril given orally lowered blood pressure without a change in heart rate. Perindopril enhanced the vagally mediated heart rate variation with deep breathing. There was no impairment of the responses to either bicycle exercise at 175 W for 5 min or isometric handgrip. The pressor response to cold was not changed and the response to the Valsalva manoeuvre was unaltered. These results suggest that the absence of tachycardia after perindopril may be in part related, as has been reported with other converting enzyme inhibitors, to enhanced cardiac parasympathetic tone. Vagomimetic action may be a property of converting enzyme inhibitors in general.
We noted five cases of reversible acute deterioration of renal function in patients with very mild to moderate renal insufficiency who received indomethacin for an acute gouty attack. This decrease in renal function was consistent with a primary decrease in renal blood flow. In addition, hyperkalemia developed in the patients, which we attribute to a decrease in renin and aldosterone secretion, a decrease in distal tubular delivery of sodium, and, more importantly, to a decrease in urine flow. This report is intended to alert physicians to the possible complications of indomethacin therapy in patients with mild renal insufficiency.
Cimetidine and theophylline were given together to a 67 year old chronic bronchitic post-operatively: the patient became very confused, shook of all his limbs, vomited, and presented a tachycardia. The greater than normal blood levels of theophylline (27.8 mg . 1(-1) confirmed its involvement in this clinical state. But, as there was no real overdose, the simultaneous administration of cimetidine was probably responsible for inducing this state. Three days after stopping this treatment, the disorder had completely disappeared.
Mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear lamina proteins lamin A and lamin C, are the most common cause of familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Mechanical stress-induced apoptosis has been proposed as the mechanism underpinning DCM in lamin A/C-deficient hearts, but supporting in vivo evidence has been lacking.
Our aim was to study interventions to modify mechanical stress in heterozygous Lmna knockout (Lmna(+/-)) mice.
Cardiac structure and function were evaluated before and after exercise training, thoracic aortic constriction, and carvedilol treatment. Lmna(+/-) mice develop adult-onset DCM with relatively more severe disease in males. Lmna(+/-) cardiomyocytes show altered nuclear morphology and perinuclear desmin organization, with enhanced responses to hypo-osmotic stress indicative of cytoskeletal instability. Despite these structural defects that provide a template for mechanical stress-induced damage, young Lmna(+/-) mice subjected to 6 weeks of moderate or strenuous exercise training did not show induction of apoptosis or accelerated DCM. In contrast, regular moderate exercise attenuated DCM development in male Lmna(+/-) mice. Sustained pressure overload generated by thoracic aortic constriction depressed ventricular contraction in young wild-type and Lmna(+/-) mice with no sex or genotype differences in the time-course or severity of response. Treatment of male Lmna(+/-) mice from 12 to 40 weeks with the beta-blocker, carvedilol, prevented the dilatation and contractile dysfunction that was observed in placebo-treated mice.
These data suggest that factors other than mechanical stress-induced apoptosis contribute to DCM and provide the first demonstration that regular moderate exercise and carvedilol can modify disease progression in lamin A/C-deficient hearts.
