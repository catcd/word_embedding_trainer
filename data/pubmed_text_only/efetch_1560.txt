CysLT(1) antagonists are effective for a subset of patients with asthma; however, there has been no good way to predict a given patient's response. We examined the interaction between the clinical response to a cysLT(1) antagonist, pranlukast, and DNA sequence variant A(-444)C in leukotriene C(4) synthase (LTC(4) S) gene in Japanese patients with moderate asthma. The frequency of LTC(4) S C(-444) allele was 21.6% in the Japanese general population (n = 171) and 19.4% in the asthmatic subjects ( n= 349). A 4-week prospective, open trial of pranlukast (225 mg twice daily) was performed in 50 patients with moderate asthma who had been well controlled with inhaled corticosteroid (beclomethasone 400-800 microg/day or fluticasone 200-400 microg/day). The C(-444) allele carriers (n = 16) responded better to pranlukast compared to the A(-444) allele homozygotes ( n= 31) [14.3 5.3% vs. 3.1 2.4% improvement of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1) ), 0.01], while LTC(4) S genotype-stratified response to inhaled beta-agonist salbutamol (200 microg) was not observed (17.5 2.1% vs. 18.7 2.2% improvement of FEV(1) ). Univariate analysis demonstrated that the better response to pranlukast (more than 10% improvement of FEV(1) ) was correlated with LTC(4) S genotype (P < 0.01) and pretreatment airway reversibility to salbutamol (P < 0.01), but not with sex, age, atopic status, urinary leukotriene E(4) excretion rate, or daily dose of inhaled corticosteroid. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis suggested that LTC(4) S genotype and the bronchodilatory effect of salbutamol were independent variables to predict the clinical response to pranlukast (P < 0.05). We conclude that LTC(4) S genotype is predictive of the clinical response to a cysLT(1) antagonist, pranlukast, in Japanese patients with moderate asthma.
Bicuculline methiodide (BMI), a gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) antagonist, is a powerful convulsant agent when injected into the cerebral ventricles, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, neocortex, and deep prepiriform cortex in rats. In contrast, bilateral microinjection of BMI into the rat striatum confers protection against seizures induced by the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (380 mg/kg, i.p.), with an ED50 of 94 fmol (range 45-195 fmol). No topographical variation in the anticonvulsant action of BMI was detected throughout rostrocaudal and dorsoventral aspects of the striatum. The anticonvulsant action of BMI in the striatum was reversed by coadministration of the GABA agonist muscimol or by blocking GABA-mediated inhibition in either the substantia nigra pars reticulata or in the entopeduncular nucleus. The results show that blockade of GABA-mediated inhibition in the striatum has a powerful anticonvulsant effect in the pilocarpine model, suggesting that GABAergic transmission in the striatum modulates the seizure propagation in the forebrain.
Patients who have chest pain following the use of cocaine have become more common in emergency departments throughout the United States,with approximately 6% of these patients sustaining an acute MI. The authors have described the rationale for recommending aspirin, benzodiaze-pines, and nitroglycerin as first-line treatments and calcium-channel blockade or phentolamine as possible second-line therapies and have summarized the controversies surrounding the use of fibrinolytic agents. Admission for observation is one reasonable approach to the management of the low-risk cohort. Evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease is reasonable, particularly in patients who have acute MI. Patients who do not have infarction can undergo evaluation for possible coronary artery disease on an outpatient basis. Routine interventions for secondary prophylaxis as well as cocaine rehabilitation should be used in this patient population, because the long-term prognosis seems somewhat dependent upon the ability of the patient to discontinue cocaine use.
Perhexiline maleate is an amphiphilic molecule. Along with many other drugs it is responsible for experimental and, in some instances, clinical lipidoses. Sphingomyelinase deficiency has been evidenced in cell cultures incubated with perhexiline maleate. We describe the occurrence of a similar defect in a patient. The disturbances in the phospholipid turnover which are responsible for the thesaurismosis may originate in the sphingomyelinase deficiency.
Nitric oxide (NO) is a tonically produced vasodilator that maintains blood pressure (BP) in the normal animal. In these studies, we produced chronic NO blockade by oral administration of the NO synthesis inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), which produced sustained hypertension and increased renal vascular resistance (RVR) in conscious rats. Acute blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor with losartan had little effect on BP and RVR in either chronically NO-blocked or normal conscious rats. Acute blockade of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor with prazosin produced moderate similar falls in BP in both chronically NO-blocked and normal rats. The combination of AT1 and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade was profoundly antihypertensive and was particularly effective in lowering BP in chronically NO-blocked rats where the hypertension was obliterated. In contrast, the increased RVR persisted in chronically NO-blocked rats receiving combined acute AT1 and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. These observations indicate that, in the sustained phase of chronic NO blockade, the hypertension is largely due to the combined activities of alpha 1-adrenoceptor and AT1 stimulation.
The long-term efficacy and potential side effects of oral sympathomimetic amines in the treatment of advanced congestive heart failure remain controversial. We studied the acute and chronic hemodynamic and arrhythmogenic effects of the beta-2 agonist, salbutamol, 6 mg by mouth four times/day, in 20 patients with NYHA classes III to IV congestive heart failure. Acutely, salbutamol increased the cardiac index (1.9 to 2.3 L/min/m2, p less than 0.01) and heart rate (92 to 97 bpm, p less than 0.01) while it decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (35 to 31 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Salbutamol increased the number of patients having episodes of ventricular tachycardia from two to six and increased the number of episodes of ventricular tachycardia from 2 to 27. Once salbutamol was discontinued, no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia occurred in these six patients. Six patients did not have long-term hemodynamic studies because of serious arrhythmias and two died. In the 12 patients who had long-term studies, the initial beneficial hemodynamic effects of salbutamol were maintained. Thus, although salbutamol may have beneficial long-term hemodynamic effects, it may cause serious arrhythmias in patients predisposed to develop arrhythmias.
This study describes the receptor-binding characteristics, antimuscarinic and antinicotinic activities of 2 beta-(2'-phenyl-2'-cyclopentyl-2'-hydroxy-ethoxy)tropane (beta-PCT) and its four optical isomers. Both arecoline-induced tremor and nicotine-induced convulsion in mice were antagonized by beta-PCT and its optical isomers. These compounds were less potent than atropine in their antimuscarinic potencies, but more potent than atropine in their antinicotinic activities. The isomer with the 1S-2 beta-2'R configuration was about one order of magnitude more potent than the isomer with the 1R-2 beta-2'S configuration in their antimuscarinic activity, but the antinicotinic potencies of these compounds did not differ significantly. The order of potencies of beta-PCT and its optical isomers to displace the specific binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to muscarinic receptors was similar to that of their antimuscarinic potencies. The binding of [3H]nicotine to central nicotinic receptors was not inhibited by these compounds. The findings indicate that beta-PCT and its optical isomers are useful affinity ligands to examine the biochemical and functional characteristics of brain cholinergic receptors.
Tiapride, a substituted benzamide derivative closely related to metoclopramide, reduced levodopa-induced peak dose involuntary movements in 16 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. However, an unacceptable increase in disability from Parkinsonism with aggravation of end-of-dose akinesia led to its cessation in 14 patients. Tiapride had no effect on levodopa-induced early morning of "off-period" segmental dystonia. These results fail to support the notion that levodopa-induced dyskinesias are caused by overstimulation of a separate group of dopamine receptors.
This study reports subjective experiences of nine anesthesiologists undergoing three consecutive epidural anesthetics.
Eight anesthesiologists and one nurse anesthetist, all ASA physical status 1, underwent three lumbar epidural anesthetics as part of another study. Epidural catheters were inserted via a 17-gauge Tuohy needle without sedation after local anesthesia with pH adjusted lidocaine at the second, third, or fourth lumbar interspace. Three local anesthetics (2% lidocaine HCl, 3% chloroprocaine HCl, and 0.75% bupivacaine HCl) were administered each separated by at least 48 hours. The local anesthetic was incrementally injected via the epidural catheter to achieve at least a T-1 dermatome level of analgesia. Each subject completed a written questionnaire at the end of the study regarding their experience.
Most of the subjects (7 of 9) had no prior epidural anesthesia. Eight of nine subjects experienced at least one paresthesia during catheter insertion; this was uniformly described as a "poorly localized burning sensation," radiating to the hip or leg. All subjects reported difficulty taking a deep breath and coughing with a T-1 level of analgesia. Eight of nine subjects reported dysphoria during lidocaine epidural anesthesia. Eight of nine subjects reported moderate back pain after dissipation of chloroprocaine epidural anesthesia.
All volunteers stated that they would change their anesthetic practice as a result of participation in this study. They believed that having experienced an epidural anesthetic made them better qualified to prepare patients for this anesthetic technique.
Treatment of mice with griseofulvin for 8 months induced hepatocellular nodules in the liver which persist after discontinuation of griseofulvin feeding. We investigated the porphyrogenic effect of griseofulvin on these nodules and surrounding nonneoplastic liver after renewed short-term exposure of tumor-bearing mice to this agent. Griseofulvin treatment for 4 days led to marked elevation of the activity of 5-aminolevulinate synthase in peritumoral (3.8-fold) and control (6-fold) liver. The increase in enzyme activity was much less pronounced in the nodules (1.5-fold). Ferrochelatase activity was markedly decreased under the same experimental conditions in both peritumoral and control livers (to 18 and 13.5%, respectively, of the pretreatment values), but the effect was considerably smaller in nodules (to 40% of the pretreatment value). These results may explain the lack of porphyrin accumulation in tumor tissue.
Lithium is used with great success in the treatment of manic patients and for prophylaxis of bipolar disorders. There are only few reports about neuropsychiatric side effects at therapeutic serum levels. We report on a 38 year old woman with bipolar disorder who was treated with lithium for 20 years without side-effects. Subsequent to a manic episode, she became disoriented at night and showed marked memory deficits. The patient did not show any neurological or gastrointestinal signs of intoxication. Lithium serum-levels were in therapeutic range. The psychiatric symptoms disappeared when lithium was stopped. We interpret these symptoms as delirant syndrome with pseudo-dementia at therapeutic lithium serum levels. This side-effect must be taken into account even in patients on successful longtime lithium therapy.
High-dose thiotepa has been successfully included in a variety of conditioning regimens for stem cell transplantation in hematological and solid neoplasms. Toxicity of high-dose thiotepa mainly manifests as profound myeloablation and some degree of liver damage. We report a case of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in a patient with primary CNS lymphoma who underwent therapy with high-dose thiotepa.
Tamoxifen therapy is reported to increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). To the authors' knowledge, it is not yet known whether the risk changes with the amount of time elapsed since the initial tamoxifen prescription. This information would be valuable in identifying patients at high risk for DVT/PE.
The relation between timing of tamoxifen use and venous thromboembolism risk was examined. The study population of 16,289 women was identified from the clinical database of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group. It included women diagnosed with International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stage I or stage II estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer between 1990 and 2004 at ages 45 to 69 years. Risks, risk ratios (RRs), and crude and adjusted hazards ratios were calculated for each of the first 5 years after breast cancer surgery and then cumulatively over the next 5 years.
The 5-year risk of DVT/PE was 1.2% for women receiving tamoxifen and 0.50% for women not receiving tamoxifen. Women treated with tamoxifen were at a higher risk for DVT/PE during the first 2 years after exposure (RR, 3.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.1-6.0). Subsequently, their risk was not found to be substantially increased (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.88-2.5). Older women taking tamoxifen appeared to be at higher risk than younger women during the first 2 years of exposure.
The findings of the current study suggest that the first 2 years after the initiation of tamoxifen therapy may be the most crucial time for monitoring DVT/PE risk, particularly in older women.
1,3 Butadiene (BD), isoprene (IP) and chloroprene (CP) are structural analogs. There were significantly increased incidences of forestomach neoplasms in B6C3F1 mice exposed to BD, IP or CP by inhalation for up to 2-years. The present study was designed to characterize genetic alterations in K- and H-ras proto-oncogenes in a total of 52 spontaneous and chemically induced forestomach neoplasms. ras mutations were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis, and cycle sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded forestomach neoplasms. A higher frequency of K- and H-ras mutations was identified in BD-, IP- and CP-induced forestomach neoplasms (83, 70 and 57%, respectively, or combined 31/41, 76%) when compared to spontaneous forestomach neoplasms (4/11, 36%). Also a high frequency of H-ras codon 61 CAA-->CTA transversions (10/41, 24%) was detected in chemically induced forestomach neoplasms, but none were present in the spontaneous forestomach neoplasms examined. Furthermore, an increased frequency (treated 13/41, 32% versus untreated 1/11, 9%) of GGC-->CGC transversion at K-ras codon 13 was seen in BD-, and IP-induced forestomach neoplasms, similar to the predominant K-ras mutation pattern observed in BD-induced mouse lung neoplasms. These data suggest that the epoxide intermediates of the structurally related chemicals (BD, IP, and CP) may cause DNA damage in K-ras and H-ras proto-oncogenes of B6C3F1 mice following inhalation exposure and that mutational activation of these genes may be critical events in the pathogenesis of forestomach neoplasms induced in the B6C3F1 mouse.
The control of IL-10 production and mechanisms that mediate synergy between IFN-gamma and TLR ligands are not well understood. We report that IFN-gamma augments induction of TNFalpha by TLR ligands, immune complexes, and zymosan by suppressing IL-10 production and thereby interrupting Stat3-mediated feedback inhibition. IFN-gamma altered TLR2-induced signal transduction by increasing GSK3 activity and suppressing MAPK activation, leading to diminished IL-10 production. Inhibition of GSK3 or ablation of the GSK3beta gene ameliorated TLR2-induced peritonitis and arthritis. IFN-gamma suppressed the activity of CREB and AP-1, transcription factors that induce IL-10 expression and are regulated in part by MAPKs and GSK3. These results yield insight into mechanisms by which IFN-gamma regulates IL-10 production and TLR2-mediated inflammatory responses and identify inhibition of CREB and AP-1 as part of the macrophage response to IFN-gamma. GSK3 and CREB/AP-1 are key players in integrating IFN-gamma and TLR2 responses in innate immunity and inflammation.
To investigate the effects of naloxone and morphine during acute hypoxia.
Prospective, randomized animal study.
University laboratory.
Twenty-eight adult male Sprague Dawley rats, weighing 300-350 g.
The rats were implanted with a femoral catheter and subcutaneous electrodes for electrocardiogram recording and were randomly assigned to receive morphine (5 mg/kg), naloxone (5 mg and 10 mg/kg), or normal saline (control) (n = 7 in each). Fifteen minutes after intraperitoneal injection of the drug, each rat was exposed to hypoxic gas (5% oxygen, 95% N2) for 70 mins. Hypoxic survival time was measured. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial pH, Paco2, Pao2, and base excess were measured before injection (baseline), 14 mins after injection (H0), and 6 mins (H1), 33 mins (H2), and 48 mins (H3) after exposure to hypoxia.
Hypoxic survival was similar between the naloxone 5 mg/kg and control groups (p = .183), significantly lower in the naloxone 10 mg/kg group (p < .01), and significantly higher in the morphine 5 mg/kg group (p < .05) compared with controls. MAP significantly decreased in all groups. However, at H2-H3, MAP was better preserved in both naloxone groups and was lower in the morphine group compared with controls. Paco2 was maintained higher at H0-H3 in the morphine group and lower at H2-H3 in both naloxone groups compared with controls.
During acute hypoxia, naloxone preserves arterial blood pressure and attenuates hypoxic ventilatory depression by antagonizing endogenous opiates, but it does not improve hypoxic survival. In contrast, morphine, which enhances the action of endogenous opiates, does improve hypoxic survival. The acute hypoxic tolerance of morphine may be partly attributable to a depression of oxygen consumption, increased cerebral blood flow secondary to high Paco2, and protective actions mediated by delta-opioid receptors.
To investigate the prolonged effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade on intrarenal hemodynamics, whole kidney and renal micropuncture studies were performed in male 21-wk-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats treated for 3 wk with quinapril (3 mg/kg), terazosin (1 mg/kg), or in their combination (quinapril 1.5 mg/kg and terazosin 0.5 mg/kg). In WKY, only quinapril significantly reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) associated with reduced afferent arteriolar resistance; there were no other significant changes. In contrast, all treatments similarly decreased MAP in SHR. Quinapril increased renal plasma flow and decreased filtration fraction. With respect to intrarenal hemodynamics, quinapril increased single-nephron plasma flow and reduced glomerular capillary pressure (from 53.1 to 47.8 mmHg; P < 0.01), associated with reduced afferent (from 4.80 to 3.17 10(10)dyn.s.cm-5; P < 0.01) and efferent (from 1.70 to 1.17 10(10)dyn.s.cm-5; P < 0.01) arteriolar resistances, and increased ultrafiltration coefficient (from 0.037 to 0.052 nl.s-1.mmHg-1; P < 0.05). Terazosin only reduced arteriolar resistance. The combined treatment attenuated either agent's independent effects on glomerular hemodynamics. These data demonstrate that prolonged ACE and adrenergic inhibition therapy alone or in combination produce different effects than when given by vein, suggesting that prolonged renopressor system inhibition may be more effective than adrenergic in SHR.
Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation. However, adverse effects include cardiac toxicity. Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation. The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy. Thus, we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy. In patients receiving tacrolimus therapy, blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement.
Estrogen plays a critical role in breast cancer. Thereafter, endocrine therapy is a standard of care in patients with breast carcinoma, expressing ER or PR.
Herein we report the case of a 53-year old patient, who developed cholestasis and vasculitis during the treatment with tamoxifen. This toxicity was reversable after the removal of the drug. Thereafter she continued adjuvant treatment for breast carcinoma with anastrazole. Since tamoxifen has been widely indicated for patients with breast carcinoma, we did a literature review, looking for other cases with this type of toxicity.
This case is the third with vasculitis informed in the literature, but the first one that additionally developed cholestasis and arthritis. Although it is rare, we discuss the indication of this drug in the actual era, where aromatase inhibitors offer a better security profile.
To compare ioxaglate and iobitridol for percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) as regards thromboembolic complications, the quality of diagnosis, and renal and general safety.
One hundred and eighty-nine patients were prospectively studied, 98 of whom received ioxaglate, and 91, iobitridol. Twenty-two were secondarily excluded from the evaluation of thromboembolic complications as they did not undergo PTRA.
Two hundred and two PTRAs were performed. The total volumes of contrast medium administered and the procedure durations were the same for each patient. In the ioxaglate group, four dissections (3 stents), one occlusive dissection, and two spasms occurred; in the iobitridol group, there were three dissections (all stented), one occlusive dissection (stented), and two spasms. The final angiograms showed four renal infarctions with ioxaglate (2 of which were in patients who were not anticoagulated), two with iobitridol. No significant difference was seen in the incidence of thromboembolic complications when the PTRA was performed after anticoagulation (n = 150; 3.9% vs 4%, p = 0.78); in the whole population, thromboembolic complications were more frequent in the ioxaglate group but the difference was not significant (5.7% vs 3.7%, p = 0.74). The quality of the diagnosis and the general and renal safety were the same in the two groups.
Regarding the clotting phenomenon, we recorded as many thromboembolic complications with ioxaglate as with iobitridol.
Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a FDA-approved multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR/ABL and Src kinases. It is now used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapies, including imatinib. Here we report a novel effect of dasatinib on inducing the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through MEK/ERK-dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). We found that dasatinib could induce the differentiation of AML cells as demonstrated by the expression of differentiation marker CD11b, G0/G1 phase arrest and decreased ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. Of note, dasatinib induced robust phosphorylation of STAT1 both at Tyr701 and Ser727 as well as the redistribution of STAT1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thus leading to the transcription of STAT1-targeted genes. Knocking down STAT1 expression by shRNA significantly attenuated dasatinib-induced differentiation, indicating an important role of STAT1 in myeloid maturation. We further found that dasatinib-induced activation of STAT1 was regulated by the MEK/ERK kinases. The phosporylation of MEK and ERK occurred rapidly upon dasatinib treatment and increased progressively as differentiation was induced. MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0216 not only inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1, but also abrogated dasatinib-induced myeloid differentiation, suggesting that MEK/ERK dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 might be indispensable for the differentiating effect of dasatinib in AML cells. Taken together, our study suggests that STAT1 is an important mediator in dasatinib-induced differentiation of AML cells, whose activation requires the activation of MEK/ERK cascades.
The aim of this study was to compare the renal tolerance of cisplatin and carboplatin in euvolemic and dehydrated rats. A total of 79 euvolemic or dehydrated male rats were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin (5 mg/kg body weight, i.p.), carboplatin (40 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) or vehicle. Body weight, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, fractional excretion of sodium and urinary NAG excretion were recorded on days 1 and 5. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and renal histology were determined on day 5. In the euvolemic and dehydrated control and carboplatin groups we observed no change in serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, GFR and ERPF. In the euvolemic and dehydrated control groups we observed no change in urinary NAG excretion. Carboplatin induced a slight but significant increase in urinary NAG excretion. In dehydrated rats carboplatin induced a significantly higher increase in urinary NAG excretion than in euvolemic rats. Cisplatin induced a marked and significant decrease in GFR and ERPF, and a significant increase in NAG. Dehydration markedly potentiated cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Euvolemic rats treated with cisplatin exhibited slight renal lesions with a mean score which was similar to the control group. The most extensive lesions were observed in euvolemic and dehydrated cisplatin treated rats with tubular necrosis in the outer stripe of the medulla.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Epidural anesthesia is practiced in virtually every clinical setting. Its safety and versatility have supported increasing use for more and varied therapies. In a healthy patient in whom near-complete left hemiparesis developed following a routine continuous epidural anesthetic for labor, subdural deposit of the local anesthetic was suspected. The following case and discussion may help illustrate the mechanism behind this complication and how it can be detected, treated, and, possibly, avoided.
