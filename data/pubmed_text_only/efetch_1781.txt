Steroid therapy has been widely used in neonates for its beneficial effects. Adverse side-effects have been described, also affecting the cardiovascular system. We report two cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in two preterm newborns secondary to dexamethasone treatment. Full recovery occurred after discontinuing steroids. Risk/benefit ratios must be carefully considered before using steroids in the neonatal period.
Serial echocardiographic evaluations should be performed to evaluate prevalence and clinical relevance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in preterm infants treated with dexamethasone.
Public health agencies utilize aerial insecticides to interrupt an active West Nile virus (WNV) transmission cycle, which may expose WNV-infected birds to these agents. Although resmethrin has been considered benign to birds, no studies have evaluated whether the environmentally employed form of resmethrin with PBO synergist (synergized resmethrin (SR)) can suppress avian immunity to WNV infection and enhance a bird's host competence. Recognizing that wild birds confront toxicological stressors in the context of various physiological states, we exposed four groups (n=9-11) of 9-week-old chickens (Gallus domesticus) to drinking water with either SR (three alternate days at 50 microg/l resmethrin+150 microg/l piperonyl butoxide), CORT (10 days at 20mg/l to induce subacute stress), the combination of SR and CORT, or 0.10% ethanol vehicle coincident with WNV infection. Compared to controls, SR treatment did not magnify but extended viremia by 1 day, and depressed IgG; CORT treatment elevated (mean, 4.26 log(10)PFU/ml) and extended viremia by 2 days, enhanced IgM and IgG, and increased oral virus. The combination of SR and CORT increased the number of chickens that shed oral virus compared to those treated with CORT alone. None of the chickens developed a readily infectious viremia to mosquitoes (none >or=5 log(10)PFU/ml), but viremia in a CORT-exposed chicken was up to 4.95 log(10)PFU/ml. Given that SR is utilized during WNV outbreaks, continued work toward a complete risk assessment of the potential immunotoxic effects of SR is warranted. This would include parameterization of SR exposures with immunological consequences in wild birds using both replicating (in the laboratory) and non-replicating (in the field) antigens. As a start, this study indicates that SR can alter some immunological parameters, but with limited consequences to primary WNV infection outcome, and that elevated CORT mildly enhances SRs immunotoxicity in chickens.
In the etiology of premature labor prostaglandins fulfill a significant role. It is known that indomethacin is a strong inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. The effect of indomethacin on premature labor was studied in a prospective randomized double-blind study in 36 patients. Eighteen patients received indomethacin and eighteen received placebo. 200-300 mg of indomethacin was the total dosage in a 24 hours period. The activity of the uterus was monitored with a cardiotocograph. The mean duration of pregnancy and the mean birth weight in indomethacin group (36.4 weeks, 2833 g) were both significantly greater (p less than 0.001) than that in placebo group (31.2 weeks, 2028 g). In the indomethacin group 3 children weighted less than 2500 g compared with 14 in placebo group. In 15 of 18 indomethacin treated patients (83.3%) premature labor was arrested after indomethacin treatment compared with 4 of 18 in the placebo group (22.2%). The indomethacin group had a mean 1 minute APGAR score of 9.3 +/- 0.2 whereas the placebo group showed a score of 7.8 +/- 0.5 (p less than 0.01). Three infants died from respiratory distress syndrome; one in the indomethacin group (1810 g) and two in the placebo group (600 and 1450 g). Autopsies in the infants demonstrated a typical picture of pulmonary atelectasis and hyaline membranes. There was no evidence of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus or pulmonary hypertension. 2 mothers in the indomethacin group suffered minor discomfort i.e. nausea, vomiting and vertigo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Several low weight molecules have often been implicated in the induction of occupational asthma. Glyphosate, a small molecule herbicide, is widely used in the world. There is a controversy regarding a role of glyphosate in developing asthma and rhinitis among farmers, the mechanism of which is unexplored. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms of glyphosate induced pulmonary pathology by utilizing murine models and real environmental samples. C57BL/6, TLR4-/-, and IL-13-/- mice inhaled extracts of glyphosate-rich air samples collected on farms during spraying of herbicides or inhaled different doses of glyphosate and ovalbumin. The cellular response, humoral response, and lung function of exposed mice were evaluated. Exposure to glyphosate-rich air samples as well as glyphosate alone to the lungs increased: eosinophil and neutrophil counts, mast cell degranulation, and production of IL-33, TSLP, IL-13, and IL-5. In contrast, in vivo systemic IL-4 production was not increased. Co-administration of ovalbumin with glyphosate did not substantially change the inflammatory immune response. However, IL-13-deficiency resulted in diminished inflammatory response but did not have a significant effect on airway resistance upon methacholine challenge after 7 or 21 days of glyphosate exposure. Glyphosate-rich farm air samples as well as glyphosate alone were found to induce pulmonary IL-13-dependent inflammation and promote Th2 type cytokines, but not IL-4 for glyphosate alone. This study, for the first time, provides evidence for the mechanism of glyphosate-induced occupational lung disease.
Diffuse systemic sclerosis (DSS) is an autoimmune disease that is most often endogenous but which can also be induced by exogenous substances of occupational origin.
We report a case of DSS involving prolonged intermittent occupational exposure to solvents (trichloroethylene [TCE] and perchloroethylene [PCE]). The disease was rapidly fatal with cardiac arrest secondary to myocardial fibrosis.
In the event of exposure to TCE/PCE, we suggest more systematic prevention and diagnosis of DSS.
The WWOX gene encodes a tumor suppressor spanning the second most common human fragile site, FRA16D. Targeted deletion of the Wwox gene in mice led to an increased incidence of spontaneous and ethyl nitrosourea-induced tumors. In humans, loss of heterozygosity and reduced or loss of WWOX expression has been reported in esophageal squamous cell cancers (SCC). In the present study, we examined whether inactivation of the Wwox gene might lead to enhanced esophageal/forestomach tumorigenesis induced by N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine. Wwox+/- and Wwox+/+ mice were treated with six intragastric doses of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine and observed for 15 subsequent weeks. Ninety-six percent (25 of 26) of Wwox+/- mice versus 29% (10 of 34) of Wwox+/+ mice developed forestomach tumors (P = 1.3 x 10(-7)). The number of tumors per forestomach was significantly greater in Wwox+/- than in Wwox+/+ mice (3.2 +/- 0.34 versus 0.47 +/- 0.17; P < 0.0001). In addition, 27% of Wwox+/- mice had invasive SCC in the forestomach, as compared with 0% of wild-type controls (P = 0.002). Intriguingly, forestomachs from Wwox+/- mice displayed moderately strong Wwox protein staining in the near-normal epithelium, but weak and diffuse staining in SCC in the same tissue section, a result suggesting that Wwox was haploinsufficient for the initiation of tumor development. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence of the tumor suppressor function of WWOX in forestomach/esophageal carcinogenesis and suggest that inactivation of one allele of WWOX accelerates the predisposition of normal cells to malignant transformation.
A number of studies have shown that various vitamins K, specifically vitamin K2, possessed antitumor activity on various types of rodent- and human-derived neoplastic cell lines. However, there are only a small number of reports demonstrating in vivo antitumor effects of vitamins K. Furthermore, the mechanism of antitumor effects of vitamins K still remains to be examined. In the present study, we examined the antitumor effects of vitamins K2, K3 and K5 on PLC/PRF/5 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vivo. Furthermore, to examine the mechanism of antitumor actions of these vitamins K, mRNA expression levels of various G1 phase-related cell cycle molecules were evaluated by using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. HCC-bearing animals were produced by implanting PLC/PRF/5 cells subcutaneously into athymic nude mice, and drinking water containing vitamin K2, K3 or K5 was given to the animals. Treatments with vitamins K2, K3 and K5 were shown to markedly inhibit the growth of HCC tumors. To examine the mechanism of in vivo antitumor effects of vitamins K, total RNA was extracted from HCC tumors, and the expression of G1 phase-related cell cycle molecules was quantitatively examined. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of the cell cycle-driving molecule, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), in HCC was significantly reduced by the treatments with vitamin K2, K3 and K5. Conversely, the expression of the cell cycle-suppressing molecules, Cdk inhibitor p16INK4a and retinoblastoma, in HCC was significantly enhanced by the treatments with vitamins K2, K3 and K5. These results indicate that vitamins K2, K3 and K5 exert antitumor effects on HCC by regulating the expression of G1 phase-related cell cycle molecules. These results also indicate that vitamins K2, K3 and K5 may be useful agents for the treatment of patients with HCC.
The synthetic steroid 7alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT) is a potent androgen that is resistant to 5alpha-reductase. It thus has decreased activity at the prostate and may have advantages over testosterone-based regimens in long term treatment or as part of a male contraceptive. Administration to eugonadal men results in suppression of gonadotropins, but its ability to support androgen-dependent behavior has not been investigated. For sustained release administration, MENT acetate was used, because its diffusion characteristics were more suitable for use in implants. However, upon release the acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed, and MENT is the biologically active moiety in circulation. We studied the effects of MENT on sexual interest and activity, spontaneous erection, and mood states in comparison with testosterone enanthate (TE) in 20 Caucasian and Chinese hypogonadal men recruited in Edinburgh and Hong Kong (n = 10 in each center). Outcomes were measured using a combination of daily diaries, semistructured interviews, and questionnaires. Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) was also recorded in the Edinburgh group. After withdrawal of androgen replacement treatment (wash-out phase) for a minimum of 6 weeks, subjects were randomized to two groups in a cross-over design. Drug treatment regimens were of 6-week duration and consisted of two implants, each containing 115 mg MENT acetate, inserted s.c. into the upper arm and removed after 6 weeks and two injections of TE (200 mg, i.m.) 3 weeks apart. MENT treatment resulted in stable plasma MENT concentrations of 1.4 +/- 0.1 nmol/L after 3 weeks and 1.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/L after 6 weeks (mean +/- SEM; all men). Nadir testosterone concentrations were 3.6 +/- 0.6 nmol/L at the end of the wash-out phase and 9.4 +/- 0.6 nmol/L 3 weeks after each injection. There were no differences in hormone concentrations between centers. There were no adverse toxicological effects. There were only minor differences between the two treatments. Both MENT and TE treatment resulted in significant increases in sexual interest and activity, spontaneous erection (both by self-report and NPT measurement), and increases in positive moods, with decreases in negative moods in the Edinburgh group. In the Hong Kong group, both treatments increased waking erection, with a trend toward increased sexual interest and activity. Mood states appeared to be less affected during the wash-out phase than in Edinburgh men and showed no significant response to either treatment. These results demonstrate that MENT has similar effects on sexual activity and mood states as testosterone in hypogonadal men. As NPT is a physiological androgen-dependant outcome, these data provide further evidence for the androgenicity of MENT. The lack of detected effect of either androgen in Hong Kong men other than on waking erection illustrates the importance of the cultural context of symptomatology and its measurement. The appropriate dose of MENT remains to be determined, but these results support its development as a potential androgen replacement therapy.
Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional protein that is found in milk, neutrophils, and other biological fluids. Under inflammatory conditions, LF production is increased in the periphery by neutrophils. However, the cardiovascular function of LF is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of bovine LF (BLF) on the mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) in urethane-anesthetized rats and the vascular function of BLF in the rat thoracic aorta. Intravenous injection of BLF produced dose-dependent decreases in MBP but did not affect HR, while the opioid agonist morphine decreased both MBP and HR. The hypotensive effect of BLF was not altered by naloxone methiodide, which cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier, but was significantly reduced by naloxone hydrochloride, which does pass through the blood-brain barrier. BLF-induced hypotension was completely blocked by the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) but not by the inactive enantiomer of l-NAME, NG-nitro-d-arginine methyl ester (d-NAME). BLF-induced hypotension was not altered by the muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist atropine or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac. BLF produced relaxation in endothelium-intact but not endothelium-denuded aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine. The relaxation evoked by BLF was completely blocked by l-NAME but not by d-NAME or the ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker glibenclamide. These results suggest that BLF causes hypotension via an endothelium-dependent vasodilation that is strongly mediated by NO production and that BLF-induced hypotension also may be mediated by the central opioidergic system.
Cardiac arrest in pregnancy is a rare event in which the speed of the response and attention to a number of pregnancy-specific interventions is crucial to the outcome. The commencement of a perimortem Caesarean delivery within 4 min of the onset of the arrest has been recommended as a technique to potentially improve survival in both the mother and the fetus but presents significant logistical challenges to the health-care facility. In this report, we describe two cases of cardiac arrest in pregnancy in which a perimortem Caesarean was performed as part of the resuscitation process and was associated with excellent maternal and neonatal outcomes. We discuss some of the issues surrounding the performance of a perimortem Caesarean delivery that were relevant to this case, including experience from the training that is provided in our institution.
Dual inhibitors of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been investigated for breast, lung, gastric, prostate, and other cancers; one, lapatinib, is currently approved for breast cancer. To develop novel HER2/EGFR dual kinase inhibitors, we designed and synthesized pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivatives capable of fitting into the receptors' ATP binding site. Among the prepared compounds, 34e showed potent HER2 and EGFR (HER1) inhibitory activities as well as tumor growth inhibitory activity. The X-ray cocrystal structures of 34e with both HER2 and EGFR demonstrated that 34e interacts with the expected residues in their respective ATP pockets. Furthermore, reflecting its good oral bioavailability, 34e exhibited potent in vivo efficacy in HER2-overexpressing tumor xenograft models. On the basis of these findings, we report 34e (TAK-285) as a promising candidate for clinical development as a novel HER2/EGFR dual kinase inhibitor.
A case of complete heart block occurred after induction of halothane anesthesia in a previously healthy child. The patient underwent repair of an umbilical hernia under general anesthesia. After a standard halothane, nitrous oxide, and oxygen mask induction, complete heart block was noted on the electrocardiographic monitor. Atropine and 100% oxygen were administered, and sinus tachycardia resulted. With the immediate stabilization of the patient's condition, the surgical team agreed to proceed with the case. After deepening of the level of anesthesia, first with halothane and then with desflurane and easy intubation of the trachea, complete heart block again was noted. Oxygen was administered at 100%, sinus tachycardia resumed, the case was canceled, and the patient emerged from anesthesia without further incident. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged to home.
To identify and compare clinical and neuroimaging predictors of primary lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) recurrence, assessing their relative contributions to recurrent ICH.
Subjects were consecutive survivors of primary ICH drawn from a single-center prospective cohort study. Baseline clinical, imaging, and laboratory data were collected. Survivors were followed prospectively for recurrent ICH and intercurrent aspirin and warfarin use, including duration of exposure. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify predictors of recurrence stratified by ICH location, with aspirin and warfarin exposures as time-dependent variables adjusting for potential confounders.
A total of 104 primary lobar ICH survivors were enrolled. Recurrence of lobar ICH was associated with previous ICH before index event (hazard ratio [HR] 7.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-15.7), number of lobar microbleeds (HR 2.93 with 2-4 microbleeds present, 95% CI 1.3-4.0; HR = 4.12 when >or=5 microbleeds present, 95% CI 1.6-9.3), and presence of CT-defined white matter hypodensity in the posterior region (HR 4.11, 95% CI 1.01-12.2). Although aspirin after ICH was not associated with lobar ICH recurrence in univariate analyses, in multivariate analyses adjusting for baseline clinical predictors, it independently increased the risk of ICH recurrence (HR 3.95, 95% CI 1.6-8.3, p = 0.021).
Recurrence of lobar ICH is associated with previous microbleeds or macrobleeds and posterior CT white matter hypodensity, which may be markers of severity for underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Use of an antiplatelet agent following lobar ICH may also increase recurrence risk.
We report a case of bladder leiomyosarcoma which occurred in a 22-year-old female who had been treated with cyclophosphamide for a period of 68 months for retinoblastoma diagnosed at 18 months postpartum. Partial cystectomy was performed. Forty-two months after the operation she is tumor-free.
We report on a patient who became jaundiced during treatment with clozapine (Leponex). Histologically, cholestatic hepatitis with single-cell necroses of hepatocytes and infiltration of the portal zones with eosinophilic granulocytes were found. The patient recovered after discontinuation of clozapine, and liver function tests returned to normal within 4 weeks. This adverse effect of clozapine suggests that this "atypical" tricyclic neuroleptic resembles the phenothiazines both with regard to therapeutic spectrum and side effects.
The effects of the optically active enantiomers of oxaprotiline (OXP), R(-) OXP and S(+) OXP, on depressive symptomatology and the sleep EEG were investigated in two separate exploratory studies. In addition, the neuroendocrine profile of both compounds was characterized in normal controls. In the patients treated with a daily oral dose of 150 mg S(+) OXP we found a Hamilton depression score that decreased from 29.1 +/- 1.8 (SEM) on day 0 to 14.7 +/- 3.2 on day 28 (P < 0.01). Six patients were judged to be full responders (HAMD score 0-7 points), three were improved (HAMD score 8-15) and four were nonresponders (HAMD score > 16). The therapeutic effect achieved with 150 mg R(-) OXP daily was less pronounced: the HAMD score decreased from 27.8 +/- 2.5 on day 0 to 19.4 +/- 3.2 on day 28 (P < 0.05). There were two full responders, one improved patient and seven nonresponders. The sleep EEG scoring revealed a marked suppression of REM sleep among patients treated with S(+) OXP but not with R(-) OXP. In the normal controls, a single oral dose of 75 mg S(+) OXP prompted an increase in the secretion of cortisol and growth hormone, whereas 75 mg R(-) OXP did not. Neither enantiomer influenced the secretion of testosterone or prolactin.
The clinical records of ten premature infants with nephrolithiasis were reviewed. The probable mechanism of stone formation was hypercalciuria due to furosemide therapy (nine patients) and congenital hyperparathyroidism (one patient). The relatively high rates of urinary excretion of calcium from immature kidneys predisposed these neonates to the development of calcium stones. Renal calculi in neonates are complications of distinct, treatable conditions, and premature babies receiving furosemide treatment should be screened by ultrasonography for renal calcifications.
Melatonin has blocked adventitious movements induced by L-dopa in intact mice. It has reversed the adventitious turning to the right, and it has induced running to the left in mice receiving L-dopa after a lesion in the right caudate nucleus.
This study examined the inhibitory effect of topical cyclosporine (CsA) treatment on conjunctiva epithelial apoptosis in a murine model of xerophthalamia. Dry eye was induced in 3 groups of C57BL6 mice by subcutaneous injection of scopolamine (t.i.d) and exposure to an air draft and low-humidity environment for 16 h each day for 12 days. The dry eye control group received no topical treatment; another group received 1 microL of 0.05% CsA topically (t.i.d, dry eye+CsA); and the third group received 1 microL of the castor oil vehicle of CsA topically (t.i.d, dry eye + vehicle). Normal mice were used as untreated controls. Twelve days later, the mice were killed, and their conjunctivas were excised. The number of the conjunctival goblet cells was counted in tissue sections stained with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) reagent. Their conjunctiva epithelium had been investigated by immuno-histochemical staining to detect the goblet cells and the expression of Caspase-3, Bax and bcl-2. Our results showed that compared with dry eye control and dry eye mice + vehicle groups, the number of conjunctival epithelial goblet cells was significantly greater in the untreated controls and dry eye mice receiving CsA (P < 0.01 for both groups). There was no significant difference in the number of conjunctival epithelial goblet cells between the dry eye control and dry eye+vehicle group. It was also true of the number of conjunctival epithelial goblet cells when comparison was made between the normal group and the dry eye+CsA group. Expressions of Caspas-3 and Bax were increased and ex-pression of bcl-2 was decreased in conjunctival epithelial cells in dry eye control and dry eye mice+vehicle groups. There was a significant positive correlation between goblet cell number and the number of cells that expressed bcl-2, and a negative correlation between goblet cells and Caspase-3 and Bax expression. It is concluded that the topical use of CsA could significantly reduce conjunctival epithelial apoptosis and protect goblet cell against the loss in experimental murine xerophathalamia. Inhibition of apoptosis appears to be a key mechanism responsible for the therapeutic effect of CsA on xerophthalamia.
Schizophrenia may be associated with increased prostaglandin synthesis in certain parts of the brain. This hypothesis is based on the following findings: (1) Catalepsy, which is the nearest equivalent in animals to human catatonia, develops in cats when prostaglandin E1 is injected into the cerebral ventricles and when during endotoxin or lipid A fever the prostaglandin E2 level in cisternal c.s.f. rises to high levels; however, when fever and prostaglandin level are brought down by non-steroid anti-pyretics which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, catalepsy disappears as well. (2) Febrile episodes are a genuine syndrome of schizophrenia.
Hydro-ethanolic extract (70%) of Calotropis procera flowers was prepared and tested for its hepatoprotective effect against paracetamol-induced hepatitis in rats. Alteration in the levels of biochemical markers of hepatic damage like SGPT, SGOT, ALP, bilirubin, cholesterol, HDL and tissue GSH were tested in both treated and untreated groups. Paracetamol (2 g/kg) has enhanced the SGPT, SGOT, ALP, bilirubin and cholesterol levels and reduced the serum levels of HDL and tissue level of GSH. Treatment with hydro-ethanolic extract of C. procera flowers (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) has brought back the altered levels of biochemical markers to the near normal levels in the dose dependent manner.
This is the first report of dexamethasone-induced left ventricular outflow obstruction causing decreased coronary artery perfusion and apical transmural cardiac infarct that resulted in hemopericardium and rapid cardiac tamponade. The differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion must now include dexamethasone-induced hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) mutations are the most frequent mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) that confer a poor prognosis. Constitutively active FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) mutations define a promising target for therapeutic approaches using small molecule inhibitors. However, several point mutations of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) have been identified to mediate resistance towards FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FLT3-TKI), including secondary mutations of FLT3. We investigated the cellular effects of the recently characterised FLT3-TKI ponatinib (AP24534) on murine myeloid cells transfected with FLT3-ITD with or without additional point mutations of the FLT3-TKD including the (so far) multi-resistant F691I mutation. Ponatinib effectively induced apoptosis not only in the parental FLT3-ITD cell line but also in all stably transfected subclones harbouring additional FLT3-TKD point mutations (N676D, F691I or G697R). These observations correlated with a strong inhibition of FLT3-ITD and its downstream targets STAT5, AKT and ERK1/2 upon ponatinib incubation, as determined by Western blotting. We conclude that ponatinib represents a promising FLT3-TKI that should be further investigated in clinical trials. The targeted therapy of FLT3-ITD-positive AML with ponatinib might be associated with a lower frequency of secondary resistance caused by acquired FLT3-TKD mutations.
Hypertension is associated with inward remodeling of small arteries and decreased erythrocyte deformability, both impairing proper tissue perfusion. We hypothesized that these alterations depend on transglutaminases, cross-linking enzymes present in the vascular wall, monocytes/macrophages and erythrocytes.
Wild-type (WT) mice and tissue-type transglutaminase (tTG) knockout (KO) mice received the nitric oxide inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) to induce hypertension. After 1 week, mesenteric arteries from hypertensive WT mice showed a smaller lumen diameter (-6.9 +/- 2.0%, p = 0.024) and a larger wall-to-lumen ratio (11.8 +/- 3.5%, p = 0.012) than controls, whereas inward remodeling was absent in hypertensive tTG KO mice. After 3 weeks, the wall-to-lumen ratio was increased in WT (20.8 +/- 4.8%, p = 0.005) but less so in tTG KO mice (11.7 +/- 4.6%, p = 0.026), and wall stress was normalized in WT but not in tTG KO mice. L-NAME did not influence expression of tTG or an alternative transglutaminase, coagulation factor XIII (FXIII). Suppression of FXIII by macrophage depletion was associated with increased tTG in the presence of L-NAME. L-NAME treatment decreased erythrocyte deformability in the WT mice (-15.3% at 30 dynes/cm(2), p = 0.014) but not in the tTG KO mice.
Transglutaminases are involved in small artery inward remodeling and erythrocyte stiffening associated with nitric oxide inhibition-related hypertension.
To determine the effects of a [6]-gingerol analogue (6G), a major chemical component of the ginger rhizome, and its stable analogue after digestion in simulated gastric fluid, aza-[6]-gingerol (A6G), on diet-induced body fat accumulation, we synthesized 6G and A6G. Mice were fed either a control regular rodent chow, a high-fat diet (HFD), or a HFD supplemented with 6G and A6G. Magnetic resonance imaging adiposity parameters of the 6G- and A6G-treated mice were compared with those of control mice. Supplementation with 6G and A6G significantly reduced body weight gain, fat accumulation, and circulating levels of insulin and leptin. The mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 in the liver were significantly lower in mice fed A6G than in HFD control mice. Our findings indicate that A6G, rather than 6G, enhances energy metabolism and reduces the extent of lipogenesis by downregulating SREBP-1c and its related molecules, which leads to the suppression of body fat accumulation.
Thirty dogs undergoing pelvic or hindlimb orthopedic surgery were each administered one of the following postoperative treatments: intramuscular oxymorphone 0.15 mg/kg (OIM) (n = 10); epidural oxymorphone 0.05 mg/kg, (OEP) (n = 10); or epidural medetomidine, 0.015 mg/kg (MEP) (n = 10). Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and arterial blood pressure were measured before drug injection and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, and 480 minutes postinjection (PI). Arterial blood gas analysis was performed before and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 360, and 480 minutes PI. The duration of analgesia with OEP, 7.62 + 0.30 hours (mean +/- SEM), and MEP, 7.06 + 0.50 hours, was significantly (P < .05) longer than the 4.91 + 0.44 hours obtained with OIM. All treatments resulted in a significant decrease in HR. Four dogs receiving epidural medetomidine each had second degree atrioventricular (AV) block associated with sinus arrhythmia for a brief period during the first 20 minutes after injection. There was no significant difference in arterial blood pressure between OIM and OEP but arterial blood pressure was significantly higher with MEP than with OIM. MEP can provide analgesia comparable with OEP, but bradycardia and second degree AV block will develop in some cases.
