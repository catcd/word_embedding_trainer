Six depressed patients were treated routinely with desipramine, a relatively selective noradrenergic uptake blocking drug. After 0, 1 and 3 weeks' treatment, pupillary responses to tyramine, phenylephrine and pilocarpine were measured using a photographic techniques. Both 1 and 3 weeks' treatment significantly inhibited tyramine and phenylephrine-induced mydriasis, but did not inhibit pilocarpine-induced miosis; in fact the longer treatment enhanced miosis due to pilocarpine. Resting pupil size was significantly increased after 1 and 3 weeks' treatment. The findings can be explained by the known ability of desipramine to block noradrenaline uptake and alpha adrenoceptors: they provide no evidence of muscarinic receptor blockade or of a slowly developing adaptation at alpha adrenoceptors.
The objective of this prospective double-blind study was to determine whether postoperative residual paralysis (PORP) after pancuronium or vecuronium results in hypoxemia and hypercapnia in the immediate admission period to the recovery ward. Eighty-three consecutive surgical patients received balanced or intravenous anesthesia with pancuronium for operations lasting longer than one hour or vecuronium for those lasting less than 60 min, both combined with neostigmine at the end of anesthesia. Standard clinical criteria assessed neuromuscular function intraoperatively. Postoperatively, we determined neuromuscular function (acceleromyography with supramaximal train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve, and a 5-s head lift) and pulmonary function (pulse oximetry: SpO2, and blood gas analysis: SaO2, PaCO2). We defined PORP as a TOF-ratio <70%, hypoxemia as a postoperative SpO2 > or =5% below the pre-anesthestic level together with a postoperative SaO2 <93%, and hypercapnia as a PaCO2 > or =46 mm Hg. Among the 49 pancuronium and 27 vecuronium patients studied, the PORP rates were 20% in the pancuronium group and 7% in the vecuronium group (p>0.05). Hypoxemia and hypercapnia occurred more often in pancuronium patients with PORP than in those without PORP namely 60% vs. 10% (p<0.05) and 30% vs. 8% (p>0.05), respectively. We conclude that PORP after pancuronium is a significant risk factor for hypoxemia.
Appetite suppressants fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and phentermine have been used alone or in combination as an alternative to diet and surgery in the management of obesity. This therapy was halted in 1997 after reports of valvular lesions affecting almost one third of patients treated with these drugs. Fortunately, most cases of appetite suppressant-related valve disease are mild or moderate and rarely required valve repair or replacement. Follow-up studies have suggested improvement in valvulopathy after discontinuation of the treatment. The mechanism of valve disease induced by these drugs is speculative and may be related to their serotonergic effects. Echocardiographic features are similar to carcinoid heart disease and valvulopathy associated with ergot use. Most cases require only follow-up and endocarditis prophylaxis; surgery is rarely needed.
The interrelationship of circulating 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D in children with uremic renalosteodystrophy has been examined in 19 patients treated for 1 to 4 yr with 25(OH)D3. There was a direct correlation between 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D levels when the GFR was less than or equal to 25 but not greater than 25 ml/min/1.73m2 (r = 0.47, P = less than .01). This correlation was unchanged when 1,25(OH)2D was factored by serum phosphorus or serum creatinine but became nonsignificant when 1,25(OH)2D was factored by serum bicarbonate. Overall, parathyroid hormone (PTH) did not change the correlation. However, when the data were subdivided by levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and PTH, the correlation between 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D was significant only when GFR was less than or equal to 25 and the PTH was markedly elevated (P = less than .01), suggesting that a substantial elevation of PTH may be necessary to stimulate 1,25(OH)2D production in these patients. Individual 1,25(OH)2D levels measured over time (1-4 yr) fluctuated regardless of GFR. Despite high serum 25(OH)D3 levels after 25(OH)D3 therapy, there was no consistent increase in the 1,25(OH)2D levels, and many posttreatment levels were lower than pretreatment levels. The kinetics of 1,25(OH)2D metabolism failed to reveal a progressive increase in the serum levels between 2 and 24 hours after a pharmacologic dose of 25(OH)D3.
MLL5 is a novel trithorax group gene and a candidate tumor suppressor gene located within a 2.5-Mb interval of chromosome band 7q22 that frequently is deleted in human myeloid malignancy. Here we show that inactivation of the Mll5 gene in mice results in a 30% reduction in the average representation of hematopoietic stem cells and in functional impairment of long-term hematopoietic repopulation potential under competitive conditions. Bone marrow cells from Mll5-deficient mice were defective in spleen colony-forming assays, and the mutant mice showed enhanced susceptibility to 5-fluorouracil-induced myelosuppression. Heterozygous and homozygous Mll5 mutant mice did not spontaneously develop hematologic cancers, and loss of Mll5 did not alter the phenotype of a fatal myeloproliferative disorder induced by oncogenic Kras in vivo. Collectively, the data reveal an important role for Mll5 in HSC homeostasis and provide a basis for further studies to explore its role in leukemogenesis.
To compare the diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) efficacy and safety of timolol vs latanoprost in subjects with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG).
A 3-month prospective, single-masked, active-controlled, parallel comparison performed in six centres in Greece that randomized subjects in a 1 : 1 ratio to either latanoprost in the evening (2000 hours) and placebo in the morning (0800 hours), or timolol twice daily (0800 and 2000 hours).
In all, 103 subjects completed the study. After 3 months of chronic dosing, the latanoprost group exhibited a trend to a greater diurnal IOP reduction from an untreated baseline (24.9+/-3.2-17.4+/-2.9) compared with timolol (24.7+/-2.8-18.3+/-1.9 mmHg) (P=0.07). Latanoprost showed a significantly greater IOP reduction at 0800 hours (-8.5 vs -6.0 mm Hg for timolol, P<0.0001) whereas no difference was observed between the two medications at 1000, 1400, and 2000 hours after a Bonferroni Correction. In addition, latanoprost demonstrated a narrower range of diurnal IOP (2.4) than timolol (3.2 mmHg)(P=0.0017). Safety was similar between groups, except there was more conjunctival hyperaemia with latanoprost (n=8) than timolol (n=1)(P=0.01).
This study suggests that latanoprost provides a statistically lower 08:00-hour IOP and better range of IOP than timolol in the treatment of XFG glaucoma.
Previous anesthetic induction techniques using the combination of a benzodiazepine (midazolam or diazepam) and fentanyl have been reported to produce marked hypotension. In this study, anesthesia was induced with a combination of lorazepam and fentanyl in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. In 10 patients, anesthesia was induced using an exponentially declining continuous infusion of lorazepam equivalent to a total infused dose of 0.1 mg/kg over 15 minutes, which was supplemented at 10 minutes by fentanyl, 75 micrograms/kg, given as an infusion over 5 minutes. In 8 additional patients, anesthesia was induced with an exponentially declining infusion of fentanyl to a total dose of 75 micrograms/kg over 15 minutes, which was supplemented at 10 minutes by lorazepam, 0.1 mg/kg, given as an infusion over 5 minutes. Hemodynamics were recorded during a 20-minute observation period. One patient in each group required treatment for bradycardia during the initial drug infusion (before the second drug was added). Four additional patients in the group receiving lorazepam followed by fentanyl required treatment for bradycardia or hypotension within 10 minutes of the beginning of the fentanyl infusion. When an infusion of lorazepam was added to the fentanyl infusion, hemodynamics remained stable; however, the reverse order produced a high level of bradycardia and hypotension.
Finasteride is a competitive inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase enzyme, and is used for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenetic alopecia. Animal studies have shown that finasteride might induce behavioral changes. Additionally, some cases of finasteride-induced depression have been reported in humans. The purpose of this study was to examine whether depressive symptoms or anxiety might be induced by finasteride administration.
One hundred and twenty eight men with androgenetic alopecia, who were prescribed finasteride (1 mg/day) were enrolled in this study. Information on depressed mood and anxiety was obtained by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Participants completed BDI and HADS questionnaires before beginning the treatment and also two months after it.
Mean age of the subjects was 25.8(+/- 4.4) years. At baseline, mean BDI and HADS depression scores were 12.11(+/- 7.50) and 4.04(+/- 2.51), respectively. Finasteride treatment increased both BDI (p < 0.001) and HADS depression scores significantly (p = 0.005). HADS anxiety scores were increased, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.061).
This preliminary study suggests that finasteride might induce depressive symptoms; therefore this medication should be prescribed cautiously for patients with high risk of depression. It seems that further studies would be necessary to determine behavioral effects of this medication in higher doses and in more susceptible patients.
DNA polymerase η (pol η) is capable of bypassing DNA adducts produced by cisplatin or oxaliplatin and is associated with cellular tolerance to platinum. Previous studies showed that defective pol η resulted in enhanced cisplatin or oxaliplatin sensitivity in some cell lines. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of pol η protein expression in metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma.
Four gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines were chosen to explore the relationship between pol η protein expression and oxaliplatin sensitivity by western blotting and MTT assay. Eighty metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma patients treated with FOLFOX or XELOX regimen as first-line chemotherapy were analyzed, corresponding pretreatment formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were used to detect pol η protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Relationship between pol η protein expression and clinical features and outcome of these patients was analyzed.
A positive linear relationship between pol η protein expression and 48 h IC50 values of oxaliplatin in four gastric cancer cell lines was observed. Positivity of pol η protein expression was strongly associated with poor treatment response, as well as shorter survival at both univariate (8 versus 14 months; P < 0.001) and multivariate (hazard ratio, 4.555; 95% confidence interval, 2.461-8.429; P < 0.001) analysis in eighty metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma patients.
Our study indicates that pol η is a predictive factor of treatment response and survival of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma patients treated with FOLFOX or XELOX as first-line chemotherapy. Therefore confirming the value of pol η in studies with prospective design is mandatory.
This study was designed to analyze cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and was performed at a University hospital. Nineteen veterans had mustard gas-induced PF, and 19 normal veterans were used as a control group. Chest roentgenograms, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), the percentage diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (D(LCO)), high-resolution CT scans of the chest, and analyses of BAL fluids for five cytokines interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-12, and the growth factors transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were performed in all cases. A transbronchial lung biopsy was done in all patients. There were significant differences in cytokine (IL-8, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-12) levels of BAL fluid between patients with PF and healthy controls. TGF-beta, EGF, and IGF-1 levels were also significantly increased in patients with PF compared with controls. A significant negative correlation was observed between the percentage of D(LCO) and IL-8 levels in BAL fluid in patients with PF (r = -0.47, p = 0.04). A significant negative correlation was also seen between the percentage of D(LCO) and TGF-beta (r = 0.53, p = 0.02) in these patients. Except for the percentage and the absolute number of the BAL fluid neutrophils (r = 0.70, p = 0.001 and r = -0.62, p = 0.005, respectively), no correlation was found between D(LCO)% and the other BAL cells. Of all measured cytokines and growth factors, only IL-8 and TGF-beta showed a significant correlation with the degree of fibrosis (p = 0.004, p = 0.04). The increased levels of cytokines and growth factors in the BAL fluid suggest the possible causative mechanism in the lung in sulfur mustard gas-induced PF by recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils into the lung.
Inhalation of toxic doses of ozone is associated with a sterile inflammatory response characterized by an accumulation of macrophages in the lower lung which are activated to release cytotoxic/proinflammatory mediators that contribute to tissue injury. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern recognition receptor present on macrophages that has been implicated in sterile inflammatory responses. In the present studies we used TLR4 mutant C3H/HeJ mice to analyze the role of TLR4 in ozone-induced lung injury, oxidative stress and inflammation. Acute exposure of control C3H/HeOuJ mice to ozone (0.8ppm for 3h) resulted in increases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lipocalin 24p3 and 4-hydroxynonenal modified protein, markers of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. This was correlated with increases in BAL protein, as well as numbers of alveolar macrophages. Levels of surfactant protein-D, a pulmonary collectin known to regulate macrophage inflammatory responses, also increased in BAL following ozone inhalation. Ozone inhalation was associated with classical macrophage activation, as measured by increased NF-κB binding activity and expression of TNFα mRNA. The observation that these responses to ozone were not evident in TLR4 mutant C3H/HeJ mice demonstrates that functional TLR4 contributes to ozone-induced sterile inflammation and macrophage activation.
Sundowning, manifested as a recurring increase in restlessness and agitation in the evening, is described in a 71-year-old man with clinically diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies. An objective measure of activity using the activity electronic monitoring technique indicated a marked increase in activity level during the evening compared to earlier in the day. After treatment with donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, ratings of behavioural symptoms improved. In addition, there was a marked reduction in evening activity and an increase in daytime activity. Cognition and parkinsonism also improved. Possible explanations for this finding are discussed.
This study attempted to determine the long-term outcome of verapamil-sensitive sustained left ventricular tachycardia in patients without apparent structural heart disease.
Several types of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia have been reported, and their clinical, electrophysiologic and electropharmacologic characteristics are different. It is possible that the prognosis of each type of ventricular tachycardia might also be different.
We studied mortality and morbidity in 37 consecutive patients (27 male, 10 female; mean [+/- SD] age 33 +/- 14 years) with verapamil-sensitive sustained left ventricular tachycardia who had no apparent structural heart disease. Patients were followed up for 1 to 13 years (mean 5.8). Verapamil repeatedly terminated ventricular tachycardia in all patients. Ventricular tachycardia originated from the inferior and inferoseptal regions of the left ventricle in 33 patients and the superior and superioseptal regions in 4. Severity of ventricular tachycardia was classified according to the extent to which symptoms limited daily activities. Ventricular tachycardia was mild (minimal limitation) in 14 patients, moderate (some limitation) in 17 and severe (severe limitation) in 6.
Fourteen patients with mild ventricular tachycardia were followed up without any drug therapy, and the ventricular tachycardia remained mild in all patients. Antiarrhythmic therapy was initiated empirically in the 23 patients with moderate and severe ventricular tachycardia (verapamil in 20, propranolol in 2, digoxin in 1). Moderate ventricular tachycardia became mild ventricular tachycardia after drug therapy in all patients, but the six patients with severe ventricular tachycardia showed no improvement. The six patients with severe ventricular tachycardia had nonpharmacologic therapy (cryosurgery in one, catheter ablation in four, antitachycardia pacing device in one). During the follow-up period, all patients remained alive except for one who died suddenly after implantation of an antitachycardia pacing device.
1) The long-term prognosis of verapamil-sensitive sustained left ventricular tachycardia in patients without apparent structural heart disease is good. 2) Verapamil is the drug of choice for alleviating symptoms, but nonpharmacologic therapy is necessary in some patients.
To report a case of metformin-induced cholestatic hepatitis.
We present a detailed case report, including laboratory and biopsy findings. In addition, similar cases from the literature are reviewed.
In a 68-year-old man with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, metformin therapy was begun. The dosage initially was 500 mg twice daily and later was increased to 850 mg twice a day. Four weeks after met-formin treatment was initiated, jaundice, pruritus, and liver enzyme abnormalities were noted. The patient underwent an extensive work-up, including a hepatitis screen, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, all of which showed normal findings. A liver biopsy revealed severe cholestasis and mild portal inflammation. Treatment with metformin was discontinued, and the liver enzymes normalized except for a persistently increased level of alkaline phosphatase, most likely related to a prolonged cholestatic effect of metformin.
Although rare, metformin can be responsible for inducing liver damage, and patients and physicians should be aware of this side effect.
The SLC30A8 gene codes for a pancreatic beta-cell-expressed zinc transporter, ZnT8. A polymorphism in the SLC30A8 gene is associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, although the molecular mechanism through which this phenotype is manifest is incompletely understood. Such polymorphisms may exert their effect via impacting expression level of the gene product. We used an shRNA-mediated approach to reproducibly downregulate ZnT8 mRNA expression by >90% in the INS-1 pancreatic beta cell line. The ZnT8-downregulated cells exhibited diminished uptake of exogenous zinc, as determined using the zinc-sensitive reporter dye, zinquin. ZnT8-downregulated cells showed reduced insulin content and decreased insulin secretion (expressed as percent of total insulin content) in response to hyperglycemic stimulus, as determined by insulin immunoassay. ZnT8-depleted cells also showed fewer dense-core vesicles via electron microscopy. These data indicate that reduced ZnT8 expression in cultured pancreatic beta cells gives rise to a reduced insulin response to hyperglycemia. In addition, although we provide no direct evidence, these data suggest that an SLC30A8 expression-level polymorphism could affect insulin secretion and the glycemic response in vivo.
There has been a limited amount of research on the long-term effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on growth of the infant, and there has been no use of longitudinal growth models. We investigated the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on offspring growth from 1 through 10 years of age by using a repeated-measures growth-curve model.
Women were enrolled from a prenatal clinic and interviewed at the end of each trimester of pregnancy about their cocaine, crack, alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, and other drug use. Fifty percent of the women were white, and 50% were black. Follow-up assessments occurred at 1, 3, 7, and 10 years of age.
Cross-sectional analyses showed that children exposed to cocaine during the first trimester (n = 99) were smaller on all growth parameters at 7 and 10 years, but not at 1 or 3 years, than the children who were not exposed to cocaine during the first trimester (n = 125). The longitudinal analyses indicated that the growth curves for the 2 groups diverged over time: children who were prenatally exposed to cocaine grew at a slower rate than children who were not exposed. These analyses controlled for other factors associated with child growth.
To our knowledge, this is the first study of the long-term effects of prenatal cocaine exposure to conduct longitudinal growth-curve analyses using 4 time points in childhood. Children who were exposed to cocaine during the first trimester grew at a slower rate than those who were not exposed. These findings indicate that prenatal cocaine exposure has a lasting effect on child development.
Influences of drug-induced manipulations of central serotonergic function on lidocaine- and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions were examined in mice. Agents that suppressed serotonergic transmission increased, whereas drugs that facilitated serotonin (5-HT) function decreased the incidence of lidocaine-induced convulsions. These treatments had similar influences on the incidence of PTZ-induced convulsions. Lidocaine (10(-5)-10(-3) M) reduced the stimulation evoked [3H]5-HT release from cortical slices, followed with an increased spontaneous [3H] overflow at higher concentrations. These results may suggest that brain 5-HT neurons are causally involved as inhibitory neurons in lidocaine-induced convulsions as in the case of PTZ-induced convulsions.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting chemical to which humans are exposed. Continuous environmental exposure to BPA leads to its detection in the majority of individuals from developed countries, with serum concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10ng/ml in the general population and much higher when associated with occupational exposure. In this work, human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human colon adenocarcinona (HT29) cell lines were used to represent endothelial and digestive-tract tissues, which are in direct contact to BPA in vivo. Our results demonstrate that BPA has cell-type differential effects. Notably, BPA concentrations commonly found in humans induce micronucleus formation and interfere with cell-division processes in endothelial cells, resulting in mitotic abnormalities. We also found that BPA induces up-regulation of two genes encoding proteins associated with chromosome segregation, namely CDCA8 (borealin/cell division cycle A8) and SGOL2 (shugoshin-like2). Taken together, the aneugenic effects observed in endothelial cells (HUVECs) substantiate increasing concerns about BPA exposure at levels currently detected in humans.
The effect of vitamin E on gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive foci, with or without phenobarbital, was investigated. Groups of six female Sprague-Dawley rats were initiated with diethylnitrosamine (15 mg/kg) at 24 hours of age. After weaning, they were fed diets with 10% (wt/wt) fish oil; the diets contained 0, 5,000 or 15,000 ppm vitamin E supplementation with or without phenobarbital (500 ppm) for six months. Phenobarbital significantly increased liver weight and liver weight as a percentage of body weight (p < 0.05), suggesting a liver hypertrophic effect of phenobarbital. Phenobarbital significantly decreased hepatic phospholipid arachidonate, eicosapentaenoate, and docosahexaenoate (p < 0.05); this may indicate that phenobarbital stimulates phospholipase A2 activity and results in the increased release of polyunsaturated fatty acids from phospholipids and the decrease of hepatic phospholipid polyunsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio. In rats fed phenobarbital, hepatic vitamin E content was lower than in rats fed no phenobarbital; this suggests that phenobarbital causes oxidative stress or induces enzymes that metabolize the vitamin. Phenobarbital exposure significantly increased hepatic prostaglandin F2 alpha and glutathione S-transferase activity (p < 0.05). Vitamin E did not influence hepatic gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive foci area and number with or without phenobarbital, and phenobarbital showed a strong promoting action on enzyme-altered hepatic foci.
Among children receiving methylphenidate hydrochloride, tics developed in 14, and in six children with pre-existing tics, the tics became worse. The clinical diagnosis in 19 cases was minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), and in one case, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. Duration and dose of medication showed no particular pattern. In only one case did tics persist unchanged after methylphenidate treatment was discontinued. Tics related to methylphenidate administration appear to be rare (20 of 1,520 cases, or 1.3%) and may point to a specific susceptibility possibly related to personality profile (obsessive, perseverative, withdrawn).
We conducted a retrospective case-control study to compare the frequency of myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina (UA) precipitated by aspirin-induced upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding among patients with and without ischemic heart disease(IHD), and to determine whether the risk of MI or UA is related to the hemoglobin level on admission. Of the 51 patients admitted to the hospital between 1987 and 1994 because of aspirin-induced upper GI bleeding, 33 had ischemic heart disease. The prevalence of MI and UA inpatients with IHD and aspirin-induced upper GI bleeding was significantly higher than in patients without IHD (42% vs. 5.5% respectively) (P < 0.005). Of the patients with upper GI bleeding and a hemoglobin concentration of 5-8 g/dl, 75% had either MI or UA in comparison to 50% and 18% of the patients with hemoglobin concentrations of 8-10 and 10-14 g/dl respectively. We conclude that low dose aspirin therapy may precipitate MI or UA, especially in patients with IHD, by inducing upper GI bleeding. Patients with IHD who use low dose aspirin to prevent MI should be instructed how to identify emerging symptoms of peptic ulcer as well as the initial signs of upper GI bleeding. Early diagnosis and treatment of these patients might prevent the induction of secondary MI or UA.
To test the hypothesis that female prevalence is greater than expected among reported cases of torsades de pointes associated with cardiovascular drugs that prolong cardiac repolarization.
A MEDLINE search of the English-language literature for the period of 1980 through 1992, using the terms torsade de pointes, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, atypical ventricular tachycardia, proarrhythmia, and drug-induced ventricular tachycardia, supplemented by pertinent references (dating back to 1964) from the reviewed articles and by personal communications with researchers involved in this field.
Ninety-three articles were identified describing at least one case of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (with gender specified) associated with quinidine, procainamide hydrochloride, disopyramide, amiodarone, sotalol hydrochloride, bepridil hydrochloride, or prenylamine. A total of 332 patients were included in the analysis following application of prospectively defined criteria (eg, corrected QT [QTc] interval of 0.45 second or greater while receiving drug).
Clinical and electrocardiographic descriptors were extracted for analysis. Expected female prevalence for torsades de pointes associated with quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, and aminodarone was conservatively estimated from gender-specific data reported for antiarrhythmic drug prescriptions in 1986, as derived from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, a large pharmaceutical database; expected female prevalence for torsades de pointes associated with sotalol, bepridil, and prenylamine was assumed to be 50% or less since these agents are prescribed for male-predominant cardiovascular conditions.
Women made up 70% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 75%) of the 332 reported cases of cardiovascular-drug-related torsades de pointes, and a female prevalence exceeding 50% was observed in 20 (83%) of 24 studies having at least four included cases. When analyzed according to various descriptors, women still constituted the majority (range, 51% to 94% of torsades de pointes cases), irrespective of the presence or absence of underlying coronary artery or rheumatic heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction, type of underlying arrhythmia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, concomitant digoxin treatment, or level of QTc at baseline or while receiving drug. When cases of torsades de pointes were analyzed by individual drug, observed female prevalence was always greater than expected, representing a statistically significant difference (P < .05) for all agents except procainamide.
These findings strongly suggest that women are more prone than men to develop torsades de pointes during administration of cardiovascular drugs that prolong cardiac repolarization. The pathophysiological basis for, and therapeutic implications of, this gender disparity should be further investigated.
This report describes a 29-year-old bodybuilder taking anabolic steroids who presented with urinary retention, arthralgias, and peripheral edema, subsequently developed acute lower-extremity paralysis, and was diagnosed as having transverse myelitis and membranous glomerulonephritis secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The association of anabolic steroid use and hyperprolactinemia, and their possible link to the development of SLE, are reviewed.
X-linked Recessive Chondrodysplasia Punctata (CDPX1) is due to a defect in arylsulfatase E (ARSE), located on Xp22.3. Neither the substrate nor function of the encoded warfarin-sensitive arylsulfatase has been identified and molecular analysis remains the only confirmatory diagnostic test. Nevertheless, the majority of patients evaluated have not had identifiable mutations in ARSE, and thus far 23 patients have been reported. The major clinical features in these patients are also present in a group now recognized as phenocopies, due to vitamin K deficiency in early gestation or maternal autoimmune disease. We evaluated the ARSE gene in 11 patients who met clinical criteria for CDPX1. We amplified all exons and intronic flanking sequence from each patient, and investigated suspected deletions or rearrangements by southern analysis. We identified mutations in seven individuals. Of the remainder, three had maternal conditions that further expand the phenocopy group. Thus, this group might represent a proportion of the mutation-negative patients in previous studies. We extracted clinical information from all prior reports over the past decade and show that there are few distinguishing features on examination between these two groups of patients. This study supports heterogeneity for CDPX1-like phenotypes and sorting these out will help to define the biological pathway and genetic contributors.
