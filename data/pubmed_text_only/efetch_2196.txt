Pleurotus eryngii is a nutritional and medicinal food rich in polysaccharides that enhance the host immune system as a response to various diseases. The present study investigated the effects of P. eryngii extracts (PEE) on the progress of atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice induced by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). We evaluated skin dermatitis severity, ear thickness, histopathological examination, and cytokines level in DNCB-applied mice treated with PEE. Continuous treatment of PEE inhibited the development of the AD-like skin lesions. PEE suppressed DNCB-induced dermatitis severity, serum level of IgE and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), and mRNA expression of TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in mice. In addition, PEE reduced thickness of the dermis and dermal infiltration of inflammatory cells and mast cells in histopathological examination. These results indicate that PEE inhibits allergic contact dermatitis through the modulating of T helper (Th)1 and Th2 responses and diminishing the inflammatory cells and mast cells infiltration in the skin lesions in NC/Nga mice.
Dopamine receptor antagonism is associated not only with antipsychotic action, but also with the generation of extrapyramidal side-effects of antipsychotic medications. Positron emission tomography studies reveal that an approximate 60-70% blockade of the D2 receptors is required for typical antipsychotics to be efficacious, but a blockade of > or =75-80% results in acute extrapyramidal side-effects. The newer atypical antipsychotics have a lower propensity to produce extrapyramidal side-effects. A new class of antipsychotics with a novel pharmacological profile and improved tolerability have emerged, comprising the 'dopamine-serotonin system stabilizers' of which aripiprazole is the first agent. We present the case of a patient who developed parkinsonism during treatment with aripiprazole.
1. Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency and increased superoxide (O2-) production. Atorvastatin (Ato) possesses pleiotropic properties that have been reported to improve endothelial function through increased availability of NO and reduced O2- production in various forms of hypertension. In the present study, we investigated whether 50 mg/kg per day, p.o., Ato could prevent endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) downregulation and the increase in O2- in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, thereby reducing blood pressure. 2. Male SD rats (n = 30) were treated with Ato (50 mg/kg per day in drinking water) or tap water for 15 days. Dexamethasone (10 microg/kg per day, s.c.) or saline was started after 4 days in Ato-treated and non-treated rats and continued for 11-13 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured on alternate days using the tail-cuff method. Endothelial function was assessed by acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation and phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction in aortic segments. Vascular eNOS mRNA was assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 3. In rats treated with Dex alone, SBP was increased from 109 +/- 2 to 133 +/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 and Day 14, respectively (P < 0.001). In the Ato + Dex group, SBP was increased from 113 +/- 2 to 119 +/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 to 14, respectively (P < 0.001), but was significantly lower than SBP in the group treated with Dex alone (P < 0.05). Endothelial-dependent relaxation and eNOS mRNA expression were greater in the Dex + Ato group than in the Dex only group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Aortic superoxide production was lower in the Dex + Ato group compared with the group treated with Dex alone (P < 0.0001). 4. Treatment with Ato improved endothelial function, reduced superoxide production and reduced SBP in Dex-treated SD rats.
Recent studies have demonstrated that PPARgamma ligands have anti-inflammatory effect which is involved in ventricular remodeling. So we hypothesized that PPARgamma ligand may have beneficial effects on post-infarct ventricular remodeling.
Experimental myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in SD rats by ligation of the left coronary artery. Twenty-four hours after surgery, survival rats were randomly divided into MI group and Rosiglitazone (MI+Ros) group which would take rosiglitazone 3 mg/kg day for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks treatment, left ventricular hemodynamics were measured and organs were weighed. Myocardial collagen analysis was determined in Van Gieson staining by quantitative morphometry. Myocardial angiotensin II and aldosterone were detected by radioimmunoassay. Myocardial AT1 and AT2 mRNA expression were determined by RT-PCR.
Only 1 rat in MI group died of anesthesia at the 8th week. Rosiglitazone treatment could improve left ventricular +/-dp/dt(max), collagen volume fraction and perivascular circumferential area; reduce lung/body mass ratio and liver/body mass ratio; inhibit myocardial angiotensin II and aldosterone; and had no significant effects on myocardial AT1 and AT2 mRNA. Plasma insulin and blood glucose were comparable between two groups.
PPARgamma ligand has neutral effect on mortality and beneficial effect on post-infarct ventricular remodeling, partly by suppressing myocardial angiotensin II and aldosterone, irrespective of plasma insulin and blood glucose level.
1. Serotonin (5-HT), as a type of mitogen for smooth muscle cells, plays an important role in the development of pulmonary hypertension. It is known that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) inhibit 5-HT internalization. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of the SSRI sertraline against pulmonary hypertension. 2. Monocrotaline (MCT)-induced chronic 'inflammatory' pulmonary hypertension in Wistar rats was established. Pulmonary haemodynamic measurement and lung tissue morphological investigations were undertaken. Serotonin transporter (SERT) mRNA was assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 3. The results showed that pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was significantly increased by MCT treatment from 12.6 +/- 2.1 to 20.1 +/- 3.4 mmHg (P < 0.01 vs control) and sertraline attenuated the MCT-induced increase in PAP from 20.1 +/- 3.4 to 16.4 +/- 1.8 mmHg (P < 0.05 vs MCT). The right ventricular index was increased in the MCT-treated group from 0.32 +/- 0.04 to 0.51 +/- 0.09 (P < 0.01 vs control) and was reduced to 0.42 +/- 0.04 by sertraline (P < 0.05 vs MCT). The degree of muscularization of the pulmonary artery in the MCT-treated group was significantly higher than control (P < 0.01) and was decreased by sertraline (P < 0.01 vs MCT). The RT-PCR assay showed that MCT increased SERT mRNA expression from 0.86 +/- 0.08 to 0.99 +/- 0.06 (P < 0.05 vs control), which was attenuated by sertraline (0.82 +/- 0.09; P < 0.05 vs MCT). 4. In conclusion, the SSRI sertraline protects against MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension by decreasing PAP, right ventricular index and pulmonary artery remodelling, which may be related to a reduction in SERT mRNA.
Nitric oxide (NO), a free radical, has been found to be important in the development of middle ear effusions. However, the effect of NO in the middle ear effusion on cochlear function and on perilymph concentrations of NO has not been reported. We placed S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a NO donor compound, on the round window membrane (RWM) of adult chinchillas. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were measured before and after the placement of SNAP on the RWM and hourly for 8 h after SNAP placement. Samples of perilymph were collected 2 h after application of SNAP and were assayed for total nitrate and nitrite, the end products of NO. Experimental ears demonstrated significant ABR threshold elevations after 5 h and elevated nitrate/nitrite in the perilymph. These findings suggest that NO present in the middle ear passes through the RWM into the inner ear and can cause significant hearing loss.
Recent investigations suggest that the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) signaling cascade may be associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and methamphetamine (METH) use disorder. One important molecule related to this cascade is beta-arrestin 2 (ARRB2). We therefore conducted a genetic case-control association analysis of the gene for ARRB2 with schizophrenia and METH use disorder in a Japanese population (547 people with schizophrenia, 177 with METH use disorder and 546 controls). A possible association of 'tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)' was found in METH use disorder (rs1045280: P(genotype) = 0.0118, P(allele) = 0.00351; rs2036657: P(allele) = 0.0431; rs4790694: P(genotype) = 0.0167, P(allele) = 0.0202), but no association was found with schizophrenia. We also evaluated the gene-gene interactions among ARRB2, AKT1, and GSK3B, which we previously reported for each of these diseases. However, no interaction was seen in our samples. This is the first association analysis of ARRB2, and our results indicate that ARRB2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of METH use disorder.
Royal jelly (RJ) is known to contain excellent nutrition and a variety of biological activities. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of RJ on insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia) in fructose-drinking rats (FDR; insulin resistance animal model). Male Wistar rats (6 weeks old) received 15% fructose solution in drinking water for 8 weeks. FDR showed significant increases in plasma levels of insulin and triglyceride, Homeostasis Model Assessment ratio (HOMA-R, an index of insulin resistance), and systolic blood pressure, but not blood glucose levels, when compared with control rats. RJ (100, 300 mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 8 weeks significantly decreased the plasma levels of insulin and triglyceride, HOMA-R, without affecting blood glucose or total cholesterol levels and tended to lower systolic blood pressure. In isolated and perfused mesenteric vascular beds of FDR, RJ treatment resulted in a significant reduction in sympathetic nerve-mediated vasoconstrictor response to periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS) and tended to increase the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) nerve-mediated vasodilator response to PNS, compared with those in untreated FDR. However, RJ treatment did not significantly affect norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction or CGRP-induced vasodilation. These results suggest that RJ could be an effective functional food to prevent insulin resistance associated with the development of hypertension.
After surgical removal of the primary tumor and recurrence of hypoglycemia, a dog with metastatic pancreatic islet cell carcinoma was treated with streptozotocin. Nephrotoxicosis resulted after a single administration of streptozotocin.
The effect of three times daily oral ondansetron in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting was investigated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre studies. The first study compared ondansetron 1, 8 and 16 mg to placebo, and the second study compared 8 mg ondansetron to placebo. Both studies included ASA Class I-III female patients about to undergo major abdominal gynaecological surgery or vaginal hysterectomy. In the first study, the 8 and 16 mg ondansetron groups had a significantly lower incidence of nausea and vomiting in the 0-24 h period following recovery from anaesthesia than the placebo group. Ondansetron 8 mg three times daily was also significantly better than placebo in the second study. Side-effects mainly consisted of constipation, headache, and asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes. The incidence of side-effects was similar in ondansetron- and placebo-treated patients. There appeared to be no clinically important benefit of the 16 mg three times daily ondansetron regimen over the 8 mg three times daily dose, therefore 8 mg three times daily is recommended as the optimal oral dose in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting.
Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal, Timox) is structurally related to carbamazepine and has anticonvulsant activity. Studies suggest that the anticonvulsant activity of oxcarbazepine is mediated via the blocking of neuronal ion channels. In patients aged <18 years, the efficacy of oxcarbazepine monotherapy was similar to that of phenytoin in children with partial onset or generalised tonic-clonic seizures in a 48-week trial. Additional supporting findings demonstrated that 43-71% of patients with partial onset, generalised or undetermined epilepsy were seizure free after oxcarbazepine monotherapy (mean dosage 27.7-50 mg/kg/day; duration 1-5 years). In contrast, one small nonblind trial showed more patients treated with oxcarbazepine monotherapy than with carbamazepine monotherapy had recurrent seizures during 16 months of therapy (although the conclusions that can be drawn from this trial are limited). As adjunctive therapy, oxcarbazepine was significantly better than placebo at reducing seizure frequency in children and adolescents with refractory partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation: the median percentage change in partial onset seizure frequency was 35% versus 9%, respectively, during 16 weeks of therapy. In noncomparative trials of adjunctive oxcarbazepine (mean dosage of 34.5-56.7 mg/kg/day), 7-11% of patients with partial onset or generalised seizures were seizure free during treatment, and 20-54% had seizure reductions of > or =50%. Oxcarbazepine was generally well tolerated during monotherapy and adjunctive therapy; 2.5% and 10% of patients withdrew from well controlled trials of oxcarbazepine monotherapy and adjunctive therapy. Oxcarbazepine monotherapy was better tolerated than phenytoin and events observed in oxcarbazepine-treated patients were transient. Oxcarbazepine metabolism is largely unaffected by induction of the cytochrome (CYP) P450 system. However, oxcarbazepine can inhibit CYP2C19 and induce CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, thereby interfering with the metabolism of other drugs (e.g. phenytoin). In addition, oxcarbazepine decreases plasma levels of oral contraceptives and alternative contraceptive methods should be used. In conclusion, oxcarbazepine (as both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) has shown efficacy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in children with epilepsy. Nevertheless, the generally favorable tolerability profile and relatively low potential for drug interactions of oxcarbazepine make it a valuable option in the treatment of childhood epilepsy.
Four patients with rheumatoid arthritis developed heavy proteinuria after five to 12 months of treatment with D-penicillamine. Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase, or no departure from normal. Electron microscopy, however, revealed subepithelial electron-dense deposits, fusion of epithelial cell foot processes, and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3. The findings were similar to those in early membranous glomerulonephritis, differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early-acting complement components C1q and C4. It is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway.
We recently reported changes in the density of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in cerebral cortex of mice treated neonatally with DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane) and receiving bioallethrin as adults. We also found behavioural aberrations in adult mice treated with bioallethrin, whether neonatally treated with DDT or the vehicle. To ascertain whether these changes were permanent, 10-day-old mice received an oral dose of DDT (0.5 mg/kg body weight) and at the age of 5 months they received bioallethrin orally (0.7 mg/kg body weight/day; 7 days). The animals were investigated at the age of 7 months. Here we report muscarinic acetylcholine receptor changes, additional behavioural disturbances and learning disabilities in mice receiving DDT as neonates and bioallethrin as adults, whereas the behavioural disturbances in mice receiving vehicle as neonates and bioallethrin as adults had diminished and changes in proportions of high- and low-affinity binding sites had developed. No changes in the density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were noted for any of the treated groups. In conclusion, exposure of neonates to DDT leads to increased susceptibility in adults to a short-acting pesticide with similar neurotoxic action. An adult exposure to this short-acting pesticide to mice neonatally exposed to DDT leads to irreversible muscarinic acetylcholine receptor changes and behavioural disturbances with additional changes 2 months after the exposure.
Psychotropics are among the most common causes of drug induced acquired long QT syndrome. Blockage of Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel by psychoactive drugs appears to be related to this adverse effect. Antipsychotics such as haloperidol, thioridazine, sertindole, pimozide, risperidone, ziprasidone, quetiapine, olanzapine and antidepressants such as amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, trazadone, fluoxetine depress the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) in a dose dependent manner in experimental models. The frequency of QTc prolongation (more than 456 ms) in psychiatric patients is estimated to be 8%. Age over 65 years, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), thioridazine, droperidol, olanzapine, and higher antipsychotic doses were predictors of significant QTc prolongation. In large epidemiological controlled studies a dose dependent increased risk of sudden death has been identified in current users of antipsychotics (conventional and atypical) and of TCA. Thioridazine and haloperidol shared a similar relative risk of SCD. Lower doses of risperidone had a higher relative risk than haloperidol for cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia. No increased risk was identified in current users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Cases of TdP have been reported with thioridazine, haloperidol, ziprazidone, olanzapine and TCA. Evidence of QTc prolongation with sertindole is significant and this drug has not been approved by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). A large trial is ongoing to evaluate the cardiac risk profile of ziprazidone and olanzapine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been associated with QTc prolongation but no cases of TdP have been reported with the use of these agents. There are no reported cases of lithium induced TdP. Risk factors for drug induced LQT syndrome and TdP include: female gender, concomitant cardiovascular disease, substance abuse, drug interactions, bradychardia, electrolyte disorders, anorexia nervosa, and congenital Long QT syndrome. Careful selection of the psychotropic and identification of patient's risk factors for QTc prolongation is applicable in current clinical practice.
Previously, we have found an association between the -48 A/G polymorphism of the dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) gene and bipolar disorder. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible association of this polymorphism with the quality of the prophylactic lithium response in bipolar patients.
Ninety-two patients (39 male, 53 female), aged 30-77 (mean: 54 years) were studied. They have received lithium for prophylactic purposes for 5-27 years (mean: 15 years). Twenty-four patients were identified as excellent lithium responders (ER), 48 patients as partial responders (PR), and 20 patients were non-responders (NR). They all were genotyped for -48 A/G polymorphism of the DRD1 gene.
The frequency of G/G genotype in ER, PR, and NR patients was 21%, 48%, and 60%, respectively, and the frequency of G allele was 58%, 76%, and 80%, respectively.
The results obtained suggest that the higher frequency of G allele, and G/G genotype, which has been associated with a predisposition to bipolar illness, is also connected with a poorer prophylactic effect of lithium.
Acute dystonia is commonly associated with high-potency antipsychotics. Some cases of acute dystonia had been reported to be associated with antidepressant. However, only few reported cases are related to bupropion. As reported herein, the patient with major depression suffered from acute dystonia twice, which resulted from abrupt bupropion discontinuation. The first episode occurred when medicament was shifted from bupropion to duloxetine abruptly. The patient was requested with nothing per mouth (NPO) due to panendoscopic examination. Therefore, the second one emerged after the patient was suspended from two doses of bupropion. The symptoms of dysphagia, trismus and torticollis in these two episodes were resolved after bupropion reinstitution or biperiden injection. So far as we know by our documents, this is the first report concerning an acute dystonia resulting from bupropion discontinuation.
Finasteride is an antiandrogen, inhibits type II 5-alpha reductase (enzyme that converts testosterone to more potent form dihydrotestosterone), and is commonly used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and male frontal baldness; however, it is not free from side effects, which include sexual dysfunction and, rarely, myopathy. We report a case of finasteride-associated myalgia and hyperCKemia and review similar cases reported in the literature.
A 30-year-old man who had been taking finasteride 5 mg/d for 10 years to treat frontal baldness developed diffuse muscle aches associated with elevated creatine kinase level to 10,117 IU/L with neither weakness nor pigmenturia. His symptoms resolved and his creatine kinase level dropped down to 256 IU/L 3 weeks after finasteride discontinuation.
Reversible myalgia associated with significant hyperCKemia is a possible adverse reaction of finasteride therapy.
Dominantly acting, allelic mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene have been described in five craniosynostosis syndromes. In Apert syndrome, characterised by syndactyly of the hands and feet, recurrent mutations of a serine-proline dipeptide (either Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg) in the linker between the IgII and IgIII extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, have been documented in more than 160 unrelated individuals. We have identified three novel mutations of this dipeptide, associated with distinct phenotypes. A C-->T mutation that predicts a Ser252Leu substitution, ascertained in a boy with mild Crouzon syndrome (craniosynostosis with normal limbs) is also present in three clinically normal members of his family. A CG-->TT mutation that predicts a Ser252Phe substitution results in a phenotype consistent with Apert syndrome. Finally, a CGC-->TCT mutation that predicts a double amino acid substitution (Ser252Phe and Pro253Ser) causes a Pfeiffer syndrome variant with mild craniosynostosis, broad thumbs and big toes, fixed extension of several digits, and only minimal cutaneous syndactyly. The observation that the Ser252Phe mutation causes Apert syndrome, whereas the other single or double substitutions are associated with milder or normal phenotypes, highlights the exquisitely specific molecular pathogenesis of the limb and craniofacial abnormalities associated with Apert syndrome. Ser252Phe is the first noncanonical mutation to be identified in this disorder, its rarity being explained by the requirement for two residues of the serine codon to be mutated. The description of independent, complex nucleotide substitutions involving identical nucleotides is unprecedented, and we speculate that this may result from functional selection of FGFR mutations in sperm.
Capsaicin and its analogue N-arachidonoyl-vanillyl-amine (arvanil) are agonists of vanilloid VR1 receptors, and suppress spontaneous activity in mice through an unknown mechanism. Here, we tested in rats the effect on motor behavior of: (1) capsaicin; (2) N-linoleoyl-vanillyl-amine (livanil) and N-alpha-linolenoyl-vanillyl-amine (linvanil), which, unlike arvanil, have very little affinity for cannabinoid CB1 receptors; and (3) the endocannabinoid anandamide (N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine), which is a full agonist at both cannabinoid CB1 and vanilloid VR1 receptors. All compounds, administered i.p., dose-dependently (0.1-10 mg/kg) inhibited ambulation and stereotypic behavior and increased inactivity in the open field test. The rank of potency observed in vivo (livanil>capsaicin>linvanil>anandamide) bore little resemblance with the relative potencies in a functional assay for rat vanilloid VR1 receptors (livanil=linvanil>capsaicin>anandamide) and even less with the relative affinities in rat CB1 receptor binding assays (anandamide>livanil>linvanil>capsaicin). The vanilloid VR1 receptor antagonist capsazepine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked the effect of capsaicin but not of livanil or anandamide, whereas the CB1 receptor antagonist (N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide.HCl (SR141716A, 3 mg/kg, i.p.) antagonized the actions of the CB1 receptor agonist Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, but not of livanil, anandamide or capsaicin. Anandamide occluded the effects of livanil on locomotion, possibly suggestive of a common mechanism of action for the two compounds. Finally, stimulation with capsaicin of cells expressing rat vanilloid VR1 receptors led to anandamide formation. These data suggest that motor behavior can be suppressed by the activation of: (1) vanilloid receptors, possibly via the intermediacy of anandamide; or (2) capsazepine- and SR141716A-insensitive sites of action for anandamide, livanil and linvanil, possibly the same that were previously suggested to mediate arvanil hypokinetic effects in mice.
This prospective study examined the incidence of mania or hypomania in 230 patients with recurrent depression treated with imipramine. Overall, only six individuals (2.6%) developed hypomania, representing 0.9% of those in the acute phase and 2.5% of those in the continuation phase of drug treatment. Patients with a history of bipolar II depression (N = 33) did not have a greater incidence of hypomania than those with unipolar depression (N = 197). Younger patients did not switch to hypomania more rapidly than older ones, and women were not more likely to switch than men. Systematic assessment of mania, stringent diagnostic criteria, and the recurrent nature of the sample may account for this low incidence of hypomania compared to that reported by other investigators.
The currently recommended treatment for metronidazole toxicosis is drug discontinuation and supportive therapy. Reported recovery times are 1-2 weeks. The records of 21 dogs with metronidazole toxicosis were retrospectively analyzed to determine whether diazepam improved recovery. The dosage and duration of metronidazole therapy and the response and recovery times of 13 dogs treated with diazepam were compared to those of 8 dogs receiving only supportive care. Response time was defined as the time to resolution of the debilitating clinical signs. Recovery time was the time to resolution of all residual clinical signs. The average dosage and duration of metronidazole administration for the diazepam-treated and untreated groups were 60.3 mg/kg/d for 44.9 days and 65.1 mg/kg/d for 37.25 days. The protocol for diazepam administration consisted of an initial i.v. bolus and then diazepam PO q8h for 3 days. The average dosage of both the i.v. and PO diazepam was 0.43 mg/kg. The average response time for the diazepam-treated dogs was 13.4 hours compared to 4.25 days for the untreated group. Recovery time also was markedly shorter for the diazepam-treated dogs (38.8 hours) compared to the untreated group (11 days). Results of this study showed that dogs with metronidazole toxicosis recover faster when treated with diazepam. Although the mechanism of metronidazole toxicosis or how diazepam exerts its favorable effect is not known, it is likely related to modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor within the cerebellar and vestibular systems.
Studies have found increased bladder cancer risks associated with high levels of arsenic in drinking water, but little information exists about risks at lower concentrations. Ecologic studies in Argentina have found increased bladder cancer mortality in Córdoba Province, where some wells are contaminated with moderate arsenic concentrations. This population-based bladder cancer case-control study in two Córdoba counties recruited 114 case-control pairs, matched on age, sex, and county, during 1996-2000. Water samples, particularly from wells, were obtained from subjects' current residences and residences in the last 40 years. Statistical analyses showed no evidence of associations with exposure estimates based on arsenic concentrations in drinking water. However, when well-water consumption per se was used as the exposure measure, time-window analyses suggested that use of well water more than 50 years before interview was associated with increased bladder cancer risk. This association was limited to ever smokers (odds ratio = 2.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 5.5 for 51-70 years before interview), and the possibility that this association is due to chance cannot be excluded. This study suggests lower bladder cancer risks for arsenic than predicted from other studies but adds to evidence that the latency for arsenic-induced bladder cancers may be longer than previously thought.
A possible link between Parkinson's disease and pesticide exposure has been suggested, and recently it was shown that the herbicide atrazine (ATR) modulates catecholamine metabolism in PC12 cells and affects basal ganglia function in vivo. Hence, the objectives of this study were to: (i) determine if ATR is capable of modulating dopamine (DA) metabolism in striatal tissue slices in vitro and (ii) explore possible mechanisms of its effects. Striatal tissues from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated with up to 500 microM ATR in a metabolic shaker bath at 37 degrees C and an atmosphere of 95% O(2) and 5% CO(2) for 4h. At the end of incubation, samples were collected for both tissue and media levels of DA and its metabolites (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, DOPAC and homovanillic acid, HVA), which were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). To gain some mechanistic insight in to the way ATR affects DA metabolism, several pharmacological manipulations were performed. Striata exposed to ATR at concentrations of 100 microM and greater had a dose-dependent decrease of tissue levels of DA. At doses of ATR 50 microM and greater, the DOPAC+HVA/DA ratio was dose-dependently increased. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis) protein levels and activity were not affected by ATR treatment. However, high potassium-induced DA release into the medium was decreased, whereas the increase in media DA observed in the presence of the DA uptake inhibitor nomifensine was increased even further by ATR in a dose-dependent manner. All of these effects of ATR were observed at levels that were not toxic to the tissue, as LDH release into the medium (lactate dehydrogenase, an index of non-specific cytotoxicity) was not affected by ATR. Taken together, results from this study suggest that ATR decreases tissue DA levels not by affecting TH activity, but possibly by interfering with the vesicular storage and/or cellular uptake of DA.
