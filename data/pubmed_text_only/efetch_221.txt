We report a case of isorhythmic atrio-ventricular dissociation caused by pancuronium. The possible mechanism of the rhythm disorder is discussed and the haemodynamic consequences are described. It will be useful to realise that the circulatory effects of the arrhythmia may be pronounced in patients with decreased cardiovascular reserve.
As onset time and duration of sensory block are intermediate, mepivacaine is widely used for regional anaesthesia. Few reports of systemic adverse effects are available following nerve blockade with mepivacaine. We report the case of a 54-year-old patient suffering from terminal renal failure who needs the confection of an arteriovenous shunt under axillary brachial plexus block. At completion of the injection of 25 ml (375 mg) of 1.5% mepivacaine the patient presented dysarthria, mental confusion followed by a loss of verbal contact and agitation, but no convulsion or cardiac dysrythmia. The patient received midazolam and surgery was planned the following day under general anaesthesia. Plasma mepivacaine concentration at time of neurological signs was measured at 5.1 microg/ml. Prevention and treatment of systemic toxic effects after regional anaesthesia are discussed.
RPE65 is a protein of unknown function expressed specifically by the retinal pigment epithelium. We examined all 14 exons of this gene in 147 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP), in 15 patients with isolate RP, and in 45 patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Sequence anomalies that were likely to be pathogenic were found in two patients with recessive RP, in one patient with isolate RP recategorized as recessive, and in seven patients with LCA. Cosegregation analysis in each available family showed that all affected individuals were either homozygotes or compound heterozygotes and that all unaffected individuals were either heterozygote carriers or homozygous wild type. In one family, there was one instance of a new mutation not present in either parent of the affected individual. In another family, affected members with recessive RP in three branches (i.e., three distinct pairs of parents) were compound heterozygotes for the same two mutations or homozygous for one of them. Based on our results, mutations in the RPE65 gene appear to account for approximately 2% of cases of recessive RP and approximately 16% of cases of LCA.
Compound 4 (PF-04971729) belongs to a new class of potent and selective sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors incorporating a unique dioxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane (bridged ketal) ring system. In this paper we present the design, synthesis, preclinical evaluation, and human dose predictions related to 4. This compound demonstrated robust urinary glucose excretion in rats and an excellent preclinical safety profile. It is currently in phase 2 clinical trials and is being evaluated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Acutely, methamphetamine (m-AMPH) is known to stimulate a net efflux of dopamine (DA) in the striatum while inhibiting DA uptake, thus producing high extracellular concentrations of DA. Repeated administration of m-AMPH has been shown to damage DA terminals in the striatum. However, little direct information exists about the relationship between m-AMPH-induced DA overflow and neurotoxicity. In the present study, we used in vivo microdialysis to explore this topic. Four, but not 3, injections of m-AMPH (4 mg/kg, sc, at 2 h intervals) damaged striatal DA terminals as measured by a 43-51% decrease in post mortem striatal DA content 1 week later. Striatal microdialysis in awake animals during the course of m-AMPH treatment showed that DA overflow increased after each m-AMPH injection, but that approximately 1.5 h after the fourth m-AMPH injection, a striking increase in DA overflow occurred that was significantly larger than that seen after any of the previous 3 injections. Additionally, in animals receiving 4 injections of m-AMPH, cumulative DA overflow was negatively correlated with striatal DA content 1 week later (r = -0.74, P less than 0.05), suggesting that the substantial DA overflow seen after the fourth m-AMPH injection is especially important in m-AMPH neurotoxicity.
We report a case of hepatitis in a 58-year-old woman being treated with thalidomide for end-stage plasma cell leukemia. The patient had a medical history including chronic stable hepatitis C infection. At diagnosis there was a severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, IgG paraproteinemia, peripheral blood myeloma cells, and a marrow plasmacytosis with lytic bony lesion. The disease was refractory to standard chemotherapy, and she was treated with oral thalidomide. Within 1 week she became jaundiced and developed a marked transaminitis. This promptly resolved upon cessation of thalidomide alone. Thalidomide has recently enjoyed renewed interest as a treatment in many disorders, including plasma cell leukemia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of thalidomide-associated hepatotoxicity. Although the mechanism of its actions on the liver are uncertain, it is possible that thalidomide acts as a direct hepatotoxin or as an immuno-modulator, altering the activity of chronic viral hepatitis. We present this case to increase awareness of a new potential side effect of thalidomide as its clinical indications expand.
A 31-year-old female had recurring palpitations and black-outs for 13 years. Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed and electrocardiogram suggested ventricular preexcitation. Despite being treated for hyperthyroidism (which rendered the patient hypothyroid) and receiving propranolol for the arrhythmia, the palpitations persisted. Electrophysiologic testing identified the patient's arrhythmia, and demonstrated that it improved with intravenous propafenone, a new type 1C antiarrhythmic medication. After two days of oral propafenone, this initially good response was followed by episodes of Torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia with repeated cardiac arrest. Lidocaine and isoproterenol failed to control the rhythm, and the patient was stabilized by electrical cardioversions, atrial pacing and withdrawing the propafenone. Propafenone has been used to treat Torsade de pointes, but we show that it may also cause Torsade de pointes.
Relapse to drug craving is problematic in treatment for drug abuse. Evidence suggests inactivation of dopaminergic neurotransmission during drug withdrawal. Meanwhile, a tryptamine analogue, (-)-1-(benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane [(-)-BPAP], has been reported to enhance electrical stimulation of monoamine release. This study examined the effect of (-)-BPAP on reinstatement of methamphetamine-seeking behavior in an animal model of relapse to drug abuse. Rats were trained to i.v. self-administer methamphetamine paired with a light and tone (methamphetamine-associated cues) under a fixed-ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement for 10 days. After extinction session under saline infusions without cues, a reinstatement test under saline infusions was begun. Reinstatement induced by methamphetamine-associated cues or methamphetamine-priming injections was attenuated by repeated administration of (-)-BPAP during the extinction phase. Acute administration of (-)-BPAP on test day dose-dependently attenuated both reinstatements. Acute administration of (-)-BPAP neither reinstated methamphetamine-seeking behavior alone nor affected methamphetamine self-administration. Pretreatment with either R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SCH-23390), a dopamine D(1)-like receptor antagonist, or amisulpride, a dopamine D(2)-like receptor antagonist, did not appreciably affected the acute effect of (-)-BPAP on both reinstatements. Co-pretreatment with the dopamine receptor antagonists failed to alter the effects of (-)-BPAP. Meanwhile, pretreatment with a dopamine D(1)-like receptor agonist, (+/-)-6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-l-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrobromide (SKF-81297), dose-dependently attenuated reinstatement induced by the cues or methamphetamine-priming injections. In contrast to (-)-BPAP, pretreatment with SCH-23390 reversed the effects of SKF-81297. Our findings suggest activation of dopamine D(1)-like receptors results in attenuation of the reinstatement of methamphetamine-seeking behavior. Additionally, our findings provide evidence to develop (-)-BPAP and dopamine D(1)-like receptor agonists as an anti-relapse medication for methamphetamine abusers.
The purpose of this study was to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of neuronal death after focal cerebral ischemia and the neuroprotective effects of tamoxifen (TMX). The phosphorylation state of 31 protein kinases/signaling proteins and superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) production in the contralateral and ipsilateral cortex was measured after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in ovariectomized rats treated with placebo or TMX. The study revealed that pMCAO modulated the phosphorylation of a number of kinases/proteins in the penumbra at 2 h after pMCAO. Of significant interest, phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) was elevated significantly after pMCAO. TMX attenuated the elevation of pERK1/2, an effect correlated with reduced infarct size. In situ detection of O(2)(-) production showed a significant elevation at 1-2 h after pMCAO in the ischemic cortex with enhanced oxidative damage detected at 24 h. ERK activation may be downstream of free radicals, a suggestion supported by the findings that cells positive for O(2)(-) had high pERK activation and that a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, tempol, significantly attenuated pERK activation after MCAO. TMX treatment significantly reduced the MCAO-induced elevation of O(2)(-) production, oxidative damage, and proapoptotic caspase-3 activation. Additionally, pMCAO induced a significant reduction in the levels of manganese SOD (MnSOD), which scavenge O(2)(-), an effect largely prevented by TMX treatment, thus providing a potential mechanistic basis for the antioxidant effects of TMX. As a whole, these studies suggest that TMX neuroprotection may be achieved via an antioxidant mechanism that involves enhancement of primarily MnSOD levels, with a corresponding reduction of O(2)(-) production, and downstream kinase and caspase-3 activation.
To describe the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) characteristics in patients suffering vigabatrin-associated visual field loss or behaviour consistent with field loss.
Eight patients with visual field loss attributed to vigabatrin use had their RNFL evaluated by scanning laser polarimetry.
All eight patients managed to perform the test reliably. The mean length of vigabatrin treatment was 81 months with a mean cumulative dose of vigabatrin being 5.4 kg. All patients had significantly reduced RNFL parameters; mean TSNIT=36.5 microm, mean nerve fibre indicator=63.1, mean superior average=42.7 microm, and mean inferior average=39.2 microm. There was no correlation between cumulative dose or time on treatment and RNFL thickness.
Scanning laser polarimetry can be performed safely and reliably on patients with vigabatrin-associated field loss. RNFL thickness is reduced in these patients with vigabatrin-associated field loss. RNFL loss concentrates on the long nerve fibres, which explains the nasal pattern of field loss seen in these patients. This investigation shows promise in the screening of vigabatrin patients, especially in those patients that may not tolerate formal field testing well.
Punarnavine, a quinolizidine alkaloid isolated from Boerhaavia diffusa is known to possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory, hepato-protective, immunomodulatory and anti-proliferative properties. However, its roles in tumor angiogenesis and the involved molecular mechanism are still unknown. Therefore, we examined its anti-angiogenic effects and mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. We examined the effect of punarnavine on VEGF-A expression by RT-PCR, Western blotting and ELISA. In vivo antiangiogenic activity was determined using sponge implant angiogenesis assay and antitumor activity was evaluated against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma tumor. Punarnavine significantly inhibited endothelial cell migration and invasion and capillary structure formation of HUVECs. Punarnavine significantly at 50 μM inhibited MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in HUVECs in vitro. Punarnavine inhibited neovascularization in sponge implant assay. Punarnavine (15 mg/kg bw/d) treatment showed dose-dependent decrease in the ascitic fluid volume by 60.94% and tumor volume by 86.40% in Ehrlich ascites model. Reduction in peritoneal angiogenesis with punarnavine treatment suggests the anti-angiogenic activity of punarnavine. The present study sheds light on the potent anti-angiogenic of the punarnavine and can be extended further to develop therapeutic protocols for treatment of cancer.
Vincristine is a commonly used antineoplastic drug and frequently causes neurotoxicity. Here the authors report a 4-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in whom vincristine-induced peripheral and cranial neuropathy developed during remission induction therapy. The patient seemed to benefit from pyridoxine and pyridostigmine therapy greatly and this therapy is recommended in patients with severe vincristine-induced neuropathy.
To compare the safety and estimate the response profile of olanzapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, to haloperidol in the treatment of delirium in the critical care setting.
Prospective randomized trial.
Tertiary care university affiliated critical care unit.
All admissions to a medical and surgical intensive care unit with a diagnosis of delirium.
Patients were randomized to receive either enteral olanzapine or haloperidol.
Patient's delirium severity and benzodiazepine use were monitored over 5 days after the diagnosis of delirium.
Delirium Index decreased over time in both groups, as did the administered dose of benzodiazepines. Clinical improvement was similar in both treatment arms. No side effects were noted in the olanzapine group, whereas the use of haloperidol was associated with extrapyramidal side effects.
Olanzapine is a safe alternative to haloperidol in delirious critical care patients, and may be of particular interest in patients in whom haloperidol is contraindicated.
Three sex and age matched groups of medical personnel, 20-40 individuals in each, received a course of hepatitis B vaccine: in one group the first dose of vaccine was given a month after injection of hepatitis B immune globulin; in the second, vaccine and immune globulin were given simultaneously; and, in the third, vaccine was given alone. The passively acquired antibody did not interfere with an active immune response to the vaccine. Both the timing of antibody appearance and the antibody titres were similar in the three groups, and the actively acquired antibody persisted for the 8 months of follow-up. Administration of the vaccine together with hepatitis B immune globulin will provide immediate protection, whereas people who receive vaccine alone may lack antibody for several months. This opens new possibilities for post-exposure prophylaxis.
The treatment of acquired cobalamin deficiency in infants may result in the development of a syndrome defined by temporary involuntary myoclonic movements. A patient with an inborn error of metabolism resulting in transcobalamin 2 deficiency who was treated with cobalamin and then developed this syndrome is presented. Neurologic investigations were normal. The continuance of cobalamin and avoidance of antiepileptic drugs is recommended. To our knowledge this is the first such case.
We have conducted a Phase II trial in patients with metastatic gastric cancer utilizing low-dose continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and weekly cisplatin (CDDP). The 5FU was administered at a dose of 200 mg/m2 per day by 24-hour continuous infusion via a permanent central venous catheter. The CDDP was administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2/week for the first 8 weeks, then every other week thereafter. Patients were evaluated for response every 8 weeks. There were 2 complete and 2 partial responses out of 39 eligible and evaluable patients for an overall response rate of 10% (95% CI = 3-24%). The primary toxicities were nausea, hyponatremia, and anemia. Overall, treatment was well tolerated. We conclude that, although the treatment is relatively well tolerated, the regimen has minimal activity in this disease and does not deserve further study.
To investigate the relationship between the availability of paracetamol and its use for overdose and suicide.
Analysis of routinely collected information on time trends for paracetamol suicides, non-fatal overdoses, and sales.
England and Wales and France.
There were strong correlations between trends in paracetamol sales in the UK and trends in non-fatal paracetamol overdose in Oxford between 1976 and 1993 (Spearman's r = 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54, 0.96) and between paracetamol sales and non-fatal overdoses in France between 1974 and 1990 (r = 0.99; 95% CI 0.97, 1.00). Sales figures were also correlated with paracetamol related suicides in both England and Wales, 1983-91 (r = 0.72; 95% CI 0.11, 0.94) and France, 1974-90 (r = 0.79; 95% CI 0.50, 0.92). Similarly strong relationships were observed between trends in non-fatal overdoses and suicide by paracetamol poisoning in England and Wales (r = 0.85; 95% CI 0.61, 0.95) and France (r = 0.79; 95% CI 0.50, 0.92). It is estimated that approximately 32,000 overdoses involving paracetamol occur annually in England and Wales. Fatality rates from paracetamol overdose were four times as high in England and Wales (0.4%, 95% CI 0.38, 0.46) as in France (0.1%, 95% CI 0.06, 0.17).
Trends towards greater availability of paracetamol are paralleled by increases in its use for both non-fatal overdose and suicide. Paracetamol related morbidity and mortality seem to be less frequent in France where the quantity of paracetamol in a single purchase is limited. Although not conclusive, these data add to a body of evidence which suggests that restrictions in the quantity of paracetamol available as a single purchase in the UK may reduce suicide and liver failure related to paracetamol.
The effect of Punarnavine on the immune system was studied using Balb/c mice. Intraperitoneal administration of Punarnavine (40 mg/kg body weight) was found to enhance the total WBC count on 6(th) day. Bone marrow cellularity and number of alpha-esterase positive cells were also increased by the administration of Punarnavine. Treatment of Punarnavine along with the antigen, sheep red blood cells (SRBC), produced an enhancement in the circulating antibody titer and the number of plaque forming cells (PFC) in the spleen. Maximum number of PFC was obtained on the 6(th) day. Punarnavine also showed enhanced proliferation of splenocytes, thymocytes and bone marrow cells both in the presence and absence of specific mitogens in vitro and in vivo. More over administration of Punarnavine significantly reduced the LPS induced elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in mice. These results indicate the immunomodulatory activity of Punarnavine.
Low-molecular-weight heparins, such as enoxaparin, are increasingly being used for treatment of venous thromboembolism. We describe two patients who received therapeutic enoxaparin for several months. Although their serum creatinine values were normal, both had mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 60-70 ml/min), and both accumulated the drug abnormally and experienced clinical bleeding. These results suggest that patients receiving enoxaparin (or other low-molecular-weight heparins) in therapeutic doses for periods of more than 4 weeks should be considered for laboratory monitoring to avoid bleeding.
Eight of 35 patients with cancer receiving COL-3, a tetracycline derivative with antiangiogenic properties, developed anemia while on treatment. All of these patients were enrolled on an approved Phase I clinical trial at the National Cancer Institute. Three of these patients had bone marrow examinations that revealed ringed sideroblasts. This paper describes these cases. Am. J. Hematol. 67:51-53, 2001. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study involving 60 subjects, aged 6-18 years old, was conducted over a period of 3 months to determine the effect of Pycnogenol (a proprietary mixture of water-soluble bioflavonoids extracted from French maritime pine) on mild-to-moderate asthma. After baseline evaluation, subjects were randomized into two groups to receive either Pycnogenol or placebo. Subjects were instructed to record their peak expiratory flow with an Assess Peak Flow Meter each evening. At the same time, symptoms, daily use of rescue inhalers (albuterol), and any changes in oral medications were also recorded. Urine samples were obtained from the subjects at the end of the run-in period, and at 1-, 2-, and 3-month visits. Urinary leukotriene C4/D4/E4 was measured by an enzyme immunoassay. Compared with subjects taking placebo, the group who took Pycnogenol had significantly more improvement in pulmonary functions and asthma symptoms. The Pycnogenol group was able to reduce or discontinue their use of rescue inhalers more often than the placebo group. There was also a significant reduction of urinary leukotrienes in the Pycnogenol group. The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of Pycnogenol as an adjunct in the management of mild-to-moderate childhood asthma.
Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 7 is a novel tumor suppressor gene that induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells when delivered by adenoviral gene transfer as Ad-mda7. The mechanisms of action are not well defined but may involve release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria with subsequent caspase activation.
The lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 were transduced with Ad-mda7, adenovirus containing the gene for p53 (Ad-p53), and control adenoviral luciferase vectors. Staurosporine was used as a positive control to induce cytochrome c release through mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent pores, whereas cyclosporine (INN: ciclosporin) was used to specifically inhibit these mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent pores. Apoptosis was evaluated with fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of subdiploid populations and mitochondrial membrane potential changes with tetramethylrhodamine ethylester perchlorate.
Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 7, transduced by Ad-mda7 into H1299 and A549 lung cancer cells, resulted in sharp increases in cytosolic cytochrome c levels followed by induction of apoptosis and cellular death. The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria occurred without changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Unlike staurosporine treatment, transduction with Ad-p53 and Ad-mda7 caused releases of cytochrome c and apoptosis that were not blocked by cyclosporine, suggesting a mitochondrial permeability transition pore-independent pathway.
Ad-mda7 induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells through mitochondrial cytochrome c release in a process that is not dependent on mitochondrial membrane potential changes and occurs through mitochondrial permeability transition-independent pores. This unique mechanism of action may allow treatment of patients with lung cancer resistant to mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent cell death processes.
The impact of cancer and its treatments on balance and functional mobility in older adults remains unknown but is increasingly important, given the evolution of cancer treatments. Subacute and more persistent side effects such as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy are on the rise, and the effects on mobility and balance, as well as the prognosis for resolution of any functional deficits, must be established before interventions can be trialed. The purpose of this case report is to describe the severity and long-term persistence of mobility decline in an older adult who received neurotoxic chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe an older adult with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy using results of standardized balance and mobility tests and to focus on prognosis by repeating these measures more than 2 years after chemotherapy.
An 81-year-old woman received a neurotoxic agent (paclitaxel) after curative mastectomy for breast cancer. Baseline testing prior to taxane therapy revealed a socially active woman with no reported functional deficits or neuropathic symptoms, 1.2-m/s gait speed, and performance at the ceiling on balance and gait portions of a standardized mobility measure.
After 3 cycles, paclitaxel therapy was stopped by the oncologist because of neurotoxicity. Declines as large as 50% were seen in performance-based measures at 12 weeks and persisted at 2.5 years, and the patient reported recurrent falls, cane use, and mobility-related disability.
This case highlights the extent to which function can decline in an older individual receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy, the potential for these deficits to persist years after treatment is stopped, and the need for physical therapy intervention and further research in this population.
We evaluated the effects of brucine on N-nitrosodiethylamine (DENA)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. Initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis was done by intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) followed by promotion with phenobarbital. The rats were exposed to dietary brucine for 4 weeks prior to initiation, and the treatment was continued for 22 consecutive weeks. Brucine decreased the incidence, total number, multiplicity, size and volume of preneoplastic hepatic nodules in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of DENA induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as evidenced by changes in histopathological architecture, increased activity of cytochrome P450, decreased activity of glutathione Stransferase (GST) as well as decreased antioxidant status, enhanced lipid peroxidation, increased liver marker enzymes. Western blot analysis showed decreased expression of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 with activation of caspase-3 and increased expression of Bax. Immunohistochemical demonstrated the decreased expression of the PCNA and VEGF. These results indicate that brucine prevents lipid peroxidation and hepatic cell damage and also protects the antioxidant system in DENA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
In this study we aimed to validate the prognostic value of DC-SCRIPT mRNA expression in a large independent breast cancer cohort. In addition, since DC-SCRIPT is a transcriptional co-regulator of nuclear receptors, we explored its prognostic value in relation to estrogen-receptor-α (ESR1) and -β (ESR2) and evaluated its predictive value for response to tamoxifen treatment.
DC-SCRIPT mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR in 1,505 primary invasive breast cancers and associated with outcome (disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS)) using univariate and multivariable Cox regression analysis. Logistic and Cox regressions were used to associate DC-SCRIPT levels with clinical benefit and progression-free survival (PFS) for 296 patients treated with first-line systemic tamoxifen for advanced disease.
In univariate and multivariable analysis higher DC-SCRIPT levels were associated with a favorable outcome for both the entire cohort and patients with lymph node-negative (LNN) disease that did not receive adjuvant therapy (DFS, MFS and OS; all, P < 0.001). This association was most pronounced in small (pT1) tumors, in ESR1-positive tumors and in tumors with low ESR2 expression. For first-line endocrine therapy for advanced disease no predictive association was seen with clinical benefit or PFS.
This study provides a higher level of evidence that DC-SCRIPT is indeed an independent, pure prognostic, factor for primary breast cancer and shows that DC-SCRIPT mRNA expression is most informative for either ESR1-positive and/or ESR2-low pT1 tumors.
The present investigation was designed to identify potential biomarker(s) and assess the involvement of inflammatory pathway in dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Following DMN-treatment (10 mg/ml/kg, i.p., given three consecutive days each week for 4 weeks) body and liver weights were significantly decreased concurrent with increasing severity of liver damage assessed by bridging fibrosis, a histopathologic assessment and characteristic of human liver disease. Protein C along with albumin, C-reactive-protein (CRP), haptoglobin and total protein were significantly reduced and correlated with changes in liver histopathology. Biochemical markers of liver functions were significantly increased and correlated with changes in liver histopathology and plasma levels of protein C. Soluble intracellular-adhesion-molecule-1 (sICAM-1) levels were increased significantly but were poorly correlated with histopathology and protein C levels. Inflammatory chemokines and other analytes, monocyte-chemoattractant-protein-1 and 3 (MCP-1 and MCP-3), macrophage-colony-stimulating-factor (M-CSF) were significantly increased during the disease progression, whereas macrophage-derived-chemokine (MDC) and CRP were significantly suppressed. Circulating neutrophils and monocytes were also increased along with disease progression. The differential changes in sICAM-1, hyaluronic acid, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), neutrophil and other inflammatory chemokines suggest the involvement of inflammatory pathways in DMN-induced liver fibrosis. In conclusion, the progressive changes in protein C along with other noninvasive biochemical parameters whose levels were significantly correlated with disease progression may serve as biomarkers for pharmacological assessment of targeted therapy for liver fibrosis.
To investigate the anti-ischemic capability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, 10 patients with acute myocardial ischemia (angina pectoris less than 1 h, ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV, no rise in creatine phosphokinase) received 25 mg captopril sublingually after being treated with an intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin (3 mg/h) and heparin (1200 IU/h) for 1 hour. A control group of 10 patients received placebo instead of captopril. Results showed a decrease of the initial ST-segment depression from 0.25 +/- 0.04 to 0.2 +/- 0.03 mV (p less than 0.01) with nitroglycerin for the captopril group and from 0.26 +/- 0.05 to 0.21 +/- 0.05 mV (p less than 0.01) for the control group. An additional decrease to 0.13 +/- 0.03 mV (p less than 0.001) was measured after sublingual captopril, while no significant change was found in the placebo group (0.19 +/- 0.04 mV). In both groups, 3 patients had no incidents of angina after 1-h nitroglycerin infusion. An additional 6 patients resolved their complaints after captopril administration in contrast to only 1 after placebo. Two patients in the placebo group required increased doses of nitroglycerin because of impairment of anginal complaints. Hemodynamic measurements documented a significant drop of pulmonary vascular resistance after a 1-h infusion of nitroglycerin (-12.9% and -13.1%, respectively, p less than 0.05), while all other parameters remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Baseline and follow-up qualitative interviews with methamphetamine users in rural Kentucky and Arkansas examined their involvement in drug-related violence. Twelve baseline participants reported methamphetamine-related violence, whereas 20 reported violence linked to other substances. In follow-up interviews conducted 12 to 24 months later, four participants reported methamphetamine-related violence and three reported violence associated with other substances. Violence was rarely directly attributed to methamphetamine's psychoactive effects. Rather, violence was associated with disputes over methamphetamine or its use, paranoia, ill-tempers, and hallucinations during methamphetamine "binges." Implications of the findings for additional research and interventions are discussed.
