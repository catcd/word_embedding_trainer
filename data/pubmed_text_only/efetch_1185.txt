The authors explored the binge eating symptomatology in 74 patients receiving clozapine (N = 57) or olanzapine (N = 17), and compared body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) and weight gain in patients with and without binge eating symptomatology. Subjects who screened positively for binge eating were interviewed using a modified version of the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns (QEWP). Current BMIs were assessed cross-sectionally, BMIs at initiation of clozapine/olanzapine treatment retrospectively. Thirty-seven subjects (50%) screened positively. Taking clozapine and olanzapine together, 6/27 (22.2%) females and 3/47 (6.4%) males fulfilled criteria for binge eating disorder, 3/27 (11.1%) females and 2/47 (4.3%) males for bulimia nervosa. Patients who screened positively showed higher current BMIs (26.8 +/- 3.9 vs. 24.7 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2)) and higher BMI increments during clozapine/olanzapine treatment (3.9 +/- 3.1 vs. 2.6 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2)) than patients who screened negatively. We conclude that clozapine/olanzapine may induce binge eating and full blown eating disorders which may have predictive value for weight gain. For future research in this field we suggest a novel DSM-IV research classification "Medication-induced eating disorders".
The selective mGlu5 antagonists, MPEP, 2-methyl-6-phenylethynyl-pyridine, and SIB1893, (E)-6-methyl-2-styryl-pyridine, have been evaluated as antiepileptic drugs in DBA/2 mice and lethargic mice. Clonic seizures induced by the selective mGlu5 agonist, (R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG), 3 micromol intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), are potently suppressed by both compounds (MPEP, ED(50)=0.42 [0.28-0.62] mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.); SIB 1893 ED(50)=0.19 [0.11-0.33] mg/kg i.p. ). Clonic seizures induced by the mGlu1,5 agonist, 3, 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), 1.5 micromol i.c.v., are less potently suppressed by both compounds (MPEP, ED(50)=22 [13-38] mg/kg i.p., 110 [67-180] nmol i.c.v.; SIB1893, ED(50)=31 [18-54] mg/kg i.p. , 95 [82-110] nmol i.c.v.). Sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice are suppressed at 15 min by MPEP and SIB 1893 (MPEP ED(50) clonic seizures=18 [10-32] mg/kg i.p., 93 [69-125] nmol i.c.v.; tonic seizures=6.1 [4.5-8.3] mg/kg i.p., 46 [26-80] nmol i.c.v.; SIB 1893 ED(50) clonic seizures=27 [17-44] mg/kg i.p., 825 [615-1108] nmol i. c.v., tonic seizures=5.4 [3.4-8.6] mg/kg i.p., 194 [113-332] nmol i. c.v.). The ED(50) for MPEP for impaired rotarod performance is 128 [83-193] mg/kg i.p., at 15 min, i.e. a therapeutic index for sound-induced seizures of 5-20. In lethargic mice (lh/lh), a genetic absence model, MPEP, 50 mg/kg i.p., caused a marked reduction in the incidence of spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges. These selective antagonists of mGlu5 block seizures due to activation of mGlu5 at very low systemic doses. At rather higher doses they block convulsive and non-convulsive primary generalised seizures.
Recent studies indicate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critically involved in persistent pain primarily through spinal mechanisms, thus suggesting ROS involvement in central sensitization. To investigate ROS involvement in central sensitization, the effects of ROS scavengers and donors on pain behaviors were examined in mice. Capsaicin- induced hyperalgesia was used as a pain model since it has 2 distinctive pain components, primary and secondary hyperalgesia representing peripheral and central sensitization, respectively. Capsaicin (25 microg/5 microl) was injected intradermally into the left hind foot. Foot withdrawal frequencies in response to von Frey filament stimuli were measured and used as an indicator of mechanical hyperalgesia. The production of ROS was examined by using a ROS sensitive dye, MitoSox. Mice developed primary and secondary mechanical hyperalgesia after capsaicin injection. A systemic or intrathecal post-treatment with either phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) or 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1 oxyl (TEMPOL), ROS scavengers, significantly reduced secondary hyperalgesia, but not primary hyperalgesia, in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with ROS scavengers also significantly reduced the magnitude and duration of capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. On the other hand, intrathecal injection of tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH, 5 microl), a ROS donor, produced a transient hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner. The number of MitoSox positive dorsal horn neurons was increased significantly after capsaicin treatment. This study suggests that ROS mediates the development and maintenance of capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in mice, mainly through central sensitization and that the elevation of spinal ROS is most likely due to increased production of mitochondrial superoxides in the dorsal horn neurons.
A 30-year-old man who presented with delayed puberty and infertility was found to have hypogonadism associated with an absence of circulating luteinizing hormone. The patient had a homozygous missense mutation in the gene that encodes the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone (Gly36Asp), a mutation that disrupted a vital cystine knot motif and abrogated the heterodimerization and secretion of luteinizing hormone. Treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin increased circulating testosterone, promoted virilization, and was associated with the appearance of normal spermatozoa in low concentrations. This case illustrates the important physiological role that luteinizing hormone plays in male sexual maturation and fertility.
To determine whether adding ephedrine to propofol is as effective as adding lidocaine at reducing injection pain, and its effects on hemodynamics.
Randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial.
District general hospital in the United Kingdom.
156 adult, ASA physical status I, II, and III patients undergoing elective or emergency general anesthesia.
Patients were randomized to one of three groups to receive one mL of 1% lidocaine per 20 mL of 1% propofol (Group L), 15 mg of ephedrine per 20 mL of propofol (Group E15), or 30 mg of ephedrine per 20 mL of propofol (Group E30).
Pain on injection, heart rate, and blood pressure at one-minute intervals for ten minutes were recorded. There was no significant difference in injection pain among groups. Group E30 had the least amount of hemodynamic change.
Adding 30 mg of ephedrine to 20 mL of 1% propofol is as effective as adding lidocaine in preventing injection pain, and it results in a more stable hemodynamic profile.
To observe the effects of simvastatin on urinary excretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP- 9), renal expression of MMP-9, and investigate its possible renoprotective mechanisms in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.
Twenty-four Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: control healthy rats (group C, no.=8), untreated diabetic rats (group D, no.=8), and diabetic rats treated with simvastatin (20 mg/kg/d) (group S, no.=8). Peripheral blood glucose was tested weekly, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and urinary albumin (ALB) excretion rate as well as the urinary excretion rates of retinol-binding protein (RBP) and MMP-9 were tested at 8th week. The renal tissues of diabetic rats were obtained for evaluating kidney/ body weight ratio, observing renal pathological changes by electron microscope and examining the expression of renal MMP-9 mRNA by RT-PCR.
There was no statistical difference on the change of peripheral blood TC and LDL-C between group C and group D. Peripheral blood glucose, HbA1c levels kidney/body weight ratio urinary excretion rates of ALB, RBP, and MMP-9 concurrently with the expression of renal MMP-9 mRNA were significantly higher in groups D and S compared with group C (p<0.01). Treatment with simvastatin significantly lowered peripheral blood TC, LDL-C, kidney/body weight ratio, urinary excretion rates of ALB, RBP, and MMP-9 as well as the expression of renal MMP-9 mRNA (p<0.01); however, there was no evident effect on the change of blood glucose and HbA1c levels between group D and group S. In addition, urinary excretion rate of MMP-9 showed positive correlations with the urinary ALB excretion and urinary RBP excretion. Pathological lesions of the glomeruli and epithelial cells foot processes (FP) was lightened by simvastatin.
Simvastatin may has a potential therapeutic target in diabetic nephropathy, which may be partly attributed to down-regulating over-expression of MMP-9 in renal tissue.
Through exomic sequencing of ten hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and subsequent evaluation of additional affected individuals, we discovered novel inactivating mutations of ARID2 in four major subtypes of HCC (HCV-associated HCC, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC, alcohol-associated HCC and HCC with no known etiology). Notably, 18.2% of individuals with HCV-associated HCC in the United States and Europe harbored ARID2 inactivation mutations, suggesting that ARID2 is a tumor suppressor gene that is relatively commonly mutated in this tumor subtype.
The effects of diphenylhydantoin [phenytoin (PHT)] on both the acute withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and the asthenic-autonomic syndrome associated with chronic alcoholism were evaluated in a single-blind, controlled, clinical, and comprehensive multiparameter psychophysiological and neurophysiological study. Twenty-four patients were treated with PHT (100 mg, PO, tid) and our standard detoxification therapy (intravenous fluids and vitamins as an antihistamine and a vasodilator; cognitive psychotherapy; and occupational therapy) and their progress was compared to that of 12 patients receiving only our standard detoxification therapy. The use of PHT and standard detoxification therapy resulted in an amelioration or cessation of the main symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal within a mean of 3 +/- 1 days. Vital fear, psychomotor excitation, sense of shortness of breath, pronounced chill-like state, and pronounced perspiration disappeared within 3 days. In the control group, the same improvements were found in a mean of 11 +/- 3 days. After the acute withdrawal period, PHT (50-100 mg, bid-tid) was continued in all 24 patients of the PHT group to evaluate its effects on the asthenic-autonomic syndrome. PHT's most marked therapeutic effects (improvements in mood, aggression, ability to react appropriately to surroundings, attention, active vigilance, and autonomic parameters) were seen in eight patients with the sympathetic-adrenal type of autonomic disorders. Dynamic EEG and infraslow physiological processes showed confirmatory improvement. A reduction in alcohol craving and longer alcohol-free remission times were also seen. Although there were some benefits in the 16 patients with the parasympathetic type of autonomic disorders, they were smaller and less stable. There were no beneficial effects of PHT or standard therapy in a group of five young patients with a malignant, rapidly progressive form of alcoholism. We conclude that PHT is useful in acute alcohol withdrawal and in the treatment of the asthenic-autonomic syndrome (during the rehabilitative phase) in patients with sympathetic type of autonomic disorder. Further clinical evaluation and use of PHT in alcohol withdrawal and rehabilitation are indicated.
This study was designed to evaluate the penicillin-induced epilepsy model in terms of dose-response relationship of penicillin used to induce epilepsy seizure on hippocampal neuron number and hippocampal volume in Sprague-Dawley rats. Seizures were induced with 300, 500, 1500 and 2000IU of penicillin-G injected intracortically in rats divided in four experimental groups, respectively. Control group was injected intracortically with saline. Animals were decapitated on day 7 of treatment and brains were removed. The total neuron number of pyramidal cell layer from rat hippocampus was estimated using the optical fractionator method. The volume of same hippocampal areas was estimated using the Cavalieri method. Dose-dependent decrease in hippocampal neuron number was observed in three experimental groups (300, 500 and 1500IU of penicillin-G), and the effects were statistically significant when compared to the control group (P<0.009). Dose-dependent decrease in hippocampal volume, on the other hand, was observed in all three of these groups; however, the difference compared to the control group was only statistically significant in 1500IU of penicillin-G injected group (P<0.009). At the dose of 2000IU penicillin-G, all animals died due to status seizures. These results suggest that the appropriate dose of penicillin has to be selected for a given experimental epilepsy study in order to demonstrate the relevant epileptic seizure and its effects. Intracortical 1500IU penicillin-induced epilepsy model may be a good choice to practice studies that investigate neuroprotective mechanisms of the anti-epileptic drugs.
Acatalasemia, a deficiency of enzyme catalase, is an autosomal recessive syndrome with an incidence of 5:106 in Hungary. We have examined the first Hungarian acatalasemic family for the disease-causing mutation. All exons of the catalase gene were screened by PCR-SSCP, PCR-heteroduplex, and nucleotide sequence analysis. The heteroduplex formation detected in exon 2 was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. We found a GA insertion at nucleotide position 138, increasing the GA repeat number from 4 to 5. This GA insertion caused a frameshift in the amino acid sequence from position 68 to 133 and generated a TGA terminating codon at amino acid position 134. This truncated protein lacks the essential amino acid (histidine 74) in the active center. This finding can explain the decreased blood catalase activity in the Hungarian acatalasemic family.
Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is the most common type of bladder cancer. Here we sequenced the exomes of nine individuals with TCC and screened all the somatically mutated genes in a prevalence set of 88 additional individuals with TCC with different tumor stages and grades. In our study, we discovered a variety of genes previously unknown to be mutated in TCC. Notably, we identified genetic aberrations of the chromatin remodeling genes (UTX, MLL-MLL3, CREBBP-EP300, NCOR1, ARID1A and CHD6) in 59% of our 97 subjects with TCC. Of these genes, we showed UTX to be altered substantially more frequently in tumors of low stages and grades, highlighting its potential role in the classification and diagnosis of bladder cancer. Our results provide an overview of the genetic basis of TCC and suggest that aberration of chromatin regulation might be a hallmark of bladder cancer.
Recently, RAD51C mutations were identified in families with breast and ovarian cancer. This observation prompted us to investigate the role of RAD51D in cancer susceptibility. We identified eight inactivating RAD51D mutations in unrelated individuals from 911 breast-ovarian cancer families compared with one inactivating mutation identified in 1,060 controls (P = 0.01). The association found here was principally with ovarian cancer, with three mutations identified in the 59 pedigrees with three or more individuals with ovarian cancer (P = 0.0005). The relative risk of ovarian cancer for RAD51D mutation carriers was estimated to be 6.30 (95% CI 2.86-13.85, P = 4.8 × 10(-6)). By contrast, we estimated the relative risk of breast cancer to be 1.32 (95% CI 0.59-2.96, P = 0.50). These data indicate that RAD51D mutation testing may have clinical utility in individuals with ovarian cancer and their families. Moreover, we show that cells deficient in RAD51D are sensitive to treatment with a PARP inhibitor, suggesting a possible therapeutic approach for cancers arising in RAD51D mutation carriers.
Despite its high heritability, a large fraction of individuals with schizophrenia do not have a family history of the disease (sporadic cases). Here we examined the possibility that rare de novo protein-altering mutations contribute to the genetic component of schizophrenia by sequencing the exomes of 53 sporadic cases, 22 unaffected controls and their parents. We identified 40 de novo mutations in 27 cases affecting 40 genes, including a potentially disruptive mutation in DGCR2, a gene located in the schizophrenia-predisposing 22q11.2 microdeletion region. A comparison to rare inherited variants indicated that the identified de novo mutations show a large excess of non-synonymous changes in schizophrenia cases, as well as a greater potential to affect protein structure and function. Our analyses suggest a major role for de novo mutations in schizophrenia as well as a large mutational target, which together provide a plausible explanation for the high global incidence and persistence of the disease.
It is well known that triglycerides and cholesterol are often increased in gout. In 50% of the patients with hyperuricemia and in 40% of the patients with gout hyperlipidemia is found. K. Kŭnev has found in his former studies that the treatment with the drug Desuric leads to a decrease of cholesterol and other lipids in the blood. The follow up of 38 men with proved gout, mean age 45 years and mean duration of the disease 5 years, established an increase mainly of endogenous triglycerides and cholesterol. Benzbromarone treatment, 50-100 mg daily, led to a parallel decrease of serum lipids and uric acid. This allows benzbromarone to be recommended for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in gout which will lead to a decrease of the vascular complications and mortality in gout.
In order to investigate myocardial lipid metabolism in patients receiving chemotherapy regimens containing adriamycin (ADR) for hematological malignancies, 123I-beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) myocardial SPECT was performed. Thirty-two patients with hematological malignancies received a mean total ADR dose of 245 mg/m2 (range: 0-550 mg/m2). A polar map based on data from 8 normal individuals was used to calculate the extent score (representing the area of decreased uptake) and the severity score (representing the severity of defects) in the patients given ADR. 1) There was a significant association between the total ADR dose and the extent and severity scores. 2) The left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly associated with the extent and severity scores. 3) The two scores were also significantly associated with the washout rate of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). These results suggest that 123I-BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy reflects dysfunction of the myocardial mitochondria and serves as a guide for determining whether administration of ADR should be discontinued or the dose reduced.
Two recently published meta-analyses of controlled trials of a wide variety of progestational agents, used in pregnancy (Daya 1989; Goldstein et al. 1989), prompted this third meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials involving the prophylactic use of a single agent, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Of seven relevant published reports of controlled trials, six had involved women considered to be a high risk of miscarriage or preterm birth. This analysis provides no support for the view that 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate protects against miscarriage, but suggests that it does reduce the occurrence of preterm birth. The latter effect was reflected in a reduced rate of low birthweight babies, but not in a statistically significant reduction in perinatal mortality and morbidity. The difference between this meta-analysis and the two earlier meta-analyses illustrates the problems both of selective sub-grouping and of comprehensive pooling of data from small trials.
Intravenous (IV) racemic sotalol is useful for the treatment of multiple tachydysrhythmias. The authors hypothesized that the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP) in patients treated with a single IV infusion of sotalol is lower than the 2-4% risk associated with chronic oral sotalol therapy.
A MEDLINE search under the subject heading "sotalol" was made of all publications involving humans written in English or German from 1966 to October 1, 2000. A meta-analysis of all original reports including patients who were given a single infusion of at least 1.5 mg/kg or 100 mg of IV sotalol over 30 minutes or less was performed. Potential variables predictive of TdP were assessed. The primary outcome was the observation of TdP associated with IV sotalol infusion. Secondary measurements included hypotension, bradycardia, and worsening of congestive heart failure. All excluded studies and case reports were also examined for evidence of TdP associated with IV sotalol treatment.
The search included 1,005 publications. There were 37 reports in which 962 patients received IV sotalol and met the inclusion criteria. There was one report of self-terminating TdP lasting 10 seconds among the 962 patients included in the study. There was no report of TdP associated with only IV racemic sotalol administration in any of the excluded studies. If it is assumed that the risk of TdP is homogeneous in the population of patients treated with IV sotalol, then based on the 962 included patients, the rate of TdP is 0.1% (95% CI = 0.003% to 0.6%).
The overall risk of TdP in patients treated with a single infusion of IV sotalol is low compared with that in patients given chronic oral sotalol therapy.
The present study investigated the in vitro and in vivo growth-inhibitory effects of combination therapy with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and an adenovirus expressing promyelocytic leukemia protein (Ad-PML). Growth of HepG2 cells in culture was not inhibited by As2O3 at concentrations below 5 micromol/L (p > 0.05). However, growth was inhibited by Ad-PML alone and synergistic growth inhibition was observed following combined treatments (p < 0.05). Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated an increase in apoptosis following combined treatment with As2O3 and Ad-PML for 24 h, which was correlated with increased p53 and decreased Bcl-2 expression. To examine treatment effects on in vivo cell growth, control HepG2 cells and cells treated with As2O3, Ad-PML, or both therapies were subcutaneously injected in nude mice. After 6 weeks, tumor volumes were 0.097 +/- 0.031 and 0.083 +/- 0.005 cm3 in the control and As2O3 alone groups, respectively (p > 0.05), but were undetectable in the Ad-PML alone or Ad-PML plus As2O3 groups. Finally, established HepG2 tumors in nude mice were injected with PBS, Ad-PML, As2O3, or Ad-PML plus As2O3, the tumor volumes were measured by ultrasound, and the therapeutic effects were compared. As2O3 alone had no effect at concentrations below 5 micromol/L (p > 0.05), while Ad-PML alone at a multiplicity of infection of 20 or As2O3 plus Ad-PML significantly decreased tumor volumes (p < 0.05). Thus, the combination of As2O3 and Ad-PML has synergistic inhibitory effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), possibly resulting from regulation of apoptotic gene expression enhanced HCC apoptosis.
Dextromethorphan, widely used as an antitussive, has recently been shown to protect animals against maximal electroshock and excitatory amino acid (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-induced convulsions. Its protective efficacy against theophylline-induced seizures was determined in this investigation in view of the limited effectiveness of presently available anticonvulsants against this manifestation of serious theophylline intoxication. Rats were pretreated with an oral dose of dextromethorphan (50 mg/kg) or saline solution. Fifteen minutes later, the rats were infused intravenously with theophylline [approximately 11 mg/(kg.min)] until the onset of maximal seizures. Pretreatment with dextromethorphan was associated with a significant decrease in the concentrations of theophylline in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum at the pharmacologic endpoint. To further explore this unanticipated effect, a similar experiment was performed with the convulsant pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), which was infused at a rate of approximately 3.4 mg/(kg.min) until the onset of maximal seizures. Dextromethorphan-pretreated animals required a significantly larger dose of PTZ than did controls to produce the first myoclonic jerk, but a significantly smaller dose of the convulsant to produce maximal seizures. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of PTZ at onset of maximal seizures were significantly lower in dextromethorphan-treated than in control animals. The proconvulsant activity of dextromethorphan with respect to theophylline-induced maximal seizures is similar to that of phenytoin, and is consistent with other pharmacologic evidence of such similarity.
Vitamin E treatment has been found to be beneficial in preventing or reducing diabetic nephropathy. Increased tissue calcium and abnormal microsomal Ca(2+)-ATPase activity have been suggested as contributing factors in the development of diabetic nephropathy. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that vitamin E reduces lipid peroxidation and can prevent the abnormalities in microsomal Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and calcium levels in kidney of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Male rats were rendered diabetic by a single STZ injection (55 mg x kg(-1) i.p.). After diabetes was verified, diabetic and age-matched control rats were untreated or treated with vitamin E (400-500 IU kg(-1) x day(-1), orally) for 10 weeks. Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and lipid peroxidation (MDA) were determined spectrophotometrically. Blood glucose levels increased approximately five-fold (> 500 mg x dl(-1)) in untreated-diabetic rats but decreased to 340+/-27 mg x dl(-1) in the vitamin E treated-diabetic group. Kidney MDA levels did not significantly change in the diabetic state. However, vitamin E treatment markedly inhibited MDA levels in both control and diabetic animals. Ca(2+)-ATPase activity was 0.483+/-0.008 U l(-1) in the control group and significantly increased to 0.754+/-0.010 U l(-1) in the STZ-diabetic group (p < 0.001). Vitamin E treatment completely prevented the diabetes-induced increase in Ca(2+)-ATPase activity (0.307+/-0.025 U l(-1), p < 0.001) and also reduced the enzyme activity in normal control rats. STZ-diabetes resulted in approximately two-fold increase in total calcium content of kidney. Vitamin E treatment led to a significant reduction in kidney calcium levels of both control and diabetic animals (p < 0.001). Thus, vitamin E treatment can lower blood glucose and lipid peroxidation, which in turn prevents the abnormalities in kidney calcium metabolism of diabetic rats. This study describes a potential biochemical mechanism by which vitamin E supplementation may delay or inhibit the development of cellular damage and nephropathy in diabetes.
In spite of possible toxicity streptozotocin now appears to be the best treatment for malignant islet cell tumour with liver metastases, i.e. inoperable tumours with a poor prognosis either due to extension of the tumour itself or due to hypoglycemic attacks. Out of about 60 patients thus treated, 1 to 2 years survival were obtained. 22 out of 52 patients reported by Broder and Carter are still alive and one may estimate the overall percentage of favourable results at 65%. On the other hand out of another 100 patients treated elsewhere with this antineoplastic agent, only a few cases of carcinoid tumour gave encouraging results. The course of the others was not modified significantly.
To investigate the androgen, weak androgen, estrogen, and gonadotrophin response to clomiphene in alcoholics, we determined in 63 male patients (25 with and 38 without liver cirrhosis) serum testosterone, sexual hormone binding protein (SHBG), dehidroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, LH, FSH, prolactin, and estradiol levels, on the first and the sixth day after admission, and after a course of 8 days of clomiphene 200 mg/day. The same test was performed on 15 healthy volunteers. Cirrhotic patients showed decreased basal testosterone levels and a loss of the circadian rhythm with recovery after clomiphene. Although basal testosterone levels in noncirrhotic alcoholics did not differ from those of the controls, there was a significant improvement after withdrawal. SHBG levels were higher in both groups of alcoholics than in controls, pointing to a worse degree of hypogonadism, because only the free hormone is active. Before the clomiphene test, serum LH and FSH levels were nonsignificantly higher in both groups of alcoholics than in the control group. After clomiphene both LH and FSH increased. Androstenedione and estradiol showed a (parallelism) similar behavior in alcoholic and in cirrhotic groups, showing in both cases higher levels than in the control group, and an increase after clomiphene, perhaps reflecting peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens. Because clomiphene has no effect on the adrenal cortex, the increase of androstenedione after clomiphene points to its testicular origin (directly or after testosterone conversion) and not to an adrenal one. The highest serum estradiol levels were observed in cirrhotics with ascites or gynecomastia. We have not found any relation between serum hormone levels and alcohol intake nor with nutritional status.
