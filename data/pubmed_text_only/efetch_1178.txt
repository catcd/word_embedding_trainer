Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive agent that can show a wide variety of neurologic side effects, including leukoencephalopathy. Although the prognosis is good-after cessation or dose reduction, complete recovery usually occurs-the differentiation with treatable diseases such as progressive multifocal encephalopathy can be difficult, making a stereotactic biopsy of the white matter lesion sometimes necessary. We describe the case of a 12-year-old girl with a severe, reversible tacrolimus-related leukoencephalopathy and only mild histopathologic abnormalities.
Rosiglitazone, a synthetic ligand of transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), possesses a blood pressure-lowering effect beyond insulin sensitizing and glucose lowering. Oxidative stress in rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), where sympathetic premotor neurons for the maintenance of neurogenic vasomotor tone are located, contributes to neural mechanisms of hypertension. Activation of PPAR-gamma protects against oxidative stress in RVLM by upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). We tested the hypothesis that oral intake of rosiglitazone exerts a central antihypertensive effect by ameliorating oxidative stress in RVLM via transcriptional upregulation of UCP2 after PPAR-gamma activation. In adult spontaneously hypertensive rats but not normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, oral intake of rosiglitazone for 1 week resulted in vasodepression and a reduction in the vasomotor components of the systemic arterial pressure spectrum, our experimental index for sympathetic vasomotor tone. These antihypertensive effects of rosiglitazone in spontaneously hypertensive rats were abrogated by microinjection bilaterally into RVLM of PPAR-gamma small interfering RNA. Oral intake of rosiglitazone also upregulated UCP2 and ameliorated the heightened superoxide anion level in RVLM of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Protection against oxidative stress in RVLM by rosiglitazone was abrogated by PPAR-gamma small interfering RNA or by antisense oligonucleotide against ucp2 mRNA. Gene knockdown of ucp2 in RVLM also reversed the antihypertensive effect of rosiglitazone. These results suggest that oral intake of rosiglitazone promotes a central antihypertensive effect by decreasing sympathetic vasomotor activity through a PPAR-gamma-dependent protection against oxidative stress in RVLM via transcriptional upregulation of the mitochondrial UCP2.
In this study, we performed in vitro and in vivo studies to examine whether a 70% ethanol extract of Prunus mume fruits (EMS) exhibits anti-diabetic effects. Treatment with EMS increased glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes, and also increased PPAR-γ activity or PPAR-γ mRNA expression. To confirm these in vitro results, we next conducted an animal experiment. A high-fat diet significantly increased the body weight, fat accumulation, and glucose levels in mice. Under the same conditions, 5% EMS attenuated the high-fat diet-induced increase in body weight and fat accumulation and improved the impaired fasting glucose level and glucose tolerance. High performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that EMS contained chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, luteolin-7-glucoside, naringin, apigenin-7-glucoside, and hesperidin. Taken together, these findings suggest that EMS exerts an anti-diabetic effect both in vitro and in vivo, which is mediated, at least in part, by the activation of PPAR-γ.
Amiodarone, an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent, has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patients. To gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect, mice were administered various doses of amiodarone and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation. Amiodarone induced hepatomegaly, hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation, and a significant decrease in serum triglycerides and glucose. Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA revealed a dose-dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation, lipoprotein assembly, and lipid transport. Many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor. The absence of induction of these genes as well as hepatomegaly in PPARalpha knockout [PPARalpha-/-] mice indicated that the effects of amiodarone were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene. Compared to wild-type mice, treatment of PPARalpha-/- mice with amiodarone resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight loss. The inability of amiodarone to directly activate either human or mouse PPARalpha transiently expressed in human HepG2 hepatoma cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were indirect. Based upon these results, we conclude that amiodarone disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of PPARalpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effect. These results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the hepatotoxic effects of amiodarone and indicate that PPARalpha protects against amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity.
Free radicals are highly reactive molecules implicated in the pathology of traumatic brain injury and cerebral ischemia, through a mechanism known as oxidative stress. After brain injury, reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species may be generated through several different cellular pathways, including calcium activation of phospholipases, nitric oxide synthase, xanthine oxidase, the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions, by inflammatory cells. If cellular defense systems are weakened, increased production of free radicals will lead to oxidation of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, which may alter cellular function in a critical way. The study of each of these pathways may be complex and laborious since free radicals are extremely short-lived. Recently, genetic manipulation of wild-type animals has yielded species that over- or under-express genes such as, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide synthase, and the Bcl-2 protein. The introduction of the species has improved the understanding of oxidative stress. We conclude here that substantial experimental data links oxidative stress with other pathogenic mechanisms such as excitotoxicity, calcium overload, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis in central nervous system (CNS) trauma and ischemia, and that utilization of genetically manipulated animals offers a unique possibility to elucidate the role of free radicals in CNS injury in a molecular fashion.
Pimavanserin tartrate is the first 5-HT(2A) inverse agonist to enter clinical trials as a treatment for L-dopa-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease and for augmentation of low-dose risperidone treatment in schizophrenia. Pimavanserin is also being evaluated as a possible anti-insomnia drug.
To discuss the potential of pimavanserin to fill multiple therapeutic needs.
The problems with currently approved antipsychotics and sleep agents are explored to highlight how pimavanserin might address some longstanding issues in the treatment of psychosis and insomnia.
In Phase II clinical trials, pimavanserin seemed to be safe, well-tolerated and efficacious in treating L-dopa-induced psychosis without worsening motor symptoms. Pimavanserin also potentiated the therapeutic effects of low-dose risperidone, reduced haloperidol-induced akathisia, and increased slow-wave sleep in older individuals.
VC is an important clinical entity; however, very little information is available on its resolution. Induction and regression of calcitriol-induced VC was studied in 47 rats. After calcitriol withdrawal, there was a relatively rapid regression of VC mediated by an active cellular process.
Vascular calcifications (VCs) represent an important risk factor for cardiovascular death. Although VCs are prevalent in relevant diseases (e.g., chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, diabetes), the reversibility of extraskeletal calcifications is an unresolved issue. This study was conducted to investigate (1) the in vivo effect of calcitriol on VC and (2) whether calcitriol-induced VC would regress after suppression of calcitriol treatment.
The calcifying effect of calcitriol was studied in four groups of rats (n = 8) that received calcitriol (1 mug/kg, IP) for 2, 4, 6, and 8 days. The reversibility of VC was studied in three additional groups (n = 5) treated with 1 mug/kg of calcitriol for 8 days that were subsequently killed 1, 2, and 9 weeks after the last calcitriol dose. Aortic VC was assessed by histology and by quantification of aortic calcium and phosphorus content. The aortic wall was studied by histology and immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and t-tests.
Calcitriol administration resulted in a time-dependent induction of VC, with aortic calcium and phosphorus being significantly increased at 6 and 8 days. Treatment with calcitriol for 8 days resulted in massive medial calcification of the aorta with a 10- to 30-fold increase in the aortic Ca and P content. After suppressing calcitriol administration, a progressive decrease in von Kossa staining and aortic Ca (from 32.8 +/- 2.5 to 9.3 +/- 1.8 mg/g of tissue, p < 0.001) and P (from 11.9 +/- 1.2 to 2.7 +/- 1.8 mg/g of tissue, p = 0.001) content was evidenced. Histology of the aortic wall showed monocytes adhered to the aortic endothelium and macrophages involved in the reabsorption of calcium deposits.
Our results show that calcitriol treatment induces time-dependent VC. After calcitriol withdrawal, VC regress rapidly with aortic calcium and phosphorus decreasing by 75% in the course of 9 weeks. An active cellular process seems to be involved in regression of VC.
Levosimendan is a new agent for the treatment of acute heart failure. Levosimendan acts via complementary mechanisms; it enhances contractility by sensitising cardiac myofilaments to calcium and dilates blood vessels by opening ATP-dependent potassium channels. In contrast to traditional inotropes (beta-agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors), levosimendan does not raise myocyte calcium levels and is therefore less likely to elicit arrhythmias or to impair diastolic relaxation. The clinical efficacy of levosimendan is supported by four key clinical studies, including more than 900 patients hospitalised for cardiac decompensation due to acutely worsened chronic heart failure or to heart failure following myocardial infarction. When given as short-term therapy, levosimendan enhances cardiac output, reduces systemic vascular resistance and lowers pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 31 days post-treatment, mortality rates were halved in decompensated chronic heart failure patients who received levosimendan, compared with those on dobutamine--an advantage sustained at 180 days. Similar survival gains were observed among acute failure patients treated with levosimendan following myocardial infarction. With its substantial haemodynamic and survival benefits, levosimendan is well suited to be part of routine management for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure.
Seventeen cases of severe hyponatremia induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy have been reported in the literature. The mechanism of severe hyponatremia induced by ACE inhibitor is not clear. A 60-year-old white man with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was treated with enalapril, 20 mg daily, that had been started 2 weeks before heart transplantation. The serum sodium level was 138 mmol/L before initiation of enalapril therapy and 127 mmol/L just before cardiac surgery. In the post-heart transplantation period, enalapril therapy was withdrawn for the perianesthesia period, and the serum sodium level increased from 127 to 140 mmol/L. One month later, viral myocarditis developed in the patient and enalapril was reintroduced at 20 mg daily. Two weeks later, natremia decreased. Enalapril was discontinued. Three days later the serum sodium level rose to 140 mmol/L. Severe symptomatic hyponatremia induced by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone should be considered a rare but possible complication associated with ACE inhibitor therapy.
Methotrexate (MTX) is a drug widely used in the treatment of patients with malignant disease. Its well-known side effects include myelosuppression, mucositis and renal damage. These problems are primarily dose-related, tending to occur more frequently when high doses (greater than 1 g/m2) are given. We present four cases in whom severe renal and mucosal toxicity occurred with intermediate doses (200 mg/m2) of MTX despite folinic acid rescue. Possible reasons for this occurrence are discussed and means of avoiding such toxicity are suggested. Three of four patients developed severe loin pain within a few hours of injection; the significance of this symptom in relation to subsequent renal toxicity has implications for early recognition of the problem.
A community survey was conducted among long-term (>6 months) users of codeine-containing products to characterize chronic use of these extensively consumed medications. Respondents recruited through newspaper advertisements completed a mailed questionnaire. Three hundred thirty-nine completed questionnaires were obtained, yielding a response rate of 70%. Codeine dependence/abuse as defined by DSM-IV criteria was present in 41% of the respondents. Two thirds of the subjects had sought help for mental health problems, most often depression (70%). Scores on the Symptom Checklist-90 subscales were modestly elevated, particularly on the Depression subscale (1.2 +/- 0.9). Long-term codeine use is strongly associated with dependence. Depression and depressive symptoms are common. These data suggest that dysphoric mood states may be significant in maintaining long-term codeine use.
The current standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, is plagued by a number of side effects, most notably anemia. This anemia is typically managed with a reduction of ribavirin dosing, which may lead to reduced efficacy. Taribavirin, an oral prodrug of ribavirin, which has been shown to induce a lesser degree of anemia, is being investigated for the treatment of chronic HCV.
To summarize the clinical trials involving taribavirin and its potential role in the treatment of chronic HCV.
Information was obtained via searches for data related to taribavirin, as well as other current and investigational therapies for chronic HCV. Press releases discussing otherwise unpublished trial outcomes were obtained from the website of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the producer of Viramidine (taribavirin).
Taribavirin may increase adherence to therapy for chronic HCV by reducing the need for dose reduction due to anemia. A recent Phase II trial investigating early and sustained virological response showed no statistically significant differences between ribavirin 1000/1200 mg and taribavirin at 800-, 1200-, or 1600-mg dosing, while illustrating a lesser degree of anemia in 800- and 1200-mg dosing of taribavirin. Ongoing studies will continue to examine the efficacy of combination therapy with taribavirin in the place of ribavirin.
There is little systematically derived evidence-based guidance to inform plasma transfusion decisions. To address this issue, the AABB commissioned the development of clinical practice guidelines to help direct appropriate transfusion of plasma.
A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis of randomized and observational studies was performed to quantify known benefits and harms of plasma transfusion in common clinical scenarios (see accompanying article). A multidisciplinary guidelines panel then used the SR and the GRADE methodology to develop evidence-based plasma transfusion guidelines as well as identify areas for future investigation.
Based on evidence ranging primarily from moderate to very low in quality, the panel developed the following guidelines: 1) The panel suggested that plasma be transfused to patients requiring massive transfusion. However, 2) the panel could not recommend for or against transfusion of plasma at a plasma : red blood cell ratio of 1:3 or more during massive transfusion, 3) nor could the panel recommend for or against transfusion of plasma to patients undergoing surgery in the absence of massive transfusion. 4) The panel suggested that plasma be transfused in patients with warfarin therapy-related intracranial hemorrhage, 5) but could not recommend for or against transfusion of plasma to reverse warfarin anticoagulation in patients without intracranial hemorrhage. 6) The panel suggested against plasma transfusion for other selected groups of patients.
We have systematically developed evidence-based guidance to inform plasma transfusion decisions in common clinical scenarios. Data from additional randomized studies will be required to establish more comprehensive and definitive guidelines for plasma transfusion.
Intravesical instillation of mitomycin C is a routine practice for treatment of superficial transitional cell carcinoma of bladder. Despite usual precautions serious side effects like fistulation can occur with diverse presentation as illustrated by this report. The pathology demonstrates a dense necrotic and massive inflammatory reaction in the peri vesical tissue following the extravasation of an intravesically administered chemotherapeutic agent. The severe inflammatory tissue response and the necrotic effect associated with the extravasated chemotherapeutic agent could potentially lead to local sepsis with a subsequent fistula formation.
Abnormal lipid metabolism and cell oxidative mechanisms are reported in patients on antiretroviral treatment. We compared the expression of several key adipocyte genes in HIV-infected patients randomized to antiretroviral regimens containing zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).
Subcutaneous fat was sampled from 32 HIV-positive treatment-naive patients before and 6 months after randomization to AZT/lamivudine/efavirenz (n=15) or TDF/emtricitabine/efavirenz (n=17) plus 15 HIV-negative matched controls. Expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and glucocorticoid generation were profiled using real-time PCR. Lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activity were assessed.
Before treatment, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expression was down-regulated compared with controls. Following 6 months treatment with AZT, there was a significant increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT; P=0.02) and the ratio of VAT to subcutaneous adipose tissue (P=0.008), down-regulation of cytochrome B (P=0.003) and cytochrome oxidase (COX)-3 gene expression (P=0.03), up-regulation of NADH dehydrogenase (P=0.008) and nuclear-encoded COX-4 (complex IV) gene expression (P=0.012). Genes involved with adipocyte cortisol generation, fatty acid metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were up-regulated. In the TDF-treated patients, there was no significant change in regional body fat or mitochondrial genes compared with pretreatment values. Changes in the expression of genes involved with cortisol and fatty acid metabolism were less marked with TDF.
Interference with the mitochondrial electron transport chain appears to occur early in an AZT-containing regimen and occurs at a time when there is increased visceral fat and up-regulation of genes involved with adipocyte differentiation and fatty acid flux.
The authors report the case of myocardial infarction occurring immediately after rapid intravenous infusion of a high dose of corticosteroids prescribed for a relapse of multiple sclerosis. Ventriculography confirmed the myocardial damage but the coronary arteries were normal. An aetiological investigation was negative. The authors review the cardiac secondary effects which may be very serious and even fatal. Coronary insufficiency is rare (only 3 previously published cases); it is therefore difficult to determine the prognosis. The possible mechanisms of infarction are discussed. Finally, the authors underline the importance of recording an ECG before treatment, of ECG monitoring during the infusion, and the need for repeating the recordings and of prolonging hospital admission when necessary.
In 3 dogs scheduled for surgical removal of cataracts, systemic and topical treatment with antibiotics and topical ocular treatment with prednisolone, atropine, flurbiprofen, and phenylephrine were used to achieve maximal mydriasis, with minimal risk of pupillary constriction in response to surgery. Each dog developed arterial hypertension, with systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures ranging from 170 to 205, 90 to 112, and 123 to 148 mm of Hg, respectively. Hypertension was treated with acepromazine maleate (0.001 to 0.005 mg/kg of body weight) i.v., decreasing arterial pressures to reference values. Phenylephrine dosages for topical use ranged from 50 to 367 times greater than the i.v. dose required to increase arterial pressure by 50% in anesthetized dogs. Although adverse sequelae to these episodes of hypertension were not noticed, this report documents the uptake of phenylephrine from topical ocular application and suggests the need for dose-response measurements for this adjunct to mydriatic treatment in dogs.
We investigated the efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl for severe mucositis pain caused by chemotherapy.
Thirty-two patients who had moderate to severe pain using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) were enrolled in this study. The analgesic effect, quality of life and side effects were evaluated after the administration of transdermal fentanyl.
The median NRS score was reduced from 6 (range 4 - 9) before treatment to 4 (range 0 - 9), 2.5 (range 0 - 8), 2 (range 0 - 8), 2 (range 0 - 6) and 0 (range 0 - 5) on days 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15, respectively, after treatment (p < 0.001). The patients' quality of life also improved significantly (p < 0.01). The side effects of treatment were mild, and disappeared within several days.
Transdermal fentanyl is an effective, convenient and well-tolerated treatment for severe mucositis pain caused by chemotherapy that can improve patients' quality of life.
Tolcapone is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that has shown efficacy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The authors undertook the first study on the efficacy of this COMT inhibitor in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The authors also wanted to assess the effects of tolcapone on the choline and myoinositol resonances in the left caudate and dorsolateral frontal lobe through proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and on whole blood levels of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe). The study enrolled 21 adults (10 men and 11 women; mean age, 42.6 +/- 9.6 years) with MDD, which was diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and an initial score of > or = 16 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17). Patients were then treated openly for 8 weeks with tolcapone 400 mg twice daily. Treatment efficacy was assessed with the HAM-D-17, the Clinical Global Impressions Severity (CGI-S) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Among all subjects (N = 21), there were significant (p < .0001) decreases at endpoint in HAM-D-17 scores (from 19.4 +/- 2.9 to 10.7 +/- 5.5), CGI-S scores (from 3.9 +/- 0.6 to 2.4 +/- 1.1), and BDI scores (from 21.6 +/- 8.1 to 12.3 +/- 8.6). Eight patients (38%) dropped out before completing the 8-week open study because of diarrhea, elevated liver function tests, increased anxiety, and noncompliance. No significant effects were noted on choline and myoinositol resonance or on SAMe levels in whole blood before and after 2 weeks of tolcapone treatment. The preliminary results suggest that tolcapone may be a promising agent in the treatment of MDD. Furthermore, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary to confirm this impression.
Variation in susceptibility of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata to infection by the parasite Schistosoma mansoni is, at least in part, genetically determined. Functional studies have demonstrated that hemocyte-mediated killing of the parasite involves hydrogen peroxide, the enzymatic product of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The present study identifies alleles of the gene coding for cytosolic copper/zinc SOD (SOD1). The resistance/susceptibility phenotypes and SOD1 genotypes were determined for 354 snails of the predominantly resistant 13-16-R1 strain of B. glabrata. Resistance to the parasite was found to be significantly associated with one allele of the SOD1 gene. Conversely, a separate SOD1 allele was significantly associated with susceptibility.
During antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis C, patients frequently report impairment of concentration or memory. Therefore we prospectively investigated neurocognitive performance in patients receiving interferon alfa and ribavirin.
Repeated computer-based testing of neurocognitive function was performed in 70 patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving interferon alfa-2b (pegylated or conventional) and ribavirin. In addition, depression scores were obtained (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).
Reaction times were significantly increased during treatment (mean reaction time increase after 3 months of therapy: alertness, 46.76 ms [95% confidence interval (CI)], 26.86-66.66 ms), P < .001; divided attention, 47.04 ms [95% CI, 26.44-67.64 ms], P < .001; vigilance, 60.78 ms [95% CI, 29.24-92.32 ms], P < .001; and working memory, 38.53 ms [95% CI, 1.22-75.83], P = .34). Accuracy measures (number of false reactions) were affected for the working-memory task exclusively. Cognitive performance returned to pretreatment values after the end of therapy. Cognitive impairment was not significantly correlated with the degree of concomitant depression (0.04 < r [absolute value] < 0.10, P > .390).
Interferon-based combination therapy of chronic hepatitis C causes significant but reversible impairment of neurocognitive performance. Consequences for the requirements of an active life in patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving antiviral therapy need to be assessed.
We report a case of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced leukoencephalopathy in which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), was performed serially. The initial T2-weighted and FLAIR images showed diffuse mild hyperintensity in bilateral deep cerebral white matter and corpus callosum, which on T1WI appeared as non-enhanced faint hypointensity. Isotropic DWI disclosed the abnormality as well-conspicuous diffuse hyperintensity with decreased ADC. Serial studies revealed that majority of the abnormal signal intensity on these sequences resolved, and the decreased ADC values approached normal. Some hyperintensity remained in the deep cerebral white matter and the splenium, but no further significant ADC change after normalization was noted. Measurement of ADC along the three orthogonal directions showed the presence of directional dependence of diffusion throughout the length of study. These findings suggest that early stage of 5-FU-induced leukoencephalopathy is associated with reversible restricted diffusion and preservation of anisotropy. Diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful for the diagnosis.
Although chemical peels may be used for precancerous lesions, no histologic or immunohistochemical studies have been performed to validate clinical impressions and/or outcome.
Our purpose was to investigate the efficacy and prognostic relevance of phenol peels in Japanese patients with actinic keratosis and Bowen disease using clinical and histologic criteria.
A total of 46 patients were treated with phenol peels, and followed up for at least 1 year after treatment. Biopsy specimens were taken before and after treatment. Cases of complete response were classified by the number of treatment sessions. We evaluated parameters for epidermal thickness, proliferation, dysplasia, and apoptosis, and clinical characteristics to correlate phenol peels with assessments of efficacy, patient-selection criteria, and risk for transformation to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.
There were 39 (84.8%) patients with a complete response after one to 8 treatment sessions. Statistically, differences in clinical improvement with peels and the number of treatment sessions correlated with histology, personal history of skin cancer, tumor thickness, and cyclin A expression.
This study was a prospective pilot trial. Blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized studies would be ideal.
We conclude that phenol peels are very effective for treating precancerous lesions of actinic keratosis and Bowen disease. In addition, our study clearly demonstrates that tumor thickness and cyclin A could be specific and useful markers as adjunctive diagnostic tools to predict the efficacy of phenol treatment of these lesions.
