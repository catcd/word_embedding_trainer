AIDS-related encephalopathy, including AIDS dementia complex (ADC) and the opportunistic disease, herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), are postulated to arise due to the release of neurotoxic products, such as quinolinic acid (QUIN), by activated microglial cells in the brain. QUIN causes a cascade of events to occur, which leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), these being ultimately responsible for oxidative neurotoxicity. The antiherpes antiviral aciclovir has been reported to protect against neuron loss in HSE, but the mechanism for this neuroprotection is unknown. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate whether aciclovir has the ability to inhibit QUIN-induced lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates, after in-vitro and in-vivo exposure to QUIN and aciclovir. The thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay was the method used to analyse lipid peroxidation. Rat brains were also examined histologically after in-vivo exposure to visually assess whether neuron loss was suppressed. The results show that aciclovir inhibits the QUIN-induced lipid peroxidation, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, aciclovir reduced necrosis of hippocampal neurons and retained the characteristic morphology, integrity and arrangement of these cells. Thus, it appears that aciclovir has neuroprotective properties, which could possibly be useful in the treatment of AIDS-related encephalopathy.
Hepatic failure associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the main indications for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).
Twenty-nine LDLTs, including liver cirrhosis due to HBV (LC-B) (n = 17) and fulminant hepatitis B (FH-B) (n = 12) were reviewed. Prophylaxis for reinfection was performed with a combination of lamivudine, or hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) or adefovir, depending on the viral status. The changes in serological markers, recurrence and survival rate were examined.
There were 3 patients with re-emergencies of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg): suspension of HBIG for giving vaccination for HBV (n = 1), HBsAg positive donor (n = 1) and non-compliance for HBIG (n = 1). All patients with YMDD mutants (n = 9), except the case with HBsAg positive donor (n = 1), were successfully protected by the triple therapy of lamivudine, adefovir and HBIG. No graft loss was due to the recurrence of HBV.
The basic strategy using a combination of HBIG and antiviral agents gave acceptable long-term outcomes for LDLT for HBV associated liver diseases. The close monitoring of HBV viral status after transplantation is still crucial in managing these patients.
Perhexiline maleate was used as a prophylactic agent in 26 patients suffering from severe angina pectoris. The mean duration of treatment was 8.9 months, with a maximum of 28 months. Fifteen patients experienced a reduction in frequency of attacks to less than one-third of their previous level; six experienced a reduction to two-thirds of their previous level; no patient showed an increase in attack rates. During the period of study, there was one death. Frequently observed side effects included dizziness, gastrointestinal irritation and malaise. One patient developed clinically apparent hepatic dysfunction which resolved on withdrawal of perhexiline maleate, but recurred after rechallenge with a lower dose of the drug; the results of liver function tests in five others showed mild abnormalities. One patient developed peripheral neuropathy after taking perhexiline maleate for 18 months, but this resolved in two months after cessation of therapy. Good responses to perhexiline maleate were observed in patients who were concurrently treated with beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs.
Treatment of postpartum haemorrhage because of uterine atony with intramyometrial prostaglandin E2 1 mg, in an anaesthetised patient resulted in life-threatening hypotension. Anaesthetists should be aware of the potential cardiovascular side effects of prostaglandins.
Severe acetaminophen hepatotoxicity frequently leads to acute liver failure (ALF). We determined the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of acetaminophen-induced ALF at 22 tertiary care centers in the United States. Detailed prospective data were gathered on 662 consecutive patients over a 6-year period fulfilling standard criteria for ALF (coagulopathy and encephalopathy), from which 275 (42%) were determined to result from acetaminophen liver injury. The annual percentage of acetaminophen-related ALF rose during the study from 28% in 1998 to 51% in 2003. Median dose ingested was 24 g (equivalent to 48 extra-strength tablets). Unintentional overdoses accounted for 131 (48%) cases, intentional (suicide attempts) 122 (44%), and 22 (8%) were of unknown intent. In the unintentional group, 38% took two or more acetaminophen preparations simultaneously, and 63% used narcotic-containing compounds. Eighty-one percent of unintentional patients reported taking acetaminophen and/or other analgesics for acute or chronic pain syndromes. Overall, 178 subjects (65%) survived, 74 (27%) died without transplantation, and 23 subjects (8%) underwent liver transplantation; 71% were alive at 3 weeks. Transplant-free survival rate and rate of liver transplantation were similar between intentional and unintentional groups. In conclusion, acetaminophen hepatotoxicity far exceeds other causes of acute liver failure in the United States. Susceptible patients have concomitant depression, chronic pain, alcohol or narcotic use, and/or take several preparations simultaneously. Education of patients, physicians, and pharmacies to limit high-risk use settings is recommended.
Five patients with basal cell carcinoma received fenretinide. Two patients while receiving the drug had evidence of abnormal rod photoreceptor function that reversed rapidly on cessation of therapy. We speculate that fenretinide may interfere with the binding of vitamin A to opsin or with the transport of vitamin A.
Pharmacological and molecular biological tools were used to validate the involvement of sigma receptors in the actions of cocaine. Radioligand binding studies demonstrated significant levels of sigma receptors in the brain and heart, where cocaine interacts preferentially with the sigma(1) subtype. In behavioral pharmacological studies using mice, nine novel sigma receptor antagonists significantly attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions, while structural analogs with weak interactions with sigma receptors were ineffective. In contrast to the protection provided by the antagonists, a classical sigma receptor agonist exacerbated the convulsive effects of cocaine. The antagonists also attenuated cocaine-induced lethality, with the best compound protecting against death even when administered as a post-treatment. At doses where the antagonists had no effect on baseline locomotor activity, they significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine, suggesting their ability to block the psychomotor as well as the toxic effects of cocaine. To further validate that the anti-cocaine effects were achieved by interfering with cocaine's access to sigma receptors, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against sigma(1) receptors were shown to attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. Together, the studies support the involvement of sigma receptors, particularly the sigma(1) subtype, in the behavioral effects of cocaine.
We previously reported that histamine H(1) receptor gene knockout mice (H1KO) showed lower spontaneous nociceptive threshold to pain stimuli when compared to wild-type mice. The objective of the present study was to examine the antinociceptive effect of intrathecally-administered morphine in H1KO mice. The antinociceptive effects of morphine were examined using assays for thermal (tail-flick, hot-plate, paw-withdrawal), mechanical (tail-pressure) and chemical nociception (formalin and capsaicin tests) using H1KO and wild-type mice. In these nociceptive assays, intrathecally-administered morphine produced significant antinociceptive effects in wild-type mice. The antinociceptive effect produced by intrathecally administered morphine was enhanced in the knockout mice. We also examined the effect of an histamine H(1) receptor antagonist, an active (d-) isomer of chlorpheniramine, on morphine-induced antinociception in ICR mice. The intrathecal co-administration of d-chlorpheniramine enhanced the effect of morphine in all nociceptive assays examined. The pharmacological experiments using d-chlorpheniramine further substantiate the evidence for the histamine H(1) receptor-mediated suppression of morphine-induced antinociception. These results suggest that existing H(1) receptors play an inhibitory role in morphine-induced antinociception at the spinal cord level.
Body composition has emerged as an important prognostic factor in cancer patients. Severe depletion of skeletal muscle (sarcopenia) and, hence, of overall lean body mass may represent an occult condition in individuals with normal or even high body weight. Sarcopenia has been associated with poor performance status, 5-fluorouracil toxicity, and shortened survival in cancer patients. Here, we prospectively studied patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving capecitabine treatment in order to determine if sarcopenia was associated with a higher incidence of toxicity and a shorter time to tumor progression (TTP).
Fifty-five women with metastatic breast cancer resistant to anthracycline and/or taxane treatment were included. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebra was measured by computerized tomography, and sarcopenia was defined using a previously published cutoff point. Toxicity was assessed after cycle 1 of treatment, and TTP was determined prospectively.
Approximately 25% of patients were classified as sarcopenic, and this feature was seen in normal weight, overweight, and obese individuals. Toxicity was present in 50% of sarcopenic patients, compared with only 20% of nonsarcopenic patients (P = 0.03), and TTP was shorter in sarcopenic patients (101.4 days; confidence interval, 59.8-142.9) versus nonsarcopenic patients (173.3 days; confidence interval, 126.1-220.5; P = 0.05).
Sarcopenia is a significant predictor of toxicity and TTP in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with capecitabine. Our results raise the potential use of body composition assessment to predict toxicity and individualize chemotherapy dosing.
The polyamines are organic polycations present at millimolar concentrations in eukaryotic cells where they participate in the regulation of vital cellular functions including proliferation and differentiation. Biological evaluation of rationally designed polyamine analogs is one of the cornerstones of polyamine research. Here we have synthesized and characterized novel C-methylated spermidine analogs, that is, 2-methylspermidine, 3-methylspermidine, and 8-methylspermidine. 3-Methylspermidine was found to be metabolically stable in DU145 cells, while 8-methylspermidine was a substrate for spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and 2-methylspermidine was a substrate for both SSAT and acetylpolyamine oxidase. All the analogs induced the splicing of the productive mRNA splice variant of SSAT, overcame growth arrest induced by 72-h treatment with ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine, and were transported via the polyamine transporter. Surprisingly, 2-methylspermidine was a weak downregulator of ODC activity in DU145 cells. Our data demonstrates that it is possible to radically alter the biochemical properties of a polyamine analog by changing the position of the methyl group.
Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is an active ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine. Recent studies showed that it causes apoptosis in several cancer cells. However, research of As(2)O(3) in osteosarcoma is sparse. In our present study, an inhibitory effect of As(2)O(3) on osteosarcoma cell adhesion and metastasis was observed with a cell adhesion, migration and invasion test. The impact of As(2)O(3) on the activities of MMP-9 and MAPK pathway-related downstream factors was analyzed by western blotting. Our results showed that As(2)O(3) significantly inhibited motility, migration and invasion in HOS and MNNG cells in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 0.5-2 μM, and led to cytoskeletal rearrangements. As(2)O(3) exerted an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MEK, which are the members of the MAPK family. Additionally, treatment with As(2)O(3) in combination with inhibitors specific for MEK (U0126) in HOS and MNNG cells resulted in a marked inhibition of cell invasion and As(2)O(3) could significantly reduce PMA-induced invasion. In conclusion, we demonstrate the inhibitory effects of As(2)O(3) on the invasiveness of HOS and MNNG cells, which may be due at least partly to inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway.
The toxic effects of halothane on the liver, kidney, and brain are reviewed. Increasing evidence has indicated that hepatic degeneration can be induced in several animal speices after exposure to halothane. Recent electron microscopic investigations have also revealed cytological degeneration of the liver cells after chronic exposure to subclinical levels of halothane. Degeneration of the kidney and the nervous system after halothane exposure have also been reported. The pathological effects of halothane on the neonatal (developing) liver, kidney, and brain are also demonstrated by electron microscopy. Although the full significance of these observations on experimental animals in relationship to human exposure is still not known, the indication of the toxic potential of halothane on the biological system is strong and deserves further investigation.
Permanent neurobehavioral toxicological effects have been theorized to occur at the lowest doses of a toxic agent if exposure occurs during early development compared to exposure during adulthood. Data are reviewed showing the exposure to 10 ppm of halothane from conception to day 60 of life post-partum led to adult rats (>/= 135 days of age) which were hyperalgesic to electric footshock and which committed 30% more errors learning a light-dark discrimination to escape footshock, or learning the shortest path to a food reward in a maze. Exposure only during adulthood to 10 ppm of halothane (from day 60 of life onwards) had no effects. To determine prenatal periods sensitive to halothane, rats were exposed to 12,500 ppm of halothane (with 35% oxygen) on day 3, 10, or 17 of gestation. As adults (>/= 75 days of age) day 3- and day 10-exposed rats, but not day 17-exposed rats, were hyperalgesic and committed 40% more errors in learning a visual discrimination to escape footshock. Food and water consumption, body weight, and running wheel activity were unaffected. Finally, adult rats exposed to 10, 50, or 100 ppm of halothane from conception to day 28 postpartum had 15% less 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in brain, but normal 5-hydroxytryptophan, noradrenalin, and dopamine. The possibility is discussed that the hyperalgesia noted above results from a permanently reduced turnover of brain serotonin produced by halothane present in brain at days 10-15 of gestation.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are caused by activating mutations in the KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinase genes. Although >85% of GIST patients treated with the small-molecule inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) achieve disease stabilization, complete remissions are rare and a substantial proportion of patients develop resistance to imatinib over time. Upregulation of soluble, non-chromatin-bound histone H2AX has an important role in imatinib-induced apoptosis of GIST cells. Additionally, H2AX levels in untreated GIST are maintained at low levels by a pathway that involves KIT, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In this study, we asked whether bortezomib-mediated inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery could lead to upregulation of histone H2AX and GIST cell death. We show that bortezomib rapidly triggers apoptosis in GIST cells through a combination of mechanisms involving H2AX upregulation and loss of KIT protein expression. Downregulation of KIT transcription was an underlying mechanism for bortezomib-mediated inhibition of KIT expression. In contrast, the nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway did not seem to play a major role in bortezomib-induced GIST cell death. Significantly, we found that bortezomib would induce apoptosis in two imatinib-resistant GIST cell lines as well as a short-term culture established from a primary imatinib-resistant GIST. Collectively, our results provide a rationale to test the efficacy of bortezomib in GIST patients with imatinib-sensitive or -resistant tumors.
A double-blind pilot study was conducted on 27 consenting human volunteers who had irreversible pulpitis associated with persistent toothache pain from open carious lesions. Formulations tested contained either 0, 10%, or 20% benzocaine and were identified only by a numbered code. Before the experiment started, a small amount of a known 5% benzocaine gel was placed for 1 minute on the tongue of each patient to assure a sensation of numbness within the oral cavity. Then the test tooth was washed with a gentle stream of warm water and dried with gauze. A randomly selected test medication was placed into the open cavity and around the gingival margins for 5 minutes. Pre- and posttreatment tests were conducted at the following timed intervals: 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 minutes. The tests included degree of pain (rated: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe); electrical pulp testing (EPT) by a modified, voltage-ramping instrument; and ice water testing (0.5 mL directed quickly onto sound enamel of the tooth and rated: 0 to 4, with 4 being intolerable). After testing, or when pain returned to baseline, endodontic procedures were performed. There was a significant increase (p < 0.032, Fisher exact test) in subjects obtaining pain relief, rated by verbal descriptors, from the benzocaine gels (14 out of 18 improved) compared to placebo (3 out of 9 improved). It was concluded that: 1) benzocaine gels are effective formulations for temporary relief of toothache pain, 2) there were no statistical differences in EPT scores between teeth having pulpitis and control teeth, 3) there were no correlations between direction of EPT scores and pain relief, 4) cold water testing was a good predictor of whether or not a tooth had pulpitis, and 5) changes in cold water testing scores after treatment could not be correlated to relief of pain according to verbal descriptors. The effectiveness of benzocaine in relieving toothache pain verifies previous studies; however, a difference between 10% and 20% benzocaine could not be demonstrated probably because of two factors: 1) the present experiment had a small sample size, and 2) there was no direct measurement of duration of local anesthesia.
Research using reconstructed exposure histories has suggested an association between heavy metal exposures, including lead, and Parkinson's disease (PD), but the only study that used bone lead, a biomarker of cumulative lead exposure, found a nonsignificant increase in risk of PD with increasing bone lead.
We sought to assess the association between bone lead and PD.
Bone lead concentrations were measured using 109Cd excited K-shell X-ray fluorescence from 330 PD patients (216 men, 114 women) and 308 controls (172 men, 136 women) recruited from four clinics for movement disorders and general-community cohorts. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for PD were calculated using logistic regression.
The average age of cases and controls at bone lead measurement was 67 (SD = 10) and 69 (SD = 9) years of age, respectively. In primary analyses of cases and controls recruited from the same groups, compared with the lowest quartile of tibia lead, the OR for PD in the highest quartile was 3.21 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-8.83]. Results were similar but slightly weaker in analyses restricted to cases and controls recruited from the movement disorders clinics only (fourth-quartile OR = 2.57; 95% CI, 1.11-5.93) or when we included controls recruited from sites that did not also contribute cases (fourth-quartile OR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.01-3.60). We found no association with patella bone lead.
These findings, using an objective biological marker of cumulative lead exposure among typical PD patients seen in our movement disorders clinics, strengthen the evidence that cumulative exposure to lead increases the risk of PD.
We report the use of the non-specific adenosine antagonist theophylline (aminophylline) during a prolonged intraoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) due to myocardial infarction. In the 2005 guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council the general use of theophylline during CPR is not recommended, but in the case of an atropine and epinephrine resistant asystole, especially as a result of inferior myocardial infarction, theophylline might be a useful adjunct during CPR.
Focal subtenon carboplatin injections have recently been used as a presumably toxicity-free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma.
To report our clinical experience with abnormal ocular motility in patients treated with subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy.
We noted abnormal ocular motility in 10 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma who had received subtenon carboplatin. During ocular manipulation under general anesthesia, we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing, comparing ocular motility after tumor control with ocular motility at diagnosis. Eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure (n = 4) were examined histologically.
Limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for intraocular retinoblastoma with 1 to 6 injections of subtenon carboplatin as part of multimodality therapy. Histopathological examination revealed many lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye, indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat necrosis. The enucleations were technically difficult and hazardous for globe rupture because of extensive orbital soft tissue adhesions.
Subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy is associated with significant fibrosis of orbital soft tissues, leading to mechanical restriction of eye movements and making subsequent enucleation difficult. Subtenon carboplatin is not free of toxicity, and its use is best restricted to specific indications.
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of a combination of dacarbazine (D) and fotemustine (F) administered to a homogenous group of patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Thirty-one patients with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan evidence of recurrent or progressive GBM after first-line chemotherapy with nitrosoureas as well as radiation therapy were given a combination of D (200 mg/m2) and F (100 mg/m2). At 30 min after termination of D administration, F was given over 60 min. Treatment was performed in an outpatient setting every 21 days. A total of 140 cycles (range 1-12 cycles; median 4 cycles) was administered. One partial response (3%) lasting for 11 weeks was observed. Sixteen (52%) patients reached stable disease lasting between 7 and 94 weeks. Median survival from start of the D/F combination was 45 (range 10-150) weeks. Median time to progression was 17 (3-101) weeks for all patients. Major toxicity was myelosuppression resulting in exclusion from study in seven (23%) patients [due to thrombocytopenia common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 2 persisting longer than 3 weeks in three patients, due to thrombocytopenia CTC grade >/=3 in three and due to leukopenia CTC grade 3 in one patient]. No other toxicity than alopecia occurred. We conclude that the D/F combination is a well-tolerated second-line regimen and can be administered in a complete outpatient setting. D/F shows efficacy even in nitrosourea-pretreated patients and justifies further investigation.
The effects of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) on systolic blood pressure, and echocardiographic indexes of heart size and function were investigated in 14 infants. After 25 days (range 13 to 46) of treatment with ACTH, systolic blood pressure increased from 93 +/- 9 to 118 +/- 20 mm Hg (p < 0.001; mean +/- 1 SD). Systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than the 95th percentile for age) developed in 10 of 14 infants and was associated with an increase in left ventricular (LV) shortening fraction from 41 +/- 5% to 52 +/- 8% (p < 0.001). Myocardial hypertrophy and an increase in echocardiographic indexes of myocardial contractility were observed also. To assess the temporal relation between the onset of systolic hypertension and these cardiac changes, data from 8 infants with serial echocardiograms and blood pressure determinations were examined. After a mean 14 days (range 8 to 18) of ACTH, LV shortening fraction increased from 39 +/- 6% to 53 +/- 8% (p < 0.01), whereas systolic blood pressure remained normal in 7 of 8 infants. In addition, a decrease in LV end-systolic dimension was observed during this early phase. This report documents myocardial changes in individual patients, which occur before and during the development of systolic hypertension.
To report a case in which triphasic waves developed during pentobarbital treatment. Pentobarbital coma is indicated in status epilepticus, refractory to other anticonvulsants, and in certain neurologic conditions in order to decrease brain metabolism. At high doses of pentobarbital, the EEG shows a typical burst-suppression pattern, while at low doses, diffuse slowing. Triphasic waves have not been reported in association with pentobarbital. A 54-year-old female underwent surgery for giant ophthalmic aneurysm clipping. Due to tearing and bleeding of the carotid artery, a clamp was placed, an external-internal carotid artery bypass was done, and the patient was started on pentobarbital. The patient remained comatose, the EEG showed a burst-suppression pattern, and the pentobarbital level was 30.5 micrograms/dl. One week later, the patient was still comatose, the EEG showed generalized triphasic waves with anterior predominance, and the pentobarbital level was 11 micrograms/dl. One day later, the patient was awake, and the EEG was normalized. The patient made a complete recovery. Triphasic waves may be seen in patients on pentobarbital. It is important to recognize this finding in patients on pentobarbital due to status epilepticus. This pattern should not be misinterpreted as 'electrical' status epilepticus.
Activated protein C (APC) is useful in the treatment of sepsis. Ischemia and acidosis, which often accompany sepsis, cause the release of copper from loosely bound sites. We investigated (i) whether physiological concentrations of copper inhibit APC anticoagulant activity and (ii) if any copper-induced APC inhibition is reversible by human serum albumin (HSA) or a high-affinity copper-binding analogue of the human albumin N-terminus, d-Asp-d-Ala-d-His-d-Lys (d-DAHK). APC activity after 30 min of incubation with CuCl2 (10 microM) was decreased 26% below baseline. HSA, both alone and when combined with various ratios of CuCl2, increased APC activity significantly above baseline. d-DAHK alone and 2:1 and 4:1 ratios of d-DAHK:CuCl2 also increased APC activity. APC contained 1.4 microM copper, which helps explain the increased APC activity with HSA and d-DAHK alone. These in vitro results indicate that copper inhibits APC activity and that albumin and d-DAHK reverse the copper-induced APC deactivation.
To describe the incidence, clinical presentation and management of nevirapine-associated hepatitis among antiretroviral-naïve pregnant women treated with nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy at a dedicated antenatal antiretroviral clinic.
Retrospective analysis of pregnant women initiated on nevirapine-based highly active antiretroviral therapy at a dedicated antenatal antiretroviral clinic between July 2004 and December 2006.
Three hundred and ninety women were included in the analysis. Median age was 29 (interquartile range (IQR) 26-32) years and median pre-treatment CD4 cell counts was 157 (IQR 104-193) cells/microl. Baseline alanine transaminase (ALT) was elevated in 2.8% of women (11/390). After initiation of nevirapine-based ART 8% (31/390) experienced an ALT elevation. Three of these patients developed clinical hepatitis with jaundice (0.8%, 3/390). The mean and median time to clinical presentation was 5 weeks. Hepatitis resolved following discontinuation of ART. Non-nevirapine regimens were initiated following biochemical and symptomatic improvement; symptoms did not recur.
Among pregnant women, nevirapine-containing ART has a favourable safety profile, with a low incidence of serious hepatic events.
