To investigate the mechanism of drug-induced priapism, we gave the antipsychotic agent chlorpromazine and the antidepressant trazodone to 14 dogs by intravenous and intracorporeal injection. Bilateral intracorporeal pressure, blood flow within the internal pudendal artery, and systemic blood pressure were monitored. Venous outflow restriction was evaluated by continuous saline infusion of the corpus cavernosum with the infrarenal aorta clamped. When delivered by intracorporeal injection, both drugs induced erection in a manner similar to that of intracorporeal injection of papaverine. Internal pudendal arterial flow increased slightly at the beginning of tumescence, and excellent venous restriction occurred. Intravenous injection, however, could neither induce an erection nor facilitate an erection after sub-threshold neurostimulation. We believe that the alpha-adrenergic antagonist properties of chlorpromazine and trazodone probably cause priapism by local action.
In mammals opiate alkaloids and endogenous opioid peptides exert their physiological and pharmacological actions through opioid receptors (MOR, DOR and KOR) expressed not only on neuroendocrine cells but also on leukocytes. Therefore, opioids can modulate the immune response. We cloned and sequenced all three classical opioid receptors (MOR, DOR and KOR) in common carp, and studied changes in their expression during stress and immune responses. Messenger RNA of opioid receptors was constitutively expressed in brain areas, specially in the preoptic nucleus NPO (homologous to mammalian hypothalamus). After exposure to prolonged restraint stress, mRNA levels of MOR and DOR decreased in the NPO and in the head kidney. Increased expression of all studied opioid receptors was observed in the pituitary pars distalis (containing ACTH-producing cells). In immune organs, constitutive but lower expression of opioid receptor genes was observed. During in vivo zymosan-induced peritonitis or after in vitro LPS-induced stimulation, when pro-inflammatory functions are activated, expression of the OR genes in leukocytes was concomitantly up-regulated. Additionally, specific agonists of opioid receptors especially reduced leukocyte migratory properties, manifested by reduced chemotaxis and down-regulated expression of chemokine receptors. Our data indicate an evolutionary conserved role for the opioid system in maintaining a dynamic equilibrium while coping with stress and/or infection.
We evaluated the contribution of peroxynitrite to the fatal cardiovascular depression induced by overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) after activation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the origin of sympathetic vasomotor tone. In Sprague-Dawley rats maintained under propofol anesthesia, microinjection of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bilaterally into the RVLM elicited significant hypotension, bradycardia, reduction in sympathetic vasomotor tone and mortality. There was also a discernible elevation of iNOS expression in the ventrolateral medulla, followed by a massive production of nitrotyrosine, an experimental index for peroxynitrite. Co-administration bilaterally into the RVLM of the selective iNOS inhibitor, S-methylisothiourea (50, 100 or 250 pmol), an active peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis- (N-methyl-4'-pyridyl)-porphyrinato iron (III) (10 or 50 pmol), a peroxynitrite scavenger, L-cysteine (5, 50 or 100 pmol), or a superoxide dismutase mimetic, Mn(III)-tetrakis-(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (1 or 10 pmol), significantly prevented mortality, reduced nitrotyrosine production and reversed the NO-induced cardiovascular suppression after application of LPS into the RVLM. We conclude that the formation of peroxynitrite by a reaction between superoxide anion and NO is primarily responsible for the fatal cardiovascular depression induced by overproduction of NO after activation of iNOS at the RVLM.
Methamphetamine (METH)-induced neurotoxicity to nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in experimental animals appears to have a glutamatergic component because blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors prevents the neuropathologic consequences. Because adenosine affords neuroprotection against various forms of glutamate-mediated neuronal damage, the present studies were performed to investigate whether adenosine plays a protective role in METH-induced toxicity. METH-induced decrements in neostriatal dopamine content and tyrosine hydroxylase activity in mice were potentiated by concurrent treatment with caffeine, a nonselective adenosine antagonist that blocks both A1 and A2 adenosine receptors. In contrast, chronic treatment of mice with caffeine through their drinking water for 4 weeks, which increased the number of adenosine A1 receptors in the neostriatum and frontal cortex, followed by drug washout, prevented the neurochemical changes produced by the treatment of mice with METH treatment. In contrast, this treatment did not prevent 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Furthermore, concurrent administration of cyclopentyladenosine, an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, attenuated the METH-induced neurochemical changes. This protection by cyclopentyladenosine was blocked by cyclopentyltheophylline, an A1 receptor antagonist. These results indicate that activation of A1 receptors can protect against METH-induced neurotoxicity in mice.
Paraquat poisoning has been a public health problem in both the developing and developed countries. Pentraxin 3 is a member of the pentraxin family which is expressed as part of the acute-phase response that begins after injury, trauma, and infection. The aim of our study is to determine whether PTX3 levels can be a significant marker of pulmonary fibrosis and outcome of survival in paraquat poisoning. To measure the plasma paraquat level, we collected serum of the patients immediately after admission. EDTA plasma samples for checking the plasma PTX3 concentration were taken before and after the 1st hemoperfusion and after the 2nd hemoperfusion therapy. PTX3 concentrations in EDTA plasma were determined using a commercial solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Plasma paraquat concentration was higher in survivors than in non-survivors (p<0.05). Maximal plasma PTX3 level was significantly higher in the pulmonary fibrosis group, and plasma PTX3 was significantly increased throughout hemoperfusion therapy (p<0.01). Moreover, increase in PTX3 was greater in non-survivors than survivors (p<0.05). Our results show that PTX3 is a useful biomarker of severity and outcome predictor in paraquat poisoning.
Male albino rabbits were exposed to the organochlorinated pesticides hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and endosulfan (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, ip) twice a week for 12 mo. The mean body weight of the rabbits at 12 mo was lower than that of the controls. There was rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Electrocardiograms (ECG) in both the exposed groups showed increases in PR, QT and RR intervals. Extensive myocardial damage was recorded with marked degeneration of muscle fibers vacuolization and leucocytic infiltration. Adrenals had thickened capsules and hyperplasia of cortical cells. Both pesticides produced significant increases (p less than 0.001) of 11-hydroxycortisone at all time intervals. Hypertension and myocarditis occurred in rabbits exposed to HCH and endosulfan.
To study the effect of Scutellarein (Scu) on the diabetic rat aorta.
Contractile responses to phenylepherine and endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to acetylcholine (ACh) in rat aorta were investigated after streptozocin-induced 6-wk diabetes, Scu-treated streptozocin-induced diabetes, and in age-matched control in vitro.
1) Endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh in diabetic rats was decreased (P < 0.01) compared with age-matched control. 2) Contractile responses to phenylepherine were increased (P < 0.01) in diabetic rats. 3) The dietary supplement of 0.5% Scu starting from 1-wk diabetes induction prevented endothelial dysfunction (P < 0.01), but the contractile responses to phenylepherine were further increased.
Scu prevented vascular endothelial dysfunction in diabetic rats, and also potentiated the contraction induced by phenylepherine.
The clinical characteristics of psychiatric side effects of bromocriptine in patients with Parkinson's disease were studied in 12 cases. The clinical picture was characterized by hallucinations and delirium. Daily doses of bromocriptine (more than 30 mg daily), not duration of the disease or pretreatment with levodopa or previous psychiatric diseases, appeared to be the most important causal factor.
The myelotoxicity of five endocrine active chemicals was evaluated in F1 generation of Sprague-Dawley rats following developmental and adult exposures at three concentration levels. Rats were exposed to genistein (GEN: 25, 250 and 1250 ppm), nonylphenol (NPH: 25, 500 and 2000 ppm), methoxychlor (MXC: 10, 100 and 1000 ppm), vinclozolin (VCZ: 10, 150 and 750 ppm) and ethinyl estradiol (EE2: 5, 25 and 200 ppb) gestationally and lactationally through dams from day 7 of gestation and through feed after weaning on postnatal day (PND) 22 to PND 64. The parameters examined included the number of recovered bone marrow cells, DNA synthesis, and colony forming units (CFU) in the presence of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and erythropoietin. Except for the EE2, the concentrations of other individual chemicals in the diet were in an approximate range that allowed for a comparison to be made in terms of myelotoxic potency. Decreases in the DNA synthesis, CFU-GM and CFU-M seemed to be the common findings among the alterations induced by these compounds. Using the numbers of alterations induced by each chemical in the parameters examined as criteria for comparison, the order of myelotoxic potency in F(1) males was: GEN>MXC>NPH>VCZ; the order in females: GEN>NPH>VCZ. Additionally, some of the functional changes induced by these compounds were gender-specific or dimorphic. Overall, the results demonstrated that developmental and adult exposures of F1 rats to these endocrine active chemicals at the concentrations tested had varied degrees of myelotoxicity with GEN being the most potent. Furthermore, the sex-specific effects of these chemicals in F1 male and female rats suggest that there may be interactions between these compounds and sex hormone in modulating these responses.
Estradiol (E(2)) stimulates colonization of the vagina by Candida albicans. Although this yeast expresses an estrogen-binding protein (EBP), the cellular target for estrogenic modulation of this infection is unresolved. Findings support direct E(2)-induced C. albicans growth as well as indirect effects via E(2)-induced changes in the vaginal epithelium. Our primary goal was to pursue the issue of direct versus indirect estrogen action on vaginal candidiasis using diethylstilbestrol (DES), an efficacious mammalian estrogen receptor agonist, which exhibits no detectable affinity for the EBP of C. albicans.
We used both in vitro and in vivo experimentation with an EBP-positive strain of C. albicans isolated from the human vagina. Ligand-binding studies were performed with steroidal and nonsteroidal estrogens and anti-estrogens using the soluble EBP from both the yeast and the rat uterus. Mature ovariectomized rats were treated with either E(2) or DES for 7 days before and after C. albicans inoculation into the vaginas. Subsequent estrogen-sensitive colonization was quantified based on cultures of vaginal homogenates on Sabouraud dextrose (SD) agar pour plates.
We confirmed that our isolate of C. albicans contained a high-affinity EBP, with no detectable affinity for DES. Vaginal colonization by C. albicans was 8.6-fold greater in response to in vivo treatment with E(2) than with the comparable dose regimen of DES.
The mechanism for estrogen-sensitive vaginal colonization by C. albicans includes a functional ligand-EBP interaction within the yeast.
Arginase has been suggested to compete with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) for their common substrate, l-arginine. To study the mechanisms underlying this interaction, we compared arginase expression in isolated airways and the consequences of inhibiting arginase activity in vivo with NO production, lung inflammation, and lung function in both C57BL/6 and NOS2 knockout mice undergoing ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation, a mouse model of asthma. Arginases I and II were measured by western blot in isolated airways from sensitized C57BL/6 mice exposed to ovalbumin aerosol. Physiological and biochemical responses - inflammation, lung compliance, airway hyperreactivity, exhaled NO concentration, arginine concentration - were compared with the responses of NOS2 knockout mice. NOS2 knockout mice had increased total cells in lung lavage, decreased lung compliance, and increased airway hyperreactivity. Both arginase I and arginase II were constitutively expressed in the airways of normal C57BL/6 mice. Arginase I was up-regulated approximately 8-fold in the airways of C57BL/6 mice exposed to ovalbumin. Expression of both arginase isoforms were significantly upregulated in NOS2 knockout mice exposed to ovalbumin, with about 40- and 4-fold increases in arginases I and II, respectively. Arginine concentration in isolated airways was not significantly different in any of the groups studied. Inhibition of arginase by systemic treatment of C57BL/6 mice with a competitive inhibitor, Nomega-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine (nor-NOHA), significantly decreased the lung inflammatory response to ovalbumin in these animals. We conclude that NOS2 knockout mice are more sensitive to ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation and its sequelae than are C57BL/6 mice, as determined by increased total cells in lung lavage, decreased lung compliance, and increased airway hyperreactivity, and that these findings are strongly correlated with increased expression of both arginase isoforms in the airways of the NOS2 knockout mice exposed to ovalbumin.
The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, (DMBA), targets and destroys all follicle types in rat and mouse ovaries. DMBA requires bioactivation to DMBA-3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide for ovotoxicity via formation of the intermediate, DMBA-3,4-diol (catalyzed by microsomal epoxide hydrolase; mEH). mEH was shown to be involved in DMBA bioactivation for ovotoxicity induction in B6C3F(1) mouse ovaries. The current study compared DMBA and DMBA-3,4-diol mediated ovotoxicity, and investigated mEH involvement in DMBA-3,4-diol bioactivation in Fischer 344 (F344) rat ovary. F344 postnatal day (PND) 4 rat ovaries were cultured in vehicle control or media containing 1) DMBA or DMBA-3,4-diol (12.5 nM - 1 muM; 15 days); 2) DMBA (1 muM; 6 h - 15 days); and 3) DMBA (1 muM) or DMBA-3,4-diol (75 nM)+/-the mEH activity inhibitor cyclohexene oxide (CHO; 2 mM; 4 days). Ovaries were histologically evaluated and mEH mRNA and protein were measured by reverse transcriptase PCR or Western blotting, respectively. Ovotoxicity following 15 days of culture occurred (P<0.05) at lower concentrations of DMBA-3,4-diol (12.5 nM - primordial; 75 nM - primary) than DMBA (75 nM - primordial; 375 nM - primary). The temporal pattern of mEH expression following DMBA exposure showed mRNA up-regulation (P<0.05) on day 2, with increased protein (P<0.05) on day 4, the earliest time of observed follicle loss (P<0.05). mEH inhibition prevented DMBA-induced, but not DMBA-3,4-diol-induced ovotoxicity. These results demonstrate a conserved response in mice and rats for ovarian mEH involvement in DMBA bioactivation to its ovotoxic, 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide form.
Tamoxifen (TAM), a non-steroidal anti-estrogen that is widely used in adjuvant therapy for all stages of breast carcinomas and in chemoprevention of high-risk group. The hepatic estrogenic effect of TAM induces hypertriglyceridemia by reduced activity of lipolytic enzymes (LPL) on triglycerides. Coenzyme Q10 (Co Q10), riboflavin and niacin are proved to be potent antioxidant and protective agents against many diseases including cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In this context, the objective of the study is to find the effect of the combined modality of Co Q10 (100 mg), riboflavin (10 mg) and niacin (50 mg) with TAM (10 mg twice a day) on serum lipids and lipoprotein levels in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.
The vitamin supplementation with tamoxifen was given for a period of 90 days. Blood samples were collected at the base line, 45th and 90th day during the course of treatment. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), free cholesterol (FC), ester cholesterol (EC), phospholipids (PL), triglycerides (TGL), free fatty acids (FFA), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and very low density cholesterol (VLDL-C) were estimated in 78 untreated, only TAM-treated and combinatorialy treated group along with 46 age- and sex-matched controls.
Serum TGL and VLDL-C (p<0.001) were found to be significantly elevated and LDL-C (p<0.01), significantly reduced among TAM-treated patients as compared to the untreated breast cancer subjects. All the lipids and lipoprotein levels were found to be significantly altered in the untreated breast cancer patients when compared to their normal counterparts. All the lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities were reverted back to near normal levels on 90 days of treatment on combinatorial therapy.
The study figures the altered lipid and lipoprotein levels in the untreated and TAM-treated breast cancer patients. On combination therapy with Co Q10, riboflavin and niacin, it counteracts the tamoxifen-induced hyperlipidemia to normal levels.
Environmental exposure to metal appears to enhance susceptibility to Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs); however, published data are not conclusive. The current study focuses on assessing the effects of copper depletion and/or manganese enhancement in the diet on susceptibility to Scrapie and this disease progression. The degree of spongiosis was the highest in the animals that received a copper- depleted diet. These observations suggest that this diet contributes to the Scrapie lesions and to the worsening of the condition in animals that have been inoculated with Scrapie. The highest intensities of GFAP immunostaining were also associated with the copper- depleted diet. Dietary supplementation with manganese had a negative effect on neuronal counts. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that certain environmental factors may aggravate neuropathological Scrapie lesions. This is consistent with reports from other neurodegenerative diseases where some metalloenzymes play a pivotal protector role against the oxidative stress associated with pathogenesis.
Whereas the smoking prevalence rates in the general population are declining, rates among people diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) continue to be elevated. Previous research has shown that nicotine may improve attention and mood, suggesting that nicotine may help ameliorate the attentional and emotional problems associated with ADHD. The present study examined the effects of nicotine with and without stimulant medication on ADHD symptoms, moods, and arousal in the everyday lives of smokers with ADHD. A total of 10 smokers with ADHD who were being treated with stimulant medication were asked to abstain from smoking while participating in the study. Participants underwent four conditions in randomized order: (a) Nicotine patch+stimulant medication, (b) nicotine patch only, (c) placebo patch+stimulant medication, and (d) placebo patch only. Each condition continued for 2 days, during which self-reports of ADHD symptoms and moods were obtained using electronic diaries. Lightweight ambulatory monitors recorded cardiovascular activity at each diary entry. Smoking abstinence was verified by expired carbon monoxide and salivary cotinine analysis. Results showed that nicotine patches and stimulant medication alone and in combination reduced difficulty concentrating and core ADHD symptoms compared with placebo patch only. Borderline improvement in impatience and self-control was seen with nicotine patch administration primarily on day 1. Nicotine patches also tended to elevate systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with placebo patch during day 2. The findings suggest that smokers with ADHD experience nicotine-related reductions in ADHD symptoms during their everyday lives.
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-paclitaxel has a unique pharmacokinetic profile that allows high concentrations of paclitaxel to be delivered to melanoma cells for prolonged periods compared with paclitaxel. We investigated the response rate and safety of weekly DHA-paclitaxel in metastatic melanoma patients. We enrolled chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic nonchoroidal melanoma using the two-stage Fleming design. At least one response was needed in the first stage to proceed to the second stage. DHA-paclitaxel (500 mg/m/week by 1-h intravenous infusion) was administered for 5 weeks every 6-week cycle until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or treatment refusal. Response and toxicity were assessed every 6 weeks and weekly, respectively. Thirty patients were enrolled. The patients' median age was 67 years (range: 29-86 years). The median number of treatment cycles was 2 (range: 1-6 cycles). Three patients (10%) had partial responses; one lasted 4 months, and two lasted 5.6 months. Fifteen patients (50%) had stable disease with a median duration of 2.8 months (range: 2.6-8.9 months). The median survival was 14.8 months. Neutropenia (10%) and musculoskeletal pain (10%) were the most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities, and fatigue (73%), skin rash (70%), and diarrhea (60%) were the most common side effects. As a single-agent therapy, DHA-paclitaxel was well tolerated in metastatic melanoma patients. Its efficacy as a first-line therapy for metastatic melanoma does not exceed that seen with other single-agent chemotherapies such as dacarbazine. Further evaluation of DHA-paclitaxel in combination with other chemotherapy or targeted agents could be considered.
Epidemiological investigations have revealed that sulfur dioxide (SO(2) ) exposure is linked to cardiovascular diseases. The present study was designed to investigate the negative inotropic effects of gaseous SO(2) and its derivatives in the isolated perfused rat heart and the possible mechanisms involved in their effects. The results showed that both SO(2) and SO(2) derivatives elicited a negative inotropic effect in a dose-dependent manner, and SO(2) produced a higher negative effect than SO(2) derivatives. The mechanism of SO(2) -induced negative inotropic effects at low concentrations was different from that at high concentrations. At low concentrations, the mechanism of SO(2) -induced negative inotropic effects might occur through promoting the activities of protein kinase C (PKC), cycloxygenase, and cGMP, while the mechanism of SO(2) derivatives-induced effects might be related to the opening of ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP) ) channel and the inhibition of Ca(2+) influx via L-type calcium-channel. At high concentrations, the mechanisms of SO(2) and SO(2) derivatives-induced negative inotropic effects were similar, which might be related to the K(ATP) channel and L-type calcium-channel as well as the possible alterations in PKC, cycloxygenase, and cGMP. Further work is needed to determine the relative contribution of each pathway in SO(2) -mediated inotropic effect.
Lithium tremor is an irregular, nonrhythmic tremor of the distal extremities, variable in both intensity and frequency. It is clinically differentiated from essential tremor and tremors due to anxiety and neuroleptics. The pathophysiologic mechanisms are hypothesized to be of perpheral origin. Five patients were successfully treated with propranolol. In general, the dosage of propranolol must be individually adjusted and is usually from 30 to 40 mg daily in divided doses. This blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors remains effective with long-term administration and increases in dosage are not required.
Cocaine is a drug with distribution and consumption throughout the world. Its consumption extended mainly in the decades 1980-1990. The drugs produces cardiovascular effects following chronic administration and overdose, due to their potent vasoconstrictor effect secondary to the increase of synaptic concentrations of the monamine neurotransmitter dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin by binding to transporter proteins and blocking reuptake. Renal insufficiency due to rhabdomyolysis, and cardiovascular dysfunction have been reported following cocaine abuse, and may be fatal. We report a patient who developed renal insufficiency due to rhabdomyolysis and a cardiovascular disorder associated with cocaine abuse. We review the disorders induced by cocaine abuse and their treatment.
The authors observed 9 patients submitted to prophylactic treatment with adequately doses subcutaneous heparin, for orthopaedic or traumatic surgery (chiefly total hip arthroplasty) who presented between the 7 and 9 day after starting heparin therapy, thrombotic complications including recurrent arterial occlusions and venous thrombosis associated with a profound thrombocytopenia, with a maximum platelet count below 30,000 per cubic millimeter. A rapid increase of platelet count after heparin withdrawal is observed, and the profound thrombocytopenia seems to be immune mediated with heparin dependent platelet antibodies, in most of the reported cases. We propose a platelet count for all surgical patients with heparin therapy, and if a thrombocytopenia appears, with a platelet count in the range of: 80,000 clinical inspection and platelet aggregation investigations, and immediate cessation of heparin therapy at 30,000 platelets/mm3.
Few studies have examined the relationship between long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nonaccidental mortality in rural populations.
We examined the relationship between PM2.5 and nonaccidental and cardiovascular mortality in the U.S. Agricultural Health Study cohort.
The cohort (n = 83,378) included farmers, their spouses, and commercial pesticide applicators residing primarily in Iowa and North Carolina. Deaths occurring between enrollment (1993-1997) and 30 December 2009 were identified by record linkage. Six-year average (2001-2006) remote-sensing derived estimates of PM2.5 were assigned to participants' residences at enrollment, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) in relation to a 10-μg/m(3) increase in PM2.5 adjusted for individual-level covariates.
In total, 5,931 nonaccidental and 1,967 cardiovascular deaths occurred over a median follow-up time of 13.9 years. PM2.5 was not associated with nonaccidental mortality in the cohort as a whole (HR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.20), but consistent inverse relationships were observed among women. Positive associations were observed between ambient PM2.5 and cardiovascular mortality among men, and these associations were strongest among men who did not move from their enrollment address (HR = 1.63; 95% 0.94, 2.84). In particular, cardiovascular mortality risk in men was significantly increased when analyses were limited to nonmoving participants with the most precise exposure geocoding (HR = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.04, 3.36).
Rural PM2.5 may be associated with cardiovascular mortality in men; however, similar associations were not observed among women. Further evaluation is required to explore these sex differences.
Apart from its importance as an acid secretogogue, the role of histamine as a downstream target of gastrin has not been fully explored. Previous studies have shown that the combination of hypergastrinemia and Helicobacter infection resulted in accelerated gastric cancer in mice. We used this model to examine the role of cholecystokinin 2 (CCK2)/gastrin receptor and histamine H2-receptor signaling in the development of gastric atrophy and cancer.
Male hypergastrinemic mice (INS-GAS mice) were infected with Helicobacter felis and given the CCK2/gastrin receptor antagonist YF476 and/or the histamine H2-receptor antagonist loxtidine for 3 or 6 months. In addition, mice were treated with omeprazole alone or in combination with either YF476 or loxtidine for 3 months.
Mice treated with YF476 or loxtidine alone showed partial suppression of both gastric acid secretion and progression to neoplasia. The combination of YF476 plus loxtidine treatment resulted in nearly complete inhibition of both parameters. YF476 and/or loxtidine treatment did not alter the overall level of H. felis colonization but did result in significant down-regulation of the growth factors regenerating gene I and amphiregulin. Loxtidine treatment, with or without YF476, induced a mild shift in T-helper cell polarization. In contrast, omeprazole treatment resulted in mild progression of gastric hyperplasia/dysplasia, which was ameliorated by the addition of YF476 or loxtidine.
The combination of CCK2/gastrin- and histamine H2-receptor antagonists has synergistic inhibitory effects on development of gastric atrophy and cancer in H. felis/INS-GAS mice, while the proton pump inhibitor showed no such effects. These results support an important role for the gastrin-histamine axis in Helicobacter-induced gastric carcinogenesis.
