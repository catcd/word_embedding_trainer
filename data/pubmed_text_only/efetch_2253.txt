Three cases of hepatocellular carcinoma are reported in young men who had been taking androgenic-anabolic steroids. The tumours were histologically similar to those described in previous reports. The tumour progressed slowly in two patients during four and seven years of observation, but in the latter bony metastases occurred. In two patients the tumours regressed after administration of the drug was discontinued. These cases strengthen the evidence that exogenous androgenic-anabolic steroids may produce liver tumours. The use of these drugs should be confined to serious conditions in which they are known to be effective. Biochemical tests of liver function and serum alphs-fetoprotein estimation are not useful as screening-tests for hepatoma in patients taking androgens, and regular isotopic liver-scanning is recommended.
Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) has been associated with the advent of asbestos-associated apoptosis and proliferation in mesothelial and alveolar epithelial cells and may be linked to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. The objective of studies here was to characterize the development of inflammation, cellular proliferation, and fibrosis in asbestos-exposed C57Bl/6 mice in relationship to patterns of ERK phosphorylation. Inflammation occurred after 10 and 20 days of asbestos exposure as evidenced by increases in total protein and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Increases in cell proliferation were observed at 30 days in bronchiolar epithelia and at 4, 14, and 30 days in the alveolar compartment of the lung. Trichrome-positive focal lesions of pulmonary fibrosis developed at 30 days in the absence of elevations in lung hydroxyproline or procollagen mRNA levels. Striking increases in ERK phosphorylation were observed within pulmonary epithelial cells at sites of developing fibrotic lesions after 14 and 30 days of inhalation. In addition to characterizing a murine inhalation model of asbestosis, we provide the first evidence showing activation of ERK signaling within lung epithelium in vivo, following inhalation of asbestos fibers.
Anthracyclines, found to be efficacious in the treatment of a broad spectrum of pediatric malignancies, are cardiotoxic and may lead to heart failure even a long time after successful treatment of cancer. It is thought that subtle abnormalities can progress to the more permanent myocardial disease, resulting in cardiomyopathy which may progress to congestive heart failure. There are some precipitating factors leading to the sudden onset of cardiac symptoms such as increase in afterload or preload. We describe a young patient with congestive heart failure treated with doxorubicin (cumulative mean dose 420 mg/m2) in infancy because of pelvic sarcoma in whom the appearance of symptoms was related to pulmonary embolism. Four years before hospital admission, the patient presented echocardiographic abnormalities such as left ventricular fractional shortening and thickness reduction and he was treated with ACE-inhibitors. The myocardial ischemia, which is present in pulmonary embolism, probably worsened the left ventricular systolic function and caused congestive heart failure.
Cardiac toxicity has been associated with HIV infection and exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), but the role of the latter in the development of cardiac disease of HIV-infected patients is uncertain. To investigate the cardiotoxicity of transplacentally administered zidovudine (AZT) or AZT plus lamivudine (3TC) in the absence of HIV infection, we evaluated several biomarkers of cardiac mitochondrial structure and cardiac structure and function in a B6C3F1 mouse model. In utero exposure to AZT-3TC resulted in ultrastructural pathology, loss of mitochondria, and altered echocardiographic measurements in newborn mice. Cardiac pathology and dysfunction persisted into the adult life of female mice exposed in utero to AZT, as evidenced by significant dose-dependent heart enlargement, clusters of atypical mitochondria and myofibril alterations, significantly increased cytochrome c oxidase activity, and significantly higher numbers of mutations in mitochondrial tRNA genes compared with unexposed controls at 18 to 24 mo of age. These data led to the hypothesis that the long-term pathology of peri-natal exposure to these NRTIs is related to persistent mitochondrial DNA mutations in cardiac tissue; that is, the primary damage during drug treatment is mutational (as opposed to affecting polymerase gamma and/or other mitochondrial elements) and leads over time to delayed, progressive cardiotoxicity.
Treatment of HIV with AZT (zidovudine) may have toxic side effects as a result of multiple mechanisms. It is known that patients with AIDS may suffer from magnesium deficiency (MgD). We studied selected biochemical and histopathologic consequences of AZT administration (0.7 mg/mL in drinking water) with concurrent Mg-deficient (20% of normal) diet in male C57Bl/6N mice for 3 wk. Significant decreases in red blood cell glutathione (GSH) were evident in the Mg-deficient mice with or without AZT treatment, suggesting compromised antioxidant capacity in the blood. Although MgD alone led to a 1.9-fold increase in plasma thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2), derived from the highly vasoconstrictive TXA(2)), AZT + MgD increased the TXB(2) level 3.5-fold. AZT (+/-MgD) provoked prominent hepatic damage expressed by distortion of lobular architecture, nuclear and cellular swelling, and inflammatory lesions and loss of hepatocytes. AZT alone caused mild cardiac lesions, resulting in partial cardiac fibrosis, especially in the atrium. AZT + MgD caused only scattered small-size cardiac lesions consisting of microscopic foci of inflammatory infiltrates in the ventricles but led to more prominent lesions, fibrosis, and scars in the atrium. MgD or AZT alone caused varying degrees of skeletal muscle degeneration; in combination, more intense degeneration and regeneration of muscle cells were evident. In conclusion, it is suggested that both the decreased blood GSH and elevated plasma TXA(2) might contribute, at least in part, to the aggravated pathological damages observed in the atrium and skeletal muscle of the AZT-treated Mg-deficient mice.
A case of herpes simplex encephalitis in a previously healthy 17-month-old girl relapsing 1 week after completion of a 10-day acyclovir therapy is described. The child responded favourably to a second 10-day course with acyclovir. The time of relapse and the satisfactory response to a second course of acyclovir treatment indicate that the first course of therapy was inadequate for eradication of herpes simplex virus infection.
Age-related osteoblast dysfunction is the main cause of age-related bone loss in both men and women. In the present study, the effect of sciadopitysin, a type of biflavonoids, on osteoblast function was investigated in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Sciadopitysin caused a significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen synthesis, osteocalcin production, mineralization, and glutathione content in the cells (P<0.05). Sciadopitysin also decreased the production of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-Î±) induced by antimycin A, a mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor. We investigated the protective effects of sciadopitysin on antimycin A-induced toxicity in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Exposure of MC3T3-E1 cells to antimycin A caused a significant reduction in osteoblast dysfunction. However, pretreatment with sciadopitysin prior to antimycin A exposure significantly reduced antimycin A-induced cell damage by preventing mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) loss, reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, and nitrotyrosine increase, suggesting that sciadopitysin may be useful for protecting mitochondria against a burst of oxidative stress. Moreover, sciadopitysin increased phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) inhibited by antimycin A. Our results demonstrate that sciadopitysin may reduce or prevent osteoblasts degeneration.
Quinine-induced immune thrombocytopenia with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a recently defined clinical entity. In this paper we have attempted to characterize the natural history and laboratory abnormalities typical of quinine-induced immune thrombocytopenia associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome in nine patients experiencing ten episodes of the disease. In addition, review of other reported cases of probable quinine-induced HUS is presented. The disease was characterized by the onset of chills, diapheresis, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased urine output, and petechiae following quinine exposure. All patients experience significant anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase, elevated serum creatinine, and oliguria. Quinine-dependent platelet-reactive antibodies were identified in eight of nine using flow cytometry. Unexpectedly, drug-dependent antibodies reactive with red cells and granulocytes were identified in four and eight patients, respectively. All patients were treated with plasma exchange (range 1-12 procedures), and seven required hemodialysis. All survive without residual abnormality. Our experience with nine patients with quinine-induced HUS and the nine additional cases reported by others and reviewed in this paper establishes this condition as a distinct clinical entity. Adult patients presenting with HUS should routinely be asked about exposure to quinine in the form of medication or beverages. The mechanism by which quinine-dependent antibodies produce renal failure is uncertain, but preliminary studies (described elsewhere) suggest that drug-induced antibodies reactive with endothelial cells and possibly margination of granulocytes in renal glomeruli may be responsible for this complication. The prognosis in quinine-induced HUS is better than in other forms of adult HUS.
Botulinum toxin-induced paralysis of neuromuscular transmission involves at least three steps. There is an initial binding step that is nontoxic, a translocation step that is nontoxic and a subsequent lytic step that produces blockade of transmission. In the absence of nerve stimulation, the binding step has a half-time of similar to or approximately 12 min and a rate constant of similar to or approximately 0.058 . min-1. The binding step does not require calcium or nerve stimulation, and it has a low temperature dependence (Q10 similar to or approximately 1.6). In the absence of nerve stimulation, the translocation step has a half-time of similar to or approximately 4.9 min and a rate constant of similar to or approximately 0.141 . min-1. Translocation requires physiological concentrations of calcium. In the virtual absence of nerve stimulation (1 x 10(-2) Hz), the lytic step has a half-time of similar to or approximately 55 min and a rate constant of similar to or approximately 0.013 . min-1. The lytic step requires calcium, is facillitated by nerve stimulation and has a high temperature dependence by nerve stimulation and has a high temperature dependence (Q10 similar to or approximately 4.2). These data are used to propose a model for botulinum toxin interaction with the cholinergic nerve terminal.
The anti-inflammatory effects of glycyrol, a benzofuran coumarin isolated from Glycyrrhizae Radix, were studied. Glycyrol of 5, 25 and 50 microM dose-dependently inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production by down-regulating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and alleviated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages, in both the mRNA and the protein. Furthermore, glycyrol dose-dependently decreased the mRNA of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6. LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation was prevented in RAW264.7 macrophages by inhibition of I-kappaBalpha phosphorylation. In addition, administration of glycyrol (30 and 100 mg/kg, i.p) reduced the thickness of carrageenan-induced mouse-paw edema swelling. Taken together, our results indicate that glycyrol is an important anti-inflammatory constituent of Glycyrrhizae Radix, and that its anti-inflammatory effect is attributed to the inhibition I-kappaBalpha phosphorylation.
Environmental toxicants have been shown to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease, including testis disease and male infertility. The current study was designed to determine the impact of an altered sperm epigenome on the subsequent development of an adult somatic cell (Sertoli cell) that influences the onset of a specific disease (male infertility). A gestating female rat (F0 generation) was exposed to the agriculture fungicide vinclozolin during gonadal sex determination and then the subsequent F3 generation progeny used for the isolation of Sertoli cells and assessment of testis disease. As previously observed, enhanced spermatogenic cell apoptosis was observed. The Sertoli cells provide the physical and nutritional support for the spermatogenic cells. Over 400 genes were differentially expressed in the F3 generation control versus vinclozolin lineage Sertoli cells. A number of specific cellular pathways were identified to be transgenerationally altered. One of the key metabolic processes affected was pyruvate/lactate production that is directly linked to spermatogenic cell viability. The Sertoli cell epigenome was also altered with over 100 promoter differential DNA methylation regions (DMR) modified. The genomic features and overlap with the sperm DMR were investigated. Observations demonstrate that the transgenerational sperm epigenetic alterations subsequently alters the development of a specific somatic cell (Sertoli cell) epigenome and transcriptome that correlates with adult onset disease (male infertility). The environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of testis disease appears to be a component of the molecular etiology of male infertility.
Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) induced macrophage cell death and its mechanism remains to be solved. Herein, we report that ZnO NPs induced ROS generation by depleting antioxidant enzymes, increasing lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl contents in macrophages. The oxidative stress was induced by the inhibition of Nrf2 transcription factor release. ZnO NPs also activated the cleavage of apoptosis markers like caspases 3, 8 and 9. Î³H2Ax activation and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) that are known indicators of genotoxicity were found to be activated by following p53, p21/waf1 signaling. ZnO NPs increased the number of autophagosomes and autophagy marker proteins such as microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-isoform II (MAP-LC3-II) and Beclin 1 after 0.5-24h of treatment. Phosphorylated Akt, PI3K and mTOR were significantly decreased on ZnO NPs exposure. Moreover, the apoptotic and autophagic cell death could be inhibited on blocking of ROS generation by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) which demonstrated the critical role of ROS in both types of cell death. In addition, inhibition of LC3-II by siRNA-dependent knockdown attenuated the cleavage of caspase 3. This study demonstrates autophagy supports apoptosis on ZnO NPs exposure.
The cytotoxic effects and the induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) by Fludarabine (FLU), 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA), and deoxycoformycin (DCF) with/without alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) were evaluated in vitro against freshly isolated B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. Cytotoxicity was evaluated according to the soluble tetrazolium/formazan assay. Regarding the cytotoxicity, FLU, 2-CdA, and DCF showed a mean antitumor activity of 45% +/- 3.39 (mean +/- S.D.), 55% +/- 4.72, and 20% +/- 3.16, respectively. alpha-IFN alone showed a mean cytotoxic activity of 10% +/- 2.72. The cytotoxicity of these purine analogues in combination with alpha-IFN was 52% +/- 2.97, 75% +/- 3.41, and 26% +/- 7.09, respectively. We observed a statistically significant increase of cytotoxicity compared to controls in FLU alone (P < 0.05), 2-CdA (P < 0.05), and their combination with alpha-IFN (P < 0.05). Apoptosis was evaluated by electrophoresis gel of DNA oligonucleosomal fragments and by a cytofluorimetric method. Only FLU and 2-CdA activated the apoptosis and DCF showed a minor apoptotic pathway amount. These apoptosis data were confirmed by both gel electrophoresis of DNA and by propidium iodide cytofluorimetric method. FLU and 2-CdA show activity in B-CLL cells by direct cytotoxic action and the induction of cell death by apoptosis; in the future, it would be interesting to utilize these in vitro assays in monitoring chemosensitivity and predicting response for the clinical use.
Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is an autosomal recessive defect of purine metabolism. Succinyladenosine (S-Ado) and succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) are the disease marker metabolites in physiological fluids. The Bratton-Marshall test for detection of SAICAr in urine has been added to the selective screening for inborn errors of metabolism that is carried out in our lab. During the last three years, around 2,000 patients have been screened by this method, resulting in the detection of four new cases with this disease. They all presented with severe psychomotor delay, hypotonia and refractory epilepsy since the neonatal period. The S-Ado/SAICAr ratio in cerebrospinal fluid was below 2, indicating that they correspond to the most severe form of the disease. New missense mutations were found in a heterozygous fashion in three patients. The study of purines in all patients with neurological disease of unknown etiology is highly recommended.
A 2-week-old premature child with congenital glaucoma secondary to anterior cleavage syndrome was treated with timolol maleate and cyclocryotherapy. The patient had apneic spells of up to 30 seconds that stopped soon after timolol maleate therapy was discontinued. No apnea was seen before timolol maleate administration, and no further spells were noted after subsequent cyclocryotherapy without timolol maleate treatment. Possible central nervous system toxicity of timol maleate or its metabolic by-products in neonates with immature blood-brain barriers was noted.
PIK3CA mutations are reported to be present in approximately 25% of breast cancer (BC), particularly the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and HER2-overexpressing (HER2+) subtypes, making them one of the most common genetic aberrations in BC. In experimental models, these mutations have been shown to activate AKT and induce oncogenic transformation, and hence these lesions have been hypothesized to render tumors highly sensitive to therapeutic PI3K/mTOR inhibition. By analyzing gene expression and protein data from nearly 1,800 human BCs, we report that a PIK3CA mutation-associated gene signature (PIK3CA-GS) derived from exon 20 (kinase domain) mutations was able to predict PIK3CA mutation status in two independent datasets, strongly suggesting a characteristic set of gene expression-induced changes. However, in ER+/HER2- BC despite pathway activation, PIK3CA mutations were associated with a phenotype of relatively low mTORC1 signaling and a good prognosis with tamoxifen monotherapy. The relationship between clinical outcome and the PIK3CA-GS was also assessed. Although the PIK3CA-GS was not associated with prognosis in ER- and HER2+ BC, it could identify better clinical outcomes in ER+/HER2- disease. In ER+ BC cell lines, PIK3CA mutations were also associated with sensitivity to tamoxifen. These findings could have important implications for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutant BCs and the development of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.
David Kupfer had a passion for drug metabolism and used his talents to understand the putative metabolic activation of the insecticides o, p'DDT and methoxychlor to estrogens. His research helped to create a scientific foundation for the current interest in endocrine disruption. With the increasing clinical significance of tamoxifen in the late 1980s, and the proposal to test tamoxifen as a breast cancer chemopreventive in healthy women, David initiated laboratory studies on the mechanisms of tamoxifen metabolism. He was the first to note that tamoxifen is metabolically activated to alkylating species. Tamoxifen and insecticides covalently bind to microsomal proteins. His contribution presaged worldwide studies of the induction of rat liver carcinogenesis by tamoxifen.
Cerebral vasospasm induced by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is still a leading cause of morbidity and death. This 50-year-old man underwent surgery for aneurysm clipping. After the aneurysm was clipped, papaverine was instilled into the surgical area. Bradycardia, hypotension, and sinus arrest developed in the first minute after applying the papaverine. Thus, the authors concluded that the application of papaverine to the surgical area can result in fatal bradycardia and hypotension.
Addition of PGE2, but not PGF2 alpha, to fetal lung organ cultures accelerates the process of self-differentiation with increased dilatation of terminal airsacs and differentiation of the epithelial lining. Indomethacin reduces the endogenous production by organ cultures of PGE2, PGF2 alpha, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2, and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2 alpha and retards the process of self-differentiation. Prolonged exposure of cultures to indomethacin results in cell necrosis. Indomethacin inhibition of self-differentiation can be reversed and accelerated by the addition of PGE2. Addition of PGF2 alpha in the presence of indomethacin prevents indomethacin-associated cell necrosis but does not accelerate dilatation or differentiation beyond that of cultures in sera-free media without additions. We propose that the endogenous production of PGE2 is a key process in the mechanism of self-differentiation of human fetal lung in organ culture.
Animal models of infection are very useful tools for identifying those situations in which antibacterial drugs, including the quinolones, may play special roles, i.e., for positioning a drug correctly for its role in the treatment of human disease. Ciprofloxacin has been studied extensively in discriminative animal models of infection, and its efficacy in the treatment of these infections has been compared with that of standard therapy. In a rabbit model of staphylococcal endocarditis, ciprofloxacin was as effective as nafcillin alone, as well as nafcillin and gentamicin in combination, in treating rabbits with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Additionally, its activity was equal to that of vancomycin in reducing vegetation titers in rabbits with methicillin-resistant staphylococcal endocarditis. In a rabbit model of pseudomonal meningitis, ciprofloxacin was as effective as the combination of ceftazidime and tobramycin in lowering bacterial titers. However, in this model, serum levels of ciprofloxacin (6 micrograms/ml) necessary to achieve a bactericidal effect in the cerebrospinal fluid were slightly higher than levels targeted for humans. In a model of pseudomonal pneumonia in neutropenic guinea pigs, the efficacy of ciprofloxacin was compared with that of tobramycin and ceftazidime, both alone and in combination: ciprofloxacin was as effective in lowering bacterial counts as was the combination of ceftazidime plus tobramycin and its activity was superior to that of either drug alone. Thus, data from studies of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of endocarditis, meningitis, and pneumonia in animal models of infection suggest that this quinolone may play an important role in the therapy of these difficult-to-manage infections in humans.
The alpha-methyl and alpha-ethyl analogs of methionine sulfoximine, like methionine sulfoximine, induce convulsions in mice and inhibit glutamine synthetase irreversibly; alpha-ethylmethionine sulfoximine is approximately 50% as inhibitory as methionine sulfoximine and alpha-methylmethionine sulfoximine. However, whereas alpha-methylmethionine sulfoximine and methionine sulfoximine inhibit gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase markedly, alpha-ethylmethionine sulfoximine does not, nor does administration of the alpha-ethyl analog produce the decrease in tissue glutathione levels found after giving methionine sulfoximine or its alpha-methyl analog. The findings strongly indicate that methionine sulfoximine-induced convulsions are closely associated with inhibition of glutamine synthetase rather than with inhibition of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. The alpha-alkyl methionine sulfoximine analogs cannot be catabolized via the corresponding alpha-keto or alpha-imino acids, and, like other alpha-substituted amino acids, are probably not metabolized to a significant extent in vivo; this suggests that the amino acid sulfoximine molecules themselves, rather than their metabolites, are directly involved in the induction of convulsions. Possible explanations for the reported lack of correlation between the occurrence of convulsions and the levels of glutamine synthetase activity (and its substrates and product) are considered. The findings suggest that studies on the mechanism of induction of convulsions may be extended significantly and refined in biochemical terms by the use of other structurally modified convulsant molecules.
Thirty adults with leukemia or lymphoma undergoing marrow transplantation from HLA-compatible unrelated donors received tacrolimus (FK506), a new immunosuppressive macrolide lactone, and minidose methotrexate to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The group had a median age of 36 years (range 21 to 49 years). Twenty-four patients had advanced disease, and 11 were resistant to conventional therapy. Tacrolimus was administered at 0.03 mg/kg/d intravenously (i.v.) by continuous infusion from day -2, converted to oral at four times the i.v. dose following engraftment, and continued through day 180 posttransplant. Methotrexate 5 mg/m2 was given i.v. on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. All patients engrafted. Grades 2-4 GVHD occurred in 34% (95% CI, 17% to 52%), and grades 3-4 GVHD in 17% (95% CI, 3% to 31%). Mild renal toxicity was common before day 100; 63% of patients had a doubling of creatinine, and 52% had a peak creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL, but only one patient was dialyzed. The median last i.v. dose of tacrolimus was 53% of the scheduled dose, and the median oral dose on day 100 was 41% of that scheduled. Overall survival at 1 year was 47% (95% CI, 27% to 66%). We conclude that tacrolimus can be combined safely with minidose methotrexate, and the combination has substantial activity in preventing acute GVHD after unrelated donor marrow transplantation.
Burn injury has been associated with systemic/compartmental inflammatory responses and myocardial dysfunction. We hypothesized that burn size correlates with the extent of cardiac inflammatory response/contractile dysfunction. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided to receive anesthesia, a 3-degree burn covering 20%, 30%, 40%, or 60% total body surface area (TBSA) plus fluid resuscitation (lactated Ringer, 4 mL/kg per percent burn); sham burn animals were included as controls. There were seven rats in each group. Rats were euthanized Twenty-four h postburn, and TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were measured in the plasma and in supernatant from isolated cardiac myocytes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, left ventricular function (Langendorff) was studied in vitro, and troponin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There were progressive, statistically significant increases in plasma and myocyte inflammatory cytokine levels, as well as plasma troponin with increasing burn size. Similarly, left ventricular pressure (in millimeters of mercury) and +/-dP/dtmax (in millimeters of mercury per second) progressively fell with increasing burn size. However, myocardial contractile depression induced by 60% TBSA burn was similar to that produced by 40% TBSA burn. These data suggest that the degree of inflammatory response, cardiac tissue injury, and myocardial contractile depression were correlated directly with the percent TBSA burn. However, unlike inflammation and cardiac tissue damage, myocardial contractile depression reached a plateau, with maximal myocardial contraction and relaxation defects observed at 40% TBSA burn, which were not further aggravated by a larger (60%) burn.
