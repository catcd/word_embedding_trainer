If neurotransmitter balance is upset in the developing nervous system by exposure to antidepressant drugs, structural and functional hedonic phenotypes of offspring may be affected. In order to test this hypothesis, two groups of pregnant Wistar dams were exposed to vehicle or fluoxetine by implantation on gestational day 14 of osmotic minipumps delivering 0 or 10 mg/kg/day fluoxetine for 14 days. The consequences of perinatal fluoxetine exposure on offspring conflict-exploratory behavior were quantified using the elevated plus-maze on postnatal day (PND) 30. Beginning on PND 60, the reinforcing properties of acutely administered cocaine were examined using a place conditioning procedure. Beginning on PND 90, a subset of rats were implanted with jugular catheters and allowed to acquire self-administration of cocaine in an operant environment. In support of the hedonic modulation hypothesis, perinatal fluoxetine produced a significant decline in both nucleus accumbens cell count (-9%) and serotonin transporter-like immunoreactivity in the raphe nucleus (-35%) on PND 120. In the elevated plus-maze, perinatal fluoxetine exposure decreased (-21%) overall activity. In the place conditioning trial, only the fluoxetine-treated group exhibited a significant place preference for the compartment paired previously with cocaine. In a cocaine self-administration extinction trial, there was a statistically significant increase (350%) in extinction response rate among fluoxetine-exposed offspring. These findings suggest that perinatal exposure to fluoxetine perturbs adult serotonergic neurotransmission and produces a positive hedonic shift for conditioned reinforcing effects of cocaine.
Mutations in the Notch1 receptor and delta-like 3 (Dll3) ligand cause global disruptions in axial segmental patterning. Genetic interactions between members of the notch pathway have previously been shown to cause patterning defects not observed in single gene disruptions. We examined Dll3-Notch1 compound mouse mutants to screen for potential gene interactions. While mice heterozygous at either locus appeared normal, 30% of Dll3-Notch1 double heterozygous animals exhibited localized, segmental anomalies similar to human congenital vertebral defects. Unexpectedly, double heterozygous mice also displayed statistically significant reduction of mandibular height and decreased length of the [corrected] maxillary hard palate. Examination of somite-stage embryos and perinatal anatomy and histology did not reveal any organ defects, so we used microarray-based analysis of Dll3 and Notch1 mutant embryos to identify gene targets that may be involved in notch-regulated segmental or craniofacial development. Thus, Dll3-Notch1 double heterozygous mice model human congenital scoliosis and craniofacial disorders.
Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with prominent anti-inflammatory properties. Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were randomized to receive either ketoprofen, 100 mg, three times a day (ketoprofen group, n = 9) or a weak NSAID, acetaminophen, 1 g, three times a day (acetaminophen group, n = 9) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH. Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively. Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first, third, and fifth postoperative mornings. Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 6 microM of adenosine diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen. Aggregation was lower (P < .05) in the ketoprofen group than in the acetaminophen group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day. In contrast, maximal platelet aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet aggregation results (P < .05). One patient in the ketoprofen group developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma. Coagulation (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [APPT], fibrinogen concentration, and antithrombin III [AT III]) was comparable between the two groups. Ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with SAH. If ketoprofen is used before surgery on cerebral artery aneurysms, it may pose an additional risk factor for hemorrhage.
The goal of this study was to quantitate changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal function during chronic increases in plasma levels of norepinephrine, and to determine the role of the renal pressure natriuresis mechanism in controlling sodium balance in norepinephrine hypertension. In six conscious dogs in which renal artery pressure (RAP) was allowed to increase during 7 days of norepinephrine infusion (0.2 micrograms/kg per min), sodium excretion (UNaV) rose from 66 +/- 3 to 112 +/- 15 mmol/day and MAP increased from 100 +/- 3 to 109 +/- 3 mmHg on the first day. On days 2-7, UNaV returned toward the control level while MAP averaged 108 +/- 2 mmHg. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) did not change significantly, averaging 85.9 +/- 4.0 and 235 +/- 17 ml/min, respectively, during 7 days of norepinephrine, compared to controls of 84.1 +/- 3.9 and 252 +/- 20 ml/min. When RAP was servo-controlled for 7 days during norepinephrine infusion, the natriuresis was abolished; UNaV averaged 76 +/- 8 during control, 77 +/- 13 during the first day of norepinephrine and 65 +/- 4 mmol/day during 7 days of norepinephrine. GFR and ERPF did not change significantly during norepinephrine infusion with RAP held constant. MAP did not reach a plateau but continued to rise from 102 +/- 3 to 137 +/- 3 mmHg after 7 days of norepinephrine and servo-control of RAP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake has key roles in cell life and death. Physiological Ca(2+) signaling regulates aerobic metabolism, whereas pathological Ca(2+) overload triggers cell death. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is mediated by the Ca(2+) uniporter complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which comprises MCU, a Ca(2+)-selective ion channel, and its regulator, MICU1. Here we report mutations of MICU1 in individuals with a disease phenotype characterized by proximal myopathy, learning difficulties and a progressive extrapyramidal movement disorder. In fibroblasts from subjects with MICU1 mutations, agonist-induced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake at low cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations was increased, and cytosolic Ca(2+) signals were reduced. Although resting mitochondrial membrane potential was unchanged in MICU1-deficient cells, the mitochondrial network was severely fragmented. Whereas the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophy and the core myopathies involves abnormal mitochondrial Ca(2+) handling, the phenotype associated with MICU1 deficiency is caused by a primary defect in mitochondrial Ca(2+) signaling, demonstrating the crucial role of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in humans.
Correlative morphological and biochemical studies were made on the adrenal of rats treated with daily subcutaneous injections of testosterone propionate in a dose of 50 mg/kg for 30 consecutive days. Histologically, there is a thinning of the zona fasciculata with a decrease of cell numbers, swelling of the cell body and the occurrence of large lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. Electron microscopic examination revealed swelling of mitochondria with reduction of cristae and hypertrophy of smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum with cluster formation or whirl-like arrangement. In in vitro biochemical experiments, it was noted that conversion of deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone or 18-hydroxydeoxy-corticosterone was decreased to 45% of the control level in the testosterone-treated group.
Focal myocarditis characterized by interstitial edema, round cell infiltration and fibrosis occurred in rats given a subcutaneous administration of testosterone propionate in a dose of 50 mg/kg for 30 consecutive days or longer. Biochemical analysis showed a two to five time increase of deoxycorticosterone and a moderate decrease of corticosterone in blood plasma of these rats as well as in those treated with 50 mg/kg of testosterone propionate for 15 days. It was also shown that myocarditis did not occur in adrenalectomized rats after administration of testosterone propionate 50 mg/kg for 30 days, while subcutaneous injections of deoxycorticosterone acetate in a dose of 15 mg/kg for 30 days invariably produced cardiac lesions in both adrenalectomized rats and sham-operated rats. Regarding species difference, administration of testosterone did not produced either a high blood level of deoxycorticosterone or focal myocarditis in guinea pigs or rabbits. From these results, it is concluded that focal myocarditis in rats after administration of large amounts of testosterone propionate is related to the elevation of deoxycorticosterone in blood plasma but not to the direct effects of testosterone propionate on the myocardium.
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene-positive lung cancer accounts for 4-5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. A clinical trial of the specific inhibitor of ALK fusion-type tyrosine kinase is currently under way.
ALK fusion gene products were analyzed immunohistochemically with the materials obtained by surgery or by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4(EML4)-ALK or kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B)-ALK translocation was confirmed by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). After eligibility criteria were met and informed consent was obtained, 3 patients were enrolled for the Pfizer Study of Crizotinib (PF02341066), Clinical Trial A8081001, conducted at Seoul National University.
Out of 404 cases, there were 14 of EML4-ALK non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) and one KIF5B-ALK NSCLC case (8 men, 7 women; mean age, 61.9 years, range 48-82). Except for 2 light smokers, all patients were non-smokers. All cases were of adenocarcinoma with papillary or acinar subtypes. Three were of stage IA, 5 of stage IIIA, 1 of stage IIIB and 6 of stage IV. Ten patients underwent thoracotomy, 3 received chemotherapy and 2 only best supportive care (BSC). One BSC and 2 chemotherapy cases were enrolled for the clinical trial. Patients with advanced stages who received chemotherapy or best supportive care were younger (54.0±6.3) than those who were surgically treated (65.8±10.1) (p<0.05). The powerful effect of ALK inhibitor on EML4-ALK NSCLC was observed. Soon after its administration, almost all the multiple bone and lymph node metastases quickly disappeared. Nausea, diarrhea and the persistence of a light image were the main side effects, but they diminished within a few months.
ALK-fusion gene was found in 3.7% (15/404) NSCLC cases and advanced disease with this fusion gene was correlated with younger generation. The ALK inhibitor presented in this study is effective in EML4-ALK NSCLC cases. A further study will be necessary to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this drug.
There is a need for new treatment strategies and prognostic markers for the management of malignant mesothelioma (MM). The activity of thalidomide/cisplatin/gemcitabine (arm A) or thalidomide alone (arm B) was investigated in two parallel phase II studies in patients with advanced MM, using 6 month progression free survival (PFS) as the principal end-point. The predictive role of pre-treatment and 8 week follow-up serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interlukin-6 (IL-6), interlukin-6 soluble receptor (sIL-6R), mesothelin (SMRP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was also assessed. The proportion of patients with stable disease for >6 months was similar in both studies (arm A 35%, arm B 29%) and toxicity was mainly grade I/II. In univariate analyses only pre-treatment VEGF and CRP were correlated with survival. At 8 weeks post treatment, increased survival was found with low (<median) VEGF and CRP compared with high (>median) VEGF and CRP (P<0.05). Change in VEGF over the first 8 weeks of treatment was also predictive for survival (P<0.05). When pre-treatment VEGF was >median, decreasing VEGF was associated with increased survival (P<0.05). In conclusion, thalidomide alone, or in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine, controlled disease for >6 months in ∼30% of patients. Patients with decreasing VEGF during treatment had longest survival. Pre-treatment VEGF or CRP and early change in VEGF on treatment may predict treatment benefit and should be examined in future studies.
We evaluated the association between drinking-water disinfection by-products and preterm births using improved exposure assessment and more appropriate analysis methods than used in prior studies.
During 1999-2001, vital record data were obtained for a large, racially diverse population residing in 27 Massachusetts communities that received drinking water from a single public utility. This water system was monitored weekly for total trihalomethanes (TTHM), and it maintained geographically stable total TTHM levels system-wide during the study period. We employed proportional hazards regression to examine the effects of trimester-specific and shorter-term peak exposures to TTHM in drinking water late in pregnancy on preterm births in 37,498 singletons.
For all women, our data suggested no more than a small increase, if any, in risk for delivering a preterm baby when exposed to > or = 60 microg/L TTHM during the 4 weeks before birth [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95-1.35]. However, women who depended on a governmental source of payment for prenatal care were at increased risk when exposed at such levels late in gestation (HR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06-1.81). In contrast, exposure to high levels of TTHM during the second trimester and high exposure throughout pregnancy resulted in a 15-18% reduction in risk for preterm delivery in our population.
This finding confirms previous reports of a negative association during the second trimester. Our data also suggested a possible positive association with shorter-term third-trimester TTHM exposure in mothers of lower socioeconomic status.
To investigate the frequency of cardiac valve regurgitation related with low dose dopamine agonists in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), echocardiograms were analyzed in 527 consecutive PD patients (448 patients treated with dopamine agonists, 79 patients never treated with dopamine agonists as age-matched controls). The frequency of mild or above mild regurgitation of the aortic valve (AR) was significantly higher in the cabergoline group (13.7%, P < 0.05) compared with the controls (2.5%). Odds ratio adjusted by age and sex for AR was significantly higher in the cabergoline group (OR, 6.45; 95% CI, 1.46-28.60; P = 0.01): odds ratio was significantly higher in patients treated with higher daily doses (OR, 14.41; 95% CI, 3.08-67.38; P = 0.0007) and higher cumulative doses (OR, 15.29; 95% CI, 3.19-73.18; P = 0.0006). No statistical difference was identified in the frequency of the tricuspid and mitral regurgitation. None of the other dopamine agonist groups including pergolide gave higher frequency or higher odds ratio compared with the controls. None of our patients showed severe regurgitation or was operated for valvular heart disease. The question as to whether or not longer duration of low dose dopamine agonist treatment would yield the same results needs further studies.
Seven-day proton pump inhibitor triple therapy is currently the treatment of choice for Helicobacter pylori infection. It is unclear whether triple therapy for less than 7 days might preserve efficacy while at the same time improving patient acceptability and compliance.
To evaluate the Helicobactericidal efficacy, ulcer healing capacity and patient acceptability of a 5-day lansoprazole-based triple therapy regimen.
Sixty-nine consecutive patients with H. pylori-positive peptic ulcer received lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily in combination with metronidazole 400 mg twice daily and clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 5 days. Ulcer healing medication was not continued after the 5-day regimen. H. pylori status was assessed before and at least 4 weeks after therapy by rapid urease test and histology. Adverse events and compliance were assessed by direct questioning.
All 69 patients attended for repeat endoscopy and 63 were H. pylori-negative after therapy giving a cure rate of 91%, (95%, Cl: 85-98%). Of the 59 patients with active ulcers, 58 were healed at repeat endoscopy giving an ulcer healing rate of 98% (95% Cl: 92-100%). All patients fully complied with therapy and mild adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal, were reported by 11 patients (16%).
Five-day lansoprazole triple therapy is an effective regimen for H. pylori infection which combines a high cure rate and ulcer healing efficacy with the advantages of excellent patient acceptability and compliance.
There is need for an evidence-based comparison of clinical management strategies to provide the rationale for selection of a particular therapeutic approach to treatment. Ideal dyspepsia treatment should quickly and conveniently alleviate patient symptoms whilst also minimizing the use of healthcare resources.
To examine dyspepsia symptom relief over 16 weeks and compare an omeprazole clinical management strategy with a commonly used combination of antacid-alginate followed by H2-antagonist.
Seven hundred and twenty-five patients participated in this randomized, open, parallel group comparison over 16 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive either an omeprazole treatment strategy (363) consisting of omeprazole 10 mg stepping up to 20 mg and 40 mg as required, or an antacid-alginate/ranitidine treatment strategy (362) consisting of antacid-alginate 10 mL q.d.s. stepping up to ranitidine 150 mg b.d. and 150 mg q.d.s. as required.
A greater proportion of patients receiving the omeprazole clinical management strategy had achieved the stringent health target of complete symptom relief (61 vs. 40%, P < 0.0001) at 16 weeks. Forty-six per cent of omeprazole-treated patients were symptom free after the first 10 mg step compared to only 17% in the antacid-alginate treated group (P = 0.0001). Total relief of heartburn, the most common symptom at entry, was achieved by more patients in the omeprazole treatment group than the antacid-alginate/ranitidine treatment group, 62 vs. 36%, respectively, at 4 weeks, and 81 vs. 60% at 16 weeks (P = 0.0001).
Treatment with the omeprazole clinical management strategy was superior to the antacid-alginate/ranitidine management strategy in providing relief of acid-related dyspepsia symptoms after 16 weeks. In addition, the omeprazole treatment strategy involved fewer GP consultations and thus minimized the use of other healthcare resources.
Although bismuth was both the first drug shown to alter the natural history of peptic ulcer disease and also a constituent of the first very effective eradication regimens, it has been excluded from the newer regimens, despite its safety and low cost, in favour of two antibiotics.
To asses a novel 1-week regimen consisting of bismuth, clarithromycin and a proton pump inhibitor in routine clinical practice.
One hundred and three consecutive patients with peptic ulcer disease and antral biopsies containing Helicobacter pylori were given a 7-day course of treatment with bismuth (tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate chelate) 120 mg q.d.s., clarithromycin 500 mg t.d.s. and lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. Completeness of eradication was assessed by a l3C-urea breath test, in all except three patients, at least 4 months later.
Of the 100 patients who were assessed in this open treatment study 84 (84%; 95% CI: 77-91%) had a negative breath test. Minor side-effects were reported by 14% and more troublesome side-effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hallucinations, nasty taste and body pains) were reported by 10%.
A 1-week course of triple therapy including bismuth, clarithromycin and a proton pump inhibitor is effective in routine clinical practice and is well tolerated.
Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II, CDDP) is a chemotherapeutic agent that induces nephrotoxicity associated with oxidative/nitrosative stress. Sulforaphane (SFN) is an isothiocyanate produced by the enzymatic action of myrosinase on glucorophanin, a glucosinolate contained in cruciferous vegetables. SFN is able to induce cytoprotective enzymes through the transcription factor Nrf2. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether SFN induces a cytoprotective effect on the CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. Preincubation of LLC-PK1 cells with 0.5-5 microM SFN by 24 h was able to prevent, in a concentration-dependent way, CDDP-induced cell death. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 after treatment with SFN. In the in vivo studies, CDDP was given to Wistar rats as a sole i.p. injection at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg. SFN (500 microg/kg i.v.) was given two times (24 h before and 24 after CDDP-injection). Animals were killed three days after CDDP-injection. SFN attenuated CDDP-induced renal dysfunction, structural damage, oxidative/nitrosative stress, glutathione depletion, enhanced urinary hydrogen peroxide excretion and the decrease in antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase). The renoprotective effect of SFN on CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity was associated with the attenuation in oxidative/nitrosative stress and the preservation of antioxidant enzymes.
A case of acute oliguric renal failure following gentamicin and linocomycin therapy is described. Renal biopsy showed an acute interstitial nephritis. This was associated with high serum gentamicin levels and the later development of ototoxicity. Withdrawal of antibiotics and conservative measures was followed by rapid recovery of renal function. Attention is drawn to the association between gentamicin and lincomycin therapy and the development of an acute interstitial nephritis.
Bexarotene has demonstrated chemopreventive and therapeutic efficacy towards mouse lung tumors. Using specimens from our published study that demonstrated the efficacy of bexarotene, we report herein its ability to modulate mRNA expression of genes in both lung and lung tumors. Strain A/J mice were administered vinyl carbamate to induce lung tumors. This was followed by 200 mg/kg body weight of bexarotene administered by oral gavage during Wks 4-25 or 23-25. The mice were sacrificed at Wk 25. The expression of 26 genes was decreased in lung tumors, whereas only two genes, Apolipoprotein D and CYP26b, had their mRNA expression increased by bexarotene. Genes with increased mRNA expression in untreated lung tumors include: epiregulin and kininogen-1 (increased by more than 40-fold) and Caspase-3, Cyclin D1, DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt-3a), E-prostanoid 3 receptor (EP3), c-myc, surfactant protein-C, and survivin (increased by 1.7- to 3.6-fold). Bexarotene decreased the mRNA expression of Caspase-3, Dnmt-3a, EP3, and survivin, as well as the expression of the Cyclin E1, estrogen receptor-alpha, and iNOS genes. Bexarotene had a greater effect in decreasing the expression of Caspase-3, Cyclin E1, Dnmt-3a, EP3, iNOS, and survivin, when administered to mice with established tumors than when administered to mice while tumors were emerging. In summary, bexarotene modulated mRNA expression of genes in mouse lung tumors, being more effective in established tumors than in emerging tumors, suggesting that modulation of expression could be useful as a biomarker for the therapeutic and chemopreventive activity of the drug, especially in established tumors.
In its phase of androgen-independence, prostate carcinoma is characterized by a high proliferation rate and by a strong ability to give rise to metastases. IGF-I has been shown to exert a potent mitogenic action on prostate cancer. We investigated whether IGF-I might also affect the motility of prostate cancer cells and defined the mechanism of action. We found that IGF-I promotes the migratory capacity of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells through the activation of its specific receptor, IGF-IR. This effect was accompanied by a change in cell morphology (as revealed by scanning electron microscopy), and by a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. The treatment of cells with the PI3-K inhibitor, LY294002, counteracted the pro-migratory activity of IGF-I. Experiments were then performed to clarify whether the integrin, alphavbeta3, could be involved in the action of IGF-I. We demonstrated that: a) the IGF-I-induced migration of cells is completely antagonized by an antibody specifically blocking the function of alphavbeta3; b) IGF-I increases alphavbeta3 immunofluorescence at the level of cell membranes, and this effect is counteracted by LY294002; and c) IGF-I increases alphavbeta3 protein levels. Our results demonstrate that IGF-I promotes the motility of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by modulating alphavbeta3 integrin activation/expression; these effects are mediated by the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway. This study: a) supports a crucial role for IGF-I in the progression of the pathology towards the highly metastatic phase; and b) provides an additional rationale basis for the development of therapeutic strategies directed at the IGF-I/IGF-IR system in the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer.
The present study was undertaken to compare efficacy and duration of action of fenoterol and isoetharine in patients who subjectively required urgent therapy. Analysis of the resulting data showed that in this population fenoterol had a longer duration of action and was more effective at the later time periods.
The prognostic significance of supplementing co-enzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)), riboflavin and niacin (CoRN) along with tamoxifen to breast cancer patients was evaluated by measuring the serum cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor. In the present study, 84 breast cancer patients were randomized to receive a daily supplement of CoQ(10) 100 mg, riboflavin 10 mg and niacin 50 mg, one dosage per day along with tamoxifen 10 mg twice a day. Serum cytokine levels were elevated in untreated breast cancer patients (Group II) and significantly reduced after tamoxifen therapy for more than 1 year (Group III). When group III breast cancer patients were supplemented with CoRN for 45 days (Group IV) and 90 days (Group V) along with tamoxifen, a significant reduction in cytokine levels were observed (P < 0.05). Such a decrease in serum cytokine levels after CoRN supplementation in breast cancer patients may suggest good prognosis and efficacy of the treatment, and might even offer protection from metastases and recurrence of cancer.
The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism by which caffeine increases anxiety. Rats were tested in the social interaction test of anxiety after administration of caffeine (20 or 40 mg/kg) alone or in combination with various compounds. In order to investigate the role of adenosine receptors, caffeine was given in combination with 2-chloroadenosine (0.1 and 1 mg/kg). To investigate the role of benzodiazepine receptors, chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (RO 15-1788, 1 and 10 mg/kg) and a triazolobenzodiazepine U-43,465 (32 mg/kg) were used. Finally, an alpha 2-receptor agonist, clonidine (0.1 and 0.025 mg/kg) and a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, DL-propranolol (5 mg/kg), were used to study the role of noradrenergic systems in the effects of caffeine. Caffeine (20 and 40 mg/kg) reduced the time spent in social interaction and this effect was antagonized by chlordiazepoxide, U-43,465 and DL-propranolol, but not by flumazenil, 2-chloroadenosine or clonidine. It was therefore concluded that the anxiogenic effect of caffeine was unlikely to be due to its effects at adenosine or benzodiazepine receptors. It is suggested that the reversal of caffeine's effects by chordiazepoxide may have been "functional," i.e., merely a cancellation of two opposite effects. It is discussed whether the reversal of caffeine's effects by propranolol and U-43,465 are functional, or reflect a noradrenergic site of action.
A 65-year-old patient developed nonpruritic purpuric skin eruptions following 10 days of coumadin treatment. Skin biopsy revealed vasculitis and immunofluorescent studies demonstrated the presence of IgM and C3 deposits in the walls of the affected blood vessels. Rechallenge with coumadin was followed by reappearance of the skin eruptions. Indirect mast cell degranulation test and migration inhibiting factor test were positive in the presence of coumadin. These findings strongly suggest that the skin lesions were induced by an immunologic reaction to warfarin.
There is great potential for host-based gene expression analysis to impact the early diagnosis of infectious diseases. In particular, the influenza pandemic of 2009 highlighted the challenges and limitations of traditional pathogen-based testing for suspected upper respiratory viral infection. We inoculated human volunteers with either influenza A (A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) or A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)), and assayed the peripheral blood transcriptome every 8 hours for 7 days. Of 41 inoculated volunteers, 18 (44%) developed symptomatic infection. Using unbiased sparse latent factor regression analysis, we generated a gene signature (or factor) for symptomatic influenza capable of detecting 94% of infected cases. This gene signature is detectable as early as 29 hours post-exposure and achieves maximal accuracy on average 43 hours (p = 0.003, H1N1) and 38 hours (p-value = 0.005, H3N2) before peak clinical symptoms. In order to test the relevance of these findings in naturally acquired disease, a composite influenza A signature built from these challenge studies was applied to Emergency Department patients where it discriminates between swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 (2009) infected and non-infected individuals with 92% accuracy. The host genomic response to Influenza infection is robust and may provide the means for detection before typical clinical symptoms are apparent.
Diabetes and cancer chemotherapies are often associated with painful neuropathy. The mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain remain poorly understood, and the current therapies have limited efficacy and are associated with dose-limiting side effects. We recently described the pharmacological characterization of cholest-4-en-3-one, oxime (TRO19622), a cholesterol-like compound, that significantly reduced axonal degeneration and accelerated recovery of motor nerve conduction in a model of peripheral neuropathy induced by crushing the sciatic nerve. These results triggered investigation of efficacy in other preclinical models of peripheral neuropathy. Here, we report evidence that daily oral administration of TRO19622, while similarly improving motor nerve conduction impaired in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, also reversed neuropathic pain behavior as early as the first administration. Further exploration of these acute antinociceptive effects demonstrated that TRO19622 was also able to reverse tactile allodynia in vincristine-treated rats, a model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. It is interesting to note that TRO19622 did not have analgesic activity in animal models of pain produced by formalin injection, noxious thermal or mechanical stimulation, or chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, indicating that painful diabetic or chemotherapy-induced neuropathies share a common mechanism that is distinct from acute, inflammationdriven, or lesion-induced neuropathic pain. These results support the potential use of TRO19622 to treat painful diabetic and chemotherapy-induced neuropathies.
