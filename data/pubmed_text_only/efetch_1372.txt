We expanded our genome-wide association study on atrial fibrillation (AF) in Iceland, which previously identified risk variants on 4q25, and tested the most significant associations in samples from Iceland, Norway and the United States. A variant in the ZFHX3 gene on chromosome 16q22, rs7193343-T, associated significantly with AF (odds ratio OR = 1.21, P = 1.4 x 10(-10)). This variant also associated with ischemic stroke (OR = 1.11, P = 0.00054) and cardioembolic stroke (OR = 1.22, P = 0.00021) in a combined analysis of five stroke samples.
This work aimed to assess the cavernous anti-apoptotic role of using chronic low-dose sildenafil/tadalafil with and without testosterone (T) in aged diabetic rats. In all, 140 Sprague-Dawley aged rats were divided into the following groups: controls; induced diabetic rats; diabetic rats that received intramuscular depot T once every 4 weeks; diabetic rats on sildenafil 2 mg kg(-1) orally daily; diabetic rats on T and daily sildenafil; diabetic rats on tadalafil 0.45 mg kg(-1) orally every other day; diabetic rats on every-other-day tadalafil and T; diabetic rats on alternate sildenafil and tadalafil; and diabetic rats on alternate sildenafil, tadalafil and T. After 12 weeks, Bax (apoptotic factor), Bcl(2) (B-cell lymphoma 2; anti-apoptotic factor), cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) were estimated in their cavernous tissues. Compared with the controls, aged diabetic rats showed significant increased cavernous tissue Bax and significant decreased Bcl(2), in which diabetic rats injected with T showed the reverse compared with the diabetic rats. Diabetic rats on sildenafil or tadalafil showed significant increased cavernous Bcl(2) and decreased Bax with upgraded Bcl(2)/Bax ratio that was improved being on T. Diabetic rats on alternate sildenafil/tadalafil with or without T showed further significant increased cavernous tissue Bcl(2) with upgraded Bcl(2)/Bax ratio. It is concluded that frequent low-dose use of sildenafil and/or tadalafil combined with T would be predicted to have a pronounced anti-apoptotic cavernous tissue effect on the cavernous tissues of aged diabetic rats.
Chronic butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) treatment after a single administration of a carcinogen increases lung tumor multiplicity in some inbred strains of mice. We report that BALB/cOla and BALB/cByJ mice given a low dose (10 microg/g of body weight) of 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) develop no lung tumors unless this is followed by chronic BHT exposure. Slightly higher MCA doses (15 and 25 microg/g) induce low lung tumor multiplicities (0.6 and 1.9 tumors/mouse, respectively) that are increased 12-26-fold by chronic BHT administration. This low-dose MCA/BHT model in BALB mice will facilitate the identification of genes regulating susceptibility to lung tumor promotion and pulmonary chemopreventative agents that act at a postinitiation site.
We report a case of severe lithium toxicity precipitated by a thiazide diuretic and compounded by an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. There was severe vasodilatation refractory to noradrenaline.
Addictive drugs hijack mechanisms of learning and memory that normally underlie reinforcement of natural rewards and induce synaptic plasticity of glutamatergic transmission in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a single exposure to cocaine efficiently triggers NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in DA neurons, whereas plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) occurs only after repeated injections. Whether these two forms of plasticity are independent or hierarchically organized remains unknown. We combined ex vivo electrophysiology in acute brain slices with behavioral assays modeling drug relapse in mice and found that the duration of the cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity in the VTA is gated by mGluR1. Overriding mGluR1 in vivo made the potentiation in the VTA persistent. This led to synaptic plasticity in the NAc, which contributes to cocaine-seeking behavior after protracted withdrawal. Impaired mGluR1 function in vulnerable individuals could represent a first step in the recruitment of the neuronal network that underlies drug addiction.
We report on a 32-year-old female patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis for diabetic nephropathy who developed blisters and cutaneous fragility on the dorsa of the hands. Histopathology of an early lesion showed a subepidermal cleft under a regular epidermis with single necrotic keratinocytes and normal dermal structures. In an advanced lesion, a subepidermal bulla and caterpillar bodies were found in the epidermis. Dermal vessel walls were normal and surrounded by a discrete lymphocytic infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence revealed perivascular deposits of C3. Uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin levels of serum, urine and dialysate were repeatedly normal, confirming pseudoporphyria. The patient took furosemide (500 mg daily). Replacement of furosemide by ethacrynic acid led to spontaneous healing of the blisters. The patient was free of further lesions at the 1-year follow-up.
Twenty-seven adult patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma were treated with the M-BACOD regimen during the period 1980-86. Of these, 24 (89%) had advanced Stage III-IV disease by clinical staging and only 3 (11%) had limited disease. CR was achieved in 14 patients (52%), all of whom had advanced disease prior to therapy. The remaining 13 patients (48%) achieved only PR. Of the entire group of 27 patients, 11 (41%) died, 12 (44%) are still in CR, and 4 (15%) have relapsed and are still alive with PR. Of the 14 patients who achieved CR, 1 relapsed, but is currently in PR, showing minimal disease. All of these 14 patients are alive (11 months to 6 years post therapy), and 13 (93%) still remain in CR with a median time of CR of 45 months. Of the 13 patients who only achieved PR, 11 (85%) relapsed and died within a median time of 3.6 months, and 2 patients remain in PR. The above results are similar to those obtained in larger series recorded from other centers. In the light of improved results obtained with new regimens and ABMT, we have now adopted the MACOP-B regimen for treating aggressive lymphoma and have entered an ABMT program for patients with predictable poor prognostic features.
Myocardial taurine level was found to be greater in the rat than in the guinea-pig. Taurine inhibited the development of arrhythmias caused by the i.v. infusion of ouabain in the rat. When ouabain induced arrhythmias, the myocardial taurine level decreased. Both effects were blocked by pretreatment of propranolol. The uptake of taurine into the heart did not necessarily result in the reversal of the PR interval prolonged by ouabain. The protecting effect of taurine against ouabain toxicity was not dependent upon the change in myocardial total ATPase activity.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may induce a variety of acute and chronic renal lesions. Acute interstitial nephritis can follow the use of nearly all NSAIDs, but the number of reported cases is low. Most of these patients are elderly and develop a nephrotic syndrome with acute renal failure while taking NSAID for months. Renal biopsy shows acute tubulo-interstitial lesions with minimal changes in the glomeruli. The renal signs usually improve after discontinuing the drug, with or without steroid therapy, but chronic renal insufficiency or even end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are possible hazards. There is evidence that interstitial nephritis results mainly from a delayed hypersensitivity response to NSAID, and nephrotic syndrome results from changes in glomerular permeability mediated by prostaglandins and other hormones. Nephrotic syndrome without interstitial nephritis may occur, as well as immune-complex glomerulopathy, in a small subset of patients receiving NSAIDs. Patients taking NSAID for months or years may develop papillary necrosis, chronic interstitial nephritis, or even ESRD. Case-control studies suggest that patients at risk are older men who suffer from chronic heart disease and renal hypoperfusion. Impaired medullary circulation and direct toxicity due to a drug metabolite seem to play a critical role in inducing interstitial fibrosis, which can be facilitated by a sustained production of some growth factors and cytokines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Repeated methamphetamine (mAMPH) damages forebrain monoamine terminals and causes degeneration of nonmonoaminergic cell bodies in rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1). These degenerating cortical neurons can be labeled with the fluorochrome dye Fluoro-Jade (FJ) and are found almost exclusively in layers II/III and IV of the vibrissae representation in S1. Within S1, layer IV is organized into discrete, anatomically identifiable units termed barrels, each of which receives information from a single whisker. We previously reported that mAMPH-damaged neurons in S1 were located within the whisker barrels, suggesting that the prolonged mAMPH-induced whisking contributes to S1 neuronal injury. Here, we investigate effects of vibrissae removal on mAMPH-induced damage to S1 neurons. Rats were anesthetized and vibrissae were trimmed from either the left, right, or neither side of the snout. The next day they were given four injections of either saline (1 ml/kg, s.c.) or mAMPH (4 mg/kg, s.c.) at 2-h intervals. Three days later, cortical sections were processed for FJ histochemistry. The hemivibrissotomy produces a hemispheric asymmetry in FJ-positive neurons in barrel cortex, with fewer damaged neurons contralateral than ipsilateral to whisker removal. Taken together with the demonstration that acute injection of this dose of mAMPH induces the immediate early gene zif/268 and Fos protein in barrel cortex, these data suggest that the prolonged behavioral activity involving the vibrissae contributes to the mAMPH-induced damage to S1 neurons. Thus, some of the injurious effects of drugs may depend on afferent activity occurring as a result of the abnormal behaviors evoked by their administration.
Mutation of the obese gene produces obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and compensatory "overexpression" of the defective gene. As insulin activates obese gene expression, it seemed possible that hyperinsulinemia might be responsible for overexpression of the gene. To address this question we rapidly neutralized circulating insulin by injection of an insulin antibody. Unexpectedly, insulin depletion in obese (ob/ob or db/db) mice caused massive adipose RNA degradation confirmed by histological analysis to result from adipocyte cell death by a largely necrotic mechanism. This effect was not observed in lean littermates and was completely corrected by coadministration of insulin. Comparison of multiple tissues demonstrated that the effect was restricted to adipose tissue. Insulin depletion in obese mice by administration of streptozotocin also led to cell death, but this death was less extensive and appeared to be apoptotic in mechanism. Thus insulin may promote the survival side of the physiological balance between adipocyte survival and death.
Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, also called hypersensitivity reaction, is a severe idiosyncratic reaction to drugs, especially to anti-epileptic drugs. Clinical features associate cutaneous eruption, fever, multiple peripheral ganglions, and potentially life-threatening damage of one or more organs. DRESS syndrome is well described in adults treated with aromatic anti-epileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, but also with other drugs. The new anti-epileptic drugs, such as oxcarbazepine also induce various cutaneous eruptions, but with less report of DRESS syndrome. In children, DRESS syndrome is rare and probably underdiagnosed. We report on the case of a 11-year-old girl hospitalised with an acute severe hepatitis revealing an oxcarbazepine-induced DRESS syndrome.
We report three patients in whom neurologic symptoms and cortical laminar necrosis developed after immunosuppressive treatment (cyclosporin A and FK 506) and polychemotherapy (vincristine and methotrexate). Initial neuroradiologic studies showed cortical and white matter involvement. Follow-up studies showed cortical hyper-intense lesions on T1-weighted MR images, consistent with cortical laminar necrosis. The clinical and radiologic data indicate that a transient hypoxic-ischemic process could have been responsible for the encephalic lesions in these three patients.
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a sex and brain region specificity, showing a higher incidence in men than in women, which is caused by cell death of mainly dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalon. Mitochondrial toxins are often used to trigger and mimic neurodegenerative processes. Thus, systemic application of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induces Parkinsonian symptoms, indicating a causative or consequent involvement of mitochondria. Therefore, mitochondria of neural cells may demonstrate a sex and brain region specificity with respect to structural and functional characteristics of these organelles during toxic and degenerative processes. The application of MPTP in vivo and its toxic derivative 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+) ) in vitro represent a well-accepted experimental model of Parkinson's disease. Aside from the known effects of MPP(+) on mitochondria and neural cell survivability and with respect to the supportive role of astrocytes for neuronal function, we aimed to demonstrate the involvement of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV isoform expression in energy and reactive oxygen species production taking part in an impairment of astrocyte survival. MPP(+) caused a specific increase of COX IV-2 transcript and protein levels in male mesencephalic astrocytes, accompanied by decreased ATP and increased reactive oxygen species levels and elevated apoptotic cell death, which were more pronounced in mesencephalic than in cortical astrocytes from male than from female mice. Our data suggest that MPP(+) acts on astrocytes in a sex- and brain region-specific manner involving cytochrome c oxidase isoform expression in an impairment of energy production and elevated oxidative stress levels, which represent hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases.
Digoxin (7.5 micrograms icv) induced 'pop-corn' type of convulsions and 100% mortality. The GABA-ergic agents produced varying degree of protection against digoxin-induced neurotoxicity. Diazepam (4 mg/kg) offered significant protection whereas pentobarbital (5 mg/kg) and baclofen (5 mg/kg) markedly reduced per cent mortality, but ethanol (2 g/kg), progabide (50 mg/kg) and muscimol (0.5 mg/kg) as well as GABA (50 mg/kg) could not offer significant protection in doses used. GABA-ergic agonists; GABA, baclofen, diazepam and pentobarbital when administered along with MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg) a non-competitive NMDA antagonist, a potentiation of anticonvulsant action of MK-801 was observed. MK-801 showed potent anticonvulsant profile in dose range (0.25-1 mg/kg) studied. A synergistic influence of Mg2+ and K+ ions on NMDA receptor antagonism was also observed. A role of GABA-ergic facilitation and NMDA antagonism as a potential anticonvulsant approach in digoxin-induced convulsions in rats has been suggested.
Penicillamine-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and penicillamine-immune complex nephritis are histologically and serologically distinct. One hundred and twenty patients with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine have been analyzed. Eight developed the serologic changes of SLE; in 4, it was necessary to discontinue treatment. In addition, 6 patients developed immune complex nephritis, which necessitated discontinuing treatment. All but 1 have since been managed on triethylene tetramine 2HCl (Trien).
The incidence of proteinuria in D-penicillamine-treated rheumatoid arthritis has been between 10% and 20% in the 1st year of therapy; afterward, few develop proteinuria. Incidence is related to both quantity of penicillamine administered and inherent response variability. About 1/3 of those with proteinuria may proceed to a nephrotic syndrome if therapy is continued. Light microscopy of renal biopsy tissue shows only minimal glomerular changes. Electron microscopy reveals sub-epithelial electron-dense deposits and fusion of epithelial cell processes. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3.
Results of studies have shown that there is an excess risk of venous thromboembolism in users of oral contraceptives containing cyproterone compared with those containing levonorgestrel. We did a case-control study, in which we assessed the risk of idiopathic venous thromboembolism in women taking combined low-dose oestrogen oral contraceptives containing cyproterone (n=24401) or levonorgestrel (n=75000). We compared the 26 women in this population who had idiopathic venous thromboembolism with 144 matched controls. 12 individuals and 30 controls were taking contraceptives that contained cyproterone. Our results suggest that risk of venous thromboembolism is increased four-fold in women taking contraceptives containing cyproterone by comparison with those exposed to levonorgestrel.
Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to enflurane anesthesia are reported. In one patient, enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seizures. Until the cause of the seizures was correctly identified, the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants. Two other patients suffered from partial, complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medication. Epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure-free. Previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG. On the other hand, enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings.
Hepatic fibrosis is a major complication of various chronic liver diseases. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a critical role in the development of liver fibrosis and the axis of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF receptor (PDGFR), a member of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), is closely associated with the activation of HSC. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which also belongs to RTKs, interacts with the PDGF/PDGFR axis, thereby cooperatively promoting hepatic fibrosis. We herein examined the effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which inhibits the activation of several types of RTKs, on the development of rat liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Drinking water with 0.1% EGCG significantly decreased the serum levels of both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase raised by CCl4, thus indicating an improvement of liver injury. In CCl4-injected rats, EGCG markedly attenuated hepatic fibrosis and decreased the amount of hydroxyproline in the experimental liver. The expression of PDGFRbeta and IGF-1R mRNAs in the liver was significantly lowered by the treatment with EGCG. EGCG also decreased the expression of PDGFRbeta and alpha-smooth muscle actin proteins, thus indicating the inhibition of HSC activation. These findings suggest that EGCG can exert, at least in part, an anti-fibrotic effect on the liver by targeting PDGFRbeta and IGF-1R. EGCG might therefore be useful in both the prevention and treatment of hepatic fibrosis.
Based on the encouraging results of the use of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine ([2-CdA], cladribine) in patients with advanced, low-grade lymphomas resistant to conventional therapy and the acceptable toxicity profile encountered, we conducted a phase II trial of 2-CdA in patients with untreated indolent lymphomas. Twenty-eight patients with untreated low-grade lymphomas were given 2-CdA at 0.1 mg/kg/d as a 7-day continuous infusion every 28 to 35 days. A total of 89 courses, median of three courses per patient, of 2-CdA were administered. Seventeen men and 11 women with a median age of 58 years were treated. Fifteen patients had diffuse small lymphocytic (8 with plasmacytoid features), 10 had follicular small cleaved-cell, and there were single patients with monocytoid B-cell, mantle cell and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma histologies. All 28 patients were evaluable for toxicity and 26 were evaluable for response. Nine (35%) patients (4 with diffuse small lymphocytic, 3 with follicular small cleaved-cell, 1 with mantle cell, and 1 with MALT lymphoma) achieved a complete response, and 14 (54%) patients (8 with diffuse small lymphocytic, 5 with follicular small cleaved-cell, and 1 with monocytoid B-cell lymphoma) achieved a partial response, for an overall response rate of 88%. The median response duration was 10 months (range, 3 to 44+). Myelosuppression was the principal toxicity. Actuarial survival at 60 months from initial diagnosis was 60% (95% confidence interval, 35% to 82%) and at 48 months from treatment onset was 62% (95% confidence interval, 39% to 83%). These results establish the major activity of 2-CdA in patients with untreated indolent lymphoma, especially those with the diffuse small lymphocytic subtype.
