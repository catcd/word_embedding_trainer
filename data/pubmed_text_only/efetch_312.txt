A 3-year prospective study of 31,081 admissions to an inner-city, emergency trauma hospital revealed 33 patients less than or equal to 45 years of age who had a total of 35 acute neurovascular events (infarction or hemorrhage) related to cocaine abuse (3% of the total 979 cocaine-related admissions). Fifty-four percent of the events were ischemic, and 46% were hemorrhagic. Six patients died. The majority (63%) of ischemic events were hemispheric and subcortical in distribution. Eleven of 13 angiograms were abnormal (five aneurysms and two arteriovenous malformations were identified). No case of "vasculitis" was seen. Seventy percent of the patients exclusively abused crack cocaine, and 94% of the neurovascular events were related to its use. No first-time cocaine users were identified. During the last year of the study, 29% of the 558 cocaine-related admissions were psychiatric admissions, and most (58%) were for treatment of depressive illness (34 patients were admitted for attempted suicide).
Hypokalaemia was induced by infusing polystyrene sulphonate into the colon of mongrel dogs. Sixty minutes after infusion adrenaline 10 micrograms.kg-1 was injected intravenously, which had no effect on serum creatine kinase activity or myocardial histology in the control dogs. However, in dogs with hypokalaemia creatine kinase activity was increased, and pronounced histological changes were seen 60 min after injection. A clear reciprocal relation was found between serum potassium concentration and creatine kinase activity. Premedication with an alpha 1 blocking agent prevented the changes associated with hypokalaemia. Heart mitochondria were prepared from other dogs with hypokalaemia 5 min after adrenaline injection and their calcium content measured. Heart mitochondrial calcium content was increased in parallel with the decrease in serum potassium concentration. Alpha 1 blockade also prevented the increase in mitochondrial calcium content. These results indicate that the intracellular calcium concentration is considerably increased by alpha 1 receptor stimulus under hypokalaemic conditions and that this increase in calcium concentration plays a crucial role in the genesis of myocardial damage. Since adrenaline increases coronary blood flow small doses of adrenaline in subjects with hypokalaemia may lead to the development of myocardial injury not associated with ischaemia.
Little is known about the contribution of polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) and the folate metabolism pathway in rectal cancer alone. Data were from participants in a case-control study conducted in Northern California and Utah (751 cases and 979 controls). We examined independent associations and interactions of folate, B vitamins, methionine, alcohol, and MTHFR polymorphisms (MTHFR C677T and A1298C) with rectal cancer. Dietary folate intake was associated with a reduction in rectal cancer OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.92 (>475 mcg day compared to < or = 322 mcg) as was a combination of nutrient intakes contributing to higher methyl donor status (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.95). Risk was reduced among women with the 677 TT genotype (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30-0.9), but not men (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.70-1.76) and with the 1298 CC genotype in combined gender analysis (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98). These data are consistent with a protective effect of increasing dietary folate against rectal cancer and suggest a protective role of the MTHFR 677 TT genotype in women and 1298 CC in men and women. Folate intake, low methyl donor status, and MTHFR polymorphisms may play independent roles in the etiology of rectal cancer.
Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression seems safe and effective in liver and kidney transplantation. To assess the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus (TAC)-based immunosuppression after cardiac transplantation as well as the relative impact of tacrolimus on immunosuppression-related side effects such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, we conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of otherwise identical tacrolimus- and cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimens in adult patients undergoing cardiac transplantation.
Eighty-five adult patients (pts) at six United States cardiac transplant centers, undergoing their first cardiac transplant procedure, were prospectively randomized to receive either TAC-based (n = 39) or cyclosporine (CYA)-based (n = 46) immunosuppression. All pts received a triple-drug protocol with 15 pts (18%) receiving peri-operative OKT3 to delay TAC/CYA due to pre-transplant renal dysfunction. Endomyocardial biopsies were performed at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 52. The study duration was 12 months.
Patients were mostly male (87%) Caucasian (90%) with a mean age of 54 years and primary diagnoses of coronary artery disease (55%) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (41%). There were no significant demographic differences between groups. Patient and allograft survival were not different in the two groups. The probability and overall incidence of each grade of rejection, whether treated or not, and the types of treatment required did not differ between the groups. At baseline and through 12 months of follow-up, chemistry and hematology values were similar between the groups except serum cholesterol was higher in the CYA group at 3, 6, and 12 months (239 vs 205 mg/dL, 246 vs 191 mg/dL, 212 vs 186 mg/dL, respectively, p < 0.001). Likewise, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly higher in the CYA group. More CYA patients received therapy for hypercholesterolemia (71% vs 41% at 12 months, p = 0.01). There were no significant differences in renal function, hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, or hyperkalemia during the first 12 months. More CYA patients developed new-onset hypertension requiring pharmacologic treatment (71% vs 48%, p = 0.05). The incidence of infection was the same for the two groups (2.6 episodes/pt/12 month follow-up).
Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression seems effective for rejection prophylaxis during the first year after cardiac transplantation and is associated with less hypertension and hyperlipidemia and no difference in renal function, hyperglycemia or infection incidence when compared to cyclosporine-based immunosuppression.
A case of a dystonic reaction is presented that occurred after the use of prochlorperazine, metoclopramide and ondansetron for the treatment of post-operative nausea and vomiting. The onset of dystonia coincided temporally with the removal of a transdermal scopolamine patch used as adjunctive antiemetic therapy. Withdrawal of concurrently administered anticholinergic medication, after recent use of antiemetic medications with dopamine receptor (D2) inhibition, can unmask a dystonic reaction. This case also suggests that transdermal scopolamine may offer an innovative therapy for the treatment of acute dystonic reactions.
Milk alkali syndrome is a cause of hypercalcaemia, renal failure and alkalosis, and is potentially reversible if detected early and the calcium and alkali source withdrawn. It was originally described in patients ingesting large amounts of calcium containing milk for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. We present a modern day version of the syndrome in three cases which were associated with excessive intake of Rennie, a calcium carbonate containing antacid.
The patient with acute extrapyramidal signs and symptoms presents a significant clinical challenge. We present the case of a young man who developed an acute akathisia and dystonia after inadvertent overdose of olanzapine (Zyprexa) in the setting of a recent discontinuation of fluoxetine. The receptor chemistry and mechanisms pertinent to his presentation are reviewed. An analysis of the literature indicates that a broad incidence range is cited for the extrapyramidal effects of these medications. We suggest a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the undifferentiated patient presenting with extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. The possibility of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome (SS), tricyclic overdose, and cocaine abuse should be considered in a patient with extrapyramidal signs and symptoms, given the potential for complications. An emphasis is placed on the need for carefully verbalized discharge instructions to avoid a potential untoward outcome.
Chinese-herb nephropathy (CHN) is a progressive renal interstitial fibrosis initially reported after concomitant intake of an anorexigen, (dex)fenfluramine, and a Chinese herb ( Aristolochia fangchi) containing nephrotoxic and carcinogenic aristolochic acid (AA). We thus tested the possible enhancing effect of the active enantiomer dexfenfluramine (DXF) on AA nephrotoxicity in a rat model for CHN. Groups of 12 salt-depleted male Wistar rats received daily subcutaneous injections of 7 mg/kg body weight DXF (DXF group), 7 mg/kg body weight AA (AA group), a combination of the same doses of AA and DXF (AA+DXF group), or vehicle (control group) for up to 35 days. Six animals per group were killed on day 10 and the remaining six on day 35. Renal function was evaluated by determining serum creatinine and urinary leucine aminopeptidase activity. Histological evaluation of kidney samples was performed and tubulointerstitial injuries were semiquantified. The DXF group did not differ from controls for any parameter. Similarly elevated serum creatinine levels, decreased leucine aminopeptidase enzymuria, and renal lesions were observed in the AA and the AA+DXF groups after both 10 and 35 days. The formation of specific AA-DNA adducts in liver and renal tissue samples was assessed by the (32)P-postlabelling method. Specific AA-DNA adduct levels were significantly increased in kidney tissues from AA+DXF rats compared with AA rats. These functional and histological data suggest that DXF does not enhance AA nephrotoxicity in a rat model for CHN. Further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanism by which DXF may enhance AA-DNA adduct formation.
Isoprenaline in a single dose induces impairment in perfusion of the subendocardial myocardium of the rat left ventricle. This defect in perfusion persists for up to 150 min and corresponds in distribution to the myocardial necrosis produced by similar doses of isoprenaline. It is mediated by the beta-receptors as it is prevented by beta-blockade with propranolol. It is considered that isoprenaline-induced myocardial necrosis represents myocardial infarction.
To evaluate outcomes 1 year after cessation of treatment for cocaine- and alcohol-dependent individuals.
Randomized controlled trial.
Urban substance abuse treatment center.
Ninety-six of 122 subjects randomized to treatment.
One of five treatments delivered over 12 weeks. Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) plus disulfiram; Twelve-Step facilitation (TSF) plus disulfiram; clinical management (CM) plus disulfiram; CBT without disulfiram; TSF without disulfiram.
Percentage of days of cocaine and alcohol use during follow-up, verified by urine toxicology screens and breathalyzer tests.
First, as a group, participants reported significant decreases in frequency of cocaine, but not alcohol, use after the end of treatment. Secondly, the main effects of disulfiram on cocaine and alcohol use were sustained during follow-up. Finally, initiation of abstinence for even brief periods of time within treatment was associated with significantly better outcome during follow-up.
These findings support the efficacy of disulfiram with this challenging population and suggest that comparatively brief treatments that facilitate the initiation of abstinence may have long-term benefits.
Though the acute complications of lithium toxicity involving the central nervous system have been known for more than 70 years, it is only recently that the longlasting sequelae of lithium intoxication have come to be discussed at length; about fifty-five cases have been reported so far. The acronym SILENT (Syndrome of Irreversible Lithium-Effectuated Neurotoxicity) has been coined recently to denote these sequelae. The present report describes the typical profile of SILENT (persisting cerebellar dysfunction) and suggests measures to decrease the incidence of this potentially serious condition, for which no definitive treatment is available.
Acetaminophen is a dose-dependent toxin. Prognosis in severe acute liver injury is related presumably in part to the dose ingested. We sought to assess the value of acetaminophen dosing information in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) due to acetaminophen toxicity to determine the role of dose as a prognostic indicator.
Prospective data from 113 patients with ALF having single-time-point ingestions of acetaminophen were analyzed. Multivariate and chi tests were used to determine the relationship of dose to clinical outcome. We also used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare prognosis and survival in ALF with acetaminophen dose ingested.
Multivariate and chi analyses failed to show any relationship between acetaminophen dose and spontaneous survival. A separate analysis showed no correlation between acetaminophen dose and clinical prognostic indicators.
Dose of acetaminophen ingested did not seem to play a role in prognosis. The most important prognostic factor was coma grade on admission to study. Acetaminophen dosing information is not always obtainable. When it is, it adds little to the clinical assessment. Severity of encephalopathy is a more reliable indicator of prognosis in these critically ill patients.
Cerebrovascular and cardiac adverse events can be significantly reduced by effective antihypertensive therapy; however, BP control rates remain poor. The objective of this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study was to determine the efficacy and safety of olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine combination therapy in patients with moderate to severe hypertension who had failed to respond to treatment with 8 weeks of open-label amlodipine.
A total of 1017 patients entered the open-label amlodipine monotherapy stage; mean BP at week 0 was 164/102 mmHg. After 8 weeks of amlodipine monotherapy (5 mg/day), non-responding patients (n = 755) were randomized to receive placebo plus amlodipine 5 mg or a combination of olmesartan medoxomil (10-40 mg) with amlodipine 5 mg for 8 weeks. At week 16, patients who had achieved diastolic BP (DBP) <90 mmHg and/or systolic BP (SBP) <140 mmHg continued on randomized treatment for a further 8 weeks. Patients in whom both SBP and DBP were >or=140/90 mmHg at week 16 had their medication uptitrated to olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 20/5 mg, olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 40/5 mg or olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 40/10 mg.
Combination of olmesartan medoxomil (10-40 mg) with amlodipine 5 mg for 8 weeks (double-blind) reduced mean SBP/DBP by up to 16.8 mmHg and 9.6 mmHg, respectively. The additional adjusted mean change in seated DBP (SeDBP) [primary endpoint] with last observation carried forward (LOCF) compared with placebo/amlodipine 5 mg was -2.0 mmHg (p = 0.0207), -3.7 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and -3.8 mmHg (p < 0.0001) for olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 10/5 mg, 20/5 mg and 40/5 mg, respectively. The corresponding additional adjusted mean change in SeSBP compared with placebo/amlodipine 5 mg was -3.5 mmHg (p = 0.0103), -5.8 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and -7.1 mmHg (p < 0.0001) for the olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 10/5 mg, 20/5 mg and 40/5 mg groups, respectively. Uptitration was associated with further mean reductions of up to 12.6 mmHg (SeSBP) and 8.2 mmHg (SeDBP), and allowed additional patients to achieve goal BP. Target BP was defined using both SBP and DBP criteria (patients without diabetes <140/90 mmHg; patients with diabetes <130/80 mmHg). More than 70% of patients on active combination therapy achieved their BP goal by week 24. All combination regimens were well tolerated.
These results suggest that olmesartan medoxomil combined with amlodipine is effective and well tolerated in reducing BP in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.
Forty-one adult males volunteered for a study designed to investigate the thrombogenicity of the Valium® vehicle. Utilizing a standardized protocol, each subject received a sedative dose of Injectable Valium® in the antecubital fossa of one arm and an equivalent volume of vehicle in the contralateral arm. Both were administered with a continuous infusion drip of 5 per cent dextrose in water. Post-operative evaluation extended over 10 weeks and included clinical observation and palpation. Ultrasonic tests for occluded or impaired blood flow were performed with a Doppler Flowmeter.Five subjects (12.2 percent) had venous sequelae with the Valium® and two (4.8 percent) developed sequelae with the vehicle. The incidence of venous sequelae reported in the present study was considerably lower than in previous investigations (66.6 per cent and 37.5 per cent) utilizing the same protocol. The present study indicates that time of continuous infusion appears to contribute to thrombophlebitis subsequent to intravenous injection of Valium®. It also appears that the diazepam vehicle is not the major factor in the occurrence of thrombophlebitis.
Incidence and mechanisms of cimetidine-induced hypotension were investigated during the first intravenous injection of cimetidine (200 mg over three minutes) in 68 consecutive patients in the intensive care unit. Systolic pressure decreased more than 5 mm Hg (average, 14 mm Hg) in 50 patients, exceeding 30 mm Hg in nine (13%), while heart rate and pulmonary artery pressure (seven patients) did not change. Blood pressure decreased significantly more in patients requiring vasoconstrictor drug support. The arterial vasodilator properties of cimetidine were demonstrated in 12 normal volunteers in whom brachial artery cimetidine infusions caused a significant decrease of forearm vascular resistance. This effect was more pronounced when forearm vessels were preconstricted with dopamine hydrochloride (n = 6) or norepinephrine (n = 6), pointing toward an interference of cimetidine with sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. Thus, intravenous injection of cimetidine in critically ill patients, presumably through arterial vasodilatation, is frequently associated with decreases of blood pressure, particularly in patients requiring vasoconstrictor drug support.
The functional role of the human diffuse panbronchiolitis critical region 1 (DPCR1) gene, located in the major histocompatibility complex class I, has not been widely investigated. However, this gene is a well known genetic marker for diffuse panbronchiolitis, a disease affecting human respiratory bronchioles. In this study we explored the association between polymorphisms in DPCR1 and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), an asthma phenotype.
Genotyping of 6 polymorphisms was carried out in a total of 189 Korean asthmatic patients stratified into 93 AERD cases and 96 aspirin tolerant asthma controls. Subjects who exhibited significant decrease of FEV(1) by aspirin provocation were identified as AERD subjects. Logistic and regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between DPCR1 polymorphisms and the risk of AERD as well as FEV(1) decline.
Initial analysis revealed significant association of rs2517449 with AERD, with a P value of .03 via a recessive model; however, the association signal disappeared after multiple testing corrections. In addition, rs2517449 and rs2240804 also showed association signals with decline of FEV(1) after aspirin provocation (P = .007 and .03, respectively, in a recessive model). After testing for multiple comparisons, only the association signal from rs2517449 was retained (P(corr) = .04), while other polymorphisms showed no associations with the risk of AERD and FEV(1) decline.
Our results show that polymorphisms in DPCR1 are not associated with the risk of AERD.
Elderly patients are particularly vulnerable to adverse drug reactions as a result of polypharmacy and metabolic changes associated with aging. We present a case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis induced by olanzapine, a medication commonly used in elderly patients.
An 82-year-old woman was admitted to the extended-care center for short-term rehabilitation after prolonged hospitalization for a pulmonary embolism requiring mechanical ventilation. The pulmonary problem resolved, but her hospitalization and subsequent rehabilitation were complicated by agitated delirium, which was treated with olanzapine and modification of contributory factors. At the time of admission to the rehabilitation facility, the patient had been receiving warfarin for 2 weeks and olanzapine for 6 days. On the eighth day after initiation of olanzapine, erythematous skin lesions developed on dependent areas. The international normalized ratio for warfarin was within the acceptable range; however, because warfarin has been associated with subcutaneous bleeding presenting as petechiae and ecchymosis, subcutaneous enoxaparin was substituted for warfarin. The skin lesions continued to worsen over the next week and developed into palpable lesions. Biopsy of the rash revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In the absence of another cause, olanzapine was discontinued and the rash improved significantly. When the agitation recurred, risperidone was initiated, but the patient experienced dizziness with this agent. Olanzapine was resumed and the skin lesions recurred. Olanzapine was then changed to quetiapine, and the skin lesions improved over the next few weeks.
Olanzapine is commonly used in elderly patients to control behavioral disturbances associated with dementia, delirium, and other psychiatric disorders. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is an infrequently reported adverse drug reaction with olanzapine. Its exact pathogenic mechanism is unknown, but both cell-mediated and humoral immunity appear to play important roles. Because drug-induced vasculitis has an identical clinical presentation and identical serologic/pathologic parameters to idiopathic forms of vasculitis, a high index of suspicion is necessary for its accurate diagnosis.
Because adverse drug reactions are common in elderly patients taking multiple medications, physicians should be vigilant when starting new medications and should attempt to eliminate unnecessary medications. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for leukocytoclastic vasculitis in association with olanzapine.
Mitoxantrone is used for aggressive multiple sclerosis (MS), but concerns about safety, including cardiotoxicity and other laboratory measures, prevail.
To evaluate the incidence and potential predictors of adverse events associated with mitoxantrone at the MS Clinic, University of British Columbia, Canada.
Retrospective review of patients treated with mitoxantrone by standard protocol; maximum cumulative dose = 120 mg/m(2). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured with regular multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scans; blood cell counts and biochemical liver tests were performed before infusions. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine potential predictors of adverse events (graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria, version 4) in patients with normal baseline and > or =1 follow-up MUGA or laboratory assessment.
All 163 patients (58% women) treated with mitoxantrone from 1999 to 2007 were reviewed. Mean baseline age was 41.9 (SD 10.8) years, cumulative dose was 59.7 (SD 26.0) mg/m(2), and median follow-up duration was 14 months (maximum 6.5 years). By study end, 14% developed de novo cardiotoxicity (grade > or =2) as measured by decreased LVEF, 27% neutropenia (grade > or =1), 15% anemia (grade > or =1), and 15% liver toxicity (grade > or =1). Possible predictors of adverse events included sex, age, disease duration, and cumulative dose; only women exposed to a higher cumulative dose were at a greater risk of anemia (adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.48 per 10 mg/m(2)).
Based on cardiac and laboratory assessments, mitoxantrone was reasonably well tolerated. However, cardiotoxicity was evident after doses well below current maximum recommended levels. A dose-response effect was not apparent. Findings emphasize the importance of monitoring; the long-term effects of mitoxantrone in multiple sclerosis require investigation.
To compare the tolerability of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with that of angiotensin II (AII)-receptor blockers and the incidence of cough and angioedema associated with their use through review of published data.
References were identified through a MEDLINE search of articles published between January 1975 and April 1997. Bibliographies of pertinent references were also reviewed.
Results of placebo-controlled and comparative trials of the AII blockers demonstrate that they are at least as effective as ACE inhibitors for hypertension, but exhibit an incidence of cough and absent or rare angioedema like that of placebo.
In the 10 comparative trials described, all reported a lower incidence of cough with AII blockers than with ACE inhibitors. Angioedema was not reported in the comparative trials described.
Dextromethorphan is a commonly used antitussive agent that can be purchased over the counter. It is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 isozyme. Methadone has been found to inhibit CYP2D6, indicating a potential for interaction with dextromethorphan.
An 83-year-old woman was evaluated for delirium, hypersomnia, confusion, lethargy, impaired concentration, and poor food intake. Symptoms resolved soon after discontinuing dextromethorphan.
Vulnerability to delirium was potentially caused by coadministration of methadone, which can inhibit the CYP2D6 isozyme.
Evaluation of delirium should include close investigation of the patient's medications for potential interactions with dextromethorphan.
Fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS) or warfarin (coumadin) embryopathy is a rare condition as a result of fetal exposure to maternal ingestion of warfarin during pregnancy. A male infant, whose mother was treated with the anticoagulant (warfarin) because of a mechanical heart valve replacement after rheumatic heart disease, presented with signs of warfarin embryopathy. The facial dysmorphism included hypoplasia of nasal bridge, laryngomalacia, pectus carinatum, congenital heart defects (atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus), ventriculomegaly, stippled epiphyses, telebrachydactyly, and growth retardation. The pathogenesis and management of FWS are discussed.
Lumbar disc herniation (LDH), degeneration and herniation of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc (IVD) of the lumbar spine, is one of the most common musculoskeletal diseases. Its etiology and pathogenesis, however, remain unclear. Type XI collagen is important for cartilage collagen formation and for organization of the extracellular matrix. We identified an association between one of the type XI collagen genes, COL11A1, and LDH in Japanese populations. COL11A1, which encodes the alpha 1 chain of type XI collagen, was highly expressed in IVD, but its expression was decreased in the IVD of patients with LDH. The expression level was inversely correlated with the severity of disc degeneration. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (c.4603C-->T [rs1676486]) had the most significant association with LDH (P=3.3 x 10(-6)), and the transcript containing the disease-associated allele was decreased because of its decreased stability. These observations indicate that type XI collagen is critical for IVD metabolism and that its decrease is related to LDH.
The significance of O6-methylguanine formation in urinary bladder carcinogenesis was examined using O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) transgenic mice carrying the ada gene. The ada MGMT transgenic mice demonstrated no differences in development of carcinogens-induced urinary bladder carcinomas compared with non-transgenic mice. Furthermore, no variation in p53 mutation frequency was evident between the two groups. The results indicated that other repair systems may have an important role for urinary bladder carcinogenesis. p53 knockout mice showed high sensitivity to urinary bladder carcinogens and increased cell proliferation plays an important role in urinary bladder carcinogenicity of p53 knockout mice. In addition, p53 knockout mice have an organ-specific increased sensitivity to carcinogenicity.
It has been found in a group of 455 gynaecological patients that not all the voluntary muscles of the body respond to suxamethonium in the same way. One group of muscles (e.g. biceps) which is sensitive to suxamethonium, responds by fasciculating in almost every individual. A second, resistant, group of muscles (e.g. pectoralis major) is almost totally unresponsive to suxamethonium. A third muscle group (e.g. triceps) shows fasciculations in about 60% of cases and appears intimately associated with the development of suxamethonium pains, for if fasciculations do occur then suxamethonium pains are likely to ensure, but not necessarily involving all the fasciculating muscles. A theory to account for these different groups has been proposed involving the known variation in distribution of red and white muscle fibres throughout the body.
