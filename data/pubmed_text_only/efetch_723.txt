The present study investigates the effect of the administration of alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (alpha-GPC) on scopolamine-induced amnesia and on brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels and release in rats. The results indicate that alpha-GPC, when administered orally, reverses the amnesia caused by scopolamine in passive avoidance. The peak effect is observed using 600 mg/kg IG, 5 h before training. The effect of the drug is long lasting (up 30 h) in accordance with its pharmacokinetic characteristics. Since, alpha-GPC administered IG is cleaved within the gut mucosal cells to glycerophosphate and free choline, it is tempting to speculate that this drug acts by increasing the ACh precursor pool. This view is supported also by the observation that alpha-GPC partially counteracts the decrease of brain ACh levels elicited by scopolamine administration. The effect is observed in the hippocampus and cortex, but not in the striatum. Moreover, in ex vivo experiments, alpha-GPC is able to increase the amount of ACh released by rat hippocampus slices following potassium stimulation.
A 27-year-old man diagnosed as having dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without myocardial accumulation of 123I-beta-methyl-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid, and he was found to have type I CD36 deficiency. This abnormality of cardiac free fatty acid metabolism was also confirmed by other methods: 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, measurements of myocardial respiratory quotient and cardiac fatty acid uptake. Although the type I CD36 deficiency was reconfirmed after 3 months, the abnormal free fatty acid metabolism improved after carvedilol therapy and was accompanied by improved cardiac function. Apart from a cause-and-effect relationship, carvedilol can improve cardiac function and increase free fatty acid metabolism in patients with both DCM and CD36 deficiency.
Over a 5-year period (1976-1980) 499 patients with non-seminomatous testicular germ cell tumours were included in the Danish Testicular Carcinoma Study (DATECA). The 3-year crude survival for patients in clinical stages I, II and III was 91, 77 and 45 per cent, respectively. In stage I the relapse-free survival for patients given radiation combined with bleomycin and vincristine was significantly higher than that for patients given radiation alone. No difference in the crude survival was observed. For stage II patients maintenance chemotherapy following radiation combined with bleomycin and vincristine did not improve relapse-free or crude survival. The survival of patients with non-seminomatous tumours improved significantly during the 5-year period. This improvement was probably due to the introduction of cis-platinum in the treatment.
Allopurinol, a commonly prescribed medication for gout and hyperuricemia, is a frequent cause of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), which include the drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The adverse events are unpredictable and carry significant morbidity and mortality. To identify genetic markers for allopurinol-SCAR, we carried out a case-control association study. We enrolled 51 patients with allopurinol-SCAR and 228 control individuals (135 allopurinol-tolerant subjects and 93 healthy subjects from the general population), and genotyped for 823 SNPs in genes related to drug metabolism and immune response. The initial screen revealed strong association between allopurinol-SCAR and SNPs in the MHC region, including BAT3 (encoding HLA-B associated transcript 3), MSH5 (mutS homolog 5), and MICB (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B) (P < 10(-7)). We then determined the alleles of HLA loci A, B, C, and DRB1. The HLA-B*5801 allele was present in all (100%) 51 patients with allopurinol-SCAR, but only in 20 (15%) of 135 tolerant patients [odds ratio 580.3 (95% confidence interval, 34.4-9780.9); corrected P value = 4.7 x 10(-24)] and in 19 (20%) of 93 of healthy subjects [393.51 (23.23-6665.26); corrected P value = 8.1 x 10(-18)]. HLA alleles A*3303, Cw*0302, and DRB1*0301 were in linkage disequilibrium and formed an extended haplotype with HLA-B*5801. Our results indicated that allopurinol-SCAR is strongly associated with a genetic predisposition in Han Chinese. In particular, HLA-B*5801 allele is an important genetic risk factor for this life-threatening condition.
Twenty patients, aged 6 months to 20 years, with low-grade astrocytoma (LGA) participated in a chemotherapy trial of vincristine (VCR) and etoposide (VP-16). Fourteen children had recurrent progressive disease at entry on study. Prior treatment consisted of surgical resection alone (6), surgical resection and irradiation (4), surgical resection, irradiation and chemotherapy (2), surgery and chemotherapy (1), and irradiation and chemotherapy (1). Six patients were treated at initial diagnosis of LGA because they were less than 5 years old (5) or for a second primary tumor (1). Four recurrent patients and 3 newly diagnosed patients underwent surgical debulking of their tumors immediately prior to study entry. Tumors were located in the optic nerve/chiasm/hypothalamus (8), brain stem/cerebellum (4), cerebral hemispheres (3), midline structures (3), and spinal cord (2). The treatment plan administered in an out-patient setting consisted of weekly VCR 1.5 mg/m2 for 7 to 8 weeks and VP-16 100 mg/m2 for 5 days repeated every 6 weeks for a total of 18 months of therapy. Responses were evaluated by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Of the 20 patients, 1 exhibited a partial response maintained for 12+ months, 3 exhibited minor responses maintained for a period of 10+ to 35 months, and 11 maintained stable disease for 10 to 42 months. Of the 11 patients with stable disease, 2 were withdrawn early from the study without further therapy. Five of the 20 patients developed progressive disease; for 4 of these 5, this occurred during the first course of therapy. Subsequently, these 5 died due to tumor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The apparent low adverse effect profile of the new drug zafirlukast has made it an attractive choice in the treatment of asthma. We present the first case (to our knowledge) of a potentially serious drug-drug interaction between zafirlukast and theophylline. A 15-year-old white girl with asthma had been taking theophylline (Slo-bid, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals Inc, Collegeville, Pa) (300 mg twice daily), with drug levels of approximately 61 micromol/L (11.0 microg/mL) for several years. Recently, her serum theophylline levels had increased to the toxic range (133.2 micromol/L [24 microg/mL]) shortly after the addition of zafirlukast (Accolate, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Del) to her regimen. Attempts were made to stop and then restart the theophylline therapy at progressively lower doses; however, with each attempt, the patient's reaction to the drug became more toxic, with serum theophylline levels ranging between 99.9 and 149.9 micromol/L (18 and 27 microg/mL). So this potential drug-drug interaction could be investigated, the patient stopped taking both drugs for 1 week. Then, she again started taking theophylline (75 mg twice daily), and over 2 days reached a steady state serum theophylline level of 12.8 to 14.4 micromol/L (2.3-2.6 microg/mL). On the third day, zafirlukast (20 mg twice daily) was reintroduced to the regimen, and the theophylline therapy was continued. By the fifth day, a dramatic 7-fold increase was seen in the serum theophylline level (101.6 micromol/L [18.3 microg/mL]). The areas under the curve for theophylline alone and theophylline with zafirlukast were 29.3 and 197 (mg x h)/L, respectively. One explanation for the noted increase in the theophylline level is that metabolism occurs mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP 1A2), an enzyme that is known to be inhibited with high concentrations of zafirlukast. Although the current metabolism of the 2 drugs in combination is poorly understood, the potential for serious interactions seems to exist in the rapidly growing population of persons with asthma, for whom they may be prescribed. The noted increase in the theophylline level after zafirlukast administration is in contrast to the original reports by the manufacturer. Therefore, we recommend that physicians evaluate serum theophylline levels closely when prescribing the 2 drugs in combination.
To report a case of angioedema likely associated with amlodipine administration in a patient with a right thalamic hemorrhagic stroke.
A 50-year-old female experienced angioedema during hospitalization for a right thalamic hemorrhagic stroke. She had no past history of angioedema and all of her medications were assessed for risk of angioedema. After careful evaluation, case reports linking calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angioedema led to further examination of amlodipine as a cause. Amlodipine therapy had been initiated 24 hours prior to the development of angioedema, which then resolved 72 hours after discontinuation of the drug. In total, the patient experienced oropharyngeal swelling for 10 days.
In determining a cause for the patient's angioedema we eliminated genetic, allergic, physically induced, thyroid autoimmune disease-associated, and medication-induced causes. Three case reports describing 7 patients have linked the CCBs verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine with angioedema. The onset and resolution of symptoms in our patient were very similar to those seen in other case reports. Application of the Naranjo probability scale found a probable link between amlodipine and angioedema.
Although few reports of CCB-induced angioedema exist, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case to suggest a link between angioedema and amlodipine therapy. Clinicians should consider amlodipine as a potential cause of angioedema.
Rates of noradrenaline reuptake and spillover into plasma were examined in conscious rabbits before and during activation of the sympathetic nervous system to determine whether neuronal reuptake varies disproportionately or in parallel with increases in noradrenaline release. The sympathetic nervous system was stimulated by nitroprusside-induced hypotension, 2-deoxyglucose-induced glucopenia or intravenous infusion of isoprenaline before and after administration of desipramine to block neuronal uptake. Spillover of noradrenaline into plasma was estimated from the dilution of intravenously infused 3H-noradrenaline with endogenous plasma noradrenaline. The amount of dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) in plasma that was derived from metabolism of recaptured noradrenaline, together with the desipramine-induced decreases in clearance from plasma of 3H-noradrenaline and appearance in plasma of 3H-DHPG, were used to estimate the rate of neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline. The mean (+/- SEM) resting noradrenaline reuptake rate (n = 28) was 0.62 +/- 0.04 nmol kg-1 min-1, 5-fold greater than the rate of its spillover into plasma (0.12 +/- 0.02 nmol kg-1 min-1). Intravenous infusion of nitroprusside at 3 rates titrated to cause graded increases in heart rate caused 74%, 129% and 240% increases in noradrenaline spillover into plasma and 66%, 104% and 198% increases in noradrenaline reuptake. At 15-30 min after intravenous injection of 2-deoxyglucose (500 mg/kg) there was a 106% increase in noradrenaline spillover and a 93% increase in noradrenaline reuptake. Infusion of isoprenaline (0.25 micrograms kg-1 min-1) caused a 102% increase in noradrenaline spillover and a 130% increase in noradrenaline reuptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The electrophysiologic effects of isoproterenol in patients treated with flecainide for atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia were studied to evaluate the mechanism of tachycardia inducibility after isoproterenol and the value of isoproterenol challenge as a predictor of spontaneous arrhythmia recurrence. Seventeen patients underwent electrophysiologic study before and after oral flecainide administration and after the addition of isoproterenol to flecainide. No patient had inducible sustained supraventricular tachycardia after flecainide alone. Two patients had inducible sustained and six had inducible nonsustained tachycardia after isoproterenol was added to flecainide. The patients were then followed up on the same flecainide dose they received at the time of the electrophysiologic study.
1) Flecainide treatment prolonged HV and VA intervals, and the addition of isoproterenol did not affect these variables. 2) Isoproterenol shortened anterograde and retrograde block cycle length and the refractory period of the accessory pathway and the AV node. It also decreased the tachycardia cycle length, an effect that was due solely to shortening of AV node conduction time. 3) Flecainide treatment prevented tachycardia induction by affecting retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway. Isoproterenol allowed for tachycardia induction and for more sustained episodes of tachycardia by reversing the effect of flecainide on retrograde accessory pathway conduction. 4) Tachycardia recurred during follow-up in all three patients in whom tachycardia of greater than or equal to 10 s duration was induced after isoproterenol but in no patient who had no or shorter episodes of induced tachycardia (and who did not have a change in medical regimen).
1) Isoproterenol reverses flecainide-induced prolongation of block cycle length and refractory periods of the accessory pathway and AV node. 2) Isoproterenol reverses flecainide-induced prevention of tachycardia induction through reversal of the effects of flecainide on the retrograde accessory pathway. 3) The addition of isoproterenol during flecainide restudy is valuable in predicting long-term drug efficacy.
Hypokalemia and lactic acidosis developed following correction of respiratory acidosis in a 5-year-old child who presented with respiratory failure secondary to severe asthma and treated with theophylline, inhaled albuterol, and parenteral methylprednisolone. Calculation of the "anion gap" that provided the clue to presence of lactic acidosis was confirmed by the measurement of serum lactate level.
Although the response of kidneys acutely damaged by ischemia or toxins is dominated by epithelial destruction and regeneration, other studies have begun to define abnormalities in the cell biology of the renal microcirculation, especially with regard to peritubular capillaries. We explored the integrity of peritubular capillaries in relation to expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-alpha proteins, and von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) in mouse folic acid nephropathy, a model in which acute tubular damage is followed by partial regeneration and progression to patchy chronic histological damage. Throughout a period of 14 days, in areas of cortical tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, loss of VEGFR-2 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-expressing peritubular capillaries was preceded by marked decreases in VEGF-A transcript and protein levels. Nephrotoxicity was associated with tissue hypoxia, especially in regenerating tubules, as assessed by an established in situ method. Despite the hypoxia, levels of HIF-1 alpha, a protein known to up-regulate VEGF-A, were reduced. During the course of nephrotoxicity, levels of pVHL, a factor that destabilizes HIF-1 alpha, increased significantly. We speculate that that down-regulation of VEGF-A may be functionally-implicated in the progressive attrition of peritubular capillaries in areas of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis; VEGF-A down-regulation correlates with a loss of HIF-1 alpha expression which itself occurs in the face of increased tissue hypoxia.
The triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the AAAS gene, which encodes the nucleoporin ALADIN. Recently it was shown that ALADIN plays a role in the import of different factors into the nucleus, which prevent the cell from DNA damage and consecutive cell death under oxidative stress. In order to investigate the changes in differential gene expression in ALADIN-deficient or mutated cells under oxidative stress we used fibroblast cell cultures of triple A syndrome patients and compared these to controls. Analysis of 84 genes, which are associated with oxidative stress and antioxidant defense, showed that 7 genes were significantly and differentially regulated, namely BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19kD-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), 24-dehydrocholesterol reduc-tase (DHCR24), dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), nudix-type motif 1 (NUDT1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and scavenger receptor class A, member 3 (SCARA3). Whereas in control cells the expression of DHCR24, FOXM1, NUDT1, and SCARA3 was decreased after paraquat treatment, the expression did not change significantly in patient cells. However, the basal expression of SCARA3 and BNIP3 was significantly higher in patient cells than in controls whereas PTGS2 was less expressed. Furthermore, after paraquat treatment the expression of BNIP3, DUSP1, and PTGS2 was significantly increased in control cells while in patient cells the increase of DUSP1 and PTGS2 expression was significantly reduced. With this work we confirm that cells of triple A patients show an altered induction or downregulation of genes associated with oxidative stress and antioxidant defense.
The restoration of checkpoint mechanisms may provide a rational anticancer approach, but the molecular circuitries of how this can be achieved therapeutically are poorly understood. A pivotal signaling network in colorectal cancer cells involves glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), a multifunctional kinase whose role in tumor cell survival is not defined.
We used molecular, genetic, and pharmacologic antagonists of GSK3beta in p53+/+ or p53-/- colorectal cancer cells. We monitored kinase activity in immunoprecipitation, protein expression by immunoblotting, and cell death by multiparametric flow cytometry. A xenograft colorectal cancer model was used to study antitumor activity in vivo.
Treatment of p53+/+ colorectal cancer cells with pharmacologic inhibitors of GSK3beta resulted in sustained elevation of p53, with up-regulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and loss of survivin levels. Molecular targeting of GSK3beta by overexpression of a GSK3beta dominant-negative mutant, or acute-silencing of GSK3beta by RNA interference, reproduced the induction of transcriptionally active p53 in colorectal cancer cells. This pathway was recapitulated by deregulated Wnt/T-cell factor signaling, with elevation of the tumor suppressor p14ARF, and reduced expression of the p53 antagonist, MDM2. Rather than cell cycle arrest, GSK3beta blockade resulted in p53-dependent apoptosis, which was contributed by acute loss of survivin and inhibition of colorectal cancer growth in mice.
Acute ablation of GSK3beta in colorectal cancer cells activates p53-dependent apoptosis and antagonizes tumor growth. This pathway may be exploited for rational treatment of colorectal cancer patients retaining wild-type p53.
Previous studies by the authors have shown that retinal levels of SERPINA3K, a serine proteinase inhibitor, are decreased in an animal model with diabetic retinopathy (DR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the function of SERPINA3K and its role in DR.
For the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, newborn rats were exposed to 75% O(2) from postnatal day (P) 7 to P12. Cultured retinal cells were treated with CoCl(2) or 2% O(2) to induce hypoxia. CM-H2DCFDA was used to determine the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Inflammatory factors were measured using Western blot analysis or ELISA.
Intravitreal injection of SERPINA3K significantly reduced retinal vascular leakage and leukostasis in the OIR model. SERPINA3K also prevented the hypoxia-induced decrease of occludin, a tight junction protein, in the OIR rat retina and in cultured retinal capillary endothelial cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells. Further, SERPINA3K blocked the overexpression of proinflammatory factors, such as VEGF, TNF-alpha, and ICAM-1, in the retina of the OIR model and in cultured retinal cells exposed to hypoxia. VEGF was downregulated by SERPINA3K at the transcriptional level. Knockdown of SERPINA3K by siRNA resulted in the overexpression of VEGF and TNF-alpha in cultured retinal cells. Moreover, SERPINA3K significantly decreased ROS generation and upregulated the expression and activity of manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels, suggesting antioxidant activity.
SERPINA3K is an endogenous anti-inflammatory factor, and its anti-inflammatory effects may be mediated through antioxidant activity. Decreased retinal levels of SERPINA3K may contribute to retinal inflammation in DR.
Inflammatory pain is linked to reduction in tissue pH. Tissue proton generation is mainly mediated by carbonic anhydrases (CAs). We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of CAs with acetazolamide (ACTZ) increases the tissue pH and reverses inflammation-induced pain. CAs are also present in the central nervous system and control anion concentrations. Furthermore, ACTZ has direct effects on ion channels involved in nociception. In the current study, responses to heat and mechanical stimuli (von Frey filaments) of the paw were assessed before and after carrageenan-induced muscle inflammation and after treatment with ACTZ in rats. ACTZ was administered systemically, locally, or intrathecally 24 h after the induction of inflammation. In separate studies, pH was measured in the inflamed and noninflamed muscles and after administration of ACTZ. Carrageenan injection to the gastrocnemius muscle produced heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia of the paw. Systemic ACTZ reversed the heat hyperalgesia but not mechanical allodynia. Similarly, injections of ACTZ into the inflamed muscle or intrathecally reversed the heat hyperalgesia but not mechanical allodynia. Surprisingly, the pH in the inflamed muscle was not reduced compared with noninflamed muscle. Thus, the current data do not support our hypothesis that ACTZ reduces inflammatory hyperalgesia by raising the reduced pH in muscle. Although the possibility of pH changes and the role of CAs in the microenvironment cannot be ruled out, the mechanism of ACTZ-induced antihyperalgesia is not clear from this study. It is possible that the inhibition of ion channels and/or the inhibition of spinally located CAs contribute to the observed antihyperalgesia.
To detect autoantibodies that could be diagnostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we analyzed serum autoantibodies comprehensively that showed immunoreactivity to proteins in tumor tissue obtained from patients with HCC. Fifteen paired samples of HCC tissue and corresponding nontumorous liver tissue as well as five normal liver tissue samples were used in the study. A combination of proteomics and SEREX (serologic analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries) technique was used. Tissue proteins were separated by 2-DE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and immunoblotted with autologous sera. By comparing each immunoblot pattern, we identified four immunoreactive spots with stronger staining intensity in tumorous tissues than in corresponding nontumorous tissues and in normal liver tissues. Matched proteins on 2-DE gels were identified by LC-MS/MS. These immunoreactive proteins were heat shock 70 kDa protein 1 (HSP70), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, peroxiredoxin, and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). In HCC sera, occurrences of autoantibodies against these proteins were 7/15 (46.7%), 5/15 (33.3%), 5/15 (33.3%), and 6/15 (40.0%), respectively, whereas 2/20 (10.0%), 7/20 (35.0%), 0/20 (0.0%), and 2/20 (10.0%) were in control sera. Immunoblot analysis using commercially available purified proteins was performed to confirm the specificity of autoantibodies. By statistical analysis, autoantibodies against HSP70, peroxiredoxin, and Mn-SOD showed significantly high-frequency immunoreaction in HCC sera. The three antibodies were considered patient-specific antibodies in HCC and may be candidate diagnostic biomarkers for HCC.
A case report is presented in which a patient receiving the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, phenelzine, developed a delayed excitatory reaction following administration of topical cocaine spray during anaesthesia for vocal cord surgery. The pharmacological basis of the drug interaction is discussed.
This study investigated the effects of the intracarotid infusion of etoposide in combination with angiotensin II (AT II)-induced hypertension on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain tissue in rats. Eighty rats were divided into five groups: Group 1, intravenous infusion of AT II to increase arterial blood pressure; Group 2, intracarotid infusion of etoposide at 22.5 mg/m2 for 10 minutes; Group 3, intracarotid infusion of etoposide at 75.0 mg/m2 for 10 minutes; Group 4, intracarotid infusion of etoposide at 75.0 mg/m2 for 20 minutes; Group 5, intracarotid infusion of etoposide at 75.0 mg/m2 for 10 minutes with AT II-induced hypertension. Evans blue staining of the brain was used as a monitor of BBB disruption. Mean arterial blood pressure over the experimental period in Group 1 increased from 86.3 +/- 1.3 mmHg (mean +/- SEM) to 139.0 +/- 2.4 mmHg, and Group 5 from 85.9 +/- 1.8 mmHg to 137.3 +/- 2.4 mmHg. None of the animals in Group 1 and 2 showed any obvious neurological change, while all the animals in Group 3, 4 and 5 exhibited diminished activity as their sole neurological change throughout the course of the experiment. Slight evidence of BBB disruption was seen in only 25% of the animals in Group 1. Significant BBB disruption was found in the animals in Group 2, 3, 4 and 5. No histological change was observed in any animal in Group 1 and 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
A case of acute renal failure requiring dialysis and associated with a characteristic, fulminant clinical course following the intermittent administration of rifampicin is presented. Renal biopsy showed severe tubular injury and a mild interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate. Withdrawal of rifampicin led to a compete resolution of renal injury. We review the literature on the pathogenesis and treatment of this syndrome and we discuss the different substrates for acute renal failure induced by rifampicin.
The liver is a vulnerable target for amphetamine toxicity, but the mechanisms involved in the drug's hepatotoxicity remain poorly understood. The purpose of the current research was to characterize the mode of death elicited by four amphetamines and to evaluate whether their combination triggered similar mechanisms in immortalized human HepG2 cells. The obtained data revealed a time- and temperature-dependent mortality of HepG2 cells exposed to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy; 1.3 mM), methamphetamine (3 mM), 4-methylthioamphetamine (0.5 mM) and D-amphetamine (1.7 mM), alone or combined (1.6 mM mixture). At physiological temperature (37 °C), 24-h exposures caused HepG2 death preferentially by apoptosis, while a rise to 40.5 °C favoured necrosis. ATP levels remained unaltered when the drugs where tested at normothermia, but incubation at 40.5 °C provoked marked ATP depletion for all treatments. Further investigations on the apoptotic mechanisms triggered by the drugs (alone or combined) showed a decline in BCL-2 and BCL- XL mRNA levels, with concurrent upregulation of BAX, BIM, PUMA and BID genes. Elevation of Bax, cleaved Bid, Puma, Bak and Bim protein levels was also seen. To the best of our knowledge, Puma, Bim and Bak have never been linked with the toxicity induced by amphetamines. Time-dependent caspase-3/-7 activation, but not mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψm) disruption, also mediated amphetamine-induced apoptosis. The cell dismantling was confirmed by poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase proteolysis. Overall, for all evaluated parameters, no relevant differences were detected between individual amphetamines and the mixture (all tested at equieffective cytotoxic concentrations), suggesting that the mode of action of the amphetamines in combination does not deviate from the mode of action of the drugs individually, when eliciting HepG2 cell death.
The protective effects of single dose of garlic oil (GO) on acute ethanol-induced fatty liver were investigated. Mice were treated with ethanol (4.8 g/kg bw) to induce acute fatty liver. The liver index, the serum and hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels and the histological changes were examined to evaluate the protective effects. Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were determined for the antioxidant capacity assay. Acute ethanol exposure resulted in the enlargement of the liver index and the increase of the serum and hepatic TG levels (P<0.01), which were dramatically attenuated by GO pretreatment in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01). GO treatment (simultaneously with ethanol exposure) exhibited similar effects to those of pretreatment, while no obviously protective effects were displayed when it was used at 2h after ethanol intake. Histological changes were paralleled to these indices. Beside this, GO dramatically prolonged the drunken time and shortened the waking time, and these effects were superior to those of silymarin and tea polyphenol. In addition, GO dose-dependently suppressed the elevation of MDA levels, restored the GSH levels and enhanced the SOD, GR and GST activities. Compared with the ethanol group, the MDA levels decreased by 14.2% (P<0.05), 29.9% and 32.8% (P<0.01) in GO groups 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. The GST activity increased by 9.97%, 19.94% (P<0.05) and 42.12% (P<0.01) of the ethanol group in GO groups 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively, while the GR activity increased by 28.57% (P<0.05), 37.97% (P<0.01), 50.45% (P<0.01) of the ethanol group in GO groups 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. These data indicated that single dose of GO possessed ability to prevent acute ethanol-induced fatty liver, but may lose its capacity when used after ethanol exposure. The protective effects should be associated with its antioxidative activities.
Three neuroscientists traveled on different occasions from New York to Europe to attend scientific meetings. In an attempt to minimize "jet lag," they all took triazolam, 0.5 mg, during the flight. In addition to the medication, they also consumed ethyl alcohol to a variable degree, none to clinical intoxication. All three experienced an episode of anterograde amnesia that lasted several hours. In two of the individuals, neurologists associated with them did not detect any memory disturbance at the time. These episodes of transient global amnesia were evidently secondary to the triazolam or the combination of triazolam and ethyl alcohol. These episodes suggest caution if using this medication to avoid jet lag, especially if ethyl alcohol will be consumed.
Temporary remission of hypoglycemia was achieved in a dog with an insulinoma by treatment, using streptozotocin. Nephropathy, manifested as a renal tubular defect, and hepatopathy were associated with the administration of streptozotocin.
This is a case report of a 12 year old girl who presented with a rare condition in paediatrics, transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. It is important because it is readily treated by endoscopic means if diagnosed early. Potential aetiologies for this unusual condition are explored.
Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is an additive flame retardant used in the textile industry and in polystyrene foam manufacturing. Because of its lipophilicity and persistency, HBCD accumulates in adipose tissue and thus has the potential of causing metabolic disorders through disruption of lipid and glucose homeostasis. However, the association between HBCD and obesity remains unclear.
We investigated whether exposure to HBCD contributes to initiation and progression of obesity and related metabolic dysfunction in mice fed a normal diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD).
Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a HFD (62.2 kcal% fat) or a ND and treated orally with HBCD (0, 1.75, 35, or 700 μg/kg body weight) weekly from 6 to 20 weeks of age. We examined body weight, liver weight, blood biochemistry, histopathological changes, and gene expression profiles in the liver and adipose tissue.
In HFD-fed mice, body and liver weight were markedly increased in mice treated with the high (700 μg/kg) and medium (35 μg/kg) doses of HBCD compared with vehicle. This effect was more prominent in the high-dose group. These increases were paralleled by increases in random blood glucose and insulin levels and enhancement of microvesicular steatosis and macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue. HBCD-treated HFD-fed mice also had increased mRNA levels of Pparg (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ) in the liver and decreased mRNA levels of Glut4 (glucose transporter 4) in adipose tissue compared with vehicle-treated HFD-fed mice.
Our findings suggest that HBCD may contribute to enhancement of diet-induced body weight gain and metabolic dysfunction through disruption of lipid and glucose homeostasis, resulting in accelerated progression of obesity.

Overdose of tricyclic antidepressants, which inhibit cellular serotonin (5-HT) uptake, sometimes causes acute respiratory syndrome-like symptoms. Their acute and chronic cardiopulmonary actions, which might be implicated, utilising both in vivo and ex vivo animal studies, were investigated in this study. Acute amitriptyline (AMI), iprindole and imipramine caused dose-dependent prolonged rises in pulmonary artery pressure and oedema in anaesthetised cats in vivo. Acute AMI, in isolated ex vivo blood-perfused rat lungs, also caused dose-dependent sustained vasoconstriction, which could be attenuated with either calcium channel inhibition or a nitric oxide donor. It was demonstrated that the pressor effects of AMI were not due to release of histamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, or the activities of cycloxygenase or lipoxygenase. After AMI, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and the pressor actions of 5-HT and noradrenaline were diminished, possibly due to uptake inhibition. Activities of the endothelial-based enzymes, nitric oxide synthase and endothelin-converting enzyme, were undiminished. Large acute doses of AMI caused oedema with rupture of capillaries and alveolar epithelium. Chronic iprindole raised pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricle (RV)/left ventricle (LV) + septal (S) weight. Chronic AMI led to attenuation of the pressor action of 5-HT, especially when associated with chronic hypoxic-induced pulmonary hypertension. RV/LV+S weight increased, attributable to LV decline. The acute and chronic effects observed might have relevance to clinical overdose, while the attenuation of acute effects offers possible therapeutic options.
An epidemiological and entomological survey was conducted in Badohi town of Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh (India) from where an outbreak of kala-azar was reported. Serological and clinical results showed 83 cases who responded to sodium antimony gluconate. Phlebotomus argentipes and P. papatasi could be detected in area of outbreak. An active transmission of kala-azar is strongly indicated.
Itraconazole is a synthetic antifungal agent approved in the USA for the treatment of onychomycosis and serious systemic fungal infections. Animal and clinical pharmacology studies suggest negative inotropic effects with itraconazole. Data from the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System suggest that use of itraconazole is associated with congestive heart failure. We summarise the details of 58 cases suggestive of congestive heart failure in association with the use of itraconazole. Labelling of itraconazole has been changed to alert physicians to this new finding.
