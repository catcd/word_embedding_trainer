Genetic factors appear to be important in the restenotic process after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as in inflammation, a pivotal factor in restenosis. TNFalpha, a key regulator of inflammatory responses, may exert critical influence on the development of restenosis after PCI. The GENetic DEterminants of Restenosis (GENDER) project included 3104 patients who underwent a successful PCI. Systematic genotyping for six polymorphisms in the TNFalpha gene was performed. The role of TNFalpha in restenosis was also assessed in ApoE*3-Leiden mice, TNFalpha knockout mice, and by local delivery of a TNFalpha biosynthesis inhibitor, thalidomide. The -238G-1031T haplotype of the TNFalpha gene increased clinical and angiographic risk of restenosis (P=0.02 and P=0.002, respectively). In a mouse model of reactive stenosis, arterial TNFalpha mRNA was significantly time-dependently up-regulated. Mice lacking TNFalpha or treated locally with thalidomide showed a reduction in reactive stenosis (P=0.01 and P=0.005, respectively). Clinical and preclinical data indicate that TNFalpha plays an important role in restenosis. Therefore, TNFalpha genotype may be used as a risk marker for restenosis and may contribute to individual patient screening prior to PCI in clinical practice. Inhibition of TNFalpha may be an anti-restenotic target strategy.
A woman who was 30 weeks pregnant was given terbutaline sulfate to prevent premature labor contractions. Within several days, she had an acute paraparesis with myalgias and was unable to walk. Full neurologic investigation failed to show any obvious cause. Terbutaline therapy was discontinued, and in 48 hours she became asymptomatic. Terbutaline sulfate (Brethine) is a beta-adrenergic agonist that works on smooth muscle. Various theories about its effect on skeletal muscle have been published. The importance of this case report is to make physicians aware of the rare muscular side effects of terbutaline, and careful observation may obviate extensive and invasive testing.
The ethanolic extract of Amaranthus tricolor L. (ATE) leaves was tested for its efficacy against CCl₄-induced liver toxicity in rats. The hepatoprotective activity of ATE was evaluated via measuring various liver toxicity parameters, the lipid profile, and a histopathological evaluation. A sleeping time determination study and an acute toxicity test were performed in mice. The results clearly showed that oral administration of ATE for three weeks significantly reduced the elevated levels of serum GOT, GPT, GGT, ALP, bilirubin, cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, TG, and MDA induced by CCl₄. Moreover, ATE treatment was also found to significantly increase the activities of NP-SH and TP in liver tissue. These biochemical findings have been supported by the evaluation of the liver histopathology in rats. The prolongation of narcolepsy induced by pentobarbital was shortened significantly by the extract. The acute toxicity test showed that no morbidity or mortality was caused by the extract. The observed hepatoprotective effect appears to be due to the antioxidant properties of A. tricolor, which may pave the way to finding a new drug to be used for fighting liver diseases.
Minor brain injury was inflicted with a small hypodermic needle at four sites from the scalp 7 days before the production of convulsion by i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg lidocaine in mice. The latency to convulsion and survival rate were significantly longer and higher, respectively, in the brain-injured group than in the sham-operated one. Thus, the results suggest that a protective mechanism develops in the injured brain against asphyxia caused by lidocaine convulsion.
The pleiotropic effects of resveratrol include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities, and thus unique possibilities exist to explore mechanistic pathways of chemoprevention. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of microRNA (miRNA) alterations induced by resveratrol in the context of chemopreventive mechanisms against dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis-associated tumorigenesis in the Apc(Min/+) mouse. To that end, Apc(Min/+) mice were exposed to 2% DSS to enhance intestinal inflammation and polyp development. Concurrently, mice received either vehicle or resveratrol treatment via oral gavage for 5 weeks. Interestingly, treatment of DSS-exposed mice with resveratrol resulted in decreased number and size of polyps, fewer histologic signs of cell damage, and decreased proliferating epithelial cells in intestinal mucosa compared with vehicle. Resveratrol treatment dramatically reversed the effects of DSS on the numbers of specific inflammatory CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, B cells, natural killer T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in mesenteric lymph nodes. Resveratrol treatment also decreased interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α protein levels and reduced IL-6 and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression. Microarray analysis revealed 104 miRNAs exhibiting >1.5-fold differences in expression in the intestinal tissue of resveratrol-treated mice. Among them, two miRNAs with anti-inflammatory properties, miRNA-101b and miRNA-455, were validated to be upregulated with resveratrol treatment by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Pathway analysis revealed that numerous differentially regulated miRNAs targeted mRNAs associated with inflammatory processes with known roles in intestinal tumorigenesis. These results suggest that resveratrol mediates anti-inflammatory properties and suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis through miRNA modulation.
Uveal melanoma, the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, is highly resistant to most chemotherapeutic drugs. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is known to inhibit ocular melanoma cell growth. However, the effects of ATO on human uveal melanoma cells are poorly understood. Therefore, this study evaluated the mechanisms of ATO and its inhibiting effects on a human uveal melanoma cell line (SP6.5). An MTT assay indicated that, compared to human fibroblasts, ATO had a stronger inhibiting effect on SP6.5 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The apoptosis ratio in SP6.5 cells, which was indicated by cell DNA fragmentation, was 4.1- to 7.7-fold higher after ATO-treatment. The ATO treatment substantially increased the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9, but not of caspase-8. These findings were consistent with the protein expression observed by Western blots. ATO also significantly enhanced expression of Bax and cytochrome c proteins but suppressed those of Bcl-2. Therefore, ATO-induced apoptosis in uveal melanoma cells occurs mainly through the mitochondrial pathway rather than through the death receptor pathway. This report is the first to evaluate the complete mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway of ATO in uveal melanoma cells. These results can be used to improve the clinical effectiveness of ATO treatment for uveal melanoma.
The differential sensitivity following the administration of delta 9-THC to 3 mouse strains, C57BL/6, DBA/2 and ICR mice, indicated that some of the neurobehavioral changes may be attributable to genetic differences. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which the cannabinoid (CB1) receptor is involved in the observed behavioral changes following delta 9-THC administration. This objective was addressed by experiments using: (1) DNA-PCR and reverse PCR; (2) systemic administration of delta 9-THC, and; (3) intracerebral microinjection of delta 9-THC. The site specificity of action of delta 9-THC in the brain was determined using stereotaxic surgical approaches. The intracerebral microinjection of delta 9-THC into the nucleus accumbens was found to induce catalepsy, while injection of delta 9-THC into the central nucleus of amygdala resulted in the production of an anxiogenic-like response. Although the DNA-PCR data indicated that the CB1 gene appeared to be identical and intronless in all 3 mouse strains, the reverse PCR data showed two additional distinct CB1 mRNAs in the C57BL/6 mouse which also differed in pain sensitivity and rectal temperature changes following the administration of delta 9-THC. It is suggested that the diverse neurobehavioral alterations induced by delta 9-THC may not be mediated solely by the CB1 receptors in the brain and that the CB1 genes may not be uniform in the mouse strains.
Triptans are widely used to treat migraine but have been associated with stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and ischemic heart disease (IHD) in case reports.
To estimate the incidence of stroke, cardiovascular events, and death in a migraine cohort, stratified by triptan prescription, and investigate whether the risk of these events was increased in those treated with triptans.
Migraine patients and matched nonmigraine control subjects were identified from the General Practice Research Database. Computerized records were searched for triptan prescriptions, stroke, TIA, MI, IHD, death, arrhythmia, and confounding variables. Incidence rates were calculated and migraine groups compared with controls using a Cox model, adjusting for confounders.
Of 63,575 migraine patients, 13,664 were prescribed a triptan. There was no association between triptan prescription and stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13; 95% CI 0.78, 1.65), MI (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.60, 1.43), or other outcomes studied. The larger group of migraine patients not prescribed a triptan had an increased risk of stroke (HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.26, 1.82) and IHD (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.18, 1.54) and a decreased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.65, 0.80).
In general practice, triptan treatment in migraine does not increase the risk of stroke, MI, cardiovascular death, IHD, or mortality. Triptans are prescribed to those less at risk of these events.
Previous observations suggest that tubulo-glomerular feedback could be involved in amphotericin B nephrotoxicity. We then investigated the influence of sodium status on the occurrence of renal damage during amphotericin B therapy. A retrospective survey demonstrated that impaired renal function occurred during therapy in 67 per cent of the patients who received amphotericin B alone and in 12 per cent of the patients who received amphotericin B and ticarcillin (parenteral sodium supplement of 100-150 meq per day). Prospective studies were then undertaken both in adults and children. Intravenous sodium supplement was given intravenously as routine prophylaxis with amphotericin B therapy. In all courses amphotericin B was successfully administered without deterioration in renal function. These results support the hypothesis that parenteral sodium supplementation reduces the frequency of developing impaired renal function during amphotericin B therapy.
The hepatocarcinogenicity of 2-methyl-N,N-dimethyl-4-aminoazobenzene, previously shown to be noncarcinogenic in adult rats in the absence of further treatment, was observed by following a 1- to 6-week period of feeding this dye to weanling rats with the dietary administration of 0.05% phenobarbital for up to 70 weeks. Many large hepatocellular carcinomas developed in the phenobarbital-treated animals by 72 weeks, whereas a very small number of tiny neoplastic nodules, including one carcinoma, were seen in the rats not given this drug. This study suggests that the use of promoting agents, following the short-term administration of weak carcinogens for the liver, can be useful in demonstrating the initiating activity of such compounds. This system may be useful in the identification of such agents in the environment.
Bifunctional alkyalating agent, sulfur mustard (SM)-induced cutaneous injury is characterized by inflammation and delayed blistering. Our recent studies demonstrated that 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), a monofunctional analog of SM that can be used in laboratory settings, induces oxidative stress. This could be the major cause of the activation of Akt/MAP kinase and AP1/NF-κB pathways that are linked to the inflammation and microvesication, and histopathological alterations in SKH-1 hairless mouse skin. To further establish a link between CEES-induced DNA damage and signaling pathways and inflammatory responses, skin samples from mice exposed to 2 mg or 4 mg CEES for 9-48 h were subjected to molecular analysis. Our results show a strong CEES-induced phosphorylation of H2A.X and an increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible NOS (iNOS), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels, indicating the involvement of DNA damage and inflammation in CEES-induced skin injury in male and female mice. Since, our recent studies showed reduction in CEES-induced inflammatory responses by glutathione (GSH), we further assessed the role of oxidative stress in CEES-related DNA damage and the induction of inflammatory molecules. Oral GSH (300 mg/kg) administration 1h before CEES exposure attenuated the increase in both CEES-induced H2A.X phosphorylation (59%) as well as expression of COX-2 (68%), iNOS (53%) and MMP-9 (54%). Collectively, our results indicate that CEES-induced skin injury involves DNA damage and an induction of inflammatory mediators, at least in part via oxidative stress. This study could help in identifying countermeasures that alone or in combination, can target the unveiled pathways for reducing skin injury in humans by SM.
Repeated administration of low doses of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAMN) to rats induces a proteinuric renal disease that resembles focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Reactive oxygen molecules may be involved in the progressive course of this nephropathy. Therefore we evaluated whether taurine, an endogenous antioxidant, could limit the extent of renal injury. Sprague-Dawley rats received low-dose injections of PAMN, 2 mg/100 g body wt, over a 12-wk period. Two groups were studied: 1) controls given tap water (n = 23), and 2) an experimental group that drank 1% taurine-supplemented water (n = 22). Taurine-treated nephrotic rats had a reduction in albuminuria, as assessed by the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (26 +/- 4 vs. 44 +/- 4, P less than 0.0001). After 12 wk, creatinine clearance was 0.33 +/- 0.03 (experimental) vs. 0.17 +/- 0.03 ml.min-1.100 g body wt-1 (control) (P less than 0.001), and inulin clearance (n = 6 pairs) was 0.26 +/- 0.04 (experimental) vs. 0.13 +/- 0.02 ml.min-1.100 g body wt-1 (control) (P less than 0.025). Administration of taurine reduced the percentage of segmentally sclerosed glomeruli (9.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 16.2 +/- 1.8%, P less than 0.02) and the tubulointerstitial injury score (1.36 +/- 0.19 vs. 2.61 +/- 0.25, P less than 0.0025) in experimental vs. control rats. Taurine treatment normalized the elevated renal cortical malondialdehyde level in rats with PAMN nephropathy (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Nitric oxide (NO) derived from the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is an important and complex mediator of inflammation in the intestine. Wnt-inducible secreted protein (WISP)-1 (CCN4), a member of the connective tissue growth factor family, is involved in tissue repair. We sought to determine the relationship between iNOS and WISP-1 in colitis. By analyzing human colonic biopsy samples, we showed that the expression of mRNA for both iNOS and WISP-1 was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis samples compared with control tissue. The upregulation of WISP-1 was positively correlated with iNOS expression in two models of colitis, induced by intrarectal trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) or occurring spontaneously in IL-10 deficient mice. Loss of iNOS, studied using iNOS(-/-) mice in both TNBS-induced and IL-10(-/-) colitis models, significantly attenuated the colitis-related WISP-1 increase. In human colonic epithelial cell lines, the NO donor, DETA-NONOate, elevated WISP-1 mRNA and protein expression through a beta-catenin and CREB-dependent, but Wnt-1-independent, pathway. In addition, NO-induced WISP-1 directly induced secretion of soluble collagen in colonic fibroblast cells. NO increases WISP-1 expression both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a new role for iNOS and NO in colitis.
In a 67-year-old man with multiple myocardial infarctions in the past, the use of oral verapamil for control of angina pectoris was followed by the appearance of two previously undiagnosed abnormalities, namely, a dual-pathway AV node conduction pattern, and paroxysms of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia precipitated by premature ventricular beats (PVB). It is probable that the differential effects of verapamil on the fast and slow AV node pathways, and the interplay of PVB with its concealment within the AV node, created the necessary circumstances in the AV node to precipitate the tachycardia. Observed off verapamil over several months, the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm but continued to have numerous premature ventricular beats (PVB's). Nevertheless, neither the clinical electrocardiographic features of dual-pathway AV node conduction nor the AV nodal reentrant tachycardia could be found. The proarrhythmic effect of verapamil and its ability to provoke the very arrhythmia against which it is most effective are of particular interest in view of a similar behavior exhibited by the Class I antiarrhythmic agents.
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is the rate limiting enzyme of heme catabolism whereas indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) catabolizes tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway. We analyzed the expression and biological effects of these enzymes in rat and human breast cancer cell lines. We show that rat (NMU and 13762) but not human cells (MCF-7 and T47D) express HO-1. When overexpressed, we found this enzyme to have anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects by antioxidant mechanisms in these four cell lines. We show that IDO is expressed by rat and human breast cancer cells. IDO inhibition with 1-MT and siRNA leads to diminished proliferation in rat cells. In contrast, HO-1 negative human cell lines increase proliferation upon IDO inhibition. Since we also demonstrate that IDO inhibits the anti-proliferative HO-1, we propose that IDO has opposite effects on proliferation depending on the coexpression or not of HO-1. We also describe that HO-1 inhibits IDO at the post-translational level through heme starvation. In vivo, we show that rat normal breast expresses HO-1 and IDO. In contrast, N-nitrosomethylurea-induced breast adenocarcinomas only express IDO. In conclusion, we show that HO-1/IDO cross-regulation modulates apoptosis and proliferation in rat and human breast cancer cells.
The primary pathway of metabolism of dietary alcohol is via its oxidation in liver by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH). Differences in the ADH enzyme activity or levels of enzyme present could affect the risk for alcoholism. Regulatory variations have been shown to affect the promoter activity and thereby affect the risk for alcoholism. In this study the functional effects of the two SNPs (rs1159918 and rs1229982) in the proximal promoter region of ADH1B that were associated with alcoholism were explored. We examined the effects of five naturally occurring haplotypes on the promoter activity. We observed that a C to A change at rs1229982 increased promoter activity 1.4-fold.
1. The ability of clenbuterol to antagonize the catabolic effect of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone on the skeletal muscles, soleus, gastrocnemius and extensor digitorum longus was studied in mice. 2. Daily injections of 5 mg dexamethasone/kg body weight over 10 days caused a significant (20%) loss of muscle weight and protein content in fast twitch but not in slow twitch muscles. 3. Inclusion of clenbuterol (4 mg/kg) in the diet for the period of dexamethasone treatment partly prevented glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy, and increasing the concentration of clenbuterol to 8 mg/kg diet totally prevented glucocorticoid-induced protein loss in all muscles.
The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between vasodilatation-induced ischemia and poststress glucose uptake. Coronary vasodilators may induce myocardial ischemia due to coronary steal through collateral circulation or transmural blood flow redistribution with diminished subendocardial perfusion. Myocardial ischemia can be demonstrated by increased glucose uptake as previously shown in patients with exercise-induced ischemia.
We studied 11 patients with single-vessel disease and no history of myocardial infarction. Five patients had no collateral circulation, and 6 had angiographic evidence of collateral vessels. We measured myocardial blood flow (MBF) and glucose uptake at baseline and after the administration of dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg) with positron emission tomography, using O-15 water and fluorine 18 deoxyglucose (FDG) as perfusion and glucose tracers. MBF at baseline was 0.82 +/- 0.13 mL/g/min in normal areas and 0.80 +/- 0.15 mL/g/min in areas supplied by stenotic arteries. MBF during dipyridamole was 2.05 +/- 0.66 and 1.19 +/- 0.66 mL/g/min in normal areas and areas with stenotic arteries, respectively (P < or = .001). FDG uptake at baseline was 1.36 +/- 0.55 in normal areas and 1.57 +/- 0.62 in areas supplied by stenotic arteries. FDG uptake after dipyridamole infusion was 1.79 +/- 1.1 and 4.04 +/- 0.84 in normal areas and areas with stenotic arteries, respectively (P < or =.001). MBF and FDG uptake were not different between patients with collateral circulation and those without collateral circulation.
Increased myocardial glucose uptake was consistently observed after dipyridamole administration in those areas with diminished coronary vasodilatory capacity. The similar MBF and FDG findings in patients with and without collateral circulation may indicate that transmural blood flow redistribution appears to be a possible mechanism of dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia.
Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is reported to be an independent risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline. tHcy may potentiate neurotoxic and vasculopathic processes, including amyloid beta protein (Abeta) metabolism, implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.
To examine the relationship of plasma total tHcy levels with clinical, demographic, biochemical, and genetic factors in aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and Parkinson disease (PD).
Plasma tHcy, folate, vitamin B(12), creatinine, and Abeta levels were assessed in individuals evaluated in the Memory, Stroke, and Movement Disorders Units of Massachusetts General Hospital with diagnoses of AD (n = 145), MCI (n = 47), PD (n = 93), CAA (67), hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (hICH) (n = 25), and no dementia (n = 88).
The tHcy levels did not differ across AD, MCI, CAA, hICH, and nondemented control subjects but were increased in the PD group (p < 0.01). The elevated levels within the PD group were due to high tHcy in individuals taking levodopa (p < 0.0001). Increasing tHcy was associated with worse cognition in the PD cases, but not the other diagnostic groups. tHcy levels positively correlated with plasma Abeta levels even after adjustments for age and creatinine (p < 0.0001).
Mean tHcy levels increased with age but did not discriminate diagnostic groups aside from significant elevation in patients with PD taking levodopa. The positive association between tHcy and plasma Abeta levels raises the possibility that these circulating factors could interact to affect AD risk and cognition in PD.
Cholesterol crystal embolism is often an iatrogenic complication in ulcerated atherosclerosis of the aorta.
Two cases of multi-organ embolism of cholesterol crystals were histologically proven in patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparin. Both patients had acute renal failure, hypertension with acute pulmonary edema, skin necrosis and ischemia of the digestive tract. Outcome was favorable after discontinuing anticoagulants, symptomatic treatment, definitive hemodialysis and low-dose corticosteroids.
These two cases are the first reported in the literature of cholesterol crystal embolism occurring during prophylactic treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin. They demonstrate that there is a risk of severe cholesterol embolism in high-risk patients after administration of low-molecular-weight heparin as for non-fractionated heparin, fibrinolytics, arteriography and cardiovascular surgery. Low-molecular-weight heparin thus should not be used in patients with a diagnosis of cholesterol crystal embolism.
Drug-induced liver disease accounts for about 50% of acute or subacute liver failure in the United States. United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) data suggest 8%-20% of liver transplantation in this country per year is for fulminant liver failure due to drugs. Even though the most common medication implicated in acute liver injury is acetaminophen (75%), there are numerous other drugs that are responsible for acute and chronic liver injury. A variety of antifungal medications are known to cause a wide range of liver injury from a mild hepatocellular-cholestatic injury pattern to acute/subacute liver failure. Terbinafine is one of the antifungals that have been associated with such liver injuries. We report a case of terbinafine-induced severe liver failure requiring liver transplantation.
To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of oxcarbazepine as adjunctive therapy in infants and young children (1 month to < 4 years).
Children 1 month to < 4 years of age with inadequately controlled partial seizures taking up to two concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were enrolled in this rater-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. Patients received either high-dose (60 mg/kg/day) or low-dose (10 mg/kg/day) oxcarbazepine as oral suspension. The primary efficacy variable was the absolute change in electrographic partial seizures with a behavioral correlate (type 1 seizure) frequency per 24 hours during the last 72 hours of continuous video-EEG monitoring in the treatment phase compared with baseline seizure frequency.
Of 191 patients screened, 128 were randomized: 64 to both oxcarbazepine dose groups. The median absolute change in type 1 seizure frequency per 24 hours was more effective for the high-dose group (-2.00) compared with the low-dose group (-1.37; p = 0.043). The median percentage reduction in type 1 seizure frequency per 24 hours was also greater in the high-dose group (83.33%) than in the low-dose group (46.18%; p = 0.047). The most frequent adverse events (> or = 10%) were somnolence and pyrexia, and most were mild in severity.
In this study, high-dose oxcarbazepine was significantly more effective than low-dose oxcarbazepine in controlling partial seizures in infants and very young children.
In our previous study, when rasH2 mice and non-transgenic (non-Tg) littermates were injected intraperitoneally with 1,000 mg/kg of urethane once or three times at two-day intervals, the incidence of lung proliferative lesions in rasH2 mice given triple doses of urethane was significantly increased, compared to that in rasH2 mice given a single dose of urethane, and the mutation frequency of the transgene in lung tumors in rasH2 mice given triple doses was lower than that in rasH2 mice given a single dose of urethane. In the present study, differential immunohistochemical expressions of Cyclin D1 and PCNA, that lead to abnormal cell proliferation and tumor development due to uncontrolled G1-S transition in the cell cycle, as well as p53 tumor suppressor gene in pulmonary proliferative lesions obtained from our previous study were investigated. Over-expression of Cyclin D1 in hyperplasias in rasH2 mice given triple doses was significantly increased, compared to that in the single-injection group, but no significant differences in Cyclin D1 between the single and triple injection groups were observed in hyperplasias in non-Tg mice or lung tumors in either rasH2 or non-Tg mice. There were no differences in the PCNA labeling index of hyperplasias in rasH2 or non-Tg mice between the triple-injection and single-injection groups, while the PCNA labeling index tended to be increased in the tumor, compared with that in hyperplasias. There was neither mutation of p53 nor an increase in immunoreactivity of wild type p53 in these proliferative lesions. These results suggest that cyclin D1 over-expression in alveolar/bronchiolar hyperplasias in rasH2 mice in the triple-injection group is not only indicative of a high cell proliferation rate but also of an important role in the process of malignant transformation.
At military training sites, a variety of pollutants such as hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), may contaminate the area originating from used munitions. Studies investigating the mechanism of toxicity of RDX have shown that it affects the central nervous system causing seizures in humans and animals. Environmental pollutants such as RDX have the potential to affect many different species, therefore it is important to establish how phylogenetically distant species may respond to these types of emerging pollutants. In this paper, we have used a transcriptional network approach to compare and contrast the neurotoxic effects of RDX among five phylogenetically disparate species: rat (Sprague-Dawley), Northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), earthworm (Eisenia fetida), and coral (Acropora formosa). Pathway enrichment analysis indicated a conservation of RDX impacts on pathways related to neuronal function in rat, Northern bobwhite quail, fathead minnows and earthworm, but not in coral. As evolutionary distance increased common responses decreased with impacts on energy and metabolism dominating effects in coral. A neurotransmission related transcriptional network based on whole rat brain responses to RDX exposure was used to identify functionally related modules of genes, components of which were conserved across species depending upon evolutionary distance. Overall, the meta-analysis using genomic data of the effects of RDX on several species suggested a common and conserved mode of action of the chemical throughout phylogenetically remote organisms.
