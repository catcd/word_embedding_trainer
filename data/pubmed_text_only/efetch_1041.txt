Haloperidol and clozapine were rapidly withdrawn from a schizophrenic patient on separate occasions several months apart. Mental status changes and fluctuations in involuntary movements were carefully observed under both conditions. Although little change in either mental status or involuntary movements was observed within the 3 weeks following the withdrawal of haloperidol, marked deterioration in mental status and involuntary movements occurred within 1 week of withdrawal of clozapine. Implications of this differential response to withdrawal of antipsychotic medications are discussed.
Thirty four children with tuberculous meningitis were treated with rifampicin (mean, 17 mg/kg/day) and isoniazid (mean, 18 mg/kg/day). Fifteen (44%) showed rise in transaminase GOT and GPT values and four cases (11.7%) developed jaundice, hepatomegaly and low prothrombin levels. Rifampicin was removed in only nine of these 15 cases with signs of liver disfunction, but complete normalization of liver function and disappearance of symptoms occurred in all cases even when the treatment was not interrupted. Children are more sensitive to hepatic injury during rifampicin and isoniazid combination therapy than adults. Our results indicate very good prognosis for this hepatopathy and suggest that rifampicin need not be withdrawn in the benign situations. Removal of the rifampicin treatment may delay recovery of serious cases of tuberculous meningitis.
1. There is some evidence that benzodiazepine may modify the opioid withdrawal syndrome. We have investigated the effect of two different benzodiazepines, diazepam and flunitrazepam, on the morphine withdrawal syndrome experimentally induced in mice. 2. Opiate dependence has been induced by administration of morphine s.c. over a period of five days. Two hours after last morphine administration withdrawal syndrome was induced by s.c. injection of naloxone (5mg/kg). The number of jumps, wet-dog-shakes and paw tremor, and the presence or absence of ptosis, diarrhea, teeth chattering and body tremor were evaluated after naloxone injection. 3. All the signs of morphine withdrawal syndrome was antagonized by flunitrazepam and diazepam, only wet-dog-shake was strongly increased by flunitrazepam.
The effects of follicular phase clomiphene citrate (CC) and two regimens of leuprolide acetate on estrogen-progesterone-induced hyperprolactinemia in nonhuman primates were studied. All groups received estradiol (E2) benzoate (12.5 micrograms intramuscularly on cycle days 2 to 33) and progesterone (P) (silastic implant for cycle days 14 to 33). A gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) (Lupron 0.5 mg daily, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Chicago, IL) was administered from cycle day 2 to 14 in group II and from day 20 of the previous cycle until cycle day 14 in group III. Oral CC was given on cycle days 3 through 7 in group IV. No significant differences of mean E2 and P concentrations were noted between groups. Neither GnRH-a nor CC had an overall effect on E2/P-induced hyperprolactinemia. However, for the 5-day interval at the onset of the P treatment there was a significant increase in prolactin (PRL) secretion for group II (130.4 +/- 30.6) versus group I (53.9 +/- 3.3), group III (64.4 +/- 11.1), and group IV (68.8 +/- 14.3). This suggests that leuprolide may exert a delayed stimulatory effect on PRL secretion, or that complete suppression of the putative paracrine regulation of PRL stimulation may require more than 13 days of GnRH-a administration.
A pattern of perioral dyskinesia was induced in adult male rabbits by concomitant stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors (SKF 38393) and blockade of dopamine D2 receptors (sulpiride). Rabbits treated with sulpiride (6 and 12.5 mg/kg i.v.) then, 90 min thereafter, with SKF 38393 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg i.v.) showed a pattern of perioral dyskinesia characterized by compulsive and repetitive sniffing, licking and vacuous chewing. These effects were completely prevented by the administration of N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA), an A2 > A1 adenosine receptor agonist. The present results confirm that perioral dyskinesia is dependent on the activation of dopamine D1 receptors. They also show that, in order to induce perioral dyskinesia in rabbits, a concomitant blockade of dopamine D2 receptors is required. Finally, the antagonistic effect of NECA on the appearance of perioral movements confirms that adenosine receptors play a key role in the control of dopamine-mediated effects.
We studied the effects of human recombinant interleukin-1 alpha on scopolamine-induced amnesia for a passive avoidance response in the mouse. Post-training intraperitoneal administration of the cytokine (0.25 or 0.50 microgram/mouse) significantly reduced the amnesic effect of scopolamine (1.0 mg/kg i.p.). Our results indicate that peripheral interleukin-1 alpha can influence behavior and suggest the involvement of the cholinergic system in the neuromodulatory actions of this cytokine.
We present a study of the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms and expression of genes encoding the drug-resistance proteins glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in order to gain insights into the pattern of failure evident in mantle cell lymphoma. We note a high preponderance of genetic alterations conferring resistance to standard chemotherapy in this illness. Concurrent with this investigation, we present a series of patients who were provided dose-dense and intense chemotherapy to circumvent these drug-resistance mechanisms. High responses were noted, though durable remissions were few, indicating non-traditional chemotherapy options are important to investigate in this illness.
Progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) are a group of rare, inherited disorders manifesting with action myoclonus, tonic-clonic seizures and ataxia. We sequenced the exomes of 84 unrelated individuals with PME of unknown cause and molecularly solved 26 cases (31%). Remarkably, a recurrent de novo mutation, c.959G>A (p.Arg320His), in KCNC1 was identified as a new major cause for PME. Eleven unrelated exome-sequenced (13%) and two affected individuals in a secondary cohort (7%) had this mutation. KCNC1 encodes KV3.1, a subunit of the KV3 voltage-gated potassium ion channels, which are major determinants of high-frequency neuronal firing. Functional analysis of the Arg320His mutant channel showed a dominant-negative loss-of-function effect. Ten cases had pathogenic mutations in known PME-associated genes (NEU1, NHLRC1, AFG3L2, EPM2A, CLN6 and SERPINI1). Identification of mutations in PRNP, SACS and TBC1D24 expand their phenotypic spectra to PME. These findings provide insights into the molecular genetic basis of PME and show the role of de novo mutations in this disease entity.
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) comprises a group of hereditary connective tissue disorders in which collagen synthesis and fibrogenesis are impaired. Patients with EDS type III have a bleeding tendency manifested by ecchymoses and haematomas. However, thrombotic events are rare in this entity. Herein, we present a 48-year-old Hispanic man with EDS type III who had recurrent cephalic vein thrombophlebitis and thrombosis, and brachial vein thrombosis. Tests for hypercoagulable disorders including antithrombin III activity, protein C activity, protein S activity, anticardiolipin antibodies, homocysteine levels, factor V Leiden mutation and prothrombin gene mutation were negative. The patient required long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. After 3 years follow-up, he did not present further thrombotic events. Clinicians should be aware that patients with EDS might be at risk for hypercoagulable disorders.
Isolated limb infusion (ILI) is a simple yet effective alternative to conventional isolated limb perfusion for the treatment of advanced melanoma of the extremities.
The study group comprised 13 patients with very advanced limb disease who had failed to achieve a satisfactory response to one or more ILIs with melphalan, and in whom amputation was the only other realistic treatment option. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of ILI with fotemustine after systemic chemosensitisation with dacarbazine (DTIC).
Complete remission was achieved in four patients and partial remission in eight patients, with a median response duration of 3 months. Limb salvage was achieved in five of 12 assessable patients (42%). Limb toxicity peaked 9 days after ILI; two patients experienced Wieberdink grade IV (severe) toxicity and four patients had grade V toxicity (requiring early amputation).
ILI with fotemustine after DTIC chemosensitisation can be successful when gross limb disease has not been controlled by one or more ILIs with melphalan. However, it cannot be recommended as a routine method of treatment for advanced melanoma of the extremities because of the high incidence of severe limb toxicity.
Very little information regarding effects on ICP, CPP and the safety of dexmedetomidine in neurosurgical patients has been published. The objective of this study is to gather information on the dosage, sedative effects and adverse effects of dexmedetomidine in neurosurgical patients.
The study design was retrospective and descriptive.
Computerized data were collected from the records of 39 neurosurgical patients in the ICU who received dexmedetomidine between October 2001 and December 2004. MAP, SBP, DBP, HR, ICP and CPP were recorded. The parameter means and standard deviations were obtained and plotted against time.
Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, provides adequate sedation without altering respiratory drive, while facilitating frequent neurological examinations. The FDA approved a dosage range for a loading infusion of 0.1 mcg kg-1 infused over 10 minutes followed by 0.2-0.7 mcg kg-1 h-1 continuous infusion for 24 hours.
A total of 39 patients were enrolled in the study; 26 men and 13 women. The mean age was 34 years. Of the patients enrolled in the study, 15 were successfully extubated with no adverse reactions while maintaining adequate sedation. Agitation was the predominant adverse reaction. Hypotension occurred in 10 patients. The mean CPP increased and the mean ICP decreased. The standard deviation for the means of the ICP and CPP were small and did not fluctuate as widely as the haemodynamic parameters.
Dexmedetomidine can be a safe and effective sedative agent for neurosurgical patients. A loading infusion should be avoided and higher maintenance doses may be required to ensure adequate sedation. Further studies are necessary to establish an optimal dosage regimen.
Aseptic meningitis is a process that is characterised by an inflammatory reaction of the meninges that is not due to any infectious agent. Its aetiology is varied and is most frequently caused by rheumatologic and/or autoimmune processes, chemical or medication-induced meningitis, the most notable drugs involved being antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAI).
We report the case of a 70-year-old male, with no relevant history, who was admitted to hospital five times over a period of 16 months because of acute meningitis with polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, high protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid and normal glucose in cerebrospinal fluid. No evidence of an infectious causation, chemical meningitis, carcinomatosis or autoimmune disease was found and the patient was diagnosed with recurrent aseptic meningitis. It was found that the patient had taken ibuprofen or ketorolac on several occasions, a few hours before the appearance of symptoms. These episodes were quickly resolved after withdrawal of this medication.
A number of NSAI have been reported as inducers of aseptic meningitis, one of the most notable being ibuprofen. We report the case of a patient who, as a consequence of taking ibuprofen and ketorolac, presented episodes of recurrent aseptic meningitis. To our knowledge this side effect of ketorolac has not been reported before. Its clinical features are impossible to differentiate from those of infectious meningitis. Diagnosis is reached by exclusion and a careful pharmacological study, including over-the-counter drugs like some of the NSAI, must be performed in patients with this condition, since it is a problem that can easily be solved by withdrawing the drug that causes it.
Sirolimus has been promoted as an agent to provide immunosuppression for kidney transplant recipients that, in contrast to calcineurin inhibitors, would not be nephrotoxic. However, several reports have observed proteinuria in patients treated with sirolimus, ranging from low grade to nephrotic range. Accordingly, we compared markers of tubular and glomerular damage in an ancillary study of a randomized trial comparing sirolimus and cyclosporine.
Single-center, open-label, randomized, prospective trial.
Patients undergoing cadaveric or living donor kidney transplant at the University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland, between January 2001 and July 2004.
Immunosuppression regimen consisting of cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone versus sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone.
The primary outcome was kidney function, assessed using serum creatinine level. Secondary outcomes included patient and graft survival, number of rejections, and evidence of kidney damage, assessed using glomerular and tubular urine biomarker levels.
Urine and serum were collected at 0, 7, 30, and 90 days. Kidney function was estimated using serum creatinine level. Urinary markers included alpha(1)-microglobulin and retinol-binding protein (tubular), transferrin and albumin (glomerular), and semiquantitative assessment of glucosuria. Protocol kidney biopsies were performed at days 90 and 180.
There were 63 patients randomly assigned to cyclosporine-based regimens, and 64, to sirolimus-based regimens. Kidney function was similar in both groups, whereas levels of markers associated with glomerular damage (albumin, 19.5 vs 8.96 mg/mmol creatinine; P < 0.001; transferrin, 13.1 vs 5.7 mg/mmol creatinine; P < 0.001) and those associated with tubular damage (alpha(1)-microglobulin, 11 vs 7.6 mg/mmol creatinine; P = 0.004; retinol-binding protein, 19.6 vs 9.6 mg/mmol creatinine; P = 0.002) were higher beginning at day 7 in patients randomly assigned to sirolimus therapy, with similar findings through day 90. Glucosuria incidence was higher in patients randomly assigned to sirolimus therapy beginning by day 30 (65% vs 30% on day 30; P = 0.002; 51% vs 22% on day 90; P < 0.001). On histologic examination, the overall severity of tubular lesions was significantly higher in patients randomly assigned to sirolimus therapy.
Small sample size, short-term follow-up likely insufficient to appreciate calcineurin-associated nephropathy.
Compared with a cyclosporine-based immunosuppression regimen, a sirolimus-based regimen is associated with de novo low-grade glomerular proteinuria, increased excretion of markers associated with tubular damage, and evidence of tubular damage on kidney biopsy.
Eighteen neonates born to cocaine-abusing mothers were tested for peripheral and brainstem auditory dysfunction using auditory brainstem responses (ABR). Their data were compared to ABRs from 18 normal neonates. The ABR data were analyzed to determine if ABR parameters were abnormal in neonates born to cocaine-abusing mothers in comparison to normal neonates. ABRs from neonates exposed to maternal cocaine abuse show prolonged interpeak latencies and prolonged absolute latencies. These abnormalities indicate neurologic impairment or dysfunction that warrants further audiologic and neurologic follow-up.
There remain concerns about the safety of once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides (AGs) in the elderly.
To assess the safety of once-daily AGs in elderly patients and evaluate possible risk factors for nephrotoxicity.
Prospective, non-interventional surveillance study.
All patients receiving AGs were monitored over 4 months. Clinicians determined the AG dose for each patient after estimating patient weight and calculating creatinine clearance (CrCl) using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Parallel figures were calculated by the investigators using measured weight. Clinicians obtained an AG trough level 24 h after initiation of treatment, and, if non-toxic, every 5-7 days thereafter. AG toxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of > or =50%.
In the study period, 249 consecutive patients received an AG: 116 (47%) males, mean+/-SD age 75+/-16 years. Forty-two (17%) received amikacin and 207 (83%) gentamicin. An increase of > or =50% in serum creatinine was detected in 31/249 (12.4%); maximal creatinine was < or =177 micromol/l in 16/249 (6.4%), 186-265 micromol/l in nine (3.6%), and >265 micromol/l in six (2.4%). None developed oliguric renal failure. Renal damage correlated with a high AG trough level (>1.1 microg/ml) (p<0.001); haemoglobin level <10 g/dl (p<0.05); hospital admission >7 days prior to AG treatment (p<0.005); and AG treatment > or =11 days (p<0.05). Mean CrCl based on estimated weight was 52+/-18 ml/min; that based on actual weight was 71+/-37 ml/min. Despite this, mean AG dose was 1.3+/-0.6 higher than optimal.
Oliguric and/or lasting renal toxicity is rare in elderly patients receiving once-daily aminoglycosides for <11 days, if regular trough drug levels are monitored.
In two consecutive trials, a total of 395 patients with ovarian cancer were treated with a combination of hexamethylmelamine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapeutic regimens including cisplatin or without this drug. With respect to neurotoxicity, 387 patients were fully eligible. The median follow-up for survival was 45 months. Neurotoxicity in any grade of severity developed in 47% of the patients treated with a cisplatin-containing regimen and in 25% of those treated with the non-cisplatin-containing regimen. The severity of neurotoxicity was much higher, however, in the cisplatin-treated patients. Neurotoxicity-free survival decreased below 50% at cumulative doses of cisplatin between 500 and 600 mg/m2. No additional effect of hexamethylmelamine on the incidence or severity of neurotoxicity could be demonstrated. In patients who survived for more than 5 years, the incidence of cisplatin neuropathy was 61%. Prognostic variables (age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage, performance status, and others) possibly associated with high-risk subgroups could not be identified. The only consistent factor correlated with neurotoxicity was the total dose of cisplatin received.
A patient had suffered twice from an acute urticaria after treatment with two different dental root canal compounds (RCC). Skin prick tests with the single components and formaldehyde 1%aq. were positive to formaldehyde 1%aq., but irritant with formaldehydeRCC. Specific IgE to formaldehyde were positive. Patch tests were positive to formaldehydeRCC only. In the literature 28 patients with immediate symptoms to formaldehyde containing RCC have been described.
Calcium binding proteins are well known to be expressed by different groups of hippocampal interneurons; however, whether voltage-dependent calcium channels (Ca(v)) are also localized in these neurons, changed during and after status epilepticus (SE), and involved in epileptic activity have not been reported. In the present study, we showed the colocalization of three subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca(v)1.2, Ca(v)1.3, or Ca(v)2.1) with different calcium binding proteins such as calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), and parvalbumin (PV). At early stages during and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE), significant changes of expression of Ca(v)1.2, Ca(v)1.3 (L-type), and Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q-type) were found in different groups of hippocampal neurons. Induced expression of Ca(v)1.3 or Ca(v)2.1 in reactive astrocytes was shown at 1 week and 2 months after PISE. At the latter time point, higher percentages of colocalization of PV and Ca(v)1.2, CB, or PV and Ca(v)1.3 or Ca(v)2.1, lower percentages of CR and Ca(v)1.3 or Ca(v)2.1 immunoposivie neurons were observed in gliotic CA1 area. We therefore conclude that voltage-gated calcium channels are expressed by different groups of hippocampal interneurons in the mouse. At acute stages during and after PISE, up- or down-regulation of Ca(v)1.2, Ca(v)1.3, or Ca(v)2.1 in functionally different groups of interneurons in CA1 area may be related to the changes of their plasticity. Up-regulation of Ca(v)1.2, Ca(v)1.3, or Ca(v)2.1 in granule cells may be directly related to the occurrence of SE. The induced expression of Ca(v)1.3 or Ca(v)2.1 in reactive astrocytes at 1 week and 2 months after PISE suggests that Ca(v)1.3 or Ca(v)2.1-related calcium signaling in reactive astrocytes may be involved in initiation, maintenance or spread of seizure activity. In gliotic CA1 area at chronic stage (i.e., 2 months after PISE), the occurrence of higher percentages of colocalization of PV and Ca(v)1.2, CB, or PV and Ca(v)1.3 or Ca(v)2.1, lower percentages of CR and Ca(v)1.3 or Ca(v)2.1 immunopositive neurons may suggest that such colocalizations may be linked to the survival or loss of particular group of hippocampal neurons.
Doxorubicin is a widely used antineoplastic agent that may cause irreversible dilated cardiomyopathy. Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (DIC) can occur several years after exposure and carries a poor prognosis. Although cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a useful intervention in end-stage heart failure unresponsive to optimal medical therapies, its efficacy in DIC remains unknown. Four consecutive patients receiving CRT for DIC were evaluated before and after CRT. CRT resulted in improvements in the mean left ventricular ejection fraction at 1 month from 21+/-4.7% to 34+/-5% (p=0.03) and at 6 months (to 46+/-7.5%, p=0.01). CRT-induced reverse remodeling was observed, with a mean reduction in left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole from 54.75+/-3.7 to 52.5+/-1.9 mm at 1 month (p=0.06) and further to 47+/-2.3 mm at 6 months (p=0.03). All patients experienced reductions in heart failure symptoms and improvements in New York Heart Association functional class (p<0.05). The impact of CRT was sustained over a follow-up of 18.5+/-3.5 months. In conclusion, this study suggests that patients with DIC, refractory to optimal pharmacologic therapy and meeting criteria for resynchronization device implantation, may achieve sustained benefit from CRT.
Mutations in exon 12 of the nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene (NPMc+ (NPM1 COOH terminal mutations)) define a distinct subset of acute myelogenous leukemias (AMLs), in which the NPMc+ protein localizes aberrantly to the leukemic cell cytoplasm. We have found that introduction of the most common NPMc+ variant into K562 and 32D cells sensitizes these cells to apoptosis induced by drugs such as bortezomib and arsenic trioxide (ATO) that induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and that cytotoxicity is prevented in the presence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger. The substitution of tryptophan 288 (W288) by cysteine occurs in the great majority of NPM1c+ mutations. Mutagenesis of cysteine 288 to alanine re-localizes NPMc+ from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus and attenuates the sensitivity of cells expressing this mutation to bortezomib and ATO. Primary AML cells expressing NPMc+ are also significantly more sensitive than other AML cells to apoptosis induced by both drugs at pharmacologically achievable doses. We conclude that the presence of a cysteine moiety at position 288 results in the cytoplasmic localization of NPM1c+ and the increased sensitivity to bortezomib and ATO. These data suggest that bortezomib and ATO may have increased therapeutic efficacy in NPM1c+ leukemias.
Increased dispersion of the QT interval has been observed during pacing or exercise stress testing in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). It has not been established whether this phenomenon is a consequence of ischemia. Therefore, we sought to evaluate whether dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia, as directly detected by echocardiographic monitoring of regional contractile function, would affect QT dispersion. Twenty-four patients with nonsignificant and 34 patients with significant CAD but no previous myocardial infarction underwent dipyridamole stress echocardiography while not taking medications. QT dispersion was measured on a 12-lead electrocardiogram at baseline and at various times after dipyridamole infusion. Dipyridamole infusion did not influence QT dispersion in patients without CAD. QT dispersion was similarly unaffected in patients with CAD in whom dipyridamole did not induce wall motion abnormalities. In contrast, in patients with positive dipyridamole stress test findings, QT dispersion increased from 60 +/- 17 ms at baseline to 94 +/- 25 ms during peak infusion (p <0.0001), with a time course mirroring that of development of contractile abnormalities. QT dispersion returned to 63 +/- 25 ms upon relief of ischemia by administration of aminophylline. The increase in QT dispersion was significantly related to the extent of contractile dysfunction induced by dipyridamole. Although ST-segment depression occurred in only 40% of patients with positive dipyridamole stress test findings, 88% of such patients had an increase in QT dispersion. Analysis of the receiver-operating characteristic curve showed that a QT dispersion increase of > or =20 ms identified positive findings for dipyridamole stress echocardiography with 68% sensitivity and 91% specificity. Thus, QT dispersion is acutely affected by myocardial ischemia induced by the administration of dipyridamole. Measurement of QT dispersion may improve detection of stress-induced ischemia on surface electrocardiograms.
Use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has remained the only regimen potent enough to reduce viral replication in HIV-infected individuals. Its combination with cotrimoxazole has also been recommended in those with CD4% of less than 15%. The use of HAART containing zidovudine (ZDV) in combination with co-trimoxazole carries the risk of anaemia in already anaemic predisposed individuals from HIV infections, opportunistic infections, parasitic infestations, sickle cell anaemia, and malnutrition. The aim of the study is to document the effect of use of combination of HAART containing ZDV with cotrimoxazole in haemoglobin profile of HIV-infected children after one year of its administration at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital (UATH), Gwagwalada. It is also aimed at comparing the result obtained with those on stavudine containing HAART with co-trimoxazole.
A two year prospective study of HIV-infected children on treatment with HAART in combination with co-trimoxazole, and attending the paediatric outpatient special treatment clinic (POSTC) for HIV infected children at the UATH, Gwagwalada from November 2006 to October 2008, was carried out to determine effect of these drug combinations in the haemoglobin profile of infected children. Three monthly PCV level was carried out using haematocrit centrifuge and reader.
A total of 173 patients were started on HAART during the first year recruitment period, 90 (52.0%) were males, while 83 (48.0%) females, giving a male to female ratio of 1.1:1. One hundred and seventeen (67.7%) of patients were on ZDV containing HAART, while 56 (32.3%) were on stavudine containing combination. All patients were started on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis with the exception of 6 (3.5%) patients because of drug reaction. The mean PCV of patients on ZDV containing combination with cotrimoxazole decreased from 30.2 +/- 5.5% to 29.0 +/- 2.3%, with a net decrease of 1.2% after one year treatment, those on stavudine containing combination with co-trimoxazole instead showed an increased from initial PCVof 28.3 +/- 4.2% to 34.2 +/- 3.0% with a net increase of 5.9% after the same duration of treatment, (p > 0.05). While patients on ZDV combination alone without co-trimoxazole prophylaxis had a minimal decrease of 0.9% in their PCV level after one year treatment, those on stavudine combination alone without any prophylaxis instead showed an increase of 6.8% in their PCV after the same duration of treatment.
A combination of HAART containing ZDV plus co-trimoxazole carries risk of anaemia than that of stavudine containing combination with co-trimoxazole. Such combination should therefore not be given to anaemic patients. Regular check in PCV of patients on HAART combination with ZDV and additional cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is required for early detection of significant drop in PCV level.
An on demand intramuscular analgesic system using the Cardiff Palliator was tested. Forty consenting patients were studied after cholecystectomy in a double blind trial using increments of buprenorphine (0.15 mg), meptazinol (50 mg), morphine (5 mg), and pethidine (50 mg). Most patients attained good levels of pain relief (mean analogue pain score 36.5), comparable to intravenous on demand analgesia. There were no technical complications. Significant differences were found between drugs in dizziness (pethidine produced the worst score) but not with other side effects. Buprenorphine produced longer lasting analgesia than meptazinol or pethidine and also gave the lowest pain scores. Patterns of analgesic consumption were the same as with intravenous on demand systems, but larger amounts of drug were generally used. Relative analgesic potencies derived from drug consumption rates were also consistent with those from intravenous on demand studies. An on demand intramuscular analgesic system offers a simple but effective means of relieving severe postoperative pain.
A dominant hypomorphic allele of Tnf, PanR1, was identified in a population of G(1) mice born to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized sires. Macrophages from homozygotes produced no detectable TNF bioactivity, although normal quantities of immunoreactive TNF were secreted. The phenotype was confined to a critical region on mouse chromosome 17, and then ascribed to a C-->A transversion at position 3480 of the Tnf gene, corresponding to the amino acid substitution P138T. As a result of subunit exchange, the protein exerts a dominant-negative effect on normal TNF trimers, interfering with the trimer/receptor interaction. Homozygotes are highly susceptible to infection by Listeria monocytogenes, confirming the essential role of TNF in innate immune defense. However, PanR1 mutant mice show normal architecture of the spleen and Peyer's patches, suggesting that TNF is not essential for the formation of these lymphoid structures.
Maternal cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); however, the mechanism underlying this association is currently unknown. Prenatal nicotine exposure is accompanied by a decrease in the magnitude of hypoxic ventilatory depression, the component of hypoxic ventilatory response that activates the PDGF-beta receptor (PDGFR) and its downstream anti-apoptotic cascade in the caudal brainstem (CB) of developing rats. In this study, we evaluated the effect of prenatal nicotine exposure on PDGFR activation and the subsequent activation of downstream anti-apoptotic processes through the Akt/BAD pathway. The 5-day timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats underwent surgical implantation of an osmotic pump containing either normal saline (control) or a solution of nicotine tartrate. The CB was harvested from 5-day-old rat pups (n=8-10 for each time point) in each group after exposure to normoxia or hypoxic challenges with 10% O(2) for 5, 15, 30, 60 or 120 min. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblots of CB lysates revealed phosphorylation of PDGFR, Akt and BAD-136 during hypoxia in control pups. Prenatal nicotine exposure was associated with attenuation of these responses at all time points. Analysis of an early apoptotic marker in the CB revealed that activation of cleaved caspase-3 occurred only at 120 min of hypoxic exposure in the control. Prenatal nicotine exposure accelerated this response, causing early activation at 30 and 60 min. We conclude that prenatal nicotine exposure attenuates the phosphorylation of PDGFR, Akt and Bad-136 during hypoxia in the CB of developing rats. This modulation of anti-apoptotic cascades accelerates activation of the early apoptotic marker. We speculate that prenatal nicotine exposure affects apoptosis in the CB of developing animals and may increase the vulnerability of neural cells in the respiratory control area, a process that may underlie the association between maternal smoking and SIDS.
To investigate anti-arthritic activity of luteolin (Lut) in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA)-induced arthritis (AA) in rats. AA was induced by injecting with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). Male rats were randomly divided into five groups with 10 mice in each group: (1) control group (saline), (2) AA group, (3) AA+Diclofenac Sodium (AA+DS, 5 mg/kg), (4) AA+Lut (20 mg/kg), (5) AA+Lut (40 mg/kg). Male SD rats were subjected to treatment with Lut at 10 and 20 mg/kg from days 18 to 24 after immunization. Arthritic scores, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-17 (IL-17), paw histopathology and the proteins of P2X4 pathway were assessed at the end of the experiment. Lut reduced the severity of arthritic scores during the experimental period as compared with positive control (RA). Lut significantly suppressed TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-17 as compared with RA group. Histopathological examination indicated that Lut alleviated infiltration of inflammatory cells and synovial hyperplasia as well as protected joint destruction. Lut significantly suppressed P2X4, NLRP1, ASC, and Caspase-1p10. Lut may be a potential preventive or therapeutic candidate for the treatment of inflammation and arthritis.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is implicated in the pathophysiology of various cardiovascular diseases, but the role of ER stress in cardiac rupture and/or remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) is still unclear. Here we investigated whether ER stress plays a major role for these processes in mice. We ligated the left coronary artery (LCA) without reperfusion in mice and administered either NaCl or 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA, 20 mg/kg/d) intraperitoneally for 4 weeks. Cardiac rupture rates during the first week of MI were 37.5% and 18.2% in the control and 4-PBA groups, respectively. The extent of ventricular aneurysm and fibrosis was less, and the cardiac function better, in the 4-PBA group compared with the control group. The protein levels of ER stress markers in the heart tissues of the control group remained elevated during the entire 4-week period after MI, while pro-apoptotic proteins mainly increased in the early phase, and the pro-fibrotic proteins markedly increased in the late phase post MI; 4-PBA decreased all of these protein levels. In the primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or fibroblasts, hypoxia (3% O2) increased the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes and promoted the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts, all of which were attenuated by 4-PBA (0.5 mM). These findings indicate that MI induces ER stress and provokes cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis, culminating in cardiac rupture and remodeling, and that the attenuation of ER stress could be an effective therapeutic target to prevent post-MI complications.
