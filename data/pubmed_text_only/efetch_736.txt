Community chemoprophylaxis with a regimen of sequential minocycline/rifampin (adults) or rifampin alone (children [less than 12 years of age]) was undertaken in a remote Arctic community one year after an outbreak of meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. Nasopharyngeal carriage rates of N. meningitidis before prophylaxis were 32.4% in Inuit (Eskimos) and 6% in Caucasians, with maximal carriage (44.8%) in adolescents. Serogroup B accounted for 63.9% of all isolates before prophylaxis. One week after prophylaxis, the nasopharyngeal carriage rates were 0.8% in Inuit who had received prophylaxis and 33.3% in those who had not received prophylaxis (P less than 0.005). This reduction persisted at nine weeks after prophylaxis, when carriage rates were 1.2% in those who had received prophylaxis and 22.6% in individuals who had not received prophylaxis. Of the strains obtained before prophylaxis, 7.8% were sulfadiazine-resistant, whereas 35% of all isolates obtained from prophylaxis were sulfadiazine-resistant. Rifampin- or minocycline-resistant strains were not identified either before or after prophylaxis.
Despite the availability of prostaglandin E1 for more than 7 years as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in patients with erectile dysfunction, the problem of penile discomfort after prostaglandin E1 application has remained unsolved. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study we investigated the effect of 2 different prostaglandin E1-procaine concentrations on 24 patients suffering from pain following intracorporeal injection of prostaglandin E1 alone. Intracavernous injection of 20 micrograms. prostaglandin E1 with 10 mg. procaine (study 1) failed to improve local painful sensations. The combination of 20 micrograms. prostaglandin E1 with 20 mg. procaine (study 2) decreased the incidence of local pain significantly (p < 0.01). These preliminary results show that the combination of prostaglandin E1 plus procaine represents a beneficial alternative in patients with penile pain due to the single substance.
Metoclopramide is a dopamine-receptor antagonist which stimulates the upper gastrointestinal tract motility. It is often used in the management of some forms of nausea and vomiting. Hypertensive crisis which occurred in a 76-year-old man who had received metoclopramide 30 mg daily is reported.
MASA syndrome is a recessive X-linked disorder characterized by mental retardation, adducted thumbs, shuffling gait, aphasia and, in some cases, hydrocephalus. Since it has been shown that X-linked hydrocephalus can be caused by mutations in L1CAM, a neuronal cell adhesion molecule, we performed an L1CAM mutation analysis in eight unrelated patients with MASA syndrome. Three different L1CAM mutations were identified: a deletion removing part of the open reading frame and two point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions. L1CAM, therefore, harbours mutations leading to either MASA syndrome or HSAS, and might be frequently implicated in X-linked mental retardation with or without hydrocephalus.
Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is a valuable noninvasive method for quantifying autonomic cardiac control in humans and has been utilized during dipyridamole echocardiographic test to differentiate positive from negative test results.
We aimed to evaluate, by means of HRV analysis, the influence of the angiographic severity of coronary artery disease on cardiac autonomic control during dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia.
We analyzed RR interval variability changes during dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia in 31 selected patients (mean age 54 +/- 9 years) with available coronary angiography and positive dipyridamole echocardiographic test. Spectral components of HRV were assessed by means of wavelet transform analysis for the last 5 min before the beginning of the test (baseline) and for 5 min after the onset of ischemia-related events (peak dipyridamole effect).
Patients were divided into three groups according to the number of coronary diseased vessels (Group A, single-vessel disease; Group B, double-vessel disease; Group C, triple-vessel disease). No difference was detectable at baseline among the three groups. After dipyridamole, low-frequency power, a measure of sympathetic modulation of heart rate, increased and echocardiographic wall motion score index worsened in all groups (p < 0.001). The increase in low-frequency power was more evident in Group C patients than in the other two groups (p < 0.005). Furthermore, after dipyridamole, a direct correlation was found between low-frequency power and wall motion score index (r = 0.59; p < 0.001).
These data suggest that HRV analysis performed during dipyridamole echocardiographic test provides useful information to assess the severity of coronary artery disease.
Urinary MHPG (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol) amounts increased threefold during a toxic delirious state in a 57-year-old bipolar patient 3 days after phenelzine treatment was stopped. This norepinephrine metabolite was not expected to rise as monoamine oxidase (MAO) was completely blocked. In addition, the delirious state appeared as a rebound phenomenon and not an acute toxic state during drug administration. It seems that phenelzine acts more through catecholamine release phenomenon than by inhibition of MAO.
A patient developed asterixis 13 weeks after starting a therapy with carbamazepine. Serum concentration of carbamazepine was within the therapeutic levels. Further factors which might have provoked asterixis were an impairment of pulmonary function and the combination with a neuroleptic and lithium. Since the latter risk factors had already been present for a long time, it may be assumed that the addition of carbamazepine triggered the development of asterixis.
Selective inhibitors of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) have considerable potential as treatments for type 2 diabetes. Presented herein are the syntheses, structure-activity relationships, and efficacy evaluation of 4-(phenylsulfonamidomethyl)benzamides as 11beta-HSD1 inhibitors. Through modification of our initial lead 5, we have identified potent and selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibitors, such as 11n, which demonstrated improved glycemic control, decreased serum lipids, and enhanced insulin sensitivity when dosed ip in diabetic ob/ob mice.
Desipramine was given to 34 outpatients aged 20 to 51 years who had primary major depressive disorder but who were otherwise in good health. Daily dosage at bedtime was constant for the final 3 weeks of the 5-week study (mean, [SD] 169.1 [46.1] mg). Electrocardiograms done predrug and after 5 weeks were read by a cardiologist blind to the order in which they were performed. Plasma samples drawn 14 hours after the final study dose were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography; mean (SD) levels were 140.2 (140.0) ng/ml for desipramine and 56.5 (29.4) ng/ml for 2-hydroxydesipramine (2-OH-DMI). Heart rate and PR, QRS and QTc intervals were significantly greater at the end of the study than at baseline, while QT intervals were significantly less. Changes in heart rate and PR, QT and QTc intervals were significantly negatively correlated with the value of the respective cardiac parameters at baseline. Changes in PR interval were significantly positively correlated with log desipramine, log 2-OH-DMI and log (desipramine + 2-OH-DMI). Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that, for PR interval, each of the three plasma level variables showed a significant ability to improve R2 over that obtained from baseline PR alone. These findings suggest that both 2-OH-DMI and desipramine plasma levels predict a prolongation of intracardiac conduction in younger adults and that monitoring both levels may be useful in the clinical management of certain younger adult patients.
The effects of diphenhydramine, domperidone, ondansetron, and diphenidol on motion- and apomorphine-induced pica (i.e., kaolin ingestion) in rats as the measure analogous to emesis in other species were examined. Diphenhydramine (10 and 20 mg/kg) and diphenidol (30 mg/kg) inhibited kaolin intake induced by 60-min double rotation, while domperidone and ondansetron did not. Kaolin intake induced by apomorphine (10 mg/kg) was inhibited by domperidone (2 mg/kg) and diphenidol (30 mg/kg), but not by diphenhydramine or ondansetron. These findings suggest that the emetic pathways through the inner ear (double rotation) and the chemoreceptor trigger zone (apomorphine) are pharmacologically independent and are mediated by histamine H1 receptors and dopamine D2 receptors, respectively. Diphenidol may inhibit a common locus of emesis.
Butterbur extracts (Petasites hybridus) are recommended for the prevention of migraine, but pharmacovigilance reports may be suggestive of rare hepatobiliary toxicity. To evaluate its hepatotoxic potential, a series of in vivo and in vitro studies were carried out. Essentially, there were no signs of hepatocellular toxicity at estimated therapeutic C(max) levels of 60 ng/ml. Nonetheless, in a 28-day toxicity study at approximately 200-fold of therapeutic doses, induced liver transaminases and bilirubin elevations were observed. In a subsequent 6-month chronic toxicity study, the initial hepatobiliary effects were reproduced, but at the end of the study, liver function recovered and returned to normal as evidenced by clinical chemistry measurements. To identify possible mechanisms of hepatotoxicity, we investigated liver function in vitro at > 170-fold of therapeutic C(max) levels, including cytotoxicity (lactate dehydrogenase, MTT, and ATP), transaminase activities (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), albumin synthesis, urea and testosterone metabolism to assay for cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity. Only with extracts rich in petasin (37% petasin) and at high and well above therapeutic doses, liver toxicity was observed. A toxicogenomic approach applied to hepatocyte cultures enabled hypothesis generation and was highly suggestive for extracts high in petasin content to impair bile acid transport and lipid and protein metabolism. Importantly, neither chronic rat in vivo nor rat in vitro studies predicted reliably hepatotoxicity, therefore reemphasizing the utility of human-based in vitro investigations for the development of safe medicinal products. Finally, toxicogenomics enabled the characterization of a novel butterbur extract with no signals for hepatotoxicity.
This study assessed the risk of thrombo embolic events and bleeding complications among atrial fibrillation patients.
A cohort of patients with chronic non-valvular atrial fibrillation were identified from medical claims (diagnosis codes 427.31 and 427.32). Subjects were identified from 1 January 1998-31 December 2000 and were continuously enrolled for 6 months prior to the first occurring atrial fibrillation medical claim. Cox proportional hazards analysis with time varying covariates was used for the event analysis.
Of 6764 subjects retained for analysis, 3541 (52.4%) were exposed to warfarin. Adjusting for baseline characteristics, warfarin exposure was associated with lower likelihood of an arterial thromboembolic event compared to no exposure (HR: 0.710, CI: 0.540-0.934). No benefit was found in the use of warfarin in the prevention of intracranial events (HR: 1.119, CI: 0.929-1.349). Use of warfarin increased the risk of minor bleeding events (HR: 3.600, CI: 2.537-5.109), and all bleeding events (HR: 1.502, CI: 1.289-1.749).
The risk of arterial thromboembolic events was associated with warfarin exposure as expected. An increase in the risk of minor and total bleeding events among patients treated with warfarin was observed. The results of this study suggest that there may be a gap between the clinical trial and coagulation clinic performance of warfarin in reducing the risk of thromboembolic events versus what is achievable in general practice.
This experiment was designed to evaluate the reflexive heart rate (HR) response to acute blood loss during sodium nitroprusside (SNP), prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and trimethaphan (TM) induced-hypotension in isoflurane anesthetized dogs. Reflexive increase in HR to acute blood loss was significantly greater during PGE1 induced-hypotension than during that with SNP. TM inhibited the reflexive HR response to acute blood loss. These results suggest that PGE1 induced-hypotension provides a safer margin than that with SNP and TM when rapid bleeding occurs during anesthesia and surgery.
Mutations in the gene encoding granulin (HUGO gene symbol GRN, also referred to as progranulin, PGRN), located at chromosome 17q21, were recently linked to tau-negative ubiquitin-positive frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLDU). Since then, 63 heterozygous mutations were identified in 163 families worldwide, all leading to loss of functional GRN, implicating a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Together, these mutations explained 5 to 10% of FTLD. The high mutation frequency, however, might still be an underestimation because not all patient samples were examined for all types of loss-of-function mutations and because several variants, including missense mutations, have a yet uncertain pathogenic significance. Although the complete phenotypic spectrum associated with GRN mutations is not yet fully characterized, it was shown that it is highly heterogeneous, suggesting the influence of modifying factors. A role of GRN in neuronal survival was suggested but the exact mechanism by which neurodegeneration and deposition of pathologic brain inclusions occur still has to be clarified.
S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is a risk factor for many diseases, including tumor progression and neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that SAH may indirectly enhance the invasion of C6 glioma cells by induction of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) secreted from the murine microglia BV2 cells. We obtained conditioned medium (CM) by incubating BV2 cells with SAH (1-50nM) for 24 h. We found that the SAH-containing CM (SAH-BV2-CM) strongly enhanced the invasiveness of C6 glioma cells and that this effect increased with increasing concentrations of SAH in the SAH-BV2-CM. The effect of CM could be attributed to its MMP-2 activity, as a result of increased protein and messenger RNA expression of MMP-2 in BV2 cells induced by SAH. In BV2 cells treated with SAH, the binding abilities of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and stimulatory protein-1 (Sp1) to the MMP-2 promoter were increased, whereas the level of NF-kappaB inhibitor was decreased. In addition, SAH significantly increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/serine/threonine protein kinase (or protein kinase B) (PI3K/Akt) proteins but did not affect that of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase or p38. Pretreatment of BV2 cells with an inhibitor specific for ERK (U0126) markedly abated the expression of ERK and MMP-2. Furthermore, SAH significantly and dose dependently decreased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) in BV2 cells. Thus, SAH may induce the invasiveness of C6 glioma cells by decreased TIMP-2 expression and increased MMP-2 expression in BV2 cells. The latter effect is likely mediated through the ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways, with increased binding activities of NF-kappaB and Sp1 to the MMP-2 gene promoter.
The autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR) is a multifunctional protein involved in cellular adhesion, proliferation, motility and apoptosis. Our study showed that increased AMFR protein expression in the hippocampus of KM mice correlated with enhanced capacity for learning and memory following the shuttle-box test and was significantly elevated in the highest score group. Also, AMF and AMFR mRNA expression positively correlates with the mRNA expression of the synapse marker synaptophysin (Syp). Aging studies in the senescence-accelerated mouse strain (SAM) prone/8 (SAMP8), an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealed significantly decreased mRNA and protein expression of AMF and AMFR in the hippocampus. This is especially true for AMFR and AMF protein expression compared with age-matched SAM resistant/1 (SAMR1) mouse strain as the control. Additionally, the low mRNA expression of AMFR could be up-regulated by the four nootropic traditional Chinese medicinal prescriptions (TCMPs): Ba-Wei-Di-Huang decoction (BW), Huang-Lian-Jie-Du decoction (HL), Dang-Gui-Shao-Yao-San (DSS) and Tiao-Xin-Fang decoction (TXF). AMFR protein expression could be up-regulated by two TCMPs, Liu-Wei-Di-Huang decoction (LW) and BW. This indicated that AMFR is involved in the process of learning and memory in the central nervous system. These results may provide useful clues for understanding the etiology of AD.
In order to study whether a theophylline-related seizure is caused by a decrease in serum vitamin B6, serum pyridoxal (PAL) levels were measured in children with bronchial asthma treated with theophylline. The serum PAL levels of asthmatic children (n = 31) treated with theophylline were significantly lower than those of control subjects (n = 21). Moreover, we evaluated PAL levels in four subjects within twenty-four hours after a seizure with or without fever. The level was low in three of the four. These results suggest that the decrease in PAL levels caused by theophylline may lower the seizure threshold.
Meningiomas are the most common primary nervous system tumor. The tumor suppressor NF2 is disrupted in approximately half of all meningiomas, but the complete spectrum of genetic changes remains undefined. We performed whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing on 17 meningiomas and focused sequencing on an additional 48 tumors to identify and validate somatic genetic alterations. Most meningiomas had simple genomes, with fewer mutations, rearrangements and copy-number alterations than reported in other tumors in adults. However, several meningiomas harbored more complex patterns of copy-number changes and rearrangements, including one tumor with chromothripsis. We confirmed focal NF2 inactivation in 43% of tumors and found alterations in epigenetic modifiers in an additional 8% of tumors. A subset of meningiomas lacking NF2 alterations harbored recurrent oncogenic mutations in AKT1 (p.Glu17Lys) and SMO (p.Trp535Leu) and exhibited immunohistochemical evidence of activation of these pathways. These mutations were present in therapeutically challenging tumors of the skull base and higher grade. These results begin to define the spectrum of genetic alterations in meningiomas and identify potential therapeutic targets.
The genetic basis of hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a subtype of ALL characterized by aneuploidy and poor outcome, is unknown. Genomic profiling of 124 hypodiploid ALL cases, including whole-genome and exome sequencing of 40 cases, identified two subtypes that differ in the severity of aneuploidy, transcriptional profiles and submicroscopic genetic alterations. Near-haploid ALL with 24-31 chromosomes harbor alterations targeting receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and Ras signaling (71%) and the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF3 (encoding AIOLOS; 13%). In contrast, low-hypodiploid ALL with 32-39 chromosomes are characterized by alterations in TP53 (91.2%) that are commonly present in nontumor cells, IKZF2 (encoding HELIOS; 53%) and RB1 (41%). Both near-haploid and low-hypodiploid leukemic cells show activation of Ras-signaling and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-signaling pathways and are sensitive to PI3K inhibitors, indicating that these drugs should be explored as a new therapeutic strategy for this aggressive form of leukemia.
Hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by impaired intestinal folate absorption and impaired folate transport into the central nervous system. Recent studies in 1 family revealed that the molecular basis for this disorder is a loss-of-function mutation in the PCFT gene encoding a proton-coupled folate transporter. The current study broadens the understanding of the spectrum of alterations in the PCFT gene associated with HFM in 5 additional patients. There was no racial, ethnic, or sex pattern. A total of 4 different homozygous mutations were detected in 4 patients; 2 heterozygous mutations were identified in the fifth patient. Mutations involved 4 of the 5 exons, all at highly conserved amino acid residues. A total of 4 of the mutated transporters resulted in a complete loss of transport function, primarily due to decreased protein stability and/or defects in membrane trafficking, while 2 of the mutated carriers manifested residual function. Folate transport at low pH was markedly impaired in transformed lymphocytes from 2 patients. These findings further substantiate the role that mutations in PCFT play in the pathogenesis of HFM and will make possible rapid diagnosis and treatment of this disorder in infants, and prenatal diagnosis in families that carry a mutated gene.
Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) belongs to a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases. As a consequence of its ability to cleave structural extracellular matrix molecules, mammalian MMP-9 is associated with vital inflammatory processes such as leucocyte migration and tissue remodelling and regeneration. Interestingly, MMP-9 genes have been identified in fish, but functional data are still limited and focus on the involvement of MMP-9 in embryonic development, reproduction and post-mortem tenderization. Here, we describe the involvement of MMP-9 in the innate immunity of carp. In carp, MMP-9 was most notably expressed in classical fish immune organs and in peritoneal and peripheral blood leucocytes, indicating a role of MMP-9 in immune responses. In our well-characterized zymosan-induced peritonitis model for carp, we analysed expression of the MMP-9 gene and the gelatinolytic levels of both pro- and activated forms of MMP-9. The biphasic profile of MMP-9 mRNA expression indicated involvement during the initial phase of inflammation and during the later phase of tissue remodelling. Also, in vitro stimulation of carp phagocytes with lipopolysaccharide or concanavalin A increased MMP-9 gene expression, with a peak at 24 hr. The increase of MMP-9 mRNA correlated with the peak of MMP-9 gelatinolytic level in culture supernatants. These results provide evidence for an evolutionarily conserved and relevant role of MMP-9 in the innate immune response.
Neuroblastoma is a malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system that often presents with widespread metastatic disease, resulting in survival rates of less than 50%. To determine the spectrum of somatic mutation in high-risk neuroblastoma, we studied 240 affected individuals (cases) using a combination of whole-exome, genome and transcriptome sequencing as part of the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiative. Here we report a low median exonic mutation frequency of 0.60 per Mb (0.48 nonsilent) and notably few recurrently mutated genes in these tumors. Genes with significant somatic mutation frequencies included ALK (9.2% of cases), PTPN11 (2.9%), ATRX (2.5%, and an additional 7.1% had focal deletions), MYCN (1.7%, causing a recurrent p.Pro44Leu alteration) and NRAS (0.83%). Rare, potentially pathogenic germline variants were significantly enriched in ALK, CHEK2, PINK1 and BARD1. The relative paucity of recurrent somatic mutations in neuroblastoma challenges current therapeutic strategies that rely on frequently altered oncogenic drivers.
Although CB(1) receptor activation evokes neuroprotection in response to cannabinoids, some cannabinoids have been reported to be peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) ligands, offering an alternative protective mechanism. We have, therefore, investigated the ability of a range of cannabinoids to activate PPAR alpha and for N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA), an endogenous cannabinoid-like compound (ECL), to evoke neuroprotection.
Assays of PPAR alpha occupancy and gene transactivation potential were conducted in cell-free and transfected HeLa cell preparations, respectively. In vivo estimates of PPAR alpha activation through fat mobilization and gene transcription were conducted in mice. Neuroprotection in vivo was investigated in wild-type and PPAR alpha gene-disrupted mice.
The ECLs OEA, anandamide, noladin ether and virodhamine were found to bind to the purified PPAR alpha ligand binding domain and to increase PPAR alpha-driven transcriptional activity. The high affinity synthetic CB(1/2) cannabinoid agonist WIN 55212-2 bound to PPAR alpha equipotently with the PPARalpha agonist fenofibrate, and stimulated PPARalpha-mediated gene transcription. The phytocannabinoid delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol was without effect. OEA and WIN 55212-2 induced lipolysis in vivo, while OEA pre-treatment reduced infarct volume from middle cerebral artery occlusion in wild-type, but not in PPAR alpha-null mice. OEA treatment also led to increased expression of the NFkappa B-inhibitory protein, Ikappa B, in mouse cerebral cortex, while expression of the NFkappa B-regulated protein COX-2 was inhibited.
These data demonstrate the potential for a range of cannabinoid compounds, of diverse structures, to activate PPAR alpha and suggest that at least some of the neuroprotective properties of these agents could be mediated by nuclear receptor activation.
To compare side effects after intravenous administration of dantrolene sodium in subjects susceptible to and those nonsusceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MHS and MHN, respectively).
We studied two groups, six patients thought to be MHS and six assumed MHN subjects, and analyzed their responses to intravenously administered dantrolene.
Dantrolene (3 mg/kg) was administered slowly into an antecubital vein, and blood samples were withdrawn from the other arm at 5 and 25 minutes after infusion. Shortly thereafter, all subjects underwent a clinical neurologic assessment, and side effects were graded subjectively by the study participants.
Side effects occurred in all subjects. Visual symptoms occurred more commonly in MHN than in MHS subjects. Subjective muscle weakness of the extremities, dizziness, and fatigue occurred more commonly and were more severe in MHS patients than in MHN subjects.
In patients recovering from an episode of malignant hyperthermia for which dantrolene has been administered, these side effects should be considered. Although the presence of side effects does not outweigh the usefulness of this drug in treating malignant hyperthermia, it may be a consideration in deciding whether to administer dantrolene prophylactically before surgical procedures in known or suspected MHS patients.
Linkage between acute coronary syndrome and narcotic drug (cocaine) intake was first described by D. Colleman in 1982. However risk of development of acute myocardial infarction during replacement therapy after opioid withdrawal has not been elucidated. The paper contains description of two cases of development of myocardial infarction in young persons with intact coronary arteries who received synthetic opioid methadone for facilitation of heroine discontinuation. These clinical cases should draw attention of physicians to side effects of the use of methadone for the treatment of heroine addiction.
