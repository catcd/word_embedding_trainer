Modulations in the positive hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and its receptor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), occur in rat and human liver tumors. The purpose of this study was to determine if TGF-alpha and EGFR are altered in basophilic and acidophilic preneoplastic and neoplastic liver lesions generated in DEN-initiated mice exposed to a variety of hepatocarcinogens. Female B6C3F1 mice were initiated with N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) and treated with hepatocarcinogenic concentrations of unleaded gasoline vapor (2,000 ppm), methyl tertiary butyl ether vapor (7,814 ppm), phenobarbital (500 ppm, diet), or chlordane (25 ppm, diet). Hepatic foci and tumors were identified and evaluated immunohistochemically with antibodies for TGF-alpha and EGFR. In all treatment groups, basophilic hepatic foci were negative for TGF-alpha immunoreactivity (554/564, 98%). In contrast, regardless of treatment, acidophilic hepatic foci were immunoreactive for TGF-alpha (107/108, 99%). There was no significant difference in mean hepatic labeling index as measured by the incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine between foci immunoreactive and nonimmunoreactive for TGF-alpha. The incidence of immunoreactivity for TGF-alpha increased in hepatocellular tumors that were predominantly of the basophilic phenotype. Of basophilic hepatocellular adenomas, 16/81 (20%) were immunoreactive for TGF-alpha, while 17/29 (59%) of hepatocellular carcinomas stained positive for TGF-alpha. A similar increased incidence of EGFR immunoreactivity was found in basophilic hepatocellular adenomas (17/67, 25%) and carcinomas (19/28, 68%) relative to basophilic foci (11/367, 3%), suggesting an autocrine mechanism for the development of mouse liver tumors. The increased incidence of TGF-alpha immunoreactivity in basophilic liver tumors suggests that TGF-alpha is a marker of tumor progression in mouse liver. Furthermore, TGF-alpha modulations were dependent on phenotype rather than treatment, indicating inherent differences in the expression of TGF-alpha in basophilic and acidophilic hepatic lesions.
Metal ions are required as active components of several proteins, including pancreatic enzymes, and they can play important roles in the etiopathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. In the present study, we measured the concentrations of zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) in both serum and pancreatic tissue, as markers of trace element status in an experimental acute pancreatitis model. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: the experimental group (N=24) and the control group (N=10). Acute pancreatitis was induced by injection of 48% ethyl alcohol into the common biliary duct. The animals were sacrificed 24 h later to detect the concentrations of Zn and Cu. There was no significant difference in tissue Zn and Cu concentrations between control and experimental groups (p<0.05). However, in the acute pancreatitis group, serum Zn and Culevels were very significantly lower (p<0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively). In conclusuion, these findings suggested that altered mineral metabolism in serum and pancreatic tissue may have contributed to the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis.
Barbiturate coma is used in patients with traumatic brain injury whenever increases in intracranial pressure remain unresponsive to less aggressive therapeutic regimens. However, barbiturate-mediated neuroprotection correlates with lymphopenia, which increases the risk of infection. The mechanisms by which barbiturates lead to lymphopenia remain to be determined.
Freshly isolated human lymphocytes and Jurkat cells were incubated with the barbiturate thiopental for 24 and 48 h. Apoptosis was measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin and propidium iodide staining, rhodamine 123 staining, and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling method. Caspase-3 activity was detected by Western blot and substrate cleavage assay.
Thiopental dose-dependently (5-500 microg/ml) increased apoptosis in Jurkat cells from basal levels (4.4 +/- 1.9%) to 29.7 +/- 2.8% after 24 h and 39.7 +/- 3.2% after 48 h, whereas in lymphocytes, thiopental-induced necrosis was observed. Parallel to apoptosis, thiopental dose-dependently increased caspase-3-like activity in Jurkat cells. However, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (20 microm) only marginally reduced thiopental-induced (250 microg/ml) apoptosis in Jurkat cells (20.2 +/- 2.5 to 17.2 +/- 2.5%) and necrosis in lymphocytes (39.2 +/- 7.5 to 30.7 +/- 14%). In contrast, anti-CD95-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (27.0 +/- 2.0%) was completely blocked by z-VAD-fmk (8.1 +/- 1.8%). Neither expression of CD95 on Jurkat cells nor pretreatment with a neutralizing anti-CD95 antibody influenced thiopental-induced apoptosis, indicating that thiopental induces apoptosis independently of the CD95 system. The nuclear factor kappaB inhibitor gliotoxin accelerated both thiopental- and CD95-mediated apoptosis, indicating a mutual control mechanism of thiopental- and CD95-induced apoptosis.
Thiopental directly induces cell death in lymphocytes and Jurkat cells by a CD95-independent mechanism.
The goal of this study was to evaluate whether preoperative pressure pain sensitivity testing is predictive of postoperative surgical pain.
Female subjects undergoing lower abdominal gynecologic surgery were studied. A pressure algometer was used preoperatively to determine the pressure pain threshold and tolerance. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess postoperative pain. A State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to assess patients' anxiety. Subjects received intravenous patient-controlled analgesia for postoperative pain control. The preoperative pain threshold and tolerance were compared with the postoperative VAS pain score and morphine consumption.
Forty women were enrolled. Their preoperative pressure pain threshold and tolerance were 141 +/- 65 kPa and 223 +/- 62 kPa, respectively. The VAS pain score in the postanesthesia care unit and at 24 h postoperatively were 81 +/- 24 and 31 +/- 10, respectively. Highly anxious patients had higher VAS pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit (P < 0.05). Pressure pain tolerance was significantly correlated with the VAS at 24 h postoperatively (P < 0.001, r = -0.52). Pressure pain tolerance after fentanyl administration (mean, 272 +/- 68 kPa) correlated significantly with morphine consumption in the first 24 h postoperatively (P < 0.002, r = -0.48).
Assessment of preoperative pressure pain tolerance is significantly correlated with the level of postoperative pain. Pain tolerance assessment after fentanyl was administered and fentanyl sensitivity predicted the dose of analgesics used in the first 24 h after surgery. The algometer is thus a simple, useful tool for predicting postoperative pain and analgesic consumption.
We report the case of a 17-year-old female patient, scheduled for septoplasty under general anesthesia, who developed ventricular fibrillation after intranasal application of cocaine (350 mg) and submucosal injection of lidocaine (20 mg) with epinephrine (100 micrograms). Resuscitation by external chest compression was successful, and normal sinus rhythm was reestablished after lidocaine injection (50 mg, i.v.). The cardiac risk of the combined administration of cocaine and epinephrine during general anesthesia are discussed.
Quercetin is a naturally occurring dietary flavonol and several reports have shown that quercetin substantially affects cognitive function in disease models, which suggests that quercetin might be a useful agent for treatment of memory dysfunction. However, only one report has examined the effects of quercetin on normal cognitive function. In the present study, we investigated the potential deleterious effects of quercetin on normal cognitive function using Western blot assays and the following behavioral tasks: passive avoidance, Y-maze, and Morris water maze. In the passive avoidance task, pre-acquisition administration of quercetin (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg, p.o.) caused significant cognitive impairments in mice (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Quercetin-treated groups (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg, p.o.) also showed significant memory impairments compared with the control group in the Y-maze task (P < 0.05). In the Morris water maze task, there were no significant differences among the groups during training trial sessions, but at the probe trial session, the quercetin-treated group (40 mg/kg, p.o.) spent significantly less time in the target quadrant than did the control group (P < 0.05). In Western blot assays of hippocampal tissue, we found that quercetin-treated groups showed decreased expression of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), phosphorylated calcium-calmodulin kinase II (pCaMKII), and phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (pCREB). These results suggest that acute administration of quercetin impairs cognitive function by suppression of pAkt and pCaMKII, which, in turn, decreases pCREB expression in the hippocampus.
To determine the effects of Magnesium-Sulphate-pretreatment on Suxamethonium-induced complications (serum potassium rise, fasciculations and apnea). Eighty-four adult patients were selected and randomly allocated into two study groups during induction of general endotracheal anaesthesia. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated with suxamethonium in group A, while in group B magnesium sulphate pretreatment and suxamethonium. Blood sample for serum potassium estimation was taken before induction and at 5 min after induction. Degree of fasciculations and duration of apnea were assessed clinically. Anaesthetic technique and monitoring of patient was standardized. This study showed statistically significant increase in serum potassium of Group A patients {average 0.34 mmol/L} from baseline value p value 0.00. Magnesium sulphate pretreatment significantly reduced suxamethonium-induced hyperkalaemia by an average of 0.3 mmol/L (p-value 0.01). The severity of fasciculations was also significantly reduced (p-value 0.00). There was no significant effect of magnesium pretreatment on duration of apnea during endotracheal intubation (p-value 0.41). Fourteen point six percent (14.6%) of patients that received magnesium pretreatment complained of feeling of heat or warmth but there was no life threatening dysrrhythmias observed in any of the eighteen patients that had continuous ECG monitoring. The study shows that magnesium sulphate pretreatment has significantly reduced suxamethonium-induced hyperkalaemia and severity of fasciculations during induction of general endotracheal anaesthesia, however there was no significant effect on the duration of apnea. The average of 0.034 mmol/L in Group B was not significant {p value 0.06}. We advocate the use of magnesium pretreatment in all patients at risk of these complications.
Redox dysregulation in cancer cells represents a chemical vulnerability that can be targeted by pro-oxidant redox intervention. Dietary constituents that contain an electrophilic Michael acceptor pharmacophore may therefore display promising chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic anti-cancer activity. Here, we demonstrate that the cinnamon-derived dietary Michael acceptor trans-cinnamic aldehyde (CA) impairs melanoma cell proliferation and tumor growth. Feasibility of therapeutic intervention using high doses of CA (120 mg/kg, po, daily, 10 days) was demonstrated in a human A375 melanoma SCID mouse xenograft model. Low-micromolar concentrations (IC(50)< 10 microM) of CA, but not closely related CA derivatives devoid of Michael acceptor activity, suppressed proliferation of human metastatic melanoma cell lines (A375, G361, LOX) with G1 cell-cycle arrest, elevated intracellular ROS, and impaired invasiveness. Expression array analysis revealed that CA induced an oxidative stress response in A375 cells, up-regulating heme oxygenase 1, sulfiredoxin 1 homolog, thioredoxin reductase 1, and other genes, including the cell-cycle regulator and stress-responsive tumor suppressor gene cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, a key mediator of G1-phase arrest. CA, but not Michael-inactive derivatives, inhibited NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and TNFalpha-induced IL-8 production in A375 cells. These findings support a previously unrecognized role of CA as a dietary Michael acceptor with potential anti-cancer activity.
The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan may improve motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and experimental Parkinsonism. We studied the effect of idazoxan on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats, an animal model of the drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects in man. Catalepsy was induced by a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of haloperidol (1 mg/kg) and measured by the bar test for a maximum of 5 min. At 3 h after haloperidol, rats were given 0.16-5.0 mg/kg s.c. idazoxan, and descent latency was measured 1 h later. Idazoxan potently reversed haloperidol-induced catalepsy with an ED(50) of 0.25 mg/kg. This effect was mimicked by the selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist RS-15385-197 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg orally). We assessed how dopaminergic mechanisms were involved in the anticataleptic effect of idazoxan by studying its effect on dopamine (DA) release in the striatum, with the microdialysis technique in conscious rats. Idazoxan (0.3 and 2.5 mg/kg) had no effect on extracellular DA and did not modify the rise of extracellular DA induced by haloperidol, indicating that changes of striatal DA release were not involved in the reversal of catalepsy. The anticataleptic effect of 2.5 mg/kg idazoxan (haloperidol+vehicle 288+/-8 s, haloperidol+idazoxan 47+/-22 s) was attenuated in rats given an intraventricular injection of 150 microg of the serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (haloperidol+vehicle 275+/-25 s, haloperidol+idazoxan 137+/-28 s). The 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100 635 (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) did not affect the anticataleptic effect of idazoxan. The results suggest that idazoxan reversed haloperidol-induced catalepsy by a mechanism involving blockade of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and, at least in part, 5-HT neurons.
We used seven groups of 8-week-old male ICR mice, with 6 mice in each group, to test if aqueous leaf extract of the Thai medicinal plant Thunbergia laurifolia Linn. (TL) protects against lead poisoning. We found that co-treatment with aqueous TL leaf extract did not affect levels of lead in blood and brain of mice given lead in drinking water at 1 g/L for 8 weeks. However, co-treatment with aqueous TL leaf extract at 100mg/kg or 200mg/kg body weight was found to alleviate adverse effects of lead on learning deficit and memory loss, evaluated with water maze swimming test. Further, increased activity of the cell-death marker enzyme caspase-3 was observed in the brain of mice treated with lead, thereby suggesting that the memory loss could be caused by lead-induced loss of neurons in the brain. Co-treatment with aqueous TL leaf extract at 100 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg body weight was found to restore the levels of caspase-3 activity and maintain total anti-oxidant capacity and anti-oxidant enzymes in the brain. TL leaf extract thus reduced neuronal cell death and memory loss caused by lead uptake in mice, and the anti-oxidant activities of the TL leaf extract might account for these effects.
The effects of CCK-8, ceruletide, their non-sulfated forms and CCK-4 on locomotor activity and rearing in mice were examined. CCK-8 and ceruletide, but not their non-sulfated forms and CCK-4, significantly inhibited the behavioral parameters dose-dependently. The inhibitory effects of CCK-8 and ceruletide were similar, but ceruletide acted more slowly and its inhibitory effect continued much longer than CCK-8, suggesting a difference in stability with the chemical structure. The antagonistic effects of ceruletide on behavioral changes induced by DA agonists were also examined. Peripherally injected ceruletide antagonized both methylphenidate- and methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity in mice dose-dependently, whereas it had no dose-related antagonistic effect on methylphenidate-induced stereotyped behavior. Ceruletide also significantly inhibited apomorphine-induced hyperactivity when injected peripherally. However, no obvious dose-response relationship was observed in either intensity or duration of inhibitory action of ceruletide. These findings suggest that ceruletide does not interfere with dopaminergic transmission due to the blockade of postsynaptic DA receptors in the brain. In conclusion, peripheral injection of CCK-8 and ceruletide may affect directly or indirectly dopamine function producing behavioral changes that resemble those of neuroleptics in some respects.
Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is associated with numerous obstetrical, fetal, and developmental complications, as well as an increased risk of adverse health consequences in the adult offspring. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) has been developed as a pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation and is considered to be a safer alternative for women to smoking during pregnancy. The safety of NRT use during pregnancy has been evaluated in a limited number of short-term human trials, but there is currently no information on the long-term effects of developmental nicotine exposure in humans. However, animal studies suggest that nicotine alone may be a key chemical responsible for many of the long-term effects associated with maternal cigarette smoking on the offspring, such as impaired fertility, type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, and respiratory dysfunction. This review will examine the long-term effects of fetal and neonatal nicotine exposure on postnatal health.
Hemorrhagic cystitis is a common complication in children receiving cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapeutic alkylating agent. Acrolein is a urinary metabolite from cyclophosphamide and can induce hemorrhagic cystitis. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of acrolein by intravesical instillation on urinary bladder muscle contractions and pathological alterations in rats. Acrolein instillation significantly increased the muscle contractions of rat bladder detrusor after 1 and 6 h but markedly decreased detrusor contractions after 24 h. Acrolein increased phosphorylated protein kinase C (pan-PKC) expressions in bladders after 1 and 6 h but inhibited it after 24 h. Inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) protein expressions were markedly induced in bladders 24 h after acrolein treatment. Twenty-four-hour acrolein instillation increased the levels of nitrite/nitrate and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the urinary bladder. The iNOS inhibitors significantly inhibited the acrolein-increased nitrite/nitrate levels, but not IL-6 levels. IL-6-neutralizing antibodies effectively inhibited the acrolein-increased NOx levels. The increased detrusor contractions by 1-h acrolein treatment were significantly reversed by the PKC inhibitor RO32-0432, and the decreased detrusor contractions by 24-h acrolein treatment were significantly reversed by the iNOS inhibitor and IL-6-neutralizing antibody. Both the iNOS inhibitor and IL-6-neutralizing antibody effectively reversed the increased iNOS expression, decreased PKC phosphorylation, increased bladder weight, and hemorrhagic cystitis in rats 24 h after acrolein treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that an IL-6-regulated iNOS/NO signaling pathway participates in the acrolein-triggered detrusor contraction inhibition and hemorrhagic cystitis. These findings may help us to find a new strategy to treat cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
The cardioprotective efficacy of zoniporide (CP-597,396), a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform 1 (NHE-1), was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using rabbit models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. In these models, myocardial injury was elicited with 30 min of regional ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. Zoniporide elicited a concentration-dependent reduction in infarct size (EC(50) of 0.25 nM) in the isolated heart (Langendorff) and reduced infarct size by 83% (50 nM). This compound was 2.5- to 20-fold more potent than either eniporide or cariporide (EC(50) of 0.69 and 5.11 nM, respectively), and reduced infarct size to a greater extent than eniporide (58% reduction in infarct size). In open-chest, anesthetized rabbits, zoniporide also elicited a dose-dependent reduction in infarct size (ED(50) of 0.45 mg/kg/h) and inhibited NHE-1-mediated platelet swelling (maximum inhibition 93%). Furthermore, zoniporide did not cause any in vivo hemodynamic (mean arterial pressure, heart rate, rate pressure product) changes. Zoniporide represents a novel class of potent NHE-1 inhibitors with potential utility for providing clinical cardioprotection.
A novel niacin-bound, chromium-based energy formula (EF; InterHealth Nutraceuticals, Benicia, CA) has been developed in conjunction with D-ribose, caffeine, ashwagandha extract (containing 5% withanolides), and selected amino acids. We have assessed the efficacy of oral administration of EF (40 mg x kg body wt(-1) x day(-1)) in male and female rats over a period of 90 consecutive days on the cardiovascular and pathophysiological functions in an isolated rat heart model. After 30, 60, and 90 days of treatment with EF, the hearts of male and female rats were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion and were measured for myocardial ATP, creatine phosphate (CP), phosphorylated AMP kinase (p-AMPK), and heat shock proteins. Myocardial ATP and CP levels were increased in both male and female rats after EF treatment compared with the controls. Western blot analyses were performed to quantify the expression of stress-related proteins such as heat shock proteins (HSP-70, -32, and -25) and are found to be increased in both male and female rats after EF treatment. The p-AMPK level, which is a sensor for the energy state in various cell types, was also found to be increased after treatment with EF in both male and female rats. Aortic flow, maximum first derivative of developed pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, and infarct size were observed after ischemia-reperfusion and found to be significantly improved in EF-treated rats compared with control animals. Thus EF demonstrated long-term safety as well as exhibiting significant cardioprotective ability during ischemia and reperfusion injury by increased energy production, improved cardiac function, and reduced infarct size.
Angiotensin II (Ang II) contributes to vascular pathology in part by stimulating NADPH oxidase activity, leading to increased formation of superoxide (O2-). We reported that O2- levels, NADPH oxidase activity, and expression of the p47phox subunit of NADPH oxidase are increased in human abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Here, we tested the hypothesis that deletion of p47phox will attenuate oxidative stress and AAA formation in Ang II-infused apoE-/- mice.
Male apoE-/- and apoE-/-p47phox-/- mice received saline or Ang II (1000 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1)) infusion for 28 days, after which abdominal aortic weight and maximal diameter were determined. Aortic tissues and blood were examined for parameters of aneurysmal disease and oxidative stress. Ang II infusion induced AAAs in 90% of apoE-/- versus 16% of apo-/-p47phox-/- mice (P < 0.05). Abdominal aortic weight (14.1 +/- 3.2 versus 35.6 +/- 9.0 mg), maximal aortic diameter (1.5 +/- 0.2 versus 2.4 +/- 0.4 mm), aortic NADPH oxidase activity, and parameters of oxidative stress were reduced in apoE-/-p47phox-/- mice compared with apoE-/- mice (P < 0.05). In addition, aortic macrophage infiltration and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity were reduced in apoE-/-p47phox-/- mice compared with apoE-/- mice. Deletion of p47phox attenuated the pressor response to Ang II; however, coinfusion of phenylephrine with Ang II, which restored the Ang II pressor response, did not alter the protective effects of p47phox deletion on AAA formation.
Deletion of p47phox attenuates Ang II-induced AAA formation in apoE-/- mice, suggesting that NADPH oxidase plays a critical role in AAA formation in this model.
A 69-year-old woman developed seizures after cerebral angiography immediately preceded by coronary angiography. The preceding coronary angiography resulted in hyperconcentration, hyperosmolar loading, and overdosing of the nonionic contrast medium. A CT examination demonstrated gyriform enhancement throughout the left cortex and the left basal ganglia. Preloading with contrast material, as in this case, predisposes to disruption of the blood-brain barrier during selective common carotid or vertebral artery injection with nonionic contrast.
Doxorubicin (Dox), an effective anticancer agent, can impair testicular function leading to infertility. The present study aimed to explore the protective effect of propolis extract on Dox-induced testicular injury. Rats were divided into four groups (n=10). Group I (normal control), group II received propolis extract (200 mg kg(-1); p.o.), for 3 weeks. Group III received 18 mg kg(-1) total cumulative dose of Dox i.p. Group IV received Dox and propolis extract. Serum and testicular samples were collected 48 h after the last treatment. In addition, the effects of propolis extract and Dox on the growth of solid Ehrlich carcinoma in mice were investigated. Dox reduced sperm count, markers of testicular function, steroidogenesis and gene expression of testicular 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). In addition, it increased testicular oxidative stress, inflammatory and apoptotic markers. Morphometric and histopathologic studies supported the biochemical findings. Treatment with propolis extract prevented Dox-induced changes without reducing its antitumor activity. Besides, administration of propolis extract to normal rats increased serum testosterone level coupled by increased activities and gene expression of 3ß-HSD and 17ß-HSD. Propolis extract may protect the testis from Dox-induced toxicity without reducing its anticancer potential.
The reproductive toxicity of lead acetate and of a fungicide formulation (Dithane M-45) containing 80% mancozeb was studied on rats. Lead acetate was applied in the feed in the following dose groups: control, 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 mg/kg of diet. The three treatment groups received, in addition to the above doses of lead acetate, 4,500 mg/kg Dithane M-45 in the diet. The method was based on the OECD Guideline for Testing of Chemicals No. 415 (1981). Clinical symptoms and mortality were not found in the parent generation. The body weight of female animals decreased significantly before the pregnancy period. This tendency was also seen in males after the combination treatment. At the two high dose levels a remarkable body weight increase was seen in the female animals during the lactation period. As a result of treatment, decreased body weight of offspring was measured during the lactation period. No gross pathological changes were seen. Histological examination showed general tubulonephrosis in the experimental animals. It can be established that the administration of Dithane M-45 did not enhance the reproductive toxicity of lead acetate.
We report seven cases of patients treated with fluindione, who presented with acute renal failure, associated with clinical features of allergy: poor status, fever, dyspnea, lymphadenopathy and erythroderma. All patients had elevated eosinophil counts. Renal biopsy disclosed in all cases a tubulo-interstitial nephritis with or without granuloma. The responsibility of fluindione, an oral anticoagulant widely used in France could be demonstrated. To our knowledge, there are only three reports of single cases of acute renal failure related to fluindione published so far to date. This serious side effect of fluindione should be recognized.
The paper consists of two parts. A review of the relationship of panic disorder to the phobic states and the treatment of these disorders by means of tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, beta blocking drugs and benzodiazepines. A double blind study of alprazolam and placebo in 118 patients with agoraphobia and panic is presented. In an eight week study alprazolam was found to be significantly superior to placebo in the treatment of panic attacks, phobic avoidance, anticipatory anxiety and general anxiety.
A 30-year-old man with chronic abdominal pain was treated with high doses of hydromorphone intravenously and developed severe and frequent myoclonic contractions. Several medications including lorazepam failed to control the contractions; however, clonazepam in normal doses reduced the myoclonus dramatically.
The capsaicin-induced flux in the primary and secondary hyperalgesic area after pretreating the capsaicin injection site with local ketamine, lidocaine or saline 10 min prior to injection was examined in this study. Twelve healthy volunteers participated in two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over experiments. In the first experiment, the skin on the volar forearm was pretreated with s.c. ketamine or saline, 10 min prior to capsaicin injection. Flux was recorded before and continuously after the injection of capsaicin in the primary and secondary hyperalgesic area. Spontaneous pain, evoked pain and areas of hyperalgesia were measured. In the second experiment, a similar capsaicin test was carried out 10 min after pretreating the skin with s.c. lidocaine or saline. Ketamine reduced flux significantly both in the primary and secondary hyperalgesic area. Lidocaine reduced flux significantly in the primary hyperalgesic area. No effect was observed on flux in the secondary hyperalgesic area. Only lidocaine reduced spontaneous pain, evoked pain and areas of hyperalgesia, whereas ketamine had no effect. Our results suggest that there is no simple and close relation between vascular and sensory reactions to pharmacological manipulation following intradermal capsaicin injection. We propose distinct mechanisms for local lidocaine and ketamine based on the differential effects of local lidocaine and ketamine on flux and pain.
Pharmacokinetic changes of oltipraz were investigated after intravenous and oral administration at a dose of 30 mg/kg to control Sprague-Dawley rats and rats with liver cirrhosis induced by dimethylnitrosamine. After intravenous administration in rats with liver cirrhosis, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time infinity (AUC) was significantly greater (1490 microg min/ml versus 2840 microg min/ml) than that in control rats. This was due to significantly slower total body clearance (CL) (20.2 ml/(min kg) versus 10.6 ml/(min kg)) in the rats. The slower CL was due to significantly slower CL(NR) (20.1 ml/(min kg) versus 10.5 ml/(min kg)) in rats with liver cirrhosis. The significantly slow CL(NR) was due to slower hepatic blood flow rate and significantly slower in vitro intrinsic oltipraz disappearance clearance (CL(int), 77.2 ml/min per whole liver versus 11.5 ml/min per whole liver) because the free (unbound in serum proteins) fraction of oltipraz was significantly greater (15.1% versus 31.3%) in the rats. After oral administration in rats with liver cirrhosis, the AUC was also significantly greater (354 microg min/ml versus 812 microg min/ml) and this was not due to increased absorption in the rats. This also could be due to slower hepatic blood flow rate and significantly slower CL(int) in the rats.
As part of an ongoing, prospective, ABA design, double-blind crossover study of risperidone versus placebo for the treatment of aggressive, destructive and self-injurious behavior in persons aged 6-65 years with mental retardation (MR) and autism, we measured the weight of 19 subjects at each study visit. We compared mean weight gain during the 16-week acute phase and 24-week open maintenance phase with that during the initial and middle placebo phases statistically, using a linear mixed model procedure. Results of the linear mixed model analysis showed that relative weight gain observed during the acute and maintenance drug phases was significantly greater than that observed during the initial and middle placebo phases respectively (p = .0001 and p = .0001). Over approximately a year, children aged 8-12 (n = 5) gained a mean of 8.2 kg (range = 2.7-17.7 kg); adolescents (n = 6) aged 13-16 gained a mean of 8.4 kg (range 3.6-15.5 kg); adults aged 21-51 (n = 8) gained a mean of 5.4 kg (range 0-9.5 kg). Weight gain observed in this controlled study of risperidone treatment in children, adolescents, and adults with MR and autism was significant. It may be greater in this population than in others reported and in this study was not limited to an acute effect only. Rate of weight gain diminished rapidly on tapering and stopping the drug. Further studies are urgently needed, including those incorporating diet and exercise programming.
