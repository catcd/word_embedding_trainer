Anthracycline antibiotics are widely used as anticancer agents. Idarubicin (4-demethoxydaunorubicin; Ida), a semisynthetic derivative of daunorubicin (Dnr) is more potent than the parent compound in vitro and in vivo. The equitoxic dose of Ida in patients is about one-fourth of that of Dnr. We compared these drugs regarding cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and resistance mechanisms in human leukaemic cell lines. Cytotoxicity was studied by means of the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and drug-induced apoptosis by means of the Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate method at similar intracellular concentrations (extracellular concentrations of 0.35 microM for Ida and 1 microM for Dnr). Ida was at least twice as potent as Dnr in MOLT-4, HL60, CEM, and K562 cell lines. It took 8 h for Ida to induce approximately 20% apoptosis, but at least 22 h for Dnr to reach 20% apoptosis at identical intracellular concentration. Ida induces a faster and higher apoptosis rate compared with Dnr. The human chronic myelogenous leukaemia cell line (K562) was selected for resistance to Dnr and Ida with and without verapamil (Ver). Continuous incubation with Dnr, but not with Ida, led to an increased mdr1 gene expression as assessed by real-time PCR. The development of mdr1 gene expression in Dnr-resistant cells could be reversed by the presence of Ver. Ver also reversed the cytotoxicity to Dnr, but not to Ida, in K562/Dnr cells. The results show that Ida is more effective than Dnr in inducing apoptosis and that there are differences in resistance mechanisms between the drugs.
We report on a patient with Graves' disease with radiation retinopathy caused by low-dose irradiation and antithyroid drug-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive vasculitis.
A 38-year-old woman with Graves' disease presented with bilateral blurred vision, microaneurysms, telangiectasia, and macular edema. The patient was examined by ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography, and radiation retinopathy was diagnosed.
The patient had been treated with low-dose irradiation for her Graves' ophthalmopathy a few years earlier. She also had ANCA-positive vasculitis induced by the antithyroid drug (propylthiouracil, PTU) that had been prescribed for her at that time. Because of multiple avascular areas on both retinas, she was treated by intensive retinal photocoagulation to control progressive retinopathy.
The radiation doses used to treat Graves' disease ophthalmopathy are low. Nevertheless, there is still a risk of radiation retinopathy developing in patients with PTU-induced ANCA-positive vasculitis.
Numerous adverse reactions have been attributed to cimetidine, which is understandable in view of the attention and scrutiny the drug has received, its widespread use, and its systemic effects. The reported frequency of side effects has differed considerably but is surprisingly low in all studies. The drug has caused an array of central nervous system disturbances, gynecomastia, and, rarely, hepatotoxicity, interstitial nephritis, bradycardia, hypotension, and even cardiac arrest. The last complication has occurred with rapid-bolus intravenous injection. Blood dyscrasias have also been rare and usually associated with serious underlying disease or multiple drugs, making it difficult to establish cause and effect in most cases. The drug is used widely to treatment conditions for which it is not approved. Some of these conditions are now believed to respond to cimetidine (gastric ulcer); others are known not to respond (acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and acute pancreatitis).
To investigate the antitumor activity of arsenic trioxide on mice experimental liver cancer.
Mice bearing HepA solid and ascitic liver tumor were used in vivo experiments.
The tumor-bearing mice were treated with arsenic trioxide 2.0mg/kg/d and 3.5mg/kg/d intravenously for 7 days. After the administration of arsenic trioxide, the growth of solid tumor were obviously inhibited, the inhibitory rate were 31.63% and 42.13% respectively. Under the inspection of transmission electron microscope, some cells of the solid tumor showed the typically morphological characteristics of apoptosis. The apoptotic cells were detected by in situ TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The immunohistochemical staining showed that the number of bcl-2 protein positive cells decreased, but the number of bax protein positive cells increased. It also showed that arsenic trioxide could significantly prolong the mean survival time in ascitic-tumor-bearing mice, the prolonging rate of life span was 59.29% and 76.69% respectively. The sub-G1 peaks were observed by flow cytometry on the ascitic specimen and the apoptotic rate were 25.98% and 53.17% respectively.
arsenic trioxide has obvious antitumor activity on HepA liver tumor-bearing mice. The mechanism of arsenic trioxide may mainly be inducing liver cancer cells to undergo apoptosis, which may be related to downregulate the expression of bcl-2 genes and upregulate the expression of bax genes.
Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) confer a strong sensitivity to gefitinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR.
We examined EGFR mutations at exons 18, 19, and 21 in tumor tissue from 68 gefitinib-treated, chemorefractory, advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients from the United States, Europe, and Asia and in a highly gefitinib-sensitive non-small cell lung cancer cell line and correlated their presence with response and survival. In addition, in a subgroup of 28 patients for whom the remaining tumor tissue was available, we examined the relationship among EGFR mutations, CA repeats in intron 1 of EGFR, EGFR and caveolin-1 mRNA levels, and increased EGFR gene copy numbers.
Seventeen patients had EGFR mutations, all of which were in lung adenocarcinomas. Radiographic response was observed in 16 of 17 (94.1%) patients harboring EGFR mutations, in contrast with 6 of 51 (12.6%) with wild-type EGFR (P < 0.0001). Probability of response increased significantly in never smokers, patients receiving a greater number of prior chemotherapy regimens, Asians, and younger patients. Median survival was not reached for patients with EGFR mutations and was 9.9 months for those with wild-type EGFR (P = 0.001). EGFR mutations tended to be associated with increased numbers of CA repeats and increased EGFR gene copy numbers but not with EGFR and caveolin-1 mRNA overexpression (P = not significant).
The presence of EGFR mutations is a major determinant of gefitinib response, and targeting EGFR should be considered in preference to chemotherapy as first-line treatment in lung adenocarcinomas that have demonstrable EGFR mutations.
To determine the efficacy and morbidity of intratympanic gentamicin titration therapy on patients with incapacitating unilateral Meniere's disease.
The study consisted of a retrospective chart review and patient interviews. Sixty-eight patients had been followed for a minimum of 24 months and were reported on in an earlier study. Forty-six of these individuals were available for detailed follow-up at 5 years post-gentamicin therapy.
Vertigo frequency, hearing status, personal disability ratings, and tinnitus level before and after gentamicin therapy were measured.
Seventy-four percent of patients showed complete vertigo control and an additional 7% showed substantial vertigo control. There was also significant improvement in personal ratings of social and economic functioning. Overall, the group showed no combined statistically significant changes in any of the hearing parameters.
Intratympanic gentamicin titration therapy provides excellent vertigo control, with a similarly significant improvement in both personal and occupational functioning.
Behavioral effects of setiptiline, a new tetracyclic compound (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-methyl-9H-dibenzo [3,4:6,7] cyclohepta [1,2-C] pyridine maleate), were investigated to determine its pharmacological characteristics as an antidepressant in rats and mice, as compared with amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, and promethazine, a neuroleptic possessing an antihistaminic profile. Setiptiline exerted a weak stimulatory action on ambulation, spontaneous motor-activity, observed by the open field method in rats and potentiated the stimulatory effects of methamphetamine. Setiptiline also shortened the duration of immobility in rats forced to swim and inhibited catalepsy induced by haloperidol, yawning by physostigmine, body shaking as well as head twitch by 5-hydroxytryptophan in combination with Ro4-4602 and body shaking by morphine-withdrawal in rats. On the other hand, the drug did not exhibit an antagonistic effect on the hypothermia produced by reserpine in mice. From the results, it is suggested that setiptiline seems to have antidepressive activities that are pharmacologically dissimilar to those of tricyclic antidepressants.
A patient with acute cerebellar toxicity following systemic high-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) 3 g/m2/12 h for secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia is reported. Initial symptoms of ataxia and dysarthria emerged at 30 g/m2 cumulative dose and persisted without improvement over a ten-week period. Recurrence and worsening of cerebellar symptoms followed further consolidation treatment with high-dose ara-C. Subsequent autopsy showed extensive Purkinje's cell damage in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres. Persistent severe toxicity can occur at total doses less than those generally recognized.
Previously, it was suggested that right ventricular (RV) free wall dysfunction does not necessarily elicit global hemodynamic alterations. This was investigated in a canine model of halothane-induced right coronary artery (RCA) insufficiency.
Two concentrations (0.8% and 1.6% end tidal) of halothane on global and regional RV and left ventricular (LV) performance and on coronary, pulmonary, and systemic hemodynamics were studied in 10 open-chest dogs first before and, subsequently, during critical RCA stenosis.
In the absence of stenosis, halothane caused progressive and comparable depression of regional and global RV and LV function and reduction of RCA flow. Halothane administered during RCA stenosis caused disproportionate decreases in RCA flow and segment shortening and increases in systolic segment lengths in the area supplied by the stenosed RCA that were approximately twice as great as before stenosis. Such severe regional RV dysfunction was not accompanied by greater depression of global RV and LV pump function (systolic pressures and stroke volume).
In the canine heart with its dominant left coronary system, RCA insufficiency (on the basis of halothane-induced hypotension) caused regional RV dysfunction suggesting ischemia that was not accompanied by global hemodynamic alteration.
The world of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) research is awash with prognostic markers. However, very few of the current group play a clearly defined role in the pathology of this disease and even fewer represent a tractable therapeutic target. One such marker that fulfils both of these criteria is the integrin CD49d. This molecule been implicated in the capacity of CLL cells to migrate into lymphoid tissues and there is a CD49d blocking antibody, Natalizumab, currently in clinical trials. Here we carried out the largest multi-centre evaluation of CD49d as a prognostic marker in 652 primary CLL samples. We confirm that CD49d is predictive for time to first treatment (P<0.0001) and overall survival (P<0.0001) and increases the prognostic power of CD38, ZAP-70 and IGHV gene mutation status in concordant cases. Furthermore, CD49d retained independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis. In contrast to previous studies, we showed no correlation between CD49d expression and in vitro resistance to fludarabine in liquid cultures (P=0.28) but CD49d(hi) cells were significantly more resistant than CD49d(lo) cells when assays were carried out on fibronectin-coated plates (P=0.03). Furthermore, we showed for the first time that the expression of CD49d is strongly associated with expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 suggesting a co-ordinated role for these molecules in the trafficking of CLL cells to the lymphoid tissues. Taken together, our data support the introduction of CD49d into routine immunophenotyping panels for CLL and indicate that the therapeutic targeting of this molecule may prove useful in this disease.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) have greatly improved the treatment and prognosis of multiple cancer types. However, unexpected cardiotoxicity has arisen in a subset of patients treated with these agents that was not wholly predicted by pre-clinical testing, which centers around animal toxicity studies and inhibition of the human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) channel. Therefore, we sought to determine whether a multi-parameter test panel assessing the effect of drug treatment on cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological endpoints could accurately predict cardiotoxicity. We examined how 4 FDA-approved TKi agents impacted cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, metabolic status, impedance, and ion channel function in human cardiomyocytes. The 3 drugs clinically associated with severe cardiac adverse events (crizotinib, sunitinib, nilotinib) all proved to be cardiotoxic in our in vitro tests while the relatively cardiac-safe drug erlotinib showed only minor changes in cardiac cell health. Crizotinib, an ALK/MET inhibitor, led to increased ROS production, caspase activation, cholesterol accumulation, disruption in cardiac cell beat rate, and blockage of ion channels. The multi-targeted TKi sunitinib showed decreased cardiomyocyte viability, AMPK inhibition, increased lipid accumulation, disrupted beat pattern, and hERG block. Nilotinib, a second generation Bcr-Abl inhibitor, led to increased ROS generation, caspase activation, hERG block, and an arrhythmic beat pattern. Thus, each drug showed a unique toxicity profile that may reflect the multiple mechanisms leading to cardiotoxicity. This study demonstrates that a multi-parameter approach can provide a robust characterization of drug-induced cardiomyocyte damage that can be leveraged to improve drug safety during early phase development.
Recent data indicate that a significant number of schizophrenic patients are hypercortisolemic and that glucocorticoids are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether behavioural schizophrenia-like changes in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neurodevelopmental model of this brain disorder are associated with alterations in the level of plasma corticosterone, the concentration of glucocorticoid receptors and the amount of the immunophilin FKBP51, the glucocorticoid receptor co-chaperone, in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. We found that the adult offspring of prenatally LPS-treated rats showed a deficit in prepulse inhibition (PPI), an enhancement of amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, an elevated plasma level of corticosterone and a decrease in both the glucocorticoid receptor level in the hippocampus and the FKBP51 concentration in the frontal cortex. Most of these changes were reversed by the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine, whereas chlorpromazine had no effect on PPI but attenuated the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and normalised the hippocampal level of glucocorticoid receptors. The changes in the level of plasma corticosterone and cortical FKBP51 were attenuated by chlorpromazine in female offspring only. This study supports the hypothesis of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity in schizophrenia and suggests that this hyperactivity results from a decrease in the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor level and a decrease in FKBP51 in the frontal cortex.
Chloroprocaine has been associated with severe back pain after epidural anesthesia. Factors proposed to contribute to this problem are: 1) the preservative disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 2) large volumes of chloroprocaine, 3) low pH of chloroprocaine, and 4) local infiltration with chloroprocaine.
Using a prospective, balanced, randomized study design, 100 patients aged 18-65 yr who were undergoing outpatient knee surgery during continuous epidural anesthesia received one of five local anesthetics (all containing epinephrine 1:200,000). Group I received a bolus of 30 ml 2% lidocaine, followed by 10 ml every 45 min. Group II received 15 ml of 3% chloroprocaine (containing EDTA), plus 5 ml every 45 min. Group III received 30 ml of 3% chloroprocaine plus 10 ml every 45 min. Group IV received 30 ml of 3% chloroprocaine (containing metabisulfite as the preservative but no EDTA) plus 10 ml every 45 min. Group V received 30 ml of 3% chloroprocaine with the pH adjusted to 7.3, plus 10 ml every 45 min. After the anesthesia dissipated and before any analgesic agents were given, the patients were asked to rank maximum knee and back pain on a visual analog scale (0-10) and to give a description of back pain. A telephone interview was conducted 24 h after surgery to determine if back pain returned. Back pain scoring was assessed using a verbal analog scale.
After dissipation of anesthesia, the back pain reported by patients fell into two distinct categories. Type 1 pain was described commonly as superficial and localized to the site of needle insertion. There was no difference among groups in incidence of type 1 pain. Type 2 pain was described as deep, aching, burning, and poorly localized in the lumbar region (5% of the patients in group I, 10% in groups II and IV, 50% in group III, and 25% in group V). The incidence of type 2 pain was significantly greater in group III than in groups I, II, or IV. Group III also had a significantly greater mean visual analog scale pain score (types 1 and 2) than all other groups.
Large doses (> or = 40 ml) of chloroprocaine containing EDTA resulted in a greater incidence of deep burning lumbar back pain. Using 25 ml or less of the same solution resulted in an incidence of both types 1 and 2 postepidural anesthesia back pain similar to that in the lidocaine control group.
Depression and fatigue are frequent side effects of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment, and there is compelling evidence that the inflammatory response system (including interleukin-6, IL-6) and the serotonergic system is important in the pathophysiology of such symptoms. Functional polymorphisms in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene (rs1800795) and serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) have been identified as regulating these systems. The present study aimed to determine if these polymorphisms were associated with the development of depression and fatigue during IFN-alpha and ribavirin treatment. Ninety-eight Caucasian patients receiving pegylated IFN-alpha and ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus at King's College Hospital, London, and Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, participated in this prospective cohort study. Symptoms of depression and fatigue were measured before treatment and at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 24 during treatment. The 'low IL-6' synthesizing genotype (CC) was associated with significantly fewer symptoms of depression (effect size = 0.7 at week 24; F = 9.4, d.f. = 436, P = 0.002). The 'high transcription' serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype (LL) was also associated with significantly fewer symptoms of depression, but with a much smaller effect (effect size = 0.2 at week 24; F = 4.5, d.f. = 436, P = 0.03). Neither polymorphisms were associated with symptoms of fatigue (IL-6: F = 1.2, d.f. = 430, P = 0.2; 5-HTT: F = 0.5, d.f. = 430, P = 0.5). The smaller effects of the 5-HTT polymorphism on depression may be explained by an interaction between the genes (F = 5.0, d.f. = 434, P = 0.02): the 'protective' effect of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was evident only in the presence of the 'low IL-6' genotype (F = 5.4, d.f. = 64, P = 0.02), not in the presence of the 'high IL-6' genotype (F = 2.2, d.f. = 369, P = 0.1). The association between the IL-6 polymorphism and reduced risk of depressive symptoms confirms the role of the inflammatory response system in the pathophysiology of IFN-alpha-induced depression; in contrast, the effect of the 5-HTT gene was small and perhaps dependent on the status of the inflammatory response.
There is increasing evidence that genetic factors can influence individual differences in vulnerability to drugs of abuse. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), acting through many receptors can modulate the activity of neural reward pathways and thus the effects of various drugs of abuse. Here we examine the effects of cocaine in mice lacking one of the serotonin-receptor subtypes, the 5-HT1B receptor. We show that mice lacking 5-HT1B display increased locomotor responses to cocaine and that they are more motivated to self-administer cocaine. We propose that even drug-naive 5-HT1B-knockout mice are in a behavioural and biochemical state that resembles that of wild-type mice sensitized to cocaine by repeated exposure to the drug. This altered state might be responsible for their increased vulnerability to cocaine.
The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of throat and voice symptoms in asthma patients using pressurized aerosol, metered-dose, inhaled corticosteroid preparations. A questionnaire was administered to hospital out-patients in an asthma clinic and to a control group attending a diabetic clinic. Two hundred and fifty five consecutive out-patients using pressurized aerosol inhaled corticosteroids and 100 controls were surveyed. One hundred and forty seven (58%) patients taking inhaled steroids reported voice dysphonia or throat symptoms compared with 13% of control patients. Women admitted to symptoms more frequently than men. Throat symptoms were more prevalent in patients using higher doses of inhaled steroid. Aerosol inhaler-induced cough was reported by 87 (34%) patients. Local side-effects were equally prevalent both with beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide aerosol inhalers. The use of a large volume spacing device with either steroid aerosol did not appear to protect against these symptoms. Local side-effects are common in asthmatics taking pressurized aerosol, metered-dose, inhaled steroids.
In 144 patients receiving prolonged treatment with levodopa for Parkinson's disease, an attempt was made to establish possible correlations between the incidence of levodopa-induced dyskinesias and the age of the patient at the onset of the disease, the clinical form of the disease, the duration of symptoms before initiation of the levodopa therapy, the duration of the levodopa therapy and the influence of the concomitant treatment. Levodopa-induced dyskinesia was observed in 92 patients (64%). The age at onset of the disease of patients with dyskinesia was significantly different from the age at onset of those without dyskinesia, the means being 54.8 and 68.9 years respectively. Levodopa-induced dyskinesia occurred less often in the group with preponderant tremor than in those with preponderant bradykinesia (29% vs. 69%). The patients treated with levodopa from the very beginning of their disease were less susceptible to dyskinesia than those who had parkinsonism for some time before receiving levodopa. The influence of the duration of levodopa treatment on the manifestation of dyskinesia could not be confirmed because this side-effect usually appeared during the first year of treatment. The concomitant anti-parkinsonian treatment appeared to have no influence on the incidence of dyskinesia. Biochemical and practical implications of these observations are discussed.
There is accumulating evidence that opioid therapy might not only be associated with the development of tolerance but also with an increased sensitivity to pain, a condition referred to as opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). However, there are no prospective studies documenting the development of opioid tolerance or OIH in patients with chronic pain. This preliminary study in 6 patients with chronic low back pain prospectively evaluated the development of tolerance and OIH. Patients were assessed before and 1 month after initiating oral morphine therapy. The cold pressor test and experimental heat pain were used to measure pain sensitivity before and during a target-controlled infusion with the short-acting mu opioid agonist remifentanil. In the cold pressor test, all patients became hyperalgesic as well as tolerant after 1 month of oral morphine therapy. In a model of heat pain, patients exhibited no hyperalgesia, although tolerance could not be evaluated. These results provide the first prospective evidence for the development of analgesic tolerance and OIH by using experimental pain in patients with chronic back pain. This study also validated methodology for prospectively studying these phenomena in larger populations of pain patients.
Experimental evidence suggests that opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia might limit the clinical utility of opioids in controlling chronic pain. This study validates a pharmacologic approach to study these phenomena prospectively in chronic pain patients and suggests that both conditions do occur within 1 month of initiating opioid therapy.
Poor clinical outcomes in cancer can often be attributed to inadequate response to chemotherapy. Strategies to overcome either primary or acquired chemoresistance may ultimately impact on patients' survival favourably. We previously showed that lower levels of SPARC were associated with therapy-refractory colorectal cancers (CRC), and that upregulating its expression enhances chemo-sensitivity resulting in greater tumour regression in vivo. Here, we examined aberrant hypermethylation of the SPARC promoter as a potential mechanism for repressing SPARC in CRCs and whether restoration of its expression with a demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-Aza) could enhance chemosensitivity. Initially, the methylation status of the SPARC promoter from primary human CRCs were assessed following isolation of genomic DNA from laser capture microdissected specimens by direct DNA sequencing. MIP101, RKO, HCT 116, and HT-29 CRC cell lines were also used to evaluate the effect of 5-Aza on: SPARC promoter methylation, SPARC expression, the interaction between DNMT1 and the SPARC promoter (ChIP assay), cell viability, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. Our results revealed global hypermethylation of the SPARC promoter in CRCs, and identified specific CpG sites that were consistently methylated in CRCs but not in normal colon. We also demonstrate that SPARC repression in CRC cell lines could be reversed following exposure to 5-Aza, which resulted in increased SPARC expression, leading to a significant reduction in cell viability (by an additional 39% in RKO cells) and greater apoptosis (an additional 18% in RKO cells), when combined with 5-FU in vitro (in comparison to 5-FU alone). Our exciting findings suggest potential diagnostic markers of CRCs based on specific methylated CpG sites. Moreover, the results reveal the therapeutic utility of employing demethylating agents to improve response through augmentation of SPARC expression.
From April 1981 to May 1984, 23 patients with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were treated with CEOP (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) or OEPP (vincristine, epirubicin, procarbazine, and prednisone) combination chemotherapy. CR was achieved in 58% and PR in 31% of the patients, giving an overall response rate of 89%. Nine of 15 (60%) previously untreated patients with unfavorable histology obtained a CR and 5 a PR. Median relapse-free survival was 33 months; median overall survival has not yet been reached, and the probability of survival for CRs was 91% after 54 months of follow-up. Acute toxicity was quite acceptable, and chronic cardiac toxicity was detected in 6 patients only. In conclusion, epirubicin used in combination chemotherapies induced durable remissions and prolonged survivals in advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
To describe a case of flecainide-induced delirium associated with a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with paroxetine.
A 69-year-old white female presented to the emergency department with a history of confusion and paranoia over the past several days. On admission the patient was taking carvedilol 12 mg twice daily, warfarin 2 mg/day, folic acid 1 mg/day, levothyroxine 100 microg/day, pantoprazole 40 mg/day, paroxetine 40 mg/day, and flecainide 100 mg twice daily. Flecainide had been started 2 weeks prior for atrial fibrillation. Laboratory test findings on admission were notable only for a flecainide plasma concentration of 1360 microg/L (reference range 200-1000). A metabolic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine, which the patient had been taking for more than 5 years, was considered. Paroxetine was discontinued and the dose of flecainide was reduced to 50 mg twice daily. Her delirium resolved 3 days later.
Flecainide and pharmacologically similar agents that interact with sodium channels may cause delirium in susceptible patients. A MEDLINE search (1966-January 2009) revealed one in vivo pharmacokinetic study on the interaction between flecainide, a CYP2D6 substrate, and paroxetine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as well as 3 case reports of flecainide-induced delirium. According to the Naranjo probability scale, flecainide was the probable cause of the patient's delirium; the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicates a possible pharmacokinetic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine.
Supratherapeutic flecainide plasma concentrations may cause delirium. Because toxicity may occur when flecainide is prescribed with paroxetine and other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, flecainide plasma concentrations should be monitored closely with commencement of CYP2D6 inhibitors.
In this double-blinded, randomized, multicenter study, we examined analgesic efficacy and tolerability of tramadol in postoperative pediatric patients. Eighty-one postsurgical ASA physical status I and II patients ages 7-16 yr received oral tramadol (approximately 1 or 2 mg/kg) for postoperative analgesia when they were ready to transition from morphine patient-controlled analgesia to oral analgesics. Rescue analgesia consisted of morphine patient-controlled analgesia or an oral equivalent dose of oxycodone. Patients rated their pain just before the administration of tramadol and at regular intervals for 8 h afterwards using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale. The 2-mg/kg group required approximately half as much rescue analgesia as the 1-mg/kg group (P = 0.006). Parents rated the larger dose more favorably. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity (vomiting [10%], nausea [9%], pruritus [7%], rash [4%]) and similar between the two treatment groups. There were no significant changes in hemodynamic variables, respiratory rate, or SpO(2) percentages between the two treatment groups or in all patients compared with pretreatment values.
Oral tramadol 1-2 mg/kg is well tolerated and effective in postoperative children ready to transition from morphine patient-controlled analgesia. The group receiving 2 mg/kg required less rescue analgesic compared with those receiving 1 mg/kg.
Advanced hepatic fibrosis is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition, where collagen and proteoglycans are the main constituents of scar tissue. In previous studies, we showed that heparanase, a heparan sulfate-degrading enzyme, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) play an important role during liver development and remodeling. In this communication, we investigated the relationship between heparanase and VEGF in thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Our study shows that heparanase mRNA expression levels correlate with those of VEGF during the induction and recovery stages of liver fibrosis. We further demonstrated that treating fibrotic rat livers with halofuginone (HF), a multipotent antifibrogenic drug, and subsequently subjecting them to hydrodynamics-based transfection with human VEGF-165 resulted in elevated expression of heparanase mRNA. Moreover, these rats demonstrated an improved capacity to regenerate following 70% partial hepatectomy. In vitro, HF stimulated heparanase and VEGF mRNA expression in hepatic stellate cells. Taken together, our results suggest that in addition to the known multiple functions of HF, it also enhances heparanase and VEGF expression and promotes liver regeneration. Accordingly, HF seems to possess ideal properties required to become an excellent antifibrogenic agent in humans.
