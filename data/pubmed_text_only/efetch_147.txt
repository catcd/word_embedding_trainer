Deaths from microcystin toxication have widely been attributed to hypovolemic shock due to hepatic interstitial hemorrhage, while some recent studies suggest that cardiogenic complication is also involved. So far, information on cardiotoxic effects of MC has been rare and the underlying mechanism is still puzzling. The present study examined toxic effects of microcystins on heart muscle of rats intravenously injected with extracted MC at two doses, 0.16LD(50) (14 microg MC-LReq kg(-1) body weight) and 1LD(50) (87 microg MC-LReq kg(-1) body weight). In the dead rats, both TTC staining and maximum elevations of troponin I levels confirmed myocardial infarction after MC exposure, besides a serious interstitial hemorrhage in liver. In the 1LD(50) dose group, the coincident falls in heart rate and blood pressure were related to mitochondria dysfunction in heart, while increases in creatine kinase and troponin I levels indicated cardiac cell injury. The corresponding pathological alterations were mainly characterized as loss of adherence between cardiac myocytes and swollen or ruptured mitochondria at the ultrastructural level. MC administration at a dose of 1LD(50) not only enhanced activities and up-regulated mRNA transcription levels of antioxidant enzymes, but also increased GSH content. At both doses, level of lipid peroxides increased obviously, suggesting serious oxidative stress in mitochondria. Simultaneously, complex I and III were significantly inhibited, indicating blocks in electron flow along the mitochondrial respiratory chain in heart. In conclusion, the findings of this study implicate a role for MC-induced cardiotoxicity as a potential factor that should be considered when evaluating the mechanisms of death associated with microcystin intoxication in Brazil.
Metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely used in industry, cosmetics, and biomedicine.
We examined hazards of several well-characterized high production volume NPs because of increasing concern about occupational exposure via inhalation.
A panel of well-characterized NPs [cerium oxide (CeO₂NP), titanium dioxide (TiO₂NP), carbon black (CBNP), silicon dioxide (SiO₂NP), nickel oxide (NiONP), zinc oxide (ZnONP), copper oxide (CuONP), and amine-modified polystyrene beads] was instilled into lungs of rats. We evaluated the inflammation potencies of these NPs 24 hr and 4 weeks postinstillation. For NPs that caused significant inflammation at 24 hr, we then investigated the characteristics of the inflammation. All exposures were carried out at equal-surface-area doses.
Only CeO₂NP, NiONP, ZnONP, and CuONP were inflammogenic to the lungs of rats at the high doses used. Strikingly, each of these induced a unique inflammatory footprint both acutely (24 hr) and chronically (4 weeks). Acutely, patterns of neutrophil and eosinophil infiltrates differed after CeO₂NP, NiONP, ZnONP, and CuONP treatment. Chronic inflammatory responses also differed after 4 weeks, with neutrophilic, neutrophilic/lymphocytic, eosinophilic/fibrotic/granulomatous, and fibrotic/granulomatous inflammation being caused respectively by CeO₂NP, NiONP, ZnONP, and CuONP.
Different types of inflammation imply different hazards in terms of pathology, risks, and risk severity. In vitro testing could not have differentiated these complex hazard outcomes, and this has important implications for the global strategy for NP hazard assessment. Our results demonstrate that NPs cannot be viewed as a single hazard entity and that risk assessment should be performed separately and with caution for different NPs.
Serine 70 in the loop region of Bcl-2 is specifically phosphorylated by paclitaxel-treatment in tumor cells and BHK cells expressing Bcl-2. The phosphorylation of serine 70 of Bcl-2 (pS70-Bcl-2) peaks 24 to 48 h after paclitaxel treatment and accelerates apoptosis. Phosphorylation is effectively inhibited in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide, which restore cell viability to the same level as control cells not expressing Bcl-2. These results indicate that paclitaxel-induced kinase(s) and/or its activator(s) are synthesized de novo and play an important role in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by phosphorylating Bcl-2. In binding assays using the phosphorylation-specific antibody against pS70-Bcl-2, the induction of serine 70 phosphorylation 70 results in a loss of the binding ability of Bcl-2 to Bax, a pro-apoptotic partner, and induces subsequent cell death. When the pS70-Bcl-2 antibody was added to human breast cancer tissue, serine 70 phosphorylation was also detected, even prior to treatment with anticancer agents. Further study of breast cancers revealed 83% of tumors with high pS70-Bcl-2 expression responded to paclitaxel or docetaxel treatment, whereas 57% of those with low expression not respond. These findings suggest that pS70-Bcl-2 might be a predictive factor for prognosis and sensitivity to paclitaxel treatment for breast cancer.
Blood pressure should be controlled over 24 h to reduce or prevent cardiac hypertrophy and reduce the prevalence of sudden death, myocardial infarction and myocardial ischaemia at the time of the morning rise in blood pressure. Anti-hypertensive medication is usually given once-daily in the morning and the dose is titrated on the basis of post-dose (peak) blood pressure. This frequently leads to inadequate control prior to the next drug dose unless drugs with appropriate pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics are used. ACE inhibitors exhibit an E(max) plasma concentration: blood pressure response relationship, and thus short-acting ACE inhibitors can exert an effect over 24 h if titrated based on pre-dose (trough) blood pressure. However, when titrated in clinical practice on post-dose (peak) blood pressure response, doses are used that are inadequate to control blood pressure for 24 h. ACE inhibitors with appropriate pharmacokinetics such as perindopril can control blood pressure when titrated at peak provided a dose is used (4 or 8 mg) that is known to have a T:P close to 1.0. Shorter-acting ACE inhibitors frequently give inadequate control when titrated at peak. An understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug, coupled with knowledge of the time the drug was taken, together with the time of blood pressure measurements, enables control to be achieved with once-daily therapy even if the drug is titrated at peak response.
The parent phenol of adapalene and its (E)-cinnamic acid analogue were found to induce cancer cell apoptosis but cause adverse systemic effects when administered to mice. In contrast, their respective 5-Cl- and 3-Cl-substituted analogues had their adverse effects mitigated without a comparable loss of cancer cell inhibitory activity. As a result, pharmacologic space in this region of the cinnamic phenyl ring scaffold was explored. Various substituents were introduced, and their effects on cancer cell proliferation and viability were evaluated. Cinnamic acids having 3-Br, CN, NO(2), NH(2), OMe, and N(3) groups had activity comparable to that of 4-[3'-(1-adamantyl)-4'-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid. A comparative molecular field analysis study indicated that introduction of an H-bond acceptor at position 3 of the central phenyl ring would favor inhibition of leukemia cell viability, and docking suggested its hydrogen bonding with a polar group in a small heterodimer partner homology model. The 3-CN, NO(2), NH(2), and OH analogues also inhibited MMTV-Wnt1 murine mammary stem cell viability.
We studied the effect of sulfasalazine on anaphylaxis. Sulfasalazine dose-dependently inhibited systemic anaphylaxis induced by compound 48/80 in rats. Sulfasalazine also inhibited local anaphylaxis activated by anti-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP) IgE. Moreover, sulfasalazine dose-dependently inhibited histamine release in the peritoneal mast cells activated by compound 48/80 or anti-DNP IgE. All of these effects were comparable to those of the disodium cromoglycate (reference drug) tested. When sulfasalazine was added, the level of cAMP in rat peritoneal mast cells transiently and significantly increased about 6-fold compared with that of basal cells. Our studies provide evidence that sulfasalazine may be beneficial in the treatment of anaphylaxis.
Second generation antipsychotics (SGA) are obesitogenic and diabetogenic. Role of ghrelin (RIA), resistin and TNF-alpha (ELISA) in weight gain and insulin resistance (fasting plasma insulin, HOMA, ELISA) was studied in Hungarian psychiatryic patients (n=60) treated with SGA (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, 15 each). After 1 year, 80% of patients became overweight/obese (BMI > 27/30) and 35% (n= 21/60) presented impaired glucose tolerance (13/60) or diabetes (8/60). Ghrelin (1.3 +/- 0.6 ng/ml), resistin (9.8 +/- 3.7 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (5.8 +/- 1.7 pg/ml), insulin (10.4 +/- 7.6 U/ml, HOMA A: 2.5 +/- 1.8, HOMA B: 133 +/- 62.5) were significantly higher in patients than in healthy matched controls. Resistin and TNF-alpha positively correlated with each other, insulin, HOMA, and negatively with ghrelin. Ghrelin contributes to weight gain, resistin and TNF-alpha to insulin resistance. A negative feedback regulation may exist between adipocytokines and ghrelin production. SGA drugs enhance ghrelin production despite the suppressive effect of adipocytokines. All four SGA drugs are equally obesitogenic and diabetogenic.
On the basis of a 1-year double-blind comparative study of doxazosin and atenolol in hypertensive patients, we have previously described sustained and significantly different drug effects on the blood lipid profile. The present paper presents a retrospective analysis of the smoking subgroups for each drug regimen, for both the original 12-month double-blind period and for a further 12-month open-label period. The changes in blood lipids were qualitatively and quantitatively similar in both the smoking subgroup and in the full study population (smokers and non-smokers). In the hypertensive smokers doxazosin increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (+9.4%) and decreased triglycerides (-10.9%) whereas atenolol had the opposite effect, decreasing HDL cholesterol (-5.6%) and increasing triglycerides (+20.7%). The antihypertensive effects of doxazosin (n = 24) and atenolol (n = 23) were comparable over 24 months of treatment. Eighteen (75%) doxazosin and 17 (73.9%) atenolol patients reached the blood pressure goal (sitting diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg with at least a 5-mmHg reduction, or a greater than or equal to 10-mmHg reduction from baseline). As a consequence of the lowered blood pressure and favourable lipid changes, doxazosin decreased the risk of coronary heart disease (as calculated from the Framingham risk equation) by -24.4% (P less than 0.05). However, the calculated risk was not significantly reduced by atenolol (-2.1%). It is concluded that the smoking status of the patient has no obvious implications for the safety, efficacy or metabolic effects of doxazosin.
Many prescribed drugs can cause cutaneous rashes and eruptions, which may present in various forms and severity. Most of these reactions are mild; however, the severe cases can lead to life-threatening complications. The most severe of these reactions may include angioedema, acute generalized exanthematous reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. We report two cases wherein the patients developed classical angioneurotic edema on clozapine therapy and improved rapidly when clozapine was stopped.
Taxol produces neuropathic pain with three distinct zones of involvement in the extremities. Most distally is an area of on-going pain and proximal to this is a zone of sensory disturbance but not overt pain. These two areas were confined in all but one case to the glabrous skin of the hands and/or feet. More proximal is an area not recognized by the patients as involved with pain or sensory disturbance yet wherein quantitative sensory tests nevertheless reveal altered sensibility. Impairment of perception to light touch, normally conveyed by myelinated fibers, was dramatically altered in all three areas, being approximately 50-fold greater than normal in areas of pain and sensory disturbance as well as in areas of skin perceived by the patients as not affected. Impairment of perception to sharpness, normally conveyed by small myelinated fibers, was most pronounced in areas of on-going pain, intermediate in areas of sensory disturbance and near baseline in more proximal skin of chemotherapy patients. In contrast to mechanical sensibility, thermal thresholds for warm and heat pain detection were normal throughout. Finally, chemotherapy patients showed paradoxical burning pain to skin cooling that was most pronounced in proximal areas of skin thought to be unaffected by the patients, intermediate in the border zone of altered sensibility and least pronounced in areas of on-going pain. These data suggest that taxol produces a neuropathy characterized by pronounced impairment of function in A-beta myelinated fibers, intermediate impairment of A-delta myelinated fibers, and a relative sparing of C-fibers.
Genetic studies indicate that alcohol consumption associates with expression of the P2rx4 gene, a gene that codes for the P2X(4) receptor. This receptor is a subtype in the purinergic system of ligand-gated ion channels that when activated exerts excitatory effects in CNS. P2X(4) function is inhibited by alcohol and P2X(4) receptors are modulated positively by the antiparasitic agent, ivermectin. Two experiments were performed to test the ability of ivermectin to alter the behavioral effects of alcohol in rats. After alcohol exposure was achieved via the "drinking in the dark" procedure, separate groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to lever press for either alcohol (10% ethanol/2% sucrose) or sucrose (3%) solutions in operant chambers. Rats were tested for maintenance of operant self-administration under a progressive ratio condition (Experiment 1) and for reinstatement of extinguished responding induced by solution presentation (Experiment 2) after ivermectin (0; 1-10mg/kg; IP) administration. Ivermectin decreased the amount of work that the animal performed to obtain reinforcers in the maintenance study, particularly in the group reinforced with alcohol, and tended to decrease reinstated lever press responding. Conditioned approach behavior (head entries) was significantly reduced by ivermectin in both experiments. Reduction in motor activity was seen during the longer maintenance sessions but not in the shorter reinstatement sessions. Results suggest some support for ivermectin-like drugs as potential treatment agents for alcohol dependence. Caution is warranted due to modest specificity on behavior reinforced by alcohol, some reduction in general activity levels, and the lack of dose-response effects.
Paclitaxel (Taxol) is one of the most effective and frequently used chemotherapeutics for the treatment of solid tumours. However, paclitaxel produces peripheral neurotoxicity with patients reporting sensory abnormalities and neuropathic pain during and often persisting after paclitaxel therapy. The mechanisms underlying this dose-limiting side effect are currently unknown and there are no validated drugs for its prevention or control. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received four intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections on alternate days of 2 mg/kg paclitaxel. Behavioural assessment using von Frey filaments and acetone showed that such paclitaxel treatment induced a pronounced mechanical and cold allodynia/hyperalgesia. Thus these studies aim to test potential analgesics on established paclitaxel-induced pain. Paclitaxel-induced pain appears to be relatively resistant to opioid therapy i.p. 4 mg/kg morphine was ineffective and i.p. 8 mg/kg morphine only elicited up to a 50% reversal of mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia. Interestingly, a maximally tolerated dose (i.p. 0.2 mg/kg) of the potent NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 produced no significant reversal of the mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia suggesting that NMDA receptors have little role in paclitaxel-induced pain. Ethosuximide (i.p. 450 mg/kg) an anti-epileptic and relatively selective T-type calcium channel blocker elicited a near complete reversal of mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia. Repetitive dosing with ethosuximide (i.p. 100 or 300 mg/kg daily for 3 days) showed a dose-related consistent reversal of mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia with no evidence of tolerance. Ethosuximide (i.p. 300 mg/kg) also reversed paclitaxel-induced cold allodynia and vincristine-induced mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia. These data suggest that T-type calcium channels may play a role in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and moreover identify ethosuximide as a new potential treatment for chemotherapy-induced pain.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and venlafaxine are often used to treat depression in the elderly due to their low incidence of side effects. All five of the SSRIs currently available and venlafaxine have been associated with hyponatremia.
This article describes the case of an 87-year-old man with depression who presented with hyponatremia after starting treatment with citalopram. After excluding other common causes of hyponatremia, a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) was confirmed. Sodium levels returned to the normal range following discontinuation of citalopram. Subsequently, due to the persistence of depression, treatment with venlafaxine was initiated. Three weeks later, hyponatremia associated with SIADH was once again diagnosed and venlafaxine was discontinued. The hyponatremia resolved in 2 weeks.
Both SSRIs and venlafaxine have been associated with SIADH in numerous case reports and retrospective studies. Risk factors for developing hyponatremia with these drugs are advanced age and treatment with other medications. To our knowledge, this is the first case report in which SIADH was associated with two different families of antidepressants in the same patient.
Physicians should be aware of the risk of hyponatremia when prescribing SSRIs and venlafaxine in elderly patients with multiple drug therapies. Sodium levels should be monitored during treatment.
Patients with malignant mesothelioma (MM), an aggressive cancer associated with asbestos exposure, usually present clinically with advanced disease and this greatly reduces the likelihood of curative treatment. MM is difficult to diagnose without invasive techniques; the development of non-invasively detectable molecular markers would therefore be highly beneficial. DNA methylation changes in cancer cells provide powerful markers that are potentially detectable non-invasively in DNA shed into bodily fluids. Here we examined the methylation status of 28 loci in 52 MM tumors to investigate their potential as molecular markers for MM. To exclude candidate MM markers that might be positive in biopsies/pleural fluid due to contaminating surrounding non-tumor lung tissue/DNA, we also examined the methylation of these markers in lung samples (age- or environmentally induced hypermethylation is frequently observed in non-cancerous lung). Statistically significantly increased methylation in MM versus non-tumor lung samples was found for estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1; p = 0.0002), solute carrier family 6 member 20 (SLC6A20; p = 0.0022) and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK; p=0.0003). Examination of associations between methylation levels of the 28 loci and clinical parameters suggest associations of the methylation status of metallothionein genes with gender, histology, asbestos exposure, and lymph node involvement, and the methylation status of leucine zipper tumor suppressor 1 (LZTS1) and SLC6A20 with survival.
Gemcitabine is currently the best treatment available for pancreatic cancer, but the disease develops resistance to the drug over time. Agents that can either enhance the effects of gemcitabine or overcome chemoresistance to the drug are needed for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Curcumin, a component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), is one such agent that has been shown to suppress the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which is implicated in proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance. In this study, we investigated whether curcumin can sensitize pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, curcumin inhibited the proliferation of various pancreatic cancer cell lines, potentiated the apoptosis induced by gemcitabine, and inhibited constitutive NF-kappaB activation in the cells. In vivo, tumors from nude mice injected with pancreatic cancer cells and treated with a combination of curcumin and gemcitabine showed significant reductions in volume (P = 0.008 versus control; P = 0.036 versus gemcitabine alone), Ki-67 proliferation index (P = 0.030 versus control), NF-kappaB activation, and expression of NF-kappaB-regulated gene products (cyclin D1, c-myc, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1, cyclooxygenase-2, matrix metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor) compared with tumors from control mice treated with olive oil only. The combination treatment was also highly effective in suppressing angiogenesis as indicated by a decrease in CD31(+) microvessel density (P = 0.018 versus control). Overall, our results suggest that curcumin potentiates the antitumor effects of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer by suppressing proliferation, angiogenesis, NF-kappaB, and NF-kappaB-regulated gene products.
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the TATA-box binding protein gene. Studies of several polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion diseases have suggested that the expanded polyQ proteins misfold and induce oxidative stress to contribute to cell death. Substantial deficits in peripheral tissues including lymphocytes have been shown and these peripheral abnormalities could also be found in neurons possessing polyQ disease proteins. In this study, we used a lymphoblastoid cell model to investigate the functional implication of SCA17 expanded alleles and assess the potential therapeutic strategies that may ameliorate the effects of expanded polyQ. Proteomics studies of patient/control pairs including two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and immunoblotting were conducted. A total of 8 proteins with reduced expression changes greater than 1.3-fold were identified, including previously reported HSPA5 and HSPA8. Among 6 proteins further semi-quantified by immunoblotting and real-time PCR, the reduced expression of HYOU1, PDIA3, P4HB, NQO1 and HMOX1 was confirmed. Treatment with resveratrol and genipin up-regulated NQO1 and HMOX1 expression and reduced oxidative stress in patients' lymphoblastoid cells. The results illustrate downregulation of proteins involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (HYOU1, HSPA5, PDIA3, and P4HB) and Nrf2-ARE signaling (NQO1 and HMOX1) in SCA17 lymphoblastoid cells. Compounds increasing anti-oxidative activity such as resveratrol and genipin may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for SCA17.
The objective of this case report is to create awareness on restless legs syndrome (RLS) among clinicians working in emergency units.
We describe a case reporting important aggravation of RLS associated with citalopram, 60 mg/day, in a 48-year-old woman who was sent to the emergency unit by her general practitioner. Citalopram was replaced by bupropion, 150 mg/day, and sertraline, 50 mg/day.
Three days later, symptoms of RLS started to diminish and, after 3 weeks, clinical symptoms had disappeared entirely. On 6-month follow-up, the patient did not manifest clinically significant RLS. Ignoring RLS could lead to a worsening of symptoms and could increase the risk for iatrogenic conditions. The prevalence of RLS in the general population is 3-9%; nevertheless, this syndrome is frequently underdiagnosed.
This case report suggests that RLS could be considered as a possible "dopamine-dependent side effect" of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Bupropion could potentially "correct" dopaminergic dysfunction in RLS, and sertraline appears to be the SSRI that provides the least risk of RLS by blocking dopamine reuptake.
Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive drug occasionally indicted as the cause of some episodes of acute cholestasis. The case described confirms the possibility of acute, severe, and reversible cholestatic hepatopathy of iatrogenic (toxic rather than idiosyncratic) origin.
Mouse blood contains four esterases that detoxify organophosphorus compounds: carboxylesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, acetylcholinesterase, and paraoxonase-1. In contrast human blood contains the latter three enzymes but not carboxylesterase. Organophosphorus compound toxicity is due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Symptoms of intoxication appear after approximately 50% of the acetylcholinesterase is inhibited. However, complete inhibition of carboxylesterase and butyrylcholinesterase has no known effect on an animal's well being. Paraoxonase hydrolyzes organophosphorus compounds and is not inhibited by them. Our goal was to determine the effect of plasma carboxylesterase deficiency on response to sublethal doses of 10 organophosphorus toxicants and one carbamate pesticide. Homozygous plasma carboxylesterase deficient ES1(-/-) mice and wild-type littermates were observed for toxic signs and changes in body temperature after treatment with a single sublethal dose of toxicant. Inhibition of plasma acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and plasma carboxylesterase was measured. It was found that wild-type mice were protected from the toxicity of 12.5mg/kg parathion applied subcutaneously. However, both genotypes responded similarly to paraoxon, cresyl saligenin phosphate, diisopropylfluorophosphate, diazinon, dichlorvos, cyclosarin thiocholine, tabun thiocholine, and carbofuran. An unexpected result was the finding that transdermal application of chlorpyrifos at 100mg/kg and chlorpyrifos oxon at 14mg/kg was lethal to wild-type but not to ES1(-/-) mice, showing that with this organochlorine, the presence of carboxylesterase was harmful rather than protective. It was concluded that carboxylesterase in mouse plasma protects from high toxicity agents, but the amount of carboxylesterase in plasma is too low to protect from low toxicity compounds that require high doses to inhibit acetylcholinesterase.
Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. This disease is associated with diminished protective effects of progesterone, which are usually explained by inadequate activation of progesterone receptors and also enhanced pre-receptor metabolism of progesterone. Endometriosis is often treated with progestins, which act as progesterone receptor agonists, although their exact mechanisms of action are not completely understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the progestins medroxyprogesterone acetate, dydrogesterone and dienogest, as well as progesterone, impact on the expression of genes of pre-receptor progesterone metabolism in Z-12 epithelial cell line, a model system of peritoneal endometriosis. Our data demonstrate that these progestins affect local pre-receptor metabolism to a different extent. The most favorable effects were seen for dydrogesterone and dienogest, where the first, dydrogesterone, significantly reduced SRD5A1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 expression, and additionally had a nonsignificant impact on progesterone receptor B (PR-B) protein levels. This might slow down the first step of pre-receptor metabolism, the conversion of progesterone to 5α-dihydroprogestrone by SRD5A1, and it might also affect further reduction of 3-keto and 20-keto groups catalyzed by AKR1C2 and AKR1C3. Similarly favorable effects were seen for dienogest, which promoted significant reduction of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 expression and also showed no effect on PR-B protein levels. Different effects were seen for progesterone, which significantly decreased SRD5A1, PR-B and HSD17B2 protein levels. In contrast, treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate resulted in increased AKR1C1 expression and decreased levels of PR-B, which might lead to enhanced progesterone metabolism and reduced signaling through progesterone receptors. Altogether, our data in this Z-12 cell model suggest that the beneficial effects of treatment with progestin observed in endometriosis patients might arise from decreased pre-receptor metabolism of the protective progesterone by the SRD5A1 and AKR1C enzymes.
Exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants is widespread, with 97% of Americans having detectable levels. Although PBDEs have been associated with reproductive and hormonal effects in animals, no human studies have examined their association with fertility.
This study was designed to determine whether maternal concentrations of PBDEs in serum collected during pregnancy are associated with time to pregnancy and menstrual cycle characteristics.
Pregnant women (n = 223) living in a low-income, predominantly Mexican-immigrant community in California were interviewed to determine how many months they took to become pregnant. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for PBDEs. PBDE concentrations were lipid adjusted and log10 transformed. Analyses were limited to PBDE congeners detected in > 75% of the population (BDEs 47, 99, 100, 153). Cox proportional hazards models modified for discrete time were used to obtain fecundability odds ratios (fORs) for the association of PBDEs and time to pregnancy.
We detected all four congeners in > 97% of women. Increasing levels of BDEs 47, 99, 100, 153 and the sum of these four congeners were all associated with longer time to pregnancy. We observed significantly reduced fORs for BDE-100 [adjusted fOR = 0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-0.9], BDE-153 (adjusted fOR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8), and the sum of the four congeners (adjusted fOR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-1.0). PBDEs were not associated with menstrual cycle characteristics.
We found significant decreases in fecundability associated with PBDE exposure in women. Future studies are needed to replicate and confirm this finding.
To report our experience of a rather uncommon drug interaction, resulting in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
Two consecutive cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome were diagnosed in our service. In both patients the use of macrolides in patients taking Tacrolimus, resulted in high levels of Tacrolimus.
The first patient was a 48 years old female with Bilateral emphysema. She underwent Single Sequential Lung Transplantation. She developed reperfusion injury requiring prolonged stay. Tacrolimus introduced (Day 51). The patient remained well up till 5 months later; Erythromycin commenced for chest infection. High Tacrolimus levels and a clinical diagnosis of HUS were made. She was treated with plasmapheresis successfully. The second case was a 57 years old female with Emphysema & A1 Antithrypsin deficiency. She underwent Right Single Lung Transplantation. A2 rejection with mild Obliterative Bronchiolitis diagnosed 1 year later and she switched to Tacrolimus. She was admitted to her local Hospital two and a half years later with right middle lobe consolidation. The patient commenced on amoxicillin and clarithromycin. Worsening renal indices, high Tacrolimus levels, hemolytic anemia & low Platelets were detected. HUS diagnosed & treated with plasmapheresis.
There are 21 cases of HUS following lung transplantation in the literature that may have been induced by high tacrolimus levels. Macrolides in patients taking Cyclosporin or Tacrolimus lead to high levels. Mechanism of action could be glomeruloconstrictor effect with reduced GFR increased production of Endothelin-1 and increased Platelet aggregation.
Trichloroethene (TCE) exacerbates the development of autoimmune responses in autoimmune-prone MRL +/+ mice. Although TCE-mediated autoimmune responses are associated with an increase in serum immunoglobulins and autoantibodies, the underlying mechanism of autoimmunity is not known. To determine the progression of TCE-mediated immunotoxicity, female MRL +/+ mice were chronically exposed to TCE through the drinking water (0.5 mg/ml of TCE) for various periods of time. Serum concentrations of antinuclear antibodies increased after 36 and 48 weeks of TCE exposure. Histopathological analyses showed lymphocyte infiltration in the livers of MRL +/+ mice exposed to TCE for 36 or 48 weeks. Lymphocyte infiltration was also apparent in the pancreas, lungs, and kidneys of mice exposed to TCE for 48 weeks. Immunoglobulin deposits in kidney glomeruli were found after 48 weeks of exposure to TCE. Our results suggest that chronic exposure to TCE promotes inflammation in the liver, pancreas, lungs, and kidneys, which may lead to SLE-like disease in MRL +/+ mice.
The glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) subunit determines many of the functional properties of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate subtype of glutamate receptor. The roles of untranslated regions (UTRs) in mRNA stability, transport, or translation are increasingly recognized. The 3' end of the GluR2 transcripts are alternatively processed to form a short and long 3'UTR, giving rise to two pools of GluR2 mRNA of 4 and 6 kb in length, respectively, in the mammalian brain. However, the role of these alternative 3'UTRs in GluR2 expression has not been reported. We demonstrate that in the cytoplasm of rat hippocampus, native GluR2 mRNAs bearing the long 3'UTR are mostly retained in translationally dormant complexes of ribosome-free messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP), whereas GluR2 transcripts bearing the short 3'UTR are predominantly associated with actively translating ribosomes. One day after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE), the levels of both long and short GluR2 transcripts were markedly decreased in rat hippocampus. However, GluR2 mRNAs bearing the long 3'-UTRs were shifted from untranslating mRNP complexes to ribosome-containing complexes after SE, pointing to a selective translational derepression of GluR2 mRNA mediated by the long 3'UTR. In Xenopus oocytes, expression of firefly luciferase reporters bearing alternative GluR2 3'UTRs confirmed that the long 3'UTR is sufficient to suppress translation. The stability of reporter mRNAs in oocytes was not significantly influenced by alternative 5' or 3'UTRs of GluR2 over the time period examined. Overall, our findings that the long 3'UTR of GluR2 mRNA alone is sufficient to suppress translation, and the evidence for seizure-induced derepression of translation of GluR2 via the long 3'UTR strongly suggests that a regulatory signaling mechanism exists that differentially targets GluR2 transcripts with alternative 3'UTRs.
A 68-year-old man suffered an acute myocardial infarction while receiving an intravenous infusion of paclitaxel. Coronary angiograms revealed only mild plaquing of the infarct-related artery without significant angiographic obstructions. The authors postulate that paclitaxel may have caused coronary vasospasm and myocardial infarction.
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an unusual trigger for acute coronary syndrome or sudden death, occurring more frequently in relatively young people and mainly in the female sex. The underlying mechanism is not completely understood, but predisposing factors may include metabolism and collagen synthesis disorders. The case of a 34-year-old woman who underwent coronary angiography for acute anterolateral myocardial ischemia after cocaine abuse is reported. Dissection of the left main trunk extending to both proximal descending anterior and circumflex arteries was detected and the patient was promptly and successfully managed with tirofiban hydrochloride infusion and urgent coronary artery bypass grafting.
