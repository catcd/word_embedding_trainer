Two patients who developed severe narcosis and acute renal failure following therapeutic doses of dihydrocodeine are reported. The administration of naloxone produced an increase in respiratory minute volume and an improved level of consciousness. In addition, there was evidence of reversal of their renal failure with an increased urine output and creatinine clearance during the period of naloxone administration. Although the antidiuretic effect of opioids is well documented, opioids have not previously been incriminated in the aetiology of renal failure. The possible mechanism for this is discussed and the risks associated with the administration of dihydrocodeine to patients with renal failure or the elderly are emphasized.
The antiepileptic drug valproic acid is a wellknown teratogenic agent; its main target organ is the neuroepithelium neural tube, although skeletal malformations have also been described. The goal of our investigations was to determine whether there is a direct relationship between high doses of valproic acid and vertebral arch openings. On day 9 of gestation, rats were treated with either 0.3 ml physiologic saline or 600 mg/kg valproic acid (VA) given once in the morning and once in the evening (7 h between doses) for a total of 1200 mg/kg. For the teratological investigations, fetuses were examined at 21 days of gestation. Spina bifida occulta was demonstrated in double-stained fetal skeletons by measuring the distance between the, cartilaginous ends of each vertebral arch. The most important finding was the very high rate of spina bifida occulta observed with this application regimen. Spina bifida aperta was not observed in our study. A low rate of exencephaly was observed in the treated group (3%). The difference between the control and treated groups was statistically highly significant from the first thoracic to fifth sacral level. The effects of VA are most pronounced from thoracic 9 to the upper lumbar region. The largest gap in vertebral arches was found in the first and second lumbar vertebrae in the VA-treated group. These findings suggest that the peak concentration of VA in the maternal plasma and high bolus administration of VA may be more important for spina bifida occulta than the total dose and infusion of VA.
Preliminary studies have suggested that photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) can improve psoriasis and mycosis fungoides, two diseases where normal or malignant T cells play a central role.
To determine if ALA-PDT induces apoptosis and caspase activation in Jurkat cells, a malignant T-cell line.
Jurkat cells were incubated with ALA in the presence of [14C]-thymidine followed by red light exposure. DNA fragmentation was measured 24 hours later with a DNA elution assay. The influence on DNA fragmentation of ALA concentration, time between ALA addition and light exposure, as well as light fluence were studied. The occurrence of oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation was also studied with DNA electrophoresis. Caspase-3-like activity was monitored by measuring Ac-DEVD-AMC hydrolysis.
DNA fragmentation as high as 88% was observed 24 hours after ALA-PDT. The percentage of DNA fragmentation increased with increasing doses of ALA, red light fluence, as well as longer incubation time with ALA. DNA fragmentation was observed as early as 3 hours after ALA-PDT. The presence of apoptosis after ALA-PDT was confirmed by DNA electrophoresis. An increase in caspase-3-like activities was detected following ALA-PDT.
ALA-PDT induces apoptosis and caspase-3-like activation in Jurkat cells.
Endovascular options for therapy for patients with vasospasm after SAH include angioplasty and intra-arterial vasodilator infusion. Preliminary studies of the effects of the calcium channel antagonist verapamil on angiographic vasospasm have yielded mixed and/or qualitative results. In this study, improvement in angiographic vasospasm after intra-arterial verapamil administration is demonstrated with quantitative, blinded methods.
This retrospective observational case series includes 12 patients with vasospasm after SAH who collectively received 16 treatments with intra-arterial verapamil during a 2-year period at our institution. The exclusion criterion was concurrent treatment with angioplasty. Blinded reviewers quantitatively evaluated angiograms from each patient and/or treatment after presentation with SAH and before and after intra-arterial treatment of vasospasm.
Patients were treated with intra-arterial verapamil for vasospasm 9 ± 4 days after SAH with a range from 1 to 16 days. For the 34 arterial distributions treated, the segment with the worst angiographic vasospasm from each arterial distribution averaged 51 ± 13% stenosis, which improved to 29 ± 18% stenosis (P < .001). There was no significant difference in treatment effect in proximal arterial segments, which may be amenable to angioplasty, compared with distal segments (P > .05). There was no significant difference in treatment effect in arterial segments previously subjected to angioplasty compared with other segments (P > .05).
Intra-arterially administered verapamil improves angiographic vasospasm after SAH when administered at 10 ± 3 mg per arterial distribution. Optimal dose, infusion rate, and retreatment interval remain to be determined. Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove efficacy in the treatment of clinical vasospasm.
This case report is about the combined use of modified electroconvulsive treatment and an atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, in the treatment of a 20-year-old man with chronic and refractory catatonic stupor. This patient, with a preexisting diagnosis of autism, posturing, nonverbal communication, and contracture of lower extremities, displaying mutism, akinesia, and an extreme level of rigidity, waxy flexibility, and posturing, was diagnosed as with catatonic stupor. After hospitalization, the disease had progressed despite the treatment with an atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine. Modified electroconvulsive treatment together with olanzapine caused a dramatic clinical improvement. Follow-up outpatient treatment with olanzapine improved his social functions.
Oxidant-mediated apoptosis has been implicated in renal injury due to ischemia reperfusion (IR); however, the apoptotic signaling pathways following IR have been incompletely defined. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of oxidants on cell death in a model of in vitro simulated IR injury in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells by analyzing the effects of a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic, manganese (III) tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride (MnTmPyP). Renal proximal tubular epithelial cells were ATP depleted for 2, 4, or 6 h, followed by 2 h of recovery. We found that MnTmPyP was effective in attenuating cytotoxicity (P<0.001) and decreasing steady-state oxidant levels (P<0.001) and apoptotic cell death (P<0.001) following ATP depletion-recovery. MnTmPyP treatment prevented the early cytosolic release of cytochrome c and increased Bcl-2 protein levels following short durations of ATP depletion-recovery. After longer periods of ATP depletion-recovery, we observed a significant increase in TNF-alpha protein levels (P<0.001) and caspase-8 activation (P<0.001), both of which were decreased (P<0.001) by treatment with MnTmPyP. Our results suggest that oxidant mediated apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway during the early phase of ATP depletion and by activation of the receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway following longer durations of injury.
This open-label study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam for levodopa-induced dyskinesia and its effect on motor functioning and quality of life in Parkinson disease (PD) patients.
PD patients with moderate to severe dyskinesia were enrolled in the study. PD medications were unchanged during the study, and levetiracetam was slowly titrated up to a maximum dosage of 3,000 mg/d over a 2-month period.
There were 9 patients with a mean age of 65 years and mean disease duration of 13 years. Forty-four percent of the subjects withdrew before the end of the study due to adverse events, primarily worsening of PD symptoms and sleepiness. Of the remaining 5 subjects, 1 subject continued levetiracetam after the study with mild improvement in dyskinesia and 4 discontinued levetiracetam due to worsening of PD symptoms and sleepiness.
Levetiracetam is not well tolerated in PD patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia resulting in worsening of PD symptoms, intolerable somnolence, and worsening of dyskinesia in most patients.
To report a patient with tardive tics possibly induced by the atypical neuroleptic drug amisulpride.
A 55-year-old woman developed motor and phonic tics after a prolonged treatment with amisulpride. Tics improved and finally disappeared after amisulpride withdrawal.
Tardive motor and phonic tics should be considered as a possible adverse effect of amisulpride.
Previous studies showed exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) enhances the development of endometriotic lesions. In this study we examined the effects of other polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons on endometriotic proliferation. B6C3F1 female mice were treated via oral gavage a total of five times, with 3 weeks between each dosing, with 0, 1, 3, or 10 micrograms 2,3,7,8,-TCDD/kg body weight (bw); 3 or 30 mg 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153)/kg bw; 100, 300, or 1000 micrograms 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126)/kg bw; 10, 30, or 100 micrograms 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (4-PeCDF)/kg bw; or 2 or 20 mg 1,3,6,8-TCDD/kg at 10 ml/kg bw. Endometriosis was surgically induced during the week of the second dosing. Three weeks following the final dose, the mice were euthanized and endometriotic lesions, whole body, liver, ovaries, uterine horn, and thymus were weighted, and lesion diameters were measured. Lesions, uterine horns, and ovaries were fixed for histopathology and livers were processed for measurement of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity. Both 2,3,7,8-TCDD (1 and 3 micrograms/kg bw) and 4-PeCDF (100 micrograms/kg bw) significantly enhanced the growth of endometrial lesions. No statistically significant increase in endometriotic lesion size was detected in animals treated with either PCB 126 or with the highest dose of 2,3,7,8-TCDD, possibly due to the effects of histologically observed ovarian toxicity. The nondioxin-like compounds, PCB 153 and 1,3,6,8-TCDD, produced no observable effects on endometriosis. Hepatic EROD activity was significantly induced by 2,3,7,8-TCDD, 4-PeCDF, and PCB 126, but not by PCB 153 or 1,3,6,8-TCDD. The results of this study provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon-promoted endometriosis may be Ah receptor mediated.
Twelve patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) (NYHA class III and IV) resistant to digitalis and diuretics were treated with the postsynaptic alpha-blocking agent prazosin (PZ) (3 to 20 mg/day). In 11 patients oral PZ treatment was well tolerated; the agent was discontinued in the remaining patient because of orthostatic dizziness. After 4 weeks of PZ, total systemic vascular resistance decreased from 2245 +/- 792 to 1603 +/- 355 dyn sec cm-5, mean blood pressure declined from 100 +/- 15 to 90 +/- 14 mm Hg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 29 +/- 8 to 25 +/- 9 mm Hg. Cardiac index increased from 1.92 +/- 0.63 to 2.30 +/- 0.41 l/min/m2. The increase of stroke volume index correlated with the fall in peripheral vascular resistance (r = --0.79, p less than 0.01) and the decline in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r = --0.75, p less than 0.05). In parallel, exercise tolerance increased significantly. Four patients improved from functional class IV to II, four from class IV to III, and one from class III to II, while two patients were unchanged. In the eight patients followed for 6 months, the beneficial effects of ambulatory PZ were maintained throughout the expansive observation period. Three patients died as their disease process progressed during the study (sudden death, pneumonia, and post-PZ withdrawal pump failure). Prazosin is a valuable vasodilator for long-term treatment of otherwise refractory congestive heart failure with the agent given in sufficient individualized dosage.
Immunomodulating activity of zosterin was studied. Zosterin is a pectin from sea grass belonging to Zostera with pronounced antibacterial activity and therapeutic efficacy in experimental infections. It was shown that parenteral administration of the drug 24 hours before the antigenic irritation stimulated the humoral and cellular immunity in F1 (CBA X C 57 BL/6) mice: an increase in the number of the antibody cells in the spleen, the DTH and the index of the splenocyte spontaneous proliferation. In the animals treated with injections of zosterin and infected intraperitoneally with a virulent strain of S. enteritidis there was observed a marked increase in migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the abdominal cavity accompanied by an increase in their phagocytic activity. The results suggested the possible use of zosterin as a drug with associated antibacterial and immunomodulating activities.
Verapamil (0.15 mg/kg) intravenously, was administered to 19 patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) undergoing electrophysiological evaluation. Twelve patients had overt Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and seven patients had concealed accessory pathways conducting in the retrograde direction only. Verapamil had a significant effect in delaying conduction and prolonging refractoriness in the atrioventricular (AV) node, but no significant actions on any of the other cardiac tissues that formed the tachycardia circuit in these patients. In particular, it had no significant effects on anterograde or retrograde bypass conduction or refractoriness. Sustained SVT was initiated in 15 patients, and was terminated within 60 to 105 seconds of a 30-second injection of verapamil in 13 patients. Cycle length alternation during SVT was seen in six patients prior to reversion, and spontaneous ventricular complexes (VPCs) were observed following verapamil administration in five patients. Two patients with apparently normal sinus node function showed prolongation of their sinus node recovery times immediately following reversion of SVT by verapamil. Echo zones were assessed before and after verapamil, and sustained or self-terminating SVT could still be induced after the drug in 13 of the 15 patients who had sustained SVT beforehand. It was concluded that intravenous verapamil was effective in terminating sustained SVT in the majority of patients with overt or concealed WPW and that, despite a potential for sinus node depression and the initiation of VPCs, it had no clinically significant side effects. The ability to reinitiate SVT following its administration suggests the need for immediate follow-up with maintenance drug therapy.
Presented here are four cases of catatonic reactions which were felt to be neuroleptic induced. Intravenous lorazepam was rapidly effective in reversing the catatonia and attendant symptoms. Lorazepam's previous uses and pharmacological profile are discussed. Reviewed briefly are catatonia and its neuroleptic-induced forms. Possible mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effect of intravenous lorazepam in these cases are then examined.
This report describes a patient who required 12 anaesthetics over a period of 25 yr. Halothane was used on at least five occasions. The first documented halothane anaesthetic was followed by jaundice. Subsequently, he received at least four halothane anaesthetics, all of which were followed by illness attributable possibly to hepatotoxicity. He also received five nonhalothane anaesthetics, none of which was followed by postoperative illness. This case history shows strong evidence of halothane causing hepatotoxicity. It also shows an inverse relationship between the severity of the disease and the interval between halothane exposures. It is presented as evidence in favour of the advice on using halothane issued by the Committee on Safety of Medicines.
Bupropion is a relatively new and popular medication with seizures as its major side effect. This drug can produce seizures with an overdose. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative importance of this medication as the etiology of new-onset seizures relative to other drugs and new-onset seizures in general. The study design was a retrospective case series. All new onset generalized seizures were evaluated over a 4-year period in subjects 16 years of age and older. Etiologic diagnosis was determined from the neurology consultation and all patients with new-onset seizures were admitted to the hospital as per hospital policy and received a routine chemistry screening and a neuroimaging study as a minimum. The results indicate that 17 of 279 or 6.1% of the new-onset seizures were drug related. After cocaine intoxication (6/279 or 2.2%) and benzodiazepine withdrawal (5/279 or 1.8%) seizures, bupropion (4/279 or 1.4%) was the third leading cause of drug related seizures. In addition, all the bupropion related seizures occurred in patients taking what was considered to be a therapeutic dose or 450 mg/day or less. Sleep deprivation, previous history of attention deficit disorder and bulimia, and previous heavy alcohol use were associated in three of the patients taking bupropion who had seizures. We conclude that although drug related new-onset seizures are not a common cause of seizures overall, bupropion might be a more common cause of drug related new-onset generalized seizures presenting to the Emergency Department than previously thought, occurring in more than one-fifth of this subgroup of cases. Possibly, greater exclusion criteria are needed than currently recommended for the use of bupropion at therapeutic doses.
Atorvastatin is metabolized through enzymes encoded by members of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A gene family. Some patients who take atorvastatin along with concomitant medications known to inhibit CYP3A enzyme activity (e.g. itraconazole) develop rhabdomyolysis secondary to a severe drug-induced myopathy. The present study aimed to characterize the relationship between CYP3A gene polymorphisms and atorvastatin-induced muscle damage in the context of concomitant medication. The study employed a retrospective case--control (n=137) design. Study subjects were recruited from the general patient population served by Marshfield Clinic, a large horizontally integrated multispecialty group practice located in central Wisconsin, and case assignment was based upon both subjective (myalgia) and objective inclusion criteria [elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels]. The primary outcome was the relationship between serum CK level and CYP3A genotype. CYP3A genotype was not associated with an increased risk for the development of atorvastatin-induced muscle damage. CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*3 allele frequencies were similar in cases (n=68) and controls (n=69). Conversely, CYP3A genotype was associated with an increased severity of atorvastatin-induced muscle damage. An association was identified between the non-functional CYP3A5*3 allele and the magnitude of serum CK elevation in case patients experiencing myalgia. Patients who were homozygous for CYP3A5*3 demonstrated greater serum CK levels than patients who were heterozygous for CYP3A5*3, when concomitant lipid-lowering agents were sequentially removed from the analysis (P=0.025 without gemfibrozil, P=0.010 without gemfibrozil and niacin). The study demonstrates that patients who develop myalgia while taking atorvastatin are more likely to experience a greater degree of muscle damage if they express two copies of CYP3A5*3.
We present a case report describing an interaction between topical timolol maleate, verapamil, and flecainide resulting in symptomatic bradycardia. Adverse drug interactions, including topical medications, are relevant in the differential diagnosis of many presenting complaints.
Reversible valproic acid-induced dementia was documented in a 21-year-old man with epilepsy who had a 3-year history of insidious progressive decline in global cognitive abilities documented by serial neuropsychological studies. Repeat neuropsychological testing 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug revealed dramatic improvement in IQ, memory, naming, and other tasks commensurate with clinical recovery in his intellectual capacity. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms which may have been operative in this case include: a direct central nervous system (CNS) toxic effect of valproic acid; a paradoxical epileptogenic effect secondary to the drug; and an indirect CNS toxic effect mediated through valproic acid-induced hyperammonemia.
A family of orphan transporters has been discovered that are structurally related to the Na(+)-Cl(-)-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, including the dopamine transporter. One member of this family, the mouse XT2 gene, is predominantly expressed in the kidney and has 95% homology to rat ROSIT (renal osmotic stress-induced Na(+)-Cl(-) organic solute cotransporter). To study the physiological functions of this transporter, we generated XT2-knockout mice by gene targeting. XT2(-/-) mice develop and survive normally with no apparent abnormalities. To attempt to identify potential substrates for XT2, we screened urine from XT2-knockout mice by high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry and found significantly elevated concentrations of glycine. To study glycine handling, XT2(+/+) and XT2(-/-) mice were injected with radiolabeled glycine, and urine samples were collected to monitor glycine excretion. After 2 h, XT2(-/-) mice were found to excrete almost twice as much glycine as the XT2(+/+) controls (P = 0.03). To determine whether the absence of the XT2 transporter affected sodium and fluid homeostasis, we measured systolic blood pressure by computerized tail-cuff manometry. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in XT2(-/-) mice (127 +/- 3 mmHg) than in wild-type controls (114 +/- 2 mmHg; P < 0.001). This difference in systolic blood pressure was maintained on high and low salt feeding. To examine whether the alteration in blood pressure and the defect in glycine handling were related, we measured systolic blood pressure in the XT2(-/-) mice during dietary glycine supplementation. Glycine loading caused systolic blood pressure to fall in the XT2(-/-) mice from 127 +/- 3 to 115 +/- 3 mmHg (P < 0.001), a level virtually identical to that of the wild-type controls. These data suggest that the XT2 orphan transporter is involved in glycine reabsorption and that the absence of this transporter is sufficient to cause hypertension.
Merck is adding a warning label to indinavir (Crixivan) as a result of 20 cases of hemolytic anemia reported among the 140,000 people currently using the drug. The disease causes a premature destruction of red blood cells, and the most common symptoms are fatigue, jaundice and discolored urine. The condition progresses rapidly and requires quick treatment. Mild cases are treated by stopping the drug, moderate cases are treated with the corticosteroid prednisone, and severe cases may require blood transfusions.
In order to clarify whether the ovarian tumors induced in a long-term carcinogenicity study of nitrofurazone (NF) in mice can be also produced in a short-term model using transgenic (Tg) mice carrying the human c-Ha-ras gene (rasH2 mice), the following 3 experiments were performed. In experiment 1, both rasH2 mice and their wild CB6F1 littermates carrying no c-Ha-ras gene (non-Tg mice) that were fed a diet containing 500 to 1,000 ppm NF for 7 weeks demonstrated ovarian atrophy characterized by decreased labeling indices (LIs) for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in granulosa cells. In experiment 2, increased numbers of atretic follicles and decreased PCNA LIs in granulosa cells were recognized in rasH2 mice given diets containing 250 or 500 ppm NF for 26 weeks, but no tumor induction was grossly observed. In experiment 3, similar ovarian atrophy was observed in association with increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in both rasH2 and non-Tg mice given diet containing 1,000 ppm NF for 11 days. These results indicate that long-term NF treatment induces ovarian tumors in mice, possibly by continuous stimulation with gonadotropins such as LH via a negative-feedback phenomenon secondary to ovarian atrophy (as the tumor-induction mechanism), although we could not completely rule out a genotoxic mechanism.
Methly-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) mutations cause Rett syndrome in females. Here we report on a male infant with neonatal encephalopathy, myoclonic jerks, and irregular breathing patterns caused by a novel frameshift mutation in the MECP2 gene. In addition he has facial dysmorphisms previously not described in these patients.
1. The peripheral effects of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists were investigated in a model of intestinal inflammation induced by intragastric administration of croton oil (CO). Our hypothesis was that inflammation would 'sensitize' adrenoceptors in peripheral and/or central terminals of myenteric and submucous plexus neurones, and enhance systemic effects of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists. 2. Male swiss CD-1 mice, received intragastrically CO (0.05 ml), castor oil (CA, 0.1 ml) or saline (SS) 3 h before the study: gastrointestinal transit (GIT) was evaluated 20 min afterwards with a charcoal meal. The presence of inflammation was assessed by electron microscopy. 3. The intragastric administration of CA or CO caused an increase in GIT and weight loss, but only CO induced an inflammatory response. Both clonidine (imidazoline1/alpha(2)-agonist) and UK-14304 (alpha(2)-agonist) produced dose-related inhibitions of GIT in all groups. During inflammatory diarrhoea (CO), potencies of systemic (s.c.) clonidine and UK-14304 were significantly increased 3.5 and 2.1 times, respectively, while potencies remained unaltered in the presence of diarrhoea without inflammation (CA). The effects were reversed by administration (s.c.) of receptor-specific adrenoceptor antagonists, but not by naloxone. 4. Clonidine was 8.3 (SS) and 2.8 (CO) times more potent when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), than when administered s.c. Inflammation of the gut did not alter the potency of i.c.v. clonidine, demonstrating that enhanced effects of s.c. clonidine are mediated by peripheral receptors. During inflammation, i.c.v. efaroxan did not antagonize low doses of s.c. clonidine (ED20 and ED50S), but partially reversed ED80S, further supporting the peripheral effects of the agonists in CO treated animals. 5. The results demonstrate that inflammation of the gut enhances the potency of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists by a peripheral mechanism. The results also suggest that the inflammatory response induces an up-regulation or sensitization of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and/or imidazoline receptors.
An early phase II study was conducted to evaluate the anti-tumor effects and toxicity of etoposide in patients with unresectable or relapsed advanced gastric cancer. From April 1991 to December 1992, 13 patients were enrolled into this study; one was subsequently considered ineligible. Before enrollment, all the patients had been treated with chemotherapy which did not include etoposide. Etoposide (100 mg/m2/day) was administered as an intravenous infusion over 120 min for five consecutive days and was repeated every four weeks. Seven patients received one course of this therapy and the remaining five received two. No patient showed a complete or a partial response. No change and progressive disease were observed in three and nine patients, respectively. The clinical toxicities (grade 3-4; WHO) of leukocytopenia, anemia and alopecia occurred in 50, 42, and 42% of the patients, respectively. We conclude that this dose of etoposide administered according to the present schedule is ineffective in previously treated patients with advanced gastric cancer.
