A 78-year-old woman was treated with 40 mg of prednisolone for microscopic polyangitis, and favorable effects were observed. However, her blood pressure increased and she developed severe thrombocytopenia. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) due to malignant hypertension was suspected and she was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; her platelet count then rose. She showed a close temporal relationship between initiation of corticosteroid therapy and the onset of TMA. Corticosteroid therapy should be used with caution in patients with underlying vascular endothelial damage.
The present investigation assessed alterations in mesocorticolimbic cholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA following novel predator and non-predator odor exposure and light-dark testing in CD-1 mice. In brief, acute exposure of CD-1 mice to the predator odor, 2,5-dihydro-2, 4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT; the major component of the anal gland secretions of the red fox), or the control odor, butyric acid (BA), suppressed rearing behavior during odor presentation, subsequently induced anxiety in the light dark test, and was associated with increased mesocorticolimbic CCK mRNA relative to saline treated mice. Only mice exposed to TMT displayed elevated freezing behaviors during odor treatment. In the light-dark test, mice exposed to either BA or TMT took longer to reenter the light section of the apparatus and spent less cumulative time in the light relative to mice exposed to saline. The decreased time spent in the light as well as light dark transitions were exaggerated among mice exposed to fox odor. Odor presentation was associated with increased CCK mRNA in mesocorticolimbic sites. Butyric acid was associated with enhanced CCK gene expression in the VTA, while both BA and TMT were associated with increased medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) CCK mRNA levels. Increased CCK mRNA within the VTA and mPFC was evident among mice despite testing in the light-dark box. In contrast, basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) CCK mRNA was enhanced following odor exposure among mice in the light dark test relative only to saline treated mice which demonstrated a natural decrease in BLA CCK mRNA following the light dark test. The differential pattern of CCK mRNA associated with discrete psychogenic stressor manipulations and the provocation of anxiety-like behavior associated with such experiences is discussed.
Two patients are described who developed testicular swelling and pain during treatment with desipramine. The symptoms disappeared when desipramine was discontinued and in one case returned when desipramine treatment was reinitiated. The observations suggest that testicular swelling and pain are side effects of desipramine.
Objective and subjective postural tremor responses at 60 and 120 min after drug treatment were studied in 24 veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received either 5 mg terbutaline, 20 mg metaproterenol, or a placebo in random order. Subjects were fasting, and had not taken theophylline for 15 to 24 h or any oral sympathomimetics for 2 wk. The mean tremor response to terbutaline and metaproterenol was equal at 60 min, but the 120-min response to metaproterenol was less. When the 60- and 120-min responses were averaged, tremor response to terbutaline was significantly greater than that to metaproterenol in a 5 : 4 ratio. Subjective awareness was also greater. These results are consistent with the difference in bronchodilatory potency of the two preparations. That the drug producing the greater tremor could usually be identified by the patient, even at low tremor intensities, is consistent with the hypothesis that perception of tremor is a function of relative rather than absolute increase over basal tremor unless the tremor becomes physically disabling. In general, the individual tremor response was proportional to the extent by which a patient's basal tremor exceeded the minimal basal tremor for the group as a whole. These results fit a model in which the postural tremor derives from beta-sensitive and beta-insensitive cardioballistic and skeletal muscle forces. Variability in tremor response resides principally at the peripheral skeletal beta 2-receptor and its control system.
A 30-year-old man was admitted because of status asthmaticus. He required 7 days of artificial ventilation and was treated with hydrocortisone 1.2 g.day-1 and bronchodilaters. Pancuronium bromide 0.08 mg.kg-1.hr-1 was given for 64 hours for the ease of artificial ventilation. On day 3, severely elevated airway pressure resulted in left pneumothorax and isoflurane 1% was given for the following 2 days. Respiratory muscle weakness was evident 24 hours after discontinuation of pancuronium infusion on day 5 while full 4 twitches of TOF on the adductor pollicis muscle were seen at the time. The respiratory muscle weakness continued for another 3 days and he was extubated on day 8. Serum creatine kinase concentration rose to 2178 U.l-1 on day 6 and returned to normal on day 11. Hematurea, hyperpyrexia and metabolic acidosis were never seen during the course. Acute corticosteroid myopathy was suspected to be the cause of the prolonged respiratory muscle weakness.
A series of unichiral 7-substituted 2-(1'-methyl-2'-pyrrolidinyl)-1,4-benzodioxanes were synthesized and tested for the affinity for the α4β2 and α7 central nicotinic receptors; the 2R,2'S diastereomer of the 7-OH analogue [(R,S)-7], unique in the series, has a high α4β2 affinity (12nM K(i)). N-Demethylation and configuration inversion of the stereocenters greatly weaken its α4β2 affinity, confirming that such a rigid molecule can be considered a new template for α4β2 ligands. Docking analysis showed how (R,S)-7 is capable of strongly and specifically interacting with the amino acidic counterpart of the α4β2 receptor binding site. Further pharmacological characterization demonstrated that (R,S)-7 also has a high affinity for the α6β2 receptor, and in vitro functional tests indicated that it is a potent α4β2 and α6β2 partial agonist, with modest affinity and potency for the α3β4 receptor. Comparison with varenicline, a well-known nicotinic partial agonist used as a smoking cessation aid, interestingly reveals similar nicotinoid profiles.
This 8-week study investigated the effects of increasing dietary Ca2+ content from 1.0% to 3.0% and hypercalcemia induced by oral 1alpha-OH vitamin D3 (1OH-D3, 1.2 microg/kg), on arterial tone in NaCl-hypertensive rats. The high-Ca2+ diet completely prevented the increase in blood pressure induced by the 6.0% NaCl chow, while plasma total Ca2+ and body weight were not different from controls. The 1OH-D3 treatment moderately elevated plasma total Ca2+ and attenuated the NaCl-induced rise in blood pressure, but also impaired weight gain. The tone of isolated mesenteric arterial rings was examined at the end of study. The endothelium-independent relaxations to nitroprusside, isoproterenol, and cromakalim were impaired in NaCl-hypertension. Experiments with NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and tetraethylammonium in vitro suggested that both the nitric oxide- and hyperpolarization-mediated components of endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine were reduced in NaCl-hypertensive rats. All of the impaired relaxations in NaCl hypertension were normalized by concomitant Ca2+ supplementation. The 1OH-D3 treatment did not affect vascular relaxation, but it attenuated maximal contractile responses induced by norepinephrine and KCl by more than 50%. The reduced vasoconstrictor responses could not be explained by increased apoptosis in the vessel wall, but calcification may have played a role, since moderate signs of medial or adventitial calcification were observed in the aortic preparations after the 1OH-D3 treatment. In conclusion, a high-Ca2+ diet, which did not cause hypercalcemia, normalized blood pressure and endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasorelaxation in NaCl-hypertensive rats. In contrast, chronic hypercalcemia induced by 1OH-D3 was associated with moderately lowered blood pressure, possibly because of reduced vasoconstrictor responses in arterial smooth muscle.
Levodopa continues to be the most effective agent for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). But over time, initial benefits decline in efficacy because of a rise in adverse effects such as dyskinesias. The pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) is not completely understood, but it appears to result from deficient regulation by dopamine of corticostriatal glutamatergic inputs leading to a cascade of neurochemical changes in the striatum and the output pathways. In the present study, we examined if the addition of small doses of cabergoline (a long-acting D(2) receptor agonist) to levodopa could prevent LID. The major hypothesis is that sustained activation of postsynaptic D(2) receptors on medium spiny neurons even by small doses of cabergoline could prevent or reduce LID. The minor hypothesis, and the more controversial of the two, is that the long-acting stimulation by small doses of cabergoline could diminish the release of glutamate by the corticostriatal pathway and prevent LID. Eight MPTP-treated monkeys with a long-standing and stable parkinsonian syndrome and having never received dopaminergic agents were used. Two groups of four were treated for 1 month with levodopa/benserazide administered orally (100 mg/25 mg). The second group received in addition a threshold dose of cabergoline (dose ranging from 0.015 to 0.035 mg/kg, SC). During the treatment, we observed LID in the levodopa group but not in the group receiving levodopa+cabergoline. Furthermore, the combination produced a comparable antiparkinsonian effect in terms of quality but prolonged the duration (by 1 to 2 hours) and increased the locomotion (mean for 2 weeks congruent with 104%). Our data suggest that a small dose of a long-acting D(2) agonist combined with high doses of levodopa could be preventive of LID in patients with PD and could be an alternative to using antiglutamatergic agents for this purpose.
Cystitis caused by excretion of cyclophosphamide (CY) metabolites in the urine was prevented by nephrectomy. There was a concomitant increase of CY lesions in brain, eye, and spleen due to the avoidance of urinary losses. Anuria caused by extra- or intrarenal obstruction, or by prerenal deviation of water, also prevented cystis; these procedures enhanced other CY lesions more than nephrectomy did. The data are interpreted to indicate significant production of active CY metabolites by the kidneys, a production which is eliminated by nephrectomy but not by other procedures.
Dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia with 201Tl myocardial perfusion scintigraphy can detect ischemic regions in individuals unable to perform adequate exercise, but it has several limitations. Symptom-limited exercise supplementation to intravenous dipyridamole can potentially overcome them, but the safety and diagnostic accuracy for this combination has not been established. Between 1987 and 1991, 441 consecutive patients were assessed for combined symptom-limited exercise test preceded by i.v. dipyridamole. Clinical records could not be obtained for 37 patients, and 40 patients were not exercised because they were unable; therefore 384 patients (mean age 58 +/- 9.8 yr, 278 men) underwent symptom-limited exercise preceded by 0.56 mg/kg of dipyridamole and followed by planar 201Tl perfusion scintigraphy. Following dipyridamole infusion, systolic blood pressure fell by 10 +/- 14 mmHg and heart rate increased by 8 +/- 11 bpm. Adverse effects were experienced by 77 people (dizziness in 44; headache in 11; nausea in 9; syncope in 2 and chest pain in 11). Exercise heart rate was 69% +/- 16% of predicted maximum and ST shift was -0.9 +/- 0.9 mm. Following exercise, seven patients required aminophylline (four after dizziness, two after headache, one after chest pain), which was uniformly successful. There were no episodes of prolonged chest pain, MI, death or serious arrhythmia. Safety was maintained for people with severe triple coronary artery disease, the elderly (> 70 yr) and those with significant pulmonary disease. Sensitivity was 95% for at least one with > 70% luminal stenosis and 94% for at least one with > 40% luminal stenosis. Specificity was 28% and 53% respectively. The addition of a symptom-limited exercise test to i.v. dipyridamole is safe for all groups of patients referred for 201Tl study.
Tooth pain often accompanies pulpitis. Accumulation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a product of Gram-negative bacteria, is associated with painful clinical symptoms. However, the mechanisms underlying LPS-induced tooth pain are not clearly understood. TRPV1 is a capsaicin- and heat-gated nociceptive ion channel implicated in thermosensation and hyperalgesia under inflammation or injury. Although TRPV1 is expressed in pulpal afferents, it is not known whether the application of LPS to teeth modulates TRPV1 in trigeminal nociceptors. By assessing the levels of protein and transcript of TRPV1 in mouse trigeminal ganglia, we demonstrate that dentinal application of LPS increases the expression of TRPV1. Our results suggest that the up-regulation of TRPV1 in trigeminal nociceptors following bacterial infection could contribute to hyperalgesia under pulpitis conditions.
Thiamine deficiency (TD) in both humans and experimental animals results in severe mitochondrial dysfunction and leads to selective neuronal cell death in diencephalic and cerebellar structures. We have investigated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in vulnerable (medial thalamus, inferior colliculus) and spared (frontal cortex) regions of rats with thiamine deficiency. Expression of COX-2 mRNA was selectively increased (twofold, p < 0.001) in vulnerable regions at symptomatic stages of encephalopathy (14 days) of TD compared to pair-fed controls or presymptomatic (days 12) rats. Induction of COX-2 expression was accompanied by a significant increase (two- to threefold, p < 0.001) in prostanglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in vulnerable regions at symptomatic stages of TD. COX-2 immunolabeling revealed a neuronal localization and COX-2 immunoreactive neurons were significantly increased at symptomatic stages of encephalopathy. Administration of nimesulide, a highly specific COX-2 inhibitor, significantly reduced PGE-2 levels in vulnerable regions but, rather than being neuroprotective, precipitated encephalopathy and exacerbated neuronal cell death due to TD. These findings suggest that newly synthesized prostanoids exert a neuroprotective role in TD.
Treatment of rats with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol results in cardiac hypertrophy, myocyte necrosis, and interstitial cell fibrosis. Our objectives in this study have been to examine whether hypertrophy and fibrosis occur in a compensatory and reparative response to myocyte loss or whether either process may be occurring independently of myocyte loss and thus be a reactive response to adrenergic hormone stimulation. We have examined this question by evaluating each of these responses in rats treated with different doses and forms of isoproterenol administration. Myocyte necrosis was evaluated using in vivo labeling with monoclonal antimyosin for identification of myocytes with permeable sarcolemma, which was indicative of irreversible injury. Myocardial fibrosis was evaluated by morphometric point counting of Gomori-stained tissue sections and by assessment of the stimulation of fibroblast proliferation by determination of increased levels of DNA synthesis. Stimulation of fibroblast DNA synthesis was determined from DNA specific radioactivities and radioautography after pulse labeling with [3H]thymidine. The evidence provided by this study suggests that the degree and timing of myocardial hypertrophy does not follow the course of myocyte loss and, thus, appears to be either a response to altered cardiac loading or a reactive response to beta-adrenergic hormone stimulation rather than a compensation for myocyte loss. Myocardial fibrosis, on the other hand, appears to be more closely related to myocyte necrosis with respect to collagen accumulation in the same areas of the heart, its dose-response relation to the amount of isoproterenol administered, and the timing of increased DNA synthesis, or fibroblast proliferation, after myocyte loss.
We experienced sudden cardiac arrest after induction of general anesthesia using isoflurane. The patient had had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for one year and had been treated with digoxin and cibenzoline succinate. Sinus rhythm appeared soon after the start of closed chest compression. However cardiac arrest recurred, and we inserted a temporary pacemaker catheter to stabilize the circulatory status. She awoke from anesthesia without any complications. The diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) was made postoperatively and she had a permanent pacemaker implanted. We thought that the hidden SSS had been the cause of this sudden cardiac arrest.
Administration of active vitamin D (calcitriol) improves insulin sensitivity in uraemic patients. These patients have subnormal plasma calcitriol concentrations in parallel with increased intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. It is therefore unclear whether the improvement in insulin sensitivity results from a direct effect of calcitriol or from amelioration of secondary hyperparathyroidism. So far, no evidence has been presented that insulin sensitivity is specifically affected by calcitriol in healthy subjects. We investigated the effect of (supra)therapeutic doses of calcitriol on insulin sensitivity in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind parallel group design, 18 healthy male subjects received in random order either placebo or 1.5 micrograms of calcitriol per day by mouth for 7 days. Insulin-mediated glucose uptake, i.e. insulin sensitivity, was assessed using the euglycaemic clamp technique. Mean glucose disposal rate, i.e. M-value, was not significantly affected by placebo or calcitriol treatment (placebo: 7.1 +/- 1.3 mg kg-1 min-1 before and 7.2 +/- 1.5 mg kg-1 min-1 after treatment; calcitriol 7.0 +/- 1.4 mg kg-1 min-1 and 7.2 +/- 1.4 mg kg-1 min-1). There were no significant changes in mean plasma glucose, insulin, phosphate, bicarbonate and ionized calcium concentrations after administration of placebo or calcitriol. Furthermore, platelet intracellular calcium concentration (assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy) and mean arterial blood pressure (24 h ambulatory measurement) did not change with placebo and calcitriol treatment. On the other hand, mean intact PTH concentration decreased significantly (P < 0.01) with calcitriol treatment, but not with placebo. In addition, mean 24 h urinary calcium excretion increased significantly (P < 0.05) with calcitriol administration but was unchanged with placebo. Administration of (supra)physiological doses of calcitriol has no effect on insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects, despite a significant decrease in PTH concentrations. These observations are compatible with the notion that the effect of calcitriol on insulin sensitivity is present only in uraemic calcitriol-depleted patients.
Risperidone is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone's pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects; features shared by so-called 'atypical' neuroleptics. To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [123I]IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone (n = 12) or haloperidol (n = 7). Both risperidone and haloperidol produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses. There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone. Drug-induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone (42%) and haloperidol (29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%. Based on these observations, it is concluded that 5-HT2 blockade obtained with risperidone at D2 occupancy rates of 60% and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects.
Treatment with indinavir (IDV), a protease inhibitor, is frequently associated with renal abnormalities. We determined the incidence of renal failure (creatinine clearance <80 mL min-1 1.73 (m(2))-1) in HIV patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy, including IDV, and investigated the possible mechanisms and risk factors of IDV nephrotoxicity. Thirty-six patients receiving IDV were followed for 3 years. All were assessed for age, body weight, duration of infection, duration of IDV treatment, sulfur-derivative use, total cholesterol, triglycerides, magnesium, sodium, potassium, creatinine, and urinalysis. We also determined renal function in terms of creatinine clearance, urine osmolality and fractional excretion of sodium, potassium, and water. Urinary nitrate (NO3) excretion was measured in 18 IDV-treated patients and compared with that of 8 patients treated with efavirenz, a drug without renal side effects. Sterile leukocyturia occurred in 80.5% of the IDV-treated patients. Creatinine clearance <80 mL min-1 1.73 (m(2))-1 was observed in 22 patients (61%) and was associated with low body weight and the use of sulfur-derivatives. These patients also had lower osmolality, lower urine volume and a higher fractional excretion of water compared to the normal renal function group. Urinary NO3 excretion was significantly lower in IDV-treated patients (809 +/- 181 microM NO3-/mg creatinine) than in efavirenz-treated patients (2247 +/- 648 microM NO3-/mg creatinine, P < 0.01). The lower NO3 excretion suggests that IDV decreases nitric oxide production.
The effects of chemical sympathectomy and of the injection of amines or amine-receptor blocking drugs on cell proliferation in colonic crypts and in dimethylhydrazine-induced colonic carcinomata is examined in rats using a stathmokinetic technique. In animals which had been chemically sympathectomized by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine cell proliferation essentially ceased in the colonic crypts but continued at a normal rate in the tumours. Stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by metaraminol, a drug with properties similar to noradrenaline, caused acceleration of cell proliferation in colonic crypts but not in tumours. Conversely, blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors by phentolamine inhibited cell proliferation in crypts but not in tumours. Injection of adrenaline, predominantly a beta-adrenergic agonist, inhibited cell proliferation in the tumours but not in colonic crypts whereas blockade of beta-adrenoceptors by propranolol accelerated cell proliferation in tumours but not in colonic crypts. It is postulated that cell proliferation in the crypts of Lieberkühn in rat colon resembles that in rat jejunum in being controlled by the autonomic nervous system. However, tumour cell proliferation does not appear to be subject to such regulation.
Recent data support that iodixanol, an iso-osmolality contrast agent, is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolality contrast agents when hydration is the only prophylactic strategy used. We evaluated the nephrotoxicity of iso- and low-osmolality contrast agents with prophylactic administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) along with hydration.
Two hundred and twenty-five patients with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), referred to our institution for coronary and/or peripheral procedures, were assigned to receive low-osmolality (iobitridol group; N = 115) or iso-osmolality (iodixanol group; N = 110) contrast dye. In all cases prophylactic administration of 0.45% saline intravenously and NAC (1200 mg orally twice daily) was used.
Baseline creatinine levels were similar in the 2 groups [iobitridol group = 1.70 (IQR: 1.54-1.98) mg/dL; iodixanol group = 1.73 (IQR: 1.56-2.00) mg/dL, P = 0.33]. The risk score for contrast nephrotoxicity was 5.0 +/- 1.6 in the iobitridol group versus 5.0 +/- 1.8 in the iodixanol group (P = 0.44). Increase of at least 0.5 mg/dL of the creatinine concentration 48 hours after the procedure occurred in 4/115 patients (3.5%) in the iobitridol group and 3/110 patients (2.7%) in the iodixanol group (P = 1.00; OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.17-3.56). Amount of contrast media administration was similar in the 2 groups (iobitridol group = 167 +/- 90 mL; iodixanol group = 164 +/- 82 mL; P = 0.61).
Nephrotoxicity of iso-osmolality and low-osmolality contrast agents was similar when a prophylactic strategy of hydration plus NAC was utilized.
Among the gastrointestinal adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and corticoids are mentioned complications of colonic diverticular disease. However, very few studies have described their consequences in rheumatoid arthritis.
We report on seven patients who were admitted in our department between 1984 and 1997. All patients received corticoids and another antirheumatic drug (gold salts, hydroxychloroquine, immunosuppressive drugs); treatment also included NSAID in four cases. Two patients had a necrotizing vasculitis accompanying rheumatoid arthritis. Intestinal accompanying diseases were the following: one diverticulitis, three colonic perforations with pelviperitonitis, one colovesical fistula, one pelvic abscess, and one diverticular hemorrhage. All patients underwent surgery with positive results.
Combination of the four following symptoms: fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hemorrhage, can uncover a complication of colónic diverticular disease occurring in the course of rheumatoid arthritis. It should be investigated, even if no history of diverculosis may be evidenced.
Mesalazine is the first line treatment in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There are several reports in the literature about nephrotoxicity (1/150 treated patients), from renal insufficiency to reversible nephritis. It is currently advised to follow creatinine in patients treated with mesalazine during the first 5 years of treatment; however this may reveal the problem too late. As demonstrated in this paediatric case, a high degree of clinical suspicion is needed to diagnose the side effects before irreversible kidney damage occurs. Since the treatment of IBD exacerbation and mesalazine induced interstitial nephritis is based upon steroids, delayed diagnosis of the latter is at risk.
Data from experiments conducted almost exclusively in the rat have established that some phthalates have deleterious effects on the fetal testis probably due to their antiandrogenic and/or estrogenic effects, but their mechanisms of action remain unknown. A recent study reported that phthalates also have deleterious effects on human fetal testis with germ cell number, but not steroidogenesis altered. Therefore, we used organ culture of fetal testes at different stages of development to analyze the direct effects of phthalates on both steroidogenesis and gonocyte development and to determine if the effects of MEHP on these functions reported in the rat can be extended to other mammalian species. We defined specific periods of sensitivity of the fetal mouse testis to MEHP for these two functions and showed that the effects of phthalates on steroidogenesis vary with the developmental stage. Conversely, the strong deleterious effects of phthalates on germ cells were constantly present during the active phases of gonocyte development and thus share no relationship with the steroidogenic status. Moreover, all the effects of phthalates were unchanged in testes from mice deficient for estrogen (ERalphaKO or ERbetaKO) or androgen (Tfm) receptors. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that phthalates impair mouse fetal germ cell number similarly to other mammalian species, but are neither estrogenic nor antiandrogenic molecules because their effects do not involve, directly or indirectly, ER or AR.
N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is a key enzyme for the acetylation of sulfasalazine (SSZ). We examine whether there was a correlation between diplotype configurations (combinations of 2 haplotypes for a subject) at the NAT2 gene and the adverse effects of SSZ used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
The findings from 144 patients with RA who had been treated with SSZ were collected from our outpatient department and used for a retrospective study. Haplotype analysis was performed by the maximum-likelihood estimation based on the EM algorithm using the obtained polymorphism data.
Sixteen patients (11.1%) had experienced adverse effects from SSZ, the most common being allergic reactions including rash and fever. The slow acetylators who had no NAT2*4 haplotype had experienced adverse effects more frequently (62.5%) than the fast acetylators who had at least one NAT2*4 haplotype (8.1%) (p < 0.001, OR 7.73, 95% CI 3.54-16.86). In 25% of the slow acetylators, the adverse effects were so severe that they were hospitalized.
Genotyping the NAT2 gene followed by estimation of diplotype configuration before administration of SSZ is likely to reduce the frequency of adverse effects in Japanese patients with RA.
The natural history and treatment of experimental endocarditis due to heterogeneous and homogeneous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. Amoxicillin/clavulanate or vancomycin were administered for 3 days via a computerized pump to mimic human drug kinetics in animals. After challenge with the minimum inoculum producing 90% of infections (ID90), bacteria in the vegetations grew logarithmically for 16 h. Then, bacterial densities stabilized (at approximately 10(8) cfu/g) and growth rates sharply declined. Both regimens cured > or = 60% of endocarditis (due to heterogeneous or homogeneous bacteria) when started 12-16 h after infection, although the bacterial densities in the vegetations had increased by 20 times in between. In contrast, treatment started after 24 h failed in most animals, while bacterial densities had not increased any more. Thus, while both regimens were equivalent, the therapeutic outcome was best predicted by growth rates in the vegetations, not by bacterial densities. These observations highlight the importance of phenotypic tolerance developing in vivo.
1. Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary hyperkinetic disorder occurring in 20 - 40% of the patient population undergoing chronic neuroleptic treatment is a major limitation of neuroleptic therapy. 2. Oxidative stress and products of lipid peroxidation are implicated in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders including tardive dyskinesia. 3. Chronic treatment with neuroleptics leads to the development of abnormal oral movements in rats known as vacuous chewing movements (VCMs). Vacuous chewing movements in rats are widely accepted as an animal model of tardive dyskinesia. 4. All the antipsychotics were administered i.p. once daily for 21 days, whereas carvedilol (also i.p.) was administered twice daily. Rats chronically treated with haloperidol (1.0 mg kg(-1)) or chlorpromazine (5 mg kg(-1)) but not clozapine (2 mg kg(-1)) significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions. Carvedilol dose dependently (0.5 - 2 mg kg(-1)) reduced the haloperidol or chlorpromazine-induced vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions. 5. Biochemical analysis revealed that chronic haloperidol or chlorpromazine but not clozapine treatment significantly induced lipid peroxidation and decreased the glutathione (GSH) levels in the forebrains of rats. Chronic haloperidol or chlorpromazine but not clozapine treated rats showed decreased forebrain levels of antioxidant defence enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. 6. Co-administration of carvedilol (0.5-2 mg kg(-1)) significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and restored the decreased glutathione levels by chronic haloperidol or chlorpromazine treatment. Co-administration of carvedilol (1-2 mg kg(-1)) significantly reversed the haloperidol or chlorpromazine-induced decrease in forebrain SOD and catalase levels in rats. However, lower dose of carvedilol (0.5 mg kg(-1)) failed to reverse chronic haloperidol or chlorpromazine-induced decrease in forebrain SOD and catalase levels. 7. The major findings of the present study suggest that oxidative stress might play a significant role in neuroleptic-induced orofacial dyskinesia. In conclusion, carvedilol could be a useful drug for the treatment of neuroleptic-induced orofacial dyskinesia.
Qualitative analysis of the literature on cognitive side-effects of lithium in patients with a bipolar disorder identified four of 17 studies that fulfilled criteria of adequate methodological quality. Analysis of these four studies showed that lithium had a negative effect on memory and speed of information processing, often without subjective complaints or awareness of mental slowness. The consequences of these findings for daily practice are discussed, in particular with respect to driving performance. When neurocognitive complaints or deficits are present, lithium plasma level, thyroid functions and degree of mood disturbance should be assessed. In cases where all these parameters are within normal limits and neurocognitive complaints still persist, dose reduction of lithium, thyroid hormone addition, prescription of a slow release preparation or replacement of lithium by another moodstabiliser should be considered. Guidelines are suggested with respect to further neuropsychological screening.
Hypotheses about the information processes impaired in diazepam-induced amnesia were tested by fitting the output from a computer simulation of list learning to observed serial position curves and to overt rehearsal protocols. Twenty-four subjects received an average weight-relative dosage of 0.18 mg/kg oral diazepam; 24 subjects received placebo. Immediate free recall of 16-word lists was examined at 2- and 8-s presentation times. Subjects receiving diazepam recalled significantly fewer words than placebo subjects (diazepam = 6.77 +/- 2.39 words; placebo = 9.29 +/- 1.42 words); their memory impairment was greater at the 8-s than 2-s presentation time. Tests of nonlinear regression models based on computer simulations of list learning performance were consistent with the hypothesis that diazepam reduces rehearsal capacity and disrupts the formation or utilization of contextual and inter-item associations. Among these causes of diazepam-induced amnesia, the disruption of contextual associations appears most important. The results further suggest that quantitative modeling of memory data may complement traditional methods of inferring relationships between brain processes and cognitive dysfunction in amnesic states.
