Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder. There have been several long-term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased. Data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected, and until further information is available, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly alkylating agents, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life-threatening complications.
The carcinogenic potential of the nonsteroidal triphenylethylene antiestrogen toremifene (Fareston) was evaluated in a standard 104-week rat dietary carcinogenicity study. The doses were 0, 0.12, 1.2, 5.0 and 12 mg/kg/day and the number of animals 50/sex/dose group. The body weight gain and food consumption were monitored once weekly (study weeks 1-16) or once every four weeks thereafter (study weeks 17-104). Blood samples were taken at weeks 34, 52 and 104 and the plasma concentrations of toremifene, as well as the two main metabolites (deaminohydroxy)toremifene and N-demethyltoremifene, were measured. All doses of toremifene reduced food intake and body weight gain. Toremifene caused a significant reduction in mortality, which was mainly due to reduced incidences of pituitary tumors. This was evident in all dose groups. Drug-related decrease of mammary tumors in females (at all doses) and testicular tumors in male rats (doses > or = 1.2 mg/kg/day) were also evident. The incidence of the preneoplastic foci of basophilic hepatocytes were significantly decreased in treated female groups. Toremifene induced no preneoplastic or neoplastic lesions. Based on histopathology, no obvious toxicity could be observed. Drug-related changes were observed in the genital organs, thyroid, spleen, mammary gland, adrenal, kidney, stomach and lung. These changes were due to hormonal disturbances or as a result of reduced food consumption or reduced incidences of pituitary, mammary or testicular tumors. This study indicates that toremifene is an efficient antiestrogen in long-term treatment, is well tolerated and has no tumorigenic potential in rats.
Heparan sulfate, the polysaccharide side chain of heparan sulfate proteoglycan, is important for the permselective properties of the glomerular basement membrane. In this report, we show a role for hydroxyl radicals in heparan sulfate degradation and an enhanced glomerular basement membrane permeability. First, in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, exposure of coated heparan sulfate (proteoglycan) to reactive oxygen species resulted in a +/-50% decrease of binding of a monoclonal antibody against heparan sulfate, whereas binding of an antibody against the core protein remained unaltered. Second, on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the molecular weight of heparan sulfate exposed to radicals was reduced which indicates depolymerization. Both in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gel electrophoresis, hydroxyl radicals are instrumental for heparan sulfate degradation as shown by the addition of various radical scavengers. Third, in an experimental model for human nephrotic syndrome (Adriamycin nephropathy in rats), glomerular basement membrane staining of two recently described anti-heparan sulfate antibodies (JM403 and KJ865) was reduced by 24 and 43%. Treatment of Adriamycin-exposed rats with the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea both reduced albuminuria by 37% (p < 0.01) and partly prevented loss of heparan sulfate staining by 53% (JM403) and 39% (KJ865) (p < 0.03). In contrast to the heparan sulfate side chains, the core protein expression and the extent of glycanation did not change in Adriamycin nephropathy. We conclude that glomerular basement membrane heparan sulfate is susceptible to depolymerization by hydroxyl radicals leading to loss of glomerular basement membrane integrity and albuminuria.
Vasopressin and aldosterone are essential hormones in the regulation of water and sodium balance. Aldosterone regulates sodium reabsorption, although synergistic effects on collecting duct water permeability have been shown. We investigated the effects of 7-day aldosterone infusion or oral spironolactone treatment on water balance and aquaporin (AQP) 2 expression in rats with 21 days of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Li-NDI). In rats with Li-NDI, aldosterone markedly increased (271 +/- 14 ml/24 h), whereas spironolactone decreased (74 +/- 11 ml/24 h) urine production compared with rats treated with lithium only (120 +/- 11 ml/24 h). Aldosterone increased free-water clearance and creatinine clearance, whereas spironolactone caused a decreased creatinine clearance but unchanged free-water clearance. Immunoblotting showed unchanged AQP2 expression in cortex/outer stripe of the outer medulla and inner medulla. In the inner stripe of the outer medulla aldosterone caused a decreased AQP2 expression, whereas spironolactone caused an increase compared with rats treated with lithium only. Semiquantitative confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of AQP2 immunolabeling showed reduced AQP2 expression in the apical plasma membrane domain in connecting tubule (CNT) and initial cortical collecting ducts (iCCD) in response to aldosterone-treated rats compared with rats treated with lithium only. Spironolactone significantly increased apical AQP2 expression in the iCCD compared with rats treated with lithium only. We also tested whether similar changes could be observed in vasopressin-deficient BB rats and found similar changes in urine production and subcellular AQP2 expression in the CNT and iCCD in response to aldosterone and spironolactone. This study shows that aldosterone treatment perturbs diabetes insipidus and is associated with AQP2 redistribution in CNT and iCCD likely mediated by the spironolactone-sensitive mineralocorticoid receptor.
Adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media (ICM) are more likely to develop in patients with asthma, a history of allergy or contrast reaction and in those who are debilitated or medically unstable. These reactions can be divided into renal and general, and the latter are subdivided into acute and delayed. Acute general reactions can be minor, intermediate or severe. Fatal reactions are rare. The introduction of low-osmolality agents has caused an overall reduction in the number of non-fatal contrast reactions. Prompt recognition and treatment of acute adverse side effects to ICM is invaluable and may prevent a reaction from becoming severe. Familiarity with cardiopulmonary resuscitation is essential for successful management of life-threatening reactions. Contrast-media-induced renal impairment can be reduced with the use of low-osmolality contrast media and extracellular volume expansion. The use of ICM in diabetic patients receiving metformin should be carried out with care to avoid metformin-induced lactic acidosis. However, this problem is mainly observed in patients with diabetic nephropathy.
A 23-year-old woman with metastatic Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor was treated with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin. Hemolytic uremic syndrome appeared, while no evidence of residual tumor was found. Infusion of fresh frozen plasma together with aspirin and dipyridamole resulted in recovery of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Renal insufficiency, however, persisted.
Statins have different effects beyond cholesterol reduction and stimulate angiogenesis. We investigated the effect of simvastatin in diabetes-related healing defects. An incisional skin wound model produced on the back of female diabetic mice (db(+)/db(+)) and their normoglycemic littermates (db(+)/(+)m) was used. Animals were treated daily either with simvastatin (5 mg/(kgi.p.)) or vehicle. Mice were killed on different days (3, 6 and 12 after skin injury) for measurement of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein expression, to assess histologically the healing process and to evaluate wound breaking strength and angiogenesis by CD31 immunostaining. Simvastatin administration in diabetic mice increased VEGF mRNA (simvastatin=4.8+/-0.6n-fold/beta-actin; vehicle=2.3+/-0.4n-fold/beta-actin) and protein expression (simvastatin=5+/-0.7 integrated intensity; vehicle=2.2+/-0.3 integrated intensity) and enhanced nitric oxide wound content at day 6. Additionally, the statin augmented breaking strength and PECAM-1 immunostaining at day 12. Finally, simvastatin administration restored the impaired wound healing process in diabetic mice. Similar results were obtained in normoglycaemic mice. Passive immunization with anti-VEGF antibody (10 microg/mouse) completely abrogated the beneficial effects of simvastatin on healing in diabetic mice. Simvastatin has potential application in diabetes-related wound healing disorders.
A patient is described who developed frequent blinking and blepharospasm after long-term treatment with trifluoperazine, whose condition improved dramatically after the cessation of the drug. The implications of this for our understanding of the manifestations and natural course of the late-onset side-effects of neuroleptic drugs are discussed. This case further supports the role of dopaminergic mechanisms in the aetiology of Meige's syndrome, which has blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia as its main manifestations.
Two patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), who had no past psychiatric history, developed a mania-like illness soon after commencing treatment with zidovudine. The neurotoxic effects of zidovudine have been described previously, but to our knowledge no reports of a psychiatric disorder that is related to the drug have appeared. Our report emphasizes the need to monitor patients with AIDS for neuropsychiatric problems.
Chronic use of cocaine provokes vasoconstriction and irritation of the upper airway epithelium. These mechanisms can lead to tissue necrosis and perforations.
A 37-year-old woman had major centrofacial necrosis subsequent to chronic inhalation of cocaine. The tissue loss involved the right wing of the right ala nasi, the bony and soft palate and nearly all of the lateronasal walls. A microanastomosed antebrachial fasciocutaneous flap was used for reconstruction of the nasal vault. A classical veloplasty was used to close the palate. Velar competency was improved with a second procedure with Ortricochea sphincter pharyngoplasty. Later loss of the antebrachial flap required salvage with a flap from the lateral border of the tongue which provided a satisfactory functional result.
This case of extended necrosis is rare and treatment was complex. Such treatment can only be undertaken after total and definitive cessation of drug abuse, including tobacco smoking.
Over-expression of DNA repair genes has been associated with resistance to radiation and DNA-damage induced by chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin. More recently, based on the analysis of genome expression profiling, it was proposed that over-expression of DNA repair genes enhances the invasive behaviour of tumour cells. In this study we present experimental evidence utilizing functional assays to test this hypothesis. We assessed the effect of the DNA repair proteins known as X-ray complementing protein 3 (XRCC3) and RAD51, to the invasive behavior of the MCF-7 luminal epithelial-like and BT20 basal-like triple negative human breast cancer cell lines. We report that stable or transient over-expression of XRCC3 but not RAD51 increased invasiveness in both cell lines in vitro. Moreover, XRCC3 over-expressing MCF-7 cells also showed a higher tumorigenesis in vivo and this phenotype was associated with increased activity of the metalloproteinase MMP-9 and the expression of known modulators of cell-cell adhesion and metastasis such as CD44, ID-1, DDR1 and TFF1. Our results suggest that in addition to its' role in facilitating repair of DNA damage, XRCC3 affects invasiveness of breast cancer cell lines and the expression of genes associated with cell adhesion and invasion.
Thirteen patients with bipolar affective illness who had received lithium therapy for 1-5 years were tested retrospectively for evidence of cortical dysfunction. Data on patients younger than 55 show no abnormalities on the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery and suggest that chronic lithium therapy is relatively safe. Significantly elevated Halstead Impairment indexes were observed among elderly patients, but these data are difficult to interpret.
Little is known about the symptom course during and after treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Here we address this question in patients with erosive GERD treated with pantoprazole or esomeprazole 40 mg once daily using the validated reflux questionnaire ReQuest.
Of 585 patients enrolled, 561 (intention-to-treat; ITT) patients with endoscopically confirmed GERD grades A-D (Los Angeles Classification) were randomized. To assess the GERD symptomatology, the patients completed the ReQuest daily, and analysis was done prior to (7 days), during (28 days), and after treatment (7 days). The mean scores (last 3 treatment days) of the subscale ReQuest-GI (gastrointestinal complaints) were compared between both groups. After the end of treatment, the number of symptom episodes and the rate of relapses were calculated.
Noninferiority of pantoprazole versus esomeprazole during treatment was shown (mean ReQuest-GI score). During the posttreatment period, the proportion of patients experiencing a symptomatic relapse (51 vs. 61%, p = 0.0216, ITT) and the number of symptom episodes (0.56 vs. 0.74, p = 0.0095, ITT) were significantly lower on pantoprazole than on esomeprazole.
Pantoprazole 40 mg was at least as effective as esomeprazole 40 mg for relieving GERD symptoms. During the posttreatment phase, patients on pantoprazole had a significantly lower risk to relapse and experienced significantly fewer symptom episodes.
To investigate the effect of benazepril on atrial cytoskeleton remodeling in atrial fibrillation (AF) canines induced by chronic rapid atrial pacing (RAP).
Twenty canines were randomly divided into 3 groups: (1) Sham-operated group without RAP; (2) AF group: AF established by RAP at 600 beats per minute for 6 weeks; (3) Benazepril group: benazepril was dosed from 1 week pre-pacing to 6 weeks post-pacing. The diameter of atrial cardiomyocyte was measured, collagen volume fraction (CVF) analyzed by Masson staining and the expression and distribution of desmin were assayed by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR method was used to semi-quantify the mRNA expression of beta-tubulin and desmin.
The diameter of atrial cardiomyocyte increased in AF group [LA:(27.9 +/- 3.8) microm; RA: (26.8 +/- 3.2) microm] and benazepril group[LA: (25.1 +/- 3.4) microm; RA: (25.2 +/- 3.5) microm] than sham-operated group [LA: (19.6 +/- 2.9) microm; RA: (18.7 +/- 2.6) microm] (P < 0.01). CVF increased in AF group than sham-operated group [LA: (16.9 +/- 1.1)% vs (9.2 +/- 0.9)%, RA: (15.7 +/- 2.3)% vs (9.3 +/- 0.8)%, P < 0.01] and it decreased in benazepril group than AF group [LA: (11.3 +/- 0.8)% vs (16.9 +/- 1.1)%, RA: (10.9 +/- 0.8)% vs (15.7 +/- 2.3)%, P < 0.01]. Normal desmin cross-striations were lost in atrial cardiomyocyte and the desmin organization became irregular in AF group. The A values analyzed by immunohistochemistry of desmin increased in AF group than sham-operated group and they decreased in benazepril group than AF group (P < 0.01). The expression of mRNA level of desmin and beta-tubulin were up-regulated in AF group than sham-operated group, (LA:1.0 +/- 0.3 vs 0.6 +/- 0.3, 0.9 +/- 0.4 vs 0.6 +/- 0.3; RA: 1.0 +/- 0.6 vs 0.6 +/- 0.2, 1.1 +/- 0.3 vs 0.7 +/- 0.4, P < 0.01) and they were down-regulated in benazepril group than AF group (LA:0.8 +/- 0.4 vs 1.0 +/- 0.3, 0.7 +/- 0.3 vs 0.9 +/- 0.4; RA:0.7 +/- 0.3 vs 1.0 +/- 0.6, 0.7 +/- 0.3 vs 1.1 +/- 0.3, P < 0.01).
Benazepril can favorably improve atrial cytoskeleton remodeling in the canine atrial fibrillation model.
This study was undertaken to evaluate the involvement of delta- and kappa-opioid receptors in both ischemia- and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias, and to elucidate some of the plausible mechanisms conferring antidysrhythmic effects on opioid delta- and kappa-receptor agonists and antagonists. Different models of arrhythmia (calcium chloride [CaCl(2)]-, adrenaline-, and ischemia/reperfusion-induced arrhythmias) were employed. The following opioid agonists, antagonists and blockers were used in the study: [D-Ala(2), D-Leu(5)]enkephalin (DADLE), a selective delta-receptor agonist; trans-3,4-Dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide (U-50488H), a selective kappa-receptor agonist; Naltriben Methanesul-fonate (NTB), a selective delta(2)-antagonist with kappa-receptor agonist-like activity; natrindole, a non-selective delta(1)- and delta(2)-receptor antagonist; nor-binaltorphimine dehydrochloride (nor-BNI), a selective kappa-receptor antagonist; chelerythrine, a selective protein kinase C inhibitor, and glibenclamide, a selective blocker of ATP-sensitive K channel. Although results of the morphometric, enzymatic, hemodynamic, electrocardiographic and pharmacodynamic studies undertaken suggest that both opioid delta(1)- and kappa-receptors are involved in the phenomenon of ischemic heart preconditioning (IPC), the antidysrhythmic effects of the opioids seem to be mediated mainly via kappa-receptors. The antidysrhythmic effect of U50488H was found to be a consequence of its beta-blocking activity (which is comparable to that of propranolol, a Class II antiarrhythmic drug) and its ability to prolong myocardial action potential (QT-interval prolongation, which is comparable to that of amiodarone, a Class III antiarrhythmic drug). The antidysrrhythmic effects of the opioid compounds examined were almost completely abolished by glibenclamide or chelerythrine pretreatment. No calcium-channel blocking activity was observed in this investigation. The present observations suggested that opioid receptors displaying well known analgesic properties may have the potential to protect the myocardium during cardiac ischemia at the early stages of myocardial infarction (when early arrhythmias are the most common causes of death).
The Sagg/+ mouse is an ethylnitrosourea-derived mutant with a dermal phenotype similar to some of the subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and cutis laxa. The dermis of the Sagg/+ mouse has less dense and more disorganized collagen fibers compared to controls. The size of extracted Type I dermal collagen was the same as that observed in normal skin; however, more collagen could be extracted from Sagg/+ skin, which also showed decreased collagen content and decreased steady-state levels of alpha1(I), alpha2(I), alpha1(V), and alpha2(V) procollagen mRNAs. The biomechanical properties of Sagg/+ skin were significantly decreased relative to normal skin. However, there were no significant differences in the quantities of the major collagen cross-links, that is, dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine and dehydrohistidinohydroxymerodesmosine between Sagg/+ and normal skin. Electron microscopic evaluation of Sagg/+ skin indicated that the mutation interferes with the proper formation of collagen fibrils and the data are consistent with a mutation in Type V collagen leading to haploinsufficiency with the formation of two sub-populations of collagen fibrils, one normal and one with irregular shape and a larger diameter. Further study of this novel mutation will allow the identification of new mechanisms involved in the regulation of normal and pathologic collagen gene expression.
With increasing doses the highly tumoricidal anthracycline drugs cause heart damage. Based on empirical drug limitations about 10-15% of patients will develop congestive heart failure (CHF) with a mortality of -50% within 2 years on digitalo-diuretic therapy alone. To avoid CHF there is a consensus recommendation that cardiac function should be monitored in close connection with anthracycline administration. As no prospective studies in a larger series have been performed, these recommendations are based on retrospective data on small numbers of patients.
In a prospective, blinded observational study 120 patients with advanced breast cancer were followed before, during, and a median 3 years after treatment with epirubicin. They had 604 serial radionuclide measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that were stored without calculations except in patients who developed a well-defined CHF.
Anthracycline cardiotoxicity was closely correlated with the cumulative dose, with a great variability in individual susceptibility and a dramatic increase with advancing age. With a delayed onset of 3 months or more, epirubicin induced a threatening, slowly progressive deterioration of cardiac function continuing years after treatment. An actuarial estimation of 59% of the patients experienced a 25% relative reduction in LVEF 3 years after 850-1000 mg/m2 of epirubicin and 20% had deteriorated into a CHF. The patients did not spontaneously regain cardiac function whereas continued therapy with a circadian angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for more than 3 months caused a remarkably potent and long-lasting recovery.
Due to the displaced cardiotoxic manifestation, functional monitoring in close connection with anthracycline administration appears to be a poorly effective method while later monitoring is essential. Current monitoring recommendations should therefore be revised.
Chronic use of opioid is associated with pro-nociceptive phenomena such as hyperalgesia or tolerance. The interaction between opioid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with respect to opioid-associated hyperalgesia and tolerance remains largely unknown. This study examines the effect of subcutaneous or intrathecal administration of ketorolac, an NSAID, on recurrent withdrawal induced hyperalgesia and tolerance to spinal morphine in rats. Animals were infused with morphine intrathecally, and daily subcutaneous naloxone was used for recurrent withdrawal purpose. We observed that escape latencies on hot box were decreased in animals subjected to withdrawal, and this decrease was reversed by subcutaneous ketorolac pretreatment. In addition, we observed that recurrent withdrawal did not significantly affect the magnitude of spinal morphine tolerance. Compared to controls, all morphine infused animals showed similar changes in their dose responses to spinal morphine, effective dose 50 values and tolerance ratios; and these changes were not affected by the ketorolac given subcutaneously. The effect of ketorolac on tolerance was further examined by directly delivering ketorolac to the spinal cord, and again we observed similar changes in the daily latency, percentage of area under the curve and percentage of maximal possible effects among groups infused with morphine, regardless of intrathecal ketorolac treatment. Together, our results demonstrate that recurrent withdrawal is associated with hyperalgesia but this has no effect on the tolerance development; ketorolac protects against recurrent withdrawal induced hyperalgesia without significantly altering spinal morphine tolerance.
Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has often been selected as a therapeutic option for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of repetitive HAIC with high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin given for 3 days in patients with advanced HCC.
Between January 2001 and December 2004, a total of 41 patients with unresectable advanced HCC were enrolled. The patients underwent HAIC via the implantable port system with 5-FU (at a dose of 500 mg/m(2) on Days 1-3) and cisplatin (at a dose of 60 mg/m(2) on Day 2) every 4 weeks. Tumor response was assessed at the end of every 3 cycles.
The median age of the patients was 53 years and 34 patients (82.9%) had evidence of portal vein thrombosis. In total, 230 cycles of HAIC were administered to the 41 patients, with a median of 6 cycles given (range, 1-14 cycles). Nine patients (22.0%) achieved a partial response and 14 patients (34.1%) had stable disease. The median time to disease progression and overall survival were 7.0 months and 12.0 months, respectively. The overall survival was found to be significantly longer in the successful disease control group (patients with a complete response, partial response, and stable disease) than in the disease progression group (median of 14.0 months vs 6.0 months; P < .001). Adverse reactions were tolerable and successfully managed with conservative treatment.
HAIC with high-dose 5-FU and cisplatin given for 3 days achieved effective and safe results in patients with advanced HCC. Therefore, repetitive short-course HAIC with high-dose 5-FU and cisplatin may be useful as an alternative therapeutic option for patients with advanced HCC.
Clostridium difficile-related diarrhea and colitis are common health problems, especially in elderly, frail hospitalized patients. The drug of choice is metronidazole, which can be associated, in long or high doses, with neurotoxic side effects. We report convulsions induced by short-term metronidazole therapy used in conventional doses for Clostridium difficile colitis in an elderly patient with chronic renal failure.
The arrival of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in first line of treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations has changed the strategy of treatment of theses patients. Indeed, response rates in these cases reach around 60 to 70%, with a progression-free survival greatly prolonged, up to 10 months. It seems that these patients with mutated tumor benefit from TKI whatever the treatment line, with the same efficacy. So, the best sequence of treatment (TKI in first line then chemotherapy in second line, or the opposite) needs still to be defined in this sub-group of NSCLC. The choice has to take in account the data of efficacy of TKIs and chemotherapy in the EGFR mutated tumors, with an anticipation of subsequent lines from the first line. Besides, data of toxicity and quality of life have also to be considered.
These studies assessed the neurotoxic potential of N-methyl-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane (para-methoxymethamphetamine; PMMA), an amphetamine analog that has surfaced in the illicit drug market. Repeated subcutaneous injections of PMMA caused lasting, dose-related reductions in regional brain concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and in the density of [3H]paroxetine-labelled 5-HT uptake sites. Comparison of the neurotoxic potential of PMMA to that of para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) and 3,4-methyl-enedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) showed that equivalent doses of PMMA and PMA (80 mg/kg) produced comparable depletions of 5-HT, but that these depletions were not as pronounced as those induced by a lower dose of MDMA (20 mg/kg). Striatal DA was not affected on a long-term basis by any of the ring-substituted amphetamines evaluated in this study. These data suggest that PMMA, like PMA and MDMA, produces long-term (possibly neurotoxic) effects on brain serotonin neurons, but that PMMA is less potent than MDMA as a 5-HT neurotoxin. Further, they raise concern over the illicit use of PMMA since humans could be more sensitive than rodents to the 5-HT neurotoxic effects of PMMA and related drugs.
Since the first reported case in 1912 of cocaine-induced perforation of the palate, an additional 7 cases have been reported describing extensive palatal destruction. The clinical presentation shares similarities with nasal-type natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, Wegener's granulomatosis, and infectious diseases. We describe a 50-year-old woman with a progressively destructive midfacial process that initially appeared as a small, localized palatal defect. Over time, the lesion caused bilateral deformity of the ala, extensive loss of the palate, maxillary and sinonasal complexes, ethmoids, and ulceration of adjacent tissue. Clinical laboratory tests showed elevated cytoplasmic-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, but the histopathology did not support the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. Special stains and cultures were negative for infectious organisms. Flow cytometry and T-cell gene rearrangement studies ruled out lymphoma. Because of the inability to diagnose this worrisome process, the presence of polarizable foreign material in the original biopsy, and the patient's admission to past cocaine use, a urine drug screen was performed, which was positive for cocaine and marijuana.
The aim of this study was to clarify the response of endothelial connexins to hypertension and antihypertensive drugs.
Rats remained normotensive (group 1, N = 10) or were made hypertensive using N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (groups 2 to 4, N = 10/group). Seven weeks later groups 3 and 4 were respectively fed atenolol or carvedilol daily for 7 days and the aortic endothelial gap junctions were analyzed. In parallel the effects of atenolol, carvedilol, labetalol, vitamin C, and vitamin E on connexin43 (Cx43) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were compared.
Endothelial Cx43 was reduced by 35% and Cx37 by 59% in hypertensive rats (P < .001). The reduction was recovered fully by carvedilol but only partially by atenolol (P < .05), although both drugs lowered the blood pressure to similar levels. Cx40 remained stationary in all groups. In HUVEC, carvedilol (10 microg/mL) increased Cx43 protein expression by >70% (P < .01), whereas other drugs had minimal effects. The upregulation by carvedilol was associated with increased transcripts and decreased proteolysis of Cx43.
The study showed that L-NAME-induced hypertension has differential effects on endothelial connexins, which respond variously to carvedilol and atenolol. In HUVEC carvedilol directly upregulates endothelial Cx43 and the effect is independent of its antioxidant activity.
