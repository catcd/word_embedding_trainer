A case of iatrogenic intramedullary contrast injection during a C1-C2 cervical myelography is reported.
To investigate the occurrence of iatrogenic intramedullary contrast injection during a current C1-C2 cervical myelography.
Intramedullary injection of contrast is a rare but serious complication of C1-C2 cervical myelography that has not been reported since the widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging and the NASCIS III study protocol.
A 39-year-old woman received an iatrogenic intramedullary contrast injection during a C1-C2 cervical myelography.
During the procedure the patient reported right-side face, neck, and arm pain and parethesias. After the procedure, right arm weakness and diffuse hyperreflexia developed. Postmyelography imaging demonstrated intramedullary contrast and cord swelling. High-dose methylprednisolone was administered intravenously and the patient's symptoms improved. The literature and management of this rare complication are reviewed.
Intramedullary cord injection is a rare complication of cervical myelography. The mechanism of spinal cord injury appears to involve a combination of physical compression from the injected liquid and neurotoxicity of the contrast material. Iohexol rather than metrizamide should be used when C1-C2 myelography is indicated in patients who are unable to undergo magnetic resonance imaging, or those whose pathology is inadequately demonstrated magnetic resonance imaging alone. In the event of contrast injection into the spinal cord, administration of high-dose methylprednisolone is recommended.
The pesticide DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(chlorodiphenyl)ethane] is 1 of the 12 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under negotiation at the Stockholm Convention to restrict or ban their production and use because of their toxicity, resistance to breakdown, bioaccumulation, and potential for being transported over long distances. DDT has estrogenic potential, and the main metabolite, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), is a potent antiandrogen. In response to mounting evidence on the endocrine-disrupting influence of environmental chemicals on human health, this epidemiological study was initiated to test the hypothesis that nonoccupational exposure to DDT affects male reproductive parameters. In a cross-sectional study, healthy male subjects (n=311) between 18 and 40 years (23+/-5) of age were recruited from 3 communities in an endemic malaria area in which DDT is sprayed annually. A semen analysis according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards was performed. The Hamilton Thorne Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) system was simultaneously used to determine additional sperm motility parameters. Blood plasma samples were assayed for p,p'-DDT and metabolites as a measure of exposure. The exposure levels were expressed as lipid-adjusted p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE values. The mean p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE concentrations were 90.23 microg/g(+/-102.4) and 215.47 microg/g(+/-210.6), respectively. The multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that mean CASA motility was lower with a higher p,p'-DDE concentration (beta=-0.02, P=.001) and the CASA parameter beat cross-frequency (BCF) was higher with a higher p,p'-DDT concentration (beta=0.01, P=.000). There was also a statistically significant positive association between percent sperm with cytoplasmic droplets and p,p'-DDT concentration (beta=0.0014, P=.014). The ejaculate volume (mean 1.9+/-1.33 mL) was lower than the normal range (>or=2.0 mL) according to WHO, and a significant decrease with increasing p,p'-DDE values was seen for both square root-transformed volume (beta=-0.0003; P=.024) and count (beta=-0.003; P=.04). Although there were no associations between either p,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE concentrations and the rest of the seminal parameters, the incidence of teratozoospermia (99%; normal sperm<15%) was high. Twenty-eight percent of the study group presented with oligozoospermia (<20x10(6) sperm/mL), which had a significant positive association with p,p'-DDE (odds ratio [OR]=1.001, P=.03). There was a significant positive association between participants with asthenozoospermia (32%) and p,p'-DDT (OR 1.003, P=.006) and p,p'-DDE (OR 1.001, P=.02). The results imply that nonoccupational exposure to DDT is associated with impaired seminal parameters in men. The high exposure levels of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE are of concern because these levels could have far-reaching implications for reproductive and general health.
The effectiveness of amitriptyline in relieving neuropathic pain following treatment of breast cancer was studied in 15 patients in a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. The dose was escalated from 25 mg to 100 mg per day in 4 weeks. The placebo and amitriptyline phases were separated by a 2-week wash-out period. Visual analogue and verbal rating scales were used for the assessment of pain intensity and pain relief. Other measures included the number of daily activities disturbed by the pain, the Finnish McGill Pain Questionnaire, adverse effects, anxiety, depression, pressure threshold and grip strength. Amitriptyline significantly relieved neuropathic pain both in the arm and around the breast scar. Eight out of 15 patients had a more than 50% decrease in the pain intensity ('good responders') with a median dose of 50 mg of amitriptyline. The 7 patients who had a less than 50% effect had drug concentrations equaling those of the good responders. The 'poor responders' reported significantly more adverse effects with amitriptyline and placebo than the good responders. It is concluded that amitriptyline effectively reduced neuropathic pain following treatment of breast cancer. However, the adverse effects of amitriptyline put most of the patients off from using the drug regularly.
Troglitazone treatment has been associated with idiosyncratic hepatic reaction leading to hepatic failure and death in some patients. This raises questions regarding whether all thiazolidinediones or peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists are hepatotoxic and whether data from clinical trials are adequate to detect a signal of potentially serious drug-related hepatotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the idiosyncratic liver toxicity reported with troglitazone is molecule-specific or a thiazolidinedione class effect, based on liver enzyme data collected prospectively during phase 2/3 clinical trials with rosiglitazone, a new, potent, and specific member of the thiazolidinedione class.
This is an analysis of liver function in type 2 diabetic patients at baseline and serially in 13 double-blind, 2 open-label active-controlled, and 7 open-label extension studies of rosiglitazone treatment conducted in outpatient centers throughout North America and Europe. The study comprised > 6,000 patients aged 30-80 years with type 2 diabetes. Patients underwent baseline liver function studies and were excluded from clinical trials if they had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase value 2.5 times greater than the upper limit of the reference range. The main outcome measures were liver enzyme levels, which were assessed at screening, at baseline, and every 4 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment and at 6- to 12-week intervals thereafter. Patients with at least one on-therapy ALT value >3 times the upper limit of the reference range were identified, and their case records examined in detail.
At baseline, 5.6% of the patients with type 2 diabetes (mean HbA(1c) 8.5-9.0%) had serum ALT values between 1.0 and 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range. On antidiabetic therapy, most of those patients ( approximately 83%) had a decrease in ALT values, many into the normal range. The percentages of all patients with an on-therapy ALT value >3 times the upper limit of the reference range during double-blind and open-label treatment were as follows: rosiglitazone-treated 0.32%, placebo-treated 0.17%, and sulfonylurea-, metformin-, or insulin-treated 0.40%. The respective rates of ALT values >3 times the upper limit of the reference range per 100 person-years of exposure were 0.29, 0.59, and 0.64.
No evidence of hepatotoxic effects was observed in studies that involved 5,006 patients taking rosiglitazone as monotherapy or combination therapy for 5,508 person-years. This is in keeping with hepatic data from clinical trials of another member of the class, pioglitazone, and in contrast to the clear evidence of hepatotoxic effects observed during the troglitazone clinical trial program. These findings suggest that the idiosyncratic liver toxicity observed with troglitazone is unlikely to be a thiazolidinedione or a PPAR-gamma agonist class effect. Poorly controlled patients with type 2 diabetes may have moderate elevations of serum ALT that will decrease with improved glycemic control during treatment with rosiglitazone or other antihyperglycemic agents.
Ten patients (4 female, 6 male) aged 34-67 years suffering from peripheral neuropathic pain participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled study where ketamine or magnesium chloride were administered by a 10 min bolus infusion (ketamine: 0.84 mumol/kg = 0.2 mg/kg, magnesium: 0.16 mmol/kg) followed by a continuous infusion (ketamine: 1.3 mumol/kg/h = 0.3 mg/kg/h, magnesium: 0.16 mmol/kg/h). Ongoing pain determined by VAS score, area of touch-evoked allodynia, detection and pain thresholds to mechanical and thermal stimuli were measured before and during drug infusion. Ketamine produced a significant reduction of spontaneous pain (57%) and of the area of allodynia (33%). Magnesium chloride reduced pain (29%) and area of allodynia (18%) insignificantly. Following ketamine there was a significant correlation between the reduction in ongoing pain and reduction in area of touch-evoked allodynia. Detection and pain thresholds to mechanical and thermal stimuli were not significantly changed by the drugs. These findings suggest that both ongoing pain and touch-evoked pain (allodynia) in neuropathic pain are inter-related phenomena, which may be mediated by the same mechanism and involving a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.
The antipyretic activity of diclofenac sodium, 100 mg suppository was studied retrospectively in 21 applications in seven intensive care patients. Diclofenac sodium proved to be a very potent antipyretic agent with serious side effects. Acute oliguria and protracted circulatory shock occurred after administration, necessitating the administration of increasing amounts of dopamine and i.v. fluids. Possible mechanisms involved are discussed.
The aim was to compare the infarct limiting effect of Ro 40-5967 (Ro40), a new calcium antagonist with little negative inotropic activity, with that of verapamil and with ischaemic preconditioning, a potent endogenous cardioprotective mechanism.
Dogs (n = 53) of either sex were subjected to 60 min of coronary occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Drug treated dogs received either verapamil (1.0 mg.kg-1) or Ro40 (3.0 mg.kg-1) intravenously for 100 min starting 15 min prior to the occlusion. Control dogs received a saline infusion. Ischaemic preconditioning consisted of four 5 min cycles of ischaemia alternating with four 5 min cycles of reperfusion. After 3 h of reflow, hearts were excised and infarct size was measured using tripheyltetrazolium chloride macrochemistry and expressed as percent of the ischaemic area at risk (AAR). To control for variation in infarct size due to variation in collateral blood flow, infarct size among groups was compared using ANCOVA, in which infarct size and collateral blood flow, measured at 30 min of occlusion, were dependent and independent variables, respectively.
Transmural collateral blood flow and AAR were not significantly different between any of the groups. Mean infarct size (adjusted by ANCOVA for slight differences in collateral blood flow among groups) in control dogs (n = 13) was 25.9(SEM 3.2)% of the AAR. Both verapamil (n = 11) and Ro40 (n = 9) limited infarct size [14.2(3.2)% AAR and 16.7(2.9)% AAR, respectively; both p < 0.05]. Preconditioning (n = 17) also significantly limited infarct size [8.1(1.8)%; p < 0.01].
The new calcium antagonist, Ro 40-5967, was as effective as verapamil in limiting infarct size after 60 min of regional ischaemia followed by 3 h of reperfusion, although neither calcium antagonist was as effective as ischaemic preconditioning.
We present a case with angioedema of the tongue, following 1 dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ingestion. A gradual progression of angioedema required tracheotomy despite aggressive medical treatment and illustrates the severity of this adverse reaction. Although ACE inhibitors are considered safe, emergency physicians should be alert for minor angioedema at presentation that may progress to life threatening airway compromise.
We investigate the efficacy and safety of oral paracetamol compared with oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or combination therapy in relieving pain after blunt limb injury in an emergency department (ED).
This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled study in an ED of a university hospital in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Three hundred adult patients with painful isolated limb injuries were enrolled. Primary outcome measures were pain relief at rest and with limb movement, adverse events, and patient satisfaction.
There was no statistical difference in the mean reduction in pain score between any of the combinations at any point, although combination therapy was the first to reach a clinically significant reduction in pain score (<13 mm), and diclofenac-paracetamol combinations consistently produced a greater reduction in mean pain score than either nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or paracetamol alone. All combinations appeared to be safe, although more patients receiving diclofenac-paracetamol combination complained of abdominal pain. The median patient satisfaction scores were poor.
In the doses, frequencies, and routes of administration used for this study, any analgesic benefit of oral paracetamol-nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug combinations over single nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or paracetamol treatment is small and of doubtful clinical significance. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, paracetamol, and diclofenac-paracetamol combinations appeared equally safe in the management of musculoskeletal pain.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States. The administration of certain types of chemotherapy may put breast cancer survivors at risk for late effect drug-induced congestive heart failure (CHF). This case study discusses the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of drug-induced CHF in a woman with breast cancer. Discussions of risk factors and secondary and tertiary prevention of CHF caused by anthracycline chemotherapy agents are also included. Recognition of risk factors and symptoms of CHF is essential to minimize the morbidity and mortality that accompanies cardiac failure and is an important part of the comprehensive care of breast cancer patients. Because drug-induced CHF can occur years after the administration of the offending drug, primary care providers need to be aware of the risk of this disorder among breast cancer survivors under their care.
Three patients with cirrhosis, ascites, and dilutional hyponatremia were treated with demeclocycline in an attempt to correct the abnormal water retention. Demeclocycline administration (600 to 900 mg/day for 8 to 9 days) resulted in [a] increased blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine concentrations; [b] reduction of the inulin clearance by between 63% to 78% and of paraaminophippurate clearance by 36% to 77%; and [c] an impairment of the renal concentrating ability. Urine osmolality decreased to hypotonic levels, but polyuria did not appear, probably because it was prevented by the reduction of the glomerular filtration rate. Renal failure was reversible on withdrawal of demeclocycline. No other causes than demeclocycline administration could be found to explain the reduction of the glomerular filtration rate and the estimated renal plasma flow.
A HIV-1 patient database was scanned in March 1998, and 750 patients were identified who had received HAART including indinavir. Of these, 28 cases had nephrolithiasis; and 85 asymptomatic indinavir-treated patients were randomly selected as controls. The characteristics of cases and controls were compared by analysis of variance for quantitative parameters and by Fisher's exact test for classes.
We observed a significant increase in the incidence of nephrolithiasis in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and either hepatitis C virus (HCV) (HCV RNA-positive) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) (HBs antigen-positive) (odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals: 2.8 and 1.1-7.7), whereas no significant differences were demonstrated between cases and controls with regard to age (42.4 +/- 8.0 versus 39.8 +/- 9.8 years), sex (male patients 70.4 versus 74.1%), duration of HIV-1 infection (8.6 +/- 3.1 versus 7.7 +/- 4.0 years), duration of indinavir treatment (16.1 +/- 5.8 versus 14.1 +/- 5.4 months), AST increase > or = 1.25 of normal (29.6 versus 25.9%), or ALT increase > or = 1.25 of normal (33.3 versus 22.4%). In co-infected patients, ALT increase (> or = 1.25 of normal), but not AST increase, at the time of indinavir initiation was statistically related to the occurrence of nephrolithiasis.
We found a significant increase of nephrolithiasis incidence in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HCV or HBV, which suggests that underlying multifactorial hepatic damage may limit liver catabolism of indinavir, and consequently increase its renal excretion and the risk of nephrolithiasis. Caution is therefore advised when initiating indinavir treatment in HIV patients with evidence of HBV or HCV infection.
We have previously reported that cimetidine, a reference H2 receptor antagonist, attenuates the initial osteoclastic burst and subsequent trabecular bone loss induced by ovariectomy (ovx) in rats. This study was designed to determine whether these effects are specific to H2 antagonism. To this end, we compared the effects of two H2 receptor antagonists, cimetidine and famotidine. In addition, we analyzed the response of histamine-producing cells to these inhibitors. Seventy-two 90-day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized or sham-operated, and received single daily intramuscular injections of cimetidine (125 mg/kg), famotidine (10 mg/kg), or vehicle. The animals were killed 14 days after surgery and their femurs were processed for histomorphometry. Trabecular bone volume was reduced by 30% in ovx rats and by 15% in cimetidine- and famotidine-treated rats. Architectural parameters were reduced by about 20% in ovx rats. Cimetidine and famotidine attenuated these consequences of ovx by about 50%. Trabecular connectivity was deteriorated by ovx, while cimetidine and famotidine attenuated this effect. Resorption parameters were increased by ovx, while cimetidine and famotidine prevented this increase. Kinetic bone formation parameters were increased by ovx, while cimetidine and famotidine had no influence. Neither cimetidine nor famotidine had any observable effect in sham-treated rats. Mast cell numbers increased by 250% in ovx rats and by only 40% in H2 antagonists-treated ovx rats. A resident histamine-positive, non-mast cell, population found in bone marrow was increased by 25% by ovx. Interestingly, cimetidine and famotidine reduced this population in both sham-operated and ovx rats, famotidine being more potent than cimetidine. These results show that H(2) receptor blockade partially prevents the consequences of castration on cancellous bone resorption in female rats, and strongly suggest that histamine participates in the mediator network regulating estrogen deficiency induced bone resorption. A large population of histamine-producing cells, which differ morphologically from mast cells and belong to an immature marrow population, may be a source of histamine in this model. The H(2) blockers targeted this population, and this effect appeared to explain the anti-resorptive action of the two drugs.
An elderly patient with congestive heart failure developed serious hyperkalaemia and reversible nonoliguric renal failure during combined therapy with captopril, furosemide (frusemide) and potassium supplements. This case illustrates that such complications can occur late during the course of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It is therefore important that both the renal function and plasma potassium are closely monitored in such patients even if these parameters are normal at the beginning of therapy.
Nicotine's neurotoxic properties in rats were investigated by administering (-)-nicotine tartrate for 5 days either continuously in doses of 5.01, 5.72, 6.44, 7.13, 20.41 and 43.1 mg/kg/day via osmotic minipump or intermittently at 11.32 mg/kg/day via one daily subcutaneous injection. As assessed by silver staining, neurotoxicity was seen almost exclusively in the axons of the medial habenula and its output tract, the fasciculus retroflexus, in all treatment groups except the lowest dose. Within the habenula, the damage was noted in the ventral-medial-most portion of the nucleus which is thought to be dense with the alpha 4 beta 2 and/or alpha 3 beta 4 receptor subtypes. Past research has shown the medial habenula to be highly sensitive to the effects of nicotine, and these findings, in conjunction with related research using dopaminergic stimulants, indicate that the habenula may be a weak link in the neurotoxicity seen following stimulant drugs of abuse.
Human myxoid liposarcomas contain a characteristic chromosomal translocation, t(12;16)(q13;p11), that is associated with a structural rearrangement of the gene encoding CHOP, a growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors residing on 12q13.1. Using a CHOP-specific complementary probe and antiserum we report here the presence of an abnormal CHOP transcript and protein in these tumours. Cloning of the translocation-associated CHOP gene product revealed a fusion between CHOP and a gene provisionally named TLS (translocated in liposarcoma). TLS is a novel nuclear RNA-binding protein with extensive sequence similarity to EWS, the product of a gene commonly translocated in Ewing's sarcoma. In TLS-CHOP the RNA-binding domain of TLS is replaced by the DNA-binding and leucine zipper dimerization domain of CHOP. Targeting of a conserved effector domain of RNA-binding proteins to DNA may play a role in tumour formation.
A 34-year-old white male was executing blasting works in an operation of a quarry several times a month during a period of 1 year. Each time he worked with explosives, he complained of headache, vertigo and concentration failure which started shortly after beginning and continued several hours after. The results of the physical examination on a day without blasting works were normal. Because of the exact working parallel appearance of the symptoms we did further explorations at the workplace which showed the usage of nitroglycerin blasting agents without observance of the safety regulations. The symptoms only at blasting workdays with normal clinical findings at break led considering the relation with the occupational conditions to the diagnosis "headache due to exposure to nitroglycerin explosives". It was reported to the employer's liability insurance association as an occupational disease with the aim of improving occupational conditions.
Occupational toxic agents as a potential trigger of unclear headache support the requirement of an exact anamnesis of working conditions and environment.
Angioedema is a known adverse reaction of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Although current investigations are in progress, the exact pathogenesis of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is still unclear. Most cases of angioedema we have seen remitting from the short-acting ACE inhibitor, captopril, have presented with mild angioedema, controlled with antihistamines and glucocorticosteroids. In contrast, the angioedema induced by the long-acting ACE inhibitors have been serious. Our five patients developed angioedema from either lisinopril or enalapril. Three of five patients presented with severe angioedema requiring intubation, and one of these patients had a tracheostomy. One patient with a history of mild angioedema secondary to captopril subsequently required intubation for his enalapril-induced angioedema.
The optimal method of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism after total hip replacement (THR) remains uncertain. Most surgeons use some form of pharmacological prophylaxis, most commonly heparin. The precise balance of the benefits and risks is unclear, and serious complications can occur. We describe a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome in a 62-year-old woman after THR.
Visceral leishmaniasis is a widespread and deadly disease. First-line drugs are antimonials, but amphotericin B and its lipid formulations B is used for treating visceral leishmaniasis that is unresponsive to antimony. New therapeutic approaches are being actively developed, including the following: use of drug carriers targeted specifically to the parasite location, thus reduce adverse effects of drug; use of immunomodulating drugs; evaluation of natural products; pharmacokinetic studies; and drug combinations. Recent clinical trials with paromomycin and miltefosine were successful and these drugs appear to be promising for the future therapy of visceral leishmaniasis. Furthermore, identification and therapeutic evaluation of specific targets in the Leishmania organism could lead to new compounds, such as antileishmanial drugs and reversal agents of drug resistance.
To evaluate the mutation prevalence and phenotype in genes involved in the ocular retinoid metabolism.
We analyzed LRAT, encoding the lecithin retinol acyltransferase, and RDH10, a retinal pigment epithelium-specific retinol dehydrogenase.
We screened by denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC) and direct sequencing all coding exons of LRAT and RDH10 in 216 patients, including 134 with simplex or multiplex retinitis pigmentosa and 82 with various types of flecked retinal dystrophies.
Only nonpathogenic variants were found in this series. In an additional 2.5-year-old patient presenting with an "RPE65" phenotype (night blindness, photoattractivity, and visual improvement several months after birth), we discovered a homozygous deletion in LRAT (c.217_218delAT) leading to a premature stop at codon 120.
The phenotype of patients with mutations in LRAT is similar to that of patients with mutations in RPE65, suggesting the need to systematically screen both genes in case of typical phenotype.
Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element and it is abundant in connective tissues, however biological roles of Zn and its transporters in those tissues and cells remain unknown.
Here we report that mice deficient in Zn transporter Slc39a13/Zip13 show changes in bone, teeth and connective tissue reminiscent of the clinical spectrum of human Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The Slc39a13 knockout (Slc39a13-KO) mice show defects in the maturation of osteoblasts, chondrocytes, odontoblasts, and fibroblasts. In the corresponding tissues and cells, impairment in bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and TGF-beta signaling were observed. Homozygosity for a SLC39A13 loss of function mutation was detected in sibs affected by a unique variant of EDS that recapitulates the phenotype observed in Slc39a13-KO mice.
Hence, our results reveal a crucial role of SLC39A13/ZIP13 in connective tissue development at least in part due to its involvement in the BMP/TGF-beta signaling pathways. The Slc39a13-KO mouse represents a novel animal model linking zinc metabolism, BMP/TGF-beta signaling and connective tissue dysfunction.
