Treatment with 1-4 microM As(2)O(3) slightly induced apoptosis in U-937 human promonocitic leukemia cells. This effect was potentiated by co-treatment with MEK/ERK (PD98059, U0126) and JNK (SP600125, AS601245) inhibitors, but not with p38 (SB203580, SB220025) inhibitors. However, no potentiation was obtained using lonidamine, doxorubicin, or cisplatin instead of As(2)O(3). Apoptosis potentiation by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors involved both the intrinsic and extrinsic executionary pathways, as demonstrated by Bax activation and cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and by caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage, respectively; and the activation of both pathways was prevented by Bcl-2 over-expression. Treatment with MEK/ERK and JNK inhibitors, but not with p38 inhibitors, caused intracellular glutathione (GSH) depletion, which was differentially regulated. Thus, while it was prevented by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in the case of U0126, it behaved as a NAC-insensitive process, regulated at the level of DL-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO)-sensitive enzyme activity, in the case of SP600125. The MEK/ERK inhibitor also potentiated apoptosis and decreased GSH content in As(2)O(3)-treated NB4 human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, but none of these effects were produced by the JNK inhibitor. MEK/ERK and JNK inhibitors did not apparently affect As(2)O(3) transport activity, as measured by intracellular arsenic accumulation. SP600126 greatly induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, while BSO and U0126 had little or null effects. These results, which indicate that glutathione is a target of MAP kinases in myeloid leukemia cells, might be exploited to improve the antitumor properties of As(2)O(3), and provide a rationale for the use of kinase inhibitors as therapeutic agents.
Clinical and experimental findings had indicated that cigarette smoke exposure, and cyclooxygenase-2, are strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of cyclooxygenase-2 in the pathogenesis of experimental inflammatory bowel disease as well as in the adverse action of cigarette-smoke exposure. Rats were pretreated with different cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (indomethacin, nimesulide, or SC-236 (4-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide)) along with cigarette-smoke exposure before 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-enema. Results indicated that pretreatment with cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors not only protected against 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced inflammatory bowel disease, but also attenuated the potentiating effect of cigarette-smoke exposure on colonic damage. Furthermore, the colonic cyclooxygenase-2 protein and mRNA expression was markedly induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-enema, and it was potentiated further by cigarette-smoke exposure, while the cyclooxygenase-1 expression was not changed. The present study suggests that the highly induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression not only plays a pathogenic role in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced inflammatory bowel disease, but also contributes to the adverse action of cigarette-smoke exposure on this disorder.
Skeletal myoblast transplantation is promising for the treatment of end-stage heart failure. Direct intramyocardial injection is useful for local cell delivery but may not be effective in global dissemination of cells into the heart, which would be advantageous in treating generalized cardiac dysfunction as in dilated cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that intracoronary infusion of myoblasts would disseminate cells more effectively, leading to functional improvement in global heart failure.
Heart failure was induced by the intraperitoneal administration of doxorubicin (total dose 15 mg/kg) in rat. One million primary skeletal myoblasts were then infused via the coronary arteries of an excised, failing doxorubicin-treated heart. After incubation under increased intracoronary pressure, the hearts were subsequently transplanted into syngeneic recipients. For the control group, doxorubicin-treated hearts were infused with medium only and transplanted. Four weeks after transplantation, Langendorff perfusion demonstrated that both maximum dP/dt (2797.6+/-103.3 versus 2326.9+/-133.1 mm Hg/s, P=0.01) and minimum dP/dt (-2067.4+/-88.1 versus -1718.8+/-91.3 mm Hg/s, P=0.02) were improved in myoblast-transplanted hearts compared with medium-infused hearts. This was associated with a sharper slope of the left ventricular developed pressure-volume curve and a reduced slope of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relation in the myoblast-transplanted hearts. Immunohistochemistry for skeletal myosin heavy chain showed that globally disseminated myoblasts had survived and differentiated into multinucleated myotubes that had aligned with the cardiac fiber axis within host myocardium. No significant myocardial infarction was observed.
We demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of skeletal myoblast transplantation via the intracoronary route as a promising strategy for improving cardiac function in global heart failure.
Short-term lamivudine and its withdrawal were evaluated as regards an immunomodulatory therapy of chronic hepatitis B. Lamivudine was given for 3 or 6 months to 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype C, including 15 with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and 8 without it. It decreased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and HBV DNA in HBeAg-positive patients. Flare-ups of ALT and HBV DNA after treatment were observed in most patients, and 4 of the 12 (33%) patients with 6-month lamivudine treatment remained in remission 6 months after withdrawal of the therapy. In HBeAg-negative patients, however, flare-ups of ALT and HBV DNA were mild. Normalization of ALT and a decrease in serum HBV DNA were accomplished in 6 of the 9 (75%) patients. Breakthroughs or serious side effects were not observed in any patients. Short-term lamivudine is safe and may offer a therapeutic option to patients with chronic hepatitis B.
To investigate the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in blood pressure regulation, we used rats with hypertension, induced by the chronic infusion of norepinephrine or angiotensin II, and examined changes in the systemic hemodynamics using the radioactive microspheres method. CGRP (0.05 micrograms/kg per min) administered simultaneously with norepinephrine (1.8 mg/kg per day) significantly reduced the systolic blood pressure of conscious rats compared with norepinephrine infusion alone. Similarly CGRP given with angiotensin II (0.9 mg/kg per day) significantly reduced the systolic blood pressure compared with angiotensin II alone. The antihypertensive effect of CGRP was sustained for 6 days. CGRP infusion decreased the total peripheral resistance but caused no change in cardiac output compared with rats given only pressor substances. Thus, a subdepressor dose of CGRP can modulate the vasopressor effects of norepinephrine and angiotensin II. CGRP may be involved in the regulation of blood pressure via an effect on peripheral vascular resistance.
Here we report the discovery of recurrent mutations concentrated at an ultraviolet signature hotspot in KNSTRN, which encodes a kinetochore protein, in 19% of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Cancer-associated KNSTRN mutations, most notably those encoding p.Ser24Phe, disrupt chromatid cohesion in normal cells, occur in SCC precursors, correlate with increased aneuploidy in primary tumors and enhance tumorigenesis in vivo. These findings suggest a role for KNSTRN mutagenesis in SCC development.
1. Fenofibrate and xuezhikang are two types of drugs widely used in the treatment of dyslipidaemia in China. The main purpose of present study was to test the efficacies and explore the potential mechanisms of action of the two lipid-lowering agents on high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 2. Rats were randomly divided into four groups, with eight rats per group. One group was given normal diet, whereas the other three groups were fed a high-fat diet. Forty-two days later, two of the high-fat diet-fed groups were administered fenofibrate (100 mg/kg, p.o.) and xuezhikang (300 mg/kg, p.o.) for another 42 consecutive days. The other two groups were administered placebo (saline) by gavage. 3. Typical pathological symptoms of NAFLD occurred in the high-fat diet groups. Fenofibrate and xuezhikang treatment markedly improved NAFLD, ameliorating dyslipidaemia and fat accumulation in the liver, improving insulin resistance and ameliorating oxidative stress. Hepatic steatosis, necro-inflammation and collagen deposition were lessened in the drug-treated groups. However, both xuezhikang and fenofibrate failed to reverse hepatomegaly and fenofibrate even aggravated it. Xuezhikang reversed aminotransferase abnormalities, but fenofibrate had less of an effect. 4. The common therapeutic mechanism of action of fenofibate and xuezhikang likely involves inhibition of the hepatic expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Fenofibrate upregulated mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha in the liver, whereas xuezhikang had no effect on the hepatic expression of PPARalpha and this may explain, in part, their different effects on the NAFLD rats. 5. The results suggest that fenofibrate and xuezhikang may have potential clinical application in the treatment of NAFLD. However, the side-effects of fenofibrate and the underlying constituents of xuezhikang need to be determined and investigated further.
Seizures remain among the most serious side effects of psychotropic drugs. The authors review the literature associating neuroleptic and antidepressant medications with seizures, discussing the relative "seizurogenicity" of different medications, risk factors for seizures, and drugs of choice for high-risk patients. Case histories are presented. Available evidence suggests that molindone, fluphenazine, and haloperidol are among the least seizurogenic neuroleptics and that doxepin, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or electroconvulsive therapy may be safest in treating the depressed patient at risk for seizures.
Two different mutations of the active-site Lys-296 in rhodopsin, K296E and K296M, have been found to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP). In vitro studies have shown that both mutations result in constitutive activation of the protein, suggesting that the activated state of the receptor may be responsible for retinal degeneration in patients with these mutations. Previous work has highlighted the potential of retinylamine analogs as active-site directed inactivators of constitutively active mutants of rhodopsin with the idea that these or related compounds might be used therapeutically for cases of ADRP involving mutations of the active-site Lys. Unfortunately, however, amine derivatives of 11-cis-retinal, although highly effective against a K296G mutant of rhodopsin, were without affect on the two naturally occurring ADRP mutants, presumably because of the greater steric bulk of Glu and Met side chains in comparison to Gly. For this reason we synthesized a retinylamine analog one carbon shorter than the parent 11-cis-retinal and show that this compound is indeed an effective inhibitor of both the K296E and K296M mutants. The 11-cis C19 retinylamine analog 1 inhibits constitutive activation of transducin by these mutants and their constitutive phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase, and it does so in the presence of continuous illumination from room lights.
Cocaine abuse and HIV disease each have potentially adverse effects upon the heart and cardiovascular system which may be exacerbated when these risk factors are combined. The development of a safe and effective agent to treat both cocaine addiction and its cardiovascular sequelae, that is well-tolerated by HIV patients, would thus be of considerable clinical utility. In this article we discuss the rationale for the investigation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, commonly used to treat hypertension, for treatment in cocaine-abusing populations, based on their potential to reduce cocaine use by modulating levels of dopamine and corticotropin releasing factor in the brain, and on their ability to reverse cardiovascular and platelet abnormalities. We present preliminary findings from echocardiographic and platelet activation studies in 16 HIV-positive, cocaine abusing patients, as well as tolerability and efficacy studies of the ACE-inhibitor, fosinopril, for the treatment of cocaine abuse in both HIV-positive (n=6) and HIV-negative (n=5) methadone-maintained cocaine abusers. Findings suggest that HIV-positive cocaine-abusing patients possess abnormalities of diastolic heart function and platelet activation that are potentially reversible with ACE-inhibitor therapy. Findings also suggest that fosinopril is well-tolerated regardless of HIV serostatus, does not appear to cause hypotension, and may possess effectiveness for reducing cocaine use. We conclude that ACE-inhibitor therapy may offer a new pharmacologic approach to the treatment of cocaine abuse and its complications, and that controlled research of this class of agents may be promising.
Formaldehyde is a low molecular weight chemical and can elicit acute and chronic health related problems. Most of the inhaled formaldehyde is retained in the upper respiratory tract due to its extraordinary solubility. Therefore, cases of formaldehyde-induced occupational asthma are sporadic despite its widespread use in industrial processes. We herein report upon a case of occupational asthma due to formaldehyde, which was confirmed by workplace challenge including working environmental assessments, and by formaldehyde inhalation challenge using a specially designed closed-circuit apparatus. To investigate the possible involvement of an IgE-mediated mechanism, both in vitro and in vivo tests were done. IgE antibody specific for formaldehyde-human serum albumin conjugate (F-HSA) was not detected by ELISA, and no specific cutaneous reactivity to F-HSA was noted by either skin prick or intradermal test. The patient was diagnosed with formaldehyde-induced occupational asthma not associated with an IgE mediated mechanism.
At constant pressure work there was an increase in the oxygen consumption of the dog heartlung preparation after tachycardia due to auricular stimulation and a far greater increase in consumption after ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia, as compared with control hearts beating at their own sinus rhythm. In neither condition was the increase in coronary flow greater than the spontaneous increase in the controls. It is suggested that an increase in oxygen demand, under certain circumstances, may be met primarily by an increased desaturation of coronary blood. "Therapeutic" doses of ouabain did not improve the mechanical efficiency of the preparation. "Toxic" doses of ouabain which gave rise to ventricular tachycardia did not decrease the phosphocreatine or labile nucleotide phosphorus content of the heart provided there was no hypoxia of the heart muscle.
Long-term arsenic exposure is associated with an increased risk of vascular diseases including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and carotid atherosclerosis. The pathogenic mechanisms of arsenic atherogenicity are not completely clear. A fundamental role for inflammation in atherosclerosis and its complications has become appreciated recently. To investigate molecular targets of inflammatory pathway possibly involved in arsenic-associated atherosclerosis, we conducted an exploratory study using cDNA microarray and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to identify genes with differential expression in arsenic-exposed yet apparently healthy individuals. As an initial experiment, array hybridization was performed with mRNA isolated from activated lymphocytes of 24 study subjects with low (0-4.32 microg/L), intermediate (4.64-9.00 microg/L), and high (9.60-46.5 microg/L) levels of blood arsenic, with each group comprising eight age-, sex-, and smoking frequency-matched individuals. A total of 708 transcripts of known human genes were analyzed, and 62 transcripts (8.8%) showed significant differences in the intermediate or high-arsenic groups compared with the low-level arsenic group. Among the significantly altered genes, several cytokines and growth factors involving inflammation, including interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, chemokine C-C motif ligand 2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2/MCP1), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 1/growth-related oncogene alpha, chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 2/growth-related oncogene beta, CD14 antigen, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (interstitial collagenase) were upregulated in persons with increased arsenic exposure. Multivariate analyses on 64 study subjects of varying arsenic exposure levels showed that the association of CCL2/MCP1 plasma protein level with blood arsenic remained significant after adjustment for other risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. The results of this gene expression study indicate that the expression of inflammatory molecules may be increased in human subjects after prolonged exposure to arsenic, which might be a contributory factor to the high risk of atherosclerosis in arseniasis-endemic areas in Taiwan. Further multidisciplinary studies, including molecular epidemiologic investigations, are needed to elucidate the role of arsenic-associated inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease.
We report an episode of severe bradycardia that occurred in a 49-year-old woman with fever and malignant jaundice during antibiotic therapy with linezolid, a new oxazolidinone with activity against Gram-positive cocci. In our case, the strict temporal dependence between bradycardia and linezolid therapy seems to provide strong evidence for a causal relationship. To our knowledge, this is the first report of linezolid-induced bradycardia. This adverse event confirms that the new antibiotic linezolid should be administered with caution in patient with jaundice and hepatic insufficiency.
Astragalus membranaceus (AM) has been widely used for treating liver diseases in traditional Chinese medicine. Experimental evidence indicates that it has antitumor potential. In this study, the effect of AM on hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN), two-thirds partial hepatectomy, and 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) (DEN-PH-AAF) was evaluated using glutathione S-transferase placenta form (GST-P) as marker. First, rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with DEN (200 mg/kg in saline), a two-thirds partial hepatectomy was carried out 2 weeks later, and the rats were then placed on a basal diet containing 0.02% AAF from week 3 to week 8 to induce hepatocarcinogenesis. The rats were given AM (90 mg/kg or 180 mg/kg body weight) by gavage from week 3 to week 8 (treatment groups). The formation of GST-P-positive foci and the expression of GST-P protein and mRNA caused by DEN-PH-AAF were reduced in the treatment groups, which clearly suggests that AM is effective in delaying DEN-PH-AAF-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
Antagonism of neuromuscular block using cholinesterase inhibitors and atropine is charged with several risks, which are at least partly caused by pharmacological characteristics of the anticholinergic drugs, e.g. short duration of action causing secondary bradycardia. Compared to atropine, ipratropium bromide, a new anticholinergic drug, is--due to its quarternary ammonium compound--characterized by longer duration of action. In contrast to atropine, this substance does not penetrate the blood-brain and placental barrier. Our present study was designed to compare the haemodynamic effects of both substances, using invasive monitoring, during antagonism of neuromuscular block with pyridostigmine. In contrast to atropine, ipratropium bromide induced a higher degree of initial tachycardia but did not allow secondary reduction of heart rate by rebound vagal stimulation. While cardiac output was almost constant, ipratropium bromide caused changes in stroke volume, which were due to alterations in heart rate. There were no clinically relevant changes of the other haemodynamic parameters. Cardiac arrhythmia were observed more often after administration of atropine and were of longer duration. In conclusion, ipratropium bromide is a useful alternative to atropine in patients with pre existing low heart rate and bradyarrhythmia.
A patient with myeloma nephropathy and acute, probably diclofenac-induced renal failure developed a neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) during treatment with metoclopramide and neuroleptics. These drugs were withdrawn, symptomatic treatment of NMS was started and the patient was hemodialyzed because of uremia. During hemodialysis, the patient's condition improved dramatically and NMS did not recur during her further stay in the hospital. The temporal relationship between metoclopramide administration and the development of NMS, as well as the rapid reversal of NMS, suggest that NMS in this patient was caused by metoclopramide and not by neuroleptic drugs. Thus, metoclopramide should be used with caution in patients with renal failure and patients should be monitored closely for the development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Hemodialysis may be therapeutically effective in certain patients with metoclopramide-induced NMS.
The relationship between free radical and scavenger enzymes has been found in the epilepsy and reactive oxygen species have been implicated in seizure-induced neurodegeneration. It has been suggested that pilocarpine-induced seizures is mediated by increases in oxidative stress. Current researches have suggested that antioxidant compounds may afford some level of neuroprotection against the neurotoxicity of seizures in cellular level. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of lipoic acid (LA) in rats, against the observed oxidative stress during seizures induced by pilocarpine. Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group), LA (20mg/kg, i.p., LA group), pilocarpine (400mg/kg, i.p., P400 group), and the association of LA (20mg/kg, i.p.) plus pilocarpine (400mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before of administration of LA (LA plus P400 group). After the treatments all groups were observed for 1h. The enzyme activities as well as the lipid peroxidation and nitrite concentrations were measured using spectrophotometric methods and the results compared to values obtained from saline and pilocarpine-treated animals. Protective effects of LA were also evaluated on the same parameters. In P400 group there was a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, nitrite level and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. However, no alteration was observed in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. Antioxidant treatment significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation level and nitrite content as well as increased the SOD, catalase and GPx activities in rat striatum after seizures. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that oxidative stress in striatum occurs during seizures induced by pilocarpine, proving that brain damage induced by the oxidative process plays a crucial role in seizures pathogenic consequences, and also imply that strong protective effect could be achieved using LA.
Recently a new class of "designer drugs" has emerged on the drugs abuse market, known as "legal highs". Such drugs are legal to use and possess, and legal to supply. Mephedrone, a central nervous system stimulant, is the most widely experienced "legal high". This review presents any available information about psychoactive properties, safety profile, clinical data, and legislation of the new "legal high" and emphasizes the role of Internet with mephedrone's expansion. Available data were collected by various literature search engines and World Wide Web. All valuable information about psychoactive properties, safety profile and clinical data for mephedrone and its use as "legal high" were managed to spot and summarise. Internet plays a significant role for the distribution of "legal highs", becoming one of the major "drug market". Adolescents and young adults who are curious about drugs may search on the Internet and thereby become exposed to thousands of sites that expound upon the positive effects of drugs and downplay or deny any negative effects. Use of mephedrone is mainly a youth phenomenon. The hazardous side-effects are strong desire to re-dose, uncomfortable changes in body temperature and heart rate, hallucinations and psychosis.
Previous studies have shown that the susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in female rats changes according to estrous cycle phases. These studies have also shown that following pilocarpine administration changes occur in gonadal, hypophyseal and hypothalamic hormones that could contribute for the sequence of the epileptic events. Accordingly, the present work aimed to investigate the role of sexual hormones withdrawal on the development of the pilocarpine model of epilepsy in female rats. With this purpose, castrated and non-castrated adult female Wistar rats were injected with pilocarpine and some characteristic parameters of the experimental model were observed. The results showed increased mortality after pilocarpine injection in the castrated rats when compared with non-castrated females. The latency period for SE onset and for the first spontaneous seizure was decreased in castrated when compared with non-castrated animals. The mossy fiber sprouting measured by neo-Timm scale during the chronic period, reached grade 3 for castrated epileptic rats while the non-castrated epileptic rats showed grade 2. Our results indicate that castration interferes with the epileptogenesis in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy suggesting that female sexual hormones could have protective effects against pilocarpine-induced SE.
We report a case of fulminant hepatic necrosis occurring in the setting of acetaminophen overdose and chronic alcohol use. The pathology of severe acute toxicity is documented with a surgical biopsy. Follow-up liver biopsy 4 yr later documents hepatic regeneration without cirrhosis. Maintenance of the hepatic reticulin framework in the face of acute hepatic necrosis was well documented, and may be a useful prognostic feature indicating a potential for the maintenance of normal hepatic architecture following regeneration.
Past work suggests that tubulin from kinetoplastid parasites may present an excellent drug target. To explore this possibility, tubulin was purified on a milligram scale from Leishmania mexicana amazonensis promastigotes by sonication, DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, and one cycle of assembly-disassembly. Purified leishmanial tubulin is recognized by commercially available anti-tubulin antibodies and displays concentration dependent assembly in vitro. The vinca site agents vinblastine, maytansine, and rhizoxin bind to leishmanial tubulin as assessed by the quenching of intrinsic tubulin fluorescence and the alteration of the proteins reactivity with the sulfhydryl-specific reagent 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). They also interfere with the assembly of leishmanial tubulin at low micromolar concentrations. Electrophilic compounds such as phenyl arsenoxide and 4-chloro-3,5-dinitro-alpha,alpha,alpha-trifluorotoluene (chloralin), which are of interest as traditional and experimental antiparasitic agents, respectively, inhibit the assembly of leishmanial tubulin in vitro as well. Colchicine-site agents and trifluralin, on the other hand, have little or no effect on leishmanial tubulin in these assays. Maytansine, taxol, and the electrophiles block the growth of Leishmania donovani amastigote-like forms in vitro at low ( <1 microM) concentrations, while colchicine site agents, trifluralin, vinblastine, and rhizoxin are at least two orders of magnitude less toxic to the parasite.
Changes in the brain's cholinergic receptor systems underlie several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. An emerging preclinical literature also reveals that acetylcoholine may have an important function in addictive processes, including reward, learning, and memory. This study was designed to assess alterations in cholinergic receptor systems in limbic regions of abstinent cocaine-addicted subjects compared with healthy controls. On three separate days, 23 1- to 6-week abstinent, cocaine- (and mostly nicotine-) addicted subjects and 22 sex-, age-, and race-matched control subjects were administered the muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic agonist physostigmine, the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, and saline. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after each infusion was determined using single photon emission-computed tomography. Both cholinergic probes induced rCBF changes (p<0.005) in relatively distinct, cholinergic-rich, limbic brain regions. After physostigmine, cocaine-addicted subjects showed altered rCBF, relative to controls, in limbic regions, including the left hippocampus, left amygdala, and right insula. Group differences in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and middle temporal gyrus were also evident. Scopolamine also revealed group differences in the left hippocampus and right insula as well as the posterior cingulate and middle temporal gyrus. Cocaine addicted and controls differ in their subcortical, limbic, and cortical response to cholinergic probes in areas relevant to craving, learning, and memory. Cholinergic systems may offer a pharmacologic target for cocaine addiction treatment.
The aim of the present paper is to determine the effect of Paracetamol (P) acute intoxication in cholestatic rats. Four groups of animals were considered: controls, controls intoxicated with P, rats intoxicated with P and cholestatic rats. Hepatic biochemical tests and liver histology were performed in every group. It is concluded that cholestatic rats intoxicated with P showed less Liver damage than in control groups.
By screening patients with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) for mutations within the V(2) vasopressin receptor (AVPR2) gene, we have identified six novel and two recurrent mutations. Additionally, one patient revealed a genomic deletion of 3.2 kb encompassing most of the AVPR2 gene and the last exon/3'-region of C1 gene, which is in close proximity to the AVPR2 locus. In-depth characterization of the mutant AVPR2s by a combination of functional and immunological techniques allowed to gain further insight into molecular mechanisms leading to the receptor dysfunction. Aiming at the functional reconstitution of mutant G protein-coupled receptors, several strategies of potential therapeutic usefulness have been tested. Because the functional rescue of truncated receptors is most challenging, we addressed this issue by applying an aminoglycoside approach. Here, we demonstrate that the misreading capacity of the aminoglycoside antibiotic geneticin was sufficient to restore function of mutant AVPR2s harboring premature stop codons in an in vitro expression system.
Nerve growth factor (NGF) activates multiple downstream effectors, including Ras, phosphoinositide-3 kinase, and sphingomyelins. However, pathway mediating the NGF-induced augmentation of sensory neuronal excitability remains largely unknown. We previously reported that small-diameter sensory neurons with a heterozygous mutation of the Nf1 gene (Nf1+/-) exhibited increased excitability. The protein product of the Nf1 gene is neurofibromin, a guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP) for p21ras (Ras) that accelerates the conversion of active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP. Thus, Nf1+/- cells have augmented basal and stimulated Ras activity. To investigate whether NGF-induced increases in excitability of small-diameter sensory neurons are dependent on Ras signaling, an antibody that blocks the activation of Ras, Y13-259, was perfused into the cell. Under these conditions, the enhanced excitability produced by NGF was suppressed in wildtype neurons but the excitability of Nf1+/- neurons was unaltered. In addition, expression of a dominant-negative form of Ras abolished the ability of NGF to increase the excitability of small-diameter sensory neurons. These results demonstrate that NGF enhances excitability of small-diameter sensory neurons in a Ras-dependent manner while the consequences of decreased expression of neurofibromin cannot be restored by blocking Ras signaling; suggesting that Ras-initiated signaling pathways can regulate both transcriptional and posttranslational control of ion channels important in neuronal excitability.
Acute renal failure induced by methotrexate (MTX) can be lethal because renal excretion of the drug can be delayed. Pre-existing renal impairment, abstention, or underdosage of folinic acid and inadequate hydration facilitate toxicity. The prolonged high serum levels of MTX result in severe mucositis and pancytopenia, but strategies useful to accelerate MTX removal have not been universally accepted. We report a case of a 13-year-old girl with osteosarcoma who was treated with high-dose MTX because of thoracic tumor recurrence. No side effects were observed after 2 cycles of high-dose MTX; however, after the third cycle there was a delayed MTX elimination followed by clinical toxicity. Forty hours post-MTX infusion the serum level of MTX was 5.39 x 10(-4) mol/L. Treatment was based on symptomatic measures, such as maintenance of an abundant and alkaline diuresis and parenteral administration of folinic acid. Concomitantly, plasma exchange was employed to accelerate MTX removal and reduce its toxicity. After 24 days, she was discharged from the hospital, and her renal function recovered gradually.
