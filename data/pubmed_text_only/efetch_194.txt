Previous studies have shown that conjugated estrogens and continuous medroxyprogesterone increases heart disease risk in healthy women. Little is known about the effects of the natural ovarian hormones estradiol and progesterone on cardiovascular function at rest and exercise. The purpose of this study was to investigate the short- and longer-term effects of a cyclic format of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (1 mg estradiol daily with cyclic micronized progesterone, 200 mg for 10 d/month) on cardiovascular function at rest and during exercise in healthy, postmenopausal women. A double-blind, cross-over study was conducted in 31 patients. Peak oxygen uptake and ventilatory threshold in addition to submaximal cardiac output were determined. Peripheral measures of resting and peak ischemic blood flows were also determined. Measurements were made at baseline, after 4 h of estrogen/placebo exposure, and subsequently after 1, 2, and 3 months. The sequence of data collection was repeated after 6-wk washout. Oral estradiol with cyclic micronized progesterone increases peak ischemic peripheral blood flow chronically but fails to improve exercise tolerance and peak oxygen uptake. Similarly, submaximal central cardiovascular function is unaffected by HRT. This suggests that estradiol has a beneficial effect on peripheral blood flow, but this benefit offers little advantage in terms of peak exercise performance after 3 months of HRT.
Activated JNK has been reported to be located in nucleus in mild cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but is exclusively in cytoplasm in more advanced stages of AD and implicated in its pathogenesis, suggesting that activation and re-distribution of JNK correlate with the progress of AD. The present study was designed to investigate the role of JNK in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (i.c.v. STZ) induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress. Streptozotocin has been observed to impair learning and memory, increase oxidative-nitritive stress, induce cholinergic hypofunction and neuronal damage in rat brain. Chronic treatment with SP600125 from day 10 to 28 following i.c.v. STZ injections significantly improved spatial memory, attenuate oxidative-nitritive stress. In addition, significant increase in acetylcholinesterase activity and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels was observed in the present model indicating cholinergic hypofunction and increase in neuronal cell damage. Whereas, SP600125 treatment significantly restored acetylcholinesterase activity and reduced LDH levels indicating restorative capacity of SP600125 with respect to cholinergic functions and preventing the neuronal damage. In line with previous report, the current study also supports the potential of JNK inhibition as a possible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate neurodegenerative disorders associated with oxidative stress and cognitive impairment.
7-Nitro indazole (25-100 mg/kg i.p.), an inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase, attenuated the severity of pilocarpine (300 mg/kg i.p.)-induced seizures in mice. This indicates that the decreased neuroexcitability of the central nervous system (CNS) following administration of 7-nitro indazole may be due to inhibition of neuronal NO synthase, implying that NO acts as an excitatory and proconvulsant factor in the CNS.
The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of early-onset methamphetamine (MAMP) use in early adolescence with psychiatric morbidity in adolescents with MAMP use by gender. A total of 299 adolescents with MAMP use in Taiwan were recruited from two juvenile detention centers in Kaohsiung and Taipei from September 1998 to March 2002. Using the Kiddie epidemiological version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-E), each adolescent was interviewed by a child psychiatrist to determine what psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs) and other psychiatric comorbidities might be associated with the early-onset (15 years old or below) MAMP use according to gender. In females, early-onset MAMP use was significantly associated with the diagnoses of depressive disorder, conduct disorder and amphetamine use disorder. In males, however, early-onset MAMP use was only significantly associated with amphetamine use disorder. Gender differences exist in the association between early-onset MAMP use and psychiatric morbidity. The association between early-onset MAMP use and psychiatric morbidity may have important implications for public health policy and treatment for adolescents with MAMP use.
We measured plasma levels of tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to examine the relationship between TFPI and vascular endothelial cell injury. TF antigen was detected in the plasma of healthy volunteers, and the levels were significantly increased in the patients with DIC, but decreased slightly in those with TTP. Plasma TFPI levels were significantly decreased in patients with TTP compared with those in healthy volunteers. The concentration of plasma thrombomodulin (TM) antigen was significantly higher in those with TTP than in normal volunteers. One month after treatment, TTP patients showed a significant decrease in plasma TM levels, and a significant increase in plasma TFPI levels, but plasma levels of TF antigen were not significantly increased. As plasma TFPI/TF ratio was significantly increased after treatment, the hypercoagulable state was therefore improved after treatment. There was no significant difference in plasma TF and TFPI levels between those who achieved complete remission (CR) and those who died. However, plasma TM levels were significantly higher in those who died than in those who achieved CR. Plasma TFPI levels might reflect injury of vascular endothelial cells as do plasma TM levels, and decreased plasma TFPI/TF ratio and vascular endothelial cell injuries might play causative roles in TTP.
A patient developed fever and acute hepatitis shortly after enflurane anaesthesia. Other causes of postoperative hepatitis were excluded. Cross-sensitization with halothane may have occurred, and the enflurane hepatitis may have been aggravated by halothane hepatitis.
Pyrimethamine is an antimalarial drug that has also been used successfully to treat autoimmune diseases such as lymphoproliferative syndrome. In this work, the effect of pyrimethamine (PYR) on the production of free radicals in malaria-infected mice was studied to better understand the drug's immunomodulatory properties. BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice were infected with Plasmodium yoelii 17XL. Seven days after infection, mice were treated with PYR or vehicle and sacrificed 24h later. Treatment with PYR increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in erythrocytes and the liver, augmented the levels of nitric oxide in the serum, and upregulated mRNA levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and iNOS in the spleen. In addition, PYR increased lipoperoxidation and protein carbonylation in infected mice. Our results indicate that P. yoelii 17XL reduces oxidative stress in infected cells, while PYR induces it, which is associated with increased parasite elimination. Thus, it is possible that oxidative stress generated by pyrimethamine is also involved in its immunomodulatory mechanism of action.
The amyloid beta protein (ABP) is a 40 to 42 amino acid peptide which accumulates in Alzheimer's disease plaques. It has been demonstrated that this peptide and a fragment derived from it are cytotoxic for cultured cortical nerve cells. It is shown here that ABP and an internal fragment encompassing residues 25 to 35 (beta 25-35) are cytotoxic to a clone of PC12 cells at concentrations above 1 x 10(-9)M and to several other cell lines at higher concentrations. Between 10(-9) and 10(-11) M beta 25-35 protects PC12 cells from glutamate toxicity. The antioxidant and free radical scavenger vitamin E inhibits ABP induced cell death. These results have implications regarding the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
The effect of pinacidil and cromakalim, two KATP channel openers, on intestinal transit and castor oil-induced diarrhea was studied in mice. Both drugs, administered orally, dose dependently inhibited the intestinal propulsion of charcoal, and castor oil-induced diarrhea, comparing favorably with morphine. These results may suggest a new approach for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea.
Heparin is a natural proteoglycan that was first described in 1916. In addition to its well characterized effect on blood coagulation, it is becoming clear that heparin also modulates inflammatory processes on several levels, including the interference with leukocyte-endothelium interaction. Anecdotal observations suggest a better clinical outcome of heparin-treated patients with bacterial meningitis. The authors demonstrate that heparin, a glycosaminoglycan, inhibits significantly in the early phase of experimental pneumococcal meningitis the increase of 1) regional cerebral blood flow (125 +/- 18 versus 247 +/- 42%), 2) intracranial pressure (4.5 +/- 2.0 versus 12.1 +/- 2.2 mm Hg), 3) brain edema (brain water content: 78.23 +/- 0.33 versus 79.49 +/- 0.46%), and 4) influx of leukocytes (571 +/- 397 versus 2400 +/- 875 cells/microL) to the cerebrospinal fluid compared with untreated rats. To elucidate the possible mechanism of this observation, the authors investigated for the first time leukocyte rolling in an inflammatory model in brain venules by confocal laser scanning microscopy in vivo. Heparin significantly attenuates leukocyte rolling at 2, 3, and 4 hours (2.8 +/- 1.3 versus 7.9 +/- 3.2/100 microm/min), as well as leukocyte sticking at 4 hours (2.1 +/- 0.4 versus 3.5 +/- 1.0/100 microm/min) after meningitis induction compared with untreated animals. The authors conclude that heparin can modulate acute central nervous system inflammation and, in particular, leukocyte-endothelium interaction, a key process in the cascade of injury in bacterial meningitis. They propose to evaluate further the potential of heparin in central nervous system inflammation in basic and clinical studies.
We describe the clinical and pathological features of acute renal failure which occurred in a patient receiving a first course of antituberculous therapy, including daily rifampicin. Renal biopsy specimens demonstrated an interstitial nephritis. The renal lesion resolved three weeks after the cessation of rifampicin, as evidenced by improvement in renal function and the return of nuclear magnetic resonance tomographic studies to normal. This is only the fifth reported instance of renal impairment following continuous rifampicin therapy, despite widespread use of the drug in a daily dose. The possible toxic interaction of rifampicin and antituberculous drugs which are excreted predominantly by the kidneys is also described.
Nearly 9 million workers are exposed to chemical agents associated with occupational asthma, with isocyanates representing the chemical class most responsible. Isocyanate-induced asthma has been difficult to diagnose and control, in part because the biologic mechanisms responsible for the disease and the determinants of exposure have not been well defined. Isocyanate-induced asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, and we hypothesized that inflammation is a prerequisite of isocyanate-induced asthma, with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha being critical to this process. To explore this hypothesis, wild-type mice, athymic mice, TNF-alpha receptor knockout (TNFR), and anti-TNF-alpha antibody-treated mice were sensitized by subcutaneous injection (20 micro l on Day 1; 5 micro l, Days 4 and 11), and challenged 7 d later by inhalation (100 ppb; Days 20, 22, and 24) with toluene diisocyanate (TDI). Airway inflammation, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial cell damage, and nonspecific airway reactivity to methacholine challenge, measured 24 h following the last challenge, were reduced to baseline levels in TNF-alpha null mice and athymic mice. TNF-alpha deficiency also markedly abrogated TDI-induced Th2 cytokines in airway tissues, indicating a role in the development of Th2 responses. Despite abrogation of all indicators of asthma pathology, TNF-alpha neutralization had no effect on serum IgE levels or IgG-specific TDI antibodies, suggesting the lack of importance of a humoral response in the manifestation of TDI-induced asthma. Instillation studies with fluorescein-conjugated isothiocyanate and TDI suggested that TNF-alpha deficiency also resulted in a significant reduction in the migration of airway dendritic cells to the draining lymph nodes. Taken together, these results suggest that, unlike protein antigens, TNF-alpha has multiple and central roles in TDI-induced asthma, influencing both nonspecific inflammatory processes and specific immune events.
The time-course of monoamine and tyrosine hydroxylase depletion after single-dose administration of D-methamphetamine (40 mg/kg s.c.) was investigated in caudate-putamen of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Times evaluated were 6, 12, 48, 72 and 240 h following treatment. Tyrosine hydroxylase was significantly reduced by 29, 60, 66, 76 and 76% of control at each of the respective post-treatment time intervals. Dopamine was not reduced 6 h following treatment. Dopamine was significantly reduced by 53, 57, 68 and 74% 12, 48, 72 and 240 h post-treatment, respectively. Reductions in caudate-putamen serotonin began earlier and were ultimately larger than for dopamine, with significant reductions of 28, 33 55, 74 and 81% at each of the respective post-treatment intervals. Confirmation of neurotoxicity was provided by measurement of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 240 h post-treatment. GFAP was increased at this time interval by 150% above control. Methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia during the 6 h immediately after treatment was comparable among the groups of animals used for analyses at each time interval. The results demonstrate that methamphetamine-induced monoamine reductions in the caudate-putamen occur rapidly, peak at 75-80% below controls, and last for at least 10 days after a single dose. These effects are as large or larger than those reported after the commonly used 10 mg/kgx4 dose treatment regimen administered at 2-h intervals and provides an alternate model for the investigation of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.
Diuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] is a substituted urea herbicide carcinogenic to the rat urinary bladder at high dietary levels. The suggested non-genotoxic mode of action (MOA) of diuron encompasses cytotoxicity and necrosis followed by regenerative hyperplasia. Prenecrotic swollen cells as observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been reported as early morphological alterations, putatively related to diuron cytotoxicity. However, these changes were not observed in a previous SEM study conducted in this laboratory. This study evaluated whether these early alterations are actually due to diuron cytotoxicity or artifacts related to different processing methods used for SEM analysis. Male Wistar rats were fed ad libitum with basal diet, 7.1% sodium saccharin (NaS) or 2.500ppm diuron for seven days or 15 weeks. The urinary bladders were processed for histological and labeling indices examinations and for SEM using two different processing methods. The incidence of simple hyperplasia after 15 weeks of exposure to diuron or to NaS was significantly increased. By SEM, the incidences and severity of lesions were significantly increased in the diuron group independently of exposure time. The different SEM processing methods used allowed for visualization of swollen superficial cells after seven days of diuron exposure. Probably the absence these cells in a previous study was due to the use very few animals. Our results support the hypothesis that the swollen cell is an early key event due to diuron-induced cytotoxicity and is the result of a degenerative process involved in the non-genotoxic carcinogenic mode of action of high doses of diuron.
We report on the case of a 64 year old male who received chemotherapy for a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. The chemotherapeutic regimen consisted of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin. Six hours after completion of the first 24 h continuous infusion of 5-FU, the patient developed severe chest pain accompanied by vegetative symptoms and a pronounced ST-elevation of the precordial leads. Under the suspicion of an acute anterior myocardial infarction an immediate coronary angiogram was performed, demonstrating a total occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery close to the left main stem. The other coronary arteries appeared smooth. After the intracoronary administration of nitroglycerine, the LAD reopened spontaneously without any residual stenosis, paralleled by complete relief of all symptoms. Therefore, 5-FU induced coronary spasm was diagnosed. After initial therapy with intravenous nitrate followed by oral calcium channel blocker, the patient remained free of symptoms and no rise in cardiac enzymes were noted. The chemotherapeutic regimen was changed to cisplatin plus docetaxel. No new attacks of chest pain occurred and the antivasospastic therapy could be stopped without further events.
A 58-year-old man presented to the emergency department with sudden onset rapid palpitations and significant presyncope while walking on the flat. The previous day he had undergone DC cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF) which had been initially successful. However, 6 h after cardioversion he was aware of intermittently raised but regular heart rates. On arrival at the emergency department (ED) he was well with no haemodynamic compromise. The ECG showed an atrial tachycardia instead of AF. Medications consisted of propafenone 300 mg twice daily, bisoprolol 5 mg at night and warfarin. Bisoprolol was increased to 5 mg twice daily and he was discharged with a plan for outpatient ablation. He collapsed in the hospital car park with rapid palpitations, chest tightness and vagal symptoms. On return to the ED he was hypotensive with a heart rate of 200 bpm. The ECG showed 1:1 atrioventricular conduction (AV) of the atrial tachycardia which promptly improved after administering intravenous atenolol. Class 1c antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone can precipitate 1:1 AV conduction of atrial tachycardias resulting in dangerous exacerbations of ventricular rate or even malignant tachyarrhythmias. It is therefore essential that concomitant AV blocking agents are used both prophylactically or acutely in suspected cases.
To explore the patterns of neuronal activity in the basal ganglia nucleus in parkinsonian patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID).
Sixteen idiopathic parkinsonian patients, 11 males and 5 female: 5; aged 56.1 +/- 11.9, with the mean disease duration of (10.1 +/- 6.6). years and Hoehn & Yahr score ranging 2 -4, all with the symptoms of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, 8 with severe LID [with the mean unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) IV score of 6.8 +/- 1.5] underwent pallidotomy (n = 8) or subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation (6 bilaterally and 2 unilaterally). Microrecording was performed in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and STN. Electromyogram (EMG) on the contralateral limbs to surgery was simultaneously recorded. Single unit analysis was performed. The interspike interval (ISI) and coefficient of variation (CV) of ISI were calculated. One-way ANOVA and rank test were employed to compare the ISI and CV among the patients.
Two hundred and thirty-eight neurons were identified from the GPi (n = 8) and STN (n = 14). 22.6% of them were tremor-related neurons, 33.8% were rapid tonic neuronal activity[ related, and 29.0% were irregular neuronal activity-related. It was discovered that 8. 0% of the neurons from GPi and STN were with grouped discharge following long period pause with the CV of 87 +/- 0.55, and 7.5% of the neurons were with low frequency firing with the mean frequency of (17.7 +/- 5.9) Hz. ANOVA revealed that in the STN the CV of the neurons with irregular with grouped discharge was significantly higher than those of the neurons with irregular neuronal activity and with low frequency firing (both P < 0.05), the ISI of the neurons with irregular grouped discharge was significantly higher than that of the neurons with low frequency firing and significantly higher than that of the neurons irregular neuronal activity (both P < 0.05); and in the GPi the CV of the neurons with irregular grouped discharge was significantly lower than those of the neurons with irregular neuronal activity and those with low frequency firing and the ISI of the neurons with irregular grouped discharge was significantly higher than those of the other groups (all P < 0.05). Chi square test showed that majority of the neurons with grouped discharge and neurons with low frequency firing mainly existed in the GPi and STN of the PD patients with LID (all P < 0.05).
The altered neuronal activity in the basal ganglia nucleus of GPi and STN plays an important role in the pathophysiology of PD and LID.
Reducing hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication to minimal levels is emerging as a key therapeutic goal for chronic hepatitis B.
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, 1370 patients with chronic hepatitis B were randomly assigned to receive 600 mg of telbivudine or 100 mg of lamivudine once daily. The primary efficacy end point was noninferiority of telbivudine to lamivudine for therapeutic response (i.e., a reduction in serum HBV DNA levels to fewer than 5 log10 copies per milliliter, along with loss of hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] or normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels). Secondary efficacy measures included histologic response, changes in serum HBV DNA levels, and HBeAg responses.
At week 52, a significantly higher proportion of HBeAg-positive patients receiving telbivudine than of those receiving lamivudine had a therapeutic response (75.3% vs. 67.0%, P=0.005) or a histologic response (64.7% vs. 56.3%, P=0.01); telbivudine also was not inferior to lamivudine for these end points in HBeAg-negative patients. In HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, telbivudine was superior to lamivudine with respect to the mean reduction in the number of copies of HBV DNA from baseline, the proportion of patients with a reduction in HBV DNA to levels undetectable by polymerase-chain-reaction assay, and development of resistance to the drug. Elevated creatine kinase levels were more common in patients who received telbivudine, whereas elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were more common in those who received lamivudine.
Among patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, the rates of therapeutic and histologic response at 1 year were significantly higher in patients treated with telbivudine than in patients treated with lamivudine. In both the HBeAg-negative and the HBeAg-positive groups, telbivudine demonstrated greater HBV DNA suppression with less resistance than did lamivudine. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00057265 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).
The authors describe a case of acute hyperammonemia after the addition of valproate to the medication regimen of a patient on multiple psychotropic medications. The patient presented with acute mental-status changes consistent with delirium. With prompt intervention and supportive care, her delirium quickly cleared.
To investigate the effects of beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR) stimulation on endotoxin-induced liver damage and systemic cytokine levels in rats.
Standard male Wistar rats.
A disease-model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute systemic inflammation was used. The beta(2)-selective AR agonist clenbuterol was administered before, during, and after LPS-challenge to investigate its effects on the acute inflammatory response and associated liver-failure.
The following parameters have been measured in plasma: TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, AST, ALT, and Bilirubin. Liver histological examination was performed to look for changes in tissue morphology.
Administration of clenbuterol (p.o.) one hour before, or intravenous at the same time as LPS-challenge resulted in a marked reduction of plasma levels of TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. A change both in plasma-level and in time-concentration profile of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was found. Clenbuterol minimized LPS-induced liver damage, as represented by significantly lowered concentrations of several parameters for liver-failure (AST, ALT, Bilirubin), and improved hepatic tissue morphology. Clenbuterol administration after LPS challenge failed to inhibit TNF alpha-release but reduced liver-damage. Simultaneous use of the beta(2)-AR antagonist propranolol augmented LPS-induced liver failure, suggesting a role of endogenous adrenoceptor-agonists in prevention of organ-failure during systemic inflammation.
The results indicate that a selective beta(2)-AR agonist might be used as an additional therapeutic agent in the clinic for the treatment of (acute) systemic inflammatory disorders in order to reduce or prevent subsequent liver failure.
In the normal murine mucosal plexus, blood flow is generally smooth and continuous. In inflammatory conditions, such as chemically-induced murine colitis, the mucosal plexus demonstrates markedly abnormal flow patterns. The inflamed mucosal plexus is associated with widely variable blood flow velocity as well as discontinuous and even bidirectional flow. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for these blood flow patterns, we used intravital microscopic examination of blood flow within the murine mucosal plexus during dextran sodium sulphate-and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis. The blood flow patterns within the mucosal plexus demonstrated flow exclusion in 18% of the vessel segments (P < 0.01). Associated with these segmental exclusions was significant variation in neighboring flow velocities. Intravascular injection of fluorescent platelets demonstrated platelet incorporation into both fixed and rolling platelet aggregates. Rolling platelet aggregates (mean velocity 113 microm/sec; range, 14-186 microm/sec) were associated with reversible occlusions and flow variations within the mucosal plexus. Gene expression profiles of microdissected mucosal plexus demonstrated enhanced expression of genes for CCL3, CXCL1, CCL2, CXCL5, CCL7, CCL8, and Il-1b (P < 0.01), and decreased expression of CCL6 (P < 0.01). These results suggest that platelet aggregation, activated by the inflammatory mileau, contributes to the complex flow dynamics observed in acute murine colitis.
To describe successful treatment of tardive dyskinesia with levetiracetam.
Tardive dyskinesia is a late-onset movement disorder caused by exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents, most commonly neuroleptics. Metoclopramide is frequently used to treat gastrointestinal dysmotility. It has antidopaminergic properties, and is estimated to be responsible for two-thirds of drug-related movement disorders.
Case report.
A 68-year-old woman presented with a history of intestinal transplantation (12 years ago; short gut syndrome related to bowel resection for rectal carcinoma) and renal transplantation (1 year ago; diabetes). She developed involuntary movements with stereotypic oro-buccal-lingual dyskinesias and right-sided choreiform movements. Her Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale score (AIMS) score was 27. She has been treated with metoclopramide for gastrointestinal dysmotility for more than 10 years and was diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia. Treatment with levetiracetam 250 mg orally b.i.d. led to a significant improvement of abnormal movements within a week. Her AIMS score decreased to 8.
Tardive dyskinesia may be quite disabling and options include withdrawal of offending medication, or use of tetrabenazine or reserpine. Several reports also suggested improvement of tardive movement disorders with levetiracetam. In our patient, levetiracetam relieved symptoms of tardive dyskinesia and allowed continuous use of metoclopramide. Larger studies are needed to confirm its efficacy.
To report a suspected case of isoniazid-induced psychosis in a 31-year-old woman.
A 31-year-old white woman without a prior psychiatric history presented with psychotic symptoms suspected to be related to prophylactic treatment with isoniazid after she tested positive to a tuberculin (purified protein derivative) test. The psychotic symptoms resolved partially after isoniazid was discontinued and completely after treatment with olanzapine was begun. The patient remained symptom-free 11 months after discharge from the hospital.
Cases of isoniazid-related psychiatric disorders reported in the literature include psychosis, obsessive-compulsive neurosis, and mania. With the increasing prevalence of tuberculosis in the US, more people are expected to receive treatment for tuberculosis. Pyridoxine deficiency may play a role in the pathogenesis of isoniazid-induced psychosis. Such deficiency states may be detected indirectly by measuring urinary metabolites of tryptophan.
Clinicians should be aware of this adverse effect of isoniazid and that it may present with a broad clinical picture.
Arsenic trioxide (ATO) and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib have been successfully applied to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and multiple myeloma (MM), respectively. Their synergistic effects with other anticancer drugs have been widely studied. Here, we investigated the potential synergy of bortezomib and ATO on Bcr-Abl(+) leukemic K562 cells. The results showed that cotreatment of bortezomib at 32 nM, a half concentration for growth arrest, and ATO at 1 microM, a dose with no significant cytotoxic effect, synergistically induced apoptosis in the cell line, followed by enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction, release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, caspase-3 cleavage and degradation of poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase together with the decreased Bcr-Abl protein. These two drugs synergistically induced proteolytic activation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) with enhanced activation of two mitogen-activated protein kinases phospho-c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase and p38. The specific PKCdelta inhibitor rottlerin markedly decreased bortezomib plus ATO-induced apoptosis, suggesting that PKCdelta plays an important role in bortezomib plus ATO-induced apoptosis. Moreover, apoptosis synergy of bortezomib and ATO could also be seen in some kinds of acute leukemic cell lines and primary cells. Totally, our results indicate that combined regimen of bortezomib and ATO might be a potential therapeutic remedy for the treatment of leukemia.
