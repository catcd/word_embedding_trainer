The aim of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of morphine and morphine 6-glucuronide (M6G) in children with cancer. Serum concentrations of morphine and M6G in children who received single oral or short term continuous intravenous morphine were determined by HPLC and ELISA assays, respectively. The serum C(max) of morphine and M6G after i.v. morphine administration was 560.5 and 309.0 nM and the T(max) was 61 and 65 min, respectively. The elimination half-life was 140.0 and 328.7 min, respectively. After oral administration of morphine, the serum C(max) of morphine and M6G was 408.34 and 256.3 nM and the T(max) was 40.0 and 60 min, respectively. The half-life was 131.0 and 325.8 min, respectively. The side effects were: drowsiness (100%), nausea and/or vomiting (57%), pruritus (28%) and urinary retention (14%). There were no reports of respiratory complications. This study showed that pharmacokinetics factors of morphine and M6G in children were significantly different from adults. Therefore the required dose for children should be different from that of adults and should be based on studies performed on children rather than on studies on adults. Some adverse effects, particularly nausea and pruritus, may be commoner than is usually thought, while others, particularly respiratory problems did not occur.
Within recent years the number of children with focal segmental glomerulonephritis (FSGS) has increased. A significant progress in defining of molecular basis of the disease has been made. Gene mutations for nephrin, podocin, WT1, alpha-actinin 4 cause the damage of filtration barrier of glomerulus and proteinuria in consequence. A girl (S.G.) became ill at the age of 3.5, suffering form steroid-resistant nephritic syndrome (SRNS) with microscopic hematuria. The renal biopsy showed FSGS accompanied by a complete diffuse effacement of podocyte food processes. Despite intensive and regular immunosuppressive therapy, remission was not achieved. In the control renal biopsy performed a year after cyclosporin A had been applied, 50% of globally sclerosed glomeruli as well as some features of post-cyclosporin damage were found. The girl required renal replacement therapy at the age of 10.5. Dialyzed at the adult dialysis centre she died at the age of 11.5. A boy S.P. was diagnosed with SRNS when he was 11.5 years old. The renal biopsy was performed after one month of treatment and showed mesangial proliferation and diffuse effacement of podocyte food processes. After chlorambucil treatment remission was not achieved, and after methylprednisolon pulse therapy only the reduction of proteinuria was achieved. In a control renal biopsy 10 out of 13 glomeruli were globally sclerosed. At the age of 17 the patient showed chronic renal failure with a fast progression of the disease. In September 2000 the boy started renal replacement therapy, an in June 2001 he received a renal transplant without the recurrence of FGS. In 2001 a heterozygous mutation (A284V) in gene NPHS2 was found in both of the siblings. Within the confines of the clinical project ESCAPE Trial another genetic examination was performed. In the boy one missense mutation on one allele (A284V) and the R229Q polymorphism on the other allele were found. In this family the father is bear. ing the A284V mutation and the mother the R229Q variant. These results prove that this disease is due to alterations of the podocin gene in the described family.
Bardoxolone methyl (BARD) is an antioxidant modulator that acts through induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. This study aimed to investigate the role of BARD in protecting kidneys from aristolochic acid (AA)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Male C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of aristolochic acid I (AAI) (5mg/kg/day) for 5 days to produce acute AA nephropathy (AAN) model. BARD (10mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for 7 consecutive days, starting 2 days prior to AAI administration. The mice in the AA group showed AKI as evidenced by worsening kidney function evaluated by blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) levels, and severe tubulointerstitial injury marked by massive tubule necrosis in kidney tissues. BARD significantly reduced BUN and SCr levels which were elevated by AAI. Additionally, AAI-induced histopathological renal damage was ameliorated by BARD. Furthermore, the expression of Nrf2 was reduced, and its repressor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) was increased significantly, whereas heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was upregulated and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) was barely increased in the cytoplasm of tubules in kidneys after treatment with AAI. BARD significantly upregulated renal Nrf2, NQO1 and HO-1 expression and downregulated Keap1 expression compared with those in the AA group. Moreover, it was found that Nrf2 was expressed both in the cytoplasm and nuclear of glomeruli and tubules, whereas NQO1 and HO-1 were localized in the cytoplasm of tubules only. In conclusion, AA-induced acute renal injury was associated with impaired Nrf2 activation and expression of its downstream target genes in renal tissues. BARD prevented renal damage induced by AAI, and this renoprotective effect may be exerted by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway and increasing expression of the downstream target genes.
Recent studies suggest that chemotherapy, in addition to its cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, can induce a cascade of host events to support tumor growth and spread. Here, we used an experimental pulmonary metastasis model to investigate the role of this host response in metastasis formation. Mice were pretreated with chemotherapy and after clearance of the drugs from circulation, tumor cells were administered intravenously to study potential "protumorigenic" host effects of chemotherapy. Pretreatment with the commonly used chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin and paclitaxel significantly enhanced lung metastasis in this model. This corresponded to enhanced adhesion of tumor cells to an endothelial cell monolayer that had been pretreated with chemotherapy in vitro. Interestingly, chemotherapy exposure enhanced the expression of VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) on endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. Administration of antibodies targeting VEGFR-1 reversed the early retention of tumor cells in the lungs, thereby preventing the formation of chemotherapy-induced pulmonary metastases. The data indicate that chemotherapy-induced expression of VEGFR-1 on endothelial cells can create an environment favorable to tumor cell homing. Inhibition of VEGFR-1 function may therefore be used to counteract chemotherapy-induced retention of tumor cells within the metastatic niche, providing a novel level of tumor control in chemotherapy.
To determine the effect of cyclophosphamide and prednisone on progressive renal failure and on nephrotic features in patients with membranous glomerulonephritis.
Prospective, nonrandomized time series.
Outpatient clinic at a university medical center.
Eleven consecutive patients with biopsy-proven membranous glomerulonephritis and rising plasma creatinine levels over at least 6 months.
Cyclophosphamide and prednisone in ten patients and cyclophosphamide alone in one patient.
In ten patients treated with both agents, the median plasma creatinine rose 53 mumol/L (0.6 mg/dL) over the months before treatment from 141 to 194 mumol/L (1.6 to 2.2 mg/dL) (95% CI, 27 to 141 mumol/L; P = 0.002). After combined therapy for 6 months, the median plasma creatinine fell to 133 mumol/L (1.5 mg/dL) for a median decline of 62 mumol/L (0.7 mg/dL) (CI, 44 to 150 mumol/L; P = 0.006). Pretreatment plasma creatinine levels, which ranged from 159 to 371 mumol/L (1.8 to 4.2 mg/dL), decreased in the ten patients by 6 months and remained stable in seven of the eight patients followed 24 to 54 months after therapy was completed. The median urine protein excretion decreased by 9.6 g/d with 12 months of therapy in the ten patients from 11.9 to 2.3 g/d (CI, 6.0 to 15.1 g/d; P less than 0.001). The median plasma albumin rose by 14 g/L from 24 to 38 g/L (CI, 11 to 19 g/L; P less than 0.001). The median plasma cholesterol fell by 3.26 mumol/L (140 mg/dL) from 10.45 to 6.52 mumol/L (405 to 252 mg/dL) (CI, 1.42 to 7.16 mumol/L; P = 0.01). One patient who had a relapse 30 months after completing therapy responded to re-treatment with renal function and nephrotic variables returning toward normal. The eleventh patient received cyclophosphamide alone and had a course similar to that of the combined therapy group.
Cyclophosphamide plus prednisone can promote prolonged remissions in membranous glomerulonephritis even when renal function is already declining.
The treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in pregnancy is reviewed.
PAH is a disease characterized by narrowing of the pulmonary arteries and increased vascular resistance. Women with PAH should avoid becoming pregnant, as the physiological, cardiovascular, and pulmonary changes that occur during pregnancy can exacerbate the condition. However, several viable treatment options are available to improve the outcomes in this patient population, including inhaled nitric oxide, calcium-channel blockers, targeted pulmonary vasodilators, and sildenafil. Epoprostenol, a naturally occurring prostaglandin and vasodilator, is a pregnancy category B drug. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits have found no impaired fertility or fetal harm at 2.5-4.8 times the recommended human dosage of epoprostenol. Most of the published case reports describe initiating epoprostenol 2-4 ng/kg/min i.v. several weeks before or near the time of delivery. Iloprost is a pregnancy category C drug but has demonstrated benefit in pregnant patients with PAH, with no congenital abnormalities and no postpartum maternal or infant mortality reported. Sildenafil causes vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and vasodilation in the systemic circulation. Two case reports have described the successful treatment with sildenafil, a pregnancy category B drug, of pregnant patients with PAH. Patients with idiopathic PAH or chronic thromboembolic PAH should receive full-dose subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin therapy instead of warfarin for bleeding prophylaxis during pregnancy.
Targeted pulmonary vasodilators are viable treatment options for pregnant patients with PAH. Early recognition and management of worsening symptoms are essential to improve outcomes for both the mother and infant.
Five patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin had ischemic stroke within 2 to 5 days after the drug infusion. This occurred during the second course of chemotherapy in three patients, and during the third course in two patients. There may be a relation between treatment and brain infarction because 1) there was no other cause identified despite extensive tests, including postmortem examination in one patient; 2) there was a short delay between treatment infusion and stroke; and 3) there was a similar pattern of ischemic stroke after the second or third course of chemotherapy.
In a double-blind and cross-over trial, 12 healthy volunteers received single oral doses of maprotiline 75 mg, doxepin 25 mg, zimeldine 200 mg and placebo, alone and with alcohol (1 g/kg), at one-week intervals. Objective tests of performance (tracking, choice reaction, flicker fusion, body sway, nystagmus, Maddox wing) and ratings of subjective feelings were done before the drug intake (baseline) and 1 1/2, 3, 4 1/2, 6 and 7 1/2 hr after it. Maprotiline and doxepin proved subjectively sedative, whilst doxepin and zimeldine prolonged choice reaction time. An increase of alcohol effects was seen clearly after doxepin, to lesser extent after maprotiline and not at all after zimeldine. On the contrary, zimeldine antagonized alcohol-induced impairment in the tracking test.
Recent statistics from the National Institute on Drug Abuse indicate that cocaine abuse continues to be a significant public health problem. Between 1988 and 1990 at Grady Memorial Hospital in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, we identified 12 patients in whom subarachnoid hemorrhage was temporally related to cocaine abuse. All 12 patients had underlying cerebral aneurysms that had ruptured. Currently, the incidence of ruptured intracranial aneurysms in patients with cocaine-induced subarachnoid hemorrhage is 84.9% (mean age, 31.1 years; overall mortality, 60.5%). Hypertension is the likely precursive factor in cocaine-induced aneurysmal rupture. Cocaine abuse appears to be a significant negative factor in the natural history of cerebral aneurysms, especially in young adults. We review the epidemiology of cocaine-induced subarachnoid hemorrhage and its effects on the cerebral circulation, and suggest guidelines for patient management.
A patient with extensive pulmonary tuberculosis developed hypercalcaemia following rifampicin-induced interstitial nephritis.
Insomnia is a common and disabling complaint for which there is a need for improved treatments. Successful drug discovery relies on the use of appropriate animal models to assess likely outcome in the clinic.
The purpose of this study was to develop a translational, caffeine-induced model of insomnia in rats and healthy volunteers. We used sleep onset latency (SOL) as a comparable sleep measure between the two species. The model was validated by two effective sleep-promoting agents with different pharmacology, zolpidem and trazodone, which have GABA-ergic and serotonergic mechanisms, respectively.
In rats, radiotelemetry transmitters with electroencephalogram and electromyogram electrodes were implanted for sleep recording. Animals were administered with caffeine alone (10 mg/kg) or in combination with zolpidem (10 mg/kg) or trazodone (20 mg/kg), or vehicle, in crossover experiments. Home polysomnography was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers in a randomised, placebo-controlled, 4-week crossover study. Subjects received placebo, caffeine (150 mg) or caffeine in combination with zolpidem (10 mg) or trazodone (100 mg). Subjective sleep effects in volunteers were assessed using the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire.
Caffeine caused a significant prolongation in objective SOL in rats and humans. This effect was sensitive to zolpidem and trazodone, both of which attenuated the caffeine-induced increase in SOL. Furthermore, both hypnotics restored the disruption in subjective measures of sleep onset caused by caffeine in volunteers.
This model therefore provides a promising paradigm in which we can study novel treatments for sleep disorders and an opportunity for direct comparison of results between rodents and humans.
Current evidence suggests that, in a small subset of acute stroke patients who can be treated within 3 hours of symptom onset, the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) confers a modest outcome benefit, but that this benefit is associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage that can be severe or fatal. The data show that tPA therapy must be limited to carefully selected patients within established protocols. Further evidence is necessary to support the widespread application of stroke thrombolysis outside research settings. Until it is clear that the benefits of this therapy outweigh the risks, thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke should be restricted to use within formal research protocols or in monitored practice protocols that adhere to the NINDS (the rt-PA Stroke Study Group trial of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) eligibility criteria. All data on protocol compliance and patient outcomes should be collated in a central Canadian registry for the purposes of tracking safety and efficacy. Stroke thrombolysis should be limited to centers with appropriate neurological and neuro-imaging resources that are capable of administering treatment within 3 hours. In such centres, emergency physicians should identify eligible patients, initiate low risk interventions and facilitate prompt computed tomography. Only physicians with demonstrated expertise in neuroradiology should interpret head CT scans used to determine whether to administer thrombolytic agents to stroke patients. Neurologists should be directly involved prior to the thrombolytic administration.
The majority of patients with a diagnosis of cancer die from metastatic disease. Targeting specific steps in the metastatic process has the potential to improve patient outcomes. In this study, a novel lung metastasis model was developed by injecting DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbo-cyanine perchlorate)-labeled Lewis lung carcinoma cells into the tail vein of mice. The temporal development of tumor metastases was studied in the lung, liver and spleen. Additionally, the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor SU5416 and platelet activation inhibitor prostacyclin were tested in this metastasis model. Systemically injected Lewis lung carcinoma cells present in the lung at 15 min slowly accumulated in the liver and spleen reaching a peak at 4 days. After 8 days, tumor development was only evident in the lung. Use of SU5416 or prostacyclin lowered the initial density of Lewis lung carcinoma-labeled cells in the lung by a factor 1.8 and 2.3, respectively (P<0.05). Furthermore, treatment with prostacyclin or SU5416 decreased lung weight by over 50% and the number of visible metastatic nodes by over 90% (P<0.05). Combined treatment resulted in grossly normal lung tissue. Additionally, systemic treatment with prostacyclin reduced harvested metastatic cell adherence to endothelial cells by a factor of 10 and treatment with SU5416 attenuated vascular formation (P<0.001). In conclusion, SU5416 and prostacyclin effectively attenuated metastasis formation in this model. DiI labeling is an effective technique to monitor the temporal and spatial distribution of metastatic cells.
Cyclocytidine is a repository form of cytosine arabinoside and has a prolonged plasma half-life (8 hours) compared to cytosine arabinoside (12 minutes). A phase I trail was undertaken to establish the maximum tolerated dose. Nineteen patients were entered into the study (ten children, nine adults) and the dose which achieved consistent myelosuppression was established in five escalation increments as 600 mg/m for 10 days. This dose is consistent with previously reported data on the basic pharmacology of cyclocytidine and with optimum dose data in aminal tumor systems. Limiting toxicity, however, was related to the induction of postural hypotension which is not dose related. Recommendation to proceed with phase II studies of cyclocytidine must await clarification of the mechanism and prevention of the postural hypotension.
A 67-year-old patient, with primary polymyositis and without previous evidence of liver disease, developed clinical and biochemical features of severe cholestasis 3 months after initiation of azathioprine therapy. Liver biopsy showed cholestasis with both cytological and architectural alterations of interlobular bile ducts. Azathioprine withdrawal resulted after 7 weeks in the resolution of clinical and biochemical abnormalities. It is believed that this is the first reported case of reversible azathioprine-induced cholestasis associated with histological evidence of bile duct injury.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily. Recent studies have showed that aberrant methylation of BMP genes is present in several types of human cancer. We examined the expression and methylation status of BMP3b and BMP6 in malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPMs). The expression status of BMP3b, and BMP6 mRNAs were examined in seven MPM cell lines by RT-PCR assay. The expression of BMP3b was completely suppressed in 2 and partially suppressed in 2 of 7 cell lines and expression of BMP6 was partially suppressed in 2 cell lines. Methylation status of BMP3b in cell lines was determined by methylation-specific assay to find aberrant methylation in 6 cell lines which include 4 cell lines with suppressed BMP3b expression. Partial methylation of BMP6 was found in 2 cell lines whose expression was partially suppressed. Treatment with 5-Aza-dC restored BMP3b expression in methylated cell lines. Next, we examined the methylation status in 57 surgically resected MPM cases and found aberrant methylation of BMP3b in 9 (53%) out of 17 cases from Japan and 3 (8%) of 40 cases from USA and that of BMP6 in 4 (24%) cases from Japan and 12 (30%) cases from USA, showing significant difference in frequency of BMP3b methylation between MPMs of the two countries (P=0.0004). Our study indicated that BMP3b and BMP6 genes were suppressed by DNA methylation and methylation of BMP3b is significantly frequent in Japanese MPMs, suggesting its pathogenic role and the ethnic difference in MPMs.
Combined chemotherapy is the major therapeutic principle for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Adriamycin, etoposide plus ifosfamide (AVI) regimen has been used to treat SCLC for more than 10 years in Service of Respiratory Diseases, CHU de Bordeaux. This study was to analyze retrospectively the efficacy of AVI regimen on SCLC, and observe the adverse events.
We collected medical documents of 69 SCLC patients, treated wih AVI regimen in Service of Respiratory Diseases, CHU de Bordeaux, Hopital du Haut Leveque from Jan. 1994 to Dec. 2003. Response rate, adverse events, and survival were evaluated.
Of the 69 patients, 23 had limited disease (LD), 46 had extended disease (ED). The total objective response rate (OR) was 60.9% for all patients; it was significantly higher in LD patients than in ED patients (78.3% vs. 52.2%, P=0.04). The median progression-free survival time was 11.2 months for LD patients and 6.7 months for ED patients. The median survival time was 11.3 months for LD patients and 7.2 months for ED patients. The 1-year survival rate was 47.8% for LD patients and 30.4% for ED patients. Major adverse events included grade 3-4 neutropenia (34.8%), anemia (15.9%), nausea and vomit (18.8%).
AVI regimen is effective for SCLC. The major adverse events are neutropenia, anemia, nausea and vomit. In practice, AVI regimen could be a chemotherapeutic choice for SCLC.
Migraine is considered a neurovascular disease involving dilatation of cerebral arteries. Nitric oxide (NO) donors induce dilatation of cerebral and extracranial arteries and migraine, but NO has several mechanisms of action in addition to its cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-mediated vasodilatation. We examined whether sildenafil (Viagra), a selective inhibitor of cGMP-hydrolysing phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), which acts exclusively by increasing cGMP, can induce migraine and dilatation of cerebral arteries. We included 12 patients with migraine without aura in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, in which placebo or sildenafil 100 mg was administered orally on two separate days. Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V(mca)) was recorded by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and regional cerebral blood flow in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (rCBF(mca)) was measured using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) and xenon 133 inhalation. Radial and temporal artery diameters were studied using high-frequency ultrasonography. Headache response, tenderness of pericranial muscles, blood pressure and heart rate were measured repeatedly. We found that migraine attack was induced by sildenafil in 10 of 12 migraine patients and by placebo in two of 12 patients (P = 0.01). V(mca) (P = 0.1) and rCBF(mca) (P = 0.93) remained unchanged after sildenafil. Temporal (P = 0.47) and radial (P = 0.87) artery diameter and pericranial tenderness (P = 0.16) were unaffected by sildenafil. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were unchanged but heart rate increased from a mean of 62 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 3 beats/min (P = 0.01) after sildenafil. Our results demonstrate that migraine may be induced via a cGMP-dependent mechanism, and we show for the first time that this occurs without initial dilatation of the middle cerebral artery. We propose that triggering mechanisms may reside within the perivascular sensory nerve terminals or the brainstem. However, other sites of action may also be possible and future studies are needed to elucidate this. In the clinical use of sildenafil, patients who have migraine should be informed about the risk of migraine attacks.
Psychotic patients treated with clozapine often experience persistent daytime sleepiness. This is a frequent side effect of clozapine that may reduce patient compliance. We hypothesized that clozapine might interfere with the circadian rhythms regulated by the biological clock. In 171 patients with major psychosis, we investigated the association between hypersomnolence during clozapine therapy and a CLOCK gene polymorphism (3111 T/C substitution). Forty-six patients showed persistent daytime sleepiness and were classified as "sleepy". "Sleepy" patients were significantly more likely to have a mutated allele compared to both "non sleepy" patients and healthy subjects (chi2 = 20.36, d.f. = 1, P = 0.000007, and chi2 = 13.91, d.f. = 1, P = 0.0002, respectively). We conclude that an interaction between clozapine and the CLOCK gene polymorphism 3111 T/C substitution could explain persistent daytime sleepiness in a significant proportion of patients treated with clozapine.
Data obtained in laboratory animals and humans suggest that dopamine D1 receptor antagonists decrease cocaine self-administration and block cocaine's discriminative stimulus and subjective effects.
This study investigates the effects of the selective dopamine D1 antagonist, ecopipam (SCH 39166), on the reinforcing, cardiovascular, and subjective effects of cocaine in humans.
Ten non-treatment-seeking cocaine smokers (two females, eight males), residing on an inpatient research unit, were maintained on placebo and ecopipam (100 mg p.o.) in random order using a within-subjects, cross-over design. Cocaine self-administration (0, 12, 25, and 50 mg) was tested beginning on the 5th day of each 8-day maintenance condition. A six-trial choice procedure (cocaine vs $5 merchandise vouchers) was utilized, with sessions consisting of one sample trial, when participants smoked the cocaine dose available that day, and five choice trials, when participants chose between smoking the available cocaine dose or receiving one merchandise voucher.
In the presence of placebo cocaine, ecopipam significantly decreased cocaine craving while increasing alcohol and tobacco craving. In the presence of active cocaine, ecopipam increased cocaine self-administration (12 mg) and increased ratings of "good drug effect," "high," "stimulated," and dose quality (25 and 50 mg). Ecopipam produced small but significant increases in blood pressure, regardless of cocaine dose.
Maintenance on the long-acting dopamine D1 antagonist, ecopipam, enhanced both cocaine self-administration as well as its subjective effects compared to maintenance on placebo. These data suggest that chronic antagonism of the dopamine D1 receptor may not be a useful approach for the treatment of cocaine abuse.
The present study was developed to ascertain whether or not susceptibility to lidocaine-kindling persists into adulthood in perinatal hypothyroid rats. Pregnant Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: the first one, a control group, that drank tap water; and a second one, a hypothyroid group, were treated with 0.02% propylthiouracil in their drinking water from the 14th gestational day to the 10th postpartum day. The pups of both groups were maintained with food and tap water ad libitum until the experiment was over. The pups of each group were divided to test the susceptibility to lidocaine-kindling at 30 and 100 days old, for this, lidocaine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered daily. The seizures were usually present in the form of tonic attacks of fore and hind limbs, followed by intermittent clonic movements. An animal was considered kindled when it showed clonic movements for two consecutive days. We observed that the number of stimuli necessary to produce lidocaine-kindling seizures in hypothyroid rats was significantly lower than in the control group for both ages. Also, the percentage of kindled rats aged 30 days (73% and 89%) was greater than aged of 100 days (26% and 59%) in both control and hypothyroid groups, respectively. In conclusion, the perinatal hypothyroidism increases the susceptibility to lidocaine-kindling in adult rats.
Pulmonary toxicity induced by sulfur mustard and related vesicants is associated with oxidative stress. In the present studies we analyzed the role of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generated via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lung injury and inflammation induced by vesicants using 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) as a model. C57Bl/6 (WT) and iNOS-/- mice were sacrificed 3 days or 14 days following intratracheal administration of CEES (6 mg/kg) or control. CEES intoxication resulted in transient (3 days) increases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell and protein content in WT, but not iNOS-/- mice. This correlated with expression of Ym1, a marker of oxidative stress in alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. In contrast, in iNOS-/- mice, Ym1 was only observed 14 days post-exposure in enlarged alveolar macrophages, suggesting that they are alternatively activated. This is supported by findings that lung tumor necrosis factor and lipocalin Lcn2 expression, mediators involved in tissue repair were also upregulated at this time in iNOS-/- mice. Conversely, CEES-induced increases in the proinflammatory genes, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, were abrogated in iNOS-/- mice. In WT mice, CEES treatment also resulted in increases in total lung resistance and decreases in compliance in response to methacholine, effects blunted by loss of iNOS. These data demonstrate that RNS, generated via iNOS play a role in the pathogenic responses to CEES, augmenting oxidative stress and inflammation and suppressing tissue repair. Elucidating inflammatory mechanisms mediating vesicant-induced lung injury is key to the development of therapeutics to treat mustard poisoning.
We report on a 3-year-old boy with bilateral choanal atresia, hypoplastic nipples, and developmental delay who had been exposed to carbimazole in utero because of maternal Graves disease. His combination of abnormalities and facial appearance strongly resembles that of a previously reported child exposed to methimazole (which is the active metabolite of carbimazole) in utero. We suggest that this represents a rare but distinct syndrome of methimazole teratogenicity, probably related to first-trimester exposure. Recognition of such teratogenic effects is clearly important for genetic counselling and for management of subsequent pregnancies.
Dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), a potent hepatotoxin, administered to rats, provides a convenient model for toxic liver injury. Indicators of early liver injury are important clinically, for surveillance, for screening new drugs that are potentially hepatotoxic and for identifying drugs that protect against liver injury. Both cirrhosis and wound healing culminate in deposition of fibrous connective tissue and scarring. Increased hyaluronan (HA) occurs in the earliest stage of wound healing. Hyaluronidase, the enzyme that degrades hyaluronan, is also elevated whenever rapid turnover of hyaluronan occurs. We test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating hyaluronan and hyaluronidase could provide indicators of very early liver damage.
Dimethylnitrosamine was administered to adult male albino rats by intraperitoneal injections for 7 consecutive days.
Increased serum hyaluronan levels observed on day 2 reached a maximum on day 4. Hyaluronidase was elevated on the first day and reached a maximum on day 2 that was 30-times control levels. Hyaluronan-specific staining in liver sections was maximal on day 7, occurring predominantly in portal triads and in sinusoidal spaces. Individual hepatocytes were slightly enlarged and contained intracellular hyaluronan, which was not evident in control sections. Though circulating hyaluronan levels had decreased after day 4, continued hyaluronan staining persisted in liver sections through day 21. Conventional indicators of liver injury, such as serum aminotransferase enzymes, did not reach a peak until day 7. Conventional gross and histopathological changes, including severe centrilobular congestion and hemorrhagic necrosis, were observed only after day 7. Both hyaluronan and hyaluronidase are indicators of very early liver damage in the dimethylnitrosamine-treated rat, occurring well before conventional indicators appear, or before overt histopathologic changes of liver damage can be seen. However, levels are increased only transiently, indicating that serial assays are necessary.
Measures of circulating hyaluronidase activity may be used to assess liver damage.
