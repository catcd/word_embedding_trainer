The authors administered 400 to 1600 mg of monosodium glutamate and placebo to five healthy males while they were medication-free and again while they were receiving the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine, after having received the drug daily for at least 2 weeks. Monosodium glutamate produced no consistent changes in either blood pressure or heart rate in subjects receiving tranylcypromine. Spontaneous hypertensive episodes were observed in two subjects. These blood pressure increases also occurred with tranylcypromine alone and were unrelated to monosodium glutamate administration. Diet was not violated during these episodes.
Vangl2 forms part of the planar cell polarity signalling pathway and is the gene defective in the Looptail (Lp) mouse mutant. Two previously described alleles, Lp and Lp(m1Jus) , segregate in a semi-dominant fashion, with heterozygotes displaying the looped-tail appearance, while homozygotes show the neural tube defect called craniorachischisis. Here, we report a novel experimentally induced allele, Lp(m2Jus) , that carries a missense mutation, R259L, in Vangl2. This mutation was specific to the Lp phenotype and absent from both parental strains and 28 other inbred strains. Notably, this mutation segregates in a recessive manner with all heterozygotes appearing normal and 47% of homozygotes showing a looped-tail. Homozygous Lp(m2Jus) embryos showed spina bifida in 12%. Lp(m2Jus) genetically interacts with Lp with 77% of compound heterozygotes displaying craniorachischisis. Vangl2(R259L) behaved like the wild-type allele in overexpression and morpholino knockdown/rescue assays in zebrafish embryos. These data suggest that Lp(m2Jus) represents a new hypomorphic allele of Lp.
Acute cutaneous neurogenic inflammation initiated by activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors following intradermal injection of capsaicin is mediated mainly by dorsal root reflexes (DRRs). Inflammatory neuropeptides are suggested to be released from primary afferent nociceptors participating in inflammation. However, no direct evidence demonstrates that the release of inflammatory substances is due to the triggering of DRRs and how activation of TRPV1 receptors initiates neurogenic inflammation via triggering DRRs.
Here we used pharmacological manipulations to analyze the roles of TRPV1 and neuropeptidergic receptors in the DRR-mediated neurogenic inflammation induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin. The degree of cutaneous inflammation in the hindpaw that followed capsaicin injection was assessed by measurements of local blood flow (vasodilation) and paw-thickness (edema) of the foot skin in anesthetized rats. Local injection of capsaicin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or substance P (SP) resulted in cutaneous vasodilation and edema. Removal of DRRs by either spinal dorsal rhizotomy or intrathecal administration of the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, reduced dramatically the capsaicin-induced vasodilation and edema. In contrast, CGRP- or SP-induced inflammation was not significantly affected after DRR removal. Dose-response analysis of the antagonistic effect of the TRPV1 receptor antagonist, capsazepine administered peripherally, shows that the capsaicin-evoked inflammation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, and nearly completely abolished by capsazepine at doses between 30-150 mug. In contrast, pretreatment of the periphery with different doses of CGRP8-37 (a CGRP receptor antagonist) or spantide I (a neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist) only reduced the inflammation. If both CGRP and NK1 receptors were blocked by co-administration of CGRP8-37 and spantide I, a stronger reduction in the capsaicin-initiated inflammation was produced.
Our data suggest that 1) the generation of DRRs is critical for driving the release of neuropeptides antidromically from primary afferent nociceptors; 2) activation of TRPV1 receptors in primary afferent nociceptors following intradermal capsaicin injection initiates this process; 3) the released CGRP and SP participate in neurogenic inflammation.
To determine the risk of prostate cancer associated with farming by duration, recency and specific activities among African-Americans and Caucasians.
This population-based case-control study had information on farming-related activities for 405 incident prostate cancer cases and 392 controls matched for age, race and region in South Carolina, USA, from 1999 to 2001. Cases with histologically confirmed, primary invasive prostate cancer who were aged between 65 and 79 years were ascertained through the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry. Appropriately matched controls were identified from the Health Care Financing Administration Medicare Beneficiary File. Data were collected using computer-assisted telephone interviewing, and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression.
Farming was associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in Caucasians (aOR 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 2.7) but not in African-Americans (aOR 1.0; 95% CI 0.6 to 1.6). Regarding specific farming activities, farmers who mixed or applied pesticides had a higher risk of prostate cancer (aOR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.2). Increased risk of prostate cancer was observed only for those farming <5 years.
Increased risk of prostate cancer for farmers in this study may be attributable to pesticide exposure. Racial differences in the association between farming and prostate cancer may be explained by different farming activities or different gene-environment interactions by race.
In man, chloramphenicol (CAP), induces two major haemotoxic effects. First, a reversible, dose-related reticulocytopenia and anaemia developing during treatment. Second, a non-dose-related aplastic anaemia (AA), developing weeks after treatment, is often irreversible and fatal. In previous studies, we developed a mouse model of the reversible reticulocytopenia/anaemia using CAP succinate (CAPS); attempts to induce AA in the mouse with CAPS were unsuccessful; in the rat, CAPS induced only minimal haemotoxicity. We therefore wished to investigate haematological changes caused by CAPS in a third rodent, particularly in relation to the induction of significant 'late stage' bone marrow depression (AA). Female guinea pigs were gavaged with CAPS in three experiments. In a dose ranging study, CAPS (at 2500 and 3500 mg/kg) was administered daily for 9 days, and blood examined at 1 day post dosing. CAPS induced increased erythrocyte values (an apparent haemoconcentration effect), and reduced reticulocytes and femoral marrow nucleated cell counts (FNCC). In a second experiment, CAPS was given at 333, 666 and 1000 mg/kg (13 days); haematological changes were compared with results from the initial study, with evidence of dose-related effects. In a final experiment, CAPS was administered (825 mg/kg, 16 days) and blood studied at 1, 12, 28 and 63 days post dosing. At day 1, erythrocyte values were decreased (NS), and reticulocytes and FNCC were reduced; the marrow was hypocellular with erythroid depletion. At 12 and 28 days, values returned towards the normal range. At 63 days, parameters were normal. Thus, CAPS (825 mg/kg for 16 days) induced changes comparable to the reversible bone marrow depression seen in man; but there was no evidence of 'late stage' (i.e. at 63 days) marrow depression, as would be seen in a developing or overt marrow aplasia (AA). The guinea pig (like the mouse) is a model for the early events, but is not a good model for CAP-induced AA in man.
Therapeutic equivalency among different drug products is one of the major issues confronting many clinicians today who are functioning as members of pharmacy and therapeutic committees and state Medicaid programs (SMP). Selection of one of the available slow-release potassium chloride formulations for inclusion in a hospital formulary or SMP exemplifies one of these therapeutic equivalency issues. To evaluate this issue, we studied 20 hypertensive adult patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/d to determine if there are significant differences between the administration of 24 mEq of Slow-K given as 8 mEq/tablet tid, and 30 mEq of K-Tab given as a 10 mEq/tablet tid. The study was conducted in a randomized, open-label, crossover design in which the two drug formulations of potassium chloride were compared over two four-week treatment periods. Results from this study indicate that 24 mEq of Slow-K and 30 mEq of K-Tab were equally effective in maintaining serum electrolyte concentrations, blood pressure measurements, and electrocardiogram evaluations within normal limits in all 20 hypertensive patients studied. Furthermore, no adverse effects were noted with either potassium chloride formulation, and patient acceptance, tolerability, and compliance to prescribed dosing regimens were similar for both products. Based on our findings, therefore, we conclude that 24 mEq of Slow-K and 30 mEq of K-Tab given three times daily as 8 mEq and 10 mEq tablets, respectively, are therapeutically equivalent.
Cyclophosphamide (CPM) has been considered to be a factor of bladder carcinogen. A 60-years old woman had been received a total dose of 370 g of CPM for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis since August, 1977. She was consulted to our department with chief complaint of macrohematuria in August, 1986. Hemorrhage cystitis was diagnosed and cystoscopy and urine cytology were performed as follow-up schedule in every year. In 1996, urine cytology showed class IV and cystoscopy revealed multiple nonpapillary tumors. Abdominal computerized tomography demonstrated a low density mass on the posterior wall of the bladder. A transurethral cold cup biopsy showed G3 transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Radical cystectomy and tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy was performed on December 6, 1996 and histopathological diagnosis was TCC, G 3, pT3 bNXM0. She died of liver failure due to metastatic bladder cancer after seven months postoperatively.
To estimate long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollutants on an individual basis and to assess adverse health effects using a combination of air pollution measurement data, data from geographical information systems (GIS) and questionnaire data.
40 measurement sites in the city of Munich, Germany were selected at which to collect particulate matter with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 microm (PM2.5) and to measure PM2.5 absorbance and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). A pool of GIS variables (information about street length, household and population density and land use) was collected for the Munich metropolitan area and was used in multiple linear regression models to predict traffic-related air pollutants. These models were also applied to the birth addresses of two birth cohorts (German Infant Nutritional Intervention Study (GINI) and Influence of Life-style factors on the development of the Immune System and Allergies in East and West Germany (LISA)) in the Munich metropolitan area. Associations between air pollution concentrations at birth address and 1-year and 2-year incidences of respiratory symptoms were analysed.
The following means for the estimated exposures to PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance and NO2 were obtained: 12.8 microg/m3, 1.7x10(-5) m(-1) and 35.3 mug/m3, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for wheezing, cough without infection, dry cough at night, bronchial asthma, bronchitis and respiratory infections indicated positive associations with traffic-related air pollutants. After controlling for individual confounders, significant associations were found between the pollutant PM2.5 and sneezing, runny/stuffed nose during the first year of life (OR 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.34) Similar effects were observed for the second year of life. These findings are similar to those from our previous analysis that were restricted to a subcohort in Munich city. The extended study also showed significant effects for sneezing, running/stuffed nose. Additionally, significant associations were found between NO2 and dry cough at night (or bronchitis) during the first year of life. The variable "living close to major roads" (<50 m), which was not analysed for the previous inner city cohort with birth addresses in the city of Munich, turned out to increase the risk of wheezing and asthmatic/spastic/obstructive bronchitis.
Effects on asthma and hay fever are subject to confirmation at older ages, when these outcomes can be more validly assessed.
A 25 year-old woman diagnosed as acute myelocytic leukemia (M0) suffered a fourth relapse in February 1992 at which time she already had anthracycline-induced cardiac dysfunction. Although remission was induced by low dose cytosine arabinoside and etoposide combined with pirarubicin, she developed acute heart failure followed by extreme elevation of transaminases level and DIC. Abdominal echography and CT revealed small round lesions in the liver. We diagnosed this episode as ischemic hepatitis because of the following clinical findings; serological markers of virus hepatitis were negative, hypotension and reduced blood flow to the liver were seen, and both transaminases and LDH were markedly elevated. Dobutamin and oxygen inhalation were started, her liver function returned to almost normal levels 8 days later.
We investigated the hyperalgesic (antianalgesic) effect of the inhaled anesthetics isoflurane, halothane, nitrous oxide, and diethyl ether, or the nonimmobilizer 1, 2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane at subanesthetic partial pressures (or, for the nonimmobilizer, subanesthetic partial pressures predicted from lipid solubility) in rats. Hyperalgesia was assessed as a decrease in the time to withdrawal of a rat hind paw exposed to heat. All four anesthetics, including nitrous oxide and diethyl ether, produced hyperalgesia at low partial pressures, with a maximal effect at 0.1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) required to prevent response to movement in 50% of animals, and analgesia (an increased time to withdrawal of the hind paw) at 0. 4 to 0.8 MAC. The nonimmobilizer had neither analgesic nor hyperalgesia effects. We propose that inhaled anesthetics with a higher MAC-Awake (the MAC-fraction that suppresses appropriate responsiveness to command), such as nitrous oxide and diethyl ether, can be used as analgesics because patients are conscious at higher anesthetic partial pressures, including those which have analgesic effects, whereas anesthetics with a lower MAC-Awake do not produce analgesic effects at concentrations that permit consciousness.
The inhaled anesthetics isoflurane, halothane, nitrous oxide, and diethyl ether produce antianalgesia at subanesthetic concentrations, with a maximal effect at approximately one-tenth the concentration required for anesthesia. This effect may enhance perception of pain when such small concentrations are reached during recovery from anesthesia.
Dandruff is a chronic scalp disorder characterized by scaling and itching. A successful anti-dandruff shampoo not only has to provide superior anti-dandruff relief to ensure patient compliance. It also needs to offer excellent cosmetic and hair conditioning benefits at the same time. In this study, the efficacy of a shampoo containing 0.5% piroctone olamine and 0.45% climbazole (shampoo 1) was compared with a widely available commercial shampoo containing 1% zinc pyrithione (shampoo 2). In vitro studies investigating the anti-mycotic efficacy of a combination of 0.5% piroctone olamine and 0.45% climbazole as well as 1% zinc pyrithione were performed. To study substantivity, pig skin punches were used as a model system and a test of wet combability was performed to characterize combing ease. In vivo home-in-use studies were carried out to determine the efficacy of both shampoos to improve scalp condition and reduce itching in subjects suffering from moderate to severe dandruff. Results demonstrated a comparable anti-fungal effectiveness for 0.5% piroctone olamine plus 0.45% climbazole and 1% zinc pyrithione, respectively. Shampoo 1 showed a significantly higher anti-mycotics substantivity compared to shampoo 2. After treatment with shampoo 1, the wet combing force was significantly reduced compared with shampoo 2, suggesting a better combability following the use of shampoo 1. In an in vivo split head design study, shampoo 1 was shown to be equally effective in reducing the amount of dandruff on the scalp compared with shampoo 2. The approval rate of volunteers regarding the question 'The use of this shampoo decreases the itching of my scalp?' after a 4-week treatment with shampoo 1 equaled 90%. Overall, the shampoo formulation with 0.5% piroctone olamine and 0.45% climbazole effectively reduces the amount of dandruff and, at the same time, provides hair conditioning advantages.
The opioid benzodiazepine, tifluadom, and the benzodiazepine tranquilizer, diazepam, were compared for their influence on morphine and scopolamine-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. Diazepam enhanced drug-induced hyperactivity, while tifluadom had no effect or reduced locomotor activity. The results demonstrate that tifluadom, a benzodiazepine compound possessing opiate-like analgesic properties, is devoid of either benzodiazepine or morphine-like effects in activity tests.
It remains unclear if inflammation itself may induce cancer, if inflammation is a result of tumor growth, or a combination of both exists. The aim of this study was to examine whether C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and CRP gene variations were associated with an altered risk of colorectal, lung, breast, or prostate cancer.
A total of 7,017 participants age > or = 55 years from the Rotterdam Study were eligible for analyses. Mean follow-up time was 10.2 years. High-sensitivity CRP measurements were performed to identify additional values of 0.2 to 1.0 mg/L compared with standard procedures. Genotypes of the CRP gene were determined with an allelic discrimination assay.
High levels (> 3 mg/L) of CRP were associated with an increased risk of incident cancer (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.7) compared with persons with low levels (< 1 mg/L), even after a potential latent period of 5 years was introduced. Although CRP seems to affect several cancer sites, the association was strongest for lung cancer (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6 to 4.9). A CRP single nucleotide polymorphism associated with decreased CRP levels was associated with an increased lung cancer risk of 2.6 (95% CI, 1.6 to 4.4) in homozygous carriers.
Baseline CRP levels seem to be a biomarker of chronic inflammation preceding lung cancer, even after subtracting a 5-year latent period. Furthermore, CRP gene variation associated with low CRP blood levels was relatively common in patients with lung cancer. Both chronic inflammation and impaired defense mechanisms resulting in chronic inflammation might explain these results.
Inhibition of bile salt transport across the hepatocyte during cholestasis induced by cyclosporin A has been shown. However, the contribution of the different bile salt transport systems in liver to cholestasis has remained controversial.
The sensitivity of different bile salt transport systems in liver to cyclosporin-induced inhibition was determined by transport assays in plasma membrane vesicles and by in vivo studies in the rat.
Cyclosporin A--induced inhibition of sodium-dependent uptake of bile salts across the sinusoidal membrane, of potential-dependent, and of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent bile salt transport across the canalicular membrane exhibited inhibition constants (Ki) of 5, 70, and 0.2 mumol/L, respectively. The nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporin analogue PSC 833 also preferentially inhibited the ATP-dependent bile salt transport with an inhibition constant of 0.6 mumol/L. Cyclosporin A and its analogue PSC 833 [(3'-oxo-4-butenyl-4-methyl-Thr1)-(Val2)-cyclosporin] (25 mg/kg each) served as tools to interfere with [14C]taurocholate secretion into bile in vivo, causing an accumulation of [14C]-taurocholate in liver and reducing bile flow to 50%. In mutant rats deficient in the transport of leukotriene C4 and related conjugates across the canalicular membrane, bile flow was reduced to 14%.
The cyclosporins preferentially inhibit the ATP-dependent bile salt export carrier in the canalicular membrane. This inhibition reduces bile salt-dependent bile flow and causes intrahepatic cholestasis.
In the chick embryo, administration of the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) after 60 h incubation induces the ventral body wall defect (VBW) with similarities to the human omphalocele. Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) I and ROCK-II mediate signalling from Rho to the actin cytoskeleton in the Wnt non-canonical pathway. ROCK-I knockout (KO), ROCK-II KO, and ROCK-I/ROCK-II double heterozygous mice have been shown to cause failure of closure of the VBW. The exact mechanism by which Cd acts in the Wnt signalling pathway still remains unclear. We designed this study to test the hypothesis, that the gene expression levels of ROCK-I and ROCK-II are downregulated during the critical period of embryogenesis in the Cd-induced VBW defect chick model.
Chick embryos were harvested 1 h (1H), 4 h (4H), and 8 h (8H) after treatment of cadmium and divided into two groups: control (n = 8 at each time point), and Cd (n = 8 at each time point). Real-time RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the relative mRNA levels of ROCK-I and ROCK-II expression in the Cd-induced VBW defect chick model. Differences between the two groups at each time point were tested by using Mann-Whitney's U test and statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.
The relative mRNA levels of ROCK-I and ROCK-II at 4H were significantly decreased in Cd group compared to controls (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). The expression levels of ROCK-I and ROCK-II at 1H and 8H were not significantly different between Cd group and controls.
Our results provide evidence, for the first time, that the gene expression levels of ROCK-I and ROCK-II are significantly downregulated at 4 h after treatment of Cd in the VBW defect model of chick embryo. We speculate that the downregulation of ROCK-I and ROCK-II gene expressions during this narrow window of embryogenesis may cause VBW defect by disrupting Wnt non-canonical pathway.
High amplitude spiking representative of seizures, accompanied by an unusual motor behavior pattern of rearing and forelimbic clonus resembling "boxing," was elicited by microinjection of the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, 4 micrograms, into the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat. A rating scale devised to score the behavior revealed a motor pattern elicited by carbachol from the medial anterior cortex which was similar to that described by Racine for electrical stimulation of the amygdala. Topographical analysis of the areas surrounding the medial anterior cortex region revealed that the motor manifestations of seizures were elicited over a wide region of the anterior cortex, with scores significantly lower at carbachol microinjection sites greater than 1 mm rostral, 2 and 3 mm caudal, and 2 mm lateral to the standard medial prefrontal cortex site. Unilateral microinjection of carbachol yielded motor seizures primarily from the contralateral forepaw, suggesting involvement of a crossed pathway. Retrograde tracing with fast blue dye, combined with immunostaining for choline acetyltransferase and NADPH-diaphorase, found that the cholinergic neurons innervating the standard microinjection site were the dorsolateral tegmental cells, as previously reported, which have been shown to also contain substance P and corticotropin releasing factor. In addition, cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert region were found to innervate the standard microinjection site. These findings implicate cholinergic innervation of the rostral cortex in classical limbic seizures.
Atracurium is sometimes used for muscle relaxation in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Use of atracurium in high doses or for a long period of time has raised the possibility of the accumulation of laudanosine, a breakdown product known to cause seizure activity in animals. The objective of this report was to see if laudanosine accumulation and seizure activity had occurred in a patient who had received a long-term, relatively high-dose infusion of atracurium.
Case report. The patient received atracurium for 38 days, at rates ranging from 0.3 to 0.96 mg/kg/hr. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was done before the discontinuation of the infusion, and plasma concentrations of atracurium and laudanosine were measured at, and after, the termination of the atracurium infusion. The laudanosine elimination half-life was calculated.
Intensive care unit.
A 23-yr-old woman admitted with sickle cell crisis, complicated by acute chest syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and hepatic and renal failure.
None.
As expected, laudanosine concentrations were increased but were below the level reported to cause seizure activity in animals. Laudanosine elimination half-life was prolonged to 617 mins, which was consistent with previously reported values. The patient's EEG was normal, with no ictal pattern.
Despite long-term use of high doses of atracurium infusion and the increased elimination half-life of laudanosine, only moderate accumulation of laudanosine occurred, and the EEG was normal. Hence, it appears unlikely that toxic concentrations of laudanosine would be reached, even in a critically ill patient.
We report a case of intractable cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Conservative therapy, including suprapubic cystostomy with through-and-through bladder irrigation, failed to slow the bleeding. We then instilled 200 cc of a 0.7 mg. per cent solution of prostaglandin F2-alpha into the bladder for 4 hours daily. The bleeding ceased completely by the end of treatment 5 and the patient remains free of hematuria. There were no side effects noted during the 5 days of treatment. This form of therapy offers an effective, safe and easy alternative to more caustic bladder irrigants and methods of treatment.
Circulating prolactin levels were monitored in nonarteriosclerotic, arteriosclerotic, and hormonally sterilized male and female Sprague-Dawley rats during the acute necrosis and repair phases of myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol. Male rats are particularly prone to succumb to acute myocardial ischemia but reduction of androgen levels by neonatal sterilization improved survival considerably. Circulating prolactin levels are greatly increased, particularly in females, during acute myocardial ischemia. Since androgens suppress the hypothalamic center for prolactin release, prolactin levels were delayed and transitory in males. It is suggested that the superior survival of female rats may be related to their greater production of prolactin during acute stages of myocardial ischemia, which would dampen the tachycardia-inducing effects of the potent beta-adrenergic stimulating agent, isoproterenol.
Tamoxifen induced hepatotoxicity has not been investigated in breast cancer patients with pre-existing liver steatosis. The aim of our study was to investigate the most common predisposing factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in breast cancer patients with liver steatosis, treated with adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, in order to evaluate their role in the appearance of tamoxifen induced hepatotoxicity.
Clinical and laboratory evaluation, including an oral glucose tolerance test, was done in 60 women with breast cancer and liver steatosis before the beginning of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment and every 6 months during treatment. Tamoxifen induced hepatotoxicity was defined as abnormal liver function tests during tamoxifen treatment whereas these test results were below the normal range at baseline control. Statistical evaluation of data was performed using parametric methodology (the chi-squared test, and Student's t-test, P < 0.05).
Twenty-six patients (43.3%) exhibited tamoxifen induced hepatotoxicity (group A) whereas 34 (56.7%) did not (group B). The mean overall follow-up period for the whole group was 37.5 months (SD 27.8, range 6-120 months) and did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.055). There was significant statistical difference in body mass index (BMI) and baseline fasting glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels between the two groups. Eighteen of 26 patients (69.2%) from group A had impaired glucose tolerance compared with only 8/34 patients (23.5%) from group B (P < 0.001), a finding observed even in BMI matched patients from the two groups (62.5% vs 12.5%, P = 0.002).
Tamoxifen induced hepatotoxicity is observed in a great proportion of breast cancer patients with pre-existing liver steatosis, especially those with higher BMI and higher glucose and lipid levels at baseline control. Glucose intolerance before the beginning of tamoxifen treatment seems to be a predictor of the hepatotoxicity, unrelated to baseline BMI.
The clinical significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) core-related antigen (HBcrAg) in predicting the reactivation of hepatitis after halting lamivudine administration was analyzed.
A total of 34 patients with chronic hepatitis B were enrolled. Lamivudine was administered for at least 6 months before cessation, and reactivation of hepatitis was defined as elevation of alanine aminotransferase levels to more than 80 IU/L within 12 months of cessation.
In total, 20 (59%) patients experienced hepatitis reactivation. Although concentrations of HBV DNA and HBcrAg in serum did not differ between the two groups of patients at the onset of lamivudine administration, HBcrAg serum levels were significantly higher (P = 0.009) in the reactivation patients (median 4.9, 25-75% range 4.7- 5.9 log unit/mL) than the non-reactivation patients (median 3.2, 25-75% range <3.0-4.5 log unit/mL) post-lamivudine treatment. The concentration of HBV DNA did not differ between the two groups (median <3.7, 25-75% range <3.7-<3.7 log copy/mL in the reactivation group vs. median <3.7, 25-75% range <3.7-<3.7 log copy/mL in the non- reactivation group). Receiver operating characteristic analysis of HBcrAg concentration showed an area under the curve of 0.764 in predicting patients without reactivation of hepatitis.
HBcrAg can be a useful marker to identify patients who are not at risk of reactivation of severe hepatitis after discontinuation of lamivudine administration.
Bilateral ankle skin ulcers developed in a 61-year-old man in the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia receiving hydroxyurea therapy. The circulating immune complex (anti-C3d antibody) was high in this case, but vasculitis was not observed in the pathological findings of biopsied skin materials. This association has been reported in patients who had chronic myelogenous leukemia or other myeloproliferative disorders and were treated with hydroxyurea. It is likely that skin ulcers are caused by hydroxyurea.
Acute and chronic administration of vigabatrin, a selective inactivator of GABA-T, suppresses haloperidol-induced dyskinesias at low doses without preventing the enhancement of striatal dopamine D2 receptor density or the development of vacuous chewing movements. The long-term administration of vigabatrin does not attenuate its effect. The observations presented in this work support the GABA hypothesis of haloperidol-induced vacuous chewing behavior in rats, and suggest that vigabatrin is an appropriate means to enhance nigral GABAergic activity.
Afatinib (BIBW 2992), a novel aniline-quinazoline derivative, irreversibly and equipotently targets the intrinsic kinase activity of all active ErbB receptor family members. Preclinical results show that afatinib is effective in lung cancer models, including those with EGF receptor (EGFR) mutations resistant to reversible first-generation EGFR inhibitors. Afatinib is being investigated in the LUX-Lung program, which will evaluate afatinib as a first-line treatment in patients with EGFR-activating mutations (LUX-Lung 2, 3 and 6) and as a second- or third-line treatment in patients that have acquired resistance to gefitinib and/or erlotinib (LUX-Lung 1, 4 and 5). LUX-Lung 1 and 2 have demonstrated, within their respective target groups, a significant increase in the disease control rate of 58 and 86%, respectively, and significant prolongation of progression-free survival. Further Phase III clinical trials are currently ongoing to assess afatinib in combination with paclitaxel (LUX-Lung 5), and compared with cisplatin/pemetrexed (LUX-Lung 3) or cisplatin/gemcitabine (LUX-Lung 6).
Hormone manipulation has been standard therapy for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate for many years. Recently cytotoxic drugs have been studied, but their effectiveness has been limited, indicating the need for new therapeutic approaches. Based upon the hypothesis that cytotoxic drugs are most effective against actively proliferating cells, we have designed a clinical pilot study employing cyclical androgen priming to transiently stimulate tumor cells followed by cytotoxic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate. There were nine responders (43%) out of 21 patients entered in the study, with a median duration of response that has not been reached at 9+ months. Survival was significantly better in responders than in non-responding patients. These results are similar to those of other studies in which chemotherapy was used alone. Chemotherapy toxicity with this schedule was mild. However, the androgen priming frequently resulted in increased bone pain, and there was one episode of spinal cord compression, suggesting that tumor stimulation was achieved. These results demonstrate the need for additional basic studies of the effects of testosterone on tumor cell kinetics before further clinical trials of this approach are initiated.
