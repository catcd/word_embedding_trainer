A 12 year old patient with the Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome and suffering from acute intestinal obstruction during treatment with benztropine is presented. An upright film of the abdomen and opacification of the duodenum showed an abrupt cut off just to the right of the third lumbar vertebra. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a reduced superior mesenteric-aortic angle and distance. Predisposing factors in this patient were supine position, extreme opisthotonos and duodenal hypotonia induced by benztropine.
In 203 patients with clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease, cardiac and extracardiac side effects of the dipyridamole test were investigated. Following dipyridamole (0.75 mg/kg body wt. i.v.), heart rate increased significantly, whereas arterial blood pressure remained almost constant. Dyspnea was noted in 80 cases (40.5%). In 48 patients (23.6%) rhythm disturbances were recorded; 58.1% suffered from extracardiac side effects such as congestion in the head, vertigo, heaviness of arms and legs, sensations of heat, upper abdominal pain, and nausea. A detailed report is given of 4 cases with extraordinary symptoms during or after the injection of dipyridamole. A life-threatening status anginosus with dyspnea, ST-segment elevation, and cardiac arrhythmia was observed in one of these cases. High-dose dipyridamole cannot be considered to be harmless. The test should not be performed without continuous ECG monitoring and other safety measures.
A young male nephrotic patient, who was given small doses of clofibrate for hyperlipaemia, developed muscle pain, stiffness and very high serum levels of muscle enzymes. The myopathy remitted completely after administration of clofibrate was stopped. He also displayed a transient mononeuropathy and rapid deterioration of previously stable renal function, so that he required maintenance dialysis. Clofibrate has particular dangers in patients with uraemia or hypoproteinaemia, and we recommend that it be used with great caution in patients with renal disease.
Chronic exposure to carbon disulfide (CS₂) can induce polyneuropathy in occupational worker and experimental animals, but underlying mechanism for CS₂ neuropathy is currently unknown. In the present study, male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups and one control group. The rats in experimental groups were treated with CS₂ by gavage at dosages of 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg/day respectively, six times per week for 6 weeks. The formation of autophagosomes and lysosomes in motor neurons of rat spinal cord was observed by transmission electron microscopy, the level of autophagy-related proteins, lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1), and cathepsin B in spinal cord tissues was determined by Western blot analysis, and the activity of cathepsin B was measured by fluorescence assay. The results demonstrated that the number of lysosomes in motor neurons was markedly increased in CS₂-treated rats. In the meantime, the administration of CS₂ significantly increased the level of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II), Atg1, UVRAG and LAMP-1 in rat spinal cord. Furthermore, the content and activity of cathepsin B in rat spinal cord also showed a significant elevation. Taken together, this study suggested that CS₂ intoxication was associated with the activation of lysosomal degradative machinery, which might play a protective role against CS₂-induced neuronal damage.
After individual determination of neuroleptic threshold (NT) doses of haloperidol, 106 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (Research Diagnostic Criteria) were treated openly at such doses (mean, 3.7 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for 2 weeks. Ten responding patients were discharged and unavailable for follow-up or refused subsequent randomization, and one non-responding patient refused randomization. The remaining 95 responding or nonresponding patients were then randomly assigned, double-blind, to a dosage of haloperidol two to 10 times higher (mean, 11.6 +/- 4.7 mg/d) or to a continuing NT dosage (mean, 3.4 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for another 2 weeks. Of the 58 patients exposed only to NT dosages of haloperidol, 72% clinically recovered within the 5-week trial. Higher dosages given to 47 patients did not lead to greater improvement in measures of psychosis, but did produce slightly greater declines in measures of hostility. Higher dosages did regularly lead to significant increases in distressing extrapyramidal side effects.
Intraventricular (IVT) administration of digoxin (7.5 micrograms) induced 'popcorn-type' convulsions in rats. Though the convulsions looked similar to morphine-induced seizures, naloxone failed to antagonize these effects. Other anticonvulsants like phenobarbitone, ethosuximide, or GABAergic substances like piracetam and semicarbazide also had no protective effect against digoxin-induced convulsions. While calcium chloride potentiated these effects of digoxin, phenytoin, magnesium chloride, and potassium chloride treatment showed blocking actions. These observations suggest the involvement of Na/K-ATPase system in digoxin-induced convulsions. Clonidine and diazepam also provided protection against digoxin-induced convulsions through an unknown mechanism.
Rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model which has a high analogy to clinical liver cancer is of great value in understanding the pathogenesis and evolution of liver cancer, in searching effective anti-cancer treatments (drug, hepatectomy and liver transplantation), and designing cancer prevention strategies. In this study we established a modified rat model of hepatocellular carcinoma to enhance rats' physique and surgical endurance.
Wistar rats were fed with diethylnitrosamine (DENA) by three methods for evaluation of general conditions for 130 days: Doppler ultrasonographic measurement, laparotomy and histopathological examination.
No rat died in control group (group A) and modified DENA-induction-HCC group(group C), but 6 deaths in classical DENA-induction-HCC group (group B) (survival rate 80%). All survived rats in groups B and C developed diffusive hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis. General appearance of rats in the group C was better than that in the group B.
With good general conditions for surgery, the modified rat model for hepatocellular carcinoma has a high carcinogenic rate and a high survival rate.
Current therapy-regimens against Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infections have considerable failure rates and adverse side effects that urge the quest for an effective alternative therapy. We have shown that curcumin is capable of eradicating Hp-infection in mice. Here we examine the mechanism by which curcumin protects Hp infection in cultured cells and mice. Since, MMP-3 and -9 are inflammatory molecules associated to the pathogenesis of Hp-infection, we investigated the role of curcumin on inflammatory MMPs as well as proinflammatory molecules. Curcumin dose dependently suppressed MMP-3 and -9 expression in Hp infected human gastric epithelial (AGS) cells. Consistently, Hp-eradication by curcumin-therapy involved significant downregulation of MMP-3 and -9 activities and expression in both cytotoxic associated gene (cag)(+ve) and cag(-ve) Hp-infected mouse gastric tissues. Moreover, we demonstrate that the conventional triple therapy (TT) alleviated MMP-3 and -9 activities less efficiently than curcumin and curcumin's action on MMPs was linked to decreased pro-inflammatory molecules and activator protein-1 activation in Hp-infected gastric tissues. Although both curcumin and TT were associated with MMP-3 and -9 downregulation during Hp-eradication, but unlike TT, curcumin enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and inhibitor of kappa B-α. These data indicate that curcumin-mediated healing of Hp-infection involves regulation of MMP-3 and -9 activities.
This study investigated the effects of fucoxanthin isolated from marine plant extracts on lipid metabolism and blood glucose concentration in high-fat diet fed C57BL/6N mice. The mice were divided into high-fat control (HFC; 20% fat, w/w), low-fucoxanthin (low-Fxn; HFC+0.05% Fxn, w/w) and high-fucoxanthin (high-Fxn; HFC+0.2% Fxn, w/w) groups. Fxn supplementation significantly lowered the concentration of plasma triglyceride with a concomitant increase of fecal lipids in comparison to the HFC group. Also, the hepatic lipid contents were significantly lowered in the Fxn supplemented groups which seemed to be due to the reduced activity of the hepatic lipogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, fatty acid synthase and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and the enhanced activity of beta-oxidation. Plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and its percentage were markedly elevated by Fxn supplementation. Activities of two key cholesterol regulating enzymes: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase, were significantly suppressed by Fxn regardless of the dosage. Relative mRNA expressions of acyl-coA oxidase 1, palmitoyl (ACOX1) and peroxisome proliferators activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and gamma (PPARgamma) were significantly altered by Fxn supplementation in the liver. Fxn also lowered blood glucose and HbA(1c) levels along with plasma resistin and insulin concentrations. These results suggest that Fxn supplementation plays a beneficial role in not only regulating the plasma and hepatic lipids metabolism but also for blood glucose-lowering action in high-fat fed mice.
Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a disease characterized by failure of the kidney to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin. Human kindreds with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus have been found to harbor mutations in the vasopressin receptor 2 (Avpr2) gene or the vasopressin-sensitive water channel aquaporin-2 (Aqp2) gene. Development of a treatment is rendered difficult due to the lack of a viable animal model. Through forward genetic screening of ethylnitrosourea-mutagenized mice, we report the identification and characterization of a mouse model of NDI, with an F204V mutation in the Aqp2 gene. Unlike previously attempted murine models of NDI, our mice survive to adulthood and more exactly recapitulate the human disorder. Previous in vitro experiments using renal cell lines suggest recessive Aqp2 mutations result in improper trafficking of the mutant water pore. Using these animals, we have directly proven this hypothesis of improper AQP2 translocation as the molecular defect in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in the intact organism. Additionally, using a renal cell line we show that the mutated protein, AQP2-F204V, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and that this abnormal localization can be rescued by wild-type protein. This novel mouse model allows for further mechanistic studies as well as testing of pharmacological and gene therapies for NDI.
Dibucaine is considered one of the most potent and consequently toxic amide anesthetics available, and despite withdrawal from the US market as a spinal anesthetic, it remains accessible as an over-the-counter preparation in the United States. Dibucaine exposures in children are infrequently encountered, but to date, all reported consequential ingestions have resulted in death. We report the first case of a potentially fatal dibucaine-induced wide-complex arrhythmia in a child who survived her clinical course without sequelae. It is our hope that this report will highlight the toxicity of dibucaine and prompt a review of its over-the-counter status. The rationale and success of a new antidote, 20% lipid emulsion, for the management of local anesthetic toxicity is discussed.
A novel series of mGluR2 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), 1-[(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)methyl]-4-phenylpiperidines, is herein disclosed. Structure-activity relationship studies led to potent, selective mGluR2 PAMs with excellent pharmacokinetic profiles. A representative lead compound (+)-17e demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity and mescaline-induced scratching in mice, providing support for potential efficacy in treating psychosis.
The present investigation aimed to elucidate the analgesic efficacy of 30 mg of intravenous orphenadrine citrate (CAS 4682-36-4) in a human pain model. Eighteen healthy female and male subjects were enrolled and received single infusions of 30 mg orphenadrine citrate and matching placebo in two periods which were separated by a 1 week washout period. The study was designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, cross-over trial. The intended neurogenic inflammation and hyperalgesia were induced by topical, occlusive application of 1% capsaicin solution (INCI: Capsicum frutescens, containing capsaicinoides from Capsicum annuum annuum, CAS 84603-55-4) for 30 min on defined skin areas of the back. The pain response to CO2 laser pulses applied to the capsaicin pre-treated skin was measured by event related Vertex-EEG recordings. This technique allowed studying the influence of orphenadrine citrate on the (central) P2-component and the (peripheral) Ni-component of the pain response (LSEP). Both, orphenadrine citrate and placebo were given as intravenous infusions over 60 min. Orphenadrine citrate exerted a significant reduction in central and peripheral components of the pain response when compared to placebo. The effect on the central component was highly significant and more pronounced than the peripheral effect of the drug. The analgesic effect developed fast, was already present during infusion, was ongoing, and exceeded the observational period of 4 h after start of infusion. In summary, orphenadrine citrate was able to exert an analgesic/anti-hyperalgesic effect in a low-dose paradigm (30 mg dose) which was predominantly due to central/spinal mechanisms in this capsaicin model with laser somatosensory evoked potentials.
Medroxyprogesterone (MPA) is a progestin with no clinically detectable estrogenic and androgenic properties used in the treatment of sexual precocity. This report presents the results of administering large intramuscular doses of MPA (200 to 300 mg every 7 to 10 days for periods ranging from 5 to 40 months) in 3 girls and 1 boy with rapidly progressing idiopathic sexual precocity (e.g., breast enlargement, penile enlargement, pubic hair growth). Urinary steroids were measured by bioassay, standard modification of the double isotope derivative method, and other standard methods. The MPA regimen suppressed the signs and symptoms of precocious puberty. The 3 girls did not have further menstrual flow, breast tissue regressed, uterine size decreased, and vaginal cornification diminished, although not to prepubertal levels. A marked decrease in frequency of erections, no further penile enlargement, and only minimal progression of sexual hair were observed in the boy (the testis continued to enlarge, however). Excessive weight gain, rapid rate of linear growth and skeletal maturation were observed in the children during treatment, as was blood pressure elevation. The effectiveness of MPA appears to be mediated by the suppression of pituitary gonadotropin secretion. However, there was no consistent reduction of urinary gonadotropin levels, and suppression of gonadal stimulation was incomplete. Evidence of drug toxicity precludes further administration of high dosages of MPA even for research purposes.
Urotensin-II (U-II) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of U-II causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion. However, the behavioral effects of centrally administered U-II have received little attention. In the present study, we tested the effects of i.c.v. injections of U-II on behavioral, metabolic, and endocrine responses in mice. Administration of graded doses of U-II (1-10,000 ng/mouse) provoked: (1) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole-board test; (2) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black-and-white compartment test, and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus-maze test; and (3) a dose-dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced-swimming test and tail suspension test. Intracerebroventricular injection of U-II also caused an increase in: food intake at doses of 100 and 1,000 ng/mouse, water intake at doses of 100-10,000 ng/mouse, and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10,000 ng/mouse. Whatever was the dose, the central administration of U-II had no effect on body temperature, nociception, apomorphine-induced penile erection and climbing behavior, and stress-induced plasma corticosterone level. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the central injection of U-II at doses of 1-10,000 ng/mouse induces anxiogenic- and depressant-like effects in mouse. These data suggest that U-II may be involved in some aspects of psychiatric disorders.
We have constructed a large-scale transcriptome database of rat liver treated with various drugs. In an effort to identify a biomarker for diagnosis of hepatic phospholipidosis, we extracted 78 probe sets of rat hepatic genes from data of 5 drugs, amiodarone, amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine, and ketoconazole, which actually induced this phenotype. Principal component analysis (PCA) using these probes clearly separated dose- and time-dependent clusters of treated groups from their controls. Moreover, 6 drugs (chloramphenicol, chlorpromazine, gentamicin, perhexiline, promethazine, and tamoxifen), which were reported to cause phospholipidosis but judged as negative by histopathological examination, were designated as positive by PCA using these probe sets. Eight drugs (carbon tetrachloride, coumarin, tetracycline, metformin, hydroxyzine, diltiazem, 2-bromoethylamine, and ethionamide), which showed phospholipidosis-like vacuolar formation in the histopathology, could be distinguished from the typical drugs causing phospholipidosis. Moreover, the possible induction of phospholipidosis was predictable by the expression of these genes 24 h after single administration in some of the drugs. We conclude that these identified 78 probe sets could be useful for diagnosis of phospholipidosis, and that toxicogenomics would be a promising approach for prediction of this type of toxicity.
Candida infections continue to play a significant role not only in critically ill and immunocompromised patients but also in non-compromised patients. The incidence of systemic fungal infections in the United States has been on the rise for the past 30 years. Anidulafungin and all echinocandins inhibit glucan synthase thus inhibiting the formation of 1,3-β-D-glucan which is an essential component of the fungal cell wall. The decrease in 1,3-β-D-glucan results in the osmotic lysis of the cell, resulting in fungicidal activity against candida. Anidulafungin is active against most species of candida and resistance to it is very rare. Two potential mechanisms conferring reduced susceptibility to the echinocandins are efflux and target alteration. The efflux pump associated with fluconazole resistance in Candida albicans can confer higher minimum inhibitory concentrations to caspofungin. The second mechanism of resistance is via mutations in the genes which code for 1,3 β-D-glucan synthase, specifically FKS1. Because of its spectrum of activity, fungicidal nature, and tolerability it is an attractive first-line therapeutic choice for treating candidemia in both non-neutropenic and neutropenic patients. Because it is available only parenterally its role in treating mucocutaneous candidiasis is primarily in patients unable to take oral therapy.
One etiologic model for narcolepsy suggests that some environmental toxin selectively and irreversibly destroys hypocretin-producing cells in individuals with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1(*)0602. Between 2001 and 2005, the authors conducted a population-based case-control study in King County, Washington to examine narcolepsy risk in relation to toxins found in jobs, hobbies, and other non-vocational activities. Sixty-seven cases and 95 controls were enrolled; all were between ages 18 and 50 and positive for HLA DQB1(*)0602. All were administered in-person interviews about jobs, hobbies or other non-vocational activities before age 21. All analyses were adjusted for African-American race and income. Risk increased significantly for jobs involving heavy metals (odds ratio [OR]=4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 14.5) and for highest levels of exposure to woodwork (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.0, 8.9), fertilizer (OR=3.1; 95% CI: 1.1, 9.1), and bug or weed killer (OR=4.5; 95% CI: 1.5, 13.4). Associations were of borderline significance for activities involving ceramics, pesticides, and painting projects. Significant dose-response relationships were evident for jobs involving metals (p<0.03), paints (p<0.03), and bug or weed killer (p<0.02). Additional studies are needed to replicate these findings and continue the search for specific toxins that could damage hypocretin neurons in genetically susceptible people.
The study was performed in order to improve postoperative pain management in children after major orthopaedic surgery. Two different anaesthetic techniques (sevoflurane-low fentanyl and propofol-higher fentanyl) and two different epidural mixtures (bupivacaine 1.5 mg ml(-1) and adrenaline 2 microg ml(-1) compared with bupivacaine 1 mg ml(-1), adrenaline 2 microg ml(-1) and fentanyl 2 microg ml(-1)) were investigated with regard to postoperative analgesia and side effects, primarily postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
Forty-two children were randomised into one of three groups: sevoflurane anaesthesia and epidural solution with fentanyl (SBAF); sevoflurane anaesthesia and epidural solution without fentanyl (SBA); propofol anaesthesia and epidural solution without fentanyl (PBA).
Including fentanyl in the epidural mixture resulted in excellent postoperative analgesia without any need of i.v. opioids. However, 7 out of 16 children were nauseated and needed antiemetic drugs. On average, a 55-75% higher dose of bupivacaine was necessary to assure adequate analgesia when an epidural mixture without fentanyl was used. In addition, significantly more children needed i.v. opioids. Under these conditions there was no significant difference in pain scoring between the groups. There was significantly less nausea and less use of antiemetic drugs in children having epidurals without fentanyl in the sevoflurane groups. The same tendency, although not significant, was observed in the whole material. Sevoflurane anaesthesia resulted in less PONV than propofol anaesthesia, probably due to the higher amount of intravenous fentanyl used with the latter. This difference was not significant due to the small number of children included. Incidence of pruritus related significantly to epidural fentanyl.
A satisfactory postoperative analgesia can be achieved with both epidural mixtures used in the study. Epidural fentanyl results in better analgesia, but significantly more PONV and greater use of antiemetic drugs. Omitting epidural fentanyl results in less PONV, but significantly less profound analgesia and a need for additional treatment with i.v. opioids, in addition to a 55-75% higher epidural bupivacaine infusion. Both epidural treatments result in high and similar patient satisfaction and no serious complications. The study could not show any significant difference between the effect of sevoflurane and propofol anaesthesia on PONV.
Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies were performed to examine the effects of several antiepileptic drugs (AEDS) on absence-like and tonic seizures in the spontaneously epileptic rat (SER: zi(zi), tm/tm,), a double mutant rat, which was obtained by mating the tremor heterozygous animals (tm/ +) with the zitter homozygous animals (zi/zi), and to determine whether the seizures in the SER correspond to human absence and tonic seizures. Spontaneous EEG was continuously recorded from the frontal cortex and hippocampus using implanted electrodes. The SER showed paroxysmal and synchronized 5-7-Hz spike-wave-like complexes in both cortical and hippocampal EEG during the absence-like state, which was characterized by immobility and staring. The animal also exhibited tonic convulsion without external stimulation concomitant with low-voltage fast waves on cortical and hippocampal EEG. In some animals, sporadic low-amplitude spikes appeared in the low-voltage fast waves during tonic convulsion. the absence-like seizures were inhibited by trimethadione (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally, i.p.) and ethosuximide 100 mg/kg i.p.), whereas the tonic convulsion was not affected by these drugs. In contrast, phenytoin (20 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited the tonic seizures without affecting the absence-like seizures. Phenobarbital (10 mg/kg i.p.) and valproate (200 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited both seizures to a similar degree. These results suggest that the SER, with both absence-like and tonic seizures, is a useful model for evaluation of AEDS.
Human steroid 5alpha-reductase type II (hSRD5A2) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) play important roles in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The aim of our study was to establish a novel model to investigate the inhibitory effects of extracts and compounds of Chinese herb medicine on hSRD5A2. The gene, hSRD5A2, was artificially synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector, which was transfected into CHO cells by liposome. Transfected cells were screened through G418 and MTX. The expressed protein of hSRD5A2 by cells was purified and detected by western blotting. A minimum reactive system comprising hSRD5A2 and testosterone (T) as substrate together with NADPH as hydrogen donor was established for screening inhibitors of hSRD5A2. The reaction system was optimized in the concentrations of T, NADPH, and hSRD5A2 and reaction temperature, time, and activity of hSRD5A2 were determined by the production of DHT. Furthermore, we screened some extracts and compounds of Chinese herb medicine using this model. The concentrations of T, NADPH, and hSRD5A2 were 0.02 microM, 0.8 mM, and 0.05 U/microl, respectively, in the model; maximum activity of hSRD5A2 was achieved at 37 degrees C and 60 min reaction, and mangiferin had significant inhibitory effect on the activity of hSRD5A2. The model in this study is convenient and reliable for screening and evaluation of inhibitors of hSRD5A2; mangiferin may be a potential medicine for the treatment of BPH.
Swertia chirata, is a bitter plant, used in the Indian system of medicine (Ayurveda) for various human ailments. Our laboratory was the first to report the chemopreventive effect of this plant. The antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic action of amarogentin rich fraction of S. chirata is now demonstrated on a mouse skin carcinogenesis model. Immunohistochemical localization revealed a reduction in proliferating and increase in apoptotic cells in skin lesion following treatment, also reflected in the expression of molecular markers--Cox-II and caspase-3 proteins. It may be possible to calculate relative risk, relative protection and attributable risk from the action of test agents on proliferation and apoptosis.
Paraquat is a controversial and one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world. Although liver, kidney, heart and CNS are affected, lung damage resulting to pulmonary fibrosis is the usual cause of deaths in the cases with intoxication. The mechanism of paraquat toxicity is not clear but probably includes the induction of lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. Lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), an antihypertensive drug, has beneficial effects on the treatment of fibrosis. The antifibrotic effect of lisinopril has shown to be due to inhibition of synthesis of angiotensin II that causes stimulation of fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis.
Male albino Wistar rats were used in the experiments (weighing 150-300 g). The animals were divided into 5 groups: group I received saline, group II received lisinopril (1 mg/kg; po), group III was given a single i.p. dose of 20 mg/kg paraquat, group IV (treatment group) received lisinopril after single a i.p. dose of 20 mg/kg paraquat, and group V (pre-treatment group) received lisinopril before a single i.p. dose of 20 mg/kg paraquat. After 21 days of treatment, the level of hydroxyproline and the degree of lipid peroxidation were determined in the lung tissue of the animals and the lungs were examined histologically for fibrosis.
Paraquat caused a significant increase in hydroxyproline content and lisinopril significantly decreased the amount hydroxyproline (p<0.001) in the lung tissue of the rats. The histological examination also indicated that lisinopril can effectively protect the paraquat-induced lung fibrosis. The lipid peroxidation levels in the lung were not significantly changed when compared to the control group.
The antifibrotic effect of lisinopril may be due to inhibition of angiotensin II or proline moiety, which is a common structural in all ACEI, drugs.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of eviprostat, a phytotherapeutic drug, on bladder overactivity and inflammation in a cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis rat model.
Female Sprague-Dawley rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of CYP (200 mg/kg) or saline. After the CYP injection, eviprostat (9, 18 or 54 mg/kg per day) or a vehicle was orally given twice each day. Four days after the CYP injection, bladder function was evaluated by cystometrograms under urethane anesthesia. In a separate group, bladder inflammation was compared between the eviprostat- or vehicle-treated animals. Furthermore, the effects of eviprostat on carbachol-induced muscle contraction were evaluated by an in vitro experiment.
The intercontraction interval (ICI) significantly decreased in the CYP-injected rats in comparison to the saline-injected rats. In the CYP-injected group, 18 and 54 mg/kg per day of eviprostat treatment significantly increased the ICI, but did not change the maximum voiding pressure in comparison to the vehicle treatment. In the saline-injected group, no significant changes of any parameters in the cystometrograms were observed between the eviprostat- and vehicle-treated groups. CYP-induced bladder inflammation tended to be lower in the eviprostat-treated group in comparison to the vehicle-treated group. An in vitro experiment revealed that eviprostat failed to inhibit carbachol-induced muscle contraction.
The oral administration of eviprostat suppressed CYP-induced bladder overactivity. The effects of eviprostat on the micturition reflex may be irrespective of antimuscarinic action. The present findings raise the possibility that eviprostat could be an effective treatment for bladder overactivity associated with inflammation.
