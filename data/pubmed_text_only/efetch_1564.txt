Twenty patients have received 21 courses of high-dose cyclophosphamide (6 g/m2 over 4 days), etoposide (1,800 mg/m2 over 3 days), and carboplatin (800 to 1,600 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 96 hours) and autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell rescue. The maximum tolerated dose of this regimen included these doses of cyclophosphamide and etoposide with a total of 1,600 mg/m2 carboplatin. Acute renal failure was the dose-limiting toxicity and, at the maximum tolerated dose, was observed in two patients of 14 evaluable courses. Nonhematologic toxicity was otherwise modest, and the overall response rate was 70% in patients with a wide variety of solid hematologic neoplasms.
A woman who had been taking diphenylhydantoin presented with a classic picture of mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, which has heretofore been reported exclusively in infants and children. The clinical history is presented herein.
Histologic investigations have demonstrated that root canal sealers can induce mild to severe inflammatory alternations. A recently identified tumor necrosis factor family molecule, receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), plays a critical role in the development of osteoclasts that result in bone resorption. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of root canal sealers AH26, Canals, and N2 on the expression of RANKL in human osteoblast cell line U2OS cells. Freshly mixed materials were filled in glass rings (4 mm height and 10 mm in diameter) and eluted in 10 mL of culture medium for 1 day. Subsequently, various dilutions (final dilution: 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8) of these extraction media were prepared for this study. Cytotoxicity was measured by the propidium iodide fluorescence assay. The expression of RANKL was measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that AH26, Canals, and N2 were cytotoxic to U2OS cells in a concentration-dependent manner (P < .05). The exposure of U2OS cells to root canal sealers resulted in the up-regulation of RANKL mRNA and protein expression (P < .05). The expression of RANKL was up-regulated by root canal sealers in the following order: N2 > AH26 > Canals. Taken together, the activation of RANKL might play an important role in the pathogenesis of periapical bone destruction induced by root canal sealers.
Several experimental pain models have been used to measure opioid effects in humans. The aim of the current study was to compare the qualities of five frequently used experimental pain tests to measure opioid effects.
The increase of electrical, heat, and pressure pain tolerance and the decrease of ice-water and ischemic pain perception was determined at baseline and at four different plasma concentrations of alfentanil (n = 7) administered as target controlled infusion or placebo (n = 7). A linear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) was performed to detect drug, placebo, and time effect as well as interindividual and intraindividual variation of effect.
Only the electrical, ice-water, and pressure pain tests are sensitive to assess a concentration-response curve of alfentanil. At a plasma alfentanil concentration of 100 ng/ml, the increase in pain tolerance compared with baseline was 42.0% for electrical pain, 22.2% for pressure pain, and 21.7% for ice-water pain. The slope of the linear concentration-response curve had an interindividual coefficient of variation of 58.3% in electrical pain, 35.6% in pressure pain, and 60.0% in ice-water pain. The residual error including intraindividual variation at an alfentanil concentration of 100 ng/ml was 19.4% for electrical pain, 6.1% for pressure pain, and 13.0% for ice-water pain. Electrical pain was affected by a significant placebo effect, and pressure pain was affected by a significant time effect.
Electrical, pressure, and ice-water pain, but not ischemic and heat pain, provide significant concentration-response curves in the clinically relevant range of 200 ng/ml alfentanil or lower. The power to detect a clinically relevant shift of the curve is similar in the three tests. The appropriate test(s) for pharmacodynamic studies should be chosen according to the investigated drug(s) and the study design.
The patient was a low birth weight infant with a history of renal failure. She was referred to our department 29 days after birth to undergo fundus examination. She experienced renal failure after undergoing a mydriatic test and needed medical treatment. Eyedrops containing phenylephrine were instilled several times and additional drops were also instilled during the fundal examination using an eyelid retractor, therefore the blood concentration of the drug was elevated sufficiently to contract the renal vessels, ultimately inducing renal failure. The present case suggests that since the use of mydriatic eyedrops in low birth weight infants could induce renal failure, the following points should be considered: 1) Mydriatic eyedrops should be used with caution by monitoring mydriasis and avoiding excessive instillation; 2) After instillation, the lacrimal region should be compressed to prevent the flow of mydriatic drops to the nasolacrimal canal; and 3) Vital signs should be monitored to check the onset of any adverse reactions for 12 hours after fundal examination.
A single or repeated administration of morphine in mice produced hyperactivity, conditioned place preference (CPP) and postsynaptic dopamine (DA) receptor supersensitivity. The hyperactivity induced by morphine was evidenced by measuring the enhanced ambulatory activity using a tilting-type ambulometer. CPP effects were evaluated assessing the increased time spent by the mice to morphine and the inhibition of CPP by the decreased time spent by the mice in the white compartment. Postsynaptic DA receptor supersensitivity in mice displaying a morphine-induced CPP was evidenced by the enhanced response in ambulatory activity to the DA agonist, apomorphine (2 mg/kg, s.c.). The intraperitoneal injection of ginseng total saponin (GTS) from the root of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Araliaceae), prior to and during the morphine treatment in mice inhibited morphine-induced hyperactivity and CPP. GTS inhibited the development of postsynaptic DA receptor supersensitivity. A single dose administration of GTS also inhibited apomorphine-induced climbing behavior, showing the antidopaminergic action of GTS at the postsynaptic DA receptor. These results suggest that the development of morphine-induced CPP may be associated with the enhanced DA receptor sensitivity and that GTS inhibition of the morphine-induced hyperactivity and CPP may be closely related with the inhibition of dopaminergic activation induced by morphine.
Obesity and hypertension are closely associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease. An increase in body mass index is commonly associated with an increase in blood pressure and weight reduction is recommended as the principal intervention in the obese hypertensive patient. Sibutramine therapy, as part of a programme of diet and exercise, can help achieve marked weight reduction and improve metabolic and other cardiovascular risk factors. In hypertensive patients, weight loss induced by sibutramine has also been found to reduce blood pressure. Studies have shown that in the obese, well-controlled hypertensive patient, sibutramine is a safe and well-tolerated therapy offering the many clinical benefits associated with weight reduction in this high-risk population.
The capacity of tetanus toxin to enhance motor neuron excitability has suggested its potential use as a therapeutic. Widespread active vaccination against tetanus in all developed countries is considered the major obstacle to clinical use of the toxin. We wished to determine the response to localized intramuscular injection of tetanus toxin in both passively and actively immunized animals as an initial exploration into the possible use of tetanus toxin as a clinical therapeutic. Unvaccinated mice (n=18) underwent intramuscular injection of tetanus toxin into the gastrocnemius muscle (0.2 ng, 1 ng, 5 ng). All animals in the lowest dose group developed only local tetanus of the injected limb of at least 2 weeks duration, while all animals in the higher dose groups also rapidly developed generalized tetanus and were euthanized. Another group of mice (n=20) received anti-tetanus immunoglobulin (20-40 IU) at the time of toxin injection. These animals although dramatically resistant to the toxin developed predominantly local tetanus for over one month at doses of 2.5 microg and 5.0 microg. A third group of mice (n=30) underwent active vaccination with tetanus toxoid to induce protective anti-tetanus immunity and then was challenged with high dose toxin injection (5 ng, 50 ng, 0.5 microg, 1.25 microg, 2.5 microg, or 5 microg). All animals developed local tetanus in the injected limb at a dose of at least 0.5 microg. The severity and duration of local tetanus was generally related to dose, but was more variable in the actively vaccinated group than in the naive or passively immunized animals. Response to the toxin over the first few days was predictive of both the duration and maximal severity of the motor response. Although vaccination dramatically increases resistance to tetanus toxin, by virtue of its extremely high potency, the toxin can produce prolonged localized tetanus even in vaccinated animals with relatively small amounts of protein. These results suggest the possible use of tetanus toxin to enhance local motor activity in a variety of neurologic conditions even in immunized humans. This study in uniformly vaccinated animals also illustrates the potential difficulties in determining an appropriate dose of toxin in a human population with variable degrees of immunity.
Panitumumab is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that is highly selective for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed in 25-77% of colorectal cancers and is often associated with a poor prognosis. Binding of panitumumab to EGFR reduces cell proliferation and mediator production, and induces apoptosis. In a comparative, phase III trial in adult patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, intravenous panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus best supportive care (BSC) improved progression-free survival (PFS) [primary endpoint] and objective tumor response rate to a significantly greater extent than BSC alone. The improvement in PFS produced by panitumumab monotherapy was significantly greater in patients with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS than in those with mutant KRAS (in whom no benefit from panitumumab was observed). Similarly, all patients experiencing a partial response had wild-type KRAS, while stable disease was achieved by more patients with wild-type KRAS than with mutant KRAS. The predictive value of mutant KRAS for a lack of clinical benefit with panitumumab monotherapy was supported by results from an open-label extension of the phase III study and a large phase II study. Although most patients treated with panitumumab experienced at least one adverse event, the incidence of severe adverse events resulting in discontinuation of treatment was relatively low. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were skin-related toxicities, which reflect the mechanism of action of panitumumab.
CX-659S, a newly discovered anti-inflammatory compound, exerts inhibitory effects on chronic contact hypersensitivity responses (CHRs) induced by repeated application with picryl chloride (PC), which is known to mimic many, if not all, events occurring within lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). CX-659S suppresses the expression of mRNA for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 but not that for IFN-gamma, and inhibits serum IgE production in a chronic CHR model. Although topical corticosteroids have been widely utilized in steroid-responsive dermatoses such as AD, their chronic use may be associated with significant side effects. In addition, a rebound phenomenon often occurs after discontinuation of prolonged use of topical corticosteroids, with enhanced production of IgE and Th2 cell cytokines. The purpose of this study was to assess whether CX- 659S inhibits the rebound phenomenon after discontinuation of chronic treatment with prednisolone in a chronic CHR model in mice.
The efficacy of CX-659S as a sequential therapeutic agent after discontinuation of chronic treatment with prednisolone was tested on PC-treated ears of BALB/c mice with chronic CHR. Effects were quantified by measurements of ear thickness, serum IgE and cytokine mRNA expression.
The rebound phenomenon was confirmed after discontinuation of chronic treatment with prednisolone in chronic CHR in mice, i.e. by evidence of flare thickening of the ear, enhanced expression of mRNA for IL-4 and IL-10 and increased serum IgE. Sequentially applied CX-659S suppressed these rebound phenomena with a good cosmetic result.
CX-659S is the first promising compound with inhibitory activity on the rebound phenomenon following withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy without immunosuppression.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-release niacin (niacin ER) either alone or in combination with atorvastatin for the lipid profile modification in the patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and its equivalents.
One hundred and ten patients with CHD and its equivalents with serum total cholesterol (TC) > or = 3.5 mmol/L were randomly assigned into three treatment groups: (1) atorvastatin group (n = 38), receiving atorvastatin 10 mg/d for 8 weeks; (2) niacin ER group (n = 38), given niacin ER 500 mg/d for 4 weeks and then 1000 mg/d for 4 weeks; (3) combination treatment group (n = 34), treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/d) plus niacin ER, with the dose initiating from 500 mg/d, and increasing to 1000 mg/d after 4 weeks, for 8 weeks. The serums lipid profiles and adverse effects were assessed in all the patients before treatment, and 4 and 8 weeks after treatment.
(1) After 8 weeks of treatment, the serum level of triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were reduced by 30% and 16% respectively in the niacin ER group compared with the baseline values (both P < 0.05). After 8 weeks, the TC, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and TG in the atorvastatin group decreased by 19%, 26%, and 17% respectively compared with the baseline values (all P < 0.05). Combination treatment decreased the TC, LDL-C, and TG levels by 28%, 38%, and 39% respectively, and increased the HDL-C level by 23% (all P < 0.05). The improvement in TC and LDL-C achieved by combination treatment was superior to treatment of atorvastatin alone and treatment of niacin ER alone (all P < 0.05). (2) The rate of achieving the LDL-C goal of The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) in the combination therapy group was 73.5%, significantly higher than those of the atorvastatin and niacin groups (47.7% and 42.1% respectively, both P < 0.05). (3) Adverse effect, such as flushing (15.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (23.7%) were found in the niacin ER group, however, no more adverse effects were found in the combination therapy group. There were no serious adverse events in all groups.
Niacin ER has a favorable effect in modulating the blood lipid profile, especially in reducing TG and elevating HDL-C. Combined statin with niacin may produce a more global and effective improvement in lipid blood levels than monotherapy and is generally safe and well tolerable.
In tests conducted with 165 mongrel sexually mature and immature rats it is shown that azathioprine used in nephrotoxic nephritic improves the general condition, reduces the edema of subcutaneous cellular tissues, as well as the intensity of proteinuria and helps retaining its selective type, lessens the degree of hypo- and dpsproteinemia and, especially, of hyper-beta-lipoproteinemia; in the kidneys the pathomorphological changes characteristic of nephritis become less marked. Azathioprine does not influence the process of acido-and ammoniogeness in the tubuloar system of the nephron, nor does it modify diuresis. The effect of azathioprine is most spectacular in the acive phase of developing nephritis. In rattlings with nephritis theaction af azathioprine in regard to a number of factors (proteins, beta-lipoproteids, gamma-globulins of the blood) is somewhat stronger than in the sexually mature rats.
Angiotensin II (Ang II) mediates progressive nephron loss in diabetes and stimulates apoptotic cell death in several tissues. We studied the extent of apoptosis in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic nephropathy in the rat and the effects of insulin and type 1 (AT1) or type 2 (AT2) Ang II receptor blockade with losartan or PD123319, respectively.
Three groups of rats were studied after 2 and 12 weeks: (1) controls; (2) STZ-diabetic rats (STZ rats), and (3) STZ-diabetic rats with insulin implants. Additional rats were treated with losartan (25 mg/kg/day) and/or PD123319 (10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Kidneys were examined for apoptosis, using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, DNA laddering, and electron microscopy. Immunoblotting determined expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax and of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in proximal tubules.
Diabetes caused a significant increase in apoptosis, involving tubular and interstitial cells of cortex and medulla, but not glomerular cells (2 weeks: controls 264 +/- 94 vs. STZ rats 1,501 +/- 471 apoptotic nuclei/kidney section; p < 0.02; n = 6-8), an effect reversed by insulin. In STZ rats, ultrastructural examination revealed chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in tubular and interstitial cells. At 2 and 12 weeks, a significant decrease in the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 occurred in STZ rat proximal tubules, with restoration by insulin. In STZ rats, treatment for 2 weeks with losartan or PD123319 inhibited apoptosis in the kidneys, with no additive effect of the combination therapy.
Apoptosis occurs in diabetic nephropathy, involving tubular and interstitial cells, an effect reversed by insulin therapy. Furthermore, the effects of AT1 or AT2 receptor blockade suggest that Ang II is involved in mediating apoptosis in the diabetic kidney.
We recently reported on a breastfed infant who succumbed to opioid toxicity following exposure to morphine, the active metabolite of codeine, which was prescribed to his mother who was a cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) ultrarapid metabolizer. This report is believed to be the first case of neonatal fatality as a direct result of maternal drug excretion into breast milk and, therefore, it is critical to corroborate the causative relationship between maternal codeine use during breastfeeding and neonatal opioid toxicity with other existing evidence.
To establish whether maternal use of codeine can be a cause of CNS depression in breastfed infants.
A systematic review of the medical literature using several databases was conducted. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale (NADRPS) was used to examine causality.
In addition to our case report, three abstracts and two full-length studies reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in infants exposed to codeine in breast milk. In total, 35 infants were identified. Specifically, ADRs were described as unexplained episodes of drowsiness, apnea, bradycardia, and cyanosis in suckling infants. Using the NADRPS, codeine was found to be a definite cause of CNS depression in breastfed infants.
The use of codeine by breastfeeding mothers can cause adverse CNS events in breastfed infants. Physicians should recognize codeine use during breastfeeding as a cause of CNS depression in infants, and breastfeeding mothers should be educated on these adverse events before receiving codeine.
Unusual acute symptomatic and reversible early-delayed leukoencephalopathy has been reported to be induced by methotrexate (MTX).
We aimed to identify the occurrence of such atypical MTX neurotoxicity in children and document its MR presentation.
We retrospectively reviewed the clinical findings and brain MRI obtained in 90 children treated with MTX for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or non-B malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma. All 90 patients had normal brain imaging before treatment. In these patients, brain imaging was performed after treatment completion and/or relapse and/or occurrence of neurological symptoms.
Of the 90 patients, 15 (16.7%) showed signs of MTX neurotoxicity on brain MRI, 9 (10%) were asymptomatic, and 6 (6.7%) showed signs of acute leukoencephalopathy. On the routine brain MRI performed at the end of treatment, all asymptomatic patients had classical MR findings of reversible MTX neurotoxicity, such as abnormal high-intensity areas localized in the deep periventricular white matter on T2-weighted images. In contrast, the six symptomatic patients had atypical brain MRI characterized by T2 high-intensity areas in the supratentorial cortex and subcortical white matter (n=6), cerebellar cortex and white matter (n=4), deep periventricular white matter (n=2) and thalamus (n=1). MR normalization occurred later than clinical recovery in these six patients.
In addition to mostly asymptomatic classical MTX neurotoxicity, MTX may induce severe but reversible unusual leukoencephalopathy. It is important to recognize this clinicoradiological presentation in the differential diagnosis of acute neurological deterioration in children treated with MTX.
Losartan potassium is an orally active, nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist. It is the first of a new class of drugs to be introduced for clinical use in hypertension. This novel agent binds competitively and selectively to the AII subtype 1 (AT(1)) receptor, thereby blocking AII-induced physiological effects. An active metabolite, E3174, contributes substantially to its antihypertensive effect, which persists throughout 24 hours after once-daily administration. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, losartan potassium 50 to 100mg once daily as monotherapy lowers blood pressure to a similar degree to enalapril, atenolol and felodipine extended release (ER). Losartan potassium combined with hydrochlorothiazide reduces blood pressure further than either drug given separately. About one-third of patients with severe hypertension have responded to the combination product. Losartan potassium appears to be effective in elderly patients. Losartan potassium is very well tolerated. In clinical trials, dizziness was the only drug-related event reported more frequently with losartan potassium monotherapy than with placebo. First-dose hypotension is uncommon. An aspect of the drug's tolerability profile which may prove to be particularly advantageous is that it is associated with a similar incidence of cough to placebo in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-related cough. Additionally, clinically relevant adverse metabolic effects or laboratory abnormalities have not been documented during losartan potassium therapy and renal function is preserved in patients with or without renal insufficiency. The adverse effect profile of the losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide combination resembles those for losartan potassium monotherapy and placebo. Long term tolerability data are limited (<2 years) but support the very good tolerability profile in shorter studies. Elements of the drug's profile yet to be assessed or reported fully in the literature include long term efficacy; potential to favourably influence cardiovascular and renovascular systems (and ultimately mortality) in patients with hypertension and, lastly, cost effectiveness and influence on quality of life. In summary, losartan potassium is the first AT(1)+ receptor antagonist to become available for the management of hypertension and, as such, it is an important new antihypertensive agent. Pending long term data as outlined above, it is likely to find initial use in patients with mild to severe hypertension who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of their current therapy. However, with its novel mechanism of action, good efficacy and favourable tolerability profile, losartan potassium is well placed to claim a prominent position in the management of patients with essential hypertension in the future.
We have recently shown that carnitine deficiency could represent a risk factor in paracetamol hepatotoxicity. By the same token, d-carnitine-induced carnitine deficiency aggravated carboplatin nephropathy following challenge with a single dose (35mg/kg, IP) of the platinum drug in male Swiss albino rats. The combination modality induced marked degenerative changes and severe inflammation in kidney tissues that surpassed either carboplatin or d-carnitine given alone. The combined regimen synergistically increased the serum levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), palmitate, and kidney malondialdehyde (MDA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nitric oxide (NO) contents as well as kidney myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. The only parameter that has been notably decreased was the kidney reduced glutathione (GSH) level. Exaggeration by carnitine deficit of the deleterious effects of carboplatin is most probably ascribed to energy starvation. The reduction in kidney content of ATP parcels was associated with elevation of serum palmitate level that reflected debilitated fatty acid oxidation, and this further deteriorated energy resources in kidney tissues. Compromising the oxidant/anti-oxidant balance and modulating the release of some inflammatory endocoids namely, TNF-alpha and NO could also possibly account for such combinatorial detrimental toxicity. The current study was further extended to elucidate any possible nephroprotective effects of l-carnitine. Interestingly, carnitine supplementation ahead of carboplatin challenge ameliorated and almost normalized all the biochemical parameters and also mitigated the injurious effects of the cytotoxic drug. Thus, one could conclude that carnitine deficiency, whether being a causative clue or a sequela, might represent a risk factor in carboplatin nephropathy.
1. Following intravenous administration of morphine.HCl a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was produced, quaternary morphine analogue was ineffective. 2. Theophylline and 8-phenyltheophylline administration reduced morphine-induced hypotension. 3. A2 adenosine receptor agonist caused an hypotension while A1 adenosine receptor agonist was ineffective. 4. L-NG-Mono-methylarginine administration reduced the hypotensive effect of exogenous A2 agonist while it was ineffective on morphine-induced hypotension. 5. Morphine-induced hypotension was increased by pretreatment with dipyridamole, whereas tetrabenazine abolished it. 6. The present study is consistent with previous reports on the central hypotensive action of morphine and propose a role for adenosine release in morphine-induced hypotension.
We have described a patient in whom EEG abnormalities, a seizure disorder, and Capgras syndrome developed two weeks after she started taking disulfiram. That disulfiram has been shown to inhibit dopamine beta-hydroxylase in vitro suggests an etiologic role for dopaminergic pathways in at least some cases of Capgras syndrome. Our experience with this patient suggests that convulsions and psychosis may occur as a side effect of standard dosages of disulfiram in patients with no previous history of psychosis or brain disease. Furthermore, the symptoms may resolve spontaneously without the long-term use of antipsychotic or anticonvulsant medication.
7-Nitroindazole (7-NI) inhibits neuronal nitric oxide synthase in vivo and reduces l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in a rat model of parkinsonism. The aim of the present study was to determine if the anti-dyskinetic effect of 7-NI was subject to tolerance after repeated treatment and if this drug could interfere with the priming effect of l-DOPA. Adult male Wistar rats (200-250 g) with unilateral depletion of dopamine in the substantia nigra compacta were treated with l-DOPA (30 mg/kg) for 34 days. On the 1st day, 6 rats received ip saline and 6 received ip 7-NI (30 mg/kg) before l-DOPA. From the 2nd to the 26th day, all rats received l-DOPA daily and, from the 27th to the 34th day, they also received 7-NI before l-DOPA. Animals were evaluated before the drug and 1 h after l-DOPA using an abnormal involuntary movement scale and a stepping test. All rats had a similar initial motor deficit. 7-NI decreased abnormal involuntary movement induced by l-DOPA and the effect was maintained during the experiment before 7-NI, median (interquartile interval), day 26: 16.75 (15.88-17.00); day 28: 0.00 (0.00-9.63); day 29: 13.75 (2.25-15.50); day 30: 0.5 (0.00-6.25); day 31: 4.00 (0.00-7.13), and day 34: 0.5 (0.00-14.63), Friedman followed by Wilcoxon test,vs day 26, P < 0.05;. The response to l-DOPA alone was not modified by the use of 7-NI before the first administration of the drug (l-DOPA vs time interaction, F1,10 = 1.5, NS). The data suggest that tolerance to the anti-dyskinetic effects of a neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor does not develop over a short-term period of repeated administration. These observations open a possible new therapeutic approach to motor complications of chronic l-DOPA therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease.
We studied the role of the dopamine D2 receptor in physiological regulation of pain-related behavior. The experiments were performed in dopamine D2 receptor knockout mice and in their wild-type controls. Baseline sensitivity to thermal nociception was determined by measuring the response latency in the hot plate at three different stimulus temperatures and by determining the radiant-heat-induced paw withdrawal. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed by determining paw withdrawal responses to stimulation with a calibrated series of monofilaments. Intracolonic capsaicin was used to produce sustained pain-related behavior and referred hypersensitivity to mechanical stimulation. The hot plate response latencies were not significantly different between the dopamine D2 receptor knockout and wild-type animals, although the stimulus temperature-dependent decrease in the response latency was steeper in the wild-type group. The radiant-heat-induced paw withdrawal latency was slightly longer in the knockout animals. The number of capsaicin-induced behavioral responses or the latency to the occurrence of the first capsaicin-induced response was not different between the experimental groups. Dopamine D2 receptor knockout animals were more sensitive to mechanical stimulation of the hindpaws than wild-type animals both in the baseline condition and following development of capsaicin-induced referred hypersensitivity in the hindpaws. The results indicate that dopamine D2 receptors influence baseline nociception in the mouse, although this effect is weak and submodality selective. Additionally, dopamine D2 receptors may contribute to attenuation of referred hypersensitivity caused by sustained nociception.
Survivors of paraquat poisoning are left with pulmonary fibrosis which results in a restrictive type of long-term pulmonary dysfunction. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a key growth factor that initiates tissue repair and underlies the development of lung fibrosis. Angiotensin (ANG) II may induce CTGF expression in the heart and kidney and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. The biological effects of ANG II are mediated by ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and AT2R. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of paraquat on ANG II, ANG II receptors, CTGF, and collagen expressions and to assess the role of ANG II receptors in paraquat-induced collagen synthesis in human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5). MRC-5 cells were incubated with various concentrations of paraquat with or without the ANG II receptor antagonist, saralasin. Paraquat increased ANG II production and AT1R mRNA and protein expression and decreased AT2R mRNA expression. Furthermore, paraquat treatment increased CTGF and collagen mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner and saralasin inhibited these effects. These results indicate that paraquat increases CTGF and collagen expression by activating angiotensin signaling pathway in human lung fibroblasts.
Previous research has shown that low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor area and supplementary motor area can reduce L-dopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease; however, it involved only patients with peak-dose or diphasic dyskinesia. We report a case of a patient with severely painful off-period dystonia in the unilateral lower limb who underwent 0.9-Hz subthreshold repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over contralateral primary motor area and supplementary motor area. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor area significantly reduced the painful dystonia and walking disturbances but repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the supplementary motor area did not. The cortical silent period also prolonged after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor area. At 5 mos of approximately once a week repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor area, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score also improved. This report shows that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the inhibitory primary motor area can be useful for rehabilitating patients with Parkinson's disease with off-period dystonia and suggests that this treatment should be further verified in such patients.
To investigate the effect of endothelin and its receptors on ouabain-induced hypertension in rats.
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated with ouabain or saline for 6 weeks and their systolic blood pressure (SBP) were recorded weekly. At the end of 2, 4 and 6 weeks, respectively, the plasma and left ventricle endothelin contents were measured by radio-immunoassay, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR was employed to determine the mRNA level of endothelin type A receptor (ETAR) and type B receptor (ETBR) in the left ventricle, and the protein expressions of ETAR and ETBR were examined by immuno-histochemistry.
After 4 weeks of intraperitoneal ouabain injection, the mean SBP in ouabain group increased till reaching a level significantly higher than that in the control group after 6 weeks (P<0.001). The plasma and left ventricle endothelin contents were significantly increased after 2 weeks of ouabain injection (P<0.01), and similarly, increased ETAR mRNA was observed. After 4 weeks of treatment, ETAR mRNA was increased continuously and the protein expression of ETAR upregulated in ouabain group as compared with the control group. The transcription and protein expression of ETBR were not altered by ouabain treatment.
Before detectable blood pressure elevation occurs, endothelin concentration and ETAR can be already upregulated in ouabain-induced hypertensive rats, suggesting that endothelin might be involved in the cardiovascular effects of ouabain via an action on ETAR.
Despite the widespread use of phenylbutazone, its safety is still a controversial issue. One example of its toxicity is the fact that phenylbutazone has now replaced chloramphenicol as the most common cause of fatal drug-related aplastic anemia. To evaluate the toxicity of phenylbutazone as it is commonly used in sports medicine, a group of 3,000 healthy young athletes was studied following 1-week courses of phenylbutazone for various sports-related inflammatory problems. No serious adverse reactions were encountered. Four percent of the patients experienced mild gastrointestinal disturbances with less than 1% of the patients being forced to discontinue the medication. Compiling the results of other studies, it is estimated that the risk of a serious reaction to phenylbutazone is less than 1 per 100,000 when the drug is used by healthy young individuals for periods of 1 week or less. This risk increases significantly in older patients and with longer periods of treatment. Although phenylbutazone is widely prescribed in sports medicine, there appears to be insufficient information regarding its possible effects on athletic performance.

Further study in this area is urged.
