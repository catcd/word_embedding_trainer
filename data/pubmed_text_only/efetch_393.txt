Leukotrienes play a part in inflammatory response. The unique role of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in the production of leukotrienes makes it a likely therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions like asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of zileuton, an orally active selective 5-LOX inhibitor against the events associated with dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis in a rat model of IBD. The animals were administered simultaneously zileuton (100mg/kg) or sulphasalazine (100mg/kg) orally for 7 days. On day eight, rats were sacrificed, and distal colon isolated to determine myeloperoxidase activity, in vivo superoxide dismutase activity, prostaglandin E2 levels and histological examination. Both zileuton and sulphasalazine significantly prevented the development of inflammatory events associated with colitis. The effect of zileuton was more pronounced towards reducing myeloperoxidase activity and increasing PGE2 levels in distal colon. The results show that chemotactic leukotrienes are responsible for inflammatory surge in damaged colon and, zileuton, significantly improved healing by inhibition of neutrophil recruitment and indirectly through increase in prostaglandins at the site of inflammation. It is suggested that inhibitors of 5-LOX enzyme may have useful therapeutic role in the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation.
Two cases with different and not previously described fatal renal complications during treatment with penicillamine are reported. A man with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis with features of systemic lupus erythematosus was treated with penicillamine for six months and developed a mild membranous glomerulonephritis and a severe renal vasculitis leading to uremia and death. A woman with primary biliary cirrhosis was treated with penicillamine for nine months and developed a nephrotic syndrome, the renal biopsy showing minimal change glomerulonephritis. The nephrotic syndrome responded to prednisone but the patient died, probably from septicemia. Penicillamine may thus cause glomerular damage without deposition of immune complexes. A restricted use of the drug is recommended.
Status epilepticus (SE) can cause severe neuronal loss and oxidative damage. As peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonists possess antioxidative activity, we hypothesize that rosiglitazone, a PPARgamma agonist, might protect the central nervous system (CNS) from oxidative damage in epileptic rats. Using a lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE model, we found that rosiglitazone significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal loss 1 week after SE, potently suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. We also found that treatment with rosiglitazone enhanced antioxidative activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione hormone (GSH), together with decreased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the hippocampus. The above effects of rosiglitazone can be blocked by co-treatment with PPARgamma antagonist T0070907. The current data suggest that rosiglitazone exerts a neuroprotective effect on oxidative stress-mediated neuronal damage followed by SE. Our data also support the idea that PPARgamma agonist might be a potential neuroprotective agent for epilepsy.
The diamidine pentamidine is used to treat leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Treatment may be accompanied by prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram and torsades de pointes tachycardias. Up to now, it has been thought that therapeutic compounds causing QT prolongation are associated with direct block of the cardiac potassium channel human ether a-go-go-related gene (hERG), which encodes the alpha subunit of cardiac I(Kr) currents. We show that pentamidine has no acute effects on currents produced by hERG, KvLQT1/mink, Kv4.3, or SCNA5. Cardiac calcium currents and the guinea pig cardiac action potential were also not affected. After overnight exposure, however, pentamidine reduced hERG currents and inhibited trafficking and maturation of hERG with IC(50) values of 5 to 8 microM similar to therapeutic concentrations. Surface expression determined in a chemiluminescence assay was reduced on exposure to 10, 30, and 100 microM pentamidine by about 30, 40, and 70%, respectively. These effects were specific for hERG since expression of hKv1.5, KvLQT1/minK, and Kv4.3 was not altered. In isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, 10 microM pentamidine prolonged action potential duration APD(90) from 374.3 +/- 57.1 to 893.9 +/- 86.2 ms on overnight incubation. I(Kr) tail current density was reduced from 0.61 +/- 0.09 to 0.39 +/- 0.04 pA/pF. We conclude that pentamidine prolongs the cardiac action potential by block of hERG trafficking and reduction of the number of functional hERG channels at the cell surface. We propose that pentamidine, like arsenic trioxide, produces QT prolongation and torsades de pointes in patients by inhibition of hERG trafficking.
Limbic seizures were evoked in freely moving rats by intrahippocampal administration of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine via the microdialysis probe (10 mM for 40 min at 2 microl/min). This study monitored changes in extracellular hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and dopamine levels after systemic (30 mg/kg/day) or local (intrahippocampal or intranigral, 5 mM or 600 microM for 180 min at 2 microl/min) vigabatrin administration, and evaluated the effectiveness of this antiepileptic drug against pilocarpine-induced seizure activity. Extracellular GABA and glutamate overflow in the ipsilateral cerebellum was studied simultaneously. Microdialysis was used as an in vivo sampling technique and as a drug-delivery tool. Electrophysiological evidence for the presence or absence of seizures was recorded with electrocorticography. The observed alterations in extracellular hippocampal amino acid levels support the hypothesis that muscarinic receptor stimulation by the intrahippocampal administration of 10 mM pilocarpine is responsible for the seizure onset, and that the amino acids maintain the sustained seizure activity. The focally evoked pilocarpine-induced seizures were completely prevented by intraperitoneal vigabatrin premedication for 7 days or by a single intraperitoneal injection. Effective protection was reflected in a lack of sustained elevations of hippocampal glutamate levels. Rats receiving vigabatrin intrahippocampally or intranigrally still developed seizures, although there appeared to be a partial protective effect. During the intrahippocampal perfusion with 5 mM vigabatrin, extracellular hippocampal GABA levels increased, whereas the extracellular glutamate and dopamine overflow decreased. The lack of a complete neuroprotection after local vigabatrin treatment is discussed.
Raloxifene has been developed as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that binds to estrogen receptor (ER) and acts as an estrogen agonist in some tissues while acting as an estrogen antagonist in certain tissues. Raloxifene exerts anti-estrogenic actions in the uterus and the mammary gland, whereas it has estrogenic effects on bone and serum lipids. As a result, raloxifene increases bone volume and reduces vertebral fractures without increasing the incidence of uterine cancer. In addition, raloxifene reduces the incidence of breast cancer to nearly a third of those without raloxifene treatment by markedly reducing the development of ER-positive breast cancer. Raloxifene also reduces the risk of cardiovascular events among postmenopausal women with increased cardiovascular risk. From these observations, postmenopausal osteoporotic women without multiple or severe fractures who have risk factors for breast cancer or cardiovascular disorders can be excellent candidates for raloxifene treatment.
Recent evidence suggests that verapamil administration reduces myocardial and small intestinal damage in canine haemorrhagic shock, and verapamil has also been shown to reduce renal dysfunction in clamp models in post-ischaemic renal failure. The effects of high-dose verapamil and hypovolaemia on renal haemodynamics and function in a canine haemorrhagic shock model were studied. Anaesthetized mongrel dogs were divided into three groups. Animals of group I (n = 5) were not subjected to shock but given a 90-min verapamil infusion (2.28 micrograms/kg); animals of group II (n = 5) were subjected to shock (mean blood pressure 40 mm Hg) for 2 h and given a 90-min 0.9% saline infusion, and animals of group III (n = 7) were both subjected to a 2-hour shock and given verapamil. The electrocardiograph was monitored, and general haemodynamic parameters were measured before shock (period 1), at the end of shock (period 2), after reinfusion of shed blood (period 3) and 1 h after shock (period 4). Total renal and cortical zonal blood flow was estimated by radioactively labelled microsphere injection during each period. Creatinine and osmolar clearance were estimated before and after shock. Verapamil administration caused heart block in groups I and III which lowered heart rate and blood pressure and exacerbated the haemodynamic effects of shock in group III. Despite this, no measurable difference in renal function was recorded between groups II and III. Total renal blood flow fell during shock, and this was exacerbated in animals given verapamil, suggesting a cumulative deleterious effect of shock and verapamil in renal blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Multiple sclerosis is increasingly being recognized as a neurodegenerative disease that is triggered by inflammatory attack of the CNS. As yet there is no satisfactory treatment. Using experimental allergic encephalo myelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis, we demonstrate that the cannabinoid system is neuroprotective during EAE. Mice deficient in the cannabinoid receptor CB1 tolerate inflammatory and excitotoxic insults poorly and develop substantial neurodegeneration following immune attack in EAE. In addition, exogenous CB1 agonists can provide significant neuroprotection from the consequences of inflammatory CNS disease in an experimental allergic uveitis model. Therefore, in addition to symptom management, cannabis may also slow the neurodegenerative processes that ultimately lead to chronic disability in multiple sclerosis and probably other diseases.
Raloxifene is an anti-resorptive agent on bone, regulating turnover by affecting estrogen receptor signals. Reductions in bone metabolic markers become evident in six months after treatment. A large scale randomized clinical trial 3 - 4 years confirmed the 30 - 50% reduction of vertebral fracture risk, similar to the efficacy of nitrogen containing bisphosphonates such as alendronate and risedronate. Risks of non-vertebral fracture were also decreased in patients with severe vertebral fracture treated with raloxifene. Since the anti-fracture effect of raloxifene depends on the regulation of bone metabolism rather than on the increase in bone density, metabolic bone markers seem to useful to monitor the response of patient to the treatment.
The multidrug resistance gene product P-glycoprotein (P-GP) was assessed immunohistochemically (by antibody JSB-1) in biopsy specimens from 27 oesophageal squamous carcinomas and 10 adenocarcinomas before treatment with mitomycin, ifosfamide and cisplatin (MIC). Tumours were assessed following treatment and correlation with response sought. Of the squamous carcinomas, 74% (20/27) responded to MIC but only one expressed P-GP before and after treatment. Of the adenocarcinomas, 30% (three of 10) responded. Seven of the 10 adenocarcinomas expressed P-GP before treatment but all 10 were P-GP positive after chemotherapy. The difference in prevalence and induction of P-GP between the histological types was highly significant and may correlate with the greater response to MIC seen in squamous carcinomas compared with adenocarcinomas. P-GP cannot be used as a predictive marker of response as tumours express it inconsistently with response to MIC. Resistance to MIC may be due to other mechanisms.
Hydroxyzine (Atarax) was compared with three traditional anxiolytics (diazepam, meprobamate, triazolam) for potential amnesic activity in a step-through passive avoidance task in the mouse. The doses investigated were: hydroxyzine (4, 8 and 16 mg/kg); diazepam (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg); meprobamate (8, 16 and 32 mg/kg); triazolam (0.0015, 0.003 and 0.006 mg/kg). The doses investigated were chosen on the basis of prior experiments for not having sedative effects as measured in a photo-cell activity meter. All drugs were administered i.p. 30 min before the first trial of the passive avoidance task. The compounds were also investigated for eventual analgesic activity using the hot plate test. The results indicated that hydroxyzine up to sedative doses was devoid of amnesic activity, whereas clear signs of amnesia were induced by diazepam, meprobamate and triazolam at doses at least 8 times lower than those which reduced spontaneous motor activity. None of the compounds showed analgesic activity in the hot plate test suggesting that the signs of amnesia observed in the passive avoidance test were not due to reduced sensitivity to aversive stimulation.
Withdrawal symptoms for typical antipsychotics are generally mild, self-limited and do not include development of psychotic symptoms. In contrast, withdrawal symptoms for clozapine can be severe with rapid onset of agitation, abnormal movements, and psychotic symptoms. Different pathophysiologic etiologies have been suggested for these severe symptoms, including dopaminergic supersensitivity and rebound.
Three case reports of clozapine withdrawal symptoms are presented. A review of previous case reports and discussion of the etiology of withdrawal symptoms of typical antipsychotics and clozapine are provided.
These three patients developed delirium with psychotic symptoms that resolved rapidly and completely upon resumption of low doses of clozapine.
The severe agitation and psychotic symptoms after clozapine withdrawal in these three patients were due to delirium, perhaps the result of central cholinergic rebound. The withdrawal symptoms and delirium resolved rapidly with resumption of low doses of clozapine. Severe withdrawal symptoms can probably be avoided by slowly tapering clozapine and/or simultaneously substituting another psychotropic with high anticholinergic activity, such as thioridazine.
We report a case of a 13-year-old female with atypical absence seizures induced by prolonged administration of long-acting leuprolide acetate (LA). This patient had brain involvement resulting from chemotherapy and radiotherapy for a medulloblastoma. At 13 years of age, administration of long-acting LA was started. After the third dose of long-acting LA, atypical absence seizures appeared. After discontinuing long-acting LA, the seizures stopped without administration of any antiepileptic drugs. However, 2 years, 6 months later, the same seizures again appeared. On the basis of the findings of endocrinologic investigations and the reported data of pharmacokinetics of LA, we speculate that her seizures were induced by LA and that the seizures were associated with the presence of brain damage in the patient. Care should therefore be taken when using long-acting LA or other gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for pediatric patients with diffuse brain damage.
The role of the Nlrp3 inflammasome in nonallergic airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) has not previously been reported. Recent evidence supports both interleukin (IL) 1β and short fragments of hyaluronan (HA) as contributors to the biological response to inhaled ozone.
Because extracellular secretion of IL-1β requires activation of the inflammasome, we investigated the role of the inflammasome proteins ASC, caspase1, and Nlrp3 in the biological response to ozone and HA.
C57BL/6J wild-type mice and mice deficient in ASC, caspase1, or Nlrp3 were exposed to ozone (1 ppm for 3 hr) or HA followed by analysis of airway resistance, cellular inflammation, and total protein and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Transcription levels of IL-1β and IL-18 were determined in two populations of lung macrophages. In addition, we examined levels of cleaved caspase1 and cleaved IL-1β as markers of inflammasome activation in isolated alveolar macrophages harvested from BALF from HA-treated mice.
We observed that genes of the Nlrp3 inflammasome were required for development of AHR following exposure to either ozone or HA fragments. These genes are partially required for the cellular inflammatory response to ozone. The expression of IL-1β mRNA in alveolar macrophages was up-regulated after either ozone or HA challenge and was not dependent on the Nlrp3 inflammasome. However, soluble levels of IL-1β protein were dependent on the inflammasome after challenge with either ozone or HA. HA challenge resulted in cleavage of macrophage-derived caspase1 and IL-1β, suggesting a role for alveolar macrophages in Nlrp3-dependent AHR.
The Nlrp3 inflammasome is required for the development of ozone-induced reactive airways disease.
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 plays an important role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix in fetal membranes, and pathological activation of MMP-9 can lead to preterm birth. In nongestational tissues, modulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulates MMP-9 expression. The aim of this study was to determine whether class I to III HDACs regulate MMP-9 expression and activity in primary amnion cells. Class I and II HDAC regulation of MMP-9 was assessed using the general class I and II HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), the class I HDACi MS-275, and the class II HDACi MC1568. Class III HDAC regulation of MMP-9 was assessed using the SIRT1 activators resveratrol and SRT1720 as well as SIRT1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Primary amnion epithelial cells were incubated with 1 ng/mL interleukin (IL) 1β in the absence or presence of 0.3 μmol/L TSA, 5 μmol/L SAHA, 2.5 μmol/L MS-275, 2.5 μmol/L MC1568, 50 μmol/L resveratrol, or 10 μmol/L SRT1720 for 20 hours. We found that the class I and II HDACi TSA and SAHA and the class II HDACi MC1568 significantly decreased IL-β-induced MMP-9 gene and pro-MMP-9 expression in primary amnion cells. There was, however, no effect of the class I HDACi MS-275 on IL-β-induced MMP-9 expression. On the other hand, inhibition of class III HDAC SIRT1 using siRNA significantly augmented IL-1β-induced MMP-9, and SIRT1 activation using resveratrol and SRT1720 inhibited IL-1β-induced MMP-9 expression. In summary, class I to III HDACs differentially regulate inflammation-induced MMP-9 expression in primary amnion cells.
Cocaine dependence is associated with severe medical, psychiatric, and social morbidity, but no pharmacotherapy is approved for its treatment in the United States. The atypical antiepileptic vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) has shown promise in animal studies and open-label trials. The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy of vigabatrin for short-term cocaine abstinence in cocaine-dependent individuals.
Participants were treatment seeking parolees who were actively using cocaine and had a history of cocaine dependence. Subjects were randomly assigned to a fixed titration of vigabatrin (N=50) or placebo (N=53) in a 9-week double-blind trial and 4-week follow-up assessment. Cocaine use was determined by directly observed urine toxicology testing twice weekly. The primary endpoint was full abstinence for the last 3 weeks of the trial.
Full end-of-trial abstinence was achieved in 14 vigabatrin-treated subjects (28.0%) versus four subjects in the placebo arm (7.5%). Twelve subjects in the vigabatrin group and two subjects in the placebo group maintained abstinence through the follow-up period. The retention rate was 62.0% in the vigabatrin arm versus 41.5% in the placebo arm. Among subjects who reported prestudy alcohol use, vigabatrin, relative to placebo, was associated with superior self-reported full end-of-trial abstinence from alcohol (43.5% versus 6.3%). There were no differences between the two groups in drug craving, depressed mood, anxiety, or Clinical Global Impression scores, and no group differences in adverse effects emerged.
This first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial supports the safety and efficacy of short-term vigabatrin treatment of cocaine dependence.
We used the recently introduced "metabolomics-on-a-chip" approach to test secondary drug toxicity in bioartificial organs. Bioartificial organs cultivated in microfluidic culture conditions provide a beneficial environment, in which the cellular cytoprotective mechanisms are enhanced, compared with Petri dish culture conditions. We investigated the metabolic response of HepG2/C3a cells exposed to flutamide, an anticancer prodrug, and hydroxyflutamide (HF), its active metabolite, in a microfluidic biochip. The cellular response was analyzed by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify cell-specific molecule-response markers. The metabolic response to flutamide results in a disruption of glucose homeostasis and in mitochondrial dysfunctions. This flutamide-specific metabolic response was illustrated by a reduction of the extracellular glucose and fructose consumptions and a general reduction of the tricarboxylic acid cycle activity leading to the reduction of the consumption of several amino acids. We also found a higher production of 3-hydroxybutyrate and lactate, and the reduction of the albumin production compared with controls. The toxic metabolic signature associated with the active metabolite HF was illustrated by a high-energy demand and an increase in several amino acid metabolism. Finally, for both molecules, the hepatotoxicity was correlated to the glutathione (GSH) metabolism illustrated by the levels of the 2-hydroxybutyrate and pyroglutamate productions and the increase of the glutamate and glycine productions. Thus, the entire set of results contributed to extract specific mechanistic toxic signatures and their relation to hepatotoxicity, which appeared consistent with literature reports. As new finding of HepG2/C3a cells hepatotoxicity, we propose a metabolic network with a related list of metabolite variations to describe the GSH depletion when followed by a cell death for the HepG2/C3a cells cultivated in our polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic biochips. Our findings illustrate the potential of metabolomics-on-a-chip as an in vitro alternative method for predictive toxicology.
It is known that cyanide is converted to thiocyanate in the presence of the enzyme rhodanese. The enzyme is activated by sulfur transfer from an appropriate sulfur donor. The activated enzyme then binds cyanide and transfers the sulfur atom to cyanide to form thiocyanate. This project began as an exploration of the ability of disulfides to act as sulfur donors in the rhodanese-mediated detoxification of cyanide. To our surprise, and contrary to expectations based on efficacy studies in vivo, our in vitro results showed that disulfides are rather poor sulfur donors. The transfer of a sulfur atom from a disulfide to the enzyme must occur via cleavage of a carbon-sulfur bond either of the original disulfide or in a mixed disulfide arising from the reaction of rhodanese with the original disulfide. Extending the reaction time and addition of chloride anion (a nucleophile) did not significantly change the results of the experiment. Using ultrasound as a means of accelerating bond cleavage also had a minimal effect. Those results ruled out cleavage of the carbon-sulfur bond in the original disulfide but did not preclude formation of a mixed disulfide. S-Methyl methylthiosulfonate (MTSO) was used to determine whether a mixed disulfide, if formed, would result in transfer of a sulfur atom to rhodanese. While no thiocyanate was formed in the reaction between cyanide and rhodanese exposed to MTSO, NMR analysis revealed that MTSO reacted directly with cyanide anion to form methyl thiocyanate. This result reveals the body's possible use of oxidized disulfides as a first line of defense against cyanide intoxication. The oxidation of disulfides to the corresponding thiosulfinate or thiosulfonate will result in facilitating their reaction with other nucleophiles. The reaction of an oxidized disulfide with a sulfur nucleophile from glutathione could be a plausible origin for the cyanide metabolite 2-aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid.
Kappa opioid agonists were at one time proposed as candidate pharmacotherapies for cocaine addiction, mainly because of their ability to decrease dopamine neurotransmission and attenuate the behavioral effects of cocaine in laboratory animals. Recent studies, however, suggest that kappa agonists also may mimic and/or enhance some of the effects of cocaine through mechanisms related to stress. The current study used a reinstatement procedure to examine the ability of the kappa agonists spiradoline and enadoline to reinstate extinguished cocaine seeking in squirrel monkeys previously trained to self-administer cocaine under a second-order schedule of i.v. drug injection. Opioid- and stress-related mechanisms were evaluated in antagonism studies with the opioid antagonists naltrexone and nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI), the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor antagonist butyl-ethyl-[2,5-dimethyl-7-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-7H-pyrrolo [2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl]amine (CP 154,526), and the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine combined with either spiradoline or enadoline. When tested alone, priming with spiradoline and enadoline induced significant reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior to approximately 45% of the maximum reinstatement induced by cocaine. Reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by intermediate doses of spiradoline was greater in the presence than in the absence of response-contingent presentations of a cocaine-paired stimulus. Spiradoline- and enadoline-induced reinstatement of drug seeking was attenuated by naltrexone but not by nor-BNI. Spiradoline-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking was also antagonized by CP 154,526 and clonidine. The results point to interactions between a subpopulation of kappa opioid receptors and central corticotropin-releasing factor and noradrenergic stress systems in the reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by kappa agonists.
Epileptic syndromes are highly prevalent neurological conditions and can often be disabling. In order to find an alternative for treatment, this study evaluated anticonvulsant effects of carvacryl acetate (CA), a derivative of monoterpene carvacrol, after seizures induced by pilocarpine (P400), picrotoxin (PIC) or pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). We also analyzed the CA effects on Na+, K+-ATPase and δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) activities in hippocampus mice after seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ. In addition, glutamate, δ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine and aspartate levels in mice hippocampus treated with CA after seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ were also measured. CA produced anticonvulsant effects against seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ, and its effects were reversed by flumazenil, suggesting that action mechanism can be mediated by GABAergic system. CA increased GABA levels, but did not alter glutamate and aspartate concentrations in mice hippocampus after seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ when compared with seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ (p<0.05), respectively, as well as decreased glutamine content in mice hippocampus after seizures induced by PIC when compared with seizures induced by PIC (p<0.05). In addition, CA also increased Na+, K+-ATPase and δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activities after seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ when compared with seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ (p<0.05), respectively. This study demonstrated that CA could be a future therapeutic option for treatment of epilepsy, with a multifactorial brain action mechanism.
A 66-year-old man presented with widespread annular and bullous subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), developed after starting treatment for hypertension with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine. A few days after withdrawal of the drug, while cutaneous manifestations were improving, left hemiparesis occurred. Laboratory investigations showed, in addition to anti-Ro, anti-La and anti-histone antibodies, the presence of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, prolonged APTT and thrombocytopenia. On the basis of the spontaneous regression of the patient's skin lesions after discontinuation of the drug, a possible relationship between nitrendipine intake, the clinical events and the biological findings is discussed.
Renal failure secondary to crescentic glomerulonephritis developed in a patient who had typical serologic features of drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus after two years of therapy with procainamide. Renal function and proteinuria improved after the drug was discontinued and steroid therapy begun. A review of previously reported cases of glomerulonephritis in association with drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus revealed a high incidence of renal failure. Crescentic glomerulonephritis has not to our knowledge been previously documented in drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus.
Five male patients undergoing haemorrhoidectomy received intrathecal meperidine 1 mg X kg-1 as the sole anaesthetic agent. Plasma concentration-time profiles were investigated. The peak plasma concentration of meperidine was 175 +/- 78.8 ng X ml-1 (mean +/- SD) and this occurred 90 minutes after intrathecal injection. The plasma concentrations generally were lower than those necessary for systemic analgesic effects. The terminal elimination half life of meperidine (t 1/2 beta) in the plasma was 198 minutes. Intrathecal meperidine produced good surgical anaesthesia in all patients studied. The mean duration of sensory and motor block was 77 +/- 18.8 and 47 +/- 7.4 minutes respectively. Four patients did not require any analgesic supplement during the postoperative period. No patient developed clinically evident respiratory depression or neurological sequelae. The pharmacokinetic data suggests that intrathecal meperidine provides prolonged postoperative analgesia through a regional effect on opioid receptors in the spinal cord.
Verapamil stimulation test was previously investigated as a tool for differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, but with conflicting results. Macroprolactinemia was never considered in those previous studies. Here, we aimed to re-investigate the diagnostic value of verapamil in a population who were all screened for macroprolactinemia. Prolactin responses to verapamil in 65 female patients (age: 29.9 +/- 8.1 years) with hyperprolactinemia were tested in a descriptive, matched case-control study.
Verapamil 80 mg, p.o. was administered, and then PRL levels were measured at 8th and 16th hours, by immunometric chemiluminescence. Verapamil responsiveness was determined by peak percent change in basal prolactin levels (PRL).
Verapamil significantly increased PRL levels in healthy controls (N. 8, PRL: 183%), macroprolactinoma (N. 8, PRL: 7%), microprolactinoma (N. 19, PRL: 21%), macroprolactinemia (N. 23, PRL: 126%), but not in pseudoprolactinoma (N. 8, PRL: 0.8%), and risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia (N. 7, PRL: 3%). ROC curve analysis revealed that unresponsiveness to verapamil defined as PRL <7%, discriminated anatomical or functional stalk effect (sensitivity: 74%, specificity: 73%, AUC: 0.855+/-0.04, P <0.001, CI: 0.768-0.942) associated with pseudoprolactinoma or risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia, respectively.
Verapamil responsiveness is not a reliable finding for the differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia. However, verapamil unresponsiveness discriminates stalk effect (i.e., anatomically or functionally inhibited dopaminergic tonus) from other causes of hyperprolactinemia with varying degrees of responsiveness.
Propylthiouracil is a commonly used medication for hyperthyroidism. Though propylthiouracil-induced hepatotoxicity is a rarely encountered problem, death due to fulminant hepatic failure may occur. In the English literature, only 34 cases have been described with severe hepatotoxicity secondary to this drug. Here we report a case of fulminant hepatic failure due to propylthiouracil and review the issues of treatment and management with special emphasis on the use of plasmapheresis in such situations.
Patients with advanced cancer, previously untreated, were given 60 mg/m2 cisplatin plus 60 mg/m2 adriamycin by monthly intravenous injections. Signs and symptoms of a predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy developed in 92% of the patients. Patients complained of dysesthesias and paresthesias in hands and feet. Clinically, there was progressive decrease or loss of tendon reflexes, decreased vibratory sense, and mild decrease in light touch and pin sensation. Distal sensory latencies became prolonged or dropped out completely, but there was little change in motor nerve conduction velocities or motor unit action potentials. Sural nerve biopsies showed loss of large-diameter nerve fibers, with axonal and myelin degeneration.
