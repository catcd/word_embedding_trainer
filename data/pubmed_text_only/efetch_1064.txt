Hypoxia in the tubulointerstitium has been thought to play pivotal roles in the pathophysiology of acute renal failure and the progression of chronic kidney disease. Pre-induction of hypoxia-inducible and renoprotective gene expression may protect subsequent ischemic injury. This study evaluated the efficacy of cobalt, which inhibits HIF-1 degradation and increases the expression level of hypoxia-related genes, in an acute ischemic tubulointerstitial injury model of rats. Ischemic renal injury was induced by 45-min clamping of renal pedicles with contralateral nephrectomy. Elevation of serum creatinine and morphologic injury after the ischemic insult was observed. Administration of cobalt chloride afforded striking functional improvement (mean +/- SEM creatinine in mg/dl: Co treatment group, 2.14 +/- 1.21; control, 3.69 +/- 1.43; P < 0.05) associated with amelioration of tubulointerstitial damage. Cobalt treatment also reduced macrophage infiltration significantly. In the kidney of rats treated with cobalt, mRNA levels of several genes that serve for tissue protection, such as HO-1, EPO, Glut-1, and VEGF, were increased before ischemic injury. Upregulation of HO-1 by cobalt was confirmed at the protein level. Subcutaneous injection of cobalt also ameliorated ischemic injury, which was associated with upregulation of renal HIF-1alpha protein expression. These results suggest that protection against hypoxic tubulointerstitial injury by cobalt administration is mediated by induction of renoprotective gene expression. HIF induction is one possible and attractive explanation for the observed effects.
This study describes the results of Dobutamine stress echocardiography in 10 patients with Syndrome X. The diagnosis of Syndrome X was made on the basis of the presence of exertional angina, positive exercise stress test, negative ergonovine stress test and normal coronary arteries at angiography. All patients underwent Dobutamine stress echocardiography after interruption of any antianginal therapy. Dobutamine was infused starting with a dose of 5 mcg/kg/min over 3 minutes with incremental steps of 5 mcg/kg/min every 3 minutes up to a maximal dose of 40 mcg/kg/min. Two-dimensional echocardiography and 12-lead electrocardiography was monitored during the infusion of the drug. Nine patients received the maximal dose while one patient prematurely stopped the test for the occurrence of side effects. None of the ten patients developed segmental left ventricular wall motion abnormalities indicative of myocardial ischemia; ST-segment depression diagnostic for ischemia developed in 30% of patients; angina was elicited in one of these patients and in two additional patients. A hyperkinetic response to Dobutamine infusion involving all the segments of the left ventricle was observed both in patients with and without chest pain or electrocardiographic changes. In patients with Syndrome X Dobutamine induces a hyperkinetic left ventricular response indicative of normal contractile reserve despite the presence in some cases of angina and electrocardiographic signs of ischemia.
Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are effective in reducing renal disease progression in early diabetic nephropathy, but they provide imperfect protection at a later stage. Due to the pivotal role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease, this study tested the effect of simultaneously interrupting TGF-beta and angiotensin II on disease progression in diabetic rats with overt nephropathy. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection in uninephrectomized rats. Diabetic rats received murine (1D11) or human (CAT-192) anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibodies alone or in combination with lisinopril, 13C4 irrelevant murine antibody, saline or lisinopril from month 4 (when animals had proteinuria) to month 8. Normal animals served as controls. Systolic BP increase was controlled by single treatments and even more by the combined therapies. 1D11 and lisinopril kept proteinuria at levels numerically lower than irrelevant antibody and saline, while CAT-192 was ineffective. The addition of either TGF-beta antibody to lisinopril normalized proteinuria. Consistent results were obtained for glomerulosclerosis and tubular damage, which were abrogated by the combined therapy. Interstitial volume expansion and infiltration of lymphocytes/macrophages were limited by 1D11 and lisinopril and further reduced by their combination. The increase of type III collagen in the renal interstitium was partially attenuated by 1D11 and lisinopril while normalized by their combination. It is concluded that anti-TGF-beta antibody when added to a background of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition fully arrests proteinuria and renal injury of overt diabetic nephropathy, providing a novel route to therapy and remission of disease for diabetic patients who do not respond to RAS inhibition.
Three eyes of three patients with advanced primary open angle glaucoma developed hypotony and choroidal detachment 2-3 months following technically uncomplicated trabeculectomy, in one patient and facoemulsification in two patients. The two latter patients had undergone trabeculectomy previously. No wound or bleb leakage were found. Patients did not receive any antiglaucoma medications before the detachment. After treatment with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegic eyedrops both patients showed marked clinical improvement within 2-6 weeks. However, one of the patients after phacoemulsification developed recurrent choroidal detachment shortly after application of timolol drops used due to IOP elevation. Detachment resolved spontaneously after discontinuation of timolol.
Beta2-Adrenergic and chemokine receptor antagonists delay the onset and reduce the severity of joint injury in rheumatoid arthritis. beta2-Adrenergic and chemokine receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor family whose responsiveness is turned off by the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase family (GRK-1 to 6). GRKs phosphorylate receptors in an agonist-dependent manner resulting in receptor/G-protein uncoupling via subsequent binding of arrestin proteins. We assessed the activity of GRKs in lymphocytes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients by rhodopsin phosphorylation. We found a significant decrease in GRK activity in RA subjects that is mirrored by a decrease in GRK-2 protein expression. Moreover, GRK-6 protein expression is reduced in RA patients whereas GRK-5 protein levels were unchanged. In search of an underlying mechanism, we demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines induce a decrease in GRK-2 protein levels in leukocytes from healthy donors. Since proinflammatory cytokines are abundantly expressed in RA, it may provide an explanation for the decrease in GRK-2 expression and activity in patients. No changes in beta2-adrenergic receptor number and Kd were detected. However, RA patients showed a significantly increased cAMP production and inhibition of TNF-alpha production by beta2-adrenergic stimulation, suggesting that reduced GRK activity is associated with increased sensitivity to beta2-adrenergic activation.
Prolactin (PRL) levels were studied in 5 women with Sheehan syndrome before and after metoclopramide (MCP, 10 mg i.v.) and domperidone (MOT, 10 mg i.v.) stimulation. The levels of PRL were measured by RIA method. The obtained results were compared with control group (10 female volunteers). Decreased serum level of PRL was found in 3 women before stimulation in comparison with control group. The highest serum concentration of PRL was found 30 min after MOT and MCP injection. In group of women with Sheehan syndrome the level of PRL was not significantly increased in MCP-test. In MOT-test the level of this hormone did not change. The findings of the present investigation suggest that measurement of PRL serum levels in MOT-test could be of value in early diagnosis of Sheehan syndrome.
This study investigated the effect of ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist or antagonist administration into the nucleus accumbens on the maintenance of cocaine self-administration and the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. The stimulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid or N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors in the nucleus accumbens with either alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid or 1-aminocyclobutane-cis-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, respectively, decreased the number of cocaine-reinforced responses, suggesting an enhancement in the rewarding properties of cocaine. In contrast, blockade of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid receptors with N-methyl-D-aspartate, or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors with dizocilpine maleate or 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid had no selective effect on the maintenance of cocaine self-administration. Following one week of extinction from the reinforcing cue of the drug-paired lever, both alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid and 1-aminocyclobutane-cis-1,3-dicarboxylic acid treatment in the nucleus accumbens reinstated cocaine-seeking behavior. However, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid treatment increased responding only on the drug-paired lever, while 1-aminocyclobutane-cis-1,3-dicarboxylic acid increased responding on both the drug-paired and non-drug-paired levers. These results suggest that stimulation of glutamate receptors in the nucleus accumbens augments the reinforcing effect of cocaine, yet glutamate transmission is not required to maintain cocaine self-administration. In addition, increased glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens may be involved in facilitating the relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior.
Chemical pleurodesis is a frequently performed procedure for pneumothorax and effusion and significant adverse effects are unusual. We present a previously unreported case of acute renal failure associated with tetracycline pleurodesis. Recent studies have shown that intrapleural drug administration may lead to therapeutic serum levels. Systemic toxic drug effects may therefore be noted with chemical pleurodesants such as tetracycline. Alternative methods of pleurodesis should always be considered if a sensitivity or metabolic abnormality is suspected.
The study was purposed to explore the correlation between apoptosis-related gene pnas-2 and leukemia. The RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression levels of pnas-2 gene in NB4, K562, U937 cells before and after treatment with AS(4)S(4), and to analysis the expression change of pnas-2 gene in bone marrow cells from patients with acute leukemia before and after chemotherapy. The results showed that the expression of pnas-2 gene in arsenic sulfide treated NB4 cells was down regulated in time-dependent manner, but the same outcome in K562 and U937 cells after being treated with AS(4)S(4) was not found. The positive expression rate of pnas-2 in cells from untreated patients with acute leukemia was 100%, and was significantly higher than that in normal control group. After chemotherapy, the expression was negative in complete remission patients, whereas in no-remission patients there were no significant differences of expression of pnas-2 before and after treatment. It is concluded that the pnas-2 gene may be closely related with apotosis of arsenic sulfide treated APL cells, and may consider as a molecular biological remission marker in acute leukemia.
The objective of the present study was to investigate whether creatine (Cr) could attenuate the deleterious effects of high doses of dexamethasone (Dexa) on body mass, exercise performance, and respiratory variables of rodents. Forty-four Wistar rats performed incremental maximal exercise tests. They were then assigned to four groups: G1: subcutaneous (s.c.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) saline; G2: s.c. saline and i.p. Cr (250 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)); G3: s.c. Dexa (7.5 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) and i.p. saline; G4: s.c. Dexa and i.p. Cr. New exercise tests and analysis of the respiratory pattern under resting conditions and after stimulation with doxapram (2 mg/kg i.p.) were performed after 18 days. Post- minus pretreatment differences were compared between groups. G3 and G4 showed a significant impairment in body mass gain compared with G1 and G2 (P < 0.05) (G1: 65.3 +/- 26.1, G2: 93.1 +/- 27.4, G3: -18.4 +/- 20.1, G4: 9.8 +/- 23.1 kg x 10(-3)). Similar results were observed for maximal oxygen consumption (G1: 9.5 +/- 8.5, G2: 25.8 +/- 14.5, G3: -25.5 +/- 6.0, G4: -4.8 +/- 9.5 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and test duration (G1: 43.0 +/- 45.0, G2: 72.0 +/- 59.5, G3: -165.0 +/- 60.6, G4: -48.0 +/- 48.5 s). Simultaneous use of Cr significantly attenuated the Dexa-induced impairment of the last two variables. Cr attenuated Dexa-induced gastrocnemius and diaphragm muscle weight losses and the atrophy of gastrocnemius type IIb fibers. Cr supplementation had only small effects on Dexa-induced respiratory changes. These results suggest that Cr may play a role in the prophylaxis or treatment of steroid-induced myopathy.
It has been reported that anti-metallothionein (a metallothionein antibody) is present in the circulation of healthy subjects and in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cadmium-induced renal dysfunction is related to the presence of the plasma metallothionein antibody (MT-Ab) in workers exposed to cadmium (Cd) occupationally. Plasma metallothionein antibody was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques, and both exposure assessment and risk assessment were conducted in cadmium-exposed workers in China. We demonstrate that there is a significantly increased prevalence of renal dysfunction with respect to the level of urinary cadmium in a dose-dependent manner. We found no significant correlations between the levels of MT-Ab and the external or internal exposure doses of cadmium (p > 0.05), but the levels of MT-Ab did correlate positively with two biomarkers of renal dysfunction-urinary beta2-microglobulin (UB2M; r = 0.218, p < 0.05) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (UNAG; r = 0.302, p < 0.001)-in the cadmium-exposed workers. Workers who have high levels of MT-Ab display cadmium-induced tubular nephrotoxicity more frequently than those possessing low levels of MT-Ab; odds ratio (OR) 4.2; 95% confidence intervals 1.2-14.5 (p < 0.05). This study suggests that subjects that have higher MT-Ab levels more readily develop cadmium-induced renal dysfunction. Thus, the levels of plasma MT-Ab can be used as a biomarker of susceptibility to renal dysfunction in occupational cadmium exposure.
Reactions to recombinant human insulin preparations occur at a rate of 2.4%. Although most have been traced to immunological reactions to the insulin, recent reports suggest that some adverse reactions can occur to the nonmedicinal excipients or preservatives of commercially available insulin preparations.
To investigate a localized delayed cutaneous reaction to human insulin.
Intradermal and patch testing were performed on a patient to evaluate sensitivity to commercial human insulins, meta-cresol, and other sensitizers.
Patch test results were positive to the meta-cresol preservative.
This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a reaction to meta-cresol in commercial preparations of insulin. This reaction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adverse reactions to insulin injections.
Primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is associated with an increased frequency of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), mainly of low histological grade. However, aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) characterised by poor treatment outcome can also be encountered in SS. It has recently been shown that rituxan has significant therapeutic activity in this type of lymphoma.
To evaluate the efficacy of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) in combination with rituxan in SS patients with DLBCL, and to determine the outcome in such patients.
In an open, single case trial, six SS patients with DLBCL were assigned to receive eight cycles of CHOP every three weeks plus rituxan given on day 1 of each cycle. In a retrospective study, conducted by the European Concerted Action for SS, nine cases were diagnosed as DLBCL, all of whom had been treated with CHOP alone. These patients were used as historical controls.
The difference in the overall survival between the two treatment groups was significant. The group treated with rituxan plus CHOP had a 100% two year overall survival rate, while the historical controls had only a 37% survival rate. Extraglandular manifestations serving as predictors for lymphoma development such as palpable purpura and peripheral neuropathy disappeared. The remission of these signs was accompanied by a decrease in both circulating monoclonal cryoglobulins and rheumatoid factor activity and an increase in C4 levels. Clinically relevant toxicity was not detected.
The addition of rituxan to standard CHOP chemotherapy results in improved treatment outcome in SS patients with aggressive DLBCL, without increasing toxicity.
Giant cell tumour of bone (GCT) is an aggressive primary neoplasm that results in the production of osteolytic lesions. Stromal cells, which form the main neoplastic component of this tumor, regulate the formation of osleoclast-like giant cells that are ultimately responsible for bone destruction. Bisphosphonates prevent bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting osteoclast apoptosis, and they have been known to induce apoptosis of primary neoplastic cells such as those in breast and prostate cancers. We hypothesized that in bisphosphonates may induce apoptosis not only in osteoclast-like giant cells but also in neoplastic stromal cells of GCT both in vitro and in vivo. Twelve patients with GCT were treated with weekly injections of pamidronate for a period of 6 weeks prior to surgery. GCT specimens were collected at the time of biopsy and during definitive surgery. TUNEL assay was used to evaluate apoptotic DNA fragmentation in cells. In addition, twelve GCT primary cultures from these patients were treated with zoledronate, pamidronate, or alendronate for 48 hours at different doses (3, 30, or 150 microM) and subjected to apoptosis assay by flow cytometry following fluorescent Annexin-V labeling. The results showed that pamidronate significantly induced apoptosis in both osteoclast-like giant cells and stromal tumor cells, in vivo. All three bisphosphonates caused substantial apoptosis of stromal tumor cells in cultures. Zoledronate was the most potent reagent, resulting in an average cell death of 27.41% at 150 microM, followed by pamidronate (22.23%) and alendronate (15.3%). Our observations suggest that these drugs may be considered as potential adjuvants in the treatment of GCT.
Intravenous diltiazem (10-300 micrograms/kg), verapamil (10-300 micrograms/kg), nifedipine (1-100 micrograms/kg) and nicardipine (1-100 micrograms/kg) inhibited the tachycardia caused by cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS, 0.5-4 Hz) in decentralized hearts of anesthetized dogs. The dose range of each drug required to inhibit the SNS-induced tachycardia was almost equivalent to that required to produce the increase in coronary blood flow and the decrease in blood pressure. Nifedipine and nicardipine were equi-active and about 10 times more potent than diltiazem and verapamil in inhibiting the SNS-induced tachycardia. They produced a slight but dose-dependent slowing of the resting heart rate. The negative chronotropic potency was approximately nicardipine, verapamil greater than nifedipine, diltiazem. Bay K 8644 (30 micrograms/kg) antagonized the inhibitory effects of diltiazem (100 micrograms/kg) and nifedipine (30 micrograms/kg) on the SNS-induced tachycardia. Tachycardia induced by intracoronary norepinephrine (0.03-0.3 micrograms) was suppressed by diltiazem (30-300 micrograms/kg) and nifedipine (10-100 micrograms/kg). The inhibitory effects of calcium entry blocking drugs on the sympathetic tachycardia appear to be explained by the interference of the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in slow inward current in the sinoatrial (SA) node. It is also suggested that other mechanisms different from calcium entry blocking action contribute to the negative chronotropic response to these calcium entry blocking drugs.
Obesity is associated with increased risks of several cancers including colon and female breast. Pesticide use in agricultural populations has also been linked with higher risks of various cancers. However, the interaction between obesity and pesticide use on cancer risk has not been well studied. Using data from the Agricultural Health Study, we examined the association between body mass index (BMI) and the risk of cancer at 17 sites and the interaction between BMI and pesticide use. Pesticide applicators residing in Iowa and North Carolina and their spouses were enrolled between 1993 and 1997 and given a self-administered questionnaire to obtain pesticide use and other information. This analysis included 39,628 men and 28,319 women with height and weight data who were cancer-free at enrollment. Among these participants, 4,432 were diagnosed with cancer between enrollment and 2005 and 64% were overweight or obese. BMI (per 1 kg/m(2)) was positively associated with colon cancer in men (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.09) and breast cancer in postmenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06). In contrast, BMI was inversely associated with lung cancer in men, with a significant association in ever smokers (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97) and a null association in never smokers. The positive association between BMI and colon cancer in men was significant in those who ever used carbofuran (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.17; p-interaction = 0.04) or metolachlor (HR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.15; p-interaction = 0.02) but was null in non-users of these pesticides. Among male ever smokers, the inverse association between BMI and lung cancer was significant in non-users of carbofuran (HR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.82-0.92) but was null in users of carbofuran (p-interaction = 0.02). These findings suggest that certain pesticides may modify the effects of BMI on the risks of colon and lung cancers.
We investigated the melatonin (MT) circadian rhythm before and after somatostatin (octreotide) acute administration in ten subjects (4 M, 6 F. 23-52 yr old) with active acromegaly due to pituitary microadenoma. Blood samples were drawn every 2 hours over a 48-h span; after 24-h basal blood collection, octreotide (Sandostatin, Sandoz) 100 micrograms sc/8 h was administered. As control, 7 healthy adult subjects (3M, 4F; 26-50 yr old) were studied in basal condition over a 24-h span. Plasma MT and GH levels were measured by RIA in each sample, IGF-1 levels were measured by immunoradiometric assay in basal and after octreotide morning samples. The comparisons were made by Mann-U-Withney and Wilcoxon test as appropriate; the existence of a MT circadian rhythm was validated by cosinor analysis; GH and MT values were correlated by Pearson's correlation coefficient. All of 7 control subjects and 2 of 10 acromegalics had significant 24-h MT rhythm. The area under curve (AUC), mesor and amplitude of the MT rhythms in acromegalics were significantly lower than in the controls (p < 0.001, 0.002 and 0.0006, respectively), with an earlier acrophase (median value: 22:14 vs 02:08 h of controls). Basal plasma IGF-1 levels and circadian GH concentrations were significantly increased in acromegalics in comparison with the control group. Octreotide administration significantly reduced GH, restoring a circadian MT rhythm in 5 of 10 acromegalics, with MT mean mesor and AUC not different from controls. Mean amplitude still remained lower than controls (p < 0.0006), with an earlier acrophase (median 00:01 h). No significant correlation was found between individual GH and MT levels. Our data indicate a reduction of MT circadian secretion in acromegaly, due especially to a blunted nocturnal increase with earlier MT peak; moreover, acute octreotide administration increase MT levels without modifying amplitude and phase of night-time secretion significantly. These findings suggest a negative interrelationship between GH and MT secretions or a facilitatory influence of somatostatin on daytime MT release only. This partial recovery of pineal secretion after octreotide in acromegalics could be a clinically significant contribution to improve their quality of life, considering that MT is involved in the regulation of several important functions.
The authors describe the first case of myocardial infarction in their department which occurred during 5-fluorouracil treatment. In a 37 year-old patient two years before the infarction an epidermoid carcinoma of the lower lip was found. The patient was subjected to operation and radiotherapy. Because of a relapse of the process after one year the patient was re-operated with subsequent chemotherapy (vincristine, methotrexate, cis-platinum). Because the effect was not satisfactory, after another year 5-fluorouracil treatment was started (i.v. infusion of 3000 mg in two days). In the course of the infusion the patient developed the clinical picture of a non-transmural infarction of the anterior wall. The course was uncomplicated. The ECG returned to normal on the 9th day after discontinuation of 5-fluorouracil treatment. The effect of 5-fluorouracil on the heart is explained by a coronary vascular spasm. The authors recommend therefore administration of calcium blockers.
A case of acute heart failure due to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by 5-fluorouracil is described. Acute heart failure developed during the administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and levofolinate calcium in a 62-year-old woman who had underwent a Miles operation for rectal adenocarcinoma. Electrocardiography upon admission showed slight ST elevation in leads V1-3, and follow-up electrocardiography on the third hospital day evealed QT interval prolongation and giant negative T waves in leads II, III, aVF, and V1-6. Echocardiography and myocardial scintigraphy showed left ventricular apical ballooning in the acute phase of heart failure, but left ventricular contraction was normal during the recovery phase. Coronary angiography demonstrated normal coronary arteries, and multi-vessel coronary artery vasospasms including microcirculation disorders could be provoked by intracoronary acetylcholine infusion during, but not before, the intravenous administration of levofolinate calcium and 5-FU. The cause of heart failure in this patient, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by multivessel coronary vasospasm including microcirculation disorders only during 5-FU administration, is notable.
To provide further evidence of cardiovascular adverse effects of ondansetron, including new-onset atrial fibrillation, ST segment elevation, and chest pain subsequent to ondansetron administration, and to review cardiovascular adverse events related to several 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonists.
A 51-year-old male with an uncomplicated past medical history was admitted for an elective inguinal hernia repair and septoplasty. His maintenance medications were discontinued prior to surgery. After a second 4-mg dose of intravenous ondansetron was administered, he developed nausea and diaphoresis. His electrocardiograph revealed new-onset atrial fibrillation and inferolateral ST segment elevation with ST segment alternans. During emergent cardiac catheterization, no obstructive coronary artery disease was evident. The patient's heart rhythm was electrically converted to normal sinus rhythm. During 3 years of follow-up, he has had no return of chest pain or hypotension.
Although considered a safe class of medications by many clinicians, several of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists have been associated with serious cardiovascular effects. Three case reports described cardiac dysrhythmias and 9 documented coronary vasospasm and chest pain, possibly resulting from ondansetron. This is the first reported case of a combination of hypotension, atrial fibrillation, ST segment elevation, and chest pain following ondansetron administration after elective surgery in a healthy adult male with a nonconfounding medication profile. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that ondansetron was the probable cause of these cardiovascular events.
This case report supports the concern regarding cardiovascular adverse effects of ondansetron. Clinicians should be aware of cardiovascular adverse reactions that may be associated with intravenous ondansetron and monitor for electrocardiographic changes as indicated. Further investigation is needed to delineate the actual incidence of cardiovascular effects associated with ondansetron and whether the intravenous rate of administration is a contributing factor.
Previously, we showed that 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) treatment prevented the subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced cerebral vasospasm in male rats. The aim of this study was designed to further delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying E(2)-induced inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) upregulation and relief of vasospasm caused by SAH.
The 2-hemorrhage SAH model was induced by 2 autologous injections of blood into the cisterna magna of adult male rats. The rats were then subcutaneously implanted of a Silastic tube containing corn oil with or without 17beta-estradiol benzoate and received daily intraperitoneal injections of various doses of ICI 182,780, a nonselective estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, for 7 days after the first hemorrhage. Basilar arteries were then removed for protein extraction, RNA isolation, and gel mobility assay. The protein levels of iNOS, p65, and ER were examined by Western blot analysis, and that iNOS mRNA expression was evaluated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.
E(2) prevented the SAH-induced vasospasm and increases of the levels of iNOS protein and mRNA in basilar artery through an ER-dependent mechanism. Treatment of the SAH rat with E(2) did not affect the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappaB, but caused an increase of the association of p65/ER, and reversed the SAH-induced increase of the p65 binding on iNOS promoter.
E(2) inhibits the SAH-induced increase of iNOS by increasing the association of p65/ER, which in turn inhibits the binding of p65 to iNOS DNA. Our data suggest the potential applications of E(2) in the treatment of SAH patient.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by a Protozoan. Clinically and histopathologically, it can be confused with various dermatologic diseases.
We report a case of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) with two unusual findings. A 49-year-old male patient presented to our clinic with a 3-month history of multiple nodules exhibiting arciform arrangement on the lateral side of the left leg.
Histopathologic examination revealed it as nodular vasculitis. Leishmania smear showed suspicious parasites. Although leishmania culture was negative, PCR was positive for Leishmania. The patient was considered to have CL and was treated with systemic meglumine antimoniate for 14 d. Three days after the end of the treatment, the patient presented to emergency room with a sharp, pleuritic chest pain. He was diagnosed with pericarditis based on clinical and electrocardiogram findings. As other causes of pericarditis were absent, it was thought to be related to antimony therapy.
The histopathologic presentation of CL as panniculitis is a very rare and this is the first case of pericarditis after the antimony treatment.
1. We determined glomerular and medullary tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA levels in acute puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis on days 0, 8 and 20. 2. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA levels were increased fourfold in glomeruli and twofold in the medulla during the nephrotic stage of acute puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (day 8). 3. The high tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA levels in both glomeruli and the medulla were ameliorated significantly by methylprednisolone administration. 4. Focal glomerular sclerosis was induced in rats by injection of puromycin aminonucleoside on days 0, 27, 34 and 41 and by unilateral nephrectomy on day 22. 5. The percentage of sclerosing glomeruli was 16.6% on day 48 and had increased significantly to 72.8% on day 80. 6. During the sclerotic phase of puromycin amino-nucleoside nephrosis, glomerular tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA levels increased as glomerular sclerosis progressed. On day 80, glomerular tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA levels were 13-fold higher than levels in control rats. 7. These data suggest that glomerular tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA expression is associated with the development of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced glomerular sclerosis.
