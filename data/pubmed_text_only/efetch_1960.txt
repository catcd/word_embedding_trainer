Methadone is increasingly prescribed for chronic pain, yet the associated mortality appears to be rising disproportionately relative to other opioid analgesics. We review the available evidence on methadone-associated mortality, and explore potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic explanations for its greater apparent lethality. While methadone shares properties of central nervous system and respiratory depression with other opioids, methadone is unique as a potent blocker of the delayed rectifier potassium ion channel (IKr). This results in QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes (TdP) in susceptible individuals. In some individuals with low serum protein binding of methadone, the extent of blockade is roughly comparable to that of sotalol, a potent QT-prolonging drug. Predicting an individual's propensity for methadone-induced TdP is difficult at present given the inherent limitations of the QT interval as a risk-stratifier combined with the multifactorial nature of the arrhythmia. Consensus recommendations have recently been published to mitigate the risk of TdP until further studies better define the arrhythmia risk factors for methadone. Studies are needed to provide insights into the clinical covariates most likely to result in methadone-associated arrhythmia and to assess the feasibility of current risk mitigation strategies.
Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been known to play a role in the modulation of inflammatory responses. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism by which RSG regulates the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Firstly, we examined the preventive effect of RSG on the inflammatory mediators induced by spheroid culture of synovial sarcoma SW982. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines under spheroid culture was more elevated than that under monolayer culture while RSG abolished inflammatory responses. The upregulation of inflammation-related genes by spheroid culture was closely associated with NFkappaB (NFkappaB) activation. Also, activation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by spheroid culture was abrogated with RSG treatment. Lastly, it was demonstrated that RSG reduced the development of arthritis in mice immunized with collagen, improving the histology of inflamed joint. In summary, RSG reduces inflammatory responses of synovial fibroblast via not only inhibition of NFkappaB but also modulation of both p38 and JNK.
In this report, we have investigated the relationship between androgen levels and prostate tumorigenesis in Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mice, a genetically engineered mouse model of human prostate cancer. By experimentally manipulating serum levels of testosterone in these mice for an extended period (i.e., 7 months), we have found that prolonged exposure of Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mice to androgen levels that are 10-fold lower than normal (the "Low-T" group) resulted in a marked acceleration of prostate tumorigenesis compared with those exposed to androgen levels within the reference range (the "Normal-T" group). We found that prostate tumors from the Low-T mutant mice share a similar gene expression profile as androgen-independent prostate tumors from these mutant mice, which includes the deregulated expression of several genes that are up-regulated in human hormone-refractory prostate cancer, such as Vav3 and Runx1. We propose that exposure to reduced androgens may promote prostate tumorigenesis by selecting for molecular events that promote more aggressive, hormone-refractory tumors.
The purpose of this study is to report the case of a patient with normal lithium serum levels who developed non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). A 52-year-old woman with bipolar disorder type I (DSM-IV) treated with lithium experienced bradypsychism and episodes of confusion and spatial disorientation without signs or symptoms of lithium intoxication. Lithium serum levels were in the normal range. A brain MR scan was negative; the electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a background 3-4 Hz delta rhythm and diffuse spike discharges. Prompt EEG and clinical response to intravenous diazepam therapy was observed. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of NCSE was made and lithium therapy was withdrawn, resulting in symptom remission and EEG normalization. The treatment was resumed after two months to test the correlation between NCSE and lithium therapy. Resumption of therapeutic range lithium induced the same clinical symptoms and EEG patterns; the therapy was thus definitively discontinued. The present data-signalling the temporal correlation of clinical and EEG changes with drug administration and withdrawal-suggest that even in the therapeutic range lithium treatment may trigger NCSE onset in predisposed subjects.
The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on the proteinuria and degree of focal glomerular sclerosis hyalinosis (FSH) in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy (PAN) were examined. Chronic PAN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by seven subcutaneous injections of puromycin aminonucleoside (20 mg/kg) over 10 weeks (Groups I and II). Group II rats also received enalapril 10 mg/kg/day in the drinking water throughout the study (12 weeks). Group III rats served as age-matched controls. Proteinuria was similar in Groups I and II (35.5 +/- 9.7 versus 29.1 +/- 4.1 mg protein/mg creatinine, mean +/- SEM, P greater than 0.05). Serum creatinine remained unchanged in Group I, but rose from 0.7 +/- 0.04 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dl (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.05) in Group II. FSH was 13.8% in Group I, 12.9% in Group II (P greater than 0.05), and 0.6% in Group III. There was no significant difference in glomerular lipid content and in immunofluorescence for rat albumin, fibrinogen, IgM, IgG, and C3 between Groups I and II. ACE activity was inhibited by 94% in serum, 83% in lungs, and 92% in kidneys; and blood pressure response to. Angiotensin I challenge was decreased by 50% in rats similarly treated with enalapril versus controls. In summary, proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis in this model are not affected by ACE inhibition.
In accordance with a case report of a 7-year-old boy with bronchial asthma, who was twice treated with aminophylline and each time reacted upon this with an aggressive behaviour, which was completely abolished after stopping the medication and which did not appear after application of theophylline, we became suspicious, that this side effect could be due only to the ethylenediamine.
Addiction to opiates and illicit use of psychostimulants is a chronic, relapsing brain disease that, if left untreated, can cause major medical, social, and economic problems. This article reviews recent progress in studies of association of gene variants with vulnerability to develop opiate and cocaine addictions, focusing primarily on genes of the opioid and monoaminergic systems. In addition, we provide the first evidence of a cis-acting polymorphism and a functional haplotype in the PDYN gene, of significantly higher DNA methylation rate of the OPRM1 gene in the lymphocytes of heroin addicts, and significant differences in genotype frequencies of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the P-glycoprotein gene (ABCB1) between "higher" and "lower" methadone doses in methadone-maintained patients. In genomewide and multigene association studies, we found association of several new genes and new variants of known genes with heroin addiction. Finally, we describe the development and application of a novel technique: molecular haplotyping for studies in genetics of drug addiction.
Mancozeb is a protectant fungicide and is a polymeric complex of ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate)manganese (i.e. Maneb) with zinc salt. In this study, the tumour initiating ability of mancozeb has been observed by a 2-stage initiation-promotion protocol in mouse skin.
The only curative treatment for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is prophylactic surgery and the two most popular options are total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis and restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Today, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has gained wider acceptance as a safer procedure, but ileorectal anastomosis still remains an option, especially for young patients with a moderate phenotype of the disease and limited polyps in the rectum. Partial or complete regression of rectal polyps after total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis and treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as sulindac is reported in up to 80 % of patients. However, in some cases such regression can be spontaneous and long-lasting following total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, without further treatment with NSAIDs. We present the cases of four patients with FAP treated by colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, who had immediate, complete spontaneous regression of multiple polyps in the rectal stump, with no further need for sulindac treatment.
A new anthracycline analog, epirubicin (4'-epi-Adriamycin) was evaluated at eleven institutes in a phase II clinical study in patients with malignant lymphoma. Epirubicin was administered intravenously mainly with using the following two regimens; 50 to 60 mg/m2 every three weeks and 40 mg/m2 weekly. A total of 46 cases were entered into the study and 41 cases were evaluable. Clinical responses, complete plus partial remissions, were observed in 27 cases (65.9%) with 8 of these showing complete remission. There was no significant difference of response between the two regimens. Response rates taking into account previous chemotherapy were 90.9% (10/11) in previously nontreated cases, 61.9% (8/13) in cases previously treated with non-anthracyclines and 52.9% (9/17) in cases treated with anthracyclines. The major adverse effect was bone marrow suppression; leukopenia was observed in 83.8%, anemia in 60.5% and thrombocytopenia in 15.4%. Other adverse effects frequently observed were anorexia (59.0%), nausea-vomiting (48.8%) and alopecia (55.6%). These adverse effects seemed milder than those produced by doxorubicin. The results indicated that epirubicin seemed to be a markedly useful drug against malignant lymphoma.
To evaluate the possible protective effects of misoprostol on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with indomethacin.
Forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin, 150 mg/day (Group A), or indomethacin 150 mg/day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg/day (Group B). Laboratory variables of renal function [serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolytes] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days, until termination of the study (a period of at least 6 days). Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain.
Forty-two patients completed the study, 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B. BUN and creatinine increased by > 50% of baseline levels in 54 and 45% of Group A patients, respectively, compared to only 20 and 10% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). Potassium (K) increment of 0.6 mEq/l or more was observed in 50% of Group A, but in only 15% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). The mean increments in BUN, creatinine, and K were reduced by 63, 80, and 42%, respectively, in Group B patients compared to Group A. Response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing indomethacin related renal dysfunction. Addition of misoprostol can minimize this renal impairment without affecting pain control.
Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) mutations are involved in about 20% of all cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). Recently, it has been proposed that aberrant copper activity may be occurring within SOD at an alternative binding, and cysteine 111 has been identified as a potential copper ligand. Using a commercial source of human SOD isolated from erythrocytes, an anomalous absorbance at 325 nm was identified. This unusual property, which does not compromise SOD activity, had previously been shown to be consistent with a sulfhydryl modification at a cysteine residue. Here, we utilized limited trypsin proteolysis and mass spectrometry to show that the modification has a mass of 32 daltons and is located at cysteine 111. The reaction of SOD with sodium sulfide, which can react with cysteine to form a persulfide group, and with potassium cyanide, which can selectively remove persulfide bonds, confirmed the addition of a persulfide group at cysteine 111. Gel electrophoresis and glutaraldehyde cross-linking revealed that this modification makes the acid-induced denaturation of SOD fully irreversible. Furthermore, the modified protein exhibits a slower acid-induced unfolding, and is more resistant to oxidation-induced aggregation caused by copper and hydrogen peroxide. Thus, these results suggest that cysteine 111 can have a biochemical and biophysical impact on SOD, and suggest that it can interact with copper, potentially mediating the copper-induced oxidative damage of SOD. It will be of interest to study the role of cysteine 111 in the oxidative damage and aggregation of toxic SOD mutants.
Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3), also known as type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, is a downstream steroidogenic enzyme and converts androgen precursors to the potent androgen receptor ligands: testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone. Studies have shown that AKR1C3 is involved in the development of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and that it is a rational drug target for the treatment of CRPC. Baccharin, a component of Brazilian propolis, has been observed to exhibit a high inhibitory potency and selectivity for AKR1C3 over other AKR1C isoforms and is a promising lead compound for developing more potent and selective inhibitors. Here, we report the screening of fifteen baccharin analogs as selective inhibitors against AKR1C3 versus AKR1C2 (type 3 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase). Among these analogs, the inhibitory activity and selectivity of thirteen compounds were evaluated for the first time. The substitution of the 4-dihydrocinnamoyloxy group of baccharin by an acetate group displayed nanomolar inhibitory potency (IC50: 440nM) and a 102-fold selectivity over AKR1C2. By contrast, when the cinnamic acid group of baccharin was esterified, there was a dramatic decrease in potency and selectivity for AKR1C3 in comparison to baccharin. Low or sub-micromolar inhibition was observed when the 3-prenyl group of baccharin was removed, and the selectivity over AKR1C2 was low. Although unsubstituted baccharin was still the most potent (IC50: 100nM) and selective inhibitor for AKR1C3, these data provide structure-activity relationships required for the optimization of new baccharin analogs. They suggest that the carboxylate group on cinnamic acid, the prenyl group, and either retention of 4-dihydrocinnamoyloxy group or acetate substituent on cinnamic acid are important to maintain the high potency and selectivity for AKR1C3.
There is increasing interest in phytoestrogens as potential alternatives to synthetic selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) in the prevention and therapy of breast cancer. The present study is aimed at determining whether dietary glycine soya (Glycine max seeds; GS), which is rich in phytoestrogens, can enhance the anti breast cancer efficacy of the SERM tamoxifen (TAM) and the effect of TAM and GS, either alone or in combination, on DMBA-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis in rat. For determination of enhancing effect, rats bearing palpable 7, 12-dimethylbenz[α] anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors were treated with TAM (10 mg kg(-1)/day) while being fed AIN-93G diet with or without added GS (3×10(4) mg kg(-1)), and the tumor growth was monitored up to 5 weeks of treatment. For determining the effect on hepatocarcinogenesis, DMBA-initiated rats were exposed to TAM and dietary GS as above for 6 weeks during promotion stage in a medium-term bioassay, and the development of placental form of glutathione-S-transferase (GST-P)-expressing preneoplastic liver lesions was quantified. Exposure to both TAM and dietary GS enhanced the anti tumor efficacy of TAM via a combination of tumor cell apoptosis (determined by TUNEL) and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation (determined by PCNA immunostaining) and suppressed the growth of GST-P-positive liver lesions. The findings show that dietary GS enhances the therapeutic efficacy of TAM against mammary tumors and minimizes TAM's hepatocarcinogenesis promotion potential.
A young woman with amenorrhea-galactorrhea induced by a prolactin (PRL) secreting pituitary macroadenoma, was treated with bromocriptine 5 mg/day per os. Serum PRL levels were normal at 6 weeks and menstruation appeared at 8 weeks of treatment. When twenty months of treatment were completed, a tomographic study of the pituitary was unable to show any enlargement. Controversies related to macroprolactinomas treatment are discussed and it is suggested that treatment with dopamine agonists must be the elective treatment for patients with macroprolactinoma.
Thoracic epidural anesthesia is considered as an essential component of the perioperative care for patients undergoing lung resection. Although neurologic adverse events have been associated with this technique, permanent injury is rare. These events primarily involve the peripheral nervous system; for example, nerve root injury. We present a case of persistent cortical blindness after a test dose of bupivacaine was administered into an uneventfully placed thoracic epidural catheter.
A 4.5 year old boy with cerebral palsy presented with seizures associated with facial flushing and tachycardia following the instillation of 1% cyclopentolate, a commonly used mydriatic in paediatric practice. He had no prior history of convulsions. This case demonstrates the uncommon, though serious, atropine-like side effect of cyclopentolate eyedrops (Cyclogyl, Alcon) in usual dosage in a brain damaged child without an epileptic focus.
Craniofacial malformations are among the most frequent congenital birth defects in humans; cleft palate, that is inadequate fusion of the palatal shelves, occurs with an annual incidence of 1 in 700 to 1 in 1,000 live births among individuals of European descent. The secondary palate arises as bilateral outgrowths from the maxillary processes, and its formation depends on the coordinated development of craniofacial structures including the Meckel's cartilage and the mandible. Cleft lip and palate syndromes in humans are associated with polymorphisms in the gene (TGFA) encoding transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand made by most epithelia. Here we have characterized craniofacial development in Egfr-deficient (Egfr-/-) mice. Newborn Egfr-/- mice have facial mediolateral defects including narrow, elongated snouts, underdeveloped lower jaw and a high incidence of cleft palate. Palatal shelf explants from Egfr-/- mice fused, but frequently had residual epithelium in the midline. In addition, morphogenesis of Meckel's cartilage was deficient in cultured mandibular processes from Egfr-/- embryos. The secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was diminished in Egfr-/- explants, consistent with the ability of EGF to increase MMP secretion and with the decreased MMP expression caused by inhibition of Egfr signalling in wild-type explants. Accordingly, inactivation of MMPs in wild-type explants phenocopied the defective morphology of Meckel's cartilage seen in Egfr-/- explants. Our results indicate that EGFR signalling is necessary for normal craniofacial development and that its role is mediated in part by its downstream targets, the MMPs, and may explain the genetic correlation of human cleft palate with polymorphisms in TGFA.
The high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, its lack of satisfactory effective drugs and its complicated pathophysiology lead to the demand of new therapeutic agents. During a new drug development process, the pharmacokinetic profiling is of a great considerable importance comparable to drug's efficacy. This involves the drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, all of which are crucial to its usefulness. In addition, the toxicological profile and possible adverse reactions of the drug should be identified. Also its interactions should be identified at different phases of trials. Several pharmacokinetic studies are carried out to achieve drugs with the best absorption and bioavailability and the least adverse effects and lowest toxicity.
To make an update on new clinically introduced drugs for IBS and their dynamics and kinetics data, the present systematic review was accomplished. All relevant bibliographic databases were searched from the year 2003 up to May 2012 to identify all clinical trials that evaluated the potential efficacy of a novel agent in IBS.
Some evaluated drugs, such as ramosetron (5-HT3 antagonist) and pexacerfont (CRF1 receptor antagonist), have shown some benefits in diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS), while, prucalopride and mosapride (5-HT4 agonist) with prokinetic effect were found useful in constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS). Besides, dexloxiglumide, lubiprostone and linaclotide have shown beneficial effects in C-IBS patients. Melatonin regulates GI tract motility and, asimadoline, gabapentin and pregabalin show reduction of pain threshold and visceral hypersensitivity. Glucagon-like peptide analog, calcium-channel blockers and neurokinin receptor antagonists have shown benefits in pain attacks. More time is required to indicate both efficacy and safety in long-term treatment due to multifactorial pathophysiology, variations in individual responses and insufficient assessment methods, which limit the right decision-making process about the efficacy and tolerability of these new drugs.
The human paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) is a high-density lipoprotein-associated enzyme, mainly secreted by the liver, that displays protective properties toward cardiovascular disease and organophosphate intoxication. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic phytoalexin found in grapes and wine and is thought to display cardioprotective effects. It is able to interact with transcriptional modulators such as the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). We investigated the effect of resveratrol on the PON-1 gene expression.
PON-1 activity assays, Northern blot, and transfection experiments showed that resveratrol increased the PON-1 gene expression in human hepatocyte primary cultures and in the HuH7 hepatoma cell line involving a transcriptional mechanism. The resveratrol effect was not ERalpha-dependent and was surprisingly mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and an unconventional AhR responsive element in the PON-1 gene promoter. This agonist effect of resveratrol was specific for this DNA motif and was not observed on classical AhR responsive elements.
These observations suggest that the PON-1 gene induction may be involved in the cardioprotective properties of resveratrol. They also highlight a ligand-dependent differential modulation of AhR-sensitive genes.
The behavioural and electrocortical power spectrum effects of tryptoline and the 5-hydroxy and 5-methoxy derivatives were studied after microinjection of the drugs into the third cerebral ventricle in freely moving rats. The three compounds produced a dose-dependent desynchronication in electrocortical activity with a concomitant syndrome of behavioural stimulation. The most potent compound was 5-methoxytryptoline, already active at 4 nmol. When given into the third cerebral ventricle, 5-methoxytryptoline antagonized the sedation and hypothermia induced by reserpine. The relative order of potencies was 5-methoxytryptoline greater than 5-hydroxytryptoline greater than tryptoline. Melatonin, the 5-methoxy-N-acetyl derivative of serotonin, when injected into the third cerebral ventricle, did not produce desynchronization and elicited only mild sedation. The high potency of 5-methoxytryptoline following injection into the third cerebral ventricle and the relative order of potencies with 5-hydroxytryptoline and tryptoline is compared to the affinity of these compounds for the modulatory site of the serotonin transporter which was labelled with [3H]imipramine or [3H]paroxetine.
Nicardipine-induced tachycardia is generally attributed to the involvement of the baroreflex. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) as well as on plasma catecholamine levels were studied in six conscious dogs made hypertensive by sinoaortic denervation. Nicardipine (50, 100 and 200 micrograms/kg i.v.) induced both a significant decrease in mean BP and a marked increase in HR in these dogs whereas the catecholamines rose significantly. Nicardipine-induced tachycardia cannot be explained by a baroreflex mechanism only. It is suggested that nicardipine induces an increase in HR and sympathetic tone, probably by a direct action on central cardiovascular mechanisms.
The remarkable susceptibility of the inner ear of the patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas) to the ototoxic action of dihydrostreptomycin (DHSM) (and streptomycin (SM)) is well established in this paper and affords a rare example of a species-specific reaction to a restricted class of compounds within the aminoglycoside group of antibiotics. In a series of experiments, behavioral and morphological observations together provided the following profile of DHSM ototoxicity in the patas monkey: Sudden onset of hearing loss beginning after 7-9 weeks of treatment; Substantial, though often partial, hearing impairment beginning at the high frequencies and progressing with or without continued treatment to the low frequencies; In the inner ear, a corresponding and selective loss of nerve fibers and of outer hair cells, relative to inner hair cells, beginning in the base of the cochlea and proceeding toward the apex; Continued and progressive loss of hearing for several months after cessation of drug treatment; and Non-auditory effects in some animals on the kidney and vestibular system. Results from control experiments confirmed this special relationship between the patas monkey and DHSM: Other nonhuman primates (macaques and vervet monkeys) were essentially unaffected by DHSM; The patas showed no equivalent sensitivity to other aminoglycosides such as kanamycin or to other forms of ototraumatic insult such as intense noise.
