Thirty-eight obese patients, resistant to conventional diet therapy, agreed to consume a 1.09 MJ (260 kcal)/day semi-synthetic diet consisting of 25 g egg albumin, 40 g oligosaccharides, vitamins and minerals, and were seen weekly as outpatients for eight weeks. At the beginning, the semi-synthetic diet was given with either the anorectic drug, mazindol (2 mg/day) or a placebo for four weeks and then changed over for the remaining four weeks; the study being conducted on a double-blind basis. The final treatment was a 4.2 MJ (1000 KCAL) conventional diet for a further four weeks without drug or placebo. Twenty-five patients completed the first eight weeks and 21 patients the final four weeks of the trial. The total mean weight losses were as follows: week 4, 9.3 kg; week 8, 13.7 kg; week 12, 12.2 kg. There was no significant difference in weight loss between mazindol treatment and placebo but the former group reported feeling less hungry. The chief side-effects observed were dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, insomnia and depression which were more frequent with mazindol. Six patients had to stop mazindol because of side-effects, but were able to continue the diet alone. It is concluded that a semi-synthetic diet containing 1.09 MJ (260 kcal) daily can be successfully employed in the treatment of obese outpatients, and is a practical therapeutic alternative to admission to hospital. There is no clinical advantage to be gained by the additional use of the anorectic drug, mazindol.
Migraine patients abusing ergotamine often have chronic daily headaches associated with tiredness, sleep and memory disturbances, and reduced general well-being. We quantified psychological and cognitive functioning in 12 migraine patients with and 12 without ergotamine abuse (> or = 5 days/week for > or = 6 months) and 12 healthy controls. Psychological functioning assessed by Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and Profile Of Mood State (POMS), was impaired in ergotamine abusers compared to healthy controls. Cognitive functioning divided into four domains: attention (critical flicker frequency analysis and mental control subscale of the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), speed of information processing (reaction time tasks and lexical decision tasks), memory (four subscales of the WMS) and cognitive flexibility (trailmaking test and WMS digits backwards), was impaired in ergotamine abusers in speed of information processing and cognitive flexibility. These differences disappeared after correction for total SCL-90 scores. In conclusion, ergotamine abuse is associated with high psychological distress but not with structural impaired cognitive functioning.
Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is a recently identified glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein belonging to the Thy-1/Ly-6 family of cell surface antigens. Prior data in prostate cancers indicated that PSCA is directly regulated by androgens and PSCA expression increases with high-tumor grade, advanced stage, extracapsular invasion, and androgen-independent progression. The effect of complete androgen ablation (CAA) on tumor PSCA mRNA expression has not been elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the variations in the expression levels of PSCA mRNA before and after CAA, and further evaluate the clinically prognostic value of PSCA in human prostate carcinoma.
PSCA in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed on the cancerous pretreatment biopsy or transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) tissue of 42 men with primarily organ-confined prostate cancer before CAA, and on their tumor tissue from radical retropubic prostatectomy after CAA with bicalutamide and goserelin acetate for 3 months prior to undergoing radical prostatectomy. Tumor cytoplasmic staining of PSCA mRNA was evaluated by two independent pathologists and the differences of PSCA mRNA expression levels between the samples before and after CAA were analyzed using the Student's t-test. Thirty-six to forty months follow-up studies after radical retropubic prostatectomy were performed and aimed at assessing the correlation of PSCA mRNA expression level with local recurrences or metastases from the cancer.
The percent of cells positive for PSCA mRNA by ISH labeling declined from 67.3% (0-89%)+/-9.4% before CAA to 33.8% (0-92%)+/-7.7% after CAA (P<0.001). Before CAA, 40 of 42 cases (95.2%) were positive for PSCA mRNA labeling, however, after CAA the percentage of positive reactivity of PSCA mRNA was decreased to 27 of 40 cases (67.5%), in which none was found with local recurrences or distant metastases after radical prostatectomy on follow-up. This decline in PSCA mRNA labeling was dependent on the original tumor grade with Gleason score of <or=6: 19.3%+/-4.7%, Gleason score of 7: 38.8%+/-7.2%, and a Gleason score of >or=8: 73.4%+/-13.8% (P<0.05, respectively). The rest 13 cases had the increased percentage of cells positive for PSCA mRNA after CAA, in which 3 cases were found with local recurrences and 4 cases with distant metastases from tumor on follow-up.
Our data demonstrate that CAA for prostate cancer can suppress PSCA mRNA expression with a tumor grade dependence and the increased expression of PSCA mRNA after CAA may be a clinically adverse predictor for tumor recurrences or distant metastases.
Phytotherapies have offered alternative sources of therapy for migraine and gained much importance in prophylactic treatment. Sapindus trifoliatus is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing wild in south India that belongs to the family Sapindaceae. The pericarp is reported for various medicinal properties. A thick aqueous solution of the pericarp is used for the treatment of hemicrania, hysteria or epilepsy in folklore medicine. We have investigated the antihyperalgesic effects of the lyophilized aqueous extract of S. trifoliatus in animal models predictive of experimental migraine models using morphine withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia on the hot-plate test and on 0.3% acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions in adult male Swiss albino mice. The extract significantly (N = 10, P < 0.05) increased the licking latency in the hot-plate test when administered i.p. at 10 mg/kg (6.70 +/- 0.39 s in saline control vs 18.76 +/- 0.96 s in S. trifoliatus-treated animals) and significantly (N = 10, P < 0.001) reduced the abdominal constrictions when administered i.p. at 2 and 10 mg/kg (40.20 +/- 1.36 in saline control vs 30.20 +/- 1.33 and 23.00 +/- 0.98 for 2 and 10 mg/kg, i.p., respectively, in S. trifoliatus-treated animals). Furthermore, when administered i.p. at 20 and 100 mg/kg, the extract significantly (N = 10, P < 0.05) inhibited the apomorphine-induced climbing behavior in mice (climbing duration 15.75 +/- 5.0 min for saline control vs 11.4 +/- 1.28 and 3.9 +/- 1.71 min for 20 and 100 mg/kg, respectively, in S. trifoliatus-treated animals). In receptor radioligand-binding studies, the extract exhibited affinity towards D2 receptors. The findings suggest that dopamine D2 antagonism could be the mechanism involved in the antihyperalgesic activity of the aqueous extract of S. trifoliatus.
Through whole-genome sequencing of 2,630 Icelanders and imputation into 11,114 Icelandic cases and 267,140 controls followed by testing in Danish and Iranian samples, we discovered 4 previously unreported variants affecting risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). A low-frequency (1.47%) variant in intron 1 of CCND2, rs76895963[G], reduces risk of T2D by half (odds ratio (OR) = 0.53, P = 5.0 × 10(-21)) and is correlated with increased CCND2 expression. Notably, this variant is also associated with both greater height and higher body mass index (1.17 cm per allele, P = 5.5 × 10(-12) and 0.56 kg/m(2) per allele, P = 6.5 × 10(-7), respectively). In addition, two missense variants in PAM, encoding p.Asp563Gly (frequency of 4.98%) and p.Ser539Trp (frequency of 0.65%), confer moderately higher risk of T2D (OR = 1.23, P = 3.9 × 10(-10) and OR = 1.47, P = 1.7 × 10(-5), respectively), and a rare (0.20%) frameshift variant in PDX1, encoding p.Gly218Alafs*12, associates with high risk of T2D (OR = 2.27, P = 7.3 × 10(-7)).
Extracellular matrix remodeling crucial to tumorigenesis involves proteolytic enzymes, primarily matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMP production is stimulated by multiple factors, including the extracellular matrix metallo-proteinase inducer EMMPRIN/CD147. Overexpression of EMMPRIN, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, promotes invasion, metastasis, growth and survival of malignant cells. Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a multifunctional protein that promotes cancer progression in various cancer types. CypA can interact with and activate EMMPRIN; however, the role of CypA-EMMPRIN interaction in oncogenicity is not completely understood. To investigate tumorigenicity induced by the CypA-EMMPRIN interaction, we stimulated EMMPRIN-expressing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells with CypA. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye assay revealed that HNSCC cell proliferation increased upon stimulation of the cells with CypA, whereas cisplatin-induced cell death decreased after stimulation. Gelatin zymography showed that CypA also induced MMP-9 up-regulation. Moreover, HNSCC cell invasion through Matrigel™-coated membranes was increased upon stimulation of cells with CypA. This elevated invasive potential was abrogated by an EMMPRIN function-blocking antibody. These findings suggest that CypA, through its interaction with EMMPRIN, contributes to HNSCC tumorigenesis.
A 33-year-old woman presented with chest and abdominal pain shortly after first and second applications of the nicotine patch. Type A aortic dissection was diagnosed and repaired. Pathological examination revealed cystic medial necrosis, subacute and acute dissection, with no evidence of chronic aortic insufficiency. The close temporal relationship between applications of the nicotine patch and onset of symptoms compatible with dissection followed by extension raises the possibility that the nicotine patch was implicated in, or precipitated, this woman's aortic dissection.
Large doses of chloroquine can cause poisoning. Our aim was to determine the possible relation between the plasma potassium concentration on admission with the severity of acute chloroquine poisoning and to assess the mechanism of chloroquine-induced hypokalaemia. We conducted a retrospective study of 191 consecutive cases. The main data included the occurrence of vomiting before admission, plasma, and urinary potassium concentration at admission, whole blood chloroquine concentration on admission, haemodynamic parameters and ECG, administration of catecholamines and outcome. Mean blood chloroquine level was 20.1 mumol/L (SD 14.3) (therapeutic level < or = 6 mumol/L). Mean plasma potassium concentration was 3.0 mmol/L (0.8) and was lower in the subjects who died than in those who survived (p = 0.0003). Plasma potassium varied directly with the systolic blood pressure and inversely with the QRS and QT. Plasma potassium varied inversely with the blood chloroquine (p = 0.0001; tau = -0.42). Acute chloroquine intoxication is responsible for a hypokalaemia which correlates with the gravity of the intoxication and may be due to a transport-dependent mechanism. Plasma potassium concentrations should be carefully observed, particularly among patients who also receive catecholamine infusions. We should keep in mind, however, that overzealous repletion invokes the risk of subsequent hyperkalaemia and thus should be avoided.
Garlic oil (GO) has been shown to partially attenuate ethanol-induced fatty liver, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The current study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of GO against ethanol-induced steatosis in vitro and in vivo, and to explore potential mechanisms by investigating the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1), and etc. In the in vitro study, human normal cell LO2 was exposed to 100 mM ethanol in the presence or absence of GO for 24 h. We found that ethanol increased the protein levels of n-SREBP-1c and CYP2E1, but decreased the protein levels of PPAR-α, which was significantly attenuated by GO co-treatment. In the in vivo study, male Kun-Ming mice were pretreated with single dose of GO (50-200 mg/kg body weight) at 2 h before ethanol (4.8 g/kg body weight) exposure. The changes of n-SREBP-1c, PPAR-α and CYP2E1 were paralleled well to those of in vitro study. Furthermore, GO significantly reduced the protein levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), and suppressed ethanol-induced hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction. These results suggested that GO had the potential to ameliorate alcoholic steatosis which might be related to its modulation on SREBP-1c, PPAR-α, and CYP2E1.
The rest and exercise hemodynamic-inotropic response to administration of the beta-blocker pindolol was evaluated in 10 patients with congestive cardiomyopathy to determine whether the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of this agent may preserve ventricular function in the setting of beta-blockade. A significant (p less than .05) rise in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and a decline in stroke volume and cardiac index was observed after a single 10 mg dose. The change in cardiac index was negatively correlated with free drug concentration (r = -.59, p less than .01); the change in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance showed a positive correlation with plasma concentration (r = .67, r = .57, respectively; all p less than .05). The response to exercise reflected a predominant beta-blocking effect, with a significant decrease in peak heart rate and cardiac index and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. There were no significant changes in variables of right or left ventricular inotropy after administration of the drug. The mean baseline plasma norepinephrine concentration for the population was 609 +/- 172 pg/ml (normal = 196 +/- 7 pg/ml) and was markedly elevated in two patients (931 and 2053 pg/ml) who developed severe pindolol-induced hypotension. Renin increased markedly in these two patients, but decreased in each of the remaining eight patients. These data indicate that although inotropy is not adversely affected by pindolol, increased afterload, which appears to be mediated by peripheral beta-blockade, results in a reduction in ventricular performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The treatment of worsening Multiple Sclerosis (MS) remains challenging. Mitoxantrone, an anthracyclines, is approved as a treatment for worsening MS. However, systematic analyses of its tolerability and effectiveness outside of controlled trials are few. Certain advantages, including easy application and simple monitoring, need to be balanced against its toxicity.
To study efficacy, tolerability and feasibility of mitoxantrone treatment in a regular clinical setting.
Retrospective analysis of data from 96 MS patients with worsening MS before, during, and after mitoxantrone. Specifically, we addressed adherence and reasons for deviations from the intended treatment schedule regarding tolerability and safety, and consequences of deviations on clinical efficacy.
Schedule deviations were frequent. Only a third of patients received the intended cumulative dose. Hematological toxicity was generally mild and transient. In 7 patients, treatment was withheld because of impact on ventricular ejection fraction, in the absence of clinical symptoms of cardiac failure. No malignancies were observed. With respect to clinical benefit, most patients remained stable and the relapse rate decreased with mitoxantrone initiation in both relapsing and secondary MS patients (p<0.0001). A possible modest non-significant dose-effect on annualized relapse rates was observed.
Mitoxantrone may be considered for treatment of refractory MS. Poor tolerability impacted adherence but dose-limiting safety events were rare. Mitoxantrone needs to be carefully assessed in light of recent data on risk of cardiotoxicity and leukemia.
The importance of caspase-2 activation for mediating apoptosis in cancer is not clear and seems to differ between different tumour types. Furthermore, only few data have been obtained concerning the expression of caspase-2, which can be alternatively spliced into caspase-2L and caspase-2S, and the other PIDDosome members PIDD and RAIDD in human tumours in vivo. We, therefore, investigated their expression in renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) of the clear cell type in vivo and analysed the role of caspase-2 in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in RCCs in vitro.
The analyses were performed by semiquantitative real-time PCR, Western Blot and Caspase-2 Assay.
Our in vivo results showed an overall decrease in proapoptotic caspase-2L expression during tumour progression due to an increase in the relative share of caspase-2S mRNA in total caspase-2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, an increase in the expression of PIDD and RAIDD could be observed. In contrast, antiapoptotic BCL-2 expression increased only during early tumour stages, whereas expression decreased in pT3 RCCs. In vitro, caspase-2 activation in RCC cell lines coincidenced with sensitivity of tumour cells towards Topotecan-induced apoptosis. However, inhibition of caspase-2 could not prevent Topotecan-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, Topotecan-resistance could be overcome by the apoptosis-sensitizing drug HA14-1.
Our study confirms the concept of a shift towards a more antiapoptotic transcriptional context during tumour progression in RCCs. Furthermore, it shows that caspase-2 participates in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in RCCs although it is not mandatory for it. Additionally, inhibition of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members might provide a possible way to overcome chemotherapy resistance of RCCs.
Glutamate receptors and their related second messengers in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are known to play critical roles in the initiation of behavioral sensitization to cocaine.
To evaluate the hypothesis that repeated intra-VTA microinjections of the ionotropic glutamate agonist, AMPA, or the metabotropic glutamate agonist, t-ACPD, augment the behavioral hyperactivity induced by a subsequent challenge injection of cocaine. In addition, the dependency of the t-ACPD effect on activation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaM-Ks) was assessed.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats received four once-daily microinjections of saline, AMPA, t-ACPD, or t-ACPD plus the CaM-KII inhibitor KN-93 directly into the VTA; locomotor activity was measured for 120 min after each of the daily treatments. One week after the 4 treatment days, all animals received a challenge injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, IP) and behavioral activity was monitored for 120 min.
Intra-VTA administration of t-ACPD increased behavioral activity only on the first 2 treatment days, an effect that was blocked by pre-treatment with KN-93. Administration of AMPA into the VTA, in contrast, produced behavioral hyperactivity that sensitized over the 4 treatment days. Following the cocaine challenge injection, there was an augmentation of cocaine-induced behavioral hyperactivity in the groups pretreated with AMPA or t-ACPD but not in the animals administered t-ACPD plus KN-93.
These results indicate that repeated stimulation of AMPA or metabotropic glutamate receptors in the VTA mimics the initiation of behavioral sensitization to cocaine. The present findings also suggest that glutamate agonist-induced activation of CaM-KII in the VTA plays a critical role in the behavioral and neuronal plasticity induced by repeated cocaine injections.
A neuroanatomical principle of striatal organization has been established through which ventral domains, including the nucleus accumbens, exert control over dorsal striatal processes mediated by so-called "spiraling," striato-nigro-striatal, circuitry. We have investigated the functional significance of this circuitry in the control over a cocaine-seeking habit by using an intrastriatal disconnection procedure that combined a selective, unilateral lesion of the nucleus accumbens core and infusion of a dopamine receptor antagonist into the contralateral dorsolateral striatum, thereby disrupting striato-midbrain-striatal serial connectivity bilaterally. We show that this disconnection selectively decreased drug-seeking behavior in rats extensively trained under a second-order schedule of cocaine reinforcement. These data thereby define the importance of interactions between ventral and dorsal domains of the striatum, mediated by dopaminergic transmission, in the neural mechanisms underlying the development and performance of cocaine-seeking habits that are a key characteristic of drug addiction.
Three cases of long QT-interval due to halofantrine were documented in 1992 in France. Two of them had a congenital long QT-interval (Romano-Ward syndrome). We performed a prospective study of cardiac monitoring in 20 patients taking halofantrine. Minimal ECG changes were noted with lengthening of the QT-interval. Systematic ECG is necessary before giving halofantrine.
We discus the case of a forty-nine year old patient with haloperidol induced laryngeal dystonia (LD). Laryngeal dystonia is a life threatening, very rare medical condition which is difficult to diagnose. It can occur after a short treatment of a patient with atypical antipschycotics. LD can induce severe respiratory insufficiency leading to hypoxemia and death. Due to the lack of diagnosis, we performed an emergency tracheotomy because of severe respiratory distress syndrome. An emergency tracheotomy can be a life-saving procedure in patients with LD.
BP 2-94 is a prodrug of the H3-receptor agonist (R)-alpha-methylhistamine [(R)-alpha-MeHA]. BP 2-94 displayed anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and ulcero-protective properties in experimental animals.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of BP 2-94 in a model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.
In order to investigate the effect of BP 2-94 it was applied to rats either alone (20, 40 and 60 micromol kg(-1), 4 days) or as a pretreatment (20, 40 and 60 micromol kg(-1), 4 days) before the application of CCl4 (0,2 ml kg(-1), 2 days).
BP 2-94 in the tested doses did not cause significant changes in the plasma aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities and the liver microscopic appearance was normal. Hepatocyte damage, as evident by local areas of liver necrosis and elevated levels of plasma AST and ALT, occurred in rats following acute exposure to CCl4 (0,2 ml kg(-1), 2 days). BP 2-94 applied as a pretreatment dose-dependently reduced the necrotic changes in rat liver and inhibited the increase of plasma AST and ALT activities in response to CCl4.
BP 2-94 had a hepatoprotective effect in a model of CCl4-induced toxicity in rats. This effect might be due the H3-agonistic activity of its active metabolite (R)-alpha-MeHA.
The base excision repair (BER) pathway is important in repairing DNA damage incurred from occupational exposure to 1,3-butadiene (BD). This study examines the relationship between inherited polymorphisms of the BER pathway (x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) Arg194Trp, Arg280His, Arg399Gln, T-77C, ADPRT Val762Ala, MGMT Leu84Phe and APE1 Asp148Glu) and chromosomal damage in BD-exposed workers, using the cytokinesis-blocked (CB) micronucleus (MN) assay in peripheral lymphocytes of 166 workers occupationally exposed to BD and 41 non-exposed healthy individuals. The MN frequency of exposed workers (3.39 +/- 2.42) per thousand was higher than that of the non-exposed groups (1.48 +/- 1.26) per thousand (P < 0.01). Workers receiving greater than median annual BD exposures had higher MN values than lower exposed workers: frequency ratio (FR) of 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.53; P < 0.05. Workers who carried the following genotypes were associated with greater frequency of MN (P < 0.05 for each comparison, unless specified): XRCC1 -77 C/T genotype (FR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.57; reference C/C), ADPRT 762 Ala/Ala (FR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.17-2.03; P < 0.01), XRCC1 194 Arg/Trp (FR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.87-1.27; reference, Arg/Arg), XRCC1 280 Arg/His (FR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.10-2.42; reference, Arg/Arg), XRCC1 399 Arg/Gln and Gln/Gln genotypes (FR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.03-1.53 and FR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.49; reference Arg/Arg, respectively). As XRCC1 polymorphisms were linked, workers carrying the XRCC1 (-77)-(194)-(280)-(399) diplotype, TCGA/TCGA, had a higher MN frequency compared with individuals carrying the wild-type CCGG/CCGG (FR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.02-2.41; P < 0.05). In conclusion, CB-MN is a sensitive index of early damage among BD-exposed workers. In workers exposed to BD, multiple BER polymorphisms and a XRCC1 haplotype were associated with differential levels of chromosome damage.
Selective estrogen-receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs) are synthetic nonsteroidal compounds that switch on and switch off target sites throughout the body. Tamoxifen, the pioneering SERM, blocks estrogen action by binding to the ER in breast cancers. Tamoxifen has been used ubiquitously in clinical practice during the last 30 years for the treatment of breast cancer and is currently available to reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women. Raloxifene maintains bone density (estrogen-like effect) in postmenopausal osteoporotic women, but at the same time reduces the incidence of breast cancer in both high- and low-risk (osteoporotic) postmenopausal women. Unlike tamoxifen, raloxifene does not increase the incidence of endometrial cancer. Clearly, the simple ER model of estrogen action can no longer be used to explain SERM action at different sites around the body. Instead, a new model has evolved on the basis of the discovery of protein partners that modulate estrogen action at distinct target sites. Coactivators are the principal players that assemble a complex of functional proteins around the ligand ER complex to initiate transcription of a target gene at its promoter site. A promiscuous SERM ER complex creates a stimulatory signal in growth factor receptor-rich breast or endometrial cancer cells. These events cause drug-resistant, SERM-stimulated growth. The sometimes surprising pharmacology of SERMs has resulted in a growing interest in the development of new selective medicines for other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. This will allow the precise treatment of diseases that was previously considered impossible.
Aripiprazole is a novel antipsychotic medication characterized by partial agonism at the D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and by antagonism at the 5-HT2A receptor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate, in an open-label pilot study, the effects and safety of very small doses of aripiprazole on L-dopa-induced dyskinesia of a group of PD patients who did not show a significant clinical benefit by pharmacological treatment with amantadine and mirtazapine. Twelve PD patients with peak-dose LID were enrolled in a period of 1 year. Aripiprazole dosage was of 0.625 mg/day. The ten patients who continued taking aripiprazole displayed a significant decrease in the intensity and frequency of dyskinesias in all parts of the body, particularly in trunk movements (AIMS score T(0) = 14.1 +/- 3.6 vs. final score 2.4. +/- 2.6; P = 0.005). Our study suggests that aripiprazole at very low doses is tolerated and could be efficacy in treating LID.
Local anesthetics when injected intravascularly result in serious cardiac complications including therapy-resistant cardiac arrest. We report a case of cardiac arrest after lumbar plexus block using a combination of 0.5% bupivacaine and 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:200.000). Resuscitation was performed by a combination of chest compression, repeated external countershocks and i.v.epinephrine. Clonidine had poor effect. The whole resuscitation required 90 minutes. The patient was discharged four days later without any sequelae. Blood sampling at 10 minutes showed a concentration of 2.02 mg/l lidocaine and 0.87 mg/l bupivacaine. Prolonged resuscitation is necessary in local anesthetic-induced cardiac arrest.
The authors report adverse events (AEs) related to the use of chlorhexidine gluconate mouthrinse in a clinical trial of the efficacy of periodontal treatment in older adults with diabetes.
Participants were U.S. veterans with uncontrolled diabetes (hemoglobin A(1c) value > or =8.5 percent) and periodontal disease. Treatment included periodontal scaling, 0.12 percent chlorhexidine lavage during ultrasonic scaling and use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse at home.
Forty-four (31 percent) of 140 subjects reported having AEs. Most common were taste changes and tooth staining, sore mouth and/or throat, tongue irritation and wheezing/shortness of breath; the latter was reported more commonly before chlorhexidine use than after. Only body mass index greater than 30 was significantly related to AEs.
AEs are common among subjects using chlorhexidine mouthrinse. Most AEs (taste change and staining) were resolved easily by subjects' discontinuing mouthrinse use and receiving dental prophylaxis. No serious AEs were reported.
Clinicians should advise patients using chlorhexidine mouthrinse of possible side effects. If necessary, patients should discontinue mouthrinse use and obtain medical care. Careful monitoring of AEs in patients using chlorhexidine is warranted.
A rat model was developed for use in evaluating postural hypotensive activity of a compound. Conscious normotensive rats were restrained on a tilt board with special restrainers to avoid blocking limb circulation. Dose response curves were explored to delineate the potential postural hypotensive activity of a compound. In response to a 2-min 90 degree head-up tilt, only a negligible changes in blood pressure was observed in the control state. The conscious rat was therefore able instantaneously to compensate for postural change. This ability, however, was blocked by guanethidine. The compound induced a dose-related hypotension and a further, dose-dependent drop in blood pressure on tilt. Hydralazine, on the other hand, induced only dose-dependent hypotension, but no change in blood pressure response from control tilts. Since these findings appear to be in accord with human clinical data, this rat model may be suitable for use in evaluating potential postural hypotensive activity of compounds.
