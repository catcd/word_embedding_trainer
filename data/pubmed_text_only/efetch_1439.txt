CAP1/Prss8 is a membrane-bound serine protease involved in the regulation of several different effectors, such as the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, the protease-activated receptor PAR2, the tight junction proteins, and the profilaggrin polypeptide. Recently, the V170D and the G54-P57 deletion mutations within the CAP1/Prss8 gene, identified in mouse frizzy (fr) and rat hairless (fr(CR)) animals, respectively, have been proposed to be responsible for their skin phenotypes. In the present study, we analyzed those mutations, revealing a change in the protein structure, a modification of the glycosylation state, and an overall reduction in the activation of ENaC of the two mutant proteins. In vivo analyses demonstrated that both fr and fr(CR) mutant animals present analogous reduction of embryonic viability, similar histologic aberrations at the level of the skin, and a significant decrease in the activity of ENaC in the distal colon compared with their control littermates. Hairless rats additionally had dehydration defects in skin and intestine and significant reduction in the body weight. In conclusion, we provided molecular and functional evidence that CAP1/Prss8 mutations are accountable for the defects in fr and fr(CR) animals, and we furthermore demonstrate a decreased function of the CAP1/Prss8 mutant proteins. Therefore, fr and fr(CR) animals are suitable models to investigate the consequences of CAP1/Prss8 action on its target proteins in the whole organism.
To report a seizure occurring secondary to meperidine treatment despite normal renal and central nervous system (CNS) function, and to provide a review of meperidine's role in pain management, including its use in pancreatitis and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.
A 55-year-old white woman with a history of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. On admission to the hospital, the serum creatinine level was 0.6 mg/dL with slightly elevated aspartate aminotransferase of 56 U/L (normal range 0-31) and alanine aminotransferase of 34 U/L (0-31). The patient received repeated and escalating doses of intravenous meperidine, resulting in a generalized seizure on day 4 of hospitalization. The accumulated meperidine dose was 2125 mg. Buprenorphine was substituted in place of meperidine, and the patient had no further reported complications. She was then transferred to a tertiary-care facility for sphincter of Oddi reevaluation. An objective causality assessment revealed the adverse drug event as probable.
Despite alternative opioids, meperidine continues to be used in pain management. Meperidine is different from other opioids because its active metabolite, normeperidine, is neurotoxic. Patients with renal insufficiency, liver failure, or CNS dysfunction are at increased risk for adverse drug reactions related to normeperidine accumulation. Due to normeperidine's extended half-life, however, accumulation of normeperidine can occur in any patient receiving repeated doses of meperidine.
This case demonstrates the potential hazards that exist when using meperidine in any patient. Meperidine's inherent risks of both undertreating pain and causing adverse drug reactions should prompt clinicians and health organizations to restrict its use in pain management. This restriction should not make exceptions to meperidine's traditional use in pancreatitis or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.
We report the case of a 72-year-old woman suffering from bone metastatic breast cancer and treated with continuous intravenous 5 fluorouracil (5FU) chemotherapy, who presented with a bilateral asymmetric anterior optic neuropathy (ON). A deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) was documented. Patients with DPD deficiency are at increased risk for developing unusual and/or severe toxicity to 5FU. We discuss the differential diagnosis of anterior ON and we suggest that 5FU can be responsible for optic nerve toxicity in patients with DPD deficiency.
The current standard of care for pancreatic cancer is weekly gemcitabine administered for 3 of 4 weeks with a 1-week break between treatment cycles. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)-driven regimens as such are often associated with toxicities. Recent studies demonstrated that frequent dosing of chemotherapeutic drugs at relatively lower doses in metronomic regimens also confers anti-tumour activity but with fewer side effects.
Herein, we evaluated the anti-tumour efficacy of metronomic vs MTD gemcitabine, and investigated their effects on the tumour microenvironment in two human pancreatic cancer xenografts established from two different patients.
Metronomic and MTD gemcitabine significantly reduced tumour volume in both xenografts. However, K(trans) values were higher in metronomic gemcitabine-treated tumours than in their MTD-treated counterparts, suggesting better tissue perfusion in the former. These data were further supported by tumour-mapping studies showing prominent decreases in hypoxia after metronomic gemcitabine treatment. Metronomic gemcitabine also significantly increased apoptosis in cancer-associated fibroblasts and induced greater reductions in the tumour levels of multiple pro-angiogenic factors, including EGF, IL-1alpha, IL-8, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1.
Metronomic dosing of gemcitabine is active in pancreatic cancer and is accompanied by pronounced changes in the tumour microenvironment.
The increasing usage of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets allows protection of millions of people from malaria infection. Monitoring studies should be planned during any wide-scale malaria control program integrating insecticide-treated materials, to evaluate their effects and effectiveness on epidemiologically relevant parameters. Such operational control interventions may be challenged by insecticide resistance spread within vector populations, as a result of wide insecticide pressure. A nationwide distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets was implemented throughout Niger in 2005. We studied the population genetic structure of major malaria vectors across Nigerien Sahel, and investigated potential effects of this large malaria control intervention. Wild-caught Anopheles gambiae sensu lato females from seven villages and two wet seasons were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci. The genetic diversity within both species appeared homogenous between villages and years. The estimated genetic differentiation among samples was very low within both species, indicating high gene flow across the area. An absence of differentiation was also found between 2005 and 2006 wet seasons, for all samples but one, showing that the net distribution did not impact significantly the genetic diversity and structure of vector populations in a single year. We provide valuable results participating to document effects of large malaria control programs, to maximize the efficiency of available tools in future interventions.
Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of morphine produced dose-dependent behavioural changes in rats, the highest dose producing violent tonic convulsions. Naloxone (up to 10 mg/kg i.p., or 100 micrograms i.c.v.) failed to reverse morphine-induced toxicity. The conventional anticonvulsant drugs also failed to offer protection to morphine-induced seizures. GABA-ergic substances, GABA, piracetam and diazepam, on the other hand, protected the animals against morphine-induced convulsions and toxicity. Similarly, clonidine pretreatment also had a protective action against morphine-induced convulsions.
Inositol plays a key role in dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and acetylcholine neurotransmission, and inositol treatment is reported to have beneficial effects in depression and anxiety. Therefore, a reduction in brain intracellular inositol levels could be a cause of some psychiatric disorders, such as depression or anxiety. To determine the behavioural consequences of inositol depletion, we studied the behaviour of sodium-dependent myo-inositol cotransporter-1 heterozygous knockout mice. In heterozygous mice, free inositol levels were reduced by 15% in the frontal cortex and by 25% in the hippocampus, but they did not differ from their wild-type littermates in cholinergic-mediated lithium-pilocarpine seizures, in the apomorphine-induced stereotypic climbing model of dopaminergic system function, in the Porsolt forced-swimming test model of depression, in amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, or in the elevated plus-maze model of anxiety. Reduction of brain inositol by more than 25% may be required to elicit neurobehavioural effects.
Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system leads to an accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartments. In the classical form it presents as neonatal apnea, intractable seizures, and hypotonia, followed by significant psychomotor retardation. An important subset of children with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous manner. This report describes a patient with mild language delay and mental retardation, who was found to have nonketotic hyperglycinemia following her presentation with acute encephalopathy and chorea shortly after initiation of valproate therapy.
Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is implicated in cisplatin ototoxicity. Activation of this channel by cisplatin increases reactive oxygen species generation, which contribute to loss of outer hair cells in the cochlea. Knockdown of TRPV1 by short interfering RNA protected against cisplatin ototoxicity. In this study, we examined the mechanism underlying TRPV1-mediated ototoxicity using cultured organ of Corti transformed cells (UB/OC-1) and rats. Trans-tympanic injections of capsaicin produced transient hearing loss within 24 h, which recovered by 72 h. In UB/OC-1 cells, capsaicin increased NOX3 NADPH oxidase activity and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Intratympanic administration of capsaicin transiently increased STAT1 activity and expression of downstream proinflammatory molecules. Capsaicin produced a transient increase in CD14-positive inflammatory cells into the cochlea, which mimicked the temporal course of STAT1 activation but did not alter the expression of apoptotic genes or damage to outer hair cells. In addition, trans-tympanic administration of STAT1 short interfering RNA protected against capsaicin-induced hearing loss. These data suggest that activation of TRPV1 mediates temporary hearing loss by initiating an inflammatory process in the cochlea via activation of NOX3 and STAT1. Thus, these proteins represent reasonable targets for ameliorating hearing loss.
Blood pressure and headache frequency were evaluated in normotensive male and female cocaine-dependent patients (N=43) participating in a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of amlodipine for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Amlodipine produced a significant reduction in both systolic (p=0.04) and diastolic (p=0.01) blood pressures without producing dizziness or faintness. Placebo subjects had about three times the frequency of headaches compared to the amlodipine-treated subjects (p=0.004). The high frequency of headaches reported by cocaine-dependent individuals was significantly reduced by amlodipine and may reflect improved cerebrovascular tone.
Electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO) is a 4Fe4S flavoprotein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It catalyzes ubiquinone (UQ) reduction by ETF, linking oxidation of fatty acids and some amino acids to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Deficiencies in ETF or ETF-QO result in multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, a human metabolic disease. Crystal structures of ETF-QO with and without bound UQ were determined, and they are essentially identical. The molecule forms a single structural domain. Three functional regions bind FAD, the 4Fe4S cluster, and UQ and are closely packed and share structural elements, resulting in no discrete structural domains. The UQ-binding pocket consists mainly of hydrophobic residues, and UQ binding differs from that of other UQ-binding proteins. ETF-QO is a monotopic integral membrane protein. The putative membrane-binding surface contains an alpha-helix and a beta-hairpin, forming a hydrophobic plateau. The UQ-flavin distance (8.5 A) is shorter than the UQ-cluster distance (18.8 A), and the very similar redox potentials of FAD and the cluster strongly suggest that the flavin, not the cluster, transfers electrons to UQ. Two possible electron transfer paths can be envisioned. First, electrons from the ETF flavin semiquinone may enter the ETF-QO flavin one by one, followed by rapid equilibration with the cluster. Alternatively, electrons may enter via the cluster, followed by equilibration between centers. In both cases, when ETF-QO is reduced to a two-electron reduced state (one electron at each redox center), the enzyme is primed to reduce UQ to ubiquinol via FAD.
Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are developmental toxicants in various animal classes, including birds. Both compounds interact with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), but it is not known whether activation of PPARs is involved in their embryo toxicity in birds. We exposed chicken embryos via egg injection at a late developmental stage to GW7647, a potent PPARα agonist in mammals, and to PFOS or PFOA. Mortality was induced by PFOS and PFOA but not by GW7647. Transcripts of a number of genes activated by PPARα agonists in mammals were analyzed in liver and kidney of 18-day-old embryos. Several of the genes were induced in both liver and kidney following exposure to GW7647. Treatment with PFOA resulted in induction of acyl-coenzyme A oxidase mRNA in liver, whereas none of the genes were significantly induced by PFOS treatment. No up-regulation of gene transcription was found in kidney following treatment with PFOS or PFOA. Principal component analysis showed that PFOA caused an mRNA expression pattern in liver more similar to the pattern induced by GW7647 than PFOS did. Our findings do not support that the embryo mortality by PFOS and PFOA in chicken embryos involves PPARα activation.
Linezolid has been associated with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Mechanisms for neither have been elucidated.
To propose mechanisms for linezolid-induced anemia and thrombocytopenia.
A 78-year-old white woman with Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis was treated with linezolid after developing resistance to multiple antibiotic regimens. After 7 days of linezolid therapy, she developed thrombocytopenia, while an anemia present since admission remained unchanged. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, primarily looking for a mechanism for the thrombocytopenia. Histopathology revealed adequate megakaryocytes, ringed sideroblasts, and vacuolated pronormoblasts. A course of immune globulin (IVIG) was administered, with slowing in the rate of decline in platelets. She died 24 hours after her last dose of IVIG of congestive heart failure.
The presence of ringed sideroblasts and vacuolated pronormoblasts suggests that linezolid-induced anemia is secondary to a chloramphenicol-like suppression of erythropoiesis. The presence of adequate, normal-appearing megakaryocytes suggests immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, not marrow suppression. Although the response to IVIG is difficult to interpret because of the patient's death, there was a slowing in the rate of decline of the platelet count, further supporting immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. An objective causality assessment indicated that the adverse drug event was probably due to linezolid.
There appear to be 2 distinct mechanisms for linezolid-induced cytopenias. While anemia is reversible and manageable with transfusions, thrombocytopenia can be a treatment-limiting toxicity. The ability to treat through an immune-mediated cytopenia with IVIG may be beneficial for critically ill patients with few therapeutic options.
Long-term administration of chloroquine to rats induces a vacuolar myopathy, which is specifically termed chloroquine myopathy (CM). In CM, tau mRNA levels were transiently upregulated in the early phase, while tau itself slowly accumulated in the late phase. The temporal profiles of tau mRNA levels and its accumulation were very similar to those of beta-amyloid protein precursor (APP) and its carboxyl-terminal fragments, both of which have been known to be degraded in lysosomes. Immunocytochemistry showed that tau progressively accumulated in the rimmed vacuoles exhibiting increased acid phosphatase activities, and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that tau was located within autophagic vacuoles. These results suggest that the accumulation of tau in CM is due to defective tau degradation in the lysosomal compartment in the muscle.
(1) Ribavirin is licensed for patients with hepatitis C who have not been treated previously or who have relapsed. According to the licence, ribavirin must be combined with interferon alfa-2b. (2) The clinical file is bulky and of acceptable methodological quality. (3) Some trials have shown that ribavirin monotherapy has no effect on viral load. Two trials involving patients who had relapsed after transaminase normalisation on interferon alfa-2b monotherapy show that the ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b combination is more effective than interferon alfa-2b alone in rendering viraemia undetectable and normalising transaminase activity for at least 6 months after treatment cessation. (4) A trial of patients resistant to interferon alfa monotherapy showed that it was more beneficial to combine ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b than to double the dose of interferon alfa-2b alone, in terms of driving viraemia below the detection limit and persistently normalising transaminase activity. (5) Three trials involving patients who had not been treated previously showed that the ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b combination was more effective than interferon alfa-2b monotherapy in driving viraemia below the detection limit for at least 6 months after treatment cessation, and in reducing the liver inflammation score. No effect on fibrosis or on the risk of cirrhosis has yet been demonstrated. (6) The best duration of treatment is not known, but seems to depend on prognostic factors. The following factors might permit shorter treatment: relatively low viral load, early-stage fibrosis, female sex, age below 40 years, and infection by genotype 2 or 3 strains. (7) The ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b combination causes haemolytic anaemia in most patients, and this can be severe. (8) Ribavirin is teratogenic and causes sperm defects.
We evaluated Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in hippocampus of rats submitted to an animal model of mania which included the use of lithium and valproate. In the acute treatment, amphetamine or saline was administered to rats for 14 days, between day 8 and 14, rats were treated with lithium, valproate or saline. In the maintenance treatment, rats were treated with lithium, valproate or saline, between day 8 and 14, amphetamine or saline were administered. Locomotor activity was assessed by open field test and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity was measured. Our results showed that mood stabilizers reversed and prevented amphetamine-induced behavioral effects. Moreover, amphetamine (acute treatment) increased Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity, and administration of lithium or valproate reversed this effect. In the maintenance treatment, amphetamine increased Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in saline-pretreated rats. Amphetamine administration in lithium- or valproate-pretreated animals did not alter Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. The findings suggest that amphetamine-induced hyperactivity may be associated with an increase in Na(+),K(+)-ATPase.
Major bleeding is a frequent and hazardous complication associated with thromboprophylaxis using vitamin-K antagonists (VKA). Suggested regimens for control of highly elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR) and hemorrhagic events during VKA treatment include administration of vitamin K, infusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or a prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). In contrast, this communication present the first report on the efficacious use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) as additional therapy in seven patients presenting with central nervous system (CNS) bleeding emergencies. Pre-treatment INRs ranged from 1.7 to 6.6, and 10 min after a single dose of rFVIIa (10-40 microg/kg) all INRs were </= 1.5. Six patients underwent drainage of the CNS hematoma and all patients survived. No untoward biochemical signs of coagulation activation were detected and no incidence of thromboembolism was observed. In ex-vivo experimental studies, profiles of continuous whole blood clot formation were evaluated by thrombelastography in 25 patients on VKA treatment (INR 1.7-4.3), demonstrating a significantly prolonged initiation phase and diminished propagation of clot formation. Ex-vivo supplementation with rFVIIa to blood of six patients returned a distinct reduction of the prolonged initiation but variable changes in the maximum velocity of clot formation. The ex-vivo experiments and our clinical data support recent suggestions that rFVIIa might substitute for infusion of FFP or PCC in acute reversal of VKA treatment.
Nutritional assessments were measured in the sixteen long-term survivors who had undergone a massive resection of more than two-thirds of the small intestine or less than 170 cm of the remaining small intestine. Prealbumin, retinol binding protein and zinc in serum and arm muscle circumference were significantly lower than the normal range. Serum albumin had a tendency to correlate to the length of the remaining small intestine. Nutritional risk index had a correlation with the length of the remaining small intestine. In this study, nutritional assessments in the patients with a massive resection of the small intestine indicated to be in preclinical malnutritional state. This may support that supplementary nutritional therapy is necessary for such patients. In addition, we reported a patient with sensory polyneuropathy caused by vitamin E deficiency due to short bowel syndrome. The level of vitamin E was low in his serum, 294 micrograms/dl (normal: 1004 +/- 65) and in his red blood cells, 136 micrograms/dl (normal: 176 +/- 9). His symptom was markedly decreased within two weeks after the administration of large doses of vitamin E.
Antioxidant therapy may be useful in diseases with impaired oxidant-antioxidant balance such as pulmonary fibrosis. This study was designed to examine the effects of resveratrol, an antioxidant agents, against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and oxidative damage. Wistar albino rats were administered a single dose of bleomycin (5 mg/kg; via the tracheal cannula) followed by either saline or resveratrol (10 mg/kg; orally) for 14 days. The effect of resveratrol on pulmonary oxidative damage was studied by cell count and analysis of cytokine levels (TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and biochemical measurements of malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation; glutathione (GSH), a key antioxidant; and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, an index of neutrophil infiltration, in the lung tissue. Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis was determined by lung collagen contents and also microscopically. Bleomycin caused a significant decrease in lung GSH, which was accompanied with significant increases in MDA level, MPO activity, and collagen contents of the lung tissue concomitant with increased levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators and cell count in BALF. On the other hand, resveratrol treatment reversed all these biochemical indices as well as histopathological alterations induced by bleomycin. The results demonstrate the role of oxidative mechanisms in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and resveratrol, by its antioxidant properties, ameliorates oxidative injury and fibrosis due to bleomycin. Thus, an effective supplement with resveratrol as an adjuvant therapy may be a very promising agent in alleviating the side effects of bleomycin, an effective chemotherapeutic agent.
The present study examines the motor responses of 10- to 12-month-old, male C57 mice that were either given intraperitoneal (IP) injections of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 30 mg/kg per day) or vehicle for 10 consecutive days, followed by IP injections of levodopa (200 mg/kg) plus carbidopa (25 mg/kg). Five days of MPTP exposure resulted in the Straub tail phenomenon and pronounced hypokinesia. However, during the next 5 days, motor activity returned to baseline, even with continued MPTP treatment. After 10 to 14 days of rest, all mice were then treated with levodopa/carbidopa twice daily for multiple, consecutive days. However, only the previously MPTP-treated animals became hyperkinetic, as compared to levodopa-treated control animals that were not previously exposed to MPTP. Abnormal activity included scratching, running, gnawing, and jumping movements. Hyperactivity lasted for approximately 2 hours after each levodopa injection and then returned to baseline, but the amount of hyperkinesia increased with additional days of levodopa treatment, even though the daily levodopa dose was not changed. These results demonstrate that levodopa can cause reproducible hyperactivity in mice that were previously exposed to MPTP.
Baroreceptor-heart rate reflex sensitivity is decreased in congestive heart failure. The reflex control of heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity in rats with chronic volume overload, an established model for moderate heart failure, is still unknown. Therefore, we investigated the regulation of humoral and neuronal sympathetic activity and the baroreflex control of heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity in conscious, unrestrained rats with aortocaval shunt. Rats with aortocaval shunts had larger hearts (388 +/- 11 vs. 277 +/- 4 mg/100 g body wt), elevated central venous pressures (14 +/- 4 vs. 4 +/- 3 mmHg), and higher atrial natriuretic peptide plasma levels (87 +/- 16 vs. 25 +/- 3 pmol/l) than controls but had similar systemic blood pressure and heart rate values. Plasma epinephrine (0.63 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.08 pmol/l, P < 0.05) and norepinephrine concentrations (0.27 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.02 pmol/l, P < 0.05) were elevated in shunted rats compared with controls. Nitroprusside-induced hypotension led to a significantly greater increase in efferent splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity in shunted rats than in controls (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.6 microV, P < 0.05), whereas the heart rate responses were not different between the groups. These results indicate that the regulation of the autonomic nervous system is altered in chronically volume-overloaded rats. The arterial baroreflex control of efferent splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity was dissociated from the control of heart rate. Therefore, analysis of the activation of sympathetic nervous system assessed by direct measurements of efferent sympathetic nerve activity appears to be more sensitive for the detection of altered autonomic nervous system function than the analysis of baroreflex control of heart rate.
In a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled crossover study, we characterized how terbutaline prolonged cardiac corrected QT interval (QTc). The study was carried out in six young and healthy male subjects in supine position. Escalating terbutaline doses were administered intravenously at infusion rates of 6 mL/h (10 microg terbutaline/min), 12 mL/h (20 microg terbutaline/min), and 18 mL/h (30 microg terbutaline/min). Terbutaline maximally prolonged QTc intervals on average by 60%, from 358 milliseconds (SD 28) to 456 milliseconds (SD 19). The effect was closely associated with a simultaneous decrease in plasma potassium concentration from 4.0 mmol/L (SD 0.1) to 2.5 mmol/L (SD 0.1). The final phase of slow ventricular repolarization, the interval between the apex and the end of T wave, was proven to be highly sensitive to the hypokalemic terbutaline actions, whereas the earlier repolarization phases were not strongly affected by terbutaline. Estimated by using the classic Nernst equation for membrane potentials, terbutaline-induced hypokalemia hyperpolarized ventricular myocardium from the resting level of -90 mV to -110 mV. The prolongation of QTc interval was related to ventricular hyperpolarization with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91. Terbutaline-induced prolongation of QTc interval in healthy volunteers is in conformity with repolarization studies carried out in isolated canine heart ventricular preparations in which the cardiac ventricular cell membrane potential determines the duration of the final phase of slow ventricular repolarization.
Topical application of coal tar is one of the oldest therapies for atopic dermatitis (AD), a T helper 2 (Th2) lymphocyte-mediated skin disease associated with loss-of-function mutations in the skin barrier gene, filaggrin (FLG). Despite its longstanding clinical use and efficacy, the molecular mechanism of coal tar therapy is unknown. Using organotypic skin models with primary keratinocytes from AD patients and controls, we found that coal tar activated the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), resulting in induction of epidermal differentiation. AHR knockdown by siRNA completely abrogated this effect. Coal tar restored filaggrin expression in FLG-haploinsufficient keratinocytes to wild-type levels, and counteracted Th2 cytokine-mediated downregulation of skin barrier proteins. In AD patients, coal tar completely restored expression of major skin barrier proteins, including filaggrin. Using organotypic skin models stimulated with Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, we found coal tar to diminish spongiosis, apoptosis, and CCL26 expression, all AD hallmarks. Coal tar interfered with Th2 cytokine signaling via dephosphorylation of STAT6, most likely due to AHR-regulated activation of the NRF2 antioxidative stress pathway. The therapeutic effect of AHR activation herein described opens a new avenue to reconsider AHR as a pharmacological target and could lead to the development of mechanism-based drugs for AD.
The E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2 (encoded by the Nedd4L gene) regulates the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC/SCNN1) to mediate Na+ homeostasis. Mutations in the human β/γENaC subunits that block NEDD4-2 binding or constitutive ablation of exons 6-8 of Nedd4L in mice both result in salt-sensitive hypertension and elevated ENaC activity (Liddle syndrome). To determine the role of renal tubular NEDD4-2 in adult mice, we generated tetracycline-inducible, nephron-specific Nedd4L KO mice. Under standard and high-Na+ diets, conditional KO mice displayed decreased plasma aldosterone but normal Na+/K+ balance. Under a high-Na+ diet, KO mice exhibited hypercalciuria and increased blood pressure, which were reversed by thiazide treatment. Protein expression of βENaC, γENaC, the renal outer medullary K+ channel (ROMK), and total and phosphorylated thiazide-sensitive Na+Cl- cotransporter (NCC) levels were increased in KO kidneys. Unexpectedly, Scnn1a mRNA, which encodes the αENaC subunit, was reduced and proteolytic cleavage of αENaC decreased. Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of NEDD4-2 in adult renal tubules causes a new form of mild, salt-sensitive hypertension without hyperkalemia that is characterized by upregulation of NCC, elevation of β/γENaC, but not αENaC, and a normal Na+/K+ balance maintained by downregulation of ENaC activity and upregulation of ROMK.
Two cancer patients are reported, who presented with altered consciousness 2 and 3 months, respectively, after the administration of 5-fluorouracil derivatives, and progressed to a state of akinetic mutism. At first a presumptive diagnosis of metastatic brain tumor was made. However, the result of a cerebrospinal fluid cytology for malignancy was negative, and computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed diffuse decreased attenuation of the cerebral white matter, indicative of leukoencephalopathy, without association of mass lesion. Upon discontinuing the drugs, both patients made significant recovery and the decreased attenuation on the CT also disappeared. The significance of the early diagnosis of this pathology is emphasized.
