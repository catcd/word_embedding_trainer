Melamine paper is a basic material used in the furniture industry for home and office interiors. Contact allergic dermatitis from melamine formaldehyde resins (MFRs) should be considered in patients who work on melamine paper impregnation lines. We report a case of a 28-year-old female plywood worker who developed eczema on the dorsal side of her hands and wrists after 2 years of working on the melamine paper impregnation line. She had a relevant positive patch-test reaction to MFR, with a negative reaction to formaldehyde. Contact dermatitis due to MFR is not common, and it is usually related to products that are not fully cured or to close contact with intermediate products on the assembly line. Formaldehyde release from MFR can explain most of the positive responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MFR contact allergic dermatitis in a worker on a melamine paper impregnation line.
In conclusion, we observed first that nifedipine is highly efficacious in preventing the coronary vasospasm of Prinzmetal's variant angina. Secondly, nifedipine appears to be efficacious in preventing episodes of recurrent rest angina following an acute myocardial infarction. Although coronary vasospasm has not been clearly documented in patients with recurrent rest angina after infarction, a primary decrease in coronary blood flow is the most likely cause of this syndrome since the ischemia occurs at rest, at a time when myocardial oxygen demands are not elevated. In this highly unstable group of patients with coronary disease nifedipine may eliminate the need for bypass surgery or may provide clinical stability prior to more elective cardiac catheterization and surgery.
Gliomas were induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by continuous exposure to 100 ppm of N-nitrosmethylurea (MNU) in drinking water. Latency periods for such tumors were 20 and 50 weeks following completion of exposure intervals of 20, 15, and 10 weeks, respectively. Based on histomorphology and the pattern of GFAP immunoreactivity, a large percentage of MNU-induced tumors (>40%) were anaplastic mixed gliomas, having both neoplastic astrocytic and oligodendroglial components. Typical oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas also occurred less frequently. Unlike the majority of tumors induced by ethylnitrosourea (ENU), MNU yielded glial tumors that did not express synaptophysin. Anaplastic mixed gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs) had no missense p53 mutations in the commonly mutated exons 4 through 8 and did not overexpress wild-type p53, suggesting that MNU-induced oncogenesis in rat brain tumors may not require inactivation/alteration of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The K-ras gene was also analyzed and found to have no activating mutations in brain tumors. This model is suitable for studying genetic events leading to the majority of gliomas that apparently express functional p53.
A 25-year-old female developed causalgia following a nerve injury in the left hand, and this was treated successfully with a series of intravenous guanethidine blocks. However, after the 13th block, systolic arterial blood pressure decreased to 60 mmHg and remained low (80 mmHg) for one week. Accumulation of guanethidine at the sympathetic nerve ending, resulting in autonomic denervation, might be the underlying mechanism of the prolonged hypotension. Treatment was conservative; however, the use of tricyclic antidepressants and sympathomimetic amines to restore the blood pressure to a normal level can be considered with appropriate caution.
The average doubling times of HL60 cells grown in the presence of 0,5,10 and 100 microM 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) for 72 h were, respectively, 51.1, 65.7, 69.0 and 76.3 h. This drug-concentration-dependent prolongation of the cell-doubling time was associated with a progressive increase in modal cell volume. The technique of combined Feulgen microspectrophotometry and 3H-thymidine autoradiography revealed that the cell cycle distribution of HL60 cells cultured in the presence of 5 and 100 microM AZT for 48 h was abnormal, with an increased percentage of cells in the S phase and a decreased percentage in the G1phase. From the cell doubling times and the cell cycle distribution data, and making a number of assumptions, upper limit estimates for the duration of the S phase in cultures containing 0,5 and 100 microM AZT were calculated to be 26.2, 35.8 and 49.6 h, respectively. The data indicate that concentrations of AZT achieved in the plasma of patients receiving this drug (i.e. 5 microM) cause a substantial prolongation of both the cell cycle time and the duration of the S phase of HL60 cells. It therefore seems likely that some of the toxic effects of AZT seen in vivo, including impairment of bone marrow function, are at least partly related to AZT-induced disturbances of DNA synthesis and proliferation in human cells.
Rubber materials are common causes of contact dermatitis. Neoprene is a special synthetic rubber used in many products (eg, wet suits, elastic supports, gloves, shoes, and orthopedic devices). A 31-year-old man was admitted to our dermatoallergologic clinic with the development of a generalized itching erythematovesicular eruption. He reported that clinical manifestations occurred after he wore a neoprene wet suit that he was used to wearing for water sports. Although allergic contact dermatitis from a wet suit is not uncommon, it is usually due to thiourea derivatives whereas our patient presented with contact allergy to p-tert-butylphenol formaldehyde resin and zinc diethyldithiocarbamate.
Mercury, an occupational and environmental contaminant, is a well-recognized health hazard. The thymus is a target for inorganic mercury (Hg2+); thymic function is impaired in Hg2+ intoxication and is partially restored by simultaneous L-arginine supplementation. The nitric oxide (NO)-nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway and metallothioneins (MTs) were studied to investigate the role of L-arginine in thymic function restoration after mercury exposure. Mice received a higher and a lower dose of inorganic mercury, with and without L-arginine supplementation. Saline-treated mice were used as controls. Thymus weight and thymulin were measured as indices of thymic function. Mice treated with Hg2+ alone displayed an accumulation of metal in the thymus, reduced NOS activity, a lower plasma nitrite plus nitrate concentration and an increased MTs expression compared with control mice. L-arginine supplementation was associated with lower Hg2+ concentrations in the organ and partial preservation of other measures. Reduced accumulation of Hg2+ in mice dosed with L-arginine was probably related to greater NO production and NO-MTs interactions.
Zinc deficiency, cell-mediated immune dysfunction, susceptibility to infections, and increased oxidative stress have been observed in elderly subjects (ie, those >55 y old). Zinc is an effective antiinflammatory and antioxidant agent.
The primary objective was to determine the effect of zinc on the incidence of total infections in healthy elderly subjects. The secondary objective was to determine the effect of zinc on cytokines and oxidative stress markers.
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of zinc supplementation was conducted in elderly subjects. Fifty healthy subjects of both sexes aged 55-87 y and inclusive of all ethnic groups were recruited for this study from a senior center. The zinc-supplemented group received zinc gluconate (45 mg elemental Zn/d) orally for 12 mo. Incidence of infections during the supplementation period was documented. The generation of inflammatory cytokines, T helper 1 and T helper 2 cytokines, and oxidative stress markers and the plasma concentrations of zinc were measured at baseline and after supplementation.
Compared with a group of younger adults, at baseline the older subjects had significantly lower plasma zinc, higher ex vivo generation of inflammatory cytokines and interleukin 10, and higher plasma oxidative stress markers and endothelial cell adhesion molecules. The incidence of infections and ex vivo generation of tumor necrosis factor alpha and plasma oxidative stress markers were significantly lower in the zinc-supplemented than in the placebo group. Plasma zinc and phytohemagglutin-induced interleukin 2 mRNA in isolated mononuclear cells were significantly higher in the zinc-supplemented than in the placebo group.
After zinc supplementation, the incidence of infections was significantly lower, plasma zinc was significantly higher, and generation of tumor necrosis factor alpha and oxidative stress markers was significantly lower in the zinc-supplemented than in the placebo group.
Mutations in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor II (BMPR2) are associated with the apoptosis of the pulmonary artery endothelial cells and the loss of the pulmonary small vessels. The present study was designed to investigate the involvement of BMPR2 in the protective effect of fluoxetine against monocrotaline (MCT)-induced endothelial apoptosis in rats. Models of pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats were established by a single intraperitoneal injection of MCT (60 mg/kg). Fluoxetine (2 and 10 mg/kg) was intragastrically administered once a day. After 21 days, MCT caused pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary vascular remodeling and significantly reduced the BMPR2 expression in lungs and pulmonary arteries. Fluoxetine dose-dependently inhibited MCT-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension and effectively protected the lungs against MCT-induced endothelial apoptosis, reduction in the number of alveolar sacs, and loss of the pulmonary small vessels. Fluoxetine reversed the expression of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent kinase І, BMPR2, phospho-Smad1, β-catenin, and reduced the expression of caspase 3 in rat lungs. These findings suggest that BMPR2 is probably involved in the protective effect of fluoxetine against MCT-induced endothelial apoptosis in rats.
Molecular targeted cancer therapy mediated by nanoparticles (NPs) is a promising strategy to overcome the lack of specificity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. In this context, the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has demonstrated a powerful potential for the management of prostate cancer (PCa). Cancer chemoprevention by phytochemicals is emerging as a suitable approach for the treatment of early carcinogenic processes. Since (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) has shown potent chemopreventive efficacy for PCa, we designed and developed novel targeted NPs in order to selectively deliver EGCG to cancer cells. Herein, to explore the recent concept of "nanochemoprevention", we present a study on EGCG-loaded NPs consisting of biocompatible polymers, functionalized with small molecules targeting PSMA, that exhibited a selective in vitro efficacy against PSMA-expressing PCa cells. This approach could be beneficial for high risk patients and would fulfill a significant therapeutic need, thus opening new perspectives for novel and effective treatment for PCa.
As part of our research for novel calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) antagonists that can function as oral bone anabolic agents, we recently reported the discovery of a tetrahydropyrazolopyrimidine derivative featuring adamantyl group 1b with potent CaSR antagonistic activity. To explore the potential of this calcilytic congener, we introduced the gem-dialkyl benzyl group at the 3-position of the tetrahydropyrazolopyrimidine ring, forming a bioisostere of the adamantyl group by mimicking the adamantyl group's lipophilicity and bulkiness. Optimization directed toward the improvement of solubility and metabolic stability led to the discovery of compound 9e, which stimulated transient PTH secretion when orally administered to normal rats. Further, compound 9e proved to be fully effective in an osteopenic ovariectomized rat model.
Hepatocyte-specific NEMO/NF-κB deleted mice (NEMO(Δhepa)) develop spontaneous non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Free fatty acids and bile acids promote DR5 expression. TRAIL/NK cell-mediated activation of TRAIL-R2/DR5 plays an important role during acute injury in NEMO(Δhepa) mice.
To inhibit the progression of NASH in the absence of hepatocyte-NEMO/NF-kB signaling.
NEMOf/f and NEMO(Δhepa) mice were fed with a low-fat diet, and with two anticholestatic diets; UDCA and NorUDCA. The impact of these treatments on the progression of NASH was evaluated.
We show that high expression of DR5 in livers from NEMO(Δhepa) mice is accompanied by an abundant presence of bile acids (BAs), misregulation of BA transporters and significant alteration of lipid metabolism-related genes. Additionally, mice lacking NEMO in hepatocytes spontaneously showed ductular response at young age. Unexpectedly, feeding of NEMO(Δhepa) mice with low-fat diet failed to improve chronic liver injury. Conversely, anti-cholestatic treatment with nor-ursodeoxycholic acid (NorUDCA), but not with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), led to a significant attenuation of liver damage in NEMO(Δhepa) mice. The strong therapeutic effect of NorUDCA relied on a significant downregulation of LXR-dependent lipogenesis and the normalisation of BA metabolism through mechanisms involving cross-talk between Cyp7a1 and SHP. This was associated with the significant improvement of liver histology, NEMO(Δhepa)/NorUDCA-treated mice showed lower apoptosis and reduced CyclinD1 expression, indicating attenuation of the compensatory proliferative response to hepatocellular damage. Finally, fibrosis and ductular reaction markers were significantly reduced in NorUDCA-treated NEMO(Δhepa) mice.
Overall, our work demonstrates the contribution of bile acids metabolism to the progression of NASH in the absence of hepatocyte-NF-kB through mechanisms involving DR5-apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Our work suggests a potential therapeutic effect of NorUDCA in attenuating the progression of NASH.
This paper's findings suggest that an arbitrary Chinese policy that greatly increases total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution is causing the 500 million residents of Northern China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of life expectancy. The quasi-experimental empirical approach is based on China's Huai River policy, which provided free winter heating via the provision of coal for boilers in cities north of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. Using a regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, we find that ambient concentrations of TSPs are about 184 μg/m(3) [95% confidence interval (CI): 61, 307] or 55% higher in the north. Further, the results indicate that life expectancies are about 5.5 y (95% CI: 0.8, 10.2) lower in the north owing to an increased incidence of cardiorespiratory mortality. More generally, the analysis suggests that long-term exposure to an additional 100 μg/m(3) of TSPs is associated with a reduction in life expectancy at birth of about 3.0 y (95% CI: 0.4, 5.6).
A case of acute interstitial nephritis caused by sodium valproate is reported. The sodium valproate treatment was continued after initial diagnosis and the patient developed end-stage renal failure. After transplantation, interstitial nephritis was demonstrated in the renal graft.
The authors had the opportunity to follow a case of fatal ischemic bilateral cerebral infarctus which occurred in a 28 year old female with a history of migraine (but without any anti-migrainous drug). She had been using a low dose (0.05 mg ethinyl estradiol) oral contraceptive (OC) for 2 years. The previous pathological data of subendothelial thickening and fibrosis with thrombosis were confirmed, but for the 1st time, a marked giant cell reaction was found in close contact with lesions of the internal elastic membrane. Thus, there was evidence of inflammatory thrombo-angeitis obliterans. Biological and immunological abnormalities such as a high rate of anti-ethinyl estradiol antibodies in the serum (polyclonal immunoglobulin IgC) and circulating blood immune complexes seem to be closely related to this inflammatory thrombo-angeitis. These biological and histological findings suggest that vascular accidents related to OCs may be induced by an immunological mechanism. (author's)
Benzylparaben (BzP), a type of parabens being used as a preservative agent in cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical products, may be ingested by humans. In this study, we performed an immature uterotrophic assay using Sprague Dawley (SD) rats by intragastric administration to determine the estrogenic effects of BzP and found significant increases in uterine weight with doses of 0.16 mg/kg body weight and higher (P<0.05). The in vivo estrogenicity of BzP was supported by in vitro results from the human estrogen receptor α (hERα)-coactivator recruiting assay and in silico molecular docking analysis performed in this study. The in vitro estrogenic activity of BzP can be observed at concentrations of 1.0×10(-8) M and higher. Molecular docking analysis showed that BzP fits well into the agonist pocket of hERα. The lowest observed effect dose (LOED) (0.16 mg/kg/day) of BzP is much lower than the documented LOEDs of other parabens. Actual risk may exist for people who consume a diet high in BzP or use BzP-laden cosmetics. In addition, we tested the sensitivity of Wistar rats to 17β-estradiol by immature uterotrophic assay, and no obvious uterotrophic response was observed in the rats given doses up to 100 μg/kg body weight.
Keap1 regulates Nrf2 activity in response to xenobiotic and oxidative stresses. Nrf2 is an essential regulator of cytoprotective genes. Keap1-null mice are lethal by weaning age due to malnutrition caused by severe hyperkeratosis of the upper digestive tract. Analysis of Keap1::Nrf2 double mutant mice revealed that currently recognizable phenotypes of Keap1-null mice are all attributable to constitutive activation of Nrf2. We previously reported that hepatocyte-specific Keap1 knockout (Keap1(flox/-)::Albumin-Cre) mice are viable and more resistant to acute toxicity of acetaminophen (APAP). In the current study, we found that the floxed Keap1 allele is hypomorphic and that Keap1 expression was decreased in all examined tissues of Keap1(flox/-) mice. Taking advantage of the hypomorphic phenotype of Keap1(flox/-) mice, we examined the effects of graded reduction of Keap1 expression in adult mice. When challenged with APAP, Keap1(flox/-) mice were more protected from mortality than wild-type and even Keap1(flox/-)::Albumin-Cre mice. In contrast, a decrease in Keap1 levels to less than 50% resulted in increased mortality in a study of 2-year-old mice. These results support our contention that the benefits of Nrf2 activation in acute toxicity are hormetic and that constitutive Nrf2 activation beyond a certain threshold is rather disadvantageous to long-term survival.
Methadone is commonly used in opiate detoxification in high dose. It has a molecular structure similar to verapamil and has been reported to cause similar side effects with continuous high-dose infusion. We report the case of a patient with a history of addiction and abuse of alprazolam and hydrocodone who developed sinus bradycardia after being started on oral methadone for detoxification. The potential of methadone to cause side effects similar to verapamil must be considered in any patient taking methadone.
Lumbar radiculographs were obtained in 252 patients with suspected disk herniation. Fifteen patients who underwent previous radiculography with Dimer-X plus Depo-Medrol exhibited adhesive arachnoiditis. This was not observed in 6 patients who received Dimer-X alone. No positive correlation between radiological diagnosis of adhesive arachnoiditis and clinical symptoms can be demonstrated. The authors suggest that steroids not be used intrathecally in combination with water-soluble contrast media.
To know whether the application of patient-controlled analgesia devices could be avoided if intrathecal morphine is given in combination with spinal anaesthesia.
In a randomized, double-blind multicentre study, 188 orthopaedic patients were randomized to receive intrathecally placebo, 0.1 mg morphine or 0.2 mg morphine in addition to 15 mg bupivacaine. The primary outcome parameter was the number of patients without any additional request for opioid during a period of 72 h after surgery.
Patients with 0.1 or 0.2 mg morphine showed a significant reduction in opioid requests compared with placebo during 72 h after surgery (P = 0.0001). At 24 h after surgery, the rate of patients who required additional opioid analgesia was 71% in the placebo group, 51% in the 0.1 mg morphine group and 31% of the patients in the 0.2 mg morphine group. After 0.2 mg morphine, systemic opioid requirements at 24 h were significantly lower than those in patients with 0.1 mg morphine (P < 0.05). Intrathecal morphine was not associated with an increased frequency of respiratory depression. Forty per cent of patients with intrathecal morphine did not ask for systemic opioids.
Intrathecal morphine in a dose of 0.1 and 0.2 mg provides effective analgesia for up to 48 h without any need for systemic opioids at all in many patients.
We isolated the human adipose-specific and most abundant gene transcript, apM1 (Maeda, K., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 221, 286-289, 1996). The apM1 gene product was a kind of soluble matrix protein, which we named adiponectin. To quantitate the plasma adiponectin concentration, we have produced monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for human adiponectin and developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system. Adiponectin was abundantly present in the plasma of healthy volunteers in the range from 1.9 to 17.0 mg/ml. Plasma concentrations of adiponectin in obese subjects were significantly lower than those in non-obese subjects, although adiponectin is secreted only from adipose tissue. The ELISA system developed in this study will be useful for elucidating the physiological and pathophysiological role of adiponectin in humans.
Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor which reduces both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the parietal cell enzyme H(+)-K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase. Typical adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors are nausea, diarrhea, constipation and endocrinologic abnormalities such as gynecomastia. Cutaneous side effects are rare but may include contact dermatitis, lichenoid eruption, leukocytoclastic vasculitis or toxic epidermal necrolysis; anaphylaxis is rare. We identified omeprazole as the causative agent by oral challenge test in a patient who had developed anaphylaxis while taking several drugs.
In the face of the recent introduction of beta-blockers and calcium inhibitors, the author examines the role of Amiodarone, Perhexiline and Molsidomine in the treatment of angina pectoris. Amiodarone, introduced in 1967, remains a very useful anti-anginal drug. The beta and alpha-sympathetic inhibition it produces, makes it effective in effort and resting angina. It is particularly useful in anginal patients with arrhythmias as it has a potent anti-arrhythmic effect at all levels. It can be used in patients with bronchial asthma, in elderly patients and in cardiac failure. However, it may give risk to hypo or hyperthyroidism and so, should not be used in patients with a history or thyroid disorders. Perhexiline has been used in France since 1973 and is a second-line drug to be used in cases of intolerance or contraindications to other anti-anginal drugs. It is effective but may cause severe, undesirable hepatic and neurological complications. These side effects are however rare at low doses. Molsidomine, a more recent molecule, has an action similar to that of the nitrate derivatives: it mainly reduces left ventricular preload. It has a slower onset of action than the classical nitrate derivatives but its duration of action seems to be longer; Molsidomine and betablockade can be a useful therapeutic association.
In the further development of CNS dopamine autoreceptor active compounds related to 3-PPP, the transfused 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,10b-octahydrobenzo(f)quinoline HW-165 and its enantiomers were synthesised. This paper describes the basic pharmacological properties of these latter, novel "atypical" dopaminergic agents, based on an extensive series of biochemical and behavioural experiments in rats. By and large, the pharmacological activities of HW-165 - essentially, if not exclusively, residing in its (4aS,10bS)-(-)-enantiomer - were similar to those displayed by (S)-(-)-3-PPP, indicating the simultaneous presence of central dopamine (autoreceptor) agonist and weak (postsynaptic) antagonist properties in the molecule. Thus, in non-pretreated animals HW-165 and its active species monotonically suppressed the spontaneous locomotion without causing catalepsy or other appreciable motor disabilities, and at the same time selectively reduced the dopamine synthesis, release/turnover and utilisation. Some differences in these biochemical responses to HW-165 [racemate or (-)-enantiomer] were, however, noted in the limbic vs. striatal brain areas (e.g. decrease of dopamine synthesis particularly in the limbic parts). On the other hand, while failing to reverse reserpine-induced akinesia or to elicit stereotyped behaviour, the agents markedly inhibited the dopamine synthesis in either of the dopamine-dominated cerebral regions in the reserpinised as well as in gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)-treated rats. As shown for racemic HW-165 after reserpine pretreatment, the inhibition of dopamine synthesis was completely and stereoselectively blocked by (+)-butaclamol, thereby supporting direct dopamine receptor interaction. Racemic HW-165 readily antagonised the d-amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity. Apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was, however, distinctly more resistant to antagonism by HW-165 [racemate or (-)-enantiomer]. Moreover, the latter agents fully prevented the apomorphine-induced inhibition of striatal dopamine synthesis in otherwise non-pretreated rats, while only partly counteracting this effect of apomorphine in the limbic regions of such animals, and in either brain area of rats treated with gamma-butyro-lactone. The findings are interpreted within the context of the mixed dopamine agonist/antagonist properties (referred above) of HW-165 and its active (-)-species in relation to the adaptive state of central dopamine receptors and possible regional variations in feedback strength and organisation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
We sought to assess the impact of renal function on platelet reactivity in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy.
Diabetes mellitus is a key risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). In aspirin-treated DM patients the presence of moderate/severe CKD is associated with reduced clinical efficacy of adjunctive clopidogrel therapy. Whether these findings may be attributed to differences in clopidogrel-induced effects is unknown.
This was a cross-sectional observational study in which DM patients taking maintenance aspirin and clopidogrel therapy were studied. Patients were categorized into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of moderate/severe CKD. Platelet aggregation after adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen stimuli were assessed with light transmittance aggregometry and defined patients with high post-treatment platelet reactivity (HPPR). Markers of platelet activation, including glycoprotein IIb/IIIa activation and P-selectin expression, were also determined using flow cytometry.
A total of 306 DM patients were analyzed. Patients with moderate/severe CKD (n = 84) had significantly higher ADP-induced (60 +/- 13% vs. 52 +/- 15%, p = 0.001) and collagen-induced (49 +/- 20% vs. 41 +/- 20%, p = 0.004) platelet aggregation compared with those without (n = 222). After adjustment for potential confounders, patients with moderate/severe CKD were more likely to have HPPR after ADP (adjusted odds ratio: 3.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.7 to 8.5, p = 0.001) and collagen (adjusted odds ratio: 2.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 5.4; p = 0.029) stimuli. Markers of platelet activation were significantly increased in patients with HPPR.
In DM patients with coronary artery disease taking maintenance aspirin and clopidogrel therapy, impaired renal function is associated with reduced clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects and a greater prevalence of HPPR.
The nature and incidence of haematological side-effects of sulphasalazine was sought in a retrospective study of 130 sulphasalazine-treated patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis. Macrocytosis was seen to occur in 27 patients (20.8%) and four patients (3%) developed a macrocytic anaemia. Only eight of 23 macrocytic patients had low red cell folate levels, three of whom were anaemic. An increased risk of developing macrocytosis was seen with doses of sulphasalazine greater than 2 g per day. In most patients the macrocytosis was noted during the first 6 months but did occur in the second and third 6-month period of treatment. Only one patient (0.8%) developed neutropenia and no cases of thrombocytopenia were observed. Regular blood counts should be performed while patients remain on treatment but haematological side-effects are seldom the reason for withdrawal of sulphasalazine.
