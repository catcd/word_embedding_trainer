Multicenter clinical trials have established that the adjunctive use of the subgingival controlled release of chlorhexidine, (CHX chip), significantly reduces probing depth (PD), improves clinical attachment levels, and reduces bleeding on probing compared to scaling and root planing (SRP) alone for periods of up to 9 months. The present report is based on a phase IV clinical trial to examine the adjunctive use of the CHX chip for routine periodontal maintenance therapy (RPMT) over 2 years.
Eight hundred thirty-five (835) patients were recruited into the study. At baseline a CHX chip was placed in pocket sites with PD > or = 5 mm. The patients were scheduled to receive RPMT at 3-month intervals with repeated CHX chip placement at sites where the PD remained > or = 5 mm. Patients who did not attend the 24-month recall visit or who failed to attend 2 consecutive time frame examinations were excluded from the analyses.
The 595 patients included showed a continuous decrease in PD over 2 years of 0.95 mm. After 2 years, 23.2% of patients had at least 2 pockets showing a reduction in PD of 2 mm or more and 58.9% of the sites had been reduced to a PD of < 5 mm. Only 2.9% (n = 57) of the sites showed an increase in PD of > or = 2 mm. Adverse events were mild to moderate in nature and resolved spontaneously without medication.
The results of this Phase IV or follow-up trial indicate that the adjunctive use of the CHX chip is a clinically safe and effective treatment option for long-term management of chronic periodontitis.
The evoked expression of the immediate-early gene-encoded proteins c-Fos and Krox-24 was used to study activation of mesodiencephalic structures as a function of the development of cyclophosphamide (CP) cystitis in behaving rats. This article is the third of a series and completes previously published data obtained at both spinal and hindbrain levels. CP-injected animals received a single dose of 100 mg/kg i.p. under transient volatile anesthesia and survived for 1-4 h in order to cover the entire postinjection period during which the disease develops. Survival times longer than 4 h were not used owing to ethical considerations. Results from CP-injected groups are compared with those from either noninjected controls or saline-injected animals having survived for the same times as CP-injected ones. Quantitative results come from c-fos expression. At mesodiencephalic levels a high and widespread basal c-fos expression was observed in control animals; maximum staining was observed at the midthalamic level. Four groups of nuclei were identified with regard to the density of staining. The first group included nuclei showing clustered, intensely labeled cells; these areas were restricted in extent and related to the maintenance of circadian rythms (intergeniculate leaf, suprachiasmatic nucleus, dorsal parts of either paraventricular thalamic nuclei or central gray), sleep-arousal cycle (supramamillary nucleus), or changes in arterial pressure (laterodorsal tegmental nucleus). The second group included nuclei showing scattered, moderately labeled cells; these areas were widespread at all rostrocaudal levels and related to either autonomic/neuroendocrine regulations (central gray, lateral habenula, hypothalamus) or motor behavior, orienting reflex and oculomotor coordination (unspecific subdivisions of both colliculi and their adjoining mesencephalic regions, zona incerta dorsal). The third group included nuclei with evenly distributed, faintly labeled cells; these areas, which, with few exceptions, covered almost the entire diencephalon, mainly concerned nuclei of multisensory convergence having functions in either discriminative tasks (laterodorsal and lateroposterior thalamic nuclei) or emotional responses (intralaminar and midline thalamic nuclei). The fourth group included nuclei free of labeling; these were areas that received the bulk of unimodal sensory/motor inputs (central inferior colliculus, pretectal optic nuclei, ventral medial geniculate nucleus, ventral anterior pretectal nucleus, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, ventrobasal complex; zona incerta ventral, parafascicular thalamic nucleus) and are thus the most discriminative regarding specific modalities. Variations in staining were of the same magnitude in both saline- and CP-injected animals. A sequential study spanning every postinjection hour revealed maximum staining at 1 h postinjection, which was followed by a progressive, time-related decrease. Increases in the number of labeled cells 1 h postinjection were significant in only a restricted number of nuclei showing low basal expression (Edinger-Westphal nucleus and paraventricular, supraoptic, and lateral hypothalamic nuclei); time-related reductions in staining that were correlated to sleep or quiescence behaviors finally resulted in staining equal to or below that seen in control animals. No structures showed significantly increased staining in relation to the full development of cystitis, i.e., with the increase of visceronociceptive inputs. Comparing the present results with those previously obtained at more caudal levels, it appears that subtelencephalic levels primarily driven by visceronociceptive inputs, i.e., those that increase and/or maintain their activity in parallel with the degree of nociception, are confined to brainstem-spinal cord junction levels and only comprise certain subdivisions of the nucleus of the solitary tract (nucleus medialis, nucleus commissuralis, and ventralmost part of area po
Pregnant female mice of various congenic strains were injected on days 11 through 14 of gestation with phenytoin, and the fetuses were examined for the occurrence of cleft palate. The pattern of susceptibility indicates that two genes in the H-2 complex and another gene linked to H-3 are involved in the determination of this trait.
One hundred and one patients with rheumatoid arthritis were followed prospectively to assess the efficacy and toxicity of therapy with D-penicillamine. After a mean total followup of 11.5 months (38 patients have completed 2 years of followup) there was a 70% overall improvement rate with 2 complete remissions. Sixty-one patients developed 84 separate toxic reactions, 36 of which required drug withdrawal. Skin rashes (27/84), proteinuria (15/84), low platelets (14/84), and taste abnormalities (10/84) were the most common side effects of therapy at a mean D-penicillamine dose of 463 mg/day. The majority of toxic reactions (85%) occurred in the first 6 months, but proteinuria and thrombocytopenia were more common in the 6 to 12 month treatment period. Previous gold toxicity was a risk factor for developing D-penicillamine toxicity (10/13). Our observations suggest that D-penicillamine related toxicity is a major problem even at 500 mg/day, but the drug can be used with an increased safety margin after 9 months of continuous therapy.
To investigate the diagnostic value of cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and parvalbumin at mRNA and protein levels.
CK7 and parvalbumin mRNA expression levels in 23 oncocytomas and 32 chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) were examined using gene expression microarrays. Immunohistochemistry was performed using monoclonal antibodies specific for CK7 or parvalbumin in 41 chromophobe RCCs and 55 oncocytomas.
CK7 mRNA was overexpressed in 18 of 32 chromophobe RCCs but only 3 of 23 oncocytomas. Parvalbumin mRNA was overexpressed in 15 of 32 chromophobe RCCs and only 4 of 23 oncocytomas. In contrast, CK7 mRNA underexpression was noted in 13 of 23 oncocytomas and only 6 of 32 chromophobe RCCs, while parvalbumin underexpression was seen in 14 of 23 oncocytomas but only 6 of 32 chromophobe RCCs. By immunohistochemistry, 27 of 41 (66%) chromophobe RCCs expressed CK7 diffusely compared to only 3 of 55 (5%) oncocytomas. Diffuse parvalbumin expression was seen in all 41 of 41 (100%) chromophobe RCCs and only in 26 of 55 (47%) oncocytomas.
Both mRNA and protein expression levels of CK7 appear significantly higher in chromophobe RCC compared to oncocytoma (p < 0.001). Parvalbumin expression is less specific but often displays a patchy pattern in oncocytomas. Our study provides further evidence that CK7 and parvalbumin immunostains may be useful in differentiating oncocytoma from chromophobe RCC in problematic cases. Negative or patchy staining (< 50% cells) for CK7 and/or parvalbumin strongly favors the diagnosis of oncocytoma.
N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminadase (NAG) is a renal enzyme which is an early, sensitive and reliable indicator of renal damage. NAG assays of midstream spot urines were not significantly different in a group of controls when compared to patients starting lithium for the first time, or to a group of patients who had been taking lithium for more than one year. However, a small number of lithium-treated patients may have evidence of renal damage, identifiable by NAG assay.
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most frequent type of neurodegenerative dementias. Mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN, PGRN) were recently identified in FTDU-17, an FTD subtype characterized by ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions and linkage to chromosome 17q21. We looked for PGRN mutations in a large series of 210 FTD patients (52 familial, 158 sporadic) to accurately evaluate the frequency of PGRN mutations in both sporadic and familial FTD, and FTD with associated motoneuron disease (FTD-MND), as well as to study the clinical phenotype of patients with a PGRN mutation. We identified nine novel PGRN null mutations in 10 index patients. The relative frequency of PGRN null mutations in FTD was 4.8% (10/210) and 12.8% (5/39) in pure familial forms. Interestingly, 5/158 (3.2%) apparently sporadic FTD patients carried a PGRN mutation, suggesting the possibility of de novo mutations or incomplete penetrance. In contrast, none of the 43 patients with FTD-MND had PGRN mutations, supporting that FTDU-17 and FTD-MND are genetically distinct. The clinical phenotype of PGRN mutation carriers was particular because of the wide range in onset age and the frequent occurrence of early apraxia (50%), visual hallucinations (30%), and parkinsonism (30%) during the course of the disease. This study supports that PGRN null mutations represent a more frequent cause of FTD than MAPT mutations (4.8% vs. 2.9%) but are not responsible for FTD-MND. It also demonstrates that half of the patients with a PGRN mutation in our series had no apparent family history of dementia. Taking this into account, genetic testing should be now considered more systematically, even in patients without obvious familial history of FTD.
5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a heterocyclic product of the Maillard reaction, is a ubiquitous food contaminant. It has demonstrated hepatocarcinogenic activity in female mice. This effect may originate from sulfo conjugation of the benzylic alcohol yielding 5-sulfooxymethylfurfural (SMF), which is prone to react with DNA via nucleophilic substitution. Indeed, we showed that HMF induces gene mutations in Chinese hamster V79 cells engineered for the expression of human (h) sulfotransferase (SULT)1A1 but not in parental V79 cells. In order to identify potential DNA adducts, we incubated DNA samples with SMF or HMF in aqueous solution. Modified DNA was digested and surveyed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for adducts that may be formed by nucleosides either via nucleophilic substitution at the electrophilic carbon atom of SMF or via imine formation with the aldehyde group present in HMF and SMF. The most abundant adducts formed from SMF, N(6)-((2-formylfuran-5-yl)methyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine (N(6)-FFM-dAdo) and N(2)-((2-formylfuran-5-yl)methyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine (N(2)-FFM-dGuo), were synthesized, purified, and characterized by (1)H NMR. Imine adducts were only detected when DNA was incubated with very high levels of HMF following reduction of the imines to corresponding secondary amines by NaBH(3)CN. Sensitive techniques based on LC-MS/MS multiple reaction monitoring for the quantification of the adducts in DNA samples were devised using isotope-labeled [(15)N(5)]N(6)-FFM-dAdo and [(13)C(10),(15)N(5)]N(2)-FFM-dGuo as internal standards. Both 5-methylfurfuryl adducts were detected in DNA from V79-hSULT1A1 treated with HMF but not in DNA from V79 control cells. Considering the lack of other known mutagenic metabolites, we hypothesize that the hepatocarcinogenic potential of HMF originates from the formation of mutagenic SMF.
Estrogen-mediated cholestasis is an important clinical entity, but its molecular pathophysiology is still not fully understood. Impaired sodium-dependent uptake of bile acids has been associated with diminished expression of a basolateral Na(+)/bile acid cotransporter (Ntcp), whereas sodium-independent uptake is maintained despite a down-regulation of the organic anion transporter Oatp1. Thus, expression of the two other rat Oatps (Oatps2 and -4) was determined in estrogen-induced cholestasis. In addition, known transactivators of Oatp2 and Ntcp were studied to further characterize transcriptional regulation of these transporter genes.
Hepatic protein and mRNA expression of various Oatps (1, 2, 4) in comparison to Ntcp were analyzed after 0.5, 1, 3 and 5 days of ethinylestradiol (EE) treatment (5 mg/kg) in rats. Binding activities of Oatp2 and Ntcp transactivators were assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
All basolateral Oatps (1, 2 and 4) were specifically down-regulated at the protein level by 30-40% of controls, but less pronounced than Ntcp (minus 70-80%). In contrast to unaltered Oatp4 mRNA levels, Oatp1 and Oatp2 mRNAs were reduced to various extents (minus 40-90% of controls). Binding activity of known transactivators of Ntcp and Oatp2 such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), CAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) were also diminished during the time of cholestasis.
Estrogen-induced cholestasis results in a down-regulation of all basolateral organic anion transporters. The moderate decline in expression of Oatp1, -2 and -4 may explain the unchanged sodium-independent transport of bile acids due to overlapping substrate specificity. Reduction in transporter gene expression seems to be mediated by a diminished nuclear binding activity of transactivators such as HNF1, C/EBP and PXR by estrogens.
Mesalamines are slow-release formulations of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and are effective as primary treatment and maintenance therapy in inflammatory bowel disease. Interstitial nephritis is a recognized side effect. We report two cases of biopsy-confirmed interstitial nephritis in patients being treated with 5-ASA. Both had a trial of steroid therapy. One patient had partial recovery of renal function but the other patient was in chronic renal failure and likely was approaching the need for dialysis. Interstitial nephritis is an under-recognized complication of 5-ASA therapy. Early identification and withdrawal of this drug can lead to a partial or complete reversal of renal dysfunction.
The influence of amrinone (AM), a positive inotropic drug, on cardiotoxicity induced by repeated adriamycin (ADR) administration, was studied in rats. AM, administered at various doses, did not affect rat body weight gain, heart rate, electrocardiographic parameters (QRS complex, S alpha T segment, T-wave), or the histological cardiac picture. By contrast, ADR markedly inhibited rat body weight increase and induced the appearance of early ECG alterations, especially S alpha T widening, as well as morphological cardiac changes consisting of macrovacuolation of myocytes, atrophy, necrosis and fibrosis. When given with ADR, AM reduced the toxicity of ADR limiting the deleterious effects of the drug on body weight gain and delaying the appearance of ECG abnormalities, particularly S alpha T widening and T-wave flattening. The severity of cardiac lesions histologically evaluated at the end of the experiment, however, was similar in rats given ADR or AM plus ADR. These results may be explained by taking into account the ability of AM to increase the Ca2+ influx through the slow channels in myocardial cells, thus counteracting the decreased inward slow Ca2+ currents due to ADR. The failure of AM to improve histological cardiac alterations significantly, seems to indicate that among the numerous pathogenetic mechanisms of ADR-induced cardiotoxicity, the changes in cellular Ca2+ fluxes play an important, but not a fundamental role.
A 69-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and hypertension, was referred to the Hospital of Laredo because of hyponatraemia. She had weakness and slight dyspnoea with no evidence of extracellular fluid volume depletion or oedema. Serum sodium level on admission was 125 mol l-1, plasma osmolality 270 mosmol kg-1, simultaneous urine osmolality was 580 mosmol kg-1 and urine sodium 32.6 mmol l-1. She had been treated with enalapril (20 mg) daily for 4 months. She was diagnosed with the Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) that was reversed after cessation of treatment with enalapril and reappeared on reintroduction of the drug at the same daily doses.
Fifty-three patients with advanced lymphocytic lymphoma were randomly assigned to treatment with the combination cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) or the same agents used successively in maximal doses (C-V-P). Complete remissions occurred in 68% with CVP and 48% with C-V-P. For patients with nodular lymphoma, the complete remission rate was 81% with CVP and 46% with C-V-P. In patients with diffuse lymphoma a complete remission rate of 50% was obtained with both regimens. The median duration of response was longer for patients who obtained complete remission with CVP (37+ months) than for those entering remission with C-V-P (25+ months). More patients treated with CVP still survive. Current results suggest that CVP is a better induction regime than C-V-P in patients with nodular lymphoma. However, in patients with diffuse lympoocytic lymphoma, neither regimen results in more than 50% complete remissions or significant numbers of prolonged responses. More effective therapy is needed.
The 'Oxford' system for continuous monitoring of the ambulatory blood pressure was used to assess the changes in blood pressure following therapy with the slow channel inhibitor, verapamil. Sixteen patients were studied on no therapy and following a minimum of 6 weeks therapy (dose range 120-160 mg t.d.s.). During each study patients underwent standardized physiological tests including tilt, isometric handgrip and dynamic bicycle exercise. Verapamil was demonstrated to produce a consistent reduction of blood pressure over most of the 24 h period studied but this was most marked during the day. Heart rate was also reduced. There was no postural hypotension and the absolute responses to dynamic and isometric exercise were reduced. The results demonstrate the antihypertensive efficacy of 'slow channel inhibitors' as represented by verapamil.
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder caused by the deficiency of the C1-inhibitor gene (C1INH) . Patients experience recurrent bouts of edema, which can occur in almost any region of the body. As regards the treatment of the disease, danazol (an attenuated androgen) is used, among other agents, for long-term prophylaxis.
The aim of this study was to investigate the possible adverse effects of danazol on serum lipid profile, as well as to ascertain whether danazol treatment is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis.
Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B-100, and lipoprotein(a) were compared between danazol-treated patients with HAE and 2 control groups (ie, patients who did not receive long-term danazol prophylaxis and untreated healthy subjects).
Serum concentrations of HDL ( P = .0002 and P < .0001) and apolipoprotein A-I ( P = .0015 and P < .0001) were significantly lower, whereas LDL ( P = .0129 and P = .0127) and apolipoprotein B-100 ( P = .0456 and P = .0013) were higher in the danazol-treated patients compared with the 2 control groups, respectively. No significant difference was found in total cholesterol, triglyceride, or lipoprotein(a) levels. Patients who received danazol had an 11.6 (95% CI, 2.7-49.7) times higher risk for abnormally low HDL levels and a 4.4 (95% CI, 1.2-16.0) times lower risk for high LDL concentrations.
Our findings indicate that the long-term use of danazol is associated with an increased risk for early atherosclerosis in patients with HAE. Consequently, monitoring of HDL and LDL levels at regular intervals is recommended during follow-up.
To assess toxicities associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among HIV-1-infected pregnant women treated with nevirapine-based regimens according to Mozambican national guidelines.
Prospective cohort study.
HIV-1-infected antiretroviral-naive pregnant women with CD4 counts < or =350 cells/microL were initiated on nevirapine, lamivudine, and stavudine or zidovudine and followed monthly. Severe hepatotoxicity was defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels > or =5-fold the upper limit of normal. Analyses were stratified by baseline CD4 count (<250 vs. 250-350 cells/microL).
Among 146 pregnant women, 75 (52%) began nevirapine, lamivudine, and zidovudine and 71 (48%) began nevirapine, lamivudine, and stavudine. Overall, 79 (54%) women had CD4 counts <250 cells/microL, 7 (5%) had grade II hepatotoxicity, and 4 (3%) had severe (grade III or IV) hepatotoxicity. All 4 women with severe hepatotoxicity had baseline CD4 counts > or =250 cells/microL (P = 0.02). Rates of skin toxicity, anemia, and peripheral neuropathy did not differ by CD4 cell count group. Overall, 12 (8%) women changed or discontinued HAART as a result of drug toxicity.
Severe hepatotoxicity from nevirapine-containing HAART in this cohort of pregnant women was more common at higher CD4 counts (6% vs. 0% among women with CD4 counts > or =250 cells/microL and CD4 counts <250 cells/microL, respectively), suggesting that laboratory monitoring is necessary when administering nevirapine-containing regimens to pregnant women with CD4 counts > or =250 cells/microL.
We describe a postpartum 30-year-old woman who developed headaches, hypertension, and speech disturbances after bromocriptine treatment to suppress lactation. Brain MRI revealed intraparenchymal hematomas, and an angiographic study showed multiple arterial segmental narrowings compatible with postpartum cerebral angiopathy. We also comment on other cases of postpartum cerebral angiopathy.
The efficacy and safety of verapamil and nifedipine were objectively assessed in patients with chronic stable angina. Twenty four patients entered a double blind randomized cross over trial of nifedipine (10 mg thrice daily) and placebo. In this dosage nifedipine did not show any significant change in exercise duration and the variables obtained using computer assisted exercise testing when compared to placebo. The next stage consisted of another double blind randomized cross over trial comparing the effects of verapamil (120 mg thrice daily) and nifedipine (20 mg thrice daily) with an initial placebo run-in period in 32 patients. At this dose level nifedipine showed a definite and significant improvement in all the objective variables; however an increase in side effects was observed resulting in withdrawal of the drug in seven patients. A common problem was tachycardia precipitating angina after nifedipine ingestion. On the other hand verapamil produced a marked improvement in exercise tolerance and other variables as compared to placebo and nifedipine, was well tolerated and produced a mild bradycardia. This study clearly indicates that verapamil is distinctly superior to nifedipine in efficacy side effects and safety in patients with chronic stable angina. This may be attributable to the differential effect on heart rates induced by these drugs.
Animal and in vitro models of prostate cancer demonstrate high IL-10 levels result in smaller tumors, fewer metastases, and reduced angiogenesis compared to controls. We sought to examine the hypothesis that genotypes correlated with low IL-10 production may be associated with increased prostate cancer risk among Finnish male participants from the Alpha-tocopherol Beta-carotene Cancer Prevention Study. DNA from 584 prostate cancer cases and 584 controls was genotyped for four IL-10 alleles, -1082, -819, -592, and 210. DNA from more of the controls than cases failed to amplify, resulting in 509 cases and 382 controls with genotype data for -1082; 507 and 384 for -819; 511 and 386 for -592; and 491 and 362 for 210. Odds ratios for the association between the IL-10 genotypes and risk of prostate cancer or, among cases only, high-grade disease were calculated using logistic regression. In this population, the -819 TT and -592 AA low expression genotypes were highly correlated. These two genotypes also were associated with increased prostate cancer susceptibility (OR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.07-3.43 for -819) and, among cases, with high-grade tumors (OR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.26-5.20 for -819). These data demonstrate genotypes correlated with low IL-10 production are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer and with high-grade disease in this population.
Urinary bladder cancers following prolonged cyclophosphamide therapy are being increasingly reported. We report a case of transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder occurring 12 years after pulse intravenous therapy with cyclophosphamide for Hodgkin's disease. The mechanism of bladder carcinogenesis and the possible role of the uroprotector MESNA in preventing cyclophosphamide induced bladder cancer are discussed.
The effects of papaverine on haloperidol-induced catalepsy and apomorphine-induced stereotypy as well as brain monoamines concentrations in rats were studied. Papaverine increased cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol whilst reduced stereotypy induced by apomorphine. Slight but significant decrease in brain dopamine concentration was observed in rats treated with papaverine. The present study indicates that papaverine has influences upon dopaminergic mechanisms in the brain.
Metronidazole is a little known cause of drug-induced optic neuropathy. We report a patient who developed progressive visual loss after an 8-month course of Metronidazole. Electrophysiology confirmed a bilateral optic neuropathy. Her vision improved dramatically with cessation of the drug.
The renoprotective potential of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist pioglitazone was explored in an immune model of progressive nephropathy, passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), compared with that of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, taken as standard therapy for renoprotection. PHN rats received orally vehicle, pioglitazone (10 mg/kg twice daily), or candesartan (1 mg/kg twice daily) from months 2 to 8. Pioglitazone reduced proteinuria as effectively as candesartan and limited renal functional and structural changes. Kidneys from untreated PHN rats showed lower nephrin mRNA and protein than controls, both restored by pioglitazone. The effect was seen both early and late during the course of the disease. Whether the antiproteinuric effect of pioglitazone could be due to its effect on nephrin gene transcription also was investigated. HK-2 cells were transfected with plasmids that harbor the luciferase gene under portions (2-kb or 325-bp) of human nephrin gene promoter that contain putative peroxisome proliferator-responsive elements (PPRE) and incubated with pioglitazone (10 muM). Transcriptional activity of luciferase gene was highly increased by pioglitazone, with the strongest expression achieved with the 325-bp fragment. Increase in luciferase activity was prevented by bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, a PPAR-gamma synthetic antagonist. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments showed a direct interaction of PPAR/retinoid X receptor heterodimers to PPRE present in the enhancer region of the nephrin promoter. In conclusion, pioglitazone exerts an antiproteinuric effect in immune-mediated glomerulonephritis as angiotensin II receptor antagonist does. Enhancement of nephrin gene transcription through specific PPRE in its promoter discloses a novel mechanism of renoprotection for PPAR-gamma agonists.
The recent scientific literature indicates that beyond merely protecting against scurvy vitamin C contributes to many aspects of human health. The main areas of research reviewed include: 1. Vitamin C requirements of smokers. The data indicate that the vitamin C requirement of smokers is higher by at least 60 mg per day (up to 140 mg per day) than that of nonsmokers. 2. Important functions of the body, such as immune response, pulmonary function, and iron absorption are related to vitamin C intakes. Daily vitamin C intake of at least 150-200 mg per day enhance these functions. 3. Vitamin C may play critical roles in the prevention of CHD, cancer and cataract. Based on the available data, vitamin C intakes of at least 80-120 mg per day are associated with lowering the risk of these chronic diseases. 4. The literature documents that these and much higher intake levels of vitamin C are safe.
Complications associated with the use of cocaine are varied, and include cerebral hemorrhage and ischemia, with vasculitis and vasospasm as possible etiologies. We reviewed selected brain samples from 14 autopsy cases of cocaine-related cerebrovascular disease. Intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage was present in 12 cases. Intracranial arterioles were either normal or showed nonspecific changes. From these observations, we suggest that intracranial hemorrhages occur in the absence of readily detectable vascular abnormalities.
A 34-year-old patient developed metastic endometrial carcinoma after Hodgkin disease in childhood. She had ovarian failure after abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy for Hodgkin disease, and received exogenous estrogens, a treatment implicated in the development of endometrial cancer in menopausal women. Young women on replacement estrogens for ovarian failure after cancer therapy may also have increased risk of endometrial carcinoma and should be examined periodically.
