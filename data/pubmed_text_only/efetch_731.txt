1. Immunoreactive beta-endorphin (IR-beta EP) was two- to three-fold higher in pituitary neuro-intermediate lobes (N-IL) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) than of normotensive Wistar--Kyoto (NT-WKY) controls. 2. Plasma levels of IR-beta EP were lower in SHR than in NT-WKY rats. 3. Intravenous injections of morphine lowered blood pressure of both SHR and NT-WKY rats to the same level; naloxone restored blood pressure of both groups to pre-morphine values. 4. Infusion of bromocriptine in SHR for 1 week lowered blood pressure and N-IL IR-beta EP concentration. 5. These results confirm and extend postulated dopaminergic defect in this model of hypertension.
The narcotic antagonist, naloxone, was microinjected into the head of the caudate nucleus (HC), periaqueductal gray matter (PG), and cerebellar white matter (CB) of rats to counteract the catatonia induced by systemic morphine. Naloxone produced a loss of the catatonic response when administered into HC or PG, but not when microinjected into CB. Isotonic saline in HC, PG, and CB did not counteract the catatonic effects of morphine. The reversal of catatonia was similar for naloxone injections in HC and PG. Both these areas have high concentrations of opiate receptors while CB has few opiate receptors. It is suggested that the HC and PG are involved in the reversal of the catatonic effects of morphine via the high concentrations of opiate receptors found there.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the current mainstay of treatment for various liver diseases including primary biliary cirrhosis. UDCA acts as a bile secretagogue, cytoprotective agent, immunomodulator, and inhibitor of cellular apoptosis. Despite this cumulative evidence of the cytoprotective and immunosuppressive effects of UDCA, both the target molecule and pathway of UDCA action remain unknown. We previously described that, in the absence of glucocorticoid ligand, UDCA activates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) into DNA binding species but does not elicit its transactivational function in a transient transfection assay. Here we further studied the molecular mechanism of UDCA action and revealed that the ligand binding domain of the GR is responsible for UDCA-dependent nuclear translocation of the GR. Indeed, we demonstrated that UDCA acts on the distinct region of the ligand binding domain when compared with the classical GR agonist dexamethasone, resulting in loss of coactivator recruitment and differential regulation of gene expression by the GR. Our data clearly indicated that UDCA, at least in part via activation of the GR, suppresses NF-kappaB-dependent transcription through the intervention of GR-p65 interaction. Together with the established clinical safety of UDCA, we may propose that UDCA could be a prototypical compound for development of a novel and selective GR modifier.
Implantation of foreign materials into mice and humans has been noted to result in the appearance of soft tissue sarcomas at the site of implantation. These materials include metal replacement joints and Dacron vascular grafts. In addition, occupational exposure to nickel has been shown to result in an increased risk of carcinogenesis. The molecular mechanisms of foreign body-induced carcinogenesis are not fully understood.
In order to gain insight into these mechanisms, we implanted nickel sulfide into wild type C57BL/6 mice as well as a mouse heterozygous for the tumor suppressor gene, p53. Malignant fibrous histiocytomas arose in all mice, and we have characterized the profile of tumor suppressor genes and signal transduction pathways altered in these cells.
All tumors demonstrated hypermethylation of the tumor suppressor gene p16, as well as activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling pathway. This knowledge may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of tumors caused by foreign body implantation.
Oxidative stress induced by nickel sulfide appears to cause loss of p16 and activation of MAP kinase signaling. These findings support the hypothesis of synergistic interactions between MAP kinase activation and p16 loss in carcinogenesis.
The purpose of the current study is to understand the clinicopathological implications of redox proteins in association with androgen receptor (AR) and HER-2 status in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers through evaluation of the expression patterns of redox proteins, such as catalase, thioredoxin reductase (TxNR), glutathione S-transferase π (GSTπ), thioredoxin interacting protein (TxNIP), and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD).
Two hundred cases of ER-negative breast cancer samples were collected as a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemical staining was done for redox-related proteins, after which the resulting data set was organized by AR and HER-2 status.
The redox proteins that had a significant association with AR and HER-2 status were tumoral catalase (p < 0.001) and stromal GSTπ (p < 0.001). Tumoral catalase was least expressed in the AR-/HER-2- group, while stromal GSTπ was least expressed in both the AR+/HER-2- and the AR-/HER-2- groups. Stromal GSTπ was highly expressed in HER-2 positive groups (p < 0.001). Stromal GSTπ negativity and tumoral MnSOD positivity were associated with a shorter disease-free survival (p = 0.041 and p = 0.007, respectively) in univariate analysis.
ER-negative breast cancers showed different expressions of redox-related proteins according to AR and HER-2 status. Catalase expression was high in AR-negative groups, while stromal GSTπ expression was high in HER-2-positive groups.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), which is an herbicide used to control the growth of broadleaf weeds, had a direct or an indirect (mediated by undernutrition) hypomyelinating effect. We also proposed to analyze the effect of 2,4-D on undernourished (UN) pups. Four experimental rat groups were used: well-nourished (WN) pups, litters with eight offsprings; UN pups, litters with fourteen offsprings; WN pups whose mother received 70 mg/kg/day of 2,4-D from postnatal day (PND) 9 to 21 (WN70 pups); and UN pups whose mother received 70 mg/kg/day of 2,4-D from PND 9 to 21 (UN70 pups). In this work, we demonstrated that (1) myelin proteins (analyzed by Western blot and/or immunohistochemical study) showed a significant decrease in WN70, UN, and UN70 with respect to control group; (2) there is a good correlation between these myelin-specific protein expression with the degree of myelin compaction detected by electron microscopy in groups exposed to 2,4-D; (3) a decreased and normal number of myelin sheets were detected in UN and 2,4-D exposed pups, respectively; and (4) undernourishment sensitized pups to the hypomyelinating effect of 2,4-D. According to this and besides the fact that WN70 group have no body weight changes, these results are indicating that 2,4-D and undernourishment are two independent hypomyelinating factors.
We examined the rates of malignancy at 2 yr after transplantation in renal allograft patients receiving sirolimus (SRL) in continuous combination with cyclosporine (CsA), SRL as base therapy or SRL maintenance therapy after early withdrawal of CsA. A total of 1295 patients were enrolled in two double-blind studies comparing SRL with azathioprine (AZA) or placebo administered in continuous regimens with CsA. In two other trials (n = 161), SRL given as base therapy was compared with CsA. In the fifth trial, patients were randomly assigned at 3 months to either remain on CsA + SRL therapy (n = 215) or to have CsA eliminated with SRL being continued in concentration-controlled doses (n = 215). At 2 yr after transplantation, patients receiving SRL in continuous combination with CsA had a significantly lower incidence of skin cancer compared with patients receiving placebo. Patients receiving SRL as base therapy had no malignancies compared with a 5% incidence in those receiving CsA. The incidence of malignancy was significantly lower in patients receiving concentration-controlled SRL with elimination of CsA compared with those who remained on CsA + SRL. Based on the currently available data, patients receiving SRL-based therapy without CsA or SRL maintenance therapy after early CsA withdrawal have lower rates of malignancy in the first 2 yr after renal transplantation. SRL immunotherapy may be beneficial in protecting renal transplant patients from skin cancer even when given in combination with CsA.
Placebo controlled trials in over 25,000 women showed that tamoxifen reduced breast cancer risk by about 40% and osteoporotic fracture risk by about 32%. Similarly placebo controlled trials in nearly 18,000 women showed that raloxifene reduced breast cancer risk by 44-72% and osteoporotic fractures risk by 30-50%. A direct comparison of tamoxifen with raloxifene showed similar risk reduction for breast cancer and osteoporotic fractures with less toxicity for raloxifene.
Flinch (pain) thresholds for electric current delivered to the feet were correlated with the amount of necrosis within the diencephalon and telencephalon for rats in which seizures had been induced by lithium and pilocarpine about two months before the testing. The shared variance of the quantitative damage within the claustrum, the anterior part of the paraventricular nucleus of thalamus, (central) mediodorsal thalamus, and lateral amygdala (ventromedial part) explained 81% of the variance in the nociceptive (flinch) thresholds. A primary role of the claustrum within the neuropathways that mediate the response to the interoceptive and "painful" characteristics of stimuli is indicated. The concept of primary pathways versus "emergent" pathways subsequent to excitotoxic damage within the neuromatrix is discussed.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous and oral propafenone for termination of recent onset (<48 hrs) atrial fibrillation. Forty-seven nonvalvular patients with atrial fibrillation were included in the study. Sinus rhythm was restored in 19/31 (61.3%) patients after intravenous treatment: in 15/31 (48.4%) atrial fibrillation was stopped after bolus of propafenone in dose of 2 mg/kg body weight, in 4/16 (25.0%) - by followed infusion of medicine in dose of 0.008 mg/kg/min during 2 hrs. A single 600 mg oral dose of propafenone restored sinus rhythm in 9/16 (56.2%) patients during 4 hrs. Transformation of atrial fibrillation into regular atrial flutter was observed in 4 cases; in 1 of them right bundle branch block developed.
The paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin regimen has been used to treat metastatic testicular cancer with successful results. We investigated the usefulness of a paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and nedaplatin (TIN) regimen as salvage therapy for patients with advanced testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs).
Eight patients with advanced GCTs were treated with TIN. The treatment was performed as salvage therapy for cases refractory to therapies, such as bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin, and irinotecan with nedaplatin. The TIN regimen consisted of paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) by 24-h infusion on day 1, followed by ifosfamide (1.2 g/m(2)) infusions over 2 h on days 2-6, and nedaplatin (100 mg/m(2)) given over 2 h on day 2.
Seven out of eight patients achieved a disease-free status after chemotherapy, followed by surgical resection of the residual tumor. Six of the seven patients have continued to show no evidence of disease after salvage therapy, with a median follow-up period of 27 months, but one patient developed a 'growing teratoma syndrome' in the mediastinum 31 months after TIN chemotherapy. All patients developed grade 4 leukocytopenia. However, it could be managed by using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Only one patient developed grade 2 sensory neuropathy and no patient developed nephrotoxicity.
The TIN regimen was efficacious and well-tolerated as salvage chemotherapy for Japanese patients with advanced GCTs.
Depression is highly prevalent and frequently recurs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension. Certain medications used to treat hypertension are alleged to be associated with higher risk of depression.
To compare depressive symptoms before and during treatment with 2 equivalent hypertension treatment strategies in patients with CAD stratified according to a self-reported history of physician-diagnosed depression.
Patients enrolled in a randomized hypertension treatment study were mailed baseline and one year follow-up surveys and stratified according to a self-reported history of depression. Patients (N = 1152) were 50 years old or older with hypertension and clinically stable CAD. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D). High risk of depression was defined as a history of physician-diagnosed depression reported by patients on the baseline survey. Depressive symptoms were compared for verapamil sustained-release (SR)- and atenolol-based hypertension treatment.
Among patients with a previous history of depression, depressive symptoms improved over the one year follow-up period for patients assigned to both treatment regimens. Depressive symptoms improved for patients with no depression history in the verapamil SR group (p < 0.001) and were unchanged in the atenolol group (p = 0.52). Patients assigned to the atenolol-based strategy without prior history of depression were more likely to worsen 5 or more points on the CES-D.
When antihypertensive treatment options are clinically equivalent, prescribers may first consider using a verapamil SR-based strategy, especially in patients with CAD who have no history of depression.
We describe the first well documented case of overflow urinary incontinence owing to prolonged carbamazepine treatment for temporal lobe seizures. Carbamazepine increased the bladder capacity to 1,700 ml. and was accompanied by symptoms of urgency and frequency. After carbamazepine was discontinued and the patient was given primidone the voiding symptoms disappeared. Post-voiding catheterization of the bladder showed minimal residual urine volume. In a review of urological adverse reactions of anticonvulsant drugs that are effective in the management of temporal lobe seizures we found that only primidone and phenobarbital have not been convincingly associated with such side effects. However, phenytoin and clonazepam have been linked with urinary incontinence, and valproic acid with enuresis.
To identify candidate genes involved in the development of colorectal cancer, we used cDNA microarrays to analyze gene expression differences between human colorectal tumors and paired adjacent normal mucosa. We identified approximately 3.5-fold significant downregulation of selenium-binding protein 1 (SBP1) in colorectal tumors compared to normal mucosa (p = 0.003). Importantly, stage III colorectal cancer patients with low tumor-SBP1 expression had significantly shorter disease-free and overall survival as compared with those patients with high tumor-SBP1 expression (p = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). We further characterized the role of SBP1 in colorectal cancer in vivo and in vitro. In normal tissue, SBP1 was maximally expressed in terminally differentiated epithelial cells on the luminal surface of crypts in the large intestine. Consistent with this in vivo localization, SBP1 was upregulated during in vitro colonic cell differentiation along the absorptive (Caco-2) and secretory (HT29 Clones 16E and 19A) cell lineages. Downregulation (approximately 50%) of SBP1 expression by small interfering RNA in colonic cancer cells was associated with reduced expression of another epithelial differentiation marker, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), although PCNA and p21(WAF1/cip1 )expression were not altered. These data demonstrate that higher expression of SBP1 is associated with differentiation of the normal colonic epithelia and may be a positive prognostic factor for survival in stage III colorectal carcinoma.
A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was undertaken in 135 patients to determine whether 4 weeks of treatment with long-acting nisoldipine coat-core (20 mg once a day) could alter diastolic function in patients with a recent myocardial infarction and with mild left ventricular dysfunction as indicated by a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 50%. The primary endpoint was the change in diastolic filling parameters assessed by Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography. The mean time of admission to the study was 20 days (range 7-35) after myocardial infarction. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 41%. The drug increased early diastolic peak velocity at the tips of the mitral leaflet by 0.06 m.s-1 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.01, 0.11). The time velocity integral was increased by 1.2 cm (95% CI: 0.16, 2.27). These findings are indicative of increased early diastolic flow across the mitral valve. An important determinant appeared to be a reduced isovolumic relaxation time (by 14.7 ms, 95% CI: -22.5, -6.9). As there was no change in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure or cardiac output, afterload reduction appeared unlikely as an explanation. Peak workload on exercise was 12 watts higher in the group on nisoldipine (95% CI: 0.8, 23.3). Thus, nisoldipine was shown to improve indices of diastolic ventricular function, as well as exercise capacity, in this group of patients. The observed effects of nisoldipine may reflect an anti-ischaemic effect or be due to improved relaxation of the myocardium.
To investigate the relationship between mossy fiber axon sprouting (MFS), synaptic reorganization in the dentate gyrus, and the mechanism of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy induced by pilocarpine.
The mossy fiber sprouting and synapse formation were observed in rats after the acute status epileticus and chronic spontaneous temporal lobe epilepsy induced by pilocarpine using in situ hybridization of GAP-43 mRNA (a marker of MFS), an immunohistochemical staining of synaptophysin (P38, a marker of synaptogenes), and Neo-Timm staining.
In hippocampus granule cell, there was a significant increase in the GAP-43mRNA levels measured 6 - 12 h after the end of status epileticus induced by pilocarpine. In contrast, synaptophysin immunoreactivity progressively increased in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus from 7 d, which was in line with the Neo-Timm stain results that revealed a time-dependent growth of aberrant MFS into the dentate inner molecular layer. The GAP-43 mRNA levels in pilocarpine treated animals were significantly decreased after status epileticus.
These results provide evidence for newly formed excitatory recurrent circuits, which might constitute a structural basis for chronic enhanced excitation and epileptogenesis in the hippocampus of pilocarpine-treated rats.
To report a case of an acute dystonic episode in a patient with Tourette's disorder (TD) treated with the partial dopamine agonist aripiprazole.
An 18-year-old male with TD was prescribed aripiprazole 10 mg orally daily, which produced a significant improvement in his symptoms. However, after 3 days of treatment, he experienced an acute episode of dystonia with facial muscle spasm, oculogyric crisis, and torticolis. All symptoms resolved after a single intramuscular injection of biperidine 5 mg. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that the adverse events were probably caused by aripiprazole.
To our knowledge, as of this writing, this is the first report concerning an aripiprazole-induced dystonic episode in an adult, and it is especially notable because it occurred at low dosage. Aripiprazole is a dopamine partial agonist and a serotonin(2A) antagonist with a favorable adverse effect profile. Short-term clinical trials reported a very low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms, with akathisia being the most common, although there have been reports of severe extrapyramidal symptoms in a 3-year-old child and in an adolescent with a previous history of such symptoms.
Acute dystonic phenomena may be caused by aripiprazole, although the drug's suggested mode of action largely precludes them.
Exposure of the male germ cell to cyclophosphamide during spermatogenesis and sperm maturation can interfere with development of the embryo. When male rats were treated with a chronic low dose of cyclophosphamide for 4 wk there was a dramatic increase in early postimplantation loss in their progeny, characterized by implantation sites selectively lacking in embryonic tissues. The present study was designed to determine the earliest appearance of a paternal effect of cyclophosphamide treatment and to examine whether the embryonic lineage was selectively affected. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally dosed for 4-5 wk with saline or 6 mg/kg per day of cyclophosphamide; their progeny were obtained on Days 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 4.5 of gestation. Paternal cyclophosphamide treatment had no effect on the mean number of embryos per pregnant female. However, as early as Day 3 of gestation, there was a significant decrease in cell number among the embryos sired by cyclophosphamide-treated males, increasing to a greater than 50% decrease in cell number by Day 4. The cell doubling time in embryos sired by treated males (16 h) was longer than that of controls (12 h). This decreased proliferation rate was confirmed by a dramatic decrease in the capacity of both Day 3 and Day 4 embryos sired by cyclophosphamide-treated males to incorporate [3H]thymidine over a 26-h culture period. Cytogenetic analysis in a limited number of blastomeres entering metaphase revealed no evidence of chromosomal abnormalities. Both the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass cells were proportionally decreased in Day 4.5 embryos sired by cyclophosphamide-treated males. Thus, paternal cyclophosphamide exposure affected both cell lineages in the conceptus as early as Day 3 of gestation.
Increased oxidative stress and dysregulation of nitric oxide have been implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX), a commonly used antitumor agent. Peroxynitrite is a reactive oxidant produced from nitric oxide and superoxide in various forms of cardiac injury. Using a novel metalloporphyrinic peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, FP15, and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors or knockout mice, we now delineate the pathogenetic role of peroxynitrite in rodent models of DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Mice received a single injection of DOX (25 mg/kg IP). Five days after DOX administration, left ventricular performance was significantly depressed, and high mortality was noted. Treatment with FP15 and an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, aminoguanidine, reduced DOX-induced mortality and improved cardiac function. Genetic deletion of the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene was also accompanied by better preservation of cardiac performance. In contrast, inhibition of the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased DOX-induced mortality. FP15 reduced the DOX-induced increase in serum LDH and creatine kinase activities. Furthermore, FP15 prevented the DOX-induced increase in lipid peroxidation, nitrotyrosine formation, and metalloproteinase activation in the heart but not NAD(P)H-driven superoxide generation. Peroxynitrite neutralization did not interfere with the antitumor effect of DOX. FP15 also decreased ischemic injury in rats and improved cardiac function and survival of mice in a chronic model of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
Thus, peroxynitrite plays a key role in the pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiac failure. Targeting peroxynitrite formation may represent a new cardioprotective strategy after DOX exposure or in other conditions associated with peroxynitrite formation, including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Drug-induced renal injury represents a frequent clinical entity. The most common drugs associated with acute tubular necrosis are aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, radiocontrast agents, and cyclosporine, but no data exist about the potential renal toxicity due to anthelmintics administration. Anthelmintics are commonly considered quite safe agents, and side effects such as gastrointestinal, neurologic, hematologic, or hepatic injury have been only rarely described. We report a 4-year-old boy with persistent massive proteinuria without any other symptoms/signs suggesting nephrotic syndrome (NS). The only relevant anamnestic data was the administration of pyrantel pamoate due to oxyuriasis 7 days before the proteinuria development. The patient was affected by NS diagnosed 6 months before and treated with a 12-week course of corticosteroids. During follow-up, carried out at 3 and 6 months after discharge, he did not show further episodes of proteinuria, and no clinical symptoms/signs suggesting a relapse of NS were ever detected. Considering that the proteinuria observed in our patient spontaneously disappeared after 10 days without any treatment, apart from the interruption of the anthelmintic therapy, we would like to alert pediatricians about the possible occurrence of anthelmintics-related renal complications especially among predisposed patients and to perform a watchful waiting not considering the presence of even massive proteinuria as a certain sign of NS relapse.
The origin of cochleovestibular deficits remains hypothetical, a viral attack or a circulatory disorder being the two most frequently reported hypotheses. We report the case history of a patient suffering from a cochleovestibular deficit after consumption of cocaine, a drug known for its vascular effects. The MRI scans were compatible with an intralabyrinthine haemorrhage. To our knowledge, this is the first case of cochleovestibular deficit due to an intralabyrinthine haemorrhage following cocaine consumption.
Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is widely used for the treatment of hypertension. Clinical experience with this drug has demonstrated that it is safe. Losartan-induced hepatic toxicity is extremely rare. We report a case of severe hepatic toxicity and fibrosis caused by losartan use, and we review four previously reported cases. Drug-induced hepatic injury may be seen during the treatment of hypertension by losartan and the clinician should be aware of this toxicity, especially during the initial phase of treatment.
Granulomatous hepatitis has many causes. Drugs are an important etiologic factor. Several oral hypoglycemic agents are available for treatment of type II diabetes. Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, is a newer agent in this class. It has not been shown to be hepatotoxic in the premarketing trials. However, a few case reports have implicated it as a cause of acute hepatocellular injury. The authors report a case of granulomatous hepatitis associated with use of rosiglitazone. Liver function tests should be done regularly to monitor patients on this medication.
