We have experienced a case of myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-related glomerulonephritis induced by propylthiouracil (PTU). A 45-year-old female had been treated with PTU for 4 years after the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. She was referred to out hospital because of abrupt macroscopic hematuria and moderate proteinuria after several days of upper respiratory tract infection. On admission, her laboratory findings showed deterioration of renal function. Renal biopsy revealed crescentic glomerulonephritis without deposition of immune complexes. Her serology was found to be MPO-ANCA-positive and cytoplasmic-ANCA-negative. Based of these findings, we diagnosed idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis. Following the initiation of steroid pulse therapy, her urinary protein excretion and renal function gradually improved in parallel with a decrease in the MPO-ANCA titer. Although steroid therapy effectively responded to their renal function without the withdrawal of PTU, it seems that PTU may be closely associated with the development of (MPO-ANCA)-related glomerulonephritis in this case. Therefore, hyperthyroidism patients treated with PTU should be paced under vigilant observation by monitoring their urinalysis and serum creatinine level.
The effects of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) on masseter muscles, when injected for cosmetic purposes (volumetric reduction) or treatment of excessive muscle activity (bruxism), have been investigated. However, the full anatomic effects of treatment are not known, particularly with respect to the mandible and relevant anthropometric measurements. The intent of this study was to use unilaterial BoNT/A injections to induce localized masseter atrophy and paresis and then to measure the effects of muscle influence on craniofacial growth and development.
Growing male Wistar rats, 30 days old, were studied. The experimental group consisted of 8 rats. One side of the masseter muscle was injected with BoNT/A and the other side of the masseter muscle was injected with saline. The side with BoNT/A belonged to 1 group and the side with saline was the sham group. Three rats without injections was the control. After 45 days, the masseter muscles were dissected and weighed. Dry skulls were prepared, and anthropometric measurements determined.
One-way ANOVA showed that the animals maintained their weight in both groups; however, the muscles injected with BoNT/A were smaller than the sham or control muscles. Anthropometric measurements of the bony structures attached to the masseter muscle showed a significant treatment effect.
After localized masseter muscle atrophy induced by BoNT/A injection, alterations of craniofacial bone growth and development were seen. The results agree with the functional matrix theory that soft tissues regulate bone growth.
The mechanisms by which resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) elicits diverse health benefits remain unclear because the intracellular target molecules of resveratrol are poorly defined. We screened resveratrol-binding proteins from lysates of MCF-7 breast cancer cells using resveratrol-affinity resin, which was constructed by immobilizing 4'-amino-3,5-dihydroxy-trans-stilbene on activated CH-Sepharose. On SDS-PAGE, two bands were detected as proteins that specifically bound to the resveratrol-affinity resin. One of these, a 30-kDa protein, was identified as human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) by hybrid linear ion trap/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Similarly, recombinant CBR1 bound to the resveratrol-affinity resin in the absence of resveratrol, but not in the presence of resveratrol. Among its activities, CBR1 catalyzes a NADPH-dependent reduction of the anticancer drug doxorubicin to the cardiotoxin doxorubicinol. The effects of doxorubicin on viability of MCF-7 cells were enhanced by resveratrol, 3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-trans-stilbene, 3,4'-dihydroxy-5-methoxy-trans-stilbene, and 4'-amino-3,5-dihydroxy-trans-stilbene at concentrations of 1 and 10 μM. Resveratrol and these derivatives inhibited CBR1 activities to a similar degree at concentrations of 100 and 200 μM. However, 3,5-dimethoxy-4'-hydroxy-trans-stilbene and m-hydroquinone had no influence on doxorubicin cytotoxicity or CBR1 activity. Resveratrol inhibited CBR1 activity through an apparent mix of competitive (Ki=55.8 μM) and noncompetitive (αKi=164 μM; α=2.98) inhibition kinetics. These results indicate that (i) resveratrol enhances the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin on MCF-7 cells; (ii) the moiety that contains the 3,5-dihydroxyl groups of resveratrol, but not the m-hydroquinone structure alone, is required to bind CBR1; and (iii) resveratrol acts as a mixed-type inhibitor of CBR1 activity on doxorubicin.
A 79-year-old woman presented with atrial flutter and anginal complaints, which remitted on nitroglycerin but the flutter did not respond to digoxin and verapamil. Flecainide acetate was given intravenously; administration was stopped because of development of a significant increase in the QRS duration, existence of prominent deep Q waves and marked ST elevation in leads V1 to V4. These abnormalities mimicked the ECG changes seen in myocardial infarction. However, the presence of an acute myocardial infarction could be ruled out. On a second admission intravenous flecainide acetate resulted in comparable marked ECG changes.
Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been implicated in Parkinson disease (PD). In addition, genetic evidence points to an important role of protein misfolding, aggregation, and failure in the proteasomal degradation of specific neuronal proteins in the pathogenesis of PD. The chaperone heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) reduces protein misfolding and aggregation and protects cells against a variety of adverse conditions, including oxidative stress. Moreover, Hsp70 exerts antiapoptotic activity by blocking the function of several key proapoptotic factors. Recently, Hsp70 was shown to inhibit alpha-synuclein toxicity in a Drosophila model of inherited PD. Here we tested the potential of Hsp70 (approved gene symbol HSPA1A) for gene therapy in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of idiopathic PD. We show that Hsp70 gene transfer to dopamine neurons by a recombinant adeno-associated virus significantly protects the mouse dopaminergic system against MPTP-induced dopamine neuron loss and the associated decline in striatal dopamine levels and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibers. Hsp70 reduced MPTP-induced apoptosis in the substantia nigra, and unilateral protection of the dopaminergic system by Hsp70 was associated with increased amphetamine-induced turning toward the uninjected side. Collectively, these results suggest that increasing chaperone activity may be beneficial for the treatment of idiopathic PD.
The effect of anti-hypertensive drug amlodipine on regression of cardiovascular hypertrophy due to hypertension was studied by using cultured smooth muscle cells derived from arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and measuring [3H]-TdR and [3H]-Leucine binding. 48 h after adding amlodipine, [3H]-TdR binding in arterial smooth muscle cells from SHR in vitro was reduced by 50.5% and [3H]-Leucine binding was reduced by 56.2% as compared with neuropeptide Y (NPY)-treated group. However, there was no significant change in cell number. The results showed that amlodipine could effectively inhibit increase of DNA and protein synthesis of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) due to NPY. It indicates that amlodipine is of great significance on regression of genesis and development of cardiovascular hypertrophy due to hypertension.
Two patients treated with parenteral paramethasone (Triniol) and dexamethasone (Sedionbel) are described. A few minutes after administration of the drugs, they presented urticaria (patients 1 and 2) and conjunctivitis (patient 1). The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid. Clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and ELISA tests were performed. In the two patients, skin and ELISA tests with paramethasone were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients. A single-blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients. We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them. These results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients. Corticosteroids different from paramethasone also produced hypersensitivity reactions in these patients; however, a few of them were tolerated. The basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pseudo-allergy caused by paramethasone.
Protective effects of an aged garlic extract on the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) was evaluated using the mouse. DOX (1.5 mg/kg body wt i.p.) was administered three times per week for 40 days. An aged garlic extract, WG-1 (a preserved stock solution; Wakunaga Pharmaceutical) was administered intraperitoneally six times weekly. DOX caused changes in the electrocardiogram. In the control mice, the width of the QRS complex was 20 +/- 2.8 milliseconds, the R-R interval was 130 +/- 2.8 milliseconds, and the P-Q interval was 30 +/- 1.4 milliseconds. In mice treated with DOX for 40 days, the width of the QRS complex was 50 +/- 10 milliseconds (p < 0.05), the R-R interval was 240 +/- 30 milliseconds (p < 0.05), and the P-Q interval was 45 +/- 1.0 milliseconds (p < 0.01). These values were significantly smaller in mice treated with WG-1 + DOX than in mice treated with DOX. The width of the QRS complex was 29.3 +/- 5.8 milliseconds (p < 0.05), the R-R interval was 145.8 +/- 17.9 milliseconds (p < 0.01), and the P-Q interval was 37.8 +/- 3.5 milliseconds (p < 0.05). The lipid peroxidation in the heart homogenates prepared from DOX-treated mice, as measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS, nmol malondialdehyde/100 mg protein) was 332.5 +/- 67.0, which was significantly larger than that in the control mice (186.6 +/- 42.2) (p < 0.05). WG-1 decreased the level of TBARS in DOX-treated mice significantly. In the mice treated with WG-1 + DOX, TBARS was 221.3 +/- 31.6, which was significantly smaller than that of DOX-treated mice (p < 0.05). Histological study demonstrated that the heart treated with DOX had vacuolization in muscle cells, disrupted myofibrils, and swollen mitochondria. Mice that received WG-1 + DOX had no significant pathological lesions in the heart.
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is thought to promote intracellular infection, including human visceral leishmaniasis, by disabling Th1 cell-type responses and/or deactivating parasitized tissue macrophages. To develop a rationale for IL-10 inhibition as treatment in visceral infection, Th1 cytokine-driven responses were characterized in Leishmania donovani-infected BALB/c mice in which IL-10 was absent or overexpressed or its receptor (IL-10R) was blockaded. IL-10 knockout and normal mice treated prophylactically with anti-IL-10R demonstrated accelerated granuloma assembly and rapid parasite killing without untoward tissue inflammation; IL-12 and gamma interferon mRNA expression, inducible nitric oxide synthase reactivity, and responsiveness to antimony chemotherapy were also enhanced in knockout mice. In IL-10 transgenic mice, parasite replication was unrestrained, and except for antimony responsiveness, measured Th1 cell-dependent events were all initially impaired. Despite subsequent granuloma assembly, high-level infection persisted, and antimony-treated transgenic mice also relapsed. In normal mice with established infection, anti-IL-10R treatment was remarkably active, inducing near-cure by itself and synergism with antimony. IL-10's deactivating effects regulate outcome in experimental visceral leishmaniasis, and IL-10R blockade represents a potential immuno- and/or immunochemotherapeutic approach in this infection.
Treatment of various tumor types with anthracycl in cytostatic drugs (DNR--daunorubicin and DOX--doxorubicin) is limited by their high cardiotoxicity. This study was aimed at examining effectiveness of histopathological appraisal of myocardial cell injury induced by the cytostatic drugs and evaluated according to Billingham and by MTS methods as compared to results of parallel biochemical assessment of lipid peroxidation indices (MDA- malonyldialdehyde, 4-HDA-4-hydroxyalkenes). The experiments were performed on rats intoxicated with DNR or DOX in an acute manner (1 x 10 mg/kg body weight, i.v.) or a subchronic manner (3 x 3 mg/kg body weight. i.v.). Significant positive correlations were demonstrated between results of histological and biochemical appraisal in rats intoxicated in the acute manner with DNR (r=(0.91), intoxicated in the subchronic manner with DNR (r=0.90) and in rats intoxicated in the acute or subchronic manner with DOX (r=0.91, r=0.77, respectively). The obtained results have confirmed the free radical mechanism of cardiomyocyte injury induced by anthracyclines and the applied techniques of evaluating the destruction may be used independently of each other.
We tested the efficacy and safety of oral fludarabine and cyclophosphamide as front-line therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and assessed the influence of immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IgVH) gene mutation status, interphase cytogenetic abnormalities, and expression of ZAP-70 and CD38 on clinical outcome. Thirty-seven patients with previously untreated CLL received oral fludarabine (30 mg m(2)) and oral cyclophosphamide (250 mg m(2)) for three consecutive days every 4 weeks for six cycles. Eighteen patients had unmutated and 15 had mutated IgVH genes. Nine patients had the 'high risk' cytogenetic abnormality del(11q22.3) or del(17p13.1). Fifteen patients were ZAP-70-positive and eight patients were CD38-positive. Among the 35 valuable patients, 14 patients (40%) obtained a complete response and 13 (37%) a partial response. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 23 months and median time to re-treatment (TTR) was 38 months. A significantly lower overall response rate (43% vs. 85%, p = 0.011), a shorter PFS (22 vs. 27 months, p = 0.015), and a shorter TTR (22 vs. 40 months, p = 0.031) were noticed in the 'high risk' cytogenetic abnormalities group; TTR was also shorter in IgVH-unmutated than in IgVH-mutated patients (26 vs. 41 months, p = 0.035). Hematologic toxicity included grade IV neutropenia (ten patients) and grade III/IV anemia (three patients). Gastrointestinal toxicity was mild and no patient required hospitalization. The oral combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated regimen that, if confirmed with larger series, will be appropriate especially in patients with low risk biological parameters.
Three cases of multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide are presented which highlight therapeutic dilemmas presented by therapy with this new agent. The difficulty of stem cell collection during thalidomide therapy is illustrated. The question of continuation of thalidomide after attainment of a plateau or remission is discussed and the management of neuropathy considered. Thalidomide, being a novel drug, presents a number of therapeutic issues that have yet to be resolved.
The gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) on chromosome 19 is the only confirmed susceptibility locus for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. To identify other risk loci, we conducted a large genome-wide association study of 2,032 individuals from France with Alzheimer's disease (cases) and 5,328 controls. Markers outside APOE with suggestive evidence of association (P < 10(-5)) were examined in collections from Belgium, Finland, Italy and Spain totaling 3,978 Alzheimer's disease cases and 3,297 controls. Two loci gave replicated evidence of association: one within CLU (also called APOJ), encoding clusterin or apolipoprotein J, on chromosome 8 (rs11136000, OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.90, P = 7.5 x 10(-9) for combined data) and the other within CR1, encoding the complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1, on chromosome 1 (rs6656401, OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.14-1.29, P = 3.7 x 10(-9) for combined data). Previous biological studies support roles of CLU and CR1 in the clearance of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide, the principal constituent of amyloid plaques, which are one of the major brain lesions of individuals with Alzheimer's disease.
We report a case of angioedema limited to the nape of the neck. The symptoms occurred every morning for fifteen days, two or three hours after taking aspirin. The patient took salicylic acid, 100mg per day, orally for two years. The angioedema occurred alone, without urticaria. When aspirin was stopped, the symptoms disappeared. A few weeks later, the patient took napoxen, with occurrence of more pronounced symptoms. The causality score was I3 for both drugs. The most common side-effects of aspirin intake are asthma and urticaria/angioedema. The mechanism of this hypersensitivity is unknown. There are numerous cross-reactions between aspirin and other NSAIDs. This case points out the importance of accurate history taking concerning self-medication for the diagnosis of angioedema.
The lateral segment of the globus pallidus (GPl) is thought to be overactive in levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD. Stimulation of cannabinoid receptors in the GPl reduces gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake and enhances GABA transmission and may thus alleviate dyskinesia. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (n = 7), the authors demonstrate that the cannabinoid receptor agonist nabilone significantly reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD.
We conducted a genome-wide association study among 2,323 individuals with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 9,013 control subjects and evaluated all SNPs with P < 1.0 x 10(-4) in a second, independent cohort of 2,532 affected individuals and 5,940 controls. Analysis of the genome-wide data revealed genome-wide significance for one SNP, rs12608932, with P = 1.30 x 10(-9). This SNP showed robust replication in the second cohort (P = 1.86 x 10(-6)), and a combined analysis over the two stages yielded P = 2.53 x 10(-14). The rs12608932 SNP is located at 19p13.3 and maps to a haplotype block within the boundaries of UNC13A, which regulates the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate at neuromuscular synapses. Follow-up of additional SNPs showed genome-wide significance for two further SNPs (rs2814707, with P = 7.45 x 10(-9), and rs3849942, with P = 1.01 x 10(-8)) in the combined analysis of both stages. These SNPs are located at chromosome 9p21.2, in a linkage region for familial ALS with frontotemporal dementia found previously in several large pedigrees.
The most frequently encountered doxorubicin related cardiac toxicity is a dose-related myocardial dysfunction occurring 1-6 months after chemotherapy. Recently, late cardiotoxicity has been the focus of interest. This paper explores the possibility that acute intercurrent viral illness may trigger late cardiotoxicity.
Thirty selected pediatric patients were followed for changes in their echocardiographically measured fractional shortening (FS) for 2-10 years after completion of their doxorubicin chemotherapy. They were divided according to the dose of doxorubicin they received (< 300 mg/m2 or > or = 300 mg/m2) and to whether the manifestations of an acute intercurrent viral illness during the observation period were documented. Eleven patients experienced such infections.
Changes in FS demonstrated two different responses. The usual response to doxorubicin was a gradual, dose-related fall in FS, followed by recovery; while the second response included an unexpected, late, sudden decrease in FS. Four patients in the low dose subgroup experienced an acute intercurrent viral illness, but none of these demonstrated the unexpected decrease. Of the seven patients who acquired such illness in the high dose subgroup, five demonstrated the sudden, late decrease in FS, with two of them developing severe, reversible congestive heart failure.
The most likely explanation for the late, sudden decrease in FS is an additional stress in patients who already have sustained subclinical cardiac damage as a result of their doxorubicin chemotherapy. An acute intercurrent viral illness may have triggered late cardiac dysfunction in some of these patients.
Fifty-nine colorectal cancer patients with metastatic liver cancer who underwent intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (IAIC) at the National Cancer Center Hospital from May 1986 to February 1989 were reviewed. Excisions of metastatic liver cancer were performed in 36 patients and 23 had nonresectable metastatic liver cancer. Catheter troubles, including severe infections (8), extravasations (3), obstruction (1) and other (1) occurred in 13 (22.0%) patients, and 6 patients (10.2%) were unable to receive IAIC. Three patients did not undergo IAIC because of hepatitis or other reasons. Serious complications following IAIC, including sclerosing cholangitis (SC) (6), extravasations (6) and obstructions (3) were observed in 15 patients (30.0%). 5-Flourouracil (5-FU) (700 mg/m2) and mitomycin C (MMC) (7 mg/m2) were infused through implantable pumps weekly or every two weeks. Total infused doses of 5-FU ranged from 7,000 to 26,250 mg (mean: 11,800 + 7,700 mg) and those of MMC from 24 to 84 mg (mean: 45.3 + 25.8 mg) in 6 patients (12%) with SC, 4 resectable and 2 non-resectable cases. All six patients with SC had cholangiographic abnormalities of the biliary tract by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), but serial CT examination of the liver did not show any progression of the tumor at the hilum in these patients. Segmental stricture at the common hepatic duct and bifurcation appeared specific to IA-5-FU induced SC. Obstructive jaundice occurred in 3 patients. Four patients had epigastralgia and 3 exhibited elevated alkaline phosphatase level prior to the cholangiographic examination. The elevated level of alkaline phosphatase was reversible in one patient without obstructive jaundice. Although the relation of the sclerosing process to IA-5-FU dose is not yet clear as well as IA-FUDR, it should be important to make an early detection of SC by ERCP and also to discontinue IAIC as soon as possible. In our opinion, SC may relate to the arterial delivery of 5-FU. In order to prevent SC, devascularization of the right hepatic artery via surgical procedures may well be effective, because retrograde flow from the right hepatic artery was confirmed by several clinical and anatomical studies.
We undertook a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involving over 16,000 individuals, the most powerful AD GWAS to date. In stage 1 (3,941 cases and 7,848 controls), we replicated the established association with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus (most significant SNP, rs2075650, P = 1.8 x 10(-157)) and observed genome-wide significant association with SNPs at two loci not previously associated with the disease: at the CLU (also known as APOJ) gene (rs11136000, P = 1.4 x 10(-9)) and 5' to the PICALM gene (rs3851179, P = 1.9 x 10(-8)). These associations were replicated in stage 2 (2,023 cases and 2,340 controls), producing compelling evidence for association with Alzheimer's disease in the combined dataset (rs11136000, P = 8.5 x 10(-10), odds ratio = 0.86; rs3851179, P = 1.3 x 10(-9), odds ratio = 0.86).
Schizophrenia is associated with a blunted flush response to niacin. Since niacin-induced skin flushing is mediated by vasodilators derived from arachidonic acid (AA), we tested whether the blunted flush response to niacin is a marker of AA deficiency.
Eight concentrations of methylnicotinate were applied to the forearms of 20 adults with schizophrenia and 20 controls. Laser Doppler measurement of blood flow responses was used to derive values for niacin sensitivity (defined as the concentration eliciting half-maximal response, i.e., EC(50) value) and efficacy (defined as the maximal evoked blood flow response). RBC membrane fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography.
Niacin sensitivity and efficacy were reduced in schizophrenia. In the control group, there was significant correlation between AA levels and niacin sensitivity as well as a trend toward correlation between AA levels and niacin efficacy. In contrast, neither sensitivity nor efficacy of niacin correlated with AA levels in schizophrenia. An expected correlation between the levels of AA and its elongation product (adrenic acid) was absent in schizophrenia. Adrenic acid levels correlated with niacin efficacy in schizophrenia.
The schizophrenia-associated niacin response abnormality involves both diminished sensitivity and reduced efficacy. The lack of expected correlation between levels of AA and adrenic acid suggests homeostatic imbalance within the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) pathway in schizophrenia. Though AA levels were unrelated to measures of niacin response in schizophrenia, the correlation between adrenic acid and niacin efficacy in schizophrenia suggests relevance of the n-6 PUFA pathway to the blunted niacin response.
Genome-wide association studies have identified common variants that only partially explain the genetic risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using genome-wide association data from 1,376 French individuals, we identified 16,360 SNPs nominally associated with T2D and studied these SNPs in an independent sample of 4,977 French individuals. We then selected the 28 best hits for replication in 7,698 Danish subjects and identified 4 SNPs showing strong association with T2D, one of which (rs2943641, P = 9.3 x 10(-12), OR = 1.19) was located adjacent to the insulin receptor substrate 1 gene (IRS1). Unlike previously reported T2D risk loci, which predominantly associate with impaired beta cell function, the C allele of rs2943641 was associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in 14,358 French, Danish and Finnish participants from population-based cohorts; this allele was also associated with reduced basal levels of IRS1 protein and decreased insulin induction of IRS1-associated phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase activity in human skeletal muscle biopsies.
The TNFRSF1B gene, which encodes the p75 TNF receptor, is a strong functional and positional candidate gene for susceptibility to osteoporosis. In a previous study, we reported that polymorphic variation in the 3' untranslated region of TNFRSF1B was associated with femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) in a population-based cohort of Scottish women. In order to further explore the role of TNFRSF1B as a candidate gene for osteoporosis, we have now studied the relationship between a promoter polymorphism in the TNFRSF1B gene and BMD, and determined whether this polymorphism interacts with other polymorphisms in TNFRSF1B to regulate bone mass, bone loss, and osteoporotic fracture. Analysis of individual polymorphisms showed weak associations between the G593A, T598G and T620C polymorphisms and femoral neck BMD (P=0.05-0.017). On haplotype analysis, the only significant association we observed was with FN BMD when haplotypes were grouped according to presence or absence of A593-T598-C620 alleles in the 3' UTR (0.897+/-0.005 versus 0.841+/-0.01; P<0.0001). These data show that allelic variation within the TNFRSF1B gene contributes to the genetic regulation of FN-BMD and show that it is the ATC haplotype in the 3'UTR region of the gene, rather than other polymorphic variants, that seem to be responsible for the effects observed.
Although nicotine has been implicated as a potential factor in the pathogenesis of cancer in humans, its mechanism of action in the development of cancer remains largely unknown. Growing evidence indicates that the induction of apoptosis is an important mechanism in the prevention of cancer development. In the study presented here, we examined the effects of nicotine on the process of apoptosis. Preincubation of human cells with nicotine completely inhibited ultraviolet light (UV)-induced apoptosis. The inhibition of apoptosis by nicotine was correlated with the prevention of cytochrome c release and caspase activation, which are essential components of the UV-induced apoptotic pathway. Thus, our results suggest that the inhibition of apoptosis by nicotine contributes to the increased incidence of cancer in smokers.
We used a novel computerized decision-making task to compare the decision-making behavior of chronic amphetamine abusers, chronic opiate abusers, and patients with focal lesions of orbital prefrontal cortex (PFC) or dorsolateral/medial PFC. We also assessed the effects of reducing central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) activity using a tryptophan-depleting amino acid drink in normal volunteers. Chronic amphetamine abusers showed suboptimal decisions (correlated with years of abuse), and deliberated for significantly longer before making their choices. The opiate abusers exhibited only the second of these behavioral changes. Importantly, both sub-optimal choices and increased deliberation times were evident in the patients with damage to orbitofrontal PFC but not other sectors of PFC. Qualitatively, the performance of the subjects with lowered plasma tryptophan was similar to that associated with amphetamine abuse, consistent with recent reports of depleted 5-HT in the orbital regions of PFC of methamphetamine abusers. Overall, these data suggest that chronic amphetamine abusers show similar decision-making deficits to those seen after focal damage to orbitofrontal PFC. These deficits may reflect altered neuromodulation of the orbitofrontal PFC and interconnected limbic-striatal systems by both the ascending 5-HT and mesocortical dopamine (DA) projections.
Organophosphate poisoning has a high mortality rate. Recently, differences among organophosphorus insecticides in human self-poisoning were reported. This study investigated the prognostic risk factors and the mortality of different organophosphates following acute organophosphate poisoning.
This retrospective study included 68 patients with acute organophosphate poisoning. We investigated patient survival according to initial parameters, including the initial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, serum cholinesterase level, and hemoperfusion and evaluated the mortality according to organophosphate types.
Thirteen of the 68 patients died. The agents responsible for mortality were different. The APACHE II score was a significant predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.194; p<0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.089 to 1.309) and respiratory failure (OR, 1.273; p<0.01; 95% CI, 1.122 to 1.444). The mortality was 0% for dichlorvos, malathion, chlorpyrifos and profenofos. However, other organophosphates showed different mortality (16.7% for O-ethyl-O-4-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonothioate, 25% for phenthoate, 37.5% for phosphamidon, 50% for methidathion). The usefulness of hemoperfusion appears to be limited.
The initial APACHE II score is a useful prognostic indicator, and different organophosphates have different mortality.
In three experiments, behavioral toxicity induced by 5 different dose levels of digitoxin was investigated in mice that were treated with either clonidine or propranolol or were either young (70-140 days), middle aged (240-260) or old (450-600). Observed on four drug-induced behavior categories, it was found that both clonidine and propranolol attenuated the toxic effects of relatively low dose levels of digitoxin, while at higher digitoxin dose levels only propranolol was able to reduce significantly the ED50 and the LD50. The results were discussed in terms of adrenergic mechanisms mediating digitoxin toxicity. Aged mice were found to be the least and middle aged the most resistant to the toxic effects of digitoxin.
An association between use of zidovudine and didanosine and a rare but life-threatening syndrome of hepatic steatosis, lactic acidosis, and myopathy has been reported.
To describe the syndrome of hepatic steatosis, lactic acidosis, and myopathy in four patients taking stavudine.
Case series.
A community hospital in Washington, D.C., and National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland.
Two men and two women with HIV-1 infection who were taking stavudine presented with lactic acidosis and elevated levels of aminotransferases. All patients required intensive care.
Levels of lactic acid, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, amylase, and lipase; computed tomography of the abdomen; liver biopsy (two patients); and muscle biopsy (two patients).
Histologic findings consistent with mitochondrial injury confirmed the diagnosis of hepatic or muscle abnormality.
Because hepatic steatosis may be life-threatening, physicians should consider it as a possible cause of elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels among patients taking stavudine.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a highly aggressive form of solid tumor, has been increasing in South East Asia. The lack of effective therapy necessitates the introduction of novel chemopreventive strategies to counter the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Recently, we reported that dimethoxy flavone (DMF), a methylated flavone derived from chrysin, significantly suppressed the development of preneoplastic lesions induced by N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) in rats, although the mechanism of action was not known. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of DMF administration on gene expression changes related to the inflammation-mediated NF-kB pathway, Wnt pathway and apoptotic mediators in DEN-induced preneoplastic nodules. There was a significant increase in inflammatory markers like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and a decrease in apoptotic mediators like p53, caspase-3 and bax in DEN-treated rats when compared to the control group. Activation of NF-kB was noticed by an elevated expression of nuclear protein expression of NF-kB and cytoplasmic phospho-IkBαSer(32/36) in the same animals. Likewise, upregulation of canonical Wnt pathway was noticed by elevated expression of nuclear protein levels of phospho-β-cateninThr(393) and cytoplasmic casein kinase-2 (CK2), Dvl2 and cyclin D1 levels, along with a simultaneous decrease in expression of phospho-GSK3β(Ser9). Dietary DMF (100mg/kg) administration inhibited liver nodule incidence and multiplicity by 82% and 78%, respectively. DMF also reversed the activation of NF-kB and Wnt pathway as shown by the decrease in protein expression of several proteins. Results of the present investigation provide evidence that attenuation of Wnt pathway and suppression of inflammatory response mediated by NF-kB could be implicated, in part, in the chemopreventive effects of methylated flavone. Therefore, the present findings hold great promise for the utilization of DMF as an effective chemotherapeutic agent in treating early stages of liver cancer.
