Four derivatives of betulin containing a D-glucopyranosyl moiety at C3 position were synthesized and characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry. The crystal structure of 28-O-acetylbetulin-3-yl-beta-D-(2',3',4',6'-tetra-O-acetyl)glucopyranoside was determined. The compounds were tested against fifteen tumor cell lines of different histogenic origins. The alpha- and beta-anomers of 28-O-acetylbetulin-3-yl-D-glucopyranoside, exerted a dose dependent antiproliferative action towards the tumor cell lines. Treatment of HCT-116 cells for 24h induced apoptosis, which was confirmed by the appearance of a typical ladder pattern in the DNA fragmentation assay and cell cycle analysis. The alpha- and beta-anomers of 28-O-acetylbetulin-3-yl-D-glucopyranoside seem to induce apoptosis by activation of different upstream caspases on colon cancer HCT-116 cell line.
Smokers incur a sustained free radical load that may increase their vitamin E requirement. Erythrocytes of male smokers from a Scottish population with a habitually low vitamin E intake were more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide-stimulated peroxidation than were those from nonsmokers (P < 0.001). Plasma concentrations of lipid peroxides, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and conjugated dienes were also elevated in smokers compared with nonsmokers (P < 0.05). These indexes of oxidative stress were markedly decreased (P < 0.001) in the smokers and nonsmokers after consumption of 280 mg dl-alpha tocopherol acetate/d for 10 wk. Platelet numbers in serum of both smokers and nonsmokers were also decreased by vitamin E supplementation (P < 0.02). Although the clinical significance of the results is unclear, elevated indexes of lipid peroxidation are associated with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and platelets are involved with fibrinolysis. Therefore, both smokers and non-smokers may benefit from increased vitamin E intakes.
AlstrÃ¶m syndrome (ALMS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ALMS1 gene. We report two brothers, 3 and 4 years of age and diagnosed with ALMS, who initially presented in infancy with severe dilated cardiomyopathy during febrile respiratory infection. The disease course in the two siblings was marked by significant intrafamilial variability. Although cardiomyopathy in the older sibling has mainly resolved thus allowing for the discontinuation of medical therapy, heart function in the younger sibling continues to deteriorate despite maximal drug support with furosemide, carvedilol, captopril, and aldospirone. Genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations, c.8008C>T (R2670X), in ALMS1 resulting in premature protein truncation. This report further emphasizes the exceptional intrafamilial variability of ALMS, mainly during the natural course of cardiac disease.
Busulfan is known to be neurotoxic in animals and humans, but its acute neurotoxicity remains poorly characterized in children. We report here a retrospective study of 123 children (median age, 6.5 years) receiving high-dose busulfan in combined chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation for malignant solid tumors, brain tumors excluded. Busulfan was given p.o., every 6 hours for 16 doses over 4 days. Two total doses were consecutively used: 16 mg/kg, then 600 mg/m2. The dose calculation on the basis of body surface area results in higher doses in young children than in older patients (16 to 28 mg/kg). Ninety-six patients were not given anticonvulsive prophylaxis; 7 (7.5%) developed seizures during the 4 days of the busulfan course or within 24 h after the last dosing. When the total busulfan dose was taken into account, there was a significant difference in terms of neurotoxicity incidence among patients under 16 mg/kg (1 of 57, 1.7%) and patients under 600 mg/m2 (6 of 39, 15.4%) (P less than 0.02). Twenty-seven patients were given a 600-mg/m2 busulfan total dose with continuous i.v. infusion of clonazepam; none had any neurological symptoms. Busulfan levels were measured by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry assay in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of 9 children without central nervous system disease under 600 mg/m2 busulfan with clonazepam:busulfan cerebrospinal fluid:plasma ratio was 1.39. This was significantly different (P less than 0.02) from the cerebrospinal fluid:plasma ratio previously defined in children receiving a 16-mg/kg total dose of busulfan. This study shows that busulfan neurotoxicity is dose-dependent in children and efficiently prevented by clonazepam. A busulfan dose calculated on the basis of body surface area, resulting in higher doses in young children, was followed by increased neurotoxicity, close to neurotoxicity incidence observed in adults. Since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster busulfan clearance in children than in adults, this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16-mg/kg total dose, with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effects. The busulfan dose in children and infants undergoing bone marrow transplantation should be reconsidered on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies.
Several reports have suggested indomethacin administration causes necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in infants. Few experimental studies have addressed this relationship. We studied the effects of indomethacin after temporary intestinal ischemia in CD-1 mice, using a previously reported method of simulating NEC in mice. This involved occlusion of both superior mesenteric vessels for 15 minutes. Three groups were studied. In group 1, 12 mice had superior mesenteric vessels occluded for 15 minutes, followed by intravenous (IV) administration of saline for three doses over 3 days. In group 2, 12 mice had sham laparotomy, without occlusion of vessels, followed by IV administration of indomethacin for three doses over 3 days. In group 3, 36 mice had mesenteric vessel occlusion for 15 minutes, followed by IV administration of indomethacin for three doses over 3 days. The results were as follows: group 1, bowel necrosis developed in 1 of 12 animals (8%); group 2, all 12 animals survived without bowel damage (0%); and group 3, 22 of 36 animals developed bowel necrosis (61%) (Fisher's Exact Test: occlusion alone v occlusion and indomethacin, P = .002; indomethacin alone v occlusion and indomethacin, P = .00015.) We conclude that whereas occlusion alone or indomethacin alone does not cause bowel necrosis, temporary intestinal occlusion followed by indomethacin causes bowel necrosis in over 60% of animals studied. In the shocked preterm infant who may have suffered temporary intestinal ischemia, administration of indomethacin may be the second step to development of NEC.
Local venous reactions during and after i.v injections of three different formulations of diazepam were studied in 200 patients undergoing gastroscopy. Of the patients receiving diazepam in propylene glycol (Stesolid) 78% experienced pain on injection and 48% subsequently developed clinical evidence of thrombophlebitis. The figures for Stesolid MR (diazepam in Cremophor EL) were 38% and 9% respectively. A significant decrease was achieved (pain on injection 1%; clinical thrombophlebitis 4%) when using Diazemuls, a new formulation in which diazepam is dissolved in oil and emulsified in water. Since no difference in the therapeutic effect of the different formulations was observed, Diazemuls represents a clear advantage to Stesolid and Stesolid MR.
To study the role of the striatum in modulating the effects of adenosine agonists and benzodiazepine inverse agonists on acute ethanol-induced motor impairment, we evaluated the effect of direct intrastriatal Ro15-4513 [0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 ng], a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptor, on ethanol-induced motor incoordination. A significant and nearly dose-dependent antagonism by Ro15-4513 was observed, which suggests involvement of the striatum in ethanol-induced motor incoordination. No effect of IST Ro15-4513 on motor incoordination induced by Na-pentobarbital (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was noted, indicating the selectivity of the antiethanol action of Ro15-4513. The IST adenosine agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) markedly accentuated ethanol-induced motor incoordination in a dose-related manner, suggesting a striatal adenosinergic modulation of ethanol-induced motor incoordination. The IST Ro15-4513 also significantly antagonized the accentuating effects of CHA on ethanol-induced motor incoordination. No change in normal motor coordination was observed after IST CHA or Ro15-4513 when followed by saline administration instead of ethanol. No accentuating effect by intrahippocampal CHA on ethanol-induced motor incoordination was seen, which suggests the selectivity of striatal adenosinergic modulation of ethanol-induced motor incoordination. There was no significant radioactivity present in the systemic circulation, in the CSF or in brain areas other than striatum after intrastriatal [3H]Ro15-4513 or [3H]CHA and ethanol injection. Data obtained so far support the involvement of striatum in ethanol's ataxia as well as striatal adenosinergic modulation of the central effect(s) of ethanol, possibly through Ro15-4513-sensitive mechanism(s).
To assess the effect of maternal CYP2D6, CYP3A5, ABCB1, and OPRM1 polymorphisms in predicting both neonatal and maternal central nervous system depression after oxycodone use during lactation.
A nested case-control study in 67 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs exposed to oxycodone was conducted. Cases were defined as parental reports of lethargy in the infant temporally related to oxycodone exposure via breastmilk. Maternal saliva samples were analyzed for 18 polymorphisms in 4 genes, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, OPRM1, ABCB1, involved in oxycodone metabolism and response.
Mothers of symptomatic infants were using oxycodone for a longer period of time during breastfeeding compared with those of asymptomatic infants (P < 0.0001). None of the maternal genetic variants in the 4 genes were associated with oxycodone-induced depression in neonates. However, mothers carrying at least one copy of the ABCB1 2677 T variant had an increased risk of experiencing sedation themselves (odds ratio, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-5.28; P = 0.03).
The ABCB1 2677 T variant may predict oxycodone-induced central nervous system depression in breastfeeding mothers.
To elucidate the mechanism of propofol-induced pain on injection, we performed several studies using nafamostat mesilate, a kallikrein inhibitor, or lidocaine. As both pretreatment and low-dose mixing with nafamostat produced the same effects on pain reduction, we used the latter method in the following experiments. Low-dose mixing had the same effect on injection pain as mixing with lidocaine. The extent of pain was assessed by measuring bradykinin concentrations by mixing with blood. Propofol and its lipid solvent mixed with blood produced approximately two-fold generation of bradykinin compared with the saline control, and this was inhibited completely by nafamostat and lidocaine. Injection of the lipid solvent before propofol significantly aggravated pain compared with prior injection of saline, although the lipid solvent injected twice caused no change in pain. These results suggest that the lipid solvent for propofol activates the plasma kallikrein-kinin system and produces bradykinin which modifies the injected local vein. This modification of the peripheral vein may increase the contact between the aqueous phase propofol and the free nerve endings of the vessel, resulting in aggravation of propofol-induced pain.
Propofol has cerebral vascular and metabolic effects similar to those of barbiturates, and it is used to maintain neurosurgical anesthesia because it reduces cerebral metabolic rate, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial pressure. Although the use of propofol as a cerebral protectant during certain neurosurgical procedures has been advocated, consensus has not been reached as to a protective effect of propofol on cerebral ischemia. In this study we observed the neuroprotective effects of propofol during global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by the use of four-vessel occlusion method in a rat model. We measured the levels of malondialdehyde as a marker of lipid peroxidation in ischemic tissue, and the results indicate that propofol plays a role in the inhibition of neuronal death induced by brain ischemia.
The tolerability of four doses of intravenous nicardipine (0.03, 0.08, 0.11, and 0.15 mg/kg/h) was assessed in this randomized multicenter, parallel-group study. Fifty-two patients with Hunt and Hess grade I-III aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were treated with intravenous nicardipine beginning within 4 days of bleeding, for a mean duration of 12.6 days; this treatment was followed by administration of oral nicardipine 90-120 mg until day 30. Hypotension was the main side effect, and it occurred only in the two groups that received the highest doses. However, it was possible to continue nicardipine in all cases at lower doses or even without modification, and hypotension was never responsible for any deleterious clinical effect.
The restriction on the use of third-generation oral contraceptives, pills which contain gestodene and desogestrel, has been lifted, and the pills can now be offered to women who want to use the method. The Committee on Safety of Medicine imposed the 1995 restriction after a study suggested a small increase in the risk of deep vein thrombosis. But after extensive research, the Medicines Commission stated that third generation pills can be prescribed to women provided that they will be informed of the greater risk involved. In addition, third-generation pills would contain new package inserts, explaining the risks of deep vein thrombosis. The warning will state that the risk of deep vein thrombosis in women not taking the pill is 5/100,000 women/year. This risk increases to 15/100,000 women/year in women taking second-generation pills, while it is 25/100,000 women/year in women taking third-generation pills.
Streptomycin is the antibiotic of choice to treat tuberculosis and other infectious diseases but it causes vestibular malfunction and hipoacusia. Rodents are usually employed as models of drug action to the inner ear and results are extrapolated to what happens in humans. In rats, streptomycin destroys macular sensory cells and does not affect cochlear ones, whereas in guinea pigs the contrary is true. Action on the vestibular cristae cells involved in vestibulo-ocular reflex integrity is less clear. Thus, we compared this response in both pigmented guinea pigs (Cavia cobaya) and rats (Rattus norvegicus) after parallel streptomycin chronic treatment. In guinea pigs, the reflex was obliterated along treatment time; in rats this behavior was not observed, suggesting that the end organ target was diverse. In recent studies, streptidine, a streptomycin derivative found in the blood of humans and rats treated with streptomycin, was the actual ototoxic agent. The putative streptomycin vestibular organ target observed in humans corresponds with the guinea pig observations. Results observed in rats are controversial: streptidine did not cause any damage either to vestibular cristae nor auditory cells. We hypothesize differential drug metabolism and distribution and conclude that results in laboratory animals may not always be applicable in the human situation.
The pharmacokinetics, analgesic efficacy, and irritancy potential of Buprederm, a new transdermal delivery system of buprenorphine, was evaluated.
Single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in mice and rabbits. The analgesic efficacy and skin irritation potential were determined by tail flick and writhing tests in mice and by the Draize dermal scoring system in rabbits.
Fast absorption of buprenorphine into the bloodstream was observed in mice and rabbits after Buprederm application. The peak buprenorphine level in plasma was achieved between 1 and 24 h, and the effective therapeutic drug concentration was maintained for 72 h. No significant accumulation of buprenorphine was seen after multiple consecutive applications of patches to rabbits with a 4-day dosing interval. Buprederm induced prolongation of tail-flick latency in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Maximum analgesic effect was attained between 3 and 6 h and was maintained for 24 h after patch application. No skin irritation was demonstrated in rabbits after repeated Buprederm application.
Buprederm was shown to be efficacious by achieving the effective buprenorphine concentration in the blood and brain sufficient to maintain an analgesic effect for 72 h, and was also shown to be safe following multiple applications.
Formation of coronary aneurysm is a rare complication of stenting with bare metal stents, but based on experimental studies drug-eluting stents may induce toxic effects on the vessel wall with incomplete stent apposition, aneurysm formation and with the potential of stent thrombosis or vessel rupture. We present a 43-year-old man who developed a coronary aneurysm in the right coronary artery 6 months after receiving a paclitaxel-eluting stent. The patient was asymptomatic and the aneurysm was detected in a routine control. Angiography and intracoronary ultrasound demonstrated lack of contact between stent and vessel wall in a 15-mm long segment with maximal aneurysm diameter of 6.0 mm. The patient was successfully treated with a graft stent.
Bone tissue homeostasis is governed by hormones, growth factors, and cytokines and can be distorted by environmental pollutants, such as ligands to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). A transgenic mouse expressing a constitutively active aryl hydrocarbon receptor (CA-AhR), mimicking continuous low-dose exposure to AhR ligands, was used to explore potential long-term effects of these ligands on bone. The density, content, and dimensions of cortical and trabecular bone, as well as physical properties, were significantly altered in female transgenic mice, while almost no alterations were detected in males. Osteoclast volume density and serum level of C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), reflecting osteoclast activity, were both increased by approximately 60% in female CA-AhR mice, while serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 5b, reflecting osteoclast numbers, was unchanged. Subsequently, the resorption index (CTX/TRAP 5b) was increased by 90%, indicating increased osteoclast activity in female CA-AhR. Moreover, the protein level of the osteoclast collagenase cathepsin K was increased by 40% in bone extracts of female CA-AhR mice. The messenger RNA expression of several osteoclast- and osteoblast-associated genes was altered in female transgenic mice but not in males. Notably, early markers for osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation were normal, while the expression of functional markers of osteoclasts and osteoblasts were reduced. In conclusion, a low continuous activation of the AhR leads to a skeletal phenotype with increased bone resorption associated with more ductile bones in females but not in males. The results indicate the presence of an interaction between the AhR and a female-specific mechanism implicated in inhibition of osteoclast development and function. Female bone tissue appears more susceptible to dioxins and other AhR ligands than male bone tissue.
Ifosfamide, a chemotherapeutic agent, offers new hope as well as new problems for the uro-oncologist. The "good news" is that this drug is achieving marked benefits in treating resistant testis tumors and may even hold hope for patients with renal cell carcinoma. The "bad news" is that a price must be paid in toxicity--predominantly a severe and restrictive hemorrhagic cystitis. A breakthrough is the finding that oral administration of acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) may, to a large extent, prevent this untoward side effect.
The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) plays an important role in the regulation of cellular responses in multiple organs by mediating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) signaling pathway through activating AGC kinases. Here we defined the role of PDK1 in controlling cardiac homeostasis. Cardiac expression of PDK1 was significantly decreased in murine models of heart failure. Tamoxifen-inducible and heart-specific disruption of Pdk1 in adult mice caused severe and lethal heart failure, which was associated with apoptotic death of cardiomyocytes and beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (AR) down-regulation. Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein prevented cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improved cardiac function. In addition, PDK1-deficient hearts showed enhanced activity of PI3-Kgamma, leading to robust beta(1)-AR internalization by forming complex with beta-AR kinase 1 (betaARK1). Interference of betaARK1/PI3-Kgamma complex formation by transgenic overexpression of phosphoinositide kinase domain normalized beta(1)-AR trafficking and improved cardiac function. Taken together, these results suggest that PDK1 plays a critical role in cardiac homeostasis in vivo by serving as a dual effector for cell survival and beta-adrenergic response.
The majority of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection suffer from disabling fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and quality of life reduction. Meanwhile, there is increasing evidence that HCV infection can affect brain function. Recent studies have shown that fatigue and psychomotor slowing may resolve in patients with hepatitis C after treatment with ondansetron. This observation indicates alteration of serotonergic neurotransmission in HCV infected patients with chronic fatigue.
Data from 20 HCV infected patients who were referred to our clinic because of disabling fatigue and cognitive decline of unknown cause were analysed retrospectively. Patients had undergone a diagnostic programme, including clinical and psychometric examination, electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and I-123-beta-CIT (2beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-[(123)I]iodophenyl)tropane) single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) studies of serotonin and dopamine transporter binding capacity.
All patients had pathological results on the fatigue impact scale. Two thirds of patients showed pathological attention test results. EEG, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. Pathological dopamine transporter binding was present in 12/20 (60%) patients and pathological serotonin transporter binding in 8/19 (50%) patients. Patients with normal SPECT results did not significantly differ from controls with regard to psychometric test results. Interestingly, patients with both decreased serotonin and dopamine transporter binding showed significantly impaired performance in most of the tests applied. Comorbidity that could have impaired cerebral function was excluded in all patients.
Our findings indicate alteration of serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in HCV infected patients with chronic fatigue and cognitive impairment.
1. Adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) administration produces an adrenally dependent rise in blood pressure in rats. 2. The haemodynamic and metabolic effects of ACTH were examined in nephrectomized, 5/6 nephrectomized and orchidectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats and sham operated controls. 3. Reduction in renal mass did not increase the blood pressure rise produced by ACTH. 4. Gonadectomy did not reduce the blood pressure rise produced by ACTH, which was slightly higher in castrated animals.
1. The antiarrhythmic properties of 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy)propoxy-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril hydrochloride (opc-1085) were compared with those of propranolol and pindolol using various kinds of preparations for experimental arrhythmia in dogs. 2. Although OPC-1085 was the most potent drug to antagonize adrenaline-induced arrhythmia in animals anaesthetized with either pentobarbitone sodium or halothane, it was scarcely effective on ouabain-induced arrhythmia in pentobarbitone sodium anaesthetized animals. 3. When these compounds were administered intravenously to conscious dogs 24 h after two-stage ligation of the anterior descending artery, ectopic ventricular beats of coronary ligation-induced arrhythmia were reduced while regular sinus beats were simultaneously increased. 4. OPC-1085 was very effective on aconitine-induced arrhythmia in dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium. The effective dose was similar to that of propranolol but about fifteen times less than that of pindolol. 5. It is concluded that different potencies among these beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists against various kinds of experimental arrhythmias cannot be simply deduced from any one of the following properties; beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism, intrinsic myocardial stimulation, local anaesthetic and so-called quinidine-like effects.
Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is characterized by a localized malformation of the neocortex and underlying white matter. Balloon cells, similar to those observed in tuberous sclerosis, are present in many cases (FCD(bc)). In these patients, a hyperintense funnel-shaped subcortical lesion tapering toward the lateral ventricle was the characteristic finding on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging scans. Surgical lesionectomy results in complete seizure relief. Although the pathogenesis of FCD(bc) remains uncertain, histopathological similarities indicate that FCD(bc) may be related pathogenetically to tuberous sclerosis. Here, we studied alterations of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes in a cohort of patients with chronic, focal epilepsy and histologically documented FCD(bc) (n = 48). DNA was obtained after microdissection and laser-assisted isolation of balloon cells, dysplastic neurons, and nonlesional cells from adjacent normal brain tissue. Sequence alterations resulting in amino acid exchange of the TSC1 gene product affecting exons 5 and 17 and silent base exchanges in exons 14 and 22 were increased in patients with FCD(bc) compared with 200 control individuals (exon 5, 2.3% FCD(bc) vs 0% C; exon 17, 35% FCD(bc) vs 1.0% C; exon 14, 37.8% FCD(bc) vs 15% C; exon 22, 45% FCD(bc) vs 23.8% C). Sequence alterations could be detected in FCD(bc) and in adjacent normal cells. In 24 patients, DNA was suitable to study loss of heterozygosity at the TSC1 gene locus in microdissected FCD(bc) samples compared with control tissue. Eleven FCD(bc) cases exhibited loss of heterozygosity. In the TSC2 gene, only silent polymorphisms were detected at similar frequencies as in controls. Our findings indicate that FCD(bc) constitutes a clinicopathological entity with distinct neuroradiological, neuropathological, and molecular genetic features. These data also suggest a role of the TSC1 gene in the development of FCD(bc) and point toward a pathogenic relationship between FCD(bc) and the tuberous sclerosis complex.
Exposure to loud noise can induce temporary or permanent hearing loss, and acoustic trauma is the major cause of hearing impairment in industrial nations. However, the mechanisms underlying the death of hair cells after acoustic trauma remain unclear. In addition to its involvement in cellular stress and apoptosis, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, is involved in cell survival, transformation, embryonic morphogenesis, and differentiation. JNK is primarily activated by various environmental stresses including noise, and the phenotypic result appears be to cell death. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an active metabolite of vitamin A that regulates a wide range of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis. We evaluated the role of ATRA in preserving hearing in mice exposed to noise that can induce permanent hearing loss. Mice fed with ATRA before and during 3 consecutive days of noise exposure had a more preserved hearing threshold than mice fed sesame oil or saline. Histological and TUNEL staining of the cochlea showed significantly enhanced preservation of the organ of Corti, including outer hair cells and relatively low apoptotic nuclei, in mice-fed ATRA than in mice-fed sesame oil or saline. Phospho-JNK immunohistochemistry showed that ATRA inhibited the activation of JNK. These results suggest that ATRA has an anti-apoptotic effect on cochleae exposed to noise.
Whether single cells immunohistochemically positive for glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) induced in the female mouse liver by DEN (Hatayama et al., Carcinogenesis, 14, 537-538, 1993) are precursor initiated cells of preneoplastic foci, is of importance in chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. Nrf2 transactivates a wide variety of ARE (anti-oxidant response element)-mediated enzymes including GSTP1-1. Quantitative examination revealed that the basal expression of hepatic GSTP1-1 was 60% lower in Nrf2 gene knock-out female mice(-/-) than in wild type females, and that treatment with butyrated hydroxyanisole (BHA) increased by 10-fold GSTP1-1 expression in the liver of wild type female mice but not in knockout female mice(-/-). Despite the lack of Nrf2, GSTP1-1-positive single cells were detected in livers of DEN-treated female(-/-) 3 months after treatment. Subsequent BHA feeding to the positive cell-bearing females for one more week clearly showed that the single cells were detectable with females(-/-) but not with females(+/+,+/-) due to the strong induction of GSTP1-1 in the surrounding hepatocytes. The sensitivity to DEN hepatocarcinogenesis was not significantly different among genotypes. These results demonstrate that Nrf2 is regulatory in normal hepatocytes but not in the single cells positive for GSTP1-1 inducible in the female mouse liver by DEN. The transcriptional distinction observed for the DEN-transformants is suggestive of a preneoplastic character of precursor initiated cells.
We report about a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection who developed acute renal failure after therapy with atazanavir. Renal biopsy showed acute interstitial nephritis. After discontinuing medication with atazanavir serum creatinine level decreased spontaneously without steroids. The different etiologies of acute renal failure in patients with human immunodeficiency infection are discussed.
An unusual case of acute muscular atrophy in a patient with a severe exacerbation of asthma requiring mechanical ventilation is reported. High doses of pancuronium bromide and 6-methylprednisolone were administered. It is suggested that the conditions of mechanical ventilation increase in some way the potential of corticosteroids to cause myopathy. The possible implication of myorelaxant drugs in the development of this complication is also suggested.
It was analyzed whether the response to sotalol can predict the response to amiodarone as evaluated by programmed ventricular stimulation in 30 patients with coronary artery disease and documented recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed using 1 or 2 extrastimuli during sinus rhythm and 4 drive cycle lengths at 2 right ventricular sites. If no ventricular tachyarrhythmia was induced, a third extrastimulus was introduced during a paced cycle length of 500 ms. During the control study, VT (mean cycle length 305 +/- 63 ms) was induced in all patients, and the right ventricular effective refractory period (during S1-S1 = 500 ms) was 223 +/- 12 ms. After sotalol, sustained and nonsustained VT were inducible in 22 (73%) and 7 (23%) patients, respectively. One patient did not undergo stimulation on sotalol, because of side effects. After amiodarone, sustained and nonsustained VT were inducible in 23 (77%) and 7 (23%) patients, respectively. The mean cycle length of the induced VT was prolonged after both drugs by 17% (p < 0.001). The effective refractory period was prolonged by 15% (p < 0.001) after sotalol and by 13% (p < 0.001 compared with baseline study; p = NS between both drugs) after amiodarone. Thus, concordant results (effective or ineffective drug) between sotalol and amiodarone were found in 26 patients (87%).
(1) The effects of sotalol and amiodarone on the cycle length of induced VT and on right ventricular effective refractory period were similar; and (2) inability to suppress VT by amiodarone can be predicted from the response to sotalol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
In rats anestetized with urethane and under ganglionic blockade by hexamethonium (20 mg/kg, i.v.), the i.v. injection of serotonin (60 mug/kg) determined apnea, ECG alterations and a brief hypotensive response which is similar to that as elicited when 5-HT is given to intact rats. During the hypertension which follows that initial response, apnea is still present along with more severe ECG changes. After that, blood pressure falls into a prolonged hypotension, which is invariably accompanied by death. Neither norepinephrine, nor respiratory analeptics (CoramineR, RemeflinF) were able to prevent the fatal outcome. Only artificial respiration was found to be useful in some instances. It was concluded that the association serotonin plus lidocaine becomes lethal when given to ganglion-blocked rate, and this toxic effect can be ascribed mainly to the respiratory depressor activity of the drugs.
