Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare disease with an extremely poor prognosis. Mitotane alone or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs is a common therapeutic option for ACC. In addition to its adrenolytic function, mitotane has been known for decades to increase the metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. It was recently shown that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib is also rapidly metabolized in patients treated with mitotane, indicating that mitotane engages in clinically relevant drug interactions. Although the precise mechanism of these interactions is not well understood, cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase 3A4 (CYP3A4) is a key enzyme to inactivate both glucocorticoids and sunitinib. The nuclear receptor steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR (NR1I2)) is one of the key transcriptional regulators of CYP3A4 gene expression in the liver and intestine. A variety of xenobiotics bind to SXR and stimulate transcription of xenobiotic-response elements (XREs) located in the CYP3A4 gene promoter. In this study, we evaluated the effects of mitotane on SXR-mediated transcription in vitro by luciferase reporter analysis, SXR-steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) interactions, quantitative real-time PCR analysis of CYP3A4 expression, SXR knockdown, and CYP3A4 enzyme activity assays using human hepatocyte-derived cells. We found that mitotane activated SXR-mediated transcription of the XREs. Mitotane recruited SRC1 to the ligand-binding domain of SXR. Mitotane increased CYP3A4 mRNA levels, which was attenuated by SXR knockdown. Finally, we showed that mitotane increased CYP3A4 enzyme activity. We conclude that mitotane can induce CYP3A4 gene expression and suggest that mitotane is used cautiously due to its drug-drug interactions.
MDMA effects are mediated by monoaminergic systems, which seem to play a central role in cocaine craving and relapse.
CD1 mice trained to self-administer cocaine (1 mg/kg/infusion) underwent an extinction procedure in which the cues contingent with drug self-administration remained present. Mice achieving extinction were injected with MDMA (10 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (1 and 2 mg/kg) or saline and tested for reinstatement.
Acute MDMA, but not d-amphetamine or saline reinstated cocaine-seeking behaviour in mice in which cocaine self-administration and contingent cues were previously extinguished.
Acute MDMA can reinstate cocaine-seeking behaviour in mice.
Acute haemodynamic effects of single dose oral prazosin were studied in eight patients with mitral regurgitation. Heart rate, mean systemic arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, left ventricular filling pressure, and forward cardiac output were measured in all patients. At peak effect, prazosin reduced mean systemic arterial pressure (95 +/- 4 to 86 +/- 4 mmHg), pulmonary arterial pressure (45 +/- 6 to 23 +/- 4 mmHg), and left ventricular filling pressure (30 +/- 4 to 21 +/- 3 mmHg). Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance also fell (316 +/- 49 to 208 +/- 43 dynes s cm-5 and 2132 +/- 148 to 1491 +/- 94 dynes s cm-5, respectively). Forward cardiac index increased from 1.89 +/- 0.12 to 2.43 +/- 0.13 l/min per m2 and stroke volume from 43 +/- 5 to 57 +/- 6 ml/beat after prazosin. The onset of these changes occurred between 15 and 30 minutes, peaked between 45 and 60 minutes, and persisted for six hours. These data indicate that in patients with mitral regurgitation oral prazosin promptly improves cardiac performance (judged by increased forward cardiac output and reduced left ventricular filling pressure) as systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance are reduced.
Six children are described in whom deafness followed treatment of full thickness burns with topical antibiotic spray containing neomycin. 3 children developed hypocalcaemic tetany, and were shown to have a metabolic disorder involving hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hypokalaemia. The dangers of treating burns with topical ototoxic and nephrotoxic antibiotics are emphasised.
Methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or "ecstasy") are synthetic amphetamine analogs that have become increasingly popular, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Many deleterious physiologic effects arising from the use of these agents have been well documented in the medical literature. Urinary retention, however, has rarely been reported as an effect of MDMA or methamphetamine use and is thought to occur as a result of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation of the bladder neck. We report a case of acute, transient urinary retention due to combined MDMA and methamphetamine use with laboratory confirmation.
A 33-year-old Latin-American woman with a history of psychosis and mood disorder, but no cardiac history or risk factors, presented with heart failure after 6 weeks of clozapine and olanzapine therapy. Her presentation was ambiguous and further complicated by a highly suggestible nature, which delayed the proper diagnosis and treatment. After discontinuing the antipsychotic agents and completing an otherwise negative comprehensive work-up, her heart function significantly improved (left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 38% to 53%). A literature search showed that cardiomyopathy secondary to antipsychotics has been reported but remains poorly understood. This is the second documented case report of clozapine-induced cardiomyopathy in a Latin-American woman.
The effect of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), 5 mg sublingually, on the diameters of coronary artery stenoses (n = 27) was examined in 20 patients. Another 18 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries received the same amount of ISDN and were used as controls. Prestenotic and stenotic diameters were measured with a vernier calliper having an accuracy of 0.05 mm. The degree of stenosis was expressed as percentage of cross-sectional area reduction. ISDN caused uniform dilatation of every normal epicardial artery; mean increase in diameter was 21 per cent (range: 17 to 26%). In 18 stenoses (28 to 95% obstruction) there was very little change after ISDN. The mean prestenotic diameter increased from 2.82 +/- 0.48 mm to 3.05 +/- 0.43 mm and the mean stenotic diameter from 1.45 +/- 0.49 mm to 1.59 +/- 0.51 mm. However, in the nine other stenoses (35 to 89% obstruction) the mean degree of obstruction decreased significantly from 68 +/- 15.6 per cent to 47 +/- 15.6 per cent after ISDN. This improvement was a result of a significant increase of the mean stenotic diameter from 1.71 +/- 0.47 mm to 2.41 +/- 0.55 mm, whereas the prestenotic diameter showed only an insignificant increase from 3.17 +/- 0.63 mm to 3.31 +/- 0.58 mm after ISDN. In four patients with two obstructions in different coronary branches ISDN dilated one without significantly affecting the other lesion. From the data we conclude that ISDN can dilate some coronary artery stenoses but that this response may vary from one site to another even in the same patient.
Much attention has been paid to the long-term toxic and carcinogenic effects of nicotine-containing substances, particularly tobacco. Although rare, acute ingestions of large amounts of nicotine can produce rapid and dramatic toxicity. We present a case of an ingestion of a nicotine sulfate solution by a 15-year-old boy resulting in hypoxia and irreversible encephalopathy. The diagnosis of acute nicotine toxicity potentially could be delayed due to the fact that nicotine and cotinine are so commonly found on drug screens that they are considered "normal variants."
Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by marked urinary excretion of albumin and other intermediated-size plasma proteins such as transferrin. The aim of this study was to determine the changes of serum iron and transferrin and the relationship between the serum and urinary transferrin.
The indexes related to iron metabolism, including serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation and hematological parameters (Hb, MCV, MCH), and urinary transferrin were measured in 37 children with NS before treatment and at the remission stage. Thirty-five age-matched healthy children served as controls.
Serum iron levels (18.8 +/- 3.8 micromol/L) in NS patients before treatment were significantly lower than in the healthy controls (22.2 +/-3.8 micromol/L) and those measured at the remission stage (21.0 +/- 3.5 micromol/L) (P < 0.01). Serum transferrin levels in NS patients before therapy (1.9 +/- 0.3 g/L) also decreased compared with those in the healthy controls (3.1 +/- 0.5 g/L) and those measured at the remission stage (2.9 +/- 0.6 g/L) (P < 0.01). In contrast, serum total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation were noticeably higher in NS patients before treatment than those in the healthy controls (total iron-binding capacity 56.4 +/- 9.2 micromol/L vs 50.7 +/- 6.8 micromol, P < 0.01; transferrin saturation 55.7 +/- 9.2 % vs 46.4 +/- 8.2%, P < 0.01) and were also higher than those measured at the remission stage (51.9 +/-7.7 micromol/L and 47.4 +/- 13.3%) (P < 0.01). Serum transferrin positively correlated to serum albumin (r = 0.609, P < 0.01) and negatively correlated to urinary transferrin (r = -0.550, P < 0.01) in NS patients before treatment.
Serum iron and transferrin levels markedly decreased in NS patients, which may be partially related to the urinary loss of transferrin.
Alcohol consumption has been implicated to cause severe hepatic steatosis which is mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity and CYP(450) 2E1 expression. In this context, the effect of ethanol was studied for its influence on lipogenesis in HepG2 cell which is deficient of ADH and does not express CYP(450) 2E1. The results showed that ethanol at 100mM concentration caused 40% cytotoxicity at 72h as determined by MTT assay. The incorporation of labeled [2-(14)C] acetate into triacylglycerol and phospholipid was increased by 40% and 26% respectively upon 24h incubation, whereas incorporation of labeled [2-(14)C] acetate into cholesterol was not significantly increased. Further, ethanol inhibited HMG-CoA reductase which is a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis. It was observed that, HMG-CoA reductase inhibition was brought about by ethanol as a consequence of decreased cell viability, since incubation of HepG2 cells with mevalonate could not increase the cholesterol content and increase the cell viability. Addition of ethanol significantly increased TNF-alpha secretion and depleted mitochondrial coenzyme-Q(10) which is detrimental for cell viability. But vitamin E (10mM) could partially restore coenzyme-Q(10) and glutathione content with decreased TNF-alpha secretion in ethanol treated cells. Further, lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase enzyme activities remained unaffected. Ethanol decreased glutathione content while, GSH/GSSG ratio was significantly higher compared to other groups showing cellular pro-oxidant and antioxidant balance remained intact. Alanine amino transferase activity was increased by 4.85 folds in cells treated with ethanol confirming hepatocyte damage. Hence, it is inferred that ethanol induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells due to coenzyme-Q(10) depletion and increased TNF-alpha secretion.
Deficiency of the ninth component of complement (C9D) is one of the most common genetic abnormalities in Japan, with an incidence of one homozygote in 1000. Although C9D individuals are usually healthy, it has been shown that they have an significantly increased risk of developing meningococcal meningitis. In the present study we report the molecular bases for C9D in 10 unrelated Japanese subjects. As a screening step for mutations, exons 2 to 11 of the C9 gene were analyzed using exon-specific PCR/single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, which demonstrated aberrantly migrating DNA bands in exon 4 in all the C9D subjects. Subsequent direct sequencing of exon 4 of the C9D subjects revealed that eight of the 10 C9D subjects were homozygous for a C to T transition at nucleotide 343, the first nucleotide of the codon CGA for Arg95, leading to a TGA stop codon (R95X). R95X is a novel mutation different from those recently identified in a Swiss family with C9D. Cases 6 and 7 were heterozygous for the R95X mutation. Family study in case 10 confirmed the genetic nature of the defect. In case 6, the second mutation for C9D of the C9 gene was identified to be the substitution of Cys to Tyr at amino acid residue 507 (C507Y), while the genetic defect(s) in the other allele in case 7 remains unknown. Our results indicate that a novel mutation, R95X, is present in most cases of C9D in Japan.
Prior research has shown that cocaine dependence is associated with dysfunction of brain systems involved in emotions and motivational states.
To examine whether difficulties in emotion regulation are associated with early cocaine abstinence using the recently validated Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).
Recently abstinent treatment-seeking cocaine patients (n=60) completed the DERS during their first week of inpatient treatment and at discharge (3-4 weeks later), and scores were compared with community controls (n=50).
Compared with controls, cocaine-dependent individuals reported difficulties relating to understanding emotions, managing emotions and impulse control in the first week of abstinence. With continued abstinence, cocaine-dependent individuals showed continued difficulties only in impulse control.
Cocaine-dependent individuals report emotion regulation difficulties, particularly during early abstinence. Additionally, protracted distress-related impulse control problems suggest potential relapse vulnerability.
Combined bezafibrate (BEZ) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) exert unexpected antileukaemic activities against acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and these activities are associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the tumor cells. Although the generation of ROS by these drugs is supported by preceding studies including our own, the interrelationship between the cellular effects of the drugs and ROS generation is not well understood. Here we report the use of NMR metabolomic profiling to further study the effect of BEZ and MPA on three AML cell lines and to shed light on the underlying mechanism of action. For this we focused on drug effects induced during the initial 24 hours of treatment prior to the onset of overt cellular responses and examined these in the context of basal differences in metabolic profiles between the cell lines. Despite their ultimately profound cellular effects, the early changes in metabolic profiles engendered by these drugs were less pronounced than the constitutive metabolic differences between cell types. Nonetheless, drug treatments engendered common metabolic changes, most markedly in the response to the combination of BEZ and MPA. These responses included changes to TCA cycle intermediates consistent with recently identified chemical actions of ROS. Notable amongst these was the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate which was recapitulated by the treatment of cell extracts with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. These findings indicate that the actions of combined BEZ and MPA against AML cells are indeed mediated downstream of the generation of ROS rather than some hitherto unsuspected mechanism. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that metabolite profiles represent highly sensitive markers for genomic differences between cells and their responses to external stimuli. This opens new perspectives to use metabolic profiling as a tool to study the rational redeployment of drugs in new disease settings.
Children affected by advanced neuroblastoma have a discouraging prognosis, but intensive induction chemotherapy may increase the complete response rate. The combination of ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (ICE) was used for the first time as front-line regimen in patients with stage 4 neuroblastoma over the age of 1 y. Similarly, second-line treatment for children with relapsed neuroblastoma, particularly after high-dose chemotherapy, has been unsatisfactory. The combination of topotecan and cyclophosphamide was studied in resistant or relapsed solid tumors. Furthermore, there is a need for effective palliative treatment in patients failing therapy. Temozolomide, a new dacarbazine analog with optimal oral bioavailability, is being used in an ongoing phase II study as an alternative to oral etoposide. Seventeen patients with stage 4 neuroblastoma have entered the ICE study; 15/16 (94%) major responses after induction were observed and 6/16 (37%) evaluable patients are disease free after a median of 51 mo. Twenty-one patients with relapsed/refractory disease (of whom 13 neuroblastomas) entered the topotecan/cyclophosphamide study: 7/21 (33%) patients responded. Forty-one patients entered the temozolomide study (of whom 16 had neuroblastomas): stable disease and symptom relief were obtained in 15/30 (50%) evaluable patients. Intensive induction with ICE resulted in a faster response with high response rate; a larger study with longer follow-up is needed to confirm a survival advantage. Second-line treatment was effective in obtaining remissions, some of them long lasting. Third-line treatment did not elicit measurable responses in neuroblastoma, but achieved prolonged freedom from disease progression and excellent palliation in several patients.
A fatal disease epidemic affected the Bentiu area in southern Sudan and led to a mass migration of the Nuer tribe searching for treatment. The initially available information revealed a high mortality rate due to a possible occurrence of tuberculosis, malaria, enteric fever or visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Serological screening of 53 of the most severely affected patients in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or an improved direct agglutination test (DAT) revealed positivity for VL. In 39 of those patients, diagnosis was confirmed by identification of Leishmania donovani amastigotes in lymph node or bone-marrow aspirates. In a total of 2714 patients observed, 1195 (44.0%) had clinical symptoms suggesting VL: DAT positive titers (1:3200-greater than or equal to 1:12800) were obtained in 654 (24.1%), of whom 325 were confirmed parasitologically. Forty-two VL cases died before or during treatment, giving a mortality rate of 6.4%. Among the intercurrent infections diagnosed in the VL population (654), respiratory involvements (31.7%) and malaria (10.7%) were most prevalent. With the exception of four (0.6%), all other VL patients (509) responded readily to sodium stibogluconate. The factors initiating the outbreak are discussed. Malnutrition and nomadic movements to potential VL endemic areas appeared to be the most important. HIV infection as a possible predisposition seemed remote considering the clinical and epidemiological similarity to VL occurring in East Africa, adequate humoral response in DAT, and immediate positive response to specific anti-Leishmania chemotherapy.
Glucocorticoids are usually given for management of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The overall rate of favorable response for moderately severe and active GO is 77% in patients treated with methylprednisolone iv pulse therapy. When radioiodine therapy is indicated for hyperthyroidism in Graves' patients with high risk factors, the use of glucocorticoid with small doses and short periods is recommended to prevent the development or progression of GO. Cushingoid features, glucose intolerance, gastritis, hypertension, hepatitis, and depression are major adverse effects of glucocorticoids. Fatal liver failure after high dose of pulse therapy (9-12g) was observed in 0.8%. Limiting the cumulative dose to 4.5-6g, assessment of liver virus markers and monitoring liver function before, during and after i.v. treatment are warranted.
Eighteen infants were entered into a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of dexamethasone therapy for chronic lung disease. Initial ventilation requirements were similar in the two groups, although all infants were in headbox oxygen on entry to the trial. The dexamethasone-treated infants showed a significantly more rapid improvement during the 1st week of treatment, although the overall duration of oxygen therapy was similar in both groups. Cranial ultrasound examination revealed new periventricular abnormalities in three out of the five dexamethasone-treated infants who had previously normal scans, compared with none of four similar placebo-treated infants. A large trial, focussing on potential complications, is now needed.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of paroxetine in patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS).
In a 12-week open-label, noncomparative, prospective study, 71 subjects with primary BMS were assigned to receive an initial dosage of paroxetine (10 or 20 mg/day). The dosage was increased to a maximum of 30 mg/day. Of these patients, 52 were available to examine the efficacy of treatment in this study.
The cumulative proportion of responders was 80.8% (42/52). Of those responding, complete remission of pain was observed in 70.4% (19/27) of patients by week 12. The effects of paroxetine were dose-dependent. The incidence of adverse reactions for the initial daily dosage of 10 mg (41%) was significantly lower than that for 20 mg (76%) (chi(2) test). No serious safety issues were observed.
About 80% of BMS patients experienced pain reduction with 12 weeks of paroxetine treatment with only minor transient side effects. These results suggest that paroxetine may be useful in the treatment of patients with BMS.
We report a case of sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma with a chromophobe component showing significant elevation of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) in the peripheral blood. A 35-year-old man was hospitalized because of a large tumor of the left kidney and elevated serum levels of beta-HCG. Extended nephrectomy was performed, after which the serum beta-HCG level decreased. However, 3 months later, masses were discovered in the left renal bed and in the lung in association with elevated serum levels of beta-HCG. The patient was rehospitalized and received combination therapy with interferon-alpha and doxorubicin-based multiple chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine). The recurrent mass responded extremely well to treatment, and beta-HCG normalized. However, the patient died 14 months after nephrectomy because of eventual resistance to chemotherapy. Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma containing beta-HCG positive cells were pathologically diagnosed with immunohistochemical staining in the left kidney. Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma is a variant of renal adenocarcinoma which has a poor prognosis. This patient had an extremely rare sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma associated with serum levels of beta-HCG which were elevated and strongly correlated with morphologic cancer activity. beta-HCG might be a useful serum marker for detecting and monitoring this renal cell carcinoma.
We describe the case of a 36 year old man, habitual consumer of cocaine, who after the inhaled cocaine consumption develops acute renal failure secondary to massive left and segmental right renal infarction. Although the most frequent complications associated to cocaine consumption are of cardiovascular and neurological nature, the kidney can be frequently affected.
In patients with non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, spontaneous rebleeding does not occur. The lack of reported recurrences may lead to less cautious administration of antithrombotic therapy.
Case report.
A 57-year-old woman with a perimesencephalic pattern of hemorrhage and negative CT angiography was treated with carbasalate calcium and intravenous heparin because of an acute coronary syndrome. Three days after installment of this antithrombotic therapy she experienced a recurrent perimesencephalic hemorrhage leading to hydrocephalus and a decrease in consciousness. She died the same day as a result of ventricular fibrillation.
In the early phase after perimesencephalic hemorrhage, anticoagulant therapy may lead to rebleeding. The risks and benefits of antithrombotic therapy should be carefully weighed in patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of hemorrhage and negative CT angiography.
The effects of the two central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs ethanol and sodium valproate were compared using two pairs of mouse lines that had been selected from a heterogeneous stock for differential sensitivity to ethanol. The LS/SS lines differ in sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation, and the WSP/WSR lines differ in the severity of their withdrawal convulsions after chronic ethanol treatment. We used these lines to test the hypothesis that ethanol and valproate act by the same mechanism. CNS depressant action was assessed by determining the brain drug concentration at which the mice lost their ability to balance on a stationary wooden dowel. LS mice were about twice as sensitive as SS mice to valproate-induced ataxia, in agreement with their reported relative sensitivity to ethanol. The WSR and WSP mice did not differ significantly in sensitivity to ethanol or valproate in this test. The intrinsic order and sensitivity to disordering of synaptosomal plasma membranes prepared from the four lines were measured using fluorescence polarization with the probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene and EPR spectroscopy with 5-doxylstearic acid. No differences in the intrinsic membrane order of the four lines were detected with either technique. The sensitivities of the membranes from the four lines to ethanol- or valproate-induced disordering were not significantly different when measured by fluorescence polarization, but EPR spectroscopy revealed line differences in disordering sensitivity that correlated with the relative sensitivity of the four lines to the CNS depressant action of these drugs. These studies show that genetic factors modulate sensitivity to ethanol and valproate in a similar manner both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that these drugs act by the same membrane-disordering mechanism.
Acute myocardial infarction occurred in a 25-year-old woman. Coronary angiography performed one month after the acute illness was normal. An ergonovine test was negative. The patient's acute myocardial infarction most probably was induced by the use of oral contraceptives in combination with heavy smoking. Oral contraceptives, with their known influence on the blood coagulation system, must be considered a risk factor in precipitating coronary artery disease.
We report two cases of antidepressant induced cholestasis.
We describe the first reported case of acute cholestasis due to citalopram (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) occurring in a patient who also experienced obstetric cholestasis in association with each of three pregnancies; in a second patient cholestasis developed due to dothiepin (tricyclic antidepressant), and six years later due to paroxetine. In both cases liver biopsies showed features of a "pure" cholestasis with total resolution within 1-6 months after withdrawal of the causative drug. Immunostaining for the canalicular transporter, multidrug resistant protein 2 (MRP2), responsible for biliary secretion of several organic anions including bilirubin glucuronides, showed sustained expression in both biopsies as well as relocalisation with appearance of strong staining of the basolateral membrane of the hepatocyte. This finding has also not been reported previously.
We postulate that intracellular redistribution of MRP2 may reflect an adaptive compensatory mechanism which helps in the elimination of the drug or its cholestatic metabolites from the hepatocyte back to the sinusoidal space and subsequent excretion in urine. Changes seen in these two patients differ from findings previously reported in rats where downregulation of mrp2 occurs in response to experimentally induced cholestasis. We speculate that the rat is more advanced than humans in its ability to downregulate canalicular transporter expression as protection against progressive intrahepatic cholestasis.
Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFkappaB) is a eukaryotic transcription factor that is constitutively active in human cancers and can be inhibited by the naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone, parthenolide (P).
The in vitro effects of P were assessed using the androgen independent cell line, CWR22Rv1, and human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). The in vivo activity of P as a single agent and its ability to augment the efficacy of docetaxel and the anti-androgen, bicalutamide, were determined using the CWR22Rv1 xenograft model.
Parthenolide at low micromolar concentration inhibited proliferation of CWR22Rv1 and HUVEC cells, promoted apoptosis and abrogated NFkappaB-DNA binding. Parthenolide downregulated anti-apoptotic genes under NFkappaB control, TRAF 1 and 2, and promoted sustained activation of c-jun-NH2 kinase (JNK). Parthenolide also augmented the in vivo efficacy of docetaxel and restored sensitivity to anti-androgen therapy.
These studies demonstrate parthenolide's anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity, and its potential to augment the efficacy of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy.
A study was conducted on hepatic fat content to investigate the frequency and clinical course of hepatic steatosis induced by tamoxifen.
Sixty-seven patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen were included. The patients underwent postoperative annual abdominal CT, both with and without contrast enhancement, for 5 years. We retrospectively reviewed unenhanced CT images and obtained hepatic and splenic CT attenuation values to calculate the liver-spleen ratio. Hepatic steatosis was defined as a liver-spleen ratio of less than 0:9, and its degree was classified as mild (liver-spleen ratio, 0:5-0:9), moderate (0-0:5), or severe (<0). The pattern of steatosis was classified as generalized, lobar, segmental, or focal.
In the study population, hepatic CT values decreased during therapy (p < 0.0001, t test) and increased after therapy (p < 0.0001, paired t test). Twenty-nine patients (43.2%) developed hepatic steatosis within the first 2 years; its degree was mild in 16, moderate in nine, and severe in four. Seventeen patients showed a generalized pattern of steatosis, and the other 12 showed a lobar pattern. Twenty-three of these patients showed an increase in the liver-spleen ratio after therapy to within the normal range, with a mean recovery time of 1.2 years after therapy ended. None progressed to steatohepatitis or cirrhosis.
Tamoxifen had a statistically significant influence on hepatic fat content and was associated with frequent development of hepatic steatosis. Radiologists should be aware of this phenomenon and the possible occurrence of hepatic dysfunction and should differentiate steatosis from metastasis in postoperative patients with breast cancer.
The causes of prostate cancer are poorly understood, but genetic factors may be more important than for many other malignancies, and dietary phytoestrogens may be protective. Because phytoestrogens bind tightly to the estrogen receptor-beta, we conducted an epidemiologic investigation of synergistic effects between phytoestrogen intake and estrogen receptor-beta gene polymorphisms.
We performed a population-based case-control study in Sweden. All participants reported their phytoestrogen intake and donated a blood sample. We identified four haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) and genotyped these htSNPs in 1314 prostate cancer patients and 782 controls. Odds ratios were estimated by multivariate logistic regression. Interactions between phytoestrogen intake and estrogen receptor-beta SNPs on prostate cancer risk were evaluated considering both multiplicative and additive effect scales.
We found a significant multiplicative interaction (P = 0.04) between dietary intake of phytoestrogens and a promoter SNP in the estrogen receptor-beta gene (rs 2987983-13950), but not with any of the three other htSNPs (P = 0.11, 0.69, 0.85). Among carriers of the variant promoter alleles, we found strong inverse associations with increasing intake of total phytoestrogens (odds ratio for highest vs. lowest quartile = 0.43; P for trend <0.001), isoflavonoids (odds ratio = 0.63; P for trend = 0.05), and coumestrol (odds ratio = 0.57; P for trend = 0.003). We found no association between phytoestrogens and prostate cancer among carriers homozygous for the wild-type allele (TT).
Our study provides strong evidence that high intake of phytoestrogens substantially reduce prostate cancer risk among men with specific polymorphic variation in the promoter region of the estrogen receptor-beta gene.
