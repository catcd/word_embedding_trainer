From data collected in the literature, the effects of octreotide therapy in 37 patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-secreting adenomas who received short-term (1 to 2 weeks, n = 23) and long-term treatment (3 to 36 months) are reviewed. In 20 of 21 patients studied, short-term administration of octreotide (50 or 100 micrograms subcutaneously [SC] produced a 25% to 100% (mean +/- SD, 55.3% +/- 29%) decrease in TSH levels, with the nadir being obtained between the third and sixth hour following injection. After 1 to 2 weeks therapy with 50 to 100 micrograms twice or three times a day, 21 of 23 patients studied demonstrated a 66% (+/- 30%) decrease in TSH levels and 14 of 16 showed a 64% (+/- 27%) decrease in alpha-subunit levels. In approximately two thirds of the patients, the response was better than after short-term administration. The effect of octreotide on clinical and biological thyroid status was significant in all patients studied. After 1 week or 1 month of treatment, thyroid hormone levels were reduced in all patients and were normalized in 78%. Response to therapy was similar whether TSH secretion was pure or mixed (growth hormone [GH]-TSH adenomas). Fourteen patients received long-term treatment (3 to 36 months; mean, 12 +/- 10) with daily doses ranging from 200 to 1,500 micrograms. The response was better than or similar to that with short-term treatment. An escape occurred in TSH levels in two patients and in thyroid hormone levels in three patients, leading to an adjustment of dose or frequency of injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
We attempted to clarify the effects of cyclohexenonic long-chain fatty alcohol (N-hexacosanol) on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. After induction of experimental diabetes with streptozotocin, rats were maintained for 8 weeks with or without treatment by N-hexacosanol (8 mg/kg i.p. every day). Urinary albumin excretion, blood chemistry, immunoblot analysis, and real-time polymerase chain reactions (real-time PCR) of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and neuronal NOS (nNOS) were investigated. Although N-hexacosanol had no effects on serum glucose or insulin level, it normalized serum creatinine and urinary albumin excretion. N-hexacosanol was found to improve the diabetes-induced alterations in the eNOS, iNOS, and nNOS protein and their mRNA levels. Histologically, N-hexacosanol inhibited the progression to glomerular sclerosis. Our data suggest that N-hexacosanol improves diabetes-induced NOS alterations in the kidney, resulting in the amelioration of diabetic nephropathy.
Twenty-five acromegalic patients were studied during 6 years of treatment with octreotide, with a particular focus on the following parameters: (1) Administration schedule: in 10 patients, continuous subcutaneous (SC) octreotide infusion was compared with injections of octreotide at three dose levels (100, 250, and 1,500 micrograms/24 h) and was found to induce a greater and less-fluctuating 24-hour growth hormone (GH) suppression. (2) Carbohydrate tolerance: average 24-hour blood glucose levels were unaffected by octreotide, regardless of administration schedule. Oral carbohydrate tolerance and intravenous (IV) glucose tolerance were unaffected by continuous octreotide infusion. However, octreotide injection given shortly before the tests reduced carbohydrate tolerance. (3) Thyroid function: octreotide and somatostatin acutely reduce the response of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). After a few days of treatment, it was demonstrated that octreotide slightly inhibits iodothyronine deiodination and induces a transient reduction in serum triiodothyronine (T3), rapidly compensated for by a persistent slight elevation of serum TSH. (4) Fat absorption was estimated as 24-hour fecal fat content and found to be in the same high-normal range before and after octreotide treatment. Vitamin K and D absorption were unaffected by octreotide. The incidence of gallstone formation was not greater than in the general Danish population, possibly due to the schedule used for octreotide injections. (5) Foot volume was regularly estimated and found to decrease with time, on average by 12% during the first 18 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The effectiveness of the alkycycline 4-demethoxy-3'-deamino-3'-aziridinyl-4'-methylsulphonyl-daunorubicin (PNU-159548, ladirubicin), a new drug with high antitumour activity against a broad range of neoplasms, was evaluated by using a panel of 32 human osteosarcoma cell lines, including cell lines resistant to doxorubicin, methotrexate, or cisplatin. PNU-159548 resulted to be highly active in all cell lines. No cross-resistance was found with conventional drugs, being PNU-159548 active also in cells resistant to doxorubicin and with a multidrug resistance phenotype (associated with MDR1 gene/P-glycoprotein overexpression), as well as in cells resistant to methotrexate or to cisplatin. Analysis of drug-drug interactions showed that PNU-159548 could be successfully used in combination with all the most important drugs currently used in OS chemotherapy. In fact, the simultaneous administration of PNU-159548 and doxorubicin, methotrexate, or cisplatin produced mostly additive or synergistic effects. Sequential exposure to PNU-159548 followed immediately by doxorubicin, methotrexate, or cisplatin was the most effective sequence of administration, invariably resulting in additive or synergistic effects in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant osteosarcoma cell lines. In conclusion, the high in vitro effectiveness, the absence of cross-resistance with doxorubicin, methotrexate, or cisplatin and the possibility to be successfully used in combination with these drugs indicate PNU-159548 as a promising candidate to be considered for planning new therapeutic regimens for osteosarcoma patients, who show a decreased response to conventional chemotherapy.
In addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, cholesteryl hemisuccinate, tris salt (CS) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepatotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS, gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid, tris salt (CSE) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, chloroform- and galactosamine-induced toxicity. The results of these studies demonstrated that CS-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical. A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4, CHCl3, acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal (and presumably cardiotoxic) effect of adriamycin administration. Maximal CS-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult. These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death. The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity). However, based on the data presented, we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation. Our findings do suggest that CS-mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule (non-hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS), whose mechanism has yet to be defined.
Acute renal failure (ARF) induced by dextran or mannitol is a lethal adverse effect, and hemodialysis or plasma exchange is recommended to avoid fatal ARF. This report describes 2 cases of ARF; one caused by dextran and the other by mannitol. Both showed decreases in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratios after the administration of these reagents. They immediately recovered to the level of creatinine on admission after the administration of these reagents was stopped, without hemodialysis or plasma exchange. Decreases in the BUN/creatinine ratio might be a useful index for the diagnosis of ARF is caused by these reagents.
Torsade de pointes, a polymorphous ventricular tachycardia, is a well-known but rarely occurring cardiac adverse drug reaction under amiodarone, a class-III antiarrhythmic agent. We report the case of a 60-year-old male patient who developed a life-threatening torsade after three weeks of amiodarone therapy. Considering some potential risk factors, amiodarone is an effective and safe antiarrhythmic agent for ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia. In most patients, Amiodarone can be used safely even in those who had developed a torsade de pointes with other antiarrhythmic agents.
A case of pituitary apoplexy occurring after Gd-DTPA-administration for contrast enhanced MRI in a patient with an hGH-producing macro-adenoma is presented. Within days the initially increased hGH level fell to the normal range, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed a normal suppression of hGH and complete anterior pituitary insufficiency developed. At this time repeated MRI suggested a haemorrhagic infarction of the macro-adenoma. Fourteen months later re-examination confirmed spontaneous cure of the acromegaly, improvement of adenopituitary function and shrinkage of the sellar content. The causal linkage between the pituitary adenoma apoplexy and Gd-DTPA-administration is unclear. It might be due to contrast induced blood pressure and endothelial permeability changes, possibly promoted by pre-existing diabetes mellitus associated vasculopathy.
Treatment of hypertension with enalapril in a preterm infant is described. Enalapril is a new converting enzyme blocker with a longer plasma half-life and less side effects than captopril. Oral administration of enalapril 0.1 mg/kg caused severe hypotension and renal failure in a preterm infant. We recommend an oral starting dose of 0.01 mg/kg in preterm infants and extremely close monitoring of infants receiving the first dose of enalapril.
The CFTR mutations in cystic fibrosis (CF) lead to ion transport anomalities which predispose to chronic infection and inflammation of CF airways as the major determinants for morbidity and mortality in CF. Discordant clinical phenotypes of siblings with identical CFTR mutations and the large variability of clinical manifestations of patients who are homozygous for the most common mutation F508del suggest that both environment and genes other than CFTR contribute substantially to CF disease. The prime candidates for genetic modifiers in CF are elements of host defence such as the TNFalpha receptor and of ion transport such as the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel ENaC, both of which are encoded side by side on 12p13 (TNFRSF1A, SCNN1A) and 16p12 (SCNN1B, SCNN1G). Thirty-seven families with F508del-CFTR homozygous siblings exhibiting extreme clinical phenotypes that had been selected from the 467 pairs of the European CF Twin and Sibling Study were genotyped at 12p13 and 16p12 markers. The ENaC was identified as a modulator of CF by transmission disequilibrium at SCNN1G and association with CF phenotype intrapair discordance at SCNN1B. Family-based and case-control analyses and sequencing of SCNN1A and TNFRSF1A uncovered an association of the TNFRSF1A intron 1 haplotype with disease severity. Carriers of risk haplotypes were underrepresented suggesting a strong impact of both loci on survival. The finding that TNFRSF1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G are clinically relevant modulators of CF disease supports current concepts that the depletion of airway surface liquid and inadequate host inflammatory responses trigger pulmonary disease in CF.
The administration of estrogens to humans has been associated with the development of benign and possibly malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. This study was designed to investigate the mechanism of this association. We present a rat model that demonstrates that stilbestrol (DES) and ethinyl estradiol promote the development of hepatic neoplasms in rats previously initiated with diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Eighty male and 12 female Fischer-344 rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of either DEN (200 mg. per kg. of body weight) or saline. Beginning 4 weeks after injection, the rats were given an estrogen or corn oil twice weekly for up to 50 weeks. Treatments were stopped at the time of sacrifice or 11 to 29 weeks prior to sacrifice. Estrogen treatments included high dose DES (5 mg. per dose), low dose DES (0.5 mg. per dose), and ethinyl estradiol (0.2 mg. per dose). Male and female rats given both DEN and high dose DES developed grossly visible hepatic hyperplastic nodules (mean, 9.1 per liver) after 20 weeks of DES. Nodules also developed if the onset of DES treatment was delayed until 28 weeks after initiation. Rats given DEN alone or DES alone did not develop nodules after 20 weeks. Microscopic hyperplastic foci also developed in rats given DEN plus DES, DES alone, and DEN alone. The foci in rats given DES alone were largely reversible on cessation of estrogen therapy. Mitotic activity in foci and nodules was prominent during estrogen therapy but declined markedly after cessation of therapy. Similar promoting activity of ethinyl estradiol was observed. Low dose DES was not effective in promoting tumor formation. The data indicate that estrogens promote hepatic neoplasia, perhaps by increasing hepatocyte mitotic activity and thereby facilitating the evolution of previously initiated cells into neoplastic clones. Comparison with human disease should be made with caution, especially because the estrogenic dose administered was approximately 200-fold the usual contraceptive dose in humans. However, the analogy between this model and the development of human oral contraceptive-associated hepatic tumors is evident. It is possible that some women have latent "initiated" cells that divide faster than the surrounding hepatocytes in response to estrogens.
A frequent coexistence of diabetes and porphyria disease has been reported. Under normal conditions, porphyrin biosynthesis is well regulated to only form the amount of heme required for the synthesis of the various hemoproteins. The activity of some heme enzymes and rhodanese in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic mice and in allylisopropylacetamide (AIA) induced experimental acute porphyria mice has been examined. The role of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T), reported to prevent protein glycation in vitro, has also been investigated. AIA induced hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase (ALA-S) activity in control animals but was ineffective in the diabetic group. alpha-Tocopherol did not modify ALA-S activity in either group. delta-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D) and deaminase activities were significantly diminished both in liver and blood of diabetic animals. alpha-Tocopherol prevented inhibition of ALA-D, deaminase and blood rhodanese activities in diabetic animals but alpha-tocopherol by itself did not affect the basal levels of the enzymes studied. The potential use of alpha-tocopherol to prevent late complications of diabetes, including the onset of a porphyria like syndrome is considered.
In systemic sclerosis, abnormalities of myocardial perfusion are common and may be caused by a disturbance of the coronary microcirculation. We evaluated the long-term effect of captopril (75 to 150 mg per day) on thallium 201 myocardial perfusion in 12 normotensive patients with systemic sclerosis. Captopril significantly decreased the mean (+/- SD) number of segments with thallium 201 myocardial perfusion defects (6.5 +/- 1.9 at baseline and 4.4 +/- 2.7 after 1 year of treatment with captopril; p less than 0.02) and increased the mean global thallium score (9.6 +/- 1.7 at baseline and 11.4 +/- 2.1 after captopril; p less than 0.05). In a control group of eight normotensive patients with systemic sclerosis who did not receive captopril, no significant modification in thallium results occurred. Side effects with captopril included hypotension (six patients), taste disturbances (one patient), and skin rash (one patient). These side effects subsided when the dosage was reduced. These findings demonstrate that captopril improves thallium 201 myocardial perfusion in patients with systemic sclerosis and may therefore have a beneficial effect on scleroderma myocardial disease.
Pregnant rats exhibited regenerative anemia development 3 months upon a single intravenous injection of carboplatin in a maximum tolerated dose; the effect increased by the end of pregnancy. The character of changes in parameters of the peripheral and central erythron parts (increased level of erythrocyte hemolysis, decrease in the amount of erythrocytes, increase in the number of reticulocytes, development of erythropoietic hyperplasia in bone marrow and spleen) was indicative of the hemolytic type of anemia.
Abrupt or gradual discontinuation of tricyclic antidepressants may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. The most common of these are general somatic or gastrointestinal distress, anxiety and agitation, sleep disturbance, akathisia, parkinsonism, paradoxical behavioral activation and mania. There are very few reports of withdrawal reactions following discontinuation of clomipramine since it has not been in use in the US until recently. 2 patients with withdrawal symptoms following discontinuation of clomipramine are presented. A 45-year-old man had general somatic symptoms, including headache, myalgia, weakness, fatigue (flu-like syndrome) and nervousness and insomnia after clomipramine, 75 mg/d, had been discontinued abruptly. All symptoms disappeared without treatment after 3 days. A 47-year-old woman presented mainly with severe insomnia, anxiety, agitation, jitteriness and tension after discontinuing a low dose of 25 mg/d of clomipramine. Symptoms disappeared after she started self-treatment with 50 mg/d of the drug. It is important to differentiate withdrawal symptoms from relapse of the primary psychiatric disorder.
Mice carrying the gene Mx were resistant to the lethal action of a hepatotropic line of avian influenza A virus. In resistant animals, foci of liver necrosis were self-limiting, and maximal virus titers reached were much below those in susceptible animals. Resistance could not be abrogated by immunosuppressive treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, or procarbazine, although such treatment prevented cellular infiltration at sites of virus replication and appeared to delay virus clearance. Silica and thorium dioxide, thought to inhibit macrophage function, likewise failed to abolish resistance. Regenerating liver tissue did not support more extensive virus replication than did intact adult liver.
Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) are frequently used in cosmetics, paints, sunscreens and the like. Recent studies have demonstrated that nano-TiO2 might be deleterious for the male reproductive function. However, the effects of pubertal nano-TiO2 exposure on testosterone (T) synthesis and spermatogenesis remained to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of pubertal nano-TiO2 exposure on the synthesis of T and spermatogenesis. Nano-TiO2 was orally administered daily to Kunming male mice from 28th postnatal day (PND 28) to PND 70. The percentage of spermatozoa abnormality in epididymides was markedly increased in mice exposed to nano-TiO2; decreased layers of spermatogenic cells and vacuoles in seminiferous tubules were also observed in the nano-TiO2 treated group. In addition, pubertal nano-TiO2 exposure significantly decreased the serum T levels in male mice. Moreover, mice exposures to nano-TiO2 significantly reduced the expression of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and P450 17α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the testis of mice, while the expression of cytochrome P450-19, a key enzyme for the translation of T to estradiol (E2), was increased. Taken together, these results indicated that nano-TiO2 could influence the levels of serum T through changes in both the synthesis and translation of T. Furthermore, the decreased serum T synthesis might contribute to the reduced spermatogenesis in mice exposed to nano-TiO2.
Isoniazid, efficient antituberculosis drug, can provoke neuropsychiatric manifestations at certain patients. Two mechanisms of action for isoniazid-related psychosis are kept by the majority of authors: pyridoxin deficiency isoniazid toxicity, molecule near chemically to iproniazid, powerful IMAO (monoamine oxydase inhibitor). The predisposing factors are: slow acetylator, diabetes, hepatic insufficiency, old age, alcoholism. Family and personal history of mental illness are also predisposing factors. We report here the observation of a 53-year-old man presented with psychotic symptoms suspected to be relation with isoniazid. The favorable evolution after the definitive stop of isoniazid therapy is in favor of this hypothesis. Although rare, the neuropsychiatric symptoms during tuberculosis treatment by isoniazid, the possibility of iatrogenic etiology must be evoked. Isoniazid, antituberculosis very used in Africa, is mentioned by several authors like the cause of psychiatric disorders. Pyridoxin deficiency seems to play a role of trigger. Supplementation with vitamin B6 during the treatment by isoniazid must be therefore systematic to warm these unrests.
Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key enzyme involved in neoplastic lipogenesis. Overexpression of FASN is common in many cancers, and accumulating evidence suggests that it is a metabolic oncogene with an important role in tumor growth and survival, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Early small-molecule FASN inhibitors such as cerulenin, C75 and orlistat have been shown to induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines and to induce tumor growth delay in several cancer xenograft models but their mechanism is still not well understood. These molecules suffer from pharmacological limitations and weight loss as a side effect that prevent their development as systemic drugs. Several potent inhibitors have recently been reported that may help to unravel and exploit the full potential of FASN as a target for cancer therapy in the near future. Furthermore, novel sources of FASN inhibitors, such as green tea and dietary soy, make both dietary manipulation and chemoprevention potential alternative modes of therapy in the future.
Tetrandrine (TET), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Stephania tetrandra S. Moore of the Menispermaceae, possesses anti-inflammatory activity. We examined the effect of tetrandrine on interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-provoked inflammatory response in mesangial cells.
Primary rat mesangial cells (PRMCs) were treated with IL-1β to induce inflammation to resemble glomerulonephritis. Cell viability, morphology and NO production were evaluated. Western blotting was applied for expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and NF-κB-related molecules. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to examine the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB.
TET, at concentrations up to 10 μg/ml, had no significant effect on viability of PRMCs. At non-toxic concentrations, TET inhibited expression of phosphorylated ERK as well as phosphorylated IKK, enhanced degradation of IκBα and reduced the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in IL-1β-primed PRMCs, suggesting an inhibitory effect on ERK/NF-κB signaling. TET attenuated the IL-1β-provoked expression of iNOS and release of NO. Moreover, both the protein expression and gelatinase activity of MMP-9, but not MMP-2, were markedly suppressed by TET.
TET down-regulated ERK/NF-κB signaling and inhibited the expression of inflammatory mediators NO and MMP-9. Since these mediators appear to activate mesangial cells, TET may play an important role in prevention of glomerulonephritis.
Three (and possibly all four) elderly hypertensive patients who were followed sequentially after discontinuation of transdermal clonidine monotherapy manifested a rapid rise in blood pressure to levels above control (pre- and post-therapy) readings. No signs of an "overshoot" in plasma norepinephrine levels or symptoms of beta-adrenergic overactivity were seen. Such rebound hypertension suggests hypersensitivity to alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation and could pose a heretofore unreported potential hazard to elderly or otherwise compromised patients who discontinue transdermal clonidine therapy.
Sodium thiopental in the comatogenic (but not soporogenic) dose caused hyperammoniemia in rats. Blood ammonium level increased 3-fold within 3 h and 5-fold within 18 h. Blood urea level increased by one-third within 18 h against the background of unchanged creatinine level and hematocrit. Urinary excretion of ammonium did not decrease, while its release with exhaled air increased, indicating intensification of ammonium formation in the body. Barbiturate coma did not change the slope of curves of dose-dependent increase of ammonium or urea levels in the blood of rats injected with ammonium acetate, which attested to the absence of appreciable disorders in the ammonium detoxifying function of the liver. Ammonium hyperproduction could be caused by gastrointestinal stasis verified by X-ray examination and confirmed by correlation between blood urea level and stool retention in narcotized rats.
The effect of acutely elevated serum magnesium on the CNS and cardiac toxicity of bupivacaine was studied. Anesthesia was induced in mongrel dogs with thiopental, 25 mg/kg, and ventilation was controlled. Sedation was maintained with fentanyl (25 micrograms/kg bolus and 5 micrograms.kg-1h-1) and pancuronium (0.15 mg/kg bolus and 0.05 mg.kg-1h-1) provided paralysis. Two hours after the thiopental bolus, all animals received an intravenous (iv) infusion of bupivacaine (1 mg.kg-1 min-1). The control group (5 animals) received bupivacaine only. The Mg++ group (5 animals) received MgSO4 140 mg/kg iv and 80 mg.kg-1 h-1 15 min prior to beginning the bupivacaine infusion. Lead II ECG, cardiac hemodynamics, and two-channel EEG were continuously monitored. Serum magnesium concentrations in the Mg++ group rose from 0.67 mM (1.3 mEq/L) to 2.42 mM (4.8 mEq/L). The bupivacaine infusion caused PR and QRS interval prolongation in both groups, but QRS widening was greater in the control group. QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTIc) lengthened only in the control group. A depression of left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) occurred to an equal extent in both groups. The seizure dose of bupivacaine was not different between the two groups: 12.9 +/- 2.3 (SEM) mg/kg in the control group and 13.9 +/- 2.5 mg/kg in the Mg++ group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The cardiovascular effects of microinjection of the amino acids glutamate and glycine within the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) after swimming training (ST) in unrestrained awake rats were investigated. Unilateral microinjection of l-glutamate (5, 20 and 50 mM, in 100 nl) produced a dose dependent increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in control (C) (16+/-5 mm Hg; 29+/-6 mm Hg; 43+/-6 mm Hg) and swim (SW) (1+/-1 mm Hg; 16+/-2 mm Hg; 25+/-3 mm Hg) groups. However, the magnitude of this response was lower in the swim group. Prazosin injection produced hypotension and tachycardia in both groups (C=-43+/-3 mm Hg/98+/-16 bpm; SW=-61+/-5 mm Hg/115+/-32 bpm). In the SW group the hypotension caused by prazosin was greater compared to C group, but the tachycardia was not different between them. After prazosin, glutamate response in RVLM was blocked in both groups as well. When glycine (10 mM or 1 M, in 100 nl) were microinjected into the RVLM of C group we observed two different effects: decrease in MAP with the lower dose and an increase in MAP with the higher dose (10 mM=-13+/-2 mm Hg; 1 M=47+/-6 mm Hg). However, after ST the hypertensive response to glycine was blunted with no alterations in the hypotensive response (10 mM=-14+/-1 mm Hg; 1 M=18+/-4 mm Hg). These findings suggest that RVLM is involved in the modulation of the sympathetic outflow to the cardiovascular system during exercise training.
We recently reported that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is upregulated in the rat small intestine after administration of indomethacin, and this may be the key to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced intestinal damage. The present study investigated the mechanism for COX-2 expression induced in the rat small intestine by indomethacin, in relation with ulcerogenic processes.
Animals were given indomethacin or SC-560 p.o., and the intestinal mucosa was examined 24 h later.
Indomethacin caused hemorrhagic lesions in the small intestine, accompanied with an increase in intestinal motility, bacterial invasion and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, as well as the expression of COX-2 mRNA in the mucosa. Although SC-560 did not cause any damage, this agent caused intestinal hypermotility, the bacterial invasion and the upregulation of COX-2 expression. The mucosal PGE2 content was decreased by SC-560 at 3 h but recovered 12 h later, and this recovery of PGE2 was attenuated by both atropine and ampicillin, in addition to rofecoxib. The intestinal hypermotility response to indomethacin was prevented by both 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 and atropine, but not ampicillin. Yet all these agents inhibited not only the bacterial invasion but also the expression of COX-2 and iNOS activity in the intestinal mucosa following indomethacin treatment, resulting in the prevention of intestinal lesions.
These results suggest that COX-2 expression in the intestinal mucosa following the administration of indomethacin is associated with intestinal hypermotility and bacterial invasion. The intestinal hypermotility caused by COX-1 inhibition may be a key to COX-2 expression after administration of NSAIDs and their intestinal ulcerogenic properties.
Biliary pseudolithiasis has been reported in patients who received ceftriaxone therapy. To examine this phenomenon further, serial gallbladder sonograms were evaluated in 44 adult patients who received intravenous ceftriaxone at 2 g or a placebo daily for 14 days in a double-blind controlled study. Ultrasound examinations of gallbladders were performed on days 1 and 14 of therapy and 2 weeks posttherapy if abnormalities were observed on day 14. Eight patients were unevaluable because of abnormal base-line gallbladder sonograms. Thirty-six patients (ceftriaxone, n = 28; placebo, n = 8) demonstrated normal baseline gallbladder sonograms and were evaluated for the development of change. A total of 6 of 28 (21.4%) ceftriaxone-treated patients and 1 of 8 (12.5%) patients who received the placebo demonstrated abnormal gallbladder sonograms on day 14 (P = 0.491). Four of the six ceftriaxone-treated patients demonstrating abnormal sonograms were clinically asymptomatic, while two patients reported vomiting. The abnormal sonograms of gallbladders of patients treated with ceftriaxone returned to normal between 9 and 26 days posttherapy. These data suggest an association between ceftriaxone treatment and the development of gallbladder abnormalities on ultrasound examination which resolve spontaneously on discontinuation of ceftriaxone therapy.
