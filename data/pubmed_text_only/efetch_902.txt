Picolinic, kynurenic, xanthurenic and anthranilic acids are metabolites of L-kynurenine which, when administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) antagonized (in descending order of potency) the seizures induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of l-kynurenine sulfate in SHR and C57BL/6 mice. Picolinic and anthranilic acids were also effective after oral administration. Picolinic acid completely prevented seizures. Kynurenic acid, when injected i.c.v. prior to l-kynurenine sulfate, appeared to be more effective than after i.p. administration while picolinic and anthranilic acids were less effective. This suggest that the antikynurenine effect of metabolites of kynurenine (kynurenines) is related to different brain structures, i.e. kynurenic acid predominantly affects structures adjacent to ventricles (e.g. hippocampus, caudate nucleus) while picolinic and anthranilic acids act on other brain structures or the periphery. Xanthurenic, kynurenic and picolinic acids merely prolonged the latency of seizures induced by i.c.v. quinolinic acid (another metabolite of kynurenine) or by subcutaneous strychnine sulfate and i.p. pentylenetetrazole, and did not modify seizures induced by i.p. caffeine and thiosemicarbazide. This selective antagonism of the tested kynurenines against kynurenine might be an important anticonvulsant factor in kynurenine-dependent seizures. It is suggested that increased excretion of xanthurenic, kynurenic and picolinic acids in patients with convulsive states may be manifestations of compensatory processes.
Glucosamine sulfate (GS) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis. The mechanism of the action of this drug does, however, remain to be elucidated. In human osteoarthritic chondrocytes (HOC) stimulated with a proinflammatory cytokine, we studied whether GS could modify the NFkappaB activity and the expression of COX-2, a NFkappaB-dependent gene.
Using HOC in culture stimulated with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), the effects of GS on NFkappaB activation, nuclear translocation of NFkappaB/Rel family members, COX-1 and COX-2 expressions and syntheses and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentration were studied.
GS significantly inhibited NFkappaB activity in a dose-dependent manner, as well as the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 proteins. Furthermore, GS-preincubated IL-1beta-stimulated HOC showed an increase in IkappaBalpha in the cell cytoplasm in comparison with HOC incubated with IL-1beta alone. GS also inhibited the gene expression and the protein synthesis of COX-2 induced by IL-1beta, while no effect on COX-1 synthesis was seen. GS also inhibited the release of PGE2 to conditioned media of HOC stimulated with IL-1beta.
GS inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators in HOC stimulated with IL-1beta through a NFkappaB-dependent mechanism. Our study further supports the role of GS as a symptom- and structure-modifying drug in the treatment of OA.
Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) has attracted attention since abnormal supragranular mossy fiber sprouting occurs in the same region, in temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, we submitted developing rats to pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) to study the relationship between neurogenesis and mossy fiber sprouting. Groups were submitted to SE at: I-P9, II-P7, P8 and P9, III-P17 e IV-P21. Neurogenesis was quantified using BrdU protocol and confirmed through double staining, using neuronal pentraxin. Other animals were monitored by video system until P120 and their brain was studied (Timm and Nissl staining). The neurogenesis at P17 (p=0.007) and P21 (p=0.006) were increased. However, only P21 group showed recurrent seizures and the mossy fiber sprouting in the same region, during adult life, while P17 did not. Thus, our results suggest that neurogenesis is not related to mossy fiber sprouting neither to recurrent spontaneous seizures in pilocarpine model.
This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the level of aortic blood pressure affects the rate and extent of coronary thrombolysis induced by intracoronary administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA).
Although many studies have confirmed the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, the effects of altered blood pressure on coronary thrombolysis have not been studied. Because the aortic pressure represents the coronary artery inflow pressure, first principles predict that changes in blood pressure will affect the delivery of the thrombolytic agent and thus affect thrombolysis.
The effects of large changes in blood pressure on coronary thrombolysis were studied in a canine model. Coronary thrombosis was induced by injection of radioactive blood clot through a catheter placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Subsequently, 24 dogs were classified into three groups of 8 dogs each: Group 1 dogs underwent phlebotomy to adjust systolic blood pressure to 130 mm Hg; Group 2 dogs underwent phlebotomy to decrease systolic blood pressure to 75 mm Hg. Dogs in Group 3 also underwent phlebotomy to achieve a systolic blood pressure of 75 mm Hg and then received norepinephrine to increase this pressure to 130 mm Hg. After adjustment in blood pressure, all dogs received an infusion of rt-PA (0.25 mg/kg body weight) over 30 min through the left anterior descending artery catheter. In a fourth group of six dogs, the effect of altered blood pressure on the rate of coronary thrombolysis was assessed.
In dogs in Groups 1 and 3, the rate and extent of coronary thrombolysis were significantly increased compared with values in Group 2. In each of the six Group 4 dogs the rate of coronary thrombolysis increased when norepinephrine increased systolic blood pressure from 75 to 130 mm Hg.
These results indicate that a moderate increase in coronary inflow pressure increases the rate and extent of coronary thrombolysis compared with values during marked systemic hypotension.
Recent studies suggest that low-dose oral contraceptives may cause acquired resistance to activated protein C (APC). The aims of this study were to determine whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may also induce acquired APC resistance and to study the effects of APC resistance on the risk of recurrent thrombosis. The patients comprised 140 females with at least one previous venous thromboembolism (VTE), who were randomized to receive continuous treatment with 2 mg 17-beta-oestradiol and 1 mg norethisterone acetate (n = 71) or placebo (n = 69). Normalized APC sensitivity ratios (nAPCsr) were calculated by measurement of the effect of APC on thrombin generation in plasma collected at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Of the 140 women, 121 had plasma samples collected both at baseline and after 3 months. The nAPCsr increased significantly (P < 0.001) on HRT (n = 62), both in females not carrying the factor V(Leiden) mutation [mean change 0.57 (95% CI 0.45-0.70), n = 50] and in females heterozygous for the factor V(Leiden) mutation [mean change 1.10 (0.71-1.49), n = 12], but remained unchanged on placebo (n = 59). The baseline nAPCsr as well as the increase in nAPCsr associated with HRT use was not higher in the five women who subsequently developed recurrent VTE. Free protein S and free TFPI were both important parameters for the acquired APC resistant phenotype. We conclude that HRT diminishes the efficacy by which APC downregulates in-vitro thrombin formation in a similar fashion to that observed with low-dose oral contraceptives, but the increase in nAPCsr alone is not sufficient to explain the increased risk of VTE associated with use of HRT.
Pentazocine is a frequently used analgesic drug. Numerous complications have been reported in association with its use, including skin fibrosis, skin ulceration, abnormal skin pigmentation and symmetrical myopathy. Fibrous myopathy is a rare but conspicuous complication of prolonged pentazocine injection. However, inflammatory myopathy has not previously been related to this substance abuse. We describe a patient who developed polymyositis after 13 months of pentazocine injections.
The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of pulmonary complications, feasibility of early hospital discharge and requirements for postoperative inotropic and chronotropic support in patients receiving amiodarone therapy before heart transplantation.
Although many patients waiting for heart transplantation will die of arrhythmias before a donor heart is found, the use of amiodarone has been limited by concern about increased complications in the perioperative period.
The 29 patients receiving amiodarone at the time of heart transplantation at University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center between October 1986 and September 1990 were compared with 29 control recipients to evaluate postoperative morbidity. Patients were receiving amiodarone for recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias (n = 11), atrial fibrillation (n = 2) or complex ventricular ectopic activity (n = 16). The average daily dose was 360 +/- 230 mg/day for an average of 11 +/- 22 months before transplantation. Amiodarone and control groups had a similar ejection fraction (0.18 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.08), frequency of coronary disease, age and gender. There were three more status I patients in the control group. OKT3 was given to only two patients receiving amiodarone and 12 control patients at high risk for renal dysfunction.
Postoperatively, the duration of assisted ventilation was 21 +/- 19 h after amiodarone therapy versus 26 +/- 2 h in the control group (20 +/- 18 h vs. 15 +/- 9 h after excluding patients receiving OKT3), discharge arterial oxygen saturation was > 95% in both groups. Two patients in the amiodarone group with a smoking history of > 100 pack-years developed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates of brief duration. Although patients receiving amiodarone required atrial pacing more frequently (eight vs. two patients) and had a lower heart rate at discharge (75 +/- 18 vs. 86 +/- 11 beats/min), the duration of inotropic support (2.1 +/- 1.5 vs. 3.5 +/- 2.5 days) and of hospital stay (10 +/- 3 vs. 15 +/- 10 days) was not higher in the amiodarone than in the control group. The mortality rate at 30 days was similar in the two groups (6.8% vs. 3.4%, p = NS).
Amiodarone therapy before heart transplantation may contribute to occasional pulmonary complications but does not significantly increase perioperative morbidity or mortality with the regimens used in this retrospective study.
Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and immune serum globulin (ISG) were examined in a randomized, double-blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing type B hepatitis after needle-stick exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG)-positive donors. Clinical hepatitis developed in 1.4% of HBIG and in 5.9% of ISG recipients (P = 0.016), and seroconversion (anti-HBs) occurred in 5.6% and 20.7% of them respectively (P less than 0.001). Mild and transient side-effects were noted in 3.0% of ISG and in 3.2% of HBIG recipients. Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase (DNAP) and e antigen and antibody (HBeAg; anti-HBE). Both DNAP and HBeAg showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of HBsAg-positive donors. Hepatitis B immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing type B hepatitis even when the analysis was confined to these two high-risk subgroups. The efficacy of ISG in preventing type B hepatitis cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included.
A prospective, randomised, multicentre, single-blind comparison of propranolol with placebo in the primary prevention of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage was conducted in 230 cirrhotic patients with large oesophageal varices. The dose of propranolol was progressively increased until resting heart rate was reduced by 20 to 25%. The final doses were 40 mg of conventional propranolol and 160 and 320 mg of long-acting propranolol daily in 22, 60 and 18% of patients, respectively. Patients who survived without bleeding were followed up for 436 +/- 172 days (mean +/- SD). After 2 years, the cumulative percentages of patients free from bleeding were 74% in the propranolol group and 39% in the placebo group (p less than 0.05). Similarly, cumulative 2-year survival was 72% in the propranolol group and 51% in the placebo group (p less than 0.05). Propranolol was well tolerated and only 13 patients were withdrawn from treatment. We concluded that propranolol treatment decreased the incidence of first bleeding and death during a period of 2 years in patients with cirrhosis and large esophageal varices.
Lumbosacral plexus block is a valuable anesthetic technic in the hands of an experineced anesthesiologist. However, as illustrated by this case report, anesthetic dosage must be selected with great care, and patients unable to describe paresthesias should be excluded from use of this procedure.
An in vitro method to predict phospholipidosis-inducing potential of cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) was developed using biochemical and physicochemical assays. The following parameters were applied to principal component analysis, as well as physicochemical parameters: pK(a) and clogP; dissociation constant of CADs from phospholipid, inhibition of enzymatic phospholipid degradation, and metabolic stability of CADs. In the score plot, phospholipidosis-inducing drugs (amiodarone, propranolol, imipramine, chloroquine) were plotted locally forming the subspace for positive CADs; while non-inducing drugs (chlorpromazine, chloramphenicol, disopyramide, lidocaine) were placed scattering out of the subspace, allowing a clear discrimination between both classes of CADs. CADs that often produce false results by conventional physicochemical or cell-based assay methods were accurately determined by our method. Basic and lipophilic disopyramide could be accurately predicted as a nonphospholipidogenic drug. Moreover, chlorpromazine, which is often falsely predicted as a phospholipidosis-inducing drug by in vitro methods, could be accurately determined. Because this method uses the pharmacokinetic parameters pK(a), clogP, and metabolic stability, which are usually obtained in the early stages of drug development, the method newly requires only the two parameters, binding to phospholipid, and inhibition of lipid degradation enzyme. Therefore, this method provides a cost-effective approach to predict phospholipidosis-inducing potential of a drug.
Dietary isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein, are metabolised by the human gut microflora. Case-control studies have disclosed a link between the formation of the daidzein metabolite equol and prostate cancer risk. We evaluated the effects of genistein, daidzein and five metabolites on two prostate cancer cell lines by determining DNA integrity and cell growth. LNCaP cells contain the T877A androgen receptor mutation whereas Los Angeles prostate cancer (LAPC)-4 cells express the wild-type receptor, both of which may affect responses to isoflavones. DNA integrity was determined using the comet assay. Cell growth was assessed by staining DNA with 4',6'-diamidino-2-pheylindole hydrochloride. Endogenous steroid hormones, but not isoflavones, induced DNA strand breaks. Dihydrotestosterone stimulated the growth of both cell lines. 17beta-Oestradiol increased the growth of LNCaP but not LAPC-4 cells, pointing to an involvement of the T877A androgen receptor. Isoflavones did not stimulate growth in either prostate cancer cell line. However, the growth of LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells was suppressed by genistein (inhibitory concentration 50 % (IC50) 39.7 mumol/l, 37.2 mumol/l) and by equol (IC50 53.8 mumol/l, 35.1 mumol/l). O-desmethylangolensin inhibited the growth of LAPC-4 cells (IC50 45.2 mumol/l), but not of LNCaP cells. In conclusion, isoflavones do not damage DNA or promote growth of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. Several isoflavones, including the reduced daidzein metabolites equol and O-desmethylangolensin, suppress cancer cell growth. Taken together, these data suggest a contribution of gut-formed isoflavone metabolites to the beneficial effects of dietary isoflavones on prostate cancer risk.
Prevention of retinoic acid-induced craniofacial abnormalities by folinic acid, and endothelin-1 (ET-1)/dHAND protein and mRNA expression were investigated in mouse embryos using the whole embryo culture, streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex method, and whole-mount in situ hybridization. In the whole embryo culture, 1.0 and 0.1 mm-folinic acid dose dependently prevented branchial region malformations and decreased defects by 93 % and 77 %, respectively. Folinic acid at concentrations of 1.0 and 0.1 mm significantly increased ET-1 and dHAND protein expression levels compared to retinoic acid-exposed values in embryonic branchial areas. Folinic acid also increased ET-1 and dHAND mRNA levels in the same region. The present results suggest that folinic acid may prevent retinoic acid-induced craniofacial abnormalities via increasing ET-1 and dHAND levels in the branchial region during the organogenic period.
The Eker rat is an animal model of renal carcinogenesis and carries a transposon insertion in the Tsc2 (tuberous sclerosis-2) gene. We previously generated transgenic Eker rats and identified coding sequences in the Tsc2 gene that are responsible for suppression of renal carcinogenesis in Eker rats. Tsc2-RGH, a transgene that expresses the carboxy terminal region (amino acids 1425-1755) of the Tsc2 product (tuberin), partially suppressed renal carcinogenesis. However, Tsc2-DRG, which expresses a mutant tuberin lacking the carboxy-terminal region (Delta aa 1425-1755), did not suppress renal carcinogenesis. Here, we found that introduction of both Tsc2-RGH and Tsc2-DRG in Eker rats completely suppressed renal carcinogenesis and rescued homozygous (Tsc2(Ek/Ek)) mutants from embryonic lethality in a complementary manner. Co-introduction of Tsc2-RGH and Tsc2-DRG, but not introduction of either alone, efficiently suppressed phosphorylation of p70 S6K. Thus, the functional domains of N-terminal hamartin binding and C-terminal tumor suppression in tuberin can separate in vivo.
A study was made of ketamine hydrochloride's effectiveness in decreasing viseral pain in 50 patients undergoing postpartum abdominal tubal ligation, a procedure involving visceral pain but not requiring muscular relaxation. Patients were pre-medicated and ketamine was administered (10 mg/ml intravenously) until the patient no longer responded to surgical stimulae. The majority of patients (39) required 1 mg/kg of ketamine for induction and repeated doses of 20 mg each, every 5 minutes, for maintenance (31 patients). Analgesic effectiveness was judged on the following basis: Good - no movement or phonation during surgery (74 percent); Fair - slight limb movement or occasional phonation (20 percent); Poor - gross movement or loud phonation (6 percent). On the average blood pressure rose 14 percent, heart rate 21 percent, and respiratory rate 34 percent. Some dizziness was experienced by all patients. Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference was increased in several cases; possibly due to increase in right-to-left pulmonary blood shunt. Ketamine was found to be an adequate anaesthetic in 94% of patients with administered doses well below recommended amounts.
We report a case of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction complicating steroid therapy in an infant undergoing allogeneic transplant in the first few weeks of life for treatment of Krabbe's disease. While this complication is well known to those treating premature infants, it has not been reported in the stem cell transplant setting. For young infants undergoing allogeneic transplant who require steroid therapy, cardiac monitoring after 2--3 weeks of therapy is recommended.
In 16-day-old rabbits treated with dichlorvos 8 mg/kg per os the activity of monoamine oxidase A form (MAO A) in brain was studied. A short-lasting decrease of brain MAO A was followed by a recovery of enzyme activity within 120 min. In parallel to changes in MAO A activity breathing disturbances were observed. It is concluded that the decrease of MAO A was due rather to hypoxia than to a direct effect of dichlorvos. In 16-day-old rabbits clorgyline (2 mg/kg) and tranylcypromine (10 mg/kg) were potent inhibitors of MAO A but deprenyl and pargyline were ineffective.
Lithium has been reported to raise serum calcium and lower serum phosphate concentrations and to increase urinary calcium excretion. Because these changes may be effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH was measured in 19 patients receiving lithium. PTH was significantly higher in these patients than in 150 normal subjects. For all patients serum calcium concentrations correlated significantly with serum lithium concentrations. These results indicate that lithium may cause biochemical hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism in certain patients with lithium nephrotoxicity is also possible.
Oncogenic gene fusions involving the 3' region of ROS1 kinase have been identified in various human cancers. In this study, we sought to characterize ROS1 fusion genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and establish the fusion proteins as drug targets.
An NSCLC tissue microarray (TMA) panel containing 447 samples was screened for ROS1 rearrangement by FISH. This assay was also used to screen patients with NSCLC. In positive samples, the identity of the fusion partner was determined through inverse PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR. In addition, the clinical efficacy of ROS1 inhibition was assessed by treating a ROS1-positive patient with crizotinib. The HCC78 cell line, which expresses the SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion, was treated with kinase inhibitors that have activity against ROS1. The effects of ROS1 inhibition on proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and cell signaling pathways were analyzed by MTS assay, flow cytometry, and Western blotting.
In the TMA panel, 5 of 428 (1.2%) evaluable samples were found to be positive for ROS1 rearrangement. In addition, 1 of 48 patients tested positive for rearrangement, and this patient showed tumor shrinkage upon treatment with crizotinib. The patient and one TMA sample displayed expression of the recently identified SDC4-ROS1 fusion, whereas two TMA samples expressed the CD74-ROS1 fusion and two others expressed the SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion. In HCC78 cells, treatment with ROS1 inhibitors was antiproliferative and downregulated signaling pathways that are critical for growth and survival.
ROS1 inhibition may be an effective treatment strategy for the subset of patients with NSCLC whose tumors express ROS1 fusion genes.
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is a recently described disorder with typical radiologic findings in the posterior regions of the cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum. The symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, focal neurologic deficits, and seizures. A 10-year-old male was hit on his back, resulting in backache. He was medicated with sodium diclofenate and mefenamic acid. The next day, he had edema and oliguria. By the third day, his blood pressure increased and he began to experience restlessness and worsening mental status. He then complained of headache and visual disturbances and had a seizure. A magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed abnormalities in the posterior regions of the cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum. The patient was treated with antiepileptics and calcium antagonists. His hypertension and seizures were well controlled. On the 22nd day, he was discharged without any neurologic or renal deficits. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome does not occur frequently in childhood, and this is the first case report of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. One should consider reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome as a side effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in daily medical treatment.
Effect of aspirin (1.2 mg/100 g body wt orally for 30 days) on myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol (200 mg/kg body wt, subcutaneously for 2 days) has been studied in rats using activities of creatine kinase, aspartate amino transaminase, alanine amino transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase and levels of lipid peroxides as standard markers. Aspirin treatment is found to counteract the effect of isoproterenol on lipid peroxide formation and associated enzyme changes in serum and heart.
We have previously reported that daunomycin rats can be used as an experimental model of chronic renal failure. We have since studied whether the result were reproducible by repeating the experiment. In this experiment we used larger numbers of rats and many more parameters of investigation compared with the previous experiment. The period of observation was extended to 42 weeks. Twenty-one female Wistar rats were given an injection of 12 mg/Kg of daunomycin into the jugular vein by the one-shot method. Ten control rats were injected with physiological saline. Eighteen daunomycin rats developed chronic renal failure within the observation period. Renal failure was confirmed by the levels of BUN and creatinine, the uremic peak 2a and the pathological findings. One rat died from a tumor and another rat died from thrombosis of the descending aorta. In only one rat was not at the level defined as chronic renal failure, although it was impaired even in this case. There was a correlation between the lifespan of the daunomycin rats and the amount of urine protein at 4 weeks. Rats with heavy proteinuria at 4 weeks died of uremia at an early age. There was a variety of evidence of daunomycin damage when rats were autopsied, not only in the renal glomeruli but also in the pancreas, liver and spleen. Some parts of the pancreas and liver showed vacuolated cells. We supposed that these various changes of many internal organs of daunomycin rats were secondary changes for chronic renal failure. We reconfirmed that daunomycin rats can be used as an experimental model of chronic renal failure.
In the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors, the T315I gatekeeper mutant has emerged as resistant to all currently approved agents. This report describes the structure-guided design of a novel series of potent pan-inhibitors of BCR-ABL, including the T315I mutation. A key structural feature is the carbon-carbon triple bond linker which skirts the increased bulk of Ile315 side chain. Extensive SAR studies led to the discovery of development candidate 20g (AP24534), which inhibited the kinase activity of both native BCR-ABL and the T315I mutant with low nM IC(50)s, and potently inhibited proliferation of corresponding Ba/F3-derived cell lines. Daily oral administration of 20g significantly prolonged survival of mice injected intravenously with BCR-ABL(T315I) expressing Ba/F3 cells. These data, coupled with a favorable ADME profile, support the potential of 20g to be an effective treatment for CML, including patients refractory to all currently approved therapies.
