Epidemiological studies have shown that hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-cholesterol were both associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia is now recognized as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. Secondary prevention trials (e.g., LOCAT, BECAIT, BIP and DAIS) in coronary artery disease with drugs acting primarily on triglycerides (e.g., the PPAR-alpha activators bezafibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozil) have shown that reducing triglycerides and increasing HDL-cholesterol, without significantly affecting LDL-cholesterol, slows down coronary artery luminal narrowing. Furthermore, the VA-HIT study recently showed that gemfibrozil decreased coronary artery disease mortality in secondary prevention trials, partly by increasing HDL-cholesterol. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (i.e., PPAR-alpha, -beta(delta) and -gamma) form a subfamily of the nuclear receptor gene family. Whereas all PPARs are, albeit to differing extents, activated by fatty acids and derivatives, PPAR-alpha binds the hypolipidemic fibrates. PPAR-alpha activation mediates changes in lipoprotein metabolism. Moreover, PPAR-alpha activators increase hepatic uptake and esterification of free fatty acids, in addition to increasing mitochondrial free fatty acid uptake and the resulting free fatty acid oxidation. The effect of fibrates on the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is due to a PPAR-alpha-dependent stimulation of lipoprotein lipase and of apolipoprotein (apo)A-V and to an inhibition of apoC-III expression, whereas the increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol depends partly on an overexpression of apoA-I and apoA-II. PPARs are also expressed in atherosclerotic lesions.
Among the cytostatic drugs only the alkylating agents have been firmly established as being leukaemogenic. This report describes 4 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia and 1 of myelodysplasia occurring in a cohort of 212 patients with germ-cell tumours treated with etoposide, cisplatin, and bleomycin. The mean cumulative risk of leukaemic complications was 4.7% (SE 2.3) 5.7 years after start of etoposide-containing chemotherapy, and, compared with the risk in the general population, the relative risk of overt leukaemia was 336 (95% CI 92-861). No leukaemias were detected in a previous cohort of 127 patients with germ-cell tumours treated with cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine. The increased risk of leukaemia was most probably due to etoposide alone or in combination with cisplatin or bleomycin, since other published work has also not revealed an excess of leukaemias among patients with germ-cell tumours treated with only cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine. The risk of leukaemia was dose related since all 5 patients with leukaemic complications were among the 82 who had received a cumulative dose of more than 2000 mg/m2 etoposide, whereas no leukaemias were observed among 130 patients who had received up to 2000 mg/m2 (p = 0.004). 3 of the leukaemic patients had balanced chromosome translocations affecting bands 11q23 and 21q22. These translocations, and perhaps also other balanced aberrations, seem to be characteristic of myelodysplasia and acute leukaemia occurring after therapy with cytostatic agents acting on DNA-topoisomerase II.
High-dose ifosfamide (one or two courses of 6 g/m2) with or without mesna was administered to 13 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The protective effect of 2-mercapto-ethane sulfonate (mesna) against the urotoxic side effects induced by ifosfamide was examined by a randomized crossover trial. A significant reduction in the incidence of hematuria was observed in the patients receiving mesna. Macroscopic hematuria was observed in only one patient who received treatment with mesna versus seven patients treated with ifosfamide alone. Other symptoms, such as frequency and dysuria, tended to be diminished in the patients receiving mesna, although the difference was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that mesna is effective in preventing or diminishing ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Concomitant use of mesna should allow the administration of a high dose of ifosfamide although more extensive studies are needed to define the optimal dose and schedule of administration of mesna to prevent or attenuate the hemorrhagic cystitis.
Experimental and clinical data published recently show that dental amalgam can give rise to undesirable immunological responses in susceptible individuals. In genetically susceptible strains of experimental animals, mercury and silver can induce autoimmune responses. Sera of patients sensitive to mercury were found to have a higher incidence of autoantibodies relative to controls.
The aim of this study was to determine possible presence of antinuclear SSB/La autoantibodies after the in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with HgCl2.
Lymphocytes were obtained from patients with autoimmune thyroiditis and increased response to mercury in vitro. Mononuclear cells were cultivated for 6 days with 100 microl HgCl2 solution or with pure medium and the levels of antinuclear autoantibodies SSB/La were assayed by a commercial SSB/La ELISA kit.
Increased production of SSB/La autoantibodies in the media following stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with HgCl2 was found in all cases. Using the Student's paired test, the results were significant on the p=0.05 significance level.
Results imply that, in some patients with thyroiditis, mercury from dental amalgam can stimulate the production of antinuclear antibodies. Dental amalgam may be a risk factor in some patients with autoimmune disease.
Twenty-five patients with essential hypertension were randomly assigned to treatment with either captopril or atenolol. There were 15 males and 10 females and their mean age was 53 years, range 32-66 years. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced by atenolol 50-100 mg once daily. Captopril 25-50 mg 3 times daily caused a significant decrease in supine diastolic but not in systolic blood pressure. After the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (25-50 mg) to those who did not become normotensive (supine diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg) on captopril or atenolol alone, blood pressure was further reduced. Captopril combined with hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced both supine and standing blood pressure by 31/17 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and 33/18 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) respectively. Atenolol combined with hydrochlorothiazide caused a significant decrease of both recumbent and standing blood pressure by 21/10 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and 23/13 mm Hg (p less than 0.05 systolic, p less than 0.001 diastolic). The reduction of systolic blood pressure was significantly better with the captopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination, while there was no difference between the groups as regards diastolic blood pressure reduction. Thus, hydrochlorothiazide potentiates the blood pressure lowering effect of captopril more than of atenolol. This could be due to a synergistic interaction between captopril and hydrochlorothiazide.
Increasing evidence suggests modulating effects of cannabinoids on time of onset, severity, and outcome of schizophrenia. Efforts to discover the underlying pathomechanism have led to the assumption of gene x environment interactions, including premorbid genetical vulnerability and worsening effects of continuing cannabis use. The objective of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the relationship between delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol intake and niacin sensitivity in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Intensity of niacin skin flushing, indicating disturbed prostaglandin-mediated processes, was used as peripheral marker of lipid-arachidonic acid pathways and investigated in cannabis-consuming and nonconsuming schizophrenia patients and in healthy controls. Methylnicotinate was applied in three concentrations onto the forearm skin. Flush response was assessed in 3-min intervals over 15 min using optical reflection spectroscopy. In controls, skin flushing was significantly decreased in cannabis-consuming as compared to nonconsuming individuals. When comparing the nonconsuming subgroups, patients showed significantly decreased flush response. The populations as a whole (patients and controls) showed an inverse association between skin flushing and sum scores of Symptom Check List 90-R. Results demonstrate an impact of long-term cannabis use on lipid-arachidonic acid pathways. Considering pre-existing vulnerability of lipid metabolism in schizophrenia, observed effects of cannabis use support the notion of a gene x environment interaction.
Appearance of dystonic movements in four epileptics children, while carbamazepine administration, is the object of this publication. Human material is formed by four patients in pediatric ages of 4.5, 5, 6 and 7 years old, which presented dystonia after the administration of carbamazepine. Clinical, neuroradiological, psychometric and bioelectric explorations were performed, also serum determinations of anticonvulsant levels. Three of the children presented serious psychomotor retardation. The electroencephalograms showed no uniform changes. Serum levels of carbamazepine were in therapeutics limits. From this personal experience and bibliography data it is deduced that dystonia is not a toxic phenomena, establishing the possibility of an interaction between carbamazepine and dopaminergic system.
The purpose of this study was to compare the subchronic, low-dose effects of clozapine with those of olanzapine in a learned behavioral task previously shown to distinguish between clozapine and haloperidol with acute and subchronic treatment regimes. Rats were trained to use a single forelimb to press a force-recording operandum and simultaneously to lick water from a dipper that remained available while forelimb force exceeded a modest lower limit. Analysis of the resulting forcetime recordings provided measures of task engagement (time on task-analogous to response rate), lick rhythm, tremor, ballistic (maximum force) and tonic (hold force) forelimb force measures, as well as the durations of the individual responses. In a between-groups dosing design, five separate groups of rats received vehicle, clozapine 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg, olanzapine 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg daily for 27 days. A 7-day withdrawal period followed. On days 22 and 26 of antipsychotic drug treatment, all rats additionally received 0.3 mg/kg trihexyphenidyl or 1.0 mg/kg quipazine, respectively. The effects of olanzapine and clozapine were similar in that both drugs reduced time on task, increased response duration, and slowed lick rhythm. The two drugs differed in that clozapine reduced the force and tremor measures but olanzapine did not. Both tolerance and withdrawal effects, as reflected by the tremor measure, were observed for clozapine but not for olanzapine. Trihexyphenidyl further increased the duration of responses already lengthened by clozapine; in contrast, trihexyphenidyl decreased the duration lengthening effect of olanzapine. Taken together, the results indicated that olanzapine did not have the antitremor and hypotonic effects displayed by clozapine, and olanzapine did not induce tolerance and withdrawal phenomena as clozapine did.
Leptin, a product of the obese (ob) gene is present in activated stellate cells. This study investigated whether leptin is essential for the development of hepatic fibrosis caused by various agents.
Control and ob/ob mice were infected with Schistosoma mansoni or were administered chronic carbon tetrachloride to cause hepatic fibrosis.
Fibrosis developed in both ob/ob and control mice. However, the amount of histologically detectable fibrosis and the increase in liver hydroxyproline content was significantly greater in both models of fibrosis for treated controls than for treated ob/ob mice. Fibrosis was associated with higher secretion of TGFbeta1 from spleen cells of treated control than treated ob/ob mice. Chronic leptin administration in ob/ob mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni resulted in an increase in the amount of fibrosis caused by Schistosoma mansoni, eliminating any significant differences in the amount of fibrosis between infected ob/ob mice and control mice. It also eliminated any significant difference in TGFbeta1 secretion between the infected ob/ob and infected control mice.
This study shows that leptin deficiency decreases but does not eliminate hepatic fibrosis produced by Schistosoma mansoni and carbon tetrachloride administration. The effect of leptin in potentiating fibrogenesis is most likely mediated by TGFbeta1.
This study was designed to test the hypothesis that hydrochlorothiazide a diuretic used to treat hypertension depletes body zinc and thereby cause sexual dysfunction. Serum zinc and sexual dysfunction were measured in 39 middle aged hypertensive men who had been taking hydrochlorothiazide in average daily doses of between 25 and 50 mg daily for at least six months, and a control group of 27 unmedicated middle aged normotensive men. The medicated group had a higher incidence of sexual dysfunction (56 pc) as compared to 11 pc in the control group. The use of hydrochlorothiazide did affect serum zinc levels significantly in 20 patients. Sexual dysfunction occurred more often in older and overweight patients (p < 0.004). Three of the normotensive men experienced sexual dysfunction probably related to old age. Twenty two of the 39 on hydrochlorothiazide and experiencing sexual dysfunction were divided into two groups of 11 patients. Bloods were taken from the 27 normotensive and 22 hypertensive men receiving hydrochlorothiazide for the analyses of zinc. Subsequently one group of the patients were supplemented with zinc 500 mg daily for 30 days while the other group was supplemented with magnesium chloride 1 g daily for 30 days. The normotensive men were not treated. After 30 days, bloods were again taken from the three groups of analyses for zinc and magnesium. Serum zinc was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) by hydrochlorothiazide and a non significant decrease in serum magnesium (p = ns) was observed. After supplementation with zinc, the serum zinc levels returned to normal only in eight patients. There was improvement in the symptoms of sexual dysfunction in five patients. Two patients gained weight. Hydrochlorothiazide decreased serum zinc levels (p < 0.05) and was unchanged with magnesium supplementation but the serum magnesium returned to normal values. Improvement of symptoms of sexual dysfunction was positive in one patient. This study shows that low serum zinc levels may be associated with sexual dysfunction but the definitive role of zinc in the pathogenesis of sexual dysfunction will remain controversial.
The contribution of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced hyperalgesia was investigated in the hairy skin of the rat hindpaw using the Randall-Selitto paw-withdrawal test. Although without effect alone, guanosine-5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP gamma S) and cholera toxin--which activate Gs--both increased, while guanosine-5'-[beta-thio] diphosphate (GDP beta S)--which prevents the activation of Gs--decreased the hyperalgesia induced by PGE2. These data support the hypothesis that the action of PGE2 on primary afferent nociceptors leading to decreases in paw-withdrawal threshold is Gs-mediated.
Hepatotoxicity is associated with major changes in liver gene expression induced by xenobiotic exposure. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is critical for its clinical diagnosis and treatment. MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression that control mRNA stability and translation, during normal development and pathology. The canonical technique to measure gene transcript levels is Real-Time qPCR, which has been successfully modified to determine the levels of microRNAs as well. However, in order to obtain accurate data in a multi-step method like RT-qPCR, the normalization with endogenous, stably expressed reference genes is mandatory. Since the expression stability of candidate reference genes varies greatly depending on experimental factors, the aim of our study was to identify a combination of genes for optimal normalization of microRNA and mRNA qPCR expression data in experimental models of acute hepatotoxicity. Rats were treated with four traditional hepatotoxins: acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride, D-galactosamine and thioacetamide, and the liver expression levels of two groups of candidate reference genes, one for microRNA and the other for mRNA normalization, were determined by RT-qPCR in compliance with the MIQE guidelines. In the present study, we report that traditional reference genes such as U6 spliceosomal RNA, Beta Actin and Glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase altered their expression in response to classic hepatotoxins and therefore cannot be used as reference genes in hepatotoxicity studies. Stability rankings of candidate reference genes, considering only those that did not alter their expression, were determined using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper software packages. The potential candidates whose measurements were stable were further tested in different combinations to find the optimal set of reference genes that accurately determine mRNA and miRNA levels. Finally, the combination of MicroRNA-16/5S Ribosomal RNA and Beta 2 Microglobulin/18S Ribosomal RNA were validated as optimal reference genes for microRNA and mRNA quantification, respectively, in rat models of acute hepatotoxicity.
Carvedilol is a useful cardiovascular drug for treating heart failure, however, the in vitro effect on many cell types is unclear. In human MG63 osteosarcoma cells, the effect of carvedilol on intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and cytotoxicity was explored by using fura-2 and tetrazolium, respectively. Carvedilol at concentrations greater than 1 microM caused a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50=15 microM). Carvedilol-induced [Ca2+]i rise was reduced by 60% by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Carvedilol-induced Mn2+-associated quench of intracellular fura-2 fluorescence also suggests that carvedilol induced extracellular Ca2+ influx. In Ca2+-free medium, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, caused a monophasic [Ca2+]i rise, after which the increasing effect of carvedilol on [Ca2+]i was inhibited by 50%. Conversely, pretreatment with carvedilol to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores totally prevented thapsigargin from releasing more Ca2+. U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, abolished histamine (an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Ca2+ mobilizer)-induced, but not carvedilol-induced, [Ca2+]i rise. Pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and forskolin to activate protein kinase C and adenylate cyclase, respectively, did not alter carvedilol-induced [Ca2+]i rise. Separately, overnight treatment with 0.1-30 microM carvedilol inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings suggest that in human MG63 osteosarcoma cells, carvedilol increases [Ca2+]i by stimulating extracellular Ca2+ influx and also by causing intracellular Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and other stores via a phospholipase C-independent manner. Carvedilol may be cytotoxic to osteoblasts.
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is an important cause of hepatocellular injury. Hepatic necrosis may range from asymptomatic elevations in transaminases to fulminant hepatic failure and death. Alverine is an antispasmodic drug which is especially used in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Only a few cases of alverine associated hepatotoxicity have been reported previously. We present the case of a patient with alverine induced hepatotoxicity and cholestasis, which has only seldomly been reported in the literature.
To report a case of dementing syndrome resulting from ibuprofen use.
A 76-year-old white man with normal mental status became confused, was lost in familiar places, and showed short-term memory loss after beginning a therapeutic regimen of ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times daily for osteoarthritis in anticipation of embarking on a foreign trip. Symptoms of dementia began within 1 week after taking ibuprofen and resolved completely within 1 week after the ibuprofen regimen was stopped. This pattern was repeated 6 months later, when the patient again traveled abroad. Consistently before, during, and after these events, the patient took atenolol, clonidine, lisinopril, aspirin, vitamin C, lecithin, vitamin E, and multivitamins.
Using the Naranjo probability scale, we reasoned that the patient's dementia-like syndrome could be attributed to the use of ibuprofen because pseudodementia appeared after the suspected drug was administered, improved when the drug was discontinued, reappeared when the drug was readministered, had no apparent alternative cause, manifested similarly after each exposure to ibuprofen, and was confirmed by the family's observation after both episodes. Objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug reaction was probable.
Use of ibuprofen must be considered during clinical evaluation of any patient with new onset of dementing illness. The Naranjo probability scale may be clinically useful for evaluating other pharmaceutical agents that may be contributing to development of dementia-like conditions.
A 64 year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to our hospital because of general fatigue. She noticed polyarthralgia 8 months prior to the admission and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis was made. Administration of salazosulfapyridine (1.0 g/day) was started 6 months before the admission. Complete remission of rheumatoid arthritis was obtained in 2 months and blood cell counts showed normal values at that time. The results of laboratory tests included hemoglobin; 8.6 g/dl, white blood cell count; 1,900/mm3 with a differential of 19% neutrophils, 77% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes; platelets were 21,000/mm3. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed. There were reduced numbers of myelocytes, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes indicating aplastic anemia. Salazosulfapyridine was discontinued. Prednisolone, anabolic steroid and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were administrated. In spite of these therapy, recovery of peripheral blood cell counts have not been observed and supporting therapy including red cell and platelets transfusion have been continued. To our knowledge, this is the first case report which describes occurrence of aplastic anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated by salazosulfapyridine.
This report describes two patients with recent stroke who, upon transfer to the rehabilitation medicine service, were noted to have extrapyramidal features. Both patients were receiving amiodarone for management of atrial fibrillation. When this medication was discontinued, there was slow resolution of extrapyramidal features and an improvement in function. Physicians managing acute stroke patients should be alert for features of amiodarone neurotoxicity, because these side effects may occur more readily in patients with recent neurologic impairment and may impede their progress in rehabilitation.
To report the development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) associated with the use of high-dose liposomal amphotericin B.
A 38-year-old white man with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia underwent a matched unrelated donor allogeneic bone marrow transplant with adequate engraftment and mild graft-versus-host disease responding to corticosteroids. Approximately 11 months after transplant, the patient was admitted to the hospital with suspected fungal pneumonia and started on liposomal amphotericin B (baseline serum creatinine 1.4-1.5 mg/dL). The dose was increased due to his immunosuppression and poor response, as the fungal etiology was identified as Torulopsis glabrata. The patient required mechanical ventilation due to biopsy-proven bronchiolitis olbiterans organizing pneumonia. Additionally, he developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and received intravenous desmopressin, with a reduction in bloody secretions. He also developed hypernatremia (serum sodium 155 mEq/L) on day 3 of the desmopressin and had an inappropriately increased urine output consistent with NDI. The most likely etiology for the NDI was liposomal amphotericin B and its associated hypokalemia.
The observation of worsening hypernatremia (serum sodium increased from 135 to 164 mEq/L) with polyuria was associated with an increasing cumulative dosage of liposomal amphotericin B for fungal pneumonia despite the concurrent use of intravenous desmopressin. Aggressive water replacement was an effective treatment option in this patient. The Naranjo probability scale classified this as a possible adverse reaction because of the temporal sequence of NDI after high-dose liposomal amphotericin B and previously reported cases of NDI associated with amphotericin B desoxycholate.
Amphotericin B desoxycholate has been implicated as an etiology for NDI, and the use of the newer liposomal amphotericin B reportedly avoids this rare complication. We observed the development of NDI despite the use of liposomal amphotericin B in a critically ill patient with bone marrow transplant.
HIV protease inhibitors (HIV-PIs) are key components of highly active antiretroviral therapy, but they have been associated with adverse side effects, including partial lipodystrophy and metabolic syndrome. We recently demonstrated that a commonly used HIV-PI, lopinavir, inhibits ZMPSTE24, thereby blocking lamin A biogenesis and leading to an accumulation of prelamin A. ZMPSTE24 deficiency in humans causes an accumulation of prelamin A and leads to lipodystrophy and other disease phenotypes. Thus, an accumulation of prelamin A in the setting of HIV-PIs represents a plausible mechanism for some drug side effects. Here we show, with metabolic labeling studies, that lopinavir leads to the accumulation of the farnesylated form of prelamin A. We also tested whether a new and chemically distinct HIV-PI, darunavir, inhibits ZMPSTE24. We found that darunavir does not inhibit the biochemical activity of ZMPSTE24, nor does it lead to an accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A in cells. This property of darunavir is potentially attractive. However, all HIV-PIs, including darunavir, are generally administered with ritonavir, an HIV-PI that is used to block the metabolism of other HIV-PIs. Ritonavir, like lopinavir, inhibits ZMPSTE24 and leads to an accumulation of prelamin A.
To report a patient developing fulminant liver failure while being treated with clarithromycin for pneumonia.
A 58-year-old white woman developed fulminant liver failure while being treated with the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin for pneumonia. Comedication included N-acetylcysteine, atenolol, and isradipine. Other causes of liver failure, such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, toxins, and heart failure, were excluded by appropriate diagnostic means. All drugs were stopped, and the patient was transferred to another hospital for liver transplantation. She recovered spontaneously within several days, making transplantation unnecessary. A liver biopsy obtained 10 days after the initial presentation revealed centroacinar necrosis and beginning fibrous reorganization, compatible with recent centroacinar damage.
Since no other cause could be identified, liver injury was considered to be drug related. Fulminant liver failure has not previously been described with concomitant use of atenolol and N-acetylcysteine. Although isradipine has been associated with hepatocellular injury, there are no reports of fulminant liver failure with this agent, and our patient had been treated for >2 years without signs of toxicity. The most likely cause of liver failure in this patient was, therefore, clarithromycin, which undergoes hepatic metabolism and has been reported to cause fulminant hepatic failure. A second possibility is an interaction between clarithromycin and isradipine, potentially increasing the hepatic toxicity of isradipine.
Clarithromycin may be a cause of fulminant liver failure either alone or by inhibiting the metabolism of other drugs.
The incidence of complications associated with disease and treatment was compared in younger versus elderly patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). One hundred sixty-five patient records were divided according to patient age into two groups ("younger," 41 to 64, and "elderly," > or = 65 years) and reviewed for the incidence of dyskinesias, fluctuations, freezing, psychosis, dementia, depression, and insomnia. Younger patients had a greater incidence of chorea (75.8 percent vs 49.5 percent), dystonia (82.3 percent vs 49.0 percent), fluctuations (90.1 percent vs 68.1 percent), depression (73.2 percent vs 36.8 percent), and insomnia (57.9 percent vs 18.1 percent). There were no significant differences in the incidence of freezing, dementia, or psychosis. At the time of the first adverse event, there was no difference in patient characteristics such as gender, lag time from disease diagnosis to levodopa initiation, disease symptoms at the time of diagnosis, levodopa dose, or concomitant drug use despite the fact that the older group had a longer duration of disease, higher Hoehn and Yahr stage, an older age at onset of PD, and longer duration of levodopa use. Younger patients with PD experience a greater incidence of adverse effects than do elderly PD patients. The spectrum of adverse effects is comparable to those of young-onset (< or = 40 years) patients.
To report a case of nonreversible bilateral sensorineural hearing loss resulting from administration of intrathecal vancomycin.
A 63-year-old white man with newly diagnosed pre-B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia developed Corynebacterium jeikeium meningitis associated with an Ommaya reservoir. The patient was treated with intravenous vancomycin for several days without symptomatic improvement, and intrathecal vancomycin was added to the treatment regimen. Difficulty in the patient's hearing was noted after the first intrathecal dose and he experienced complete hearing loss after the second intrathecal dose. An audiogram was performed and the patient was diagnosed with cranial nerve VIII bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The Ommaya reservoir was removed and the patient was successfully treated with linezolid.
Ototoxicity with intravenous vancomycin has been documented in multiple case reports, but this adverse effect has not been reported with intrathecal vancomycin. Cerebrospinal fluid vancomycin concentrations were not measured in our patient, but there was 1 documented occurrence of supratherapeutic serum vancomycin concentrations. Other drug-related causes of ototoxicity were evaluated and intrathecal vancomycin-induced ototoxicity was considered to be possible according to the Naranjo probability scale.
The strong temporal relationship that was seen in this case suggests the possibility of an association between administration of intrathecal vancomycin and hearing loss. Healthcare providers should consider the potential for this adverse reaction with the intrathecal route of vancomycin administration.
Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, one enzyme isoform responsible for producing prostanoids from arachidonic acid, contributes to colon carcinogenesis. Recently, genetic disruption of COX-1, the other isoform, was shown to decrease the number of intestinal polyps and prostaglandin E(2) levels in intestinal mucosa, like the case with COX-2 gene disruption, in Min mice. We therefore investigated whether a COX-1 selective inhibitor, mofezolac, suppresses intestinal carcinogenesis in rodents. F344 male rats, receiving azoxymethane (AOM, 15 mg/kg body wt) s.c. injections at 5 and 6 weeks of age, were fed a diet containing 600 or 1200 p.p.m. mofezolac for 4 weeks. The number of aberrant crypt foci (ACFs) per rat and the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index of the crypt epithelium were dose-dependently decreased by administration of mofezolac, the value for the former at 1200 p.p.m. being 60% of control value. When Apc gene knockout mice (APC1309 mice) were given 600 or 1200 p.p.m. mofezolac in their diet for 8 weeks, the numbers of intestinal polyps were also dose-dependently decreased, with reduction to 59% of that in the control diet group at the higher dose. Nimesulide, a COX-2 selective inhibitor used as positive control, showed similar suppressive effects on the development of ACFs in AOM-treated rats and polyps in Apc gene knockout mice. The data indicate that both COX-1 and COX-2 can contribute to intestinal tumorigenesis.
Doxyfluridine is a new cytostatic drug of the fluoropyrimidine group, which may prove to have a high antitumor activity with less toxic side effects. Thirteen patients with advanced colorectal cancer were given doxyfluridine 2 g/m2 as a one-hour infusion for five days every three weeks and examined neurologically and neurophysiologically. One patient experienced an acute, reversible cerebellopathy after the second treatment course and developed a progressive generalized encephalopathy during the subsequent third and fourth cycle. The frequency of cerebellopathy may depend on the dosage and type of administration of the drug. Five patients developed a mild, mainly sensory polyneuropathy. High age, weight loss and decreasing general condition seem to be important factors in the development of polyneuropathy during doxyfluridine treatment, and this stresses the importance of optimal nutrition during the treatment period.
Adenosine plays a key role in different protective and adaptive responses to ischemia and has been suggested to induce ischemic preconditioning.
To investigate whether a low-dose adenosine infusion reduces the ischemic burden induced by pharmacological stress without affecting the coronary flow reserve (CFR).
Myocardial ischemia was induced by dobutamine stress test and quantified by tissue Doppler echocardiography in 11 patients with advanced coronary artery disease. CFR was quantified during high-dose adenosine infusion by contrast echocardiography. Before the dobutamine stress test and contrast echocardiography, intravenous low-dose adenosine or placebo was infused over 15 min according to a randomized, double-blind, cross-over protocol. Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) apical images and flow pattern of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) were obtained at baseline, during adenosine/placebo infusion, maximal, and recovery phases.Furthermore, the LV walls were categorized as ischemic or nonischemic according to a predefined ischemic threshold of at least 25% increment in peak systolic velocity (PSV)from baseline to maximal stress. CFR was measured as the ratio of peak/baseline of maximal diastolic velocity in the distal LAD.
PSV increased both during placebo and adenosine infusions from baseline to maximal stress. However, in the ischemic walls, the PSV increased only during adenosine infusion, whereas no differences were observed in the nonischemic walls. There were no differences in blood pressure, heart rate, or regional CFR during placebo or adenosine infusion.
Low-dose adenosine infusion improves regional LV systolic function in the ischemic walls, without any effect on CFR, suggesting that the observed improvement may be because of ischemic preconditioning.
Two patients with imminent gangrene of the extremities caused by ergot-induced arteriospasm underwent mechanical dilatation of the arteries when conventional measures such as anticoagulation, vasodilation, and sympathetic blockade produced no improvement. Dilatation by a balloon-tipped catheter produced an immediate and sustained reversal of the arteriospasm, together with a dramatic relief of symptoms and signs.
