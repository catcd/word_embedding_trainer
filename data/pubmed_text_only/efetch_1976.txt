Increased mortality after stroke is associated with development of brain edema. The aim of the present study was to examine the contribution of endothelial myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation to hypoxia-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. Measurements of trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) were performed to analyse BBB integrity in an in vitro co-culture model (bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells (BEC) and rat astrocytes). Brain fluid content was analysed in rats after stroke induction using a two-vein occlusion model. Dihydroethidium was used to monitor intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in BEC. MLC phosphorylation was detected using immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis. Hypoxia caused a decrease of TEER values by more than 40%, which was prevented by inhibition of the MLC-kinase (ML-7, 10 micromol/L). In addition, ML-7 significantly reduced the brain fluid content in vivo after stroke. The NAD(P)H-oxidase inhibitor apocynin (500 micromol/L) prevented the hypoxia-induced TEER decrease. Hypoxia-dependent ROS generation was completely abolished by apocynin. Furthermore, ML-7 and apocynin blocked hypoxia-dependent phosphorylation of MLC. Our data demonstrate that hypoxia causes a breakdown of the BBB in vitro and in vivo involving ROS and the contractile machinery.
Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in adult female Wistar rats after 8 days of daily subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol (ISO). Regression from hypertrophy was studied following 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 20 days of ISO withdrawal. After 8 days of treatment cardiac mass increased 40%. Following ISO withdrawal, ventricular regression occurred during the first 8 days. After 12-20 days of recovery, a new steady-state heart weight to body weight ratio was established that was 12-13% above the controls. The half-time recovery for heart weight was 3.8 days. Ventricular RNA content was stimulated 76% after 8 days of ISO-induced hypertrophy. During regression RNA content decreased rapidly during the first 8 days with a half-time of 3.4 days. Following 20 days of recovery ventricular RNA was still 31% above the controls. However, myocyte RNA was stimulated 86% following 8 days of ISO treatment and returned to control level after 12 days of regression. Myocardial DNA was increased 23% in the hypertrophied hearts and did not change during the recovery period. Hydroxyproline was increased in the ISO-treated hearts and decreased only slightly during the recovery interval. These data indicate that ISO-induced hypertrophy was reversible while ventricular RNA content only partially recovered. Nevertheless, myocyte RNA showed a large stimulation that was completely reversible at least after 12 days of recovery.
Cleft Lip and Palate Transmembrane Protein 1-Like (CLPTM1L), resides in a region of chromosome 5 for which copy number gain has been found to be the most frequent genetic event in the early stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This locus has been found by multiple genome wide association studies to be associated with lung cancer in both smokers and non-smokers. CLPTM1L has been identified as an overexpressed protein in human ovarian tumor cell lines that are resistant to cisplatin, which is the only insight thus far into the function of CLPTM1L. Here we find CLPTM1L expression to be increased in lung adenocarcinomas compared to matched normal lung tissues and in lung tumor cell lines by mechanisms not exclusive to copy number gain. Upon loss of CLPTM1L accumulation in lung tumor cells, cisplatin and camptothecin induced apoptosis were increased in direct proportion to the level of CLPTM1L knockdown. Bcl-xL accumulation was significantly decreased upon loss of CLPTM1L. Expression of exogenous Bcl-xL abolished sensitization to apoptotic killing with CLPTM1L knockdown. These results demonstrate that CLPTM1L, an overexpressed protein in lung tumor cells, protects from genotoxic stress induced apoptosis through regulation of Bcl-xL. Thus, this study implicates anti-apoptotic CLPTM1L function as a potential mechanism of susceptibility to lung tumorigenesis and resistance to chemotherapy.
Increased platelet serotonin level (PSL) has been consistently found in a portion of autistic patients. Suggested mechanisms for hyperserotonemia in autism have been increased synthesis of serotonin (5HT) by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), increased uptake into platelets through 5HT transporter (5HTt), diminished release from platelets through 5HT2A receptor (5HT2Ar) and decreased metabolism by monoamine oxydase (MAOA). The allelic influence of genes, encoding the mentioned 5HT elements, on PSL was investigated in 63 autistic subjects. Our study shows that 5HTt-LPR and -1438AG 5HT(2Ar) genotypes did not significantly affect PSL. However, significantly higher PSLs were observed in subjects with "cc" genotype of a218c TPH and subjects with "4" genotype of uVNTR MAOA. In addition, when TPH-cc and MAOA-4 were combined as "high 5HT" genotypes, a correlative increase in PSL was observed with the increase in the number of "high 5HT" genotypes. These results suggest a possible synergistic effect of genes regulating 5HT synthesis/degradation in dysregulation of the peripheral 5HT homeostasis of autistic patients.
Transesophageal atrial stimulation was applied in 56 patients to terminate atrial flutter. Extrastimulation and atrial burst techniques were applied using programmable stimulator (Medtronic 5328) and hexapolar esophageal electrode catheters. Thirty patients were randomized to receive digoxin pretreatment (group A), and 26 patients were randomized to receive procainamide pretreatment (group B). Efficacy of each pretreatment was evaluated by observing the change in the rhythm. In group A, transesophageal pacemaker therapy successfully converted atrial flutter to sinus rhythm in 13 patients and to atrial fibrillation in 14 patients, whereas the arrhythmia remained unchanged in the 3 remaining patients in the digitalized group. In group B, after procainamide pretreatment, sinus rhythm appeared in 19 and atrial fibrillation in 5, and no change was observed in the remaining 2 patients. Procainamide is more efficacious than digoxin (P < 0.05) in facilitating cardioversion by transesophageal stimulation.
Skeletal muscle wasting is a prominent feature of cancer cachexia and involves decreased muscle protein synthesis and increased activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of protein degradation. We report that both indomethacin and ibuprofen improved body weight and weight of the gastrocnemius muscle in tumor-bearing mice. Ibuprofen increased the soluble protein content of the muscle without affecting muscle levels of phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase, a ribosomal kinase involved in protein synthesis. Paradoxically, indomethacin increased levels of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Further study is needed to understand the mechanism of action by which indomethacin and ibuprofen preserve body weight and muscle mass in the tumor-bearing mice. The data suggest that ibuprofen may have beneficial effects in the treatment of cancer cachexia.
The calcium blocking agent nifedipine was shown to protect the isolated left ventricle against the development of altered diastolic compliance during severe global ischemia. To assess the influence of nifedipine during myocardial ischemia in human subjects, we studied the effect of nifedipine (20 mg sublingually) on the hemodynamic response to pacing tachycardia (heart rate 66 +/- 4 to 143 +/- 4 beats per minute) in 17 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Typical anginal pain occurred in all patients during pacing tachycardia before nifedipine, but in only 3 of 17 patients during pacing after nifedipine. In 11 patients a significant (greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg) increase in postpacing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP, 15 +/- 2 mm Hg to 28 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) developed, and was associated with an upward shift of the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume curve. In these patients, pretreatment with nifedipine did not alter resting LVEDP or aortic pressure, but did attenuate or abolish the increase n LVEDP and the shift in left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume curves after pacing tachycardia to the same rate and for the same duration. The antianginal effect of nifedipine was not associated with a reduction in contractility, because there was no change in LV + dp/dt after nifedipine. However, the increase in left ventricular systolic pressure achieved in response to pacing tachycardia was less after nifedipine. We conclude that nifedipine favorably modifies the symptomatic and hemodynamic response to pacing tachycardia in patients with coronary artery disease. The mechanism is uncertain and could involve a direct myocardial effect, peripheral vasodilation, coronary vasodilation or a combination of these effects.
A 61 year old female developed fatal hepatic failure after phenytoin administration. A typical multisystem clinical pattern precedes the manifestations of hepatic injury. The hematologic, biochemical and pathologic features indicate a mixed hepatocellular damage due to drug hypersensitivity. In a patient receiving phenytoin who presents a viral-like illness, early recognition and discontinuation of the drug are mandatory.
Necrosis and apoptosis coexist in the thyroid during goitre development and involution, but little is known about their respective causes. To test the possible role of free radicals, we analysed separately necrosis and apoptosis in male Wistar rats with depressed or normal antioxidant protection. Vitamin E-deficient and -sufficient rats were made goitrous with perchlorate in drinking water; involution was induced by repeated injection of NaI, without or with methimazole. Increase of thyroid malondialdehyde concentration and decrease of glutathione peroxidase activity confirmed the depressed antioxidant protection in vitamin E-deficient rats. Plasma thyroxine and TSH levels were not modified. Necrosis (swollen cells) and apoptosis (pyknotic cells) were quantified on histological sections. In vitamin E-sufficient rats, dead cells were very rare in control thyroids, increased 3-fold in goitre and still further during involution. Necrotic epithelial cells predominated in the goitre and their number declined after iodide supplementation, without or with methimazole. In contrast, the number of apoptotic cells and the caspase-3 activity were increased in goitre and further increased after involution, with two-thirds of pyknotic cells being observed in the interstitium. Apoptosis was prevented by methimazole. Vitamin E deficiency significantly increased total cell death and epithelial cell necrosis and induced the occurrence of much cell debris in the follicular lumen during involution, with no modification of the apoptotic reaction. These results show that the type of cell death is differentially regulated during goitre development and involution: necrosis is related to the oxidative status of the cells, while apoptosis comes with iodine-induced involution.
Topical use of clindamycin has been associated with taste disorders in the literature, but little is known about the nature of this adverse drug reaction. The aim of this article was to describe reports of clindamycin-induced taste disorders and to analyse the factors involved.
The adverse drug reaction database of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre was searched for reports concerning taste disorders with antibiotics. Clinical review of the cases and statistical analysis with logistic regression were performed. Characteristics of patients who reported taste disorders were compared for age, gender and formulation in clindamycin vs. other antibiotic users.
Taste disorders were reported in seven (18%) of the clindamycin cases. In five reports an oral formulation was involved, in one report intravenous (i.v.) administration and in one report both formulations were used. Latency was <1 day after start and in one case taste disorders were present repeatedly at 10 min after every i.v. application. The adjusted reporting odds ratio was 7.0 (95% confidence interval 2.8, 17.3) and supports a possible causal relationship.
The association of clindamycin and taste disorders is supported by disproportionality analysis and seems to be independent of possible confounders such as age, gender and infections. The case reports suggest a role for clindamycin concentrations excreted in body fluids like saliva.
We analyzed the influence of temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure on the 1-year incidence of nephrolithiasis among human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected patients treated with indinavir. One hundred three patients (13.6%) developed 326 episodes of nephrolithiasis. Eighty-two patients (79.6%) had more than one episode (range, two to seven episodes). The overall incidence ranged from 0 to 10.2 episodes per 100 patients exposed per month. There was a significant correlation between temperature and the overall incidence of nephrolithiasis and the incidence of recurrences but not with the incidence of first episodes. Nephrolithiasis was not related to humidity or atmospheric pressure. Our data support the standard recommendation of drinking at least 1.5 L of water daily to prevent nephrolithiasis in most patients treated with indinavir irrespective of meteorologic factors. However, the risk of nephrolithiasis is higher for a certain subgroup of patients when the environment is hot irrespective of adequate water intake.
Hyperactivity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may be one of the factors in the maintenance of postamputation stump pain.
Ketamine-a clinical available NMDA receptor antagonist-was administered intravenously to a patient with established stump pain in a double-blind saline-controlled fashion. Following infusion stump pain was alleviated for 31 hours. Ketamine reduced the allodynic area and wind-up-like pain and increased pressure-pain thresholds. Treatment was started with ketamine 50 mg x 4 per day dissolved in juice. No side effects or development of tolerance were observed during a 3-month treatment period.
NMDA receptor antagonists may have a potential in the treatment of neuropathic pain, including stump pain.
Tubular obstruction in acute renal failure, postulated to cause the restricted excretory function, is suggested by raising intratubular pressure, to lower effective filtration pressure and diminish urine output. To examine the applicability of the obstruction hypothesis to the pathogenesis of experimental acute renal failure, proximal intratubular pressure and renal function were measured after renal insults of different origins and severity. Obstruction in acute renal failure kidneys should manifest itself as an increase in intratubular pressure for a least 12 h, for within this time period following ureteral occlusion, elevated pressures were found to reflect obstruction. The consistent existence of raised proximal intratubular pressure in acute renal failure kidneys could not be detected; ischaemic and nephrototoxic models were found in which no rise in intratubular pressure could be demonstrated. The oliguric nature of acute renal failure kidneys could not be verified; ischaemic and nephrotoxic models were found in which urine output was either normal or enhanced. Only for methaemoglobin induced renal failure were raised intratubular pressure, oliguria and casts concurrent. It is concluded that obstruction is not a consistent feature of experimental acute renal failure and that the obstruction hypothesis may be specifically applicable to only a few models, which include haeme pigment and folic acid induced renal failure.
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a progressive interstitial lung disease that affects young women. It has been suggested that estrogens play a role in its evolution, and progesterone therapy is often provided in these cases.
We present a case of a postmenopausal woman with LAM treated with progesterone; subsequently, rapid growth of multiple intracranial meningiomas was observed. One prominent lesion was excised, and 3 other lesions regressed spontaneously over 2 years.
This is a rare case of a non-pregnancy-related regression of meningiomas in a woman affected by LAM. The significance of this association and the hormonal treatment of the disease are discussed.
Adenocarcinoma of the rete testis is an exceptionally rare and malignant testicular neoplasm. Although treatment of pregnant women with diethylstilbestrol (DES) results in reproductive tract abnormalities in their male offspring, increased incidence of testicular tumors has not been verified. However, recently three cases of seminoma have been described in men prenatally exposed to DES, suggesting an association of prenatal DES treatment and the subsequent development of testicular tumors. This report describes the treatment of outbred pregnant CD-1 mice with DES (100 micrograms/kg) on Days 9 through 16 of gestation and its effects on their male offspring. In addition to nonmalignant abnormalities such as retained testes which have been reported in men exposed prenatally to DES, lesions resembling adenocarcinoma of the rete testis were seen in prenatally DES-treated mice at 10 to 18 mo of age (11 of 233; 5%). No comparable lesions were seen in 96 age-matched control male mice. These results suggest an association of prenatal DES exposure and the subsequent development of testicular lesions in the rete testis of mice.
From January 1981 to June 1986 116 patients with anticoagulation-related intracranial haemorrhage were referred to hospital. Seventy six of these haemorrhages were extracerebral, 69 were in the subdural and seven in the subarachnoid space. No epidural haemorrhages were identified. Compared with non-anticoagulation-related haematomas, the risk of haemorrhage was calculated to be increased fourfold in men and thirteenfold in women. An acute subdural haematoma, mostly due to contusion, was more frequently accompanied by an additional intracerebral haematoma than a chronic subdural haematoma. Trauma was a more important factor in acute subdural haematomas than in chronic. Almost half of the patients (48%) had a history of hypertension, more than a third (35%) had heart disease and about one fifth (18%) were diabetic. Headache was the most frequent initial symptom. Later decreased level of consciousness and focal neurological signs exceeded the frequency of headache. Three patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and nine patients with acute subdural haematomas died, while those with chronic subdural haematomas all survived and had at the most mild, non-disabling sequelae. Myocardial infarction (22%), pulmonary embolism (20%), and arterial disease (20%) were the most frequent reasons for anticoagulant treatment. Critical review based on established criteria for anticoagulation treatment suggests there was no medical reason to treat a third of these patients. The single most useful measure that could be taken to reduce the risk of anticoagulation-induced intracranial haemorrhage would be to identify patients who are being unnecessarily treated and to discontinue anticoagulants.
Inhalation of ambient air particulate matter (PM) is associated with pulmonary injury and inflammation. Using primary cultures of guinea pig tracheal epithelial (GPTE) cells as an in vitro model of airway epithelium, we examined effects of exposure to suspensions of six different emission and ambient air PM samples: residual oil fly ash (ROFA) from an electrical power plant; fly ash from a domestic oil burning furnace (DOFA); ambient air dust from St. Louis (STL), Ottawa (OT), and Washington, DC (WDC); and volcanic ash from the eruption of Mount Saint Helens (MSH) in 1980. Effects of these particulates on cell viability (assessed via LDH assay), secretion of mucin (measured by a monoclonal antibody-based ELISA), and steady-state mRNA levels of the mucin gene MUC2 were determined. ROFA was the most toxic of the dusts tested, as it significantly increased LDH release following a 24-h incubation with 50 microg/cm(2) ROFA. ROFA also enhanced MUC2 mRNA after 4-h exposure, and mucin secretion after 8 h. ROFA-induced mucin secretion and cytotoxicity were attenuated by the oxidant scavenger, dimethylthiourea (DMTU). ROFA exposure also depleted cells of glutathione (GSH). Relatedly, depletion of intracellular GSH by treatment of the cells with buthionine sulfoxamine (BSO) also provoked mucin secretion, as well as enhancing the secretory effect of ROFA when the two agents were added together. L-NMA, the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, did not affect ROFA-induced mucin secretion. Of the soluble transition metals in ROFA (nickel, iron, vanadium), only vanadium individually, or combinations of the metals containing vanadium, provoked secretion. The results suggest ROFA enhances mucin secretion and generates toxicity in vitro to airway epithelium via a mechanism(s) involving generation of oxidant stress, perhaps related to depletion of cellular antioxidant capacity. Deleterious effects of inhalation of ROFA in the respiratory tract in vivo may relate to these cellular responses. Vanadium, a component of ROFA, may be important in generating these reactions.
One hundred and thirty-one post-liver transplantation patients with chronic hepatitis B and failing lamivudine therapy with detectable serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid by hybridization assays or > or =1 x 10(6) copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction, and elevated alanine transaminase levels despite continuous lamivudine, were enrolled in an open-label study of adefovir dipivoxil. The B and C domains of HBV polymerase were sequenced for baseline samples to determine the presence of lamivudine resistance mutations. The results showed that 98% of the samples had tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) mutations, indicating a strong correlation between the above clinical definition of lamivudine treatment failure and the presence of YMDD mutations. In addition to the rtM204V/I and the rtL180M mutations, the mutation rtV173L was identified in 19% of patients. Four major patterns of lamivudine-resistant HBV were identified: rtL180M + rtM204V (60%), rtV173L + rtL180M + rtM204V (19%), rtM204I (9%) and rtL180M + rtM204I (9%). Treatment with adefovir dipivoxil showed similar antiviral efficacy in patients with lamivudine-resistant virus from all four patterns.
Amsler field testing of patients treated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is simple, rapid, reproducible and sensitive. Amsler testing will readily detect small relative paracentral scotomas. Four cases of irreversible bilateral scotomas were detected in 8 eyes of 4 patients with normal static and kinetic fields in 7 of the 8 eyes. Kinetic and static fields on a subsequent examination demonstrated the bilateral paracentral scotomas first detected with the Amsler grid.
Tamoxifen citrate has recently been shown to be effective palliative therapy in advanced endometrial carcinoma. Flare reactions from tamoxifen are well known in treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma and are not an indication for stopping therapy. We report a patient being treated with tamoxifen for advanced endometrial cancer who developed acute abdominal pain as a manifestation of a flare reaction and the significance of this observation.
Transient subacute encephalopathy was detected in 4 of 83 patients undergoing treatment with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and citrovorum factor rescue for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma from 1984 to 1991. Subacute encephalopathy occurred in relatively older patients and early in the course of treatment with HD-MTX. The average interval between the HD-MTX course and the onset of the neurologic disturbance was 6.5 days. All 4 patients treated had no neurological sequelae. Laboratory evaluations disclosed nontoxic plasma MTX levels at onset of symptom and not detected in liquor. CT in 4 patients disclosed no abnormality, but MR images revealed abnormal signal intensity patterns of cerebral white matter in 2 cases. In one case the abnormal MR finding resolved after 3 months. The pathogenesis of this neurologic symptom remains unknown, but further HD-MTX treatment may be acceptable in follow-up of MR image, because the prognosis of subacute encephalopathy seems favorable.
Benzene is a potent bone marrow toxin in animals and man. Animal studies have shown that exposure to benzene can alter T lymphocyte functions and decrease the resistance of animals to Listeria monocytogenes and transplanted tumor cells. Mononuclear phagocytes participate in host resistance to Listeria and tumor cells. The purpose of the studies presented here was to determine the effects of benzene and benzene metabolites on macrophage functions and the ability of macrophages to be activated for functions which are important in host defense. Benzene had no effects on macrophage function or activation for any of the functions tested. Conversely, metabolites of benzene, catechol (CAT), hydroquinone (HQ), benzquinone (BQ), and 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT) had potent and varied effects on macrophage function and activation. BQ inhibited the broadest range of functions including release of H2O2, Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, interferon gamma priming for tumor cell cytolysis, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggering of cytolysis. BQ was also the most potent metabolite causing inhibition at lower concentrations than the other metabolites. HQ inhibited H2O2 release and priming for cytolysis and BT inhibited phagocytosis and priming for cytolysis. CAT only inhibited the release of H2O2. None of the compounds tested inhibited the induction of class II histocompatibility antigens on the cell surface. All of the effects measured occurred using concentrations of compounds which did not disrupt the cell integrity or inhibit general functions such as protein synthesis. Taken together these data suggest that benzene metabolites alter macrophage function through several mechanisms including inhibition of output enzymes and disruption of signal transduction systems.
Finasteride is known to improve urinary symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, but the extent to which the benefit is sustained and whether finasteride reduces the incidence of related events, including the need for surgery and the development of acute urinary retention, is not known.
In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we studied 3040 men with moderate-to-severe urinary symptoms and enlarged prostate glands who were treated daily with 5 mg of finasteride or placebo for four years. Symptom scores (on a scale of 1 to 34), urinary flow rates, and the occurrence of outcome events were assessed every four months in 3016 men. Prostate volume was measured in a subgroup of the men. Complete data on outcomes were available for 2760 men.
During the four-year study period, 152 of the 1503 men in the placebo group (10 percent) and 69 of the 1513 men in the finasteride group (5 percent) underwent surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (reduction in risk with finasteride, 55 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 41 to 65 percent). Acute urinary retention developed in 99 men (7 percent) in the placebo group and 42 men (3 percent) in the finasteride group (reduction in risk with finasteride, 57 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 40 to 69 percent). Among the men who completed the study, the mean decreases in the symptom score were 3.3 in the finasteride group and 1.3 in the placebo group (P<0.001). Treatment with finasteride also significantly improved urinary flow rates and reduced prostate volume (P<0.001).
Among men with symptoms of urinary obstruction and prostatic enlargement, treatment with finasteride for four years reduces symptoms and prostate volume, increases the urinary flow rate, and reduces the risk of surgery and acute urinary retention.
Interferon (IFN)-based regimens for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have become increasingly effective and are able to eradicate virus in more than one half of treated individuals. Treatment strategies are complex and involve self-administration of injectable IFN and oral ribavirin medication, frequent office visits, and laboratory testing. Current therapies have significant side effects that may impair performance and quality of life (QOL), necessitating dose reductions or interruption of therapy. As a consequence of these dose reductions or treatment interruptions, patients may not achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR). Recent data suggest that aggressive management of side effects may improve QOL and therefore patient adherence to therapy. Use of antidepressant and anxiolytic medications and off-label use of hemopoietic stem cell growth factors are increasing in the daily management of HCV therapy. Although these therapies may improve QOL, prevent dose reductions, and increase the number of patients completing therapy, there are no data available to definitively show that such tactics are associated with improvement in SVR rates in individual patients.
