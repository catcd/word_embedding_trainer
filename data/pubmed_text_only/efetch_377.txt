Risperidone is metabolized by polymorphic enzymes, and a large variability in plasma concentration and therapeutic response is observed. Risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI) avoids the first-pass effect, and little is known about the influence of gene polymorphisms involved in its pharmacokinetics. The influence on plasma concentrations of risperidone (RIS), its metabolite 9-hydroxy-risperidone, and on adverse effects were investigated for polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) (*3, *4, *5, *6), CYP3A (CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A4 rs4646437, CYP3A5*3, CYP3A7*1C), ABCB1 (1236C>T, 2677G>T, 3435C>T), NR1/2 coding for pregnane X receptor (rs1523130, rs2472677, rs7643645), and for CYP3A activity measured by a phenotyping test. Forty-two patients with at least 4 consecutive unchanged doses of RLAI were included in a multicenter cross-sectional study. A 55% lower dose-adjusted plasma levels of RIS were observed for CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers (n = 5) as compared with CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers (P < 0.007). NR1/2 polymorphism (rs7643645A>G) influenced RIS exposure with a 2.8-fold lower active moiety (P = 0.031) in GG compared with the AA genotype. This was confirmed in a second independent cohort (n = 16). Furthermore, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was positively correlated with CYP3A activity (P = 0.01), and the NR1/2 (rs2472677) polymorphism was associated with different adverse effects including prolactin plasma levels adjusted for age and sex. In conclusion, our results confirmed the influence of CYP2D6 genotype on plasma levels of RIS. This is the first report on the influence of NR1/2 polymorphisms on RLAI exposure and on drug-induced adverse effects. These results should be validated in larger cohorts.
To investigate the effect of Bushen Yanggan Recipe (BSYGR) on the function and morphology of nigrostriatal system in Parkinsonian model rats with long-term levodopa treatment.
Unilateral Parkinsonian rat models were established by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and ventral segmental area (VTA). Animals were randomly divided into four groups, the sham control group, model control group, levodopa group and levodopa plus BSYGR group. The content of striatal dopa (DA), digydroxy-phenyl acetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanilic acid (HVA) or the THmRNA expression level in the midbrain were measured.
(1) Levels of striatal DA, DOPAC, HVA, DOPAC/DA, HVA/DA decreased in the model control group by about 90% as compared with those in sham control group (P < 0.05). These parameters in the levodopa group were higher than those in the sham control group, while in the levodopa plus BSYGR group, they were lower than those in the levodopa group (P < 0.01), approaching the levels in the sham control group (P > 0.05). (2) Striatal TH activity in the model group was lower than that in the sham control group significantly, but higher than that in the levodopa group, while in the levodopa plus BSYGR group, it showed a level obviously higher than that in the levodopa group (P < 0.05). (3) Levodopa plus BSYGR group had a higher midbrain THmRNA expression level than that in the levodopa group.
BSYGR could effectively reduce the side effects resulting from the long-term treatment of levodopa.
Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) is synthesized in the liver and regulates the mitogenic effects of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). The evidence that IGFBP-1 plays a role in hepatocarcinogenesis, however, is equivocal. We have, therefore, investigated the development of preneoplastic hepatic lesions in transgenic mice in which the human IGFBP-1 gene is under the control of the mouse metallothionein promoter. The lesions were induced by treating 15-d-old male mice with a single intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg diethylnitrosamine (DENA). Lesions were scored when the mice were 28 wk of age. Quantitative microscopy of liver sections revealed that significantly fewer transgenic mice treated with zinc to activate the transgene had focal lesions compared to either transgenic mice not treated with zinc or wild-type mice treated with zinc (36.4% versus 85.7% and 83.3%, respectively, P < 0.05 in each case). Zinc-treated transgenic mice also had significantly fewer lesions per liver (11.5 +/- 5.0 versus 74.7 +/- 18.4 and 59.4 +/- 15.6, respectively, P < 0.01 in each case) and a smaller percentage of liver volume occupied by lesions (0.2 +/- 0.1 versus 1.4 +/- 0.3 and 1.1 +/- 0.4 respectively, P < 0.05 in each case). Immunohistochemical staining showed that both IGF-I and IGF-II were overexpressed in most of the lesions. These results show that expression of the IGFBP-1 transgene leads to a marked inhibition of hepatic preneoplasia, possibly by decreasing the mitogenic activity of IGF-I and/or IGF-II. This study adds new evidence to the notion that the IGF axis plays an important role in liver cancer development.
A case is presented in which ureteritis cystica developed following formalin instillation for treatment of cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. It is not known whether this complication, not previously reported, is a result of the cyclophosphamide, the formalin, or a combination of both. Patients being considered for formalin instillation should be studied by cystography for evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux. Alternative methods to formalin instillation should be considered in patients with reflux.
To investigate the potential clinical benefit of a combination therapy.
205 patients fulfilling the ACR criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), not treated with disease modifying antirheumatoid drugs previously, with an early (< or = 1 year duration), active (Disease Activity Score (DAS) > 3.0), rheumatoid factor and/or HLA DR 1/4 positive disease were randomised between sulphasalazine (SASP) 2000 (maximum 3000) mg daily (n = 68), or methotrexate (MTX) 7.5 (maximum 15) mg weekly (n = 69) or the combination (SASP + MTX) of both (n = 68).
The mean changes in the DAS during the one year follow up of the study was -1.15, -0.87, -1.26 in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX group respectively (p = 0.019). However, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of either EULAR good responders 34%, 38%, 38% or ACR criteria responders 59%, 59%, 65% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX group respectively. Radiological progression evaluated by the modified Sharp score was very modest in the three groups: mean changes in erosion score: +2.4, +2.4, +1.9, in narrowing score: +2.3, +2.1, +1.6 and in total damage score: +4.6, +4.5, +3.5, in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX groups respectively. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the SASP + MTX group 91% versus 75% in the SASP and MTX group (p = 0.025). Nausea was the most frequent side effect: 32%, 23%, 49% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX groups respectively (p = 0.007).
This study suggests that an early initiation therapy of disease modifying drug seems to be of benefit. However, this study was unable to demonstrate a clinically relevant superiority of the combination therapy although several outcomes were in favour of this observation. The tolerability of the three treatment modalities seems acceptable.
We examined the effects of exogenous melatonin and the time of its administration on core body temperature (CBT) and heart rate (HR) in cynomolgus monkeys. Doses of melatonin at 0.2, 2, 20 and 200 mg/kg were administered by oral gavage once daily at different times. With administration at 09.00 h, melatonin dose-dependently suppressed CBT and the effect reached statistical significance at 200 mg/kg. With administration at 16.00 h, the suppressive effect on CBT was not evident for several hours after administration possibly due to masking by the normal robust CBT decline. Unexpectedly, melatonin inhibited the normal CBT decline thereafter and this resulted in an upward shift of the CBT nadir during the dark phase especially with 200 mg/kg. The HR showed a similar upward shift at that time. Any effects on the CBT and HR from melatonin administration were not inhibited by luzindole, an MT(1)/MT(2) receptor antagonist, whereas N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, a ligand of the MT(3) binding site, mimicked all the actions of melatonin. To our knowledge, this is the first time it has been shown that melatonin administered in the early evening promotes upward shifting of the CBT and HR in the nighttime in addition to the daytime decrease in the CBT. These changes may be mediated, at least partly, through the MT(3) binding site.
Chronic exposure of humans to benzene (BZ) causes acute myelogenous leukemia. These studies determined whether BZ, or its reactive metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ), affect differentiation of myeloblasts. BZ or HQ administered to C57BL/6J mice specifically induced terminal granulocytic differentiation of myeloblasts. The ability of the compounds to induce differentiation of the myeloblast was tested directly using the murine interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloblastic cell line, 32D.3 (G) and the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cell line. Treatment of HL-60 myeloblasts with BZ activated protein kinase C and upregulated the 5-lipoxygenase (LPO) pathway for the production of leukotriene D4 (LTD4), an essential effector of granulocytic differentiation. Differentiation was prevented by sphinganine, a kinase C inhibitor, as well as by LPO inhibitors and LTD4 receptor antagonists. BZ and HQ also induced differentiation in 32D.3 (G) myeloblasts. Both compounds interact with cellular signaling pathways activated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and thus replace the requirement for G-CSF. IL-3 induces a growth response, whereas G-CSF provides both growth and differentiation signals. BZ does not induce growth in the absence of IL-3, but provides a differentiation signal. Both HQ and LTD4 induce differentiation and synergize with IL-3 for growth, however, neither support growth in the absence of IL-3. BZ-induced 32D cells showed a gradual progression of progenitor differentiation to granulocytes similar to that seen with G-CSF or LTD4. HQ blocks differentiation at the myelocyte stage; only a small percentage of progenitors proceed to granulocytes. BZ, like G-CSF, upregulates LTD4 production, whereas HQ obviates the requirement for LTD4 by activating the LTD4 receptor.
The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) contain a major circadian pacemaker, which is regulated by photic and nonphotic stimuli. Although enkephalins are present in the SCN, their role in phase regulation of the pacemaker is largely unknown. The opioid agonist fentanyl, a homologue of morphine, is an addictive drug that induces phase shifts of circadian rhythms in hamsters. We observed that these phase shifts are blocked by naloxone, which is a critical test for true opioid receptor involvement, and conclude that opioid receptors are the sole mediators of the actions of fentanyl on the circadian timing system. A strong interaction between opioids and light input was shown by the ability of fentanyl and light to completely block each other's phase shifts of behavioural activity rhythms. Neuronal ensemble recordings in vitro provide first evidence that SCN cells show direct responses to fentanyl and react with a suppression of firing rate. Moreover, we show that fentanyl induces a strong attenuation of light-induced Syrian hamster Period 1 (shPer1) gene expression during the night. During the subjective day, we found no evidence for a role of shPer1 in mediation of fentanyl-induced phase shifts. Based on the present results, however, we cannot exclude the involvement of shPer2. Our data indicate that opioids can strongly modify the photic responsiveness of the circadian pacemaker and may do so via direct effects on SCN electrical activity and regulation of Per genes. This suggests that the pathways regulating addictive behaviour and the circadian clock intersect.
Tamoxifen has been a very effective treatment for breast cancer for several decades, however, at the same time increases the risk of endometrial cancer, especially after prolonged exposure. In addition, tamoxifen has been associated with a higher proportion of unfavorable uterine tumor subtypes (carcinosarcomas and serous adenocarcinomas) with worse survival. We investigated whether endometrial tumors, which developed after prolonged tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer, are genetically different from endometrial tumors without preceding tamoxifen exposure. Array CGH was used on archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded endometrial tumors to determine genomic aberrations. We compared the genomic profiles of 52 endometrial tumors from breast cancer patients after long-term (>or=2 years) tamoxifen use (endometrioid adenocarcinomas, n = 26; carcinosarcomas, n = 14; and serous adenocarcinomas, n = 12) with endometrial tumors from unexposed breast cancer patients (n = 45). Genomic profiles were correlated with tamoxifen exposure, tumor subtypes, and histopathological characteristics of the endometrial tumors. The common uterine corpus cancers of the endometrioid subtype show few genomic aberrations. Tumors with many genomic aberrations were in general ER-negative. In contrast, carcinosarcomas and serous adenocarcinomas showed many aberrations; however, they were indistinguishable from each other. Tumors that developed after prolonged tamoxifen use did not show more or different aberrations than unexposed tumors. This was true for all tumor subtypes. Thus, endometrial carcinomas that develop after prolonged tamoxifen use cannot be distinguished from nonusers on basis of their tumor genomic profile.
EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1) was recently described as an antagonist of angiogenesis. Motivated by a strong dependence of tumor growth and metastasis on angiogenesis, we investigated the role of EFEMP1 in human breast cancer. We applied RNA microarray expression analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (QRT) in a total of 45 sporadic breast cancer tissues and found EFEMP1 down-regulation in 59% and 61% of the analyzed tissues, respectively. This down-regulation was confirmed on protein level. Immunohistochemistry in 211 breast cancer tissues resulted in reduced or even abolished EFEMP1 expression in 57-62.5% of the tumors. Bisulphite genomic sequencing in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancer tissues revealed promoter methylation as the major cause of this down-regulation. Furthermore, analysis of 203 clinically well characterized primary breast cancers displayed a significant correlation of reduced EFEMP1 protein expression with poor disease-free (p = 0.037) and overall survival (p = 0.032), particularly in those node-positive patients who received adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy, but not in those treated by either cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil (CMF) or Tamoxifen. In summary, the presented data demonstrate for the first time the reduced EFEMP1 expression on RNA and protein level in a substantial number of sporadic breast carcinomas and its correlation with epigenetic alterations. Furthermore, these data point towards a possible predictive impact of EFEMP1 expression in primary breast cancer.
Melatonin is a hormone responsible for the regulation of circadian and seasonal rhythms. This hormone is synthesised in many tissues in the body including the eye, where it regulates important processes. During the recent years, the role of melatonin in the control of IOP has been investigated and it has been demonstrated that melatonin receptors are present and involved in the dynamics of the aqueous humour. 5-Methoxycarbonylamino-N-acetyltryptamine (5-MCA-NAT) is a selective MT3 melatonin receptor agonist. Topical application of this product produces a clear reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) in New Zealand white rabbits and in glaucomatous monkeys. In this work, the potent ocular hypotensive 5-MCA-NAT has been dissolved in excipients used in currently marketed drug formulations. Until now, this melatonin analogue had been dissolved in either DMSO or ethanol neither of which is suitable for ocular topical application in humans. Solubility assays in the different solvents were performed by the observation of the presence of drug crystals under optical microscopy. 5-MCA-NAT was completely dissolved in propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300) within 24h. Ophthalmic formulations were prepared from different ratios of PG:PBS and the commercialized Systane product. Quantification of 5-MCA-NAT in the vehicles was assessed by HPLC. In vitro cytotoxicity of the formulations was evaluated by the MTT method and in vivo tolerance of 5-MCA-NAT in the solvents was analyzed by biomicroscopy and specular microscopy. Systane and proportions of PG:PBS up to 10% of PG did not show cytotoxicity in human corneal limbal epithelial cells (HCLE). In vivo experiments showed that the higher the ocular tolerance, the less amount of PG present. The ocular hypotensive effect of 5-MCA-NAT dissolved in the new formulations was checked measuring IOP for 8h after instillation of the substance. The best effect lowering IOP was obtained with 5-MCA-NAT dissolved in PG and diluted with PBS (PG 1.43%) in which 5-MCA-NAT produced a reduction of 28.11+/-2.0% and the effect lasted about 7h. In conclusion, new formulations accepted for ocular topical treatments different from DMSO or ethanol were capable of dissolving the melatonin analogue 5-MCA-NAT, preserving its ocular hypotensive ability. Therefore, the use of 5-MCA-NAT may be possible in the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma.
Gamma-tocopherol (gamma-T) alone or in combination with alpha-tocopherol has been shown to suppress biomarkers of oxidative stress in asthamatics and human subjects with metabolic syndrome. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a key event in prostate carcinogenesis. Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of gamma-tocopherol-enriched mixed tocopherol diet on prostate carcinogenesis in a murine prostate cancer model (TRAMP). 8 week old TRAMP males were fed 0.1% gamma-T-enriched mixed tocopherol diet that contained 20-fold higher levels of gamma-tocopherol, and roughly 3-fold higher levels of alpha-tocopherol. The effect of such diet on tumor and PIN development was observed. The expression of phase II detoxifying, antioxidant enzymes and Nrf2 mRNA and protein were determined by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques. Treatment with gamma-T-enriched mixed tocopherols significantly suppressed the incidence of palpable tumor and Prostate Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN) development without affecting the expression of the transgene (SV-40). Tumor progression occurred with a significant suppression of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, heme-oxygenase-1 and phase II detoxifying enzymes. Treatment with gamma-T-enriched mixed tocopherol diet upregulated the expression of most detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. Nrf2-a redox sensitive transcription factor known to mediate the expression of phase II detoxifying enzymes, was also significantly upregulated following treatment with gamma-T-enriched mixed tocopherol diet. Gamma-T-enriched mixed tocopherols significantly up-regulated the expression of Nrf2 and its related detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes thereby suppressing PIN and tumor development.
Recently, we identified a subgroup of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) with a clinical relevant food intolerance proven by double blind placebo controlled challenge. In search of possible pathomechanisms involved in this food intolerance, which leads to aggravation of the disease, the aim of the present study was to determine sulfidoleukotriene production in these patients using isolated leucocytes from the peripheral blood after stimulation with different food additives. Leukotriene production of peripheral leucocytes was detected by incubation of isolated cells with the food additives at different concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 200 microg/mL after pre-stimulation with IL-3. Ten non-atopic donors (A), nine AD patients of the diet responder group with negative oral provocation test against food additives (B) and nine patients of the responder group with positive reactions after the oral provocation test (C) were investigated. In the non-atopic group (A), no increased sulfidoleukotriene (sLT) release was observed for all food additives tested. In group B, increased sLT production was determined using tartrazine in one patient (1/9) and using nitrite in two patients (2/9), whereas sLT production remained below the cut-off range in all patients of group B (9/9) using benzoate, metabisulfite and salicylate. By contrast, in group C increased sLT production was observed with food colour mix in 1/9, with tartrazine in 3/9, with benzoate in 4/9, with nitrite in 5/9, with salicylate in 2/9 and with metabisulfite in 1/9. However, no increased sLT concentration was determined in the presence of the tested food additives in two patients of group C. Increased sLT production by peripheral leucocytes in the presence of single food additives was observed in the majority of patients with a proven food intolerance towards food additives proven by double-blind-placebo-controlled challenges. These food additives were particulary tartrazine, benzoate and nitrite. These findings indicate that single food additives as aggravating factors in AD patients may trigger the disease through increased sLT production as a pathophysiological mechanism.
We previously reported the occurrence of QT prolongation and sudden death owing to torsades de pointes (TdP) in dogs treated with D0870, an antifungal agent. In the present study, we evaluated the influences of epinephrine and isoproterenol on the onset of TdP each time D0870 was given to 6 anesthetized open-chest dogs at a dosage of 20 mg/kg, 5 times every 40 minutes, by the simultaneous measurements of surface electrocardiogram and epicardial monophasic action potential (MAP). D0870 alone induced noticeable prolongation of the QT interval and action potential duration (APD), but neither ventricular premature contraction (VPC) nor sudden death. In contrast, the additional administration of the catecholamines induced a greater shortening of APD during the later phase of repolarization than during its earlier one and VPCs in all dogs tested, and sudden deaths owing to TdPs in 4 of the 6 dogs treated with D0870. These results suggest that D0870 alone does not induce TdP but that catecholamines play an important part in the development of sudden death induced by D0870 in dogs.
Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are known to be associated with the pronounced tumor response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Unfortunately, these TKI-sensitizing alterations have been detected almost exclusively in lung adenocarcinomas; indeed, their occurrence in tumors of other histologic types or other organs is exceptionally rare. Here we report a case of intragenic EGFR microdeletion in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) associated with the effect of treatment by gefitinib. Patient G., 60 years old, underwent radical surgery for clear cell RCC, however local relapse and metastatic lesions in the lungs were revealed 33 months later. The patient was successfully treated by interleukin-2 (first line therapy), tamoxifen (second line), and interferon-alpha (third line). After disease progression, EGFR mutation test was performed as a compassionate attempt. It revealed "classical" 15 base pair deletion, so gefitinib was administered. This treatment led to a dramatic symptomatic response within the first week of therapy; reduction of dyspnea was so evident that it allowed the patient to return to work. Clinical examination demonstrated significant improvement with respect to pleuritis and pericarditis. The duration of tumor response, which was classified as disease stabilization, was equal to 4 months. This case report suggests that kidney tumors have to be investigated more closely with respect to the occurrence of TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations.
Eight hundred and forty-two patients undergoing treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in hospital centres in the United Kingdom were evaluated as part of a long-term, variable dose study of the efficacy and safety of flurbiprofen in 1,396 patients with a variety of rheumatological disorders. Highly significant (p less than 0.001) improvements were evident in morning stiffness, grip strength, joint size, articular index and functional capacity at the end of the 18-month observation period reported here, as was a decrease in pain severity in all sub-groups, including those patients entering the study because of lack of effect of their previous therapy. Global assessments by doctor and patient showed highly significant improvements over this time period for both young and older patients, in whom objective improvements were less striking. Sixty-four per cent of side-effects reported were gastro-intestinal, CNS side-effects (headache, giddiness) accounting for 14%. The incidence varied according to whether or not concomitant therapy was being prescribed. Side-effects in the elderly were similar in nature to those in younger patients.
The goal of this study was to determine how often atrioventricular (AV) block is really caused by medications.
Beta-blockers, verapamil, and diltiazem are considered a cause of AV block for which pacemaker implantation is not indicated. However, it is not known if such patients can expect a benign course after discontinuation of the culprit medication.
Consecutive patients with II or III degree AV block not related to acute myocardial infarction, digitalis toxicity, or vasovagal syncope were studied. The level of AV block (AV-nodal or infranodal) was defined by electrocardiographic criteria. The cause and effect relation between AV block and drugs was defined according to the response to drug discontinuation.
Of 169 patients with AV block, 92 (54%) were receiving beta-blockers and/or verapamil or diltiazem. Patients receiving medications had similar clinical and electrocardiographic characteristics with patients who had AV block in the absence of drugs. Drug discontinuation was followed by resolution of AV block in 41% of cases, whereas spontaneous improvement of AV conduction occurred in 23% of patients who had AV block in the absence of drugs. However, 56% of the patients for whom drug discontinuation led to resolution of AV block had recurrence of AV block in the absence of therapy. Atrioventricular block that was "truly caused by drugs" was found in only 15% of patients who had II or III degree AV block during therapy with beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem.
Atrioventricular block is commonly "related to drugs" but is rarely "caused by drugs."
(1) Retrospective evaluation of the clinical course of carbamate poisoning and the effect of oxime therapy in children. (2) In vitro study of the effect of oximes on the reactivation of carbamylated cholinesterase.
(1) Clinical survey: The records of 26 children intoxicated with carbamates were examined retrospectively. The poisoning agents in all cases were positively identified as methomyl or aldicarb by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. (2) Laboratory study: The direct effect of obidoxime and of pralidoxime on acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro was investigated in normal human packed red blood cells pretreated with an organophosphate (paraoxon) or a carbamate (aldicarb or methomyl).
Pediatric intensive care unit of a teaching hospital.
Twenty-six infants and young children (aged 1 to 8 years) admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with severe carbamate intoxication.
All cases had been treated with repeated doses of atropine sulfate (0.05 mg/kg) administered every 5 to 10 minutes until muscarinic symptoms disappeared. Obidoxime chloride (Toxogonin, 6 mg/kg) was administered on admission, and again after 4 to 5 hours.
Predominant symptoms were related to central nervous system and nicotinic effects. All the patients showed marked improvement within several hours and recovered completely within 24 hours. None of the children deteriorated and none showed exacerbation of cholinergic symptoms after obidoxime treatment. In vitro, oximes reactivated acetylcholinesterase inhibited with paraoxon, whereas no significant effect of oximes on carbamylated enzyme activity was observed.
Based on the recovery of all cases, as compared with other reports of carbamate poisoning treated with atropine alone, it is concluded that, in the case of aldicarb or methomyl poisoning, oxime therapy apparently does not contribute to the recovery of poisoned patients. In cases of poisoning by an unknown pesticide or of mixed poisoning, oxime therapy can prove beneficial because no negative effects of the therapy can be discerned.
Recurrence of haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) after renal transplantation may occur in both cyclosporin A (CyA) and non-CyA-treated patients, and in patients receiving anti-lymphocyte globulin. We report a case of recurrent HUS in an 8-year-old boy who received Orthoclone (OKT3) combined with prednisolone and azathioprine therapy on receipt of his first cadaveric renal allograft. Despite avoidance of CyA therapy irreversible HUS occurred.
Hiccups can arise from idiopathic, psychogenic and organic causes. The use of therapeutic drugs forms one of the important causes of hiccups. Although the exact pathophysiological processes involved have not yet been established, the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin and gamma amino butyric aid (GABA) have been documented to play a significant role in the generation of hiccups. We report a patient of organic bipolar affective disorder who developed hiccups with the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole. The possible underlying neurotransmitter mechanisms, predisposing factors and clinical implications of this rare adverse event are discussed.
Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a new drug proposed for the treatment of acne patients. Studies on the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of adapalene have shown that it is very active on cell and tissue proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, adapalene has anti-inflammatory potential as determined by its anti-AP1 activity. Adapalene interacts selectively with the nuclear receptors RAR beta and RAR gamma, and its activity on proliferation and differentiation can be blocked by a RAR beta-gamma antagonist. Because RAR beta is not expressed in human keratinocytes, the effect of adapalene on the major cell type of the epidermis is certainly mediated by its interaction with RAR gamma. The unique pharmacological properties of adapalene may explain why, when compared to tretinoin, it has an improved therapeutic ratio due to its better tolerance.
Artemisinin, by the name of Qinghaosu, has been used in China for the treatment of fever over the years. Recently, a number of artemisinin derivatives such as artesunate, artemether, dihydroartemisinin, and arteether have been developed and have found widespread clinical use because of their efficacy against resistant forms of all plasmodial species and a favorable side-effect profile. However, concerns have been expressed about the neurotoxic effects of artemisinin derivatives based on some animal and human studies. We present a case of alpha/beta-arteether-induced mania in an adolescent having a family history of chloroquine-induced psychosis to discuss the hereditary predispositions, possible mechanisms, management, and clinical implications of this rare adverse event.
To describe the neurologic manifestations of cocaine exposure in children and adolescents as the neurologic effects of cocaine have been described in adults and neonates.
During 1-year period, 41 children between the ages of 2 months and 18 years who had been exposed to cocaine, were examined in the emergency department at the Children's National Medical Center. Cocaine exposure was documented on urine samples; all were confirmed by urine gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric analysis.
Nineteen (46%) of 41 had neurologic abnormalities, including seizures (7), obtundation (6), delirium (4), dizziness (1), drooling (1), and ataxia (1). In 14 others, the neurologic effects of cocaine were difficult to determine because of other concomitant medical conditions, including head injuries and severe abdominal or chest trauma. Two major age-related patterns were seen: (a) in each child < 5 years of age, seizures and obtundation; and (b) in 11 older children, delirium (3), dizziness (1), drooling (2), and lethargy (4). Seizures, occurring at ages 12 months to 8 years, were focal with secondary generalization in three and generalized in four. They were associated with fever in two children. Six children had no further seizures, and one developed a mixed-seizure disorder. Passive intoxication while being in a room in which "crack" was smoked was the most likely cause of exposure for young victims. Multiple drug abuse was not documented in any child with neurologic impairment.
1) Cocaine exposure is common in children in our urban setting; 2) neurologic manifestations frequently occur; 3) in children 8 years of age or younger, "passive" ingestion/inhalation is associated with focal and generalized seizures without evidence of structural brain injury; 4) cocaine may lower seizure threshold in children predisposed to seizures; 5) in children > 8 years of age, manifestations are similar to those in adults; 6) trauma and motor vehicle accidents were seen in the adolescent age group exposed to cocaine; and 7) urine toxicological study in cocaine exposure is recommended in all first-time seizures as well as first-time febrile seizures.
Data from 6 controlled clinical trials of oxprenolol carried out in the United States were reviewed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of oxprenolol in patients aged greater than or equal to 55 years. All study designs but 1 called for dosage to be increased to a maximum of 480 mg/day. In a 10-week trial of oxprenolol versus placebo given twice daily, oxprenolol reduced diastolic pressure by 8 mm Hg, while placebo reduced it by 3 mm Hg. A comparison of once-daily with twice-daily dosing showed similar results for both groups: -12/-6 mm Hg for once-daily and -9/-8 mm Hg for twice-daily. There were 2 short-term studies comparing oxprenolol and placebo, both given in addition to hydrochlorothiazide. In the first, the change in blood pressure with oxprenolol was -18/-14 mm Hg and with placebo was +6/-3 mm Hg; only 3 of 14 patients receiving oxprenolol received a maximal dosage. In the follow-up study, most of the dosages were titrated to maximum; reductions were -9/-9 mm Hg with oxprenolol treatment and 0/-12 mm Hg with placebo. Two long-term studies compared oxprenolol and propranolol, also as combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide. In the 14-week study, the reduction in blood pressure was slightly better with oxprenolol: -15/-15 versus -12/-11 mm Hg. In the 27-week study, almost half of the patients in the oxprenolol group received the maximal dosage. Blood pressure was reduced 2 or 3 mm Hg less with oxprenolol than with propranolol. Oxprenolol was well tolerated in the elderly; it produced a low incidence of typical beta-blocker side effects even when given in a once-daily regimen.
Salidroside (SAL) is one of main active components of Rhodiola rosea L. and possesses diverse pharmacological effects. However, the direct role of SAL in bone metabolism remains elusive. In this study, effects of SAL on osteoblast differentiation of murine pluripotent mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2 and osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 were examined. We first identified SAL as a potential BMP2 activator in a cell-based screening assay. SAL (0.5-10 μM) could slightly promote the proliferation and greatly increase the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in both cells. Furthermore, SAL increased the mRNA expressions of osteoblast marker genes in either C3H10T1/2 or MC3T3-E1 cells after treatment for different time. Moreover, the mineralization of C3H10T1/2 cells assayed by Alizarin red S staining was dose-dependently increased by SAL. Mechanistically, SAL increased the mRNA level of genes involved in the regulation of BMP signaling pathway, including BMP2, BMP6 and BMP7 and enhanced the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and ERK1/2. The osteogenic effect of SAL was abolished by BMP antagonist noggin or by BMP receptor kinase inhibitor dorsomorphin. Further in vivo study demonstrated that SAL reversed bone loss in ovariectomized rats. Collectively, our findings indicate that SAL regulates bone metabolism through BMP signaling pathway.
