We report a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease for 9 years who developed compulsive use of levodopa. This phenomenon is the main feature of the dopamine dysregulation syndrome. Other related symptoms presented by our patient were mood fluctuation and increased writing activity suggestive of punding.
To examine the efficacy of recombinant factor VIIa (rVIIa) in reversing warfarin-induced coagulopathy in trauma patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
Retrospective, cohort-controlled database review.
Level 1, university-affiliated trauma center.
54 patients presenting with ICH associated with chronic warfarin therapy, 30 of whom were treated with rVIIa, and the other 24 patients treated conventionally.
We examined initial and subsequent coagulation studies (prothrombin time, international normalized ratio [INR]), blood product requirement, and clinical outcome, including time to reverse anticoagulation, duration of reversal, and subsequent mortality.
Patients treated with rVIIa required significantly less plasma (4 vs 7 units) to correct their INR, and corrected in a much shorter period of time (2.4 vs 10 hrs). The duration of corrected INR after rVIIa was dose-dependent.
Factor rVIIa provides prompt correction of the INR of dose-dependent duration in patients with ICH intracranial hemorrhage associated with warfarin use.
Median convulsant (CD50) and median lethal (LD50) doses of three representative local anesthetics were determined in adult mice to evaluate the threat to life of local anesthetic-induced convulsions. The CD50 and LD50, respectively, were 57.7 and 58.7 mg/kg for bupivacaine, 111.0 and 133.1 mg/kg for lidocaine, and 243.4 and 266.5 mg/kg for chloroprocaine. When given intraperitoneally, bupivacaine thus was only about twice as toxic as lidocaine and four times as toxic as chloroprocaine. Convulsions always preceded death, except after precipitous cardiopulmonary arrest from extreme doses. A CD50 dose of local anesthetic (causing convulsions in 50% of mice) was fatal in 90% of bupivacaine-induced seizures, in 57% of the chloroprocaine group, and in 6% of the lidocaine group. The narrow gap between convulsant and lethal doses of local anesthetics indicates that untreated convulsions present much more of a threat to life than heretofore appreciated.
The literature remains unclear about the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on child development. Meanwhile, the implications for public policy and treatment and for our scientific understanding of the toxicity of cocaine are substantial. In this article we describe; (1) our current understanding of the effects of prenatal cocaine use and child outcome, (2) the issues that need to be investigated, and (3) implications for treatment of cocaine exposed children. Findings from our database of the published literature shows that our knowledge is still limited, scattered, and compromised by methodological problems that mitigate any conclusions about whether or not or how prenatal cocaine exposure affects child outcome. The cocaine problem is more complicated than first envisioned--it is a multifactorial problem including the use of other drugs, parenting, and environmental lifestyle issues. However, we also show that, even though the effects may be more subtle than initially anticipated, prenatal cocaine exposure will substantially increase in the number of school age children who will need special education services. Clinicians working with these children and families need to be prepared to address psychosocial and environmental issues, as well as developmental performance, in order to optimize their assessment and intervention.
All trans retinoic acid is the drug of choice in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. But this drug has some side effects, some of which may be life-threatening. Retinoic acid syndrome is the most frequent and dangerous side effect of this differentiation inducing agent. Other side effects include Sweet's syndrome, vasculitis, hypercalcemia, bone marrow necrosis and fibrosis, thromboembolic events, erythema nodosum, granulomatous proliferation and some pulmonary complications. Here, we report vasculitis in a case with APL treated with ATRA and review the literature.
The present study was designed to investigate the effects of angiotensin(1-7) (Ang(1-7)) a Mas receptor agonist, and A-779, a Mas receptor antagonist, in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy (DN). A single administration of streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg i.p.) to rats produced diabetes, and diabetic nephropathy developed after 8 weeks of STZ administration. The extent of DN was assessed biochemically and morphologically by measuring serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), proteinuria, urinary N-acetyl-beta-D glucosaminadase activity, renal collagen contents, lipid profile, serum nitrite/nitrate concentration and kidney weight/body weight (%). Treatments with Ang(1-7) (576 microg/kg/day i.p. for 4 weeks) and Ang(1-7) plus A-779 (744 microg/kg/day i.p. for 4 weeks) were started after 4 weeks of STZ administration. The treatment with Ang(1-7) attenuated STZ-induced nephropathy in rats by decreasing proteinuria, renal collagen content and by improving endothelial functions without preventing tubular damage. It has been shown for the first time that treatment with Ang(1-7) decreases dyslipidemia and BUN in diabetic rats, implying a renoprotective effect of the peptide. However, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and kidney weight/body weight (%) remained unaffected with Ang(1-7) treatment. It may be concluded that activation by specific agonists of the Mas receptor may be useful in combating glomerular damage in DN.
Play assessment of children with prenatal cocaine exposure is discussed in terms of the developmental play level and behaviors manifest during spontaneous play and the clinical implications for assessing such children. Studies have found a number of subtle differences in the play skills of children with prenatal cocaine exposure compared to children with no cocaine exposure, however, sensitive outcome measures are needed to capture these subtle developmental differences. Suggestions for assessing play, an early developmental skill, using multidimensional play analyses that incorporate developmental play levels and associated play behaviors, such as initiation and perseveration are discussed.
A prospective study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of adjuvant hormonotherapy in endometrial cancer after surgery. Two hundred and five patients were randomly assigned to adjuvant progestagen treatment or were given no additional therapy. The follow-up was 5-years. We concluded that there was evidence of gain from adjuvant progestagen therapy in postoperative endometrial cancer. The group of patients who received progestagens had significantly longer survival than the control group without hormonotherapy (Logrank test; P < 0.001).
Temporary amaurosis occurred after retrobulbar injection of lidocaine in 12 cases of antiglaucoma surgery in 4 years, and 10 of the patients were of late glaucoma. Lidocaine has a strong penetration potential which blocks the visual pathway, particularly for late glaucoma eyes in which the remnant optic nerve fibers may be especially sensitive to the drug. Therefore, the authors refrain from retrobulbar lidocaine in late glaucoma patients.
Chlorophyllin (CHL), a water-soluble sodium and copper derivative of chlorophyll, has been shown to be a strong antimutagen in several test systems, but its mechanism of antimutagenic action is largely unknown. In the present study, we have found the protective properties of CHL against vinyl carbamate, p-nitrophenyl vinyl ether and their electrophilic epoxides. CHL exhibited dose-related inhibition of his+ reversion in Salmonella typhimurium TA 1535 induced by these mutagens. Formation of DNA adducts from vinyl carbamate epoxide (VCO) and 2'-(4-nitrophenoxy)oxirane (NPO) was also markedly attenuated in the presence of CHL. Oral administration of CHL prior to the topical application of each of the above carcinogens resulted in significant reduction in both incidence and multiplicity of skin tumors in mice. The effective protection by CHL against VCO and NPO suggest that its formation of inactive complexes with these carcinogens is mediated by mechanisms other than pi-pi interactions.
The article deals with a serious complication of antiepileptic treatment, namely, an increase in the frequency of epileptic attacks as a result of drug overdosage. The author considers the causes of this phenomenon. The most common of these causes include malpractice of the dosage build-up in the absence of the clinical effect, polytherapy--not infrequently with drugs of the same chemical group, and insufficient attention to the potentiating drug interaction. Of particular importance is the phenomenon of "paradoxical intoxication" consisting in an increase in the frequency of epileptic attacks without any other evident signs of drug poisoning when the blood concentrations of the drug exceed the therapeutic level. The author emphasizes the importance of the early detection of electroencephalographic and clinical initial manifestations of drug poisoning the necessity to monitor the plasma concentrations of the drug and the advantages of monotherapy.
Concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and other amino acids were measured in microdissected areas of the rostral ventro-lateral medulla (RVL), nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVL) of the rat, and effects on the amino acid levels, of hypotension induced by hexamethonium and nifedipine were examined. Hexamethonium and nifedipine decreased concentrations of GABA in all the regions studied, while concentrations of glycine, beta-alanine and taurine were not affected by these agents. Both agents caused a prolonged fall in blood pressure. These results strongly suggest that a decrease in blood pressure produces a decrease in GABA levels in the brainstem regions of the rat.
Lidocaine is one of the most frequently used drugs to suppress ventricular arrhythmias; however, it has caused sinus arrest when given in excess or along with other antiarrhythmics (quinidine, phenytoin, amiodorane). A case of asystole after a conventional dose of lidocaine and resuscitation following discontinuance is reported. Although such complications are rare, the widespread utilization of this drug requires emergency physicians to recognize the potential for this problem.
Using the parameters of the special synchronization of cortical biopotentials, the authors studied changes in the function of the cerebral cortex in patients with the generalized form of epilepsy with a further progression of the disease and under the effect of the typical neuroleptic haloperidol and atypical neuroleptic clozapine. These drugs have been found to act differently on the epileptic process and on the effects of the hyperventilation test, which appears to be due to their differing ability to block receptors of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. The data have shown that haloperidol increases the risk of the development of epileptic attacks while clozapine reduces epileptic manifestations.
Liposomes used for delivering antineoplastic drugs to sites of disease are able to minimize side effects and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Liposomal Daunorubicin (Daunoxome; DNX) has a selective and higher accumulation in neoplastic tissues and seems to be able to escape Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR). We treated 35 elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with PVBECDNX, a regimen analogue to P-VABEC in which doxorubicin is replaced with DNX at a dose of 50 mg (first 13 patients) and thereafter 50 mg/m2. Twenty-six out of 35 patients were evaluable for response; 15 obtained a CR, 5 a PR (overall response rate of 77%). After a median follow-up of 13 months the 2-years actuarial overall survival was 75% and the failure-free survival was 71%. Two patients out of six no responders died because of progression of disease, and one died in CR because of pre-existing cardiovascular disorders. Eight patients did not tolerate DNX infusion (back pain). Non-haematological toxicity was mild. This study confirms that PVABEC-like regimens are able to induce a high overall response rate in a percentage of patients affected by aggressive lymphoma and shows that DNX is as effective as Daunorubicin in these disorders, but its acute toxicity is reduced.
Physostigmine, administered intravenously, reversed postural hypotension induced by hypotensive agents, guanethidine, clonidine and dopamine2-receptor agonists. Postural hypotension, induced by pentobarbital sodium, was also reversed by physostigmine. Neostigmine reversed postural hypotension induced by clonidine following intracerebroventricular, but not intravenous administration. It is proposed that centrally acting cholinomimetic agents may be used to manage postural hypotension resulting from suppression of sympathetic nervous system activity.
Myoclonic jerks involving the proximal limb musculature and tic-like movements (sniffing, coughing, or sighing) were observed in an 11-year-old boy with benign occipital epilepsy treated with carbamazepine (CBZ). The involuntary movements disappeared a few days after withdrawal of CBZ and reappeared with CBZ reintroduction. Plasma CBZ levels were always within the therapeutic range. Polygraphic studies failed to show any electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during myoclonic jerks. Appearance of nonepileptic myoclonus in epileptic children treated with CBZ should be carefully evaluated to prevent worsening of the clinical picture. The coexistence of other involuntary movements (tics) could suggest the correct diagnosis.
The records of 1087 full- and pre-term infants with normal hearing were reviewed for auditory brain-stem response (ABR) abnormalities. Subjects were classified according to various complications common to the newborn. A logistic regression analysis was performed in order to determine the risk of incurring ABR deviations associated with specific diagnoses in the nursery. Infants exposed to cocaine in utero and those with neurological signs or demonstrable brain anomalies were 4-5 times more likely to exhibit deviant ABRs. The synergistic effects of selected predictor variables further increased the risk for abnormal responses depending on gestational age and type of disorder. These results suggest subtle neurologic influences persisting at the time of discharge.
The purpose of this study was to test the potential utility of mexiletine for the treatment of drug-induced long QT syndrome in vivo. Beagle dogs were anesthetized with halothane inhalation (n =7). Monophasic action potential (MAP) of the right ventricle, ECG, systemic and left ventricular pressure, cardiac output and effective refractory period (ERP) of the right ventricle were measured. The electrically vulnerable period was estimated by the difference between MAP duration and ERP. An intentionally high dose of 1 mg/kg, i.v. of cisapride decreased the heart rate, mean blood pressure, left ventricular contraction and cardiac output and prolonged the ventricular repolarization phase and ERP, in which the increment was greater in the former than in the latter, indicating the increase of electrical vulnerability. The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and atrioventricular as well as intraventricular conduction were hardly affected. Additional administration of an antiarrhythmic dose of 3 mg/kg, i.v. of mexiletine increased the heart rate, decreased the left ventricular contraction and cardiac output, suppressed the atrioventricular as well as intraventricular conduction, and prolonged the ERP, but shortened the ventricular repolarization phase. There was no change in the afterload and preload of the left ventricle. Thus, mexiletine decreased the electrical vulnerability of the heart during cisapride overdose, suggesting that it may become a potential pharmacological strategy for drug-induced long QT syndrome.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease in which approximately 40% of the patients respond well to current chemotherapy, but the prognosis for the other 60% is poor. The Leukemia/Lymphoma Molecular Profiling Project (LLMPP) used microarray technology to define a molecular profile for each of 240 patients with DLBCL and develop a molecular outcome predictor score that accurately predicted patient survival. Data from our laboratory and others suggest that alterations in antioxidant defense enzyme levels and redox environment can be oncogenic and affect the response to glucocorticoid treatment, one of the components of combination chemotherapy regimens for lymphoma. The goal of the current study was to reanalyze the LLMPP microarray data to determine whether the levels of antioxidant defense enzymes and redox proteins were correlated with prognosis in DLBCL. We found that patients with DLBCL with the worst prognosis, according to the outcome predictor score, had decreased expression of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, manganese superoxide dismutase, and VDUP1, a protein that inhibits thioredoxin activity. The data suggest that the patients with the worst prognosis combine a decrease in antioxidant defense enzyme expression with an increase in thioredoxin system function (the redox signature score).
Cholestatic liver fibrosis, characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, is associated with bile acid-induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. We evaluated the therapeutic or protective effect of an aqueous extract of Artemisia iwayomogi Kitamura (WAI) in a rat bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis model. After BDL, rats were treated once daily with 25 or 50 mg/kg of WAI for 2weeks. The serum bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, malondialdehyde, and liver hydroxyproline levels were drastically increased in the BDL group. WAI administration significantly reduced these markers and restored BDL-induced depletion of glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase activity. Cholestatic liver injury and collagen deposition were markedly attenuated by WAI treatment, and these changes were paralleled by significantly suppressed gene and protein expression of fibrogenic factors, including hepatic alphasmooth muscle actin, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor β. Our data suggest that WAI may have antifibrotic properties via both improvement of antioxidant activities and inhibition of ECM protein production in the rat model of BDL.
In a 6-week double-blind parallel treatment study, dothiepin and amitriptyline were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 depressed outpatients. Dothiepin and amitriptyline were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of depressive illness, and both were significantly superior to placebo. The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of blurred vision, dry mouth, and drowsiness were significantly less with dothiepin than with amitriptyline. Dothiepin also produced fewer CNS and cardiovascular effects. There were no clinically important changes in laboratory parameters. Dothiepin thus was found to be an effective antidepressant drug associated with fewer side effects than amitriptyline in the treatment of depressed outpatients.
Acquired inhibitors to FVIII (anti-FVIII) are uncommon in children. An acquired anti-FVIII developed in a previously healthy 4-year-old boy treated with penicillin for streptococcal pharyngitis. Aspirin prophylaxis begun for suspected rheumatic fever led to compartment syndromes of all four extremities, which resolved with high-dose FVIII and surgical decompression. Anti-FVIII in this patient, and the five additional cases identified in a survey of 160 haemophilia treatment centres, occurred at a median age of 8 years, with median initial and peak titres of 4.6 and 6.9 Bethesda Units (BU), respectively. All six presented with bleeding, including haematomas (three intramuscular, one intracranial), and ecchymoses in three. The median baseline FVIII was 0.05 U mL(-1), and the median baseline activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 79.8 s. The inhibitor resolved completely in five patients (83%) within a median 5 months, after treatment with FVIII concentrate, steroids, cytoxan, methotrexate, and no treatment. The inhibitor persisted in the patient with Goodpasture's disease, despite steroids, cytoxan, cyclosporin, and intravenous gamma globulin. Aspirin therapy, in two, worsened ongoing bleeding. The association of penicillin-like drugs in this and three other cases in the literature suggest that to avoid potential catastrophic bleeding, it is prudent to obtain an APTT prior to initiating aspirin for suspected rheumatic fever. In conclusion, acquired anti-FVIII inhibitors in children may cause severe bleeding, and remit in the majority after FVIII and/or immunosuppressive therapy.
Human semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) or vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is a copper-containing amine oxidase (AOC3, EC 1.4.3.6) that has both enzymatic and adhesive function. SSAO catalyzes the oxidative deamination of primary amines, resulting in the formation of the corresponding aldehyde and release of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. Membrane-bound SSAO is an inflammation-inducible endothelial cell adhesion molecule that mediates the interaction between leukocytes and activated endothelial cells in inflamed vessels. Both the direct adhesive and enzymatic functions seem to be involved in the adhesion cascade. LJP 1207 [N'-(2-phenyl-allyl)-hydrazine hydrochloride] is a potent (human SSAO IC(50) = 17 nM), selective, and orally available SSAO inhibitor that blocks both the enzymatic and adhesion functions of SSAO/VAP-1. In a mouse model of ulcerative colitis, LJP 1207 significantly reduces mortality, loss of body weight, and colonic cytokine levels. Quantitative histopathological assessment of colitis activity in this model showed a highly significant suppression of inflammation, injury, and ulceration scores in the animals treated with the SSAO/VAP-1 inhibitor. LJP 1207 also reduced serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 6 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice and prolonged survival post-LPS-induced endotoxemia. Therapeutic and prophylactic administration of LJP 1207 in the rat carrageenan footpad model also markedly inhibited swelling and inflammation. Overall, the data suggest that small molecule SSAO/VAP-1 inhibitors may provide clinical benefit in the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.
The non-hematological side effects of levamisole include (1) sensorineural reactions, the most common of which is alterating of taste and smell; (2) idiosyncratic or allergic reactions such as rash and a febrile, influenza-like illness; and (3) gastro-intestinal symptoms. The sensorineural reactions are seldom of sufficient severity to require discontinuation of treatment. Rash and febrile illness have resulted in withdrawal of levamisole in 7% and 1.5% of cases, respectively, but usually remit spontaneously within a brief interval and are not hazardous except when associated with agranulocytosis. Rash due to levamisole occurs more frequently in rheumatic disease patients than in other conditions. Gastro-intestinal symptoms are mild, quickly reversible, and possibly dose-related; some controlled trails have shown a similar frequency of gastro-intestinal symptoms in the placebo group.
