Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) has emerged as an anticancer drug of considerable value for the chemotherapy of several human neoplasms. However, this agent often causes renal toxicity, which appears to be the dose-limiting untoward effect. The present animal study was undertaken to compare, with regard to kidney injury and renal tissue repair, cisplatin and carboplatin (cis-diammine-1,1-cyclobutane dicarboxylate platinum II), a platinum derivative more recently introduced in clinics. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (four animals per group) were treated ip with cisplatin (4 or 8 mg/kg, delivered in four consecutive daily injections) or carboplatin (40 mg/kg given in one injection) and terminated 4, 7, and 21 days after drug administration. One hour prior to sacrifice, each animal received ip 200 microCi of [3H]thymidine for the measurement of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (frequency of S-phase cells in renal tissue, determined by histoautoradiography). Cisplatin, particularly at 8 mg/kg, caused severe tubular injury (acute tubular necrosis) culminating in a long-lasting cystic tubular dilatation in the outer stripe of outer medulla. Tubular damage was followed by a sharp proliferative response, indicative of tubular regeneration. However, the proliferative activity was still above basal level at the end of the observation period, suggesting that the tissue repair process had not reached completeness 3 weeks after cisplatin administration. In contrast, carboplatin only induced focal tubular necrosis in proximal tubules. Distal and collecting tubules also showed ultrastructural evidence of hydropic degeneration after exposure to the latter drug. Renal tubular injury associated with carboplatin was followed by a mild proliferative response. From this study, we can infer that carboplatin is less nephrotoxic than cisplatin, but still causes histopathological alterations in renal tissue. Furthermore, the lesser nephrotoxicity of carboplatin has a primary origin and is not due to a more efficient tissue repair reaction.
Methodological questions of clinical observation and classification of drug-induced extrapyramidal symptomatology are discussed. In our experimental approach we examined two groups of 20 acute schizophrenic patients each. The patients were treated for 4 weeks under double-blind conditions with the butyrophenone derivative Haloperidol and with the benzoxazepine derivative Loxapin respectively. The extrapyramidal disturbances appearing under these medications were studied. The patients were examined by means of the EPS-scale by Simpson and Angus weekly, before, during and after this treatment as well as under a subsequent therapy with a longacting neuroleptic. Extrapyramidal disturbances appearing between these fixed rating times were noted in a check list. According to a classification propased by Chien and Di-Mascio the symptomatology of extrapyramidal disturbances under neuroleptic therapy can be divided into "permanent neuroleptic manifestations" on the one hand and "paroxysmal neurodysleptic manifestations" on the other. While Haloperidol caused more distinct symptoms of permanent neuroleptic manifestations, acute neurodysleptic reactions appeared more frequently under Loxapin therapy.
Since 1982, we have performed 384 courses of CHOP chemotherapy for 89 patients with malignancy including 70 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, adhering to the original regimen as strictly as possible. As severe acute reactions, myelosuppression, fever, arrhythmia, hemorrhagic cystitis, and perforation of duodenal ulcer were seen. Rates of fever had no tendency to increase with advancing age. Three patients only with diabetes mellitus had no severe side effects. Three patients with liver cirrhosis showed severe myelosuppression and fever. One patient both with liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus died from the infection due to CHOP chemotherapy, however the other febrile patients did not have life threatening infection. Thirty three percent (11/33 courses) of the patients with obesity experienced severe myelosuppression (WBC less than 1,000), while 55% (33/60 courses) of the patients without obesity. However satisfactory treatment results were not obtained in the patients with obesity. We consider that CHOP chemotherapy is excellent in feasibility even for the aged patients or the patients with diabetes mellitus. However, we suggest that the dose of CHOP chemotherapy should be reduced for the patients with liver cirrhosis.
The effect of d-alpha-tocopherol on the progression of renal dysfunction was investigated in rats injected with adriamycin (ADR), a model of progressive glomerulosclerosis associated with the nephrotic syndrome. Treatment with d-alpha-tocopherol was started 1 day before or 1 day after ADR injections (BE-TOC or AF-TOC rats). When compared to rats without d-alpha-tocopherol treatment (ADR-CON rats), the serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the BE-TOC and AF-TOC groups. In week 16, the LDL cholesterol level and the atherogenic index were both significantly lower in BE-TOC and AF-TOC rats than in ADR-CON rats. The urinary protein, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, malondialdehyde, and systolic blood pressure levels as well as the glomerulosclerosis score were high in ADR-CON rats, and reduced in BE-TOC or AF-TOC rats. There were no significant differences in body weight and serum albumin between the three groups in week 16. It is concluded that d-alpha-tocopherol can improve hyperlipidemia and ameliorate glomerulosclerosis in rats with ADR-induced progressive renal failure. Thus, d-alpha-tocopherol may have the potential for clinical application to treat focal glomerulosclerosis.
This prospective longitudinal single institution cohort study evaluated the natural history of and risk factors for chronic nephrotoxicity 10 years after ifosfamide treatment in childhood.
Twenty-five patients (16 males) treated with ifosfamide were investigated at end of treatment (End), 1 and 10 years later. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum phosphate (PO4) and bicarbonate (HCO3) and renal tubular threshold for phosphate (Tmp/GFR) were measured, and total nephrotoxicity score (Ns) graded.
More patients had a low GFR at 1 (72%) and 10 (50%) years than at End (26%) (P = 0.006 for End vs. 1 year). Electrolyte supplementation requirements for tubular toxicity resolved by 10 years (0% vs. 32% at End and 24% at 1 year; both P < 0.05). At 10 years, 17% of patients had moderate overall nephrotoxicity and 13% clinically significant reduction of GFR (<60 ml/min/1.73 m2). Neither dose nor age at treatment predicted any measure of toxicity at 10 years or reduced GFR at any timepoint. Higher cumulative ifosfamide dose correlated with greater tubular and overall nephrotoxicity at End and/or 1 year (P < 0.05 for each of PO4, HCO3, Tmp/GFR, Ns), but age at treatment did not differ between patients with normal or abnormal results.
Although clinically significant tubular toxicity had resolved by 10 years, GFR was <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 13% of patients, raising concerns about very long-term glomerular function. Higher cumulative dose was associated with greater tubular and overall toxicity at End and 1 year, but not at 10 years. Age at treatment did not predict nephrotoxicity at any timepoint.
The addition of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to frontline therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has been shown to result in significant improvements in disease-free survival (DFS). FLT3 mutations are frequently observed in APL, but its prognostic significance remains unclear. We analyzed 245 newly diagnosed adult patients with APL treated on intergroup trial C9710 and evaluated previously defined biological and prognostic factors and their relationship to FLT3 mutations and to additional karyotypic abnormalities. FLT3 mutations were found in 48% of patients, including 31% with an internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), 14% with a point mutation (FLT3-D835) and 2% with both mutations. The FLT3-ITD mutant level was uniformly low, < 0.5. Neither FLT3 mutation had an impact on remission rate, induction death rate, DFS or overall survival (OS). The addition of ATO consolidation improved outcomes regardless of FLT3 mutation type or level, initial white blood cell count, PML-RARA isoform type or transcript level. The presence of a complex karyotype was strongly associated with an inferior OS independently of post-remission treatment. In conclusion, the addition of ATO to frontline therapy overcomes the impact of previously described adverse prognostic factors including FLT3 mutations. However, complex karyotype is strongly associated with an inferior OS despite ATO therapy.
The pathogenesis and the impact of therapy on thrombin activation in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are unknown. Steroids may contribute to ALL-associated thrombosis. We explored the hemostatic effects of methylprednisolone monotherapy (MpMT) (32 mg/m2/day IV x 3 days) in children with newly diagnosed ALL.
Children (>1 to < or = 18 years of age) enrolled on DFCI ALL05-01 protocol (n = 30; mean age 6.3 years), without prior steroid therapy, were eligible for study. Overnight fasting pre- and post-MpMT samples were analyzed for coagulation factors [FVIII:C, von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) and fibrinogen] and parameters of thrombin generation [prothrombin fragments 1.2 (F1.2), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), and D-dimer].
At diagnosis F1.2 (1.5 nmol/L), TAT (10.9 microg/L), and D-dimers (2,766 ng/ml) levels were increased indicating endogenous thrombin activation. Patients with peripheral blasts (n = 17) had higher levels of vWF:Ag (1.89 vs. 1.14 P = 0.001), TAT (15.39 vs. 5.02 P = 0.038), and D-dimer (3,640 vs. 1,623 P = 0.019) compared to those without peripheral blasts. Following MpMT the blast count decreased significantly from 24% to 3.5% (P < 0.001) with reduction in level of vWF:Ag (1.5, P < 0.01), TAT (8.9, P = 0.42), and D-dimer (P = 0.018) despite 30% increase in FVIII:C levels (P = 0.005). However, patients without peripheral blasts had no significant change in vWF:Ag levels (1.14 vs. 1.25; P = 0.142) and had an increase in thrombin generation parameters.
We postulate that peripheral blasts through endothelial activation stimulate vWF:Ag production/secretion causing coagulation activation. Methylprednisolone therapy reduces the blast count and indirectly suppresses the coagulation activation. Future studies are required to confirm these findings.
Phongsaly Province, located in the northernmost area of Lao PDR, was previously suggested to be endemic for the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini infection. To confirm, or rule out, this suggestion, the Phonxay village in the Khoua District, Phongsaly Province, was selected for a survey. Ten volunteers (8 men and 2 women aged 31-57 years) who consumed raw freshwater fish and had gastrointestinal troubles were treated with a single dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg) and pyrantel pamoate (10 mg/kg) and purged with magnesium sulfate to recover any worm parasites. Eight of the 10 volunteers expelled 1 or more species of trematodes, nematodes, or cestodes (worm positive rate; 80%). The worms were morphologically identified as H. taichui (861 worms from 8 people), H. yokogawai (59 from 6 people), Phaneropsolus bonnei (1 from 1 person), Trichostrongylus sp. (2 from 2 people), Ascaris lumbricoides (2 from 1 person), Enterobius vermicularis (11 from 3 people), and Taenia saginata (1 strobila with scolex from 1 person). The results indicate that the mountainous area of Phongsaly Province, Lao PDR, is not endemic for the liver fluke but endemic for intestinal flukes, in particular, Haplorchis taichui and H. yokogawai.
Recent attention has focused on the relationship between depression and smoking cessation. This article describes 5 cases of severe depression that occurred during 2 multicenter trials using bupropion for smoking cessation.
Subjects were participants in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion for smoking cessation. Data from both trials were restricted to subjects at the Rochester, Minn., site in order to have access to the medical records for information on depression diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. The first trial involved 205 smokers who received active bupropion or placebo for 7 weeks. In the second trial, 252 smokers received open-label bupropion therapy for 7 weeks. Those abstinent from smoking at the end of week 7 (N = 148) were randomly assigned to a 45-week, double-blind, relapse-prevention phase.
In the first trial, 1 of the 205 participants (0.49%) experienced major depression during the 7-week treatment phase. In the second trial, none of the 252 subjects developed major depression during the 7-week, open-label phase. When results of both trials across the 7-week treatment phase (study 1, N = 205; study 2, N = 252) are combined, the rate of developing major depression was 0.22% (1 of 457). Of the 457 subjects, none of the 51 who received placebo and 1 (0.25%) of the 406 who received active bupropion developed major depression. In the second trial, 4 (2.7%) of the 148 subjects randomly assigned to the 45-week, relapse-prevention phase developed depression. Overall, 4 of the 5 cases from the 2 trials had a past history of major depression prior to study entry, but none had current major depression.
Major depression may occur in some individuals during smoking cessation treatment with bupropion.
Pantoprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) that is commonly prescribed for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux-related disorders. There are many documented side effects of PPIs. Here we report a case of acute interstitial nephritis, which developed after 6 weeks of treatment with pantoprazole. A 23-year-old man presented with acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Acute interstitial nephritis was diagnosed by renal biopsy and was successfully treated with corticosteroids and withdrawal of pantoprazole. Drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis can occur with PPIs such as pantoprazole and vigilance needs to be maintained.
The number of individuals exposed to high levels of tungsten is increasing, yet there is limited knowledge of the potential human health risks. Recently, a cohort of breast cancer patients was left with tungsten in their breasts following testing of a tungsten-based shield during intraoperative radiotherapy. While monitoring tungsten levels in the blood and urine of these patients, we utilized the 66Cl4 cell model, in vitro and in mice to study the effects of tungsten exposure on mammary tumor growth and metastasis. We still detect tungsten in the urine of patients' years after surgery (mean urinary tungsten concentration at least 20 months post-surgery = 1.76 ng/ml), even in those who have opted for mastectomy, indicating that tungsten does not remain in the breast. In addition, standard chelation therapy was ineffective at mobilizing tungsten. In the mouse model, tungsten slightly delayed primary tumor growth, but significantly enhanced lung metastasis. In vitro, tungsten did not enhance 66Cl4 proliferation or invasion, suggesting that tungsten was not directly acting on 66Cl4 primary tumor cells to enhance invasion. In contrast, tungsten changed the tumor microenvironment, enhancing parameters known to be important for cell invasion and metastasis including activated fibroblasts, matrix metalloproteinases, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We show, for the first time, that tungsten enhances metastasis in an animal model of breast cancer by targeting the microenvironment. Importantly, all these tumor microenvironmental changes are associated with a poor prognosis in humans.
Aquagenic wrinkling of the palms (AWP) is a rare condition, defined clinically by the appearance or accentuation of an asymmetrical, translucent to white, papular eruption on the palms after immersion in water. It is associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), and approximately half of all reported cases occur in patients with documented CF. We report a case of AWP in a young woman with CF, where the AWP was related to treatment with the aminoglycoside antibiotic, tobramycin. Although the mechanism of AWP is unknown, influx of water across an osmotic gradient into eccrine ducts has been proposed. Aminoglycosides may affect AWP by blocking various cell surface channels and receptors, which may influence cell-volume regulation.
Adriamycin is a potent anticancer agent, its clinical use is limited for its marked cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The present study aimed to investigate the possible protective role of the natural antioxidant silymarin on ADR-induced heart and kidney toxicity. Studies were performed on four groups of rats. 1--control group, 2--silymarin group (50 mg/kg), 3--adriamycin group (10 mg/kg), 4--adriamycin+silymarin group. On the third day after ADR injection, plasma was separated for determination of LDH, CPK, cholesterol and total lipids. 30 days after ADR injection, plasma was separated for determination of creatinine and urea levels. Frozen heart specimens (72 h) and frozen kidney specimens (30days) were used for estimation of lipid peroxides and GSH contents. Histopathological examinations of heart and kidney sections were also done. Pretreatment of ADR-treated rats with silymarin resulted in a significant decrease in the plasma CPK, LDH, creatinine and urea. On the other hand silymarin pretreatment did not change ADR-induced hyperlipidemia. Silymarin pretreatment significantly decreased the myocardial MDA contents. In addition, silymarin pretreatment normalized renal tissue contents of MDA and GSH. Histopathological examination of heart and kidney sections revealed that ADR caused only mild myocardial injury in silymarin pretreated rats. Also, silymarin pretreatment inhibited ADR-induced renal tubular damage in rats. These results have suggested that, silymarin ameliorated ADR-induced cardiotoxicity and protected against ADR-induced nephrotoxicity in male albino rats. The mechanisms of silymarin induced protection against ADR-induced toxicities were proved to be due to inhibition of lipid peroxidation and protection against GSH depletion.
Protein 4.2 is a major red blood cell (RBC) protein that interacts with the band 3 protein and with ankyrin. Inherited deficiencies of this protein are associated with spherocytic hemolytic anemia, but the molecular basis of this defect is unknown. We have studied the underlying defect in a patient with spherocytic hemolytic anemia whose RBCs had a partial (29% +/- 5%) deficiency of protein 4.2. We have first studied the binding of normal ankyrin and protein 4.2 to patient inside-out vesicles (IOVs) stripped of peripheral proteins. While the binding of ankyrin was normal, the predicted maximal binding capacity of patient IOVs for band 4.2 was 20% to 33% lower than that of control IOVs, suggesting a defect in the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (cdb3). An additional line of evidence pointing to a possible abnormality of band 3 was an abnormal proteolytic digest of cdb3. To elucidate the underlying molecular defect, we have cloned and sequenced the cDNA coding for cdb3 from the patient. One band 3 allele was found to be normal, while clones corresponding to the other allele contained two mutations: substitution A----G in nucleotide 166, changing codon 56 from AAG to GAG (Lys----Glu), and substitution C----G in nucleotide 980, changing codon 327 from CCC to CGC (Pro----Arg). Since the Lys56----Glu56 substitution is found in a common asymptomatic variant of the band 3 protein designated band 3 Memphis, we conclude that either the Pro327----Arg327 substitution itself, or in combination with the band 3 Memphis polymorphism, underlies the abnormal binding of protein 4.2 to cdb3 and results in the spherocytic phenotype.
Rare inactivating mutations in the BRCA1 gene seem to play a limited role in prostate cancer. To our knowledge, however, no study has comprehensively assessed the role of other BRCA1 sequence variations (e.g., missense mutations) in prostate cancer. In a study of 817 men with and without prostate cancer from 323 familial and early-onset prostate cancer families, we used family-based association tests and conditional logistic regression to investigate the association between prostate cancer and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging common haplotype variation in a 200-kb region surrounding (and including) the BRCA1 gene. We also used the Genotype-Identity-by-Descent Sharing Test to determine whether our most strongly associated SNP could account for prostate cancer linkage to chromosome 17q21 in a sample of 154 families from our previous genome-wide linkage study. The strongest evidence for prostate cancer association was for a glutamine-to-arginine substitution at codon 356 (Gln(356)Arg) in exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene. The minor (Arg) allele was preferentially transmitted to affected men (P = 0.005 for a dominant model), with an estimated odds ratio of 2.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.21-4.20). Notably, BRCA1 Gln(356)Arg is not in strong linkage disequilibrium with other BRCA1 coding SNPs or any known HapMap SNP on chromosome 17. In addition, Genotype-Identity-by-Descent Sharing Test results suggest that Gln(356)Arg accounts (in part) for our prior evidence of prostate cancer linkage to chromosome 17q21 (P = 0.022). Thus, we have identified a common, nonsynonymous substitution in the BRCA1 gene that is associated with and linked to prostate cancer.
Recent evidence suggests that inhaled furosemide relieves dyspnoea in patients and in normal subjects made dyspnoeic by external resistive loads combined with added dead-space. Furosemide sensitizes lung inflation receptors in rats, and lung inflation reduces air hunger in humans. We therefore hypothesised that inhaled furosemide acts on the air hunger component of dyspnoea. Ten subjects inhaled aerosolized furosemide (40 mg) or placebo in randomised, double blind, crossover experiments. Air hunger was induced by hypercapnia (50+/-2 mmHg) during constrained ventilation (8+/-0.9 L/min) before and after treatment, and rated by subjects using a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Subjects described a sensation of air hunger with little or no work/effort of breathing. Hypercapnia generated less air hunger in the first trial at 23+/-3 min after start of furosemide treatment (58+/-11% to 39+/-14% full scale); the effect varied substantially among subjects. The mean treatment effect, accounting for placebo, was 13% of full scale (P=0.052). We conclude that 40 mg of inhaled furosemide partially relieves air hunger within 1h and is accompanied by substantial diuresis.
Carboplatin and melphalan are two drugs whose toxicity profile makes them suitable for use in high doses followed by stem cell rescue. We report the use of high-dose carboplatin, with the dose based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), combined with melphalan followed by autologous stem cell rescue in children with advanced stage or chemoresistant solid tumours. Thirty children were treated. After multiagent induction chemotherapy before BMT, 13 were in CR, five in VGPR, 11 in PR and one had progressive disease. They received melphalan, 180 mg/m2 and carboplatin, followed by autologous stem cell rescue. The dose of carboplatin was varied by GFR rather than fixed by surface area. The dose given ranged from 0.7 to 2.6 g/m2. Haematological and gastrointestinal toxicities were severe. Life-threatening or fatal toxicity was attributable to opportunistic infection in two cases and regimen-related in two cases. Of the 30 patients, 15 are alive and 13 disease-free at 4-36 months post-BMT. This simple two-drug combination has been used as consolidation of initial remission for patients with high-risk tumours. The toxicity is severe but tolerable. Use of a carboplatin dose based on GFR should optimise effectiveness in patients with good renal function and avoid excessive toxicity where renal function is impaired.
The effects of intravenously administered lidocaine on the cerebral cortical energy state and glycolytic metabolism were studied in rats. In one series, rats were divided into five groups according to EEG patterns, i.e., control, desynchronized, synchronized, seizure (1-min duration) and recovery groups. With lidocaine infusion (0.75 mg/min), there were no significant changes from the control group in the cerebral energy state except for a modest increase in phosphocreatine (PCr) in the seizure group and a small decrease in ADP in the non-seizure groups. The cerebral energy charge remained unchanged. Lactate and pyruvate significantly decreased in the non-seizure groups. In a second series, rats were divided into five groups, i.e., control, lidocaine seizure groups (5-min duration, 1.5 mg/min) at hypocapnia, normocapnia and hypercapnia, and a bicuculline (1.2 mg/kg) seizure group. The metabolic changes during lidocaine seizure were essentially the same as those observed in the seizure group in the first series. However, the increase in PCr during lidocaine seizure was significant only in the hypocapnic and the normocapnic groups. Bicuculline-induced seizures were accompanied by a significant decrease in high energy phosphates. In summary, neither a non-seizure nor-seizure dose of lidocaine caused any reduction in the cerebral energy charge nor was there any evidence of increased anaerobic metabolism in the cerebral cortex during lidocaine-induced seizures.
Because chronic vincristine (VCR) treatment causes neuropathic pain, as demonstrated by mechanical allodynia, effective therapeutic strategy is required. In this study, we investigated a suppressive effect of imipramine (IMI) on VCR-induced mechanical allodynia in mice. VCR (0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) was administered once per day for 7 d in ICR male mice. Mechanical allodynia was evaluated by withdrawal response using von Frey filaments. In VCR-treated mice, mechanical allodynia was observed on day 3, 7, and 14. On day 14, morphine (3 mg/kg, subcutaneously) slightly but significantly suppressed VCR-induced mechanical allodynia. The percent inhibition by morphine of VCR-induced mechanical allodynia was less than that of the lambda-carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain and was similar to that of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. Although single administration of IMI (30 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect on VCR-induced mechanical allodynia, repeated administration of IMI (30 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 d significantly suppressed VCR-induced mechanical allodynia. Suppressive effects by repeated IMI administration were observed in both early phase (day 0-6) and late phase (day 7-13) of VCR-induced mechanical allodynia. These results suggest that chronic VCR administration induces opioid analgesics-resistant mechanical allodynia, and repeated IMI administration may be an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of VCR-induced mechanical allodynia.
Structural studies on a hereditarily abnormal prothrombin, prothrombin Tokushima, have been performed to identify the difference responsible for its reduced fibrinogen clotting activity upon conversion to thrombin. The prothrombin sample used was from a heterozygote but contained exclusively a defective prothrombin molecule, since the patient was heterozygous for both dysprothrombinemia and hypoprothrombinemia. Amino acid sequence analysis of a peptide isolated from a lysyl endopeptidase digest of the abnormal thrombin indicated that Arg-418 (equivalent to Asn-101 in the chymotrypsin numbering system) had been replaced by Trp. This amino acid substitution can result from a single nucleotide change in the codon for Arg-418 (CGG----TGG). The Arg----Trp replacement found in the thrombin portion of prothrombin Tokushima appears to reduce its interaction with various substrates including fibrinogen and platelet receptors and accounts for the recurrent bleeding episode observed in the propositus.
Nasal steroid drops can produce iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome if the recommended dose is exceeded. We now report a 19-year-old male patient for whom dexamethasone nasal drops were prescribed because of nasal obstruction. He had been using these drops for more than 5 years, with a daily dexamethasone dose of 0.7-1.0 mg. It is likely that significant amounts of dexamethasone were swallowed and absorbed by the patient's gastrointestinal tract. As a consequence, the patient developed Cushing's syndrome with panhypopituitarism, growth retardation, osteoporosis and hypertension. A boyish size of the larynx resulted in a fundamental speaking frequency of a child. After discontinuing the intranasal use of the of dexamethasone and adjusting doses of hydrocortisone over 3.5 months a normalization of endocrine function occurred with the beginning of puberty and normal sexual changes. These findings show that the use of nasal steroid drops particularly in children should be limited to a short period and drugs with a low absorption dose employed.
Prenatal exposure to mercury causes neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological pathologies in infants, such as microcephaly and mental retardation. Despite critical importance, the molecular interactions leading to mercury toxicity are yet to be elucidated. We first used a cell-free assay to investigate mercury effects on purified γ-secretase activity. Next, we treated adult Drosophila melanogaster with mercury and collected control and mercury-treated embryos, which were subjected to mild hypotonic protein extraction, or immunostained to reveal nervous system morphology. Embryos left to develop into adults were examined for wing phenotypes. Relative to control metals, we found that mercury strongly inhibits in vitro γ-secretase processing of both amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and Notch. Mercury inhibited APP and Notch cleavage in a dose-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of 50-125 nM, and is therefore comparable in potency to benchmark γ-secretase inhibitors. Immunoblot analysis of embryonic protein extracts showed that mercury inhibits Notch cleavage by γ-secretase in vivo. This is accompanied by severe neurodevelopmental abnormalities in embryos and adult wing-notching phenotypes. Our findings provide first evidence that mercury is a direct and potent γ-secretase inhibitor and suggest that inhibition of γ-secretase and disruption of the Notch developmental pathway potentially contribute to mercury-induced toxicity in the nervous system.
