Pegfilgrastim is composed of the protein filgrastim to which a 20-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) is covalently bound at the N-terminal residue resulting in decreased renal clearance and increased plasma half-life compared with filgrastim. This open-label, randomized, phase 2 study compared two doses of single administration pegfilgrastim (60 and 100 microg/kg) with daily doses of filgrastim (5 microg/kg/day) or no cytokine treatment after standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 50 elderly patients. The primary endpoint was the duration of grade 4 (severe) neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/l) in cycle 1. Duration of grade 4 neutropenia in cycle 1 was 2.2 (SD 1.2), 1.5 (SD 1.1), 0.8 (1.2) and 5.0 (2.0) days for patients who received pegfilgrastim 60 microg/kg, pegfilgrastim 100 microg/kg, filgrastim 5 microg/kg and no cytokine, respectively. The baseline characteristics of the pegfilgrastim and filgrastim groups were imbalanced with increased bone-marrow involvement and prior therapy in the former. When the treatment groups were balanced for these risk factors, duration of grade 4 neutropenia was comparable with 2.0 and 3.0 vs. 0.6 and 0.5 days for pegfilgrastim 100 microg/kg and filgrastim patients with and without these risk factors, respectively. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (defined as ANC < 0.5 x 10(9)/l and temperature > 38.2degrees C) was low (10% of patients). Pegfilgrastim was well tolerated with a safety profile similar to daily filgrastim. Once per chemotherapy cycle administration of pegfilgrastim was comparable to filgrastim in this clinical setting.
Alertness is a vital function, and medications that do not impair this vital function are clinically desirable in terms of safety. In a comparative study to measure daytime alertness objectively, 60 men and women in good health were assigned to receive either cetirizine, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg, hydroxyzine, 25 mg, or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design. Subjects slept in the laboratory for 2 consecutive nights to facilitate adaptation. During the second night, the subjects' sleep patterns were recorded by electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram, and chin electromyogram. After the second night, subjects were awakened at 7:30 AM and given a single dose of the assigned treatment. Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (standardized 20-minute opportunities to fall asleep in bed while EEG and eye movements are recorded) were given every 2 hours. Subjects who received cetirizine did not differ from control subjects given placebo in any measure of daytime alertness. Subjects who received hydroxyzine were significantly more sedated than were control subjects given placebo for about 4 hours after treatment. The data from this study provide evidence that cetirizine does not differ from placebo with respect to alertness. The usefulness of the specific and sensitive standardized electroencephalogram, compared with alternative assessments of daytime alertness, is discussed.
The current management of early stage Hodgkin's disease (HD) is usually based on clinical staging, combined modality therapy and the use of less toxic chemotherapy regimens. This approach entails high cure rates, while ensures less long term toxicity with avoidance of laparotomy. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a brief course of Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy followed by limited field radiotherapy (RT) in favorable clinical stage (CS) I and IIA HD. Forty patients, aged 17-68 (median 34) years, with favorable CS I and IIA HD, without bulky mediastinal disease, have been treated with 4-6 (median 4) cycles of ABVD plus limited field RT. Twenty seven (67%) patients received 4 cycles of chemotherapy, while 13 received 5-6 cycles. Thirty five (87%) patients received limited field RT with dose 24-36 Gy and five (13%) received extended field with 36-46 Gy. All patients responded completely to chemotherapy. One patient experienced a relapse two months after the end of therapy. All patients are alive; 39 in continuous complete remission. With a median follow-up period of 44 months (range 18-101) the actuarial overall and progress free survival was 100 and 97% at 5 years. We did not observe any case of secondary leukemia or solid tumor. Pulmonary toxicity was mild in cases of mediastinal irradiation. Considering the short follow-up time and the small number of patients, the combination of a brief course of ABVD plus regional RT is a very efficacious treatment of favorable CS I and IIA HD with mild toxicity. However, long term survival data are needed, which could give confident answers regarding the risk of late therapy related complications, particularly second malignancies.
In an effort to investigate the potential antimanic-like activity of K(v)7 channel openers, we decided to test: (1) the subtype non-selective K(v)7 opener retigabine, (2) the K(v)7.4-K(v)7.5 (and K(v)7.5/3 heteromers) preferring channel opener BMS-204352 (Maxipost), and (3) the novel K(v)7.2/3 preferring channel opener ICA-27243, in the amphetamine (AMPH)+chlordiazepoxide (CDP)-induced hyperactivity paradigm in mice, a test often used to assess potential antimanic-like activity of novel compounds. Lithium and lamotrigine were included as positive controls. Pretreatment with lithium attenuated AMPH/CDP-induced hyperactivity, without affecting the activity of AMPH- or CDP-alone, and thus confirmed some predictive validity for the test paradigm. Pretreatment with lamotrigine significantly attenuated AMPH/CDP-induced effects, but also reduced motility when tested in the presence of CDP-alone. Pretreatment with retigabine or ICA-27243 attenuated AMPH/CDP-induced hyperactivity without affecting basal locomotor activity. In contrast, pretreatment with BMS-204352 failed to decrease AMPH/CDP-induced hyperactivity at lower doses (3 and 10 mg/kg). At higher doses BMS-204352 attenuated hyperactivity induced by the AMPH/CDP mix, but only at doses decreasing basal locomotor activity (30 and 60 mg/kg). None of the K(v)7 openers tested significantly affected AMPH-induced hyperactivity. In contrast, retigabine and ICA-27243 were shown to induce significant reductions in motility when administered in combination with CDP-alone. In conclusion, the results with lithium confirm some predictive validity for the test paradigm. However, our data highlight an important confounder for interpreting a role for K(v)7 channels in the alleviation of manic-like symptoms when employing the AMPH/CDP hyperactivity model in mice. It is imperative that relevant control studies (AMPH- and CDP-alone) be incorporated and reported routinely to enable thorough interpretation of data generated by means of this behavioural test.
Verapamil is widely used for the termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) with little proarrhythmic effect. We describe two cases of PSVT that changed to non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia after administration of verapamil. Electrophysiological study revealed atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia in the first case, and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia due to a concealed left lateral accessory pathway in the second case. Catecholamine-induced automaticity was one of the possible mechanisms of VT in the first case, but the mechanism is unknown in the second case.
The incidence of apnoeic episodes (> 12 s) was measured in 30 surgical patients allocated randomly to one of three analgesic regimens and all nursed in a high dependency unit. Ten patients received i.m. morphine (mean 52 (range 30-80) mg), administered on request. The remaining 20 patients received extradural sufentanil as an initial bolus dose of 50 micrograms followed by a bolus of 10 micrograms, either self-administered using PCA (10 patients: mean 275 (range 130-450) micrograms) or administered by a nurse on request (10 patients: 144 (70-200) micrograms). With i.m. morphine apnoeic episodes were maximal 2-3 h after administration while after extradural sufentanil, apnoeas were maximal within a few minutes.
Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, have been available for almost 20 years. Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression, they are associated with acute and chronic nephrotoxicity. Acute nephrotoxicity, which occurs in the early period after transplantation, leads to a higher rate of dialysis, and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss. Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases. Two recently available immunosuppressive agents, mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus (rapamycin), have no nephrotoxicity. The use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy. This paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.
The influence of drugs improving sympathoadrenal system status on natural killer (NK) functional activity was studied in lung cancer patients. The activity of adenosine-metabolizing enzymes (adenosine deaminase and 5'-nucleotidase) in NK cells was found significantly altered, suggesting the involvement of this phenomenon in decreasing NK activity under tumor growth. Pharmacological correction of sympathoadrenal system status was followed by an increase in NK functional activity in lung cancer patients.
Multiple myeloma represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from a single clone. It is well known that alkylating agents are capable of inducing myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myelocytic leukemias (AML). This risk of both diseases in patients with multiple myeloma has been estimated to be 10-20% after 10 years. We aimed to evaluate the time course and the type of genetic abnormalities in melphalan-treated patients in the chronic stage of the disease. We applied fluorescence in situ hybridization methods with probes to 5q31 and 7q31 to mononuclear peripheral blood leukocytes of 18 melphalan-treated patients and compared the results to those of 8 untreated myeloma patients. We found three patients (17%) with a 5q31 deletion in their peripheral white blood cells, but no 7q31 deletion. These findings suggest that 5q- occurs before the overt development of MDS/AML and raise important concerns regarding long-term treatment of myeloma patients with alkylating agents. Also, the performance of cytogenetic evaluation should be considered before autologous transplantation. The clinical and biological implications of these findings should be evaluated in larger clinical and laboratory studies.
A 56-year-old man who received a live-related renal transplant in 1988 was started in 1995 on the selective angiotensin II antagonist losartan (Dupont-Merke) to treat worsening hypertension. Two months later because of pulmonary oedema, loop diuretics were started. Within two weeks, serum creatinine had increased from 245 to 571 mumol/l, and the patient became oliguric. A systolic bruit was noted over the graft. Renal angiography showed a 90% stenosis of the transplant renal artery. Losartan was withdrawn, with prompt improvement in renal function. A successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty performed a few days later resulted in further improvement in renal function accompanied by a significant diuresis.
Our lab has previously shown that when administered acutely, the methylxanthine theophylline can activate a latent respiratory motor pathway to restore function to the hemidiaphragm paralyzed by an ipsilateral C2 spinal cord hemisection. The recovery is mediated by the antagonism of CNS adenosine A1 receptors. The objective of the present study was to assess quantitatively recovery after chronic theophylline administration, the effects of weaning from the drug, and the effects of the drug on adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression in adult rats subjected to a C2 hemisection. Rats subjected to a left C2 hemisection received theophylline orally for 3, 7, 12, or 30 days and were classified as 3D, 7D, 12D, or 30D respectively. Separate groups of 3D animals were weaned from drug administration for 7, 12, and 30 days before assessment of respiratory recovery. Additional groups of 7D and 12D animals were also weaned from drug administration for 7 and 12 days prior to assessment. Sham-operated controls received theophylline vehicle for similar periods. Quantitative assessment of recovered respiratory activity was conducted under standardized electrophysiologic recording conditions approximately 18 h after each drug application period. Serum theophylline analysis was conducted at the end of electrophysiologic recordings. Adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression in the phrenic nucleus was assessed with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Chronic theophylline induced a dose-dependent effect on respiratory recovery over a serum theophylline range of 1.2-1.9 microg/ml. Recovery was characterized as respiratory-related activity in the left phrenic nerve and expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals under similar recording conditions. Recovered activity was 34.13 +/- 2.07, 55.89 +/- 2.96, 74.78 +/- 1.93, and 79.12 +/- 1.75% respectively in the 3D, 7D, 12D, and 30D groups. Theophylline-induced recovered activity persisted for as long as 30 days when drug administration was stopped and serum levels of the drug were virtually undetected. Furthermore, recovered activity in 3D and 7D animals increased significantly as a function of duration of weaning. Adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression was not significantly changed by theophylline administration. It is concluded that recovery of respiratory function in C2-hemisected rats induced by chronic theophylline is unrelated to adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression. Recovered activity persists even when drug administration has been stopped. The significance of our results is that in the clinical application of theophylline to improve respiratory impairment, intermittent drug administration may be sufficient to engender and maintain the therapeutic benefits of the drug.
2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), the most abundant mutagenic heterocyclic amine contained in cooked food, induces colon tumors in F344 male rats when administered orally. In the present study, PhIP was introduced to various rat strains, and susceptibility to the induction of aberrant crypt foci (ACFs) was analyzed as a biomarker for colon carcinogenesis. BUF/Nac rats were highly susceptible, giving rise to 12.2 +/- 1.7 ACFs per rat. F344 rats were intermediate and ACI/N rats were resistant, giving 3.5 +/- 1.8 and 0.9 +/- 0.7 ACFs per rat, respectively. In spite of this, the extent of DNA damage by PhIP in F344, in terms of the level of PhIP-DNA adducts, was significantly lower than that in ACI/N. The differences in formation of ACFs could be, in some part, implicated in the differential susceptibility to colon carcinogenesis induced by PhIP, especially in a step later than adduct formation. In an attempt to determine the genetic factors implicated in the susceptibility to formation of ACFs, a possible involvement of the adenomatous polyposis gene (Apc) and its modifier secretory phospholipase A2 (Pla2g2a) was analyzed. No genetic polymorphisms in either Apc or Pla2g2a showed a significant correlation to susceptibility to formation of ACFs among rat strains.
Diplopia, blurred vision and colour disturbances are well-known side effects associated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue colour test (F-100) is an accepted and sensitive tool to detect changes in colour perception. To determine the impact of AEDs upon colour vision, we evaluated 37 consecutive patients with complex partial seizures exposed to monotherapy with phenytoin (PHT, carbamazepine (CBZ) or valproic acid (VPA). All had normal IQ and no congenital disturbances in colour vision or ocular diseases. Twenty normal controls were used for statistical analysis. Thirteen patients were exposed to PHT, 12 to CBZ and 12 to VPA. Visual colour perception was impaired in 30/37 (82%) of the study group. The most significant abnormality was detected in the blue-yellow axis in 10/13 patients exposed to PHT (p < 0.02) and in 8/12 treated with CBZ (p < 0.009). In 8/12 patients taking VPA, no significant abnormality was observed (p < 0.06). None of the studied patients complained of colour vision disturbances. Our findings strongly support the negative effect of AEDs upon colour vision discrimination, most likely due to changes at the retinal processing level. F-100 proved to be very useful to assess early toxicity due to AEDs.
Opioid overdose is an increasing health problem worldwide. The cardiovascular toxicity of opioids contributes to morbidity and mortality in overdose but the hemodynamic effects of opioids reported in animal and human studies are contradictory.
We performed a prospective observational study of patients admitted to hospital following an overdose of methadone, dihydrocodeine, or low dose paracetamol (10 each). Basic cardiovascular indices including peripheral blood pressure, pulse rate, radial augmentation index and derived measures of aortic systolic, diastolic, pulse, and mean and end systolic pressures were measured every six hours for up to 18-23 hours after exposure or until hospital discharge.
Dihydrocodeine and methadone significantly reduced peripheral and aortic systolic, mean and end systolic pressures. Both opioids significantly decreased peripheral pulse pressure, but only methadone decreased aortic blood pressure. Dihydrocodeine reduced systemic and aortic diastolic blood pressure, an effect not induced by methadone. Methadone significantly reduced peripheral pulse pressure. Augmentation index and heart rate, however, did not change. Both opioids decreased arterial oxygen saturation.
These results suggest that dihydrocodeine and methadone in overdose both have a significant effect on central and peripheral hemodynamics. These effects might be expected to reduce cardiac afterload, providing a pharmacological explanation for the apparent benefit of opioids in cardiovascular diseases.
In previous studies we found that experimental Adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy is associated with the loss of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) anionic sites provided by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Chronic saline loading in normal rats resulted in a similar effect on the GBM anionic sites. The L-arginine-nitric oxide synthase-nitric oxide system is involved in the pathogenesis of experimental chronic renal failure. The present study was performed to determine the combined effect of nitric oxide (NO) modulation and chronic saline loading in ADR nephropathy. The modulation of NO was done by chronic administration of L-arginine (NO donor) or N(w)-nitro-L-arginine, a known nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.
Systolic blood pressure was measured in awake rats by a tail-cuff method. Renal function was assessed by creatinine clearance, FeNa%, and daily protein excretion. The change of mean GBM widths and anionic sites distribution were assessed by electron microscopy. The localization of anionic sites was carried out by cationic colloidal gold. Plasma and urinary nitrates (NO(x)) were measured by nitrite (NO(2)) + nitrate (NO(3)), stable metabolites of NO.
Two weeks after the ADR administration (3.5 mg/kg BW iv) the rats had severe renal failure (creatinine clearance 134 +/- 31 microl/min/100 g BW vs. initial values 670 +/- 29 microl/min/ 100 g BW, p < 0.001), high FeNa%, severe proteinuria, increased GBM width, significant reduction of GBM anionic sites and low urinary NO(x) excretion. The saline loading resulted in further reduction of GBM anionic sites count and blood pressure elevation. The inhibition of NO did not change the course of ADR nephropathy. The main finding of the present study is that chronic administration of L-arginine significantly alleviates the renal failure in the ADR (+/- saline loading) nephropathy. The L-arginine-treated rat had higher creatinine clearance, lower FeNa% and protein excretion and complete normalization of GBM anionic sites distribution.
Sodium loading has a deleterious effect on GBM permselectivity. L-Arginine prevents the reduction of GBM anionic sites, decreases proteinuria and alleviates the renal insufficiency in ADR nephropathy.
Influence of 4,5-dihydro-6-[1-[2-hydroxy-2-(4-cyanophenyl)ethyl]- 1,2,5,6,-tetrahydropyrido-4-yl]pyridazin-3(2H)-one (SCH00013) and vesnarinone (CAS 81840-15-5) on the arrhythmia experimentally induced by three different methods was investigated in dogs. In digitalis-induced arrhythmia, SCH00013 (3 mg/kg i.v.) showed a tendency to improve the arrhythmia with a decrease in the arrhythmic ratio and an increase in the conducted beats (CB), though these changes did not reach a significant level; it decreased significantly the blood pressure (BP) with no change in the total heart rate (THR) and atrial rate (AR). Vesnarinone (3 mg/kg i.v.) did not affect these parameters except for BP that was decreased significantly. In two-stage coronary ligation-induced arrhythmia, SCH00013 (1 and 3 mg/kg i.v.) did not change the arrhythmic ratio, CB, AR and BP, while the THR being slightly decreased; the arrhythmic ratio showed a tendency to decrease with SCH00013 when examined at 24 h after coronary ligation. Vesnarinone (3 mg/kg i.v.) did not affect these parameters at 24 and 48 h after ligation. In epinephrine (adrenaline)-induced arrhythmia, both SCH00013 and vesnarinone showed exacerbation of arrhythmia. SCH00013 at 1 mg/kg i.v. did not elicit ventricular fibrillation (VF) in five dogs examined, but at 3 mg/kg i.v. it elicited VF in two of three dogs. Vesnarinone at 1 mg/kg i.v. induced VF in all of three dogs examined. Incidence of VF induced by optical isomers of SCH00013 was not significantly different from each other: both isomers elicited VF in two of six dogs at 1 mg/kg i.v. and at 3 mg/kg i.v. each of them induced VF in two dogs examined. The present results indicate that SCH00013 is a cardiotonic agent that is equivalent to or less arrhythmogenic than vesnarinone in animal models of arrhythmia, such as adrenaline- and digitalis-induced arrhythmia and the two-stage coronary ligation-induced arrhythmia. Optical isomers of SCH00013 were essentially equieffective in eliciting exacerbation of adrenaline-induced arrhythmia in the dog.
Chronic subcutaneous infusion of ouabain causes hypertension via central pathways involving angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor stimulation. The present study assessed plasma and tissue ANG I and II levels as well as AT1 receptor and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA levels and binding densities by real-time PCR and in vitro autoradiography in relevant brain nuclei and peripheral tissues (heart and kidney) in rats at 1 and/or 2 wk after start of ouabain infusion at 50 microg/day. After 2 wk (but not after 1 wk), blood pressures significantly increased (+15 mmHg). At 2 wk, plasma ANG I and II levels were markedly suppressed by ouabain. In contrast, in the heart and kidneys, ANG I levels were not affected, and ANG II levels tended to decrease, whereas in the hypothalamus ANG II content clearly increased. At 1 wk, no changes in ACE and AT1 receptor densities were seen. After 2 wk, there were significant decreases in AT(1) receptor mRNA and densities in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), subfornical organ (SFO), and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). ACE densities decreased only in the OVLT and SFO, but ACE mRNA showed more variable responses (decrease in OVLT vs. increase in PVN). In the kidneys, at 2 wk both AT1 receptor and ACE densities were decreased, but mRNA abundance did not change. The heart showed no significant changes. The increase in hypothalamic ANG II content and associated decreases in central AT1 receptor and ACE densities support the involvement of the brain renin-angiotensin system in the central hypertensive mechanism of action of ouabain.
Cortical tubular necrosis induced by either aspirin (300 mg/kg) or oxyphenbutazone (444 mg/kg) was reduced if probenecid (300 mg/kg) was administered at the same time. The prior administration of aspirin (600 mg/kg) reduced the tubular necrosis that follows administration of oxyphenbutazone (444 mg/kg) alone, thus demonstrating that some degree of cross-tolerance between the two drugs occurs. Phenacetin pretreatment (597 mg/kg) was less effective, while paracetamol (503 mg/kg) was without effect in this regard. Those substances that reduced the oxyphenbutazone-induced cortical lesion also ameliorated the focal degenerative change in the lower nephron attributed to this drug. Oral administration of 2:4 dinitrophenol (20 mg/kg) led to only minor cortical tubular necrosis in a few animals.
The syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) is an inherited form of human hypertension thought to result from a deficiency of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta HSD). This enzyme normally converts cortisol to inactive cortisone and is postulated to thus confer specificity for aldosterone upon the mineralocorticoid receptor. We have analysed the gene encoding the kidney isozyme of 11 beta HSD and found mutations on both alleles in nine of 11 AME patients (eight of nine kindreds). These mutations markedly affect enzymatic activity. They thus permit cortisol to occupy the renal mineralocorticoid receptor and thereby cause sodium retention and hypertension.
Isocyanate-induced asthma, the most commonly reported cause of occupational asthma, has been difficult to diagnose and control, in part, because the biological mechanisms responsible for the disease and the determinants of exposure have been difficult to define. Appropriate animals models of isocyanate asthma will be instrumental to further our understanding of this disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that dermal exposure to isocyanates in mice results in systemic sensitization that leads to eosinophilic airways inflammation upon subsequent airway challenge. We hypothesized that inhalation of vapor phase toluene diisocyante (TDI) will lead to immunologic sensitization in mice and that subsequent challenge will induce pathology and immune system alterations indicative of asthma found in humans. To determine the impact of exposure dose as well as the involvement of immune (allergic) or nonimmune mechanisms, a murine model of TDI asthma was established and characterized following either low-level subchronic or high-dose acute inhalation TDI exposure. C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to TDI by inhalation either subchronically for 6 weeks (20 ppb, 4 h/day, 5 days/week) or by a 2-h acute exposure at 500 ppb. Both groups were challenged 14 days later via inhalation with 20 ppb TDI for 1 h. Mice that underwent the subchronic exposure regimen demonstrated a marked allergic response evidenced by increases in airway inflammation, eosinophilia, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial cell alterations, airway hyperreponsiveness (AHR), T(H)1/T(H)2 cytokine expression in the lung, elevated levels of serum IgE, and TDI-specific IgG antibodies, as well as the ability to transfer these pathologies to naive mice with lymphocytes or sera from TDI exposed mice. In contrast, mice that received acute TDI exposure demonstrated increased AHR, specific IgG antibodies, and pathology in the lung consistent with asthma, but without the presence of elevated serum IgE, lung eosionophilia, or increased expression of T(H) cytokines. These results describe mouse models for TDI asthma consistent with that found in workers with occupational asthma and indicate that the pulmonary pathology associated with TDI can vary depending upon the exposure paradigm.
A continuous infusion of 0.25% bupivaciane into the parevertebral space was used for postoperative pain relief after a lung resection. On postoperative day 1, a brachial plexus palsy developed, which resolved on discontinuation of the infusion. We believe this rare complication has not been reported previously. Awareness of this possibility may avoid unnecessary investigations.
Isocyanate-induced asthma, which is the most common type of occupational asthma, has been difficult to diagnose and control, in part, because the biological mechanisms responsible for the disease and the determinants of exposure are not fully defined. To help address these issues, we recently established a murine model of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) asthma using inhalation exposure paradigms consistent with potential workplace exposure. In order to confirm our hypothesis that TDI-induce asthma, like allergic asthma, is predominantly a Th2 response, the ability of mice that were deficient in CD4 or CD8 cells or specific Th1 and Th2 cytokines to develop TDI asthma was examined. The development of allergic asthma was evaluated by monitoring lungs for the presence of eosinophilia, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial cell alterations, airway hyperreactivity (AHR), and Th2 and Th1 cytokine expression, as well as serum IgE levels and TDI-specific IgG antibodies. Transgenic CD8 or CD4 knockout (KO) mice exhibited significant reductions in AHR, cytokine expression, serum antibody levels, airway inflammation, and histopathological lesions, although in a number of the endpoints the effects were more attenuated in CD4 KO mice. IFNgamma depletion ablated the increase in AHR in TDI-allergic mice, but had only slight to moderate effects on airway histopathology, serum antibody levels, and cytokine expression compared to sensitized/challenged controls. IL-4 and IL-13 deficiency had moderate inhibitory effects, while combined IL-4/IL-13 depletion effectively prevented almost all asthma-associated pathologies. Taken together, these results indicate that TDI asthma, like immune-mediated asthma produced by large-molecular-weight materials, is driven primarily by CD4+ T cells and is dependent upon the expression of Th2 cytokines. However, as with protein-induced asthma models, certain pathologies are influenced by CD8+ T cells and Th1-derived cytokines, such as AHR and cytokine production.
