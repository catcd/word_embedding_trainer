The injection of retrobulbar block is associated with significant pain and discomfort. Therefore a short-acting IV analgesic before retrobulbar injection has been advocated.
To compare remifentanil, alfentanil and fentanyl in providing analgesia for retrobulbar block injection.
69 patients were enrolled randomly into three groups of 23 each to receive either Remifentanil 1 microg/kg, Alfentanil 20 microg/kg or Fentanyl 2 microg/kg as an IV bolus dose prior to retrobulbar injection. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded and Numerical Pain Score (NPS) were assessed by a blinded observer.
Remifentanil prevented increase in MAP and HR while alfentanil and fentanyl were ineffective in this purpose (p < 0.05). NPS was significantly lower in remifentanil group (p < 0.05).
Remifentanil 1 microg/kg prior to retrobulbar injection provide excellent hemodynamic stability and ensure analgesia.
The effects of 21 cationized serum albumin samples of various degrees of cationization on renal function were studied in the dog. The samples were perfused intra- aortically to obtain preferential perfusion of the left kidney in 25 dogs. Standard clearance techniques were used, associated in six dogs with sieving studies of 125I-labelled polyvinylpyrrolidone (125I-PVP) and with an extensive morphological study in 15 dogs. Renal effects were observed. (a) Renal effects in left kidneys. The perfusion with weakly cationized albumin (group 1) produced moderate proteinuria associated with the deposition of cationized albumin on the anionic sites of the basement membrane. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unaltered. Perfusion with highly cationized samples (group 2) produced more severe proteinuria and a significant decrease in GFR. Glomerular permeability to 125I-PVP increased. Perfusion with the four samples of highest pI (group 3) was followed by anuria. (b) Renal effects in right kidneys. A retarded mild proteinuria appeared only in group 2 and group 3 animals without alteration of GFR. All the kidneys (group 1 included), with the exception of two (group 3), showed deposition of the protein in the anionic sites. The following extrarenal effects were observed essentially in group 2 and group 3 animals: erythrocyte agglutination and haemolysis, platelet aggregation and thrombocytopenia, and a decrease in plasma fibrogen level due to fibrinogen precipitation. These effects produced progressive obstruction in the glomerular capillaries, thus explaining the occurrence of anuria. The structural damage in group 2 and group 3 left kidneys bears remarkable resemblance to that observed in the fulminant form of the human so-called 'haemolytic-uraemic syndrome'. The neutralization alone of the fixed negative charges in the glomerular wall appears to produce only mild proteinuria, whereas the various extrarenal effects combine to produce more severe proteinuria associated with functional alteration and vascular obstruction.
Nuclear receptor-binding SET domain-containing protein 1 (NSD1) gene mutations and deletions (NSD1+/-) are the major cause of Sotos syndrome. The aim was to investigate which auxology parameters relate to NSD1+/- in patients clinically suspected of Sotos syndrome.
In 32 patients clinically suspected of Sotos syndrome, we compared auxology parameters between NSD1+/- patients and patients without NSD1 gene alterations (NSD1+/+). The statistical performance of these parameters to predict NSD1+/- was assessed.
Arm span-for-height standard deviation score (SDS) and hand length SDS were significantly higher in NSD1+/- patients.
Arm span for height and hand length are discriminating parameters between NSD1+/- and NSD1+/+.
Clioquinol, a Cu²⁺/Zn²⁺/Fe²⁺ chelator/ionophor, was used extensively in the mid 1900s as an amebicide for treating indigestion and diarrhea. It was eventually withdrawn from the market because of a link to subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) in Japan. The pathogenesis of SMON, however, is not fully understood. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of clioquinol-induced neurotoxicity, a global analysis using DNA chips was carried out on human neuroblastoma cells. The global analysis and quantitative PCR demonstrated that mRNA levels of p21(Cip1), an inhibitor of cyclins D and E, and of GADD45α, a growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein, were significantly increased by clioquinol treatment in SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells. Activation of p53 by clioquinol was suggested, since clioquinol induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 to enhance its stabilization. The phosphorylation of p53 was inhibited by KU-55933, an inhibitor of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), but not by NU7026, an inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Clioquinol in fact induced phosphorylation of ATM and histone H2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). These results suggest that clioquinol-induced neurotoxicity is mediated by DSBs and subsequent activation of ATM/p53 signaling.
Patients with early breast cancer who receive anthracycline-containing chemotherapy experience improved relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with those who receive non-anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Such benefit, however, may be restricted to women whose tumors have specific molecular characteristics. We tested the hypothesis that HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr)/HER1, HER3, Ki67, and topoisomerase IIalpha expression are predictive of outcome after anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
Tissue microarrays from 322 of 374 women in the BR9601 trial, which compared cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) with epirubicin followed by CMF (epi-CMF), were analyzed for HER1, 2, 3, 4; Ki67; and topoisomerase IIalpha protein expression and for HER2/topoisomerase IIalpha gene amplification. Their relationships to RFS and OS were investigated, and multiple regression analysis was used to identify interactions.
A significant interaction was seen between tumors with normal HER1, HER2 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), or HER3 levels and the enhanced benefit from epi-CMF versus CMF for RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; HR for overexpressed HER1 or HER2 FISH or HER3, 0.92; P = .035) and for OS (HR, 0.30; HR for overexpressed HER1 or HER2 FISH or HER3), 0.98; P = .023). Neither Ki67 nor TIIalpha expressions or gene alterations showed clear predictive value for benefit from the addition of the anthracycline.
Patients with HER2 amplified and those with HER1, HER2 FISH, or HER3-positive tumors did not benefit from the addition of epirubicin to CMF. Conversely, patients with HER2 nonamplified and HER1 through HER3-negative tumors showed significantly increased RFS and OS rates when treated with epi-CMF compared with CMF.
1. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced hypertension is associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency and increased oxidative stress. Atorvastatin (Ato), an HMG-Co-enzyme-A reductase inhibitor has been reported to enhance availability of NO. The aim of the study was to assess whether pretreatment with Ato would prevent the development of ACTH-induced hypertension and whether established ACTH-induced hypertension could be reversed with subsequent administration of Ato in rats. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 60) were treated with Ato (30 mg/kg per day in drinking water) or tap water for 15 days. ACTH (0.2 mg/kg per day s.c) or saline was started 4 days after Ato treatment or non-treated rats and continued for 11-13 days (prevention study). In the reversal study, Ato was given on day 8 of ACTH/Saline treatment for 5 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured on alternate days using the tail cuff method. 3. Adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment increased SBP (110 +/- 2-136 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.001) and aortic superoxide production (P < 0.001). Ato alone did not alter SBP, but Ato pretreatment prevented ACTH-induced hypertension compared with that in rats treated with ACTH alone (118 +/- 2 and 136 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively, P cent < 0.01). Ato partially reversed ACTH-induced hypertension (124 +/- 3 and 136 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively, P cent < 0.05). Plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) was decreased in ACTH-treated rats compared with saline treated rats (6.6 +/- 0.4 saline and 4.5 +/- 0.5 micromol/L ACTH, P < 0.001). Atorvastatin affected neither plasma NOx nor aortic superoxide production. 4. Atorvastatin prevented and partially reversed ACTH-induced hypertension in the rat.
Lidocaine was administered intravenously as a substitute for diazepam, to 12 patients with status epilepticus or clustering seizures aged 26 days to 11 years. The medication was very effective in 3 cases with acute convulsions, which disappeared immediately after infusion of lidocaine without relapse. The medication was effective only temporarily in 4 patients; they experienced relapsing seizures during drip infusion of lidocaine intravenously for maintenance. All the relapsing seizures were secondarily generalized ones with diffuse ictal discharges. In 2 cases of localization-related epilepsy, complex partial seizures evolved to secondarily generalized seizures immediately after administration of lidocaine. It must be noticed that in a relatively large number of cases lidocaine is ineffective or even harmful.
The new low-osmolar contrast agent ioversol was compared with the conventional ionic contrast agent diatrizoate in 60 patients undergoing routine abdominal (21 patients) and peripheral (39 patients) arteriography. The effects on hemodynamics, various laboratory parameters, and patient comfort were evaluated. In peripheral arteriography, there was less discomfort with ioversol as well as decreased magnitude and incidence of hypotension (P less than .001) after injection. In visceral arteriography, there was no significant difference between the two agents. Overall, the incidence of ECG changes was small in both groups (ioversol 2%, diatrizoate 8%). The two media were equivalent in incidence of adverse reactions (eg, nausea, vomiting, urticaria), the effect on laboratory parameters, and in the diagnostic adequacy of the radiographs. We conclude that ioversol is safe and efficacious for peripheral and visceral arteriography. In peripheral arteriography it causes less patient discomfort and, perhaps more importantly, fewer hemodynamic alterations than diatrizoate. These differences in hemodynamic effects may be important in patients with hemodynamic instability or limited cardiovascular reserve.
Eight patients developed grand mal seizures during intravenous theophylline therapy. None had a history of neurologic disorder, and all were acutely ill with severe pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, or both. Serum theophylline concentrations obtained within 1 hour of the seizure ranged from 25 mug/ml to 70mug/ml, with a mean value (53 plus or minus 4.8 mug/ml) more than twice the upper limit of the recommended therapeutic concentration. This serum theophylline concentration was greater than the concentration found in a group of patients with less severe drug-related symptoms (35 plus or minus 1.8 mug/ml, P less than 0.01). A third group of patients without drug-related symptoms had a mean theophylline serum concentration of 19 plus or minus 2.0 mug/ml, which was less than that found in either group with toxicity symptoms (P less than 0.05). Factors predisposing to the high serum concentrations in the patients with seizures were both higher drug dosage, compared with the other groups (P less than 0.01), and hepatic dysfunction, which was more common in both groups with drug-related symptoms.
Based on epidemiological data, chronic exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic in drinking water is carcinogenic to humans, inducing skin, urinary bladder and lung tumors. In vivo, inorganic arsenic is metabolized to organic methylated arsenicals including the highly toxic dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)) and monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)). Short-term treatment of rats with 100 microg/g trivalent arsenic (As(III)) as sodium arsenite in the diet or in drinking water induced cytotoxicity and necrosis of the urothelial superficial layer, with increased cell proliferation and hyperplasia. The objectives of this study were to determine if these arsenic-induced urothelial effects are dose responsive, the dose of arsenic at which urothelial effects are not detected, and the urinary concentrations of the arsenical metabolites. We treated female F344 rats for 5 weeks with sodium arsenite at dietary doses of 0, 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 ppm. Cytotoxicity, cell proliferation and hyperplasia of urothelial superficial cells were increased in a dose-responsive manner, with maximum effects found at 50 ppm As(III). There were no effects at 1 ppm As(III). The main urinary arsenical in As(III)-treated rats was the organic arsenical dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)). The thio-metabolites dimethylmonothioarsinic acid (DMMTA(V)) and monomethylmonothioarsinic acid (MMMTA(V)) were also found in the urine of As(III)-treated rats. The LC(50) concentrations of DMMTA(V) for rat and human urothelial cells in vitro were similar to trivalent oxygen-containing arsenicals. These data suggest that dietary As(III)-induced urothelial cytotoxicity and proliferation are dose responsive, and the urothelial effects have a threshold corresponding to the urinary excretion of measurable reactive metabolites.
Craniofacial malformations cause great human suffering. The purpose of the experimental studies was to investigate teratogenically induced craniofacial malformations in the rat, and to study if vitamin B6 could prevent the teratogenically induced malformations in the rat. The aim of the clinical investigation was to compare mandibulofacial dysostosis (MFD) with hemifacial microsomia (HFM) and thalidomide-induced malformations restricted to the first and second branchial arches. In the experimental studies we used two different teratogenic agents, etretinate and BAPN (beta-aminoproprionitrile). Vitamin B6 was administered one day prior to and simultaneously with the teratogenic agent. The induced malformations were observed by direct microscopy, histology, differential staining, microdissection and enzyme histochemistry. Knowledge of isoenzymic differentiation was obtained by isoelectric focusing and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The clinical features of 29 patients with MFD, 26 with HFM and seven with thalidomide-induced malformations were investigated. The patients underwent clinical investigations, radiography, tomography, computed tomography, surgical exploration and audiograms. The etretinate-induced syndrome in the rat shows similarities to first and second branchial arch syndromes in man. Defective formation of Meckel's cartilage and the cartilaginous skull base, the zygoma and the middle ear ossicles were prominent features of the observed malformations. The induced malformations were accompanied by increased staining for alkaline phosphatase (APase) in the skull and skull base cartilages and Meckel's cartilage. BAPN induced cleft palate in 95% of the cases and the teratogenically induced cleft palate was accompanied by a pathological differentiation pattern that could be traced by determination of isoenzymes in the palatal shelves as well as in amniotic fluid. Vitamin B6 could prevent the teratogenic malformations induced by etretinate and BAPN in the rat. Comparing MFD, HFM and thalidomide-induced malformations, all syndromes included patients with external, middle and inner ear malformations. Cranial nerve palsy/paresis was only seen in HFM and thalidomide-induced malformations. A relationship between disturbed neural crest cell migration and defects of the first and second branchial arches seems possible.
Dithiocarbamates (DTCs) are a class of compounds that are extensively used in agriculture as pesticides. As such, humans and wildlife are undoubtedly exposed to these chemicals. Although DTCs are thought to be relatively safe due to their short half lives, it is well established that they are teratogenic to vertebrates, especially to fish. In zebrafish, these teratogenic effects are characterized by distorted notochord development and shortened anterior to posterior axis. DTCs are known copper (Cu) chelators but this does not fully explain the observed teratogenic effects. We show here that DTCs cause malformations in zebrafish that highly resemble teratogenic effects observed by direct inhibition of a group of cuproenzymes termed lysyl oxidases (LOX). Additionally, we demonstrate that partial knockdown of three LOX genes, lox, loxl1 and loxl5b, sensitizes the developing embryo to DTC exposure. Finally, we show that DTCs directly inhibit zebrafish LOX activity in an ex vivo amine oxidase assay. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that DTC induced teratogenic effects are, at least in part, caused by direct inhibition of LOX activity.
This study sought to elucidate serial changes in microvascular integrity during papaverine-induced hyperemia in the risk area for myocardial infarction. In addition, we attempted to determine the optimal time for predicting myocardial viability. Seventy-two patients who underwent serial myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) before and shortly after (day 1), 1 day (day 2), and 3 weeks (day 21) after recanalization were studied. In 18 of 72 patients, MCE was performed at baseline and during hyperemia using selective intracoronary infusion of papaverine. Both the peak grayscale ratio (PGSR) within the risk area, and the no- and low-reflow ratio (LR ratio) were analyzed in each stage. Left ventricular regional wall motion (RWM) was determined 6 months after recanalization. The correlation coefficient between PGSR with papaverine on day 1 and that on day 2 was 0.54 (p = 0.02); it was 0.50 (p = 0.04) between day 1 and day 21, and 0.82 (p = 0.001) between day 2 and day 21. On day 1, the correlation coefficient between the LR ratio with papaverine and RWM was 0.60 (p = 0.02), which changed to 0.72 (p = 0.003) on day 2 and 0.54 (p = 0.04) on day 21, respectively. The best time to predict viable myocardium was established on day 2 by receiver operating characteristics curves. ST-segment re-elevation, elapsed time from onset to recanalization, and antecedent angina pectoris were independent factors for PGSR on day 2 using stepwise and multiple linear regression analysis. This study suggests that the optimal time to estimate microvascular integrity for predicting myocardial viability might be 1 day after recanalization, which is neither shortly after recanalization nor during the convalescent stage.
Cyclophosphamide and its derivatives induce hemorrhagic cystitis. A substantial number of patients receive bladder augmentation or replacements using bowel. If patients who have undergone colocystoplasty need treatment with cyclophosphamide before or after the operation, does hemorrhagic cystitis develop? We evaluated the histological changes produced in the colon wall and bladder related to cyclophosphamide and its derivatives in rats that underwent colocystoplasty.
Sprague-Dawley rats of each sex were grouped according to whether they received a single 200 mg./kg. dose of cyclophosphamide, underwent colocystoplasty, underwent each technique or served as controls. The technique of colocystoplasty was the same in all groups. Results were analyzed according to previously reported criteria, by the gross appearance of the bladder and colon segment used for colocystoplasty, and by histological changes.
Two weeks after surgery colocystoplasty had not resulted in secondary changes in the implanted colon segment or original bladder, while there were only nonspecific changes of an inflammatory type in the anastomotic area. After cyclophosphamide administration the animals lost considerable weight and in the bladder area we observed hemorrhagic cystitis that was greater in males than in females, and greater in isolated bladder than when the bladder was sutured to the colon segment. In the colon there was no inflammation or hemorrhage damage of the hemorrhagic cystitis type in the bladder. A total of 12 days after colocystoplasty there were no secondary histological changes except in the anastomotic area. A single 200 mg./kg. dose of cyclophosphamide caused substantial weight loss and hemorrhagic cystitis. Cystitis was quantitatively greater in males than in females and greater in isolated bladder than in bladder anastomosed to the colon.
Administering a single dose of cyclophosphamide did not result in lesions in the colon segment used for colocystoplasty analogous to those of the bladder, such as hemorrhagic cystitis.
Extradural lidocaine exerts several adverse effects which are seldom fatal. While cardiac arrest following extradural lidocaine injection has been reported in human beings, it has not hitherto been reported in dogs.
The emergency management of a dog with complete urethral obstruction is described. We intended to perform vaginoscopy and cystostomy under extradural lidocaine anaesthesia, but cardiac asystole occurred a few minutes after injection. Resuscitation was successful. About 20 minutes later cardiac arrest recurred, and was treated successfully. The dog remained hypothermic for approximately 7 hours. Complete recovery without neurological deficit occurred the next day and the dog remained normal for at least 3 months. The probable cause of the problem was cranial lidocaine dispersion causing a drop in cardiac preload and cardiac arrest. The successful neurological outcome was attributed to early diagnosis and effective treatment. Hypothermia may have conferred cerebral protection during ischemia.
Extradural local anaesthetic administration is not without risk and the technique should be tailored to individual animals. Constant monitoring is required to detect potentially fatal complications and increase the likelihood of successful outcome.
To study the effect of WeiJia on chronic liver injury using carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) induced liver injury animal model.
Wistar rats weighing 180-220g were randomly divided into three groups: normal control group (Group A), CCl(4) induced liver injury control group (Group B) and CCl(4) induction with WeiJia treatment group (Group C). Each group consisted of 14 rats. Liver damage and fibrosis was induced by subcutaneous injection with 40% CCl(4) in olive oil at 3 mL/kg body weight twice a week for eight weeks for Groups B and C rats whereas olive oil was used for Group A rats. Starting from the third week, Group C rats also received daily intraperitoneal injection of WeiJia at a dose of 1.25 microg/kg body weight. Animals were sacrificed at the fifth week (4 male, 3 female), and eighth week (4 male, 3 female) respectively. Degree of fibrosis were measured and serological markers for liver fibrosis and function including hyaluronic acid (HA), type IV collagen (CIV), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined. Alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry were also performed.
CCl(4) induction led to the damage of liver and development of fibrosis in Group B and Group C rats when compared to Group A rats. The treatment of WeiJia in Group C rats could reduce the fibrosis condition significantly compared to Group B rats. The effect could be observed after three weeks of treatment and was more obvious after eight weeks of treatment. Serum HA, CIV, ALT, AST and gamma-GT levels after eight weeks of treatment for Group C rats were 58+/-22 microg/L (P<0.01), 57+/-21 microg/L (P<0.01), 47+/-10 U/L (P<0.01), 139+/-13 U/L (P<0.05) and 52+/-21 U/L (P>0.05) respectively, similar to normal control group (Group A), but significantly different from CCl(4) induced liver injury control group (Group B). An increase in PCNA and decrease in alpha-SMA expression level was also observed.
WeiJia could improve liver function and reduce liver fibrosis which might be through the inhibition of stellate cell activity.
To study the effects of interleukin-10 (IL-10) on the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), nuclear factor- kappa B(NF- kappa B) and Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) in hepatic stellate cells of experimental rats with hepatic fibrosis.
Sixty clean SD rats were randomly divided into control group (group N), liver fibrotic group (group C) and IL-10 treatment group (group I). Control group received intraperitoneal injection of saline (2 mL/kg), twice a week. Fibrotic group was injected intraperitoneally with 50% carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) (2 mL/kg), twice a week. IL-10 treatment group was given IL-10 at a dose of 4 microg/kg 20 minutes before CCl(4) administration from the third week. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were isolated from these rats at the seventh and eleventh weeks during the course of liver fibrosis, respectively. The expression of alpha-SMA and NF- kappa B in HSCs was measured by S-P immunohistochemistry. The expression of Fas and FasL mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. Furthermore, liver tissues were harvested from three groups at the same time.
The CCl(4)- induced experimental rat hepatic fibrosis model was established successfully. The purity of extracted hepatic stellate cells was about 95% and the yield of hepatic stellate cells was 1.2-2.3 x 10(6)/g liver tissue averagely. The positive expression of alpha-SMA and NF- kappa B was 36.5% and 28.5% respectively in group N. The positive levels of alpha-SMA and NF- kappa B were increased significantly in group C compared to group N (P<0.01). The positive signals decreased significantly (P<0.05) in group I. In the 11th week, the HSCs of group I became round with visible pyknotic nuclei. The expression of NF- kappa B in group C was significantly increased in a time-dependent manner (P<0.01), but there was no difference in the alpha-SMA expression (P>0.05). The mRNA of Fas and FasL in group C was significantly increased in a time-dependent manner compared to that in control group. After treated with IL-10, the expression level of Fas and FasL was higher in group I than in group C.
The positive expression of alpha-SMA and NF- kappa B in hepatic stellate cells is decreased by ectogenic IL-10 in liver fibrosis induced by CCl(4). The expression of Fas and FasL is increased in the course of liver fibrosis, and is further increased by IL-10. IL-10 could inhibit the activation of HSCs and cause apoptosis of activated HSCs.
Exposure to organochlorines has been examined as a potential risk factor for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with inconsistent results that may be related to limited statistical power or to imprecise exposure measurements.
Our purpose was to examine associations between organochlorine concentrations in prediagnostic adipose tissue samples and the risk of NHL.
We conducted a case–cohort study using a prospective Danish cohort of 57,053 persons enrolled between 1993 and 1997. Within the cohort we identified 256 persons diagnosed with NHL in the population-based nationwide Danish Cancer Registry and randomly selected 256 subcohort persons. We measured concentrations of 8 pesticides and 10 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in adipose tissue collected upon enrollment. Associations between the 18 organochlorines and NHL were analyzed in Cox regression models, adjusting for body mass index.
Incidence rate ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for interquartile range increases in concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichlorethane (DDT), cis-nonachlor, and oxychlordane were 1.35 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.66), 1.13 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.36), and 1.11 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.38), respectively, with monotonic dose–response trends for DDT and cis-nonachlor based on categorical models. The relative risk estimates were higher for men than for women. In contrast, no clear association was found between NHL and PCBs.
We found a higher risk of NHL in association with higher adipose tissue levels of DDT, cis-nonachlor, and oxychlordane, but no association with PCBs. This is the first study of organochlorines and NHL using prediagnostic adipose tissue samples in the exposure assessment and provides new environmental health evidence that these organochlorines contribute to NHL risk.
To determine the safety and efficacy of a new gel formulation of podofilox in the treatment of anogenital warts.
Double-blind, randomized, multicenter, vehicle-controlled investigation.
Private dermatology practices, university clinics (dermatology, gynecology, and infectious diseases), and contract research organizations.
Three hundred twenty-six patients with anogenital warts.
Number of patients with clearing of all treated warts (treatment success).
The 0.5% podofilox gel was significantly better than vehicle gel for successfully eliminating and reducing the number and size of anogenital warts. In the intent-to-treat population, 62 (37.1%) of 167 patients treated with 0.5% podofilox gel had complete clearing of the treated areas (treatment successes) compared with 2 (2.3%) of 86 patients who had clearing of warts with the vehicle gel (P < .001) after 4 weeks. Nineteen additional patients treated with 0.5% podofilox gel and 2 patients treated with vehicle gel had clearing of warts with continued treatment up to 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, 35.9% of the baseline anogenital warts treated with 0.5% podofilox gel remained; this was significantly fewer than in the vehicle-treated group (88.4% of the baseline number) (P = .001). The 0.5% podofilox gel was generally well tolerated, with predominantly mild or moderate local adverse reactions occurring in the majority of patients. Only 7 patients (3.2%), all receiving 0.5% podofilox gel, discontinued study treatment because of drug-related local reactions.
The results demonstrated that 0.5% podofilox gel is safe and significantly more effective than vehicle gel in the treatment of anogenital warts.
Troglitazone is one of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of anti-diabetic drugs and a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Troglitazone and other PPARgamma ligands have been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest in a variety of cancer cells, and have been considered as potential tumor preventive and tumor therapeutic agents. Little is known, however, about how normal or initiated cells respond to these agents during mouse skin carcinogenesis. We report here that troglitazone and another TZD, ciglitazone, dramatically inhibited mitogen-induced cellular proliferation in normal mouse skin primary keratinocytes and in the C50 keratinocyte cell line. This was accompanied by induction of cell cycle G1 phase arrest and suppression of cyclin D1, cdk4, and cdk2 expression. Troglitazone suppressed cyclin D1 expression at multiple levels. In addition, we demonstrated that PPARgamma was not expressed at functional levels in cultured mouse skin keratinocytes, and that the inhibitory effects of troglitazone on cellular proliferation and cyclin D1 expression in these cells were PPARgamma-independent. Given the important role of keratinocyte proliferation in skin carcinogenesis, our data suggest that TZD may be useful tumor preventive agents in skin.
We present the confusing sonographic features of periportal fibrosis in two AIDS patients who had zidovudine-induced transfusion siderosis of the liver. To our knowledge this has not been previously reported in the literature. The clinical, pathological and sonographic features are described.
Lithium (Li) has been previously reported to increase acetylcholine turnover and release in rat brain and to potentiate the neurotoxicity of cholinergic agents. We studied the effect of chronic Li administration, alone and in combination with the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine, on two cholinergically-mediated responses and on muscarinic cholinergic receptor (MCR) binding in rat brain. Administered separately, Li and scopolamine enhanced the cataleptic and hypothermic responses to pilocarpine; combined administration resulted in an additive effect on both these measures. [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) binding was increased by Li in the corpus striatum but not in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Scopolamine increased [3H]QNB binding in the striatum, cortex and hippocampus; Li and scopolamine effects on striatal MCR were not additive. Contrary to a previous report, antagonist-induced MCR supersensitivity was not prevented by concurrent Li administration in any of the brain areas studied. The additive effect of Li and scopolamine on pilocarpine-induced catalepsy and a trend in this direction for pilocarpine-induced hypothermia suggest that the actions of the two agents to enhance cholinergically mediated responses may be achieved by different mechanisms. Supersensitive responses following scopolamine may be attributed to antagonist-induced up-regulation of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors as demonstrated in the binding studies. The effects of Li to enhance cholinergically-mediated catalepsy and hypothermia are interpreted as extending previous reports that Li stimulates brain cholinergic function by a presynaptic increase in acetylcholine turnover and release.
Mice with targeted disruptions in Hox genes have been generated to evaluate the role of the Hox complex in determining the mammalian body plan. This complex of 38 genes encodes transcription factors that specify regional information along the embryonic axes. Early in vertebrate evolution an ancestral complex shared with invertebrates was duplicated twice to give rise to the four linkage groups (Hox A, B, C and D). As a consequence, corresponding genes on the separate linkage groups, called paralogues, are most closely related to each other. Based on sequence similarities, the Hox genes have been subdivided into 13 paralogous groups. The five most 5' groups (Hox 9-13) pattern the posterior region of the vertebrate embryo and the appendicular skeleton. Mice with individual mutations in the paralogous genes hoxa-11 and hoxd-11 have been described. By breeding these two strains together we have generated double mutants which have dramatic phenotypes not apparent in mice homozygous for the individual mutations. The radius and the ulna of the forelimb are almost entirely eliminated, the axial skeleton shows homeotic transformations, and there are severe kidney defects not present in either single mutant. The limb and axial phenotypes are quantitative: as more mutant alleles are added to the genotype, the phenotype becomes progressively more severe. The appendicular skeleton defects suggest that paralogous Hox genes function together to specify limb outgrowth and patterning along the proximodistal axis.
To explore whether lithium exacerbates neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the authors prospectively rated 10 patients on neuroleptics before and after the addition of lithium. EPS ratings increased steadily after the initiation of lithium and were significantly elevated compared with baseline. Individual items that increased significantly were: gait, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, and tremor. These findings indicate that usual therapeutic levels of lithium may significantly worsen neuroleptic-induced EPS. Potential mechanisms for this interaction are discussed.
