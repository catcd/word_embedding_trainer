Vindesine, a new vinca alkaloid, was administered to 20 patients with advanced refractory breast cancer in a phase II trial. The drug was given at a dose of 3 mg/m2 by iv bolus each week for 6 consecutive weeks, and responding patients were maintained on a dose of 4 mg/m2 every 2 weeks. Nineteen patients were evaluable for disease response; partial remissions were obtained in five patients, for a response rate of 26%. Leukopenia was the major dose-limiting toxic reaction, but most patients were able to tolerate this schedule without difficulty. Neurotoxicity was mild and did not require dose reduction.
The influence of the concentration and time of exposure to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum on the inhibition of the clonogenic growth of three N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide mouse bladder tumor cell lines was evaluated in a tumor colony assay. Drug testing was performed in the murine model, and tumor cells were removed from the animals for in vitro testing. Murine drug testing revealed marked cis-diamminedichloroplatinum sensitivity of all three mouse bladder tumor lines. One-hr incubation in cis-diamminedichloroplatinum was an adequate time of drug exposure to produce in vitro colony survival curves predictive of in vivo sensitivity to the drug. Furthermore, it was found that 6- to greater than 24-hr exposure to the drug was required to produce colony survival curves in the tumor colony assay predictive of tumor sensitivity. High drug concentrations using 1-hr drug incubation or continuous incubation in drug both produced colony survival curves predictive of tumor sensitivity. Both methods, however, would require higher products of the drug concentration multiplied by time curves than could theoretically be clinically achievable in the murine model. Until pharmacokinetic data on cis-diamminedichloroplatinum are available in this murine model, higher drug sensitivity boundaries than are presently being used for other chemotherapeutic agents will have to be utilized when testing these mouse bladder tumor cell lines for their sensitivity to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum in a tumor colony assay.
To describe a case of a patient who became comatose after taking an overdose of duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.
A 49-year-old male ingested an overdose of duloxetine approximately 2 hours before presentation to the emergency department. On arrival he was drowsy, but easily awakened and oriented, with Glasgow Coma Score 14 (eyes 3, motor 6, verbal 5). Immediately after admission, charcoal and magnesium sulfate were given to prevent further systemic absorption of medication through the gastrointestinal tract. No gastric lavage was performed. Six hours after drug intake the patient became unconscious (Glasgow Coma Score 7, eyes 2, motor 4, verbal 1). Full toxicologic screening showed a toxic duloxetine plasma concentration of 0.86 mg/L. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and, on arrival, urinary retention was noted. During ICU admission the patient remained hemodynamically stable; approximately 12 hours after ingestion of duloxetine, he regained consciousness. Over the next 3 days the urinary output decreased to 60 mL/day. After 4 days patient was discharged without any remaining symptoms. Based on repeated plasma duloxetine serum concentration determinations, a plasma half-life of duloxetine was calculated to be 18 hours (reference range 9-19).
The Naranjo probability scale suggested that duloxetine was the probable cause for the symptoms described.
Overdose with duloxetine can induce coma several hours after intake, with a fast reversal in our case.
Imipramine hydrochloride shows effects in a battery of tests used for the screening of antidepressant drugs. The central origin of these pharmacological effects of imipramine has not been clearly established. Imipramine methiodide is a quaternary derivative of imipramine which does not cross the blood-brain barrier easily. The effects of the two forms of imipramine have been compared: on an effect known to have a central origin; on two effects known to have a peripheral origin; on a battery of tests used for the screening of antidepressant drugs. It has been demonstrated that imipramine methiodide is as active as imipramine hydrochloride on two effects of peripheral origin, less active than imipramine hydrochloride on an effect considered to have a central origin and less active than imipramine hydrochloride or inactive on the tests which are used for the screening of antidepressant drugs. Consequently, the tests used for the screening of antidepressant drugs represent, primarily or exclusively, effects of central origin.
To report and describe a case of refractory hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) associated with metastatic, transitional-cell carcinoma of the left ureter.
A 71-year-old male complaining of generalized weakness and night sweats for the past 3 months was sent to the emergency department when routine laboratory tests revealed a corrected serum calcium concentration of 14.4 mg/dL. Intravenous crystalloid fluids and pamidronate were administered with achievement of normocalcemia, and the patient was discharged. Computed tomography scan and liver biopsy revealed recurrent transitional-cell carcinoma with extensive liver metastasis. The patient returned approximately 1 week after discharge with a serum calcium level of 13.9 mg/dL. An initial decrease in serum calcium was observed with intravenous fluids, pamidronate, and calcitonin, but the normalization slowed and reversed within 3 days. Normocalcemia was achieved upon administration of zoledronic acid and the patient was discharged on day 14. The patient died 1 week after discharge from complications unrelated to hypercalcemia.
Hypercalcemia is common in patients with malignancy and is associated with potentially life-threatening sequelae. Four mechanisms of HCM have been recognized thus far, with ectopic tumor production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) being the leading cause. Treatment of HCM revolves around 2 principles: treatment of the underlying malignancy along with reduction of the serum calcium level. Evidence-based therapies for management include: intravenous crystalloid fluids with or without loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, gallium nitrate, and corticosteroids. Therapies used for this patient included aggressive hydration, calcitonin, and 3 distinct treatment courses of intravenous bisphosphonates with varying success. Other potential agents were explored for use in the event of continued hypercalcemia. These therapies remain viable options based on individual patient factors. To our knowledge, no published guidelines or algorithms exist for choosing between additional modalities in the treatment of refractory HCM.
For patients with HCM who do not achieve a response from bisphosphonates, or for those who need repeated dosing more often than expected, changing to a different drug class could be an alternative. The specific mechanism of hypercalcemia should be considered when developing a treatment regimen for patients who have had a suboptimal response to initial therapy with bisphosphonates. Multiple treatment modalities exist for the treatment of hypercalcemia, each with a different mechanism of action. As with the treatment of other disease states, we can use this knowledge to more specifically target the mechanism of the patient's disease.
Hepatotoxicity, including cholestasis, is a rare but significant complication of treatment with calcineurin inhibitors. Timely life-saving therapy with revision of immunosuppression is mandatory. A 43-year-old woman with pulmonary hypertension was found to have severe cholestasis (serum bilirubin up to 35 mg/dL) after a living-donor lobar lung transplantation. Calcineurin-inhibitor cholestasis markedly improved after withdrawal of the calcineurin inhibitor, initiation of sirolimus, and interleukin-2 receptor blockade. Awareness of the diagnostic criteria of this rare posttransplant complication is important to initiate timely therapy.
Chronic administration of lithium salts is associated with hypercalciuria in the rat. To study the renal and extrarenal mechanisms of this phenomenon, we utilized balance and clearance techniques in rats pair-fed diets with or without Li2CO3 (0.5 meq/day per rat). Lithium induced hypercalcemia (mean +/- SE: 5.40 +/- 0.09 VS. 5.06 +/- 0.05 meq/liter) and hypercalciuria (Ca/creatinine = 0.28 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.03) only during feeding. When CaCO2 supplement to a calcium-deficient diet was abruptly withdrawn, hypercalciuria was abolished. However, polyuria and polydipsia persisted. No significant changes in serum phosphate, urine phosphate, sodium, pH, or citrate were observed. Chronic parathyroidectomy (PTX) also abolished this effect. During clearance studies, fasting excretion of calcium was similar between treated and control animals. Superimposed acute PTX resulted in comparable changes, hence arguing against primary changes in renal calcium reabsorption or changes in parathyroid hormone effects on the renal tubule. Thus, lithium produces absorptive hypercalciuria by a mechanism dependent on intact parathyroid glands and adequate diet calcium, but independent of urine sodium, phosphate, or pH. The active component of gut calcium transport may be involved, possibly via alterations of vitamin D metabolism.
Acrolein (Acr) is a major toxicant in cigarette smoke (CS); it can interact with DNA forming two major adduct isomers: alpha-OH-Acr-dG and gamma-OH-Acr-dG. Previously, we found that the Acr-DNA binding pattern in the human p53 gene coincides with the p53 mutational pattern in CS-related lung cancer; hence, we proposed that Acr is a major lung cancer etiological agent [ Feng , Z. , Hu , W. , Hu , Y. , and Tang , M.-s. ( 2006 ) Acrolein is a major cigarette-related lung cancer agent: Preferential binding at p53 mutational hotspots and inhibition of DNA repair . Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103 , 15404 - 15409 ]. This hypothesis has been brought into question with recent work that failed to detect Acr-induced mutations in the pSP189 system [ Kim , S. I. , Pfeifer , G. P. , and Besaratinia , A. ( 2007 ) Lack of mutagenicity of acrolein-induced DNA adducts in mouse and human cells . Cancer Res. 67 , 11640 - 116472 ]. To resolve this controversy, we determined the level and the type of Acr-dG formation, and the mutagenicity of Acr-dG adducts in the same pSP189 system. We also mapped the Acr-dG adduct distribution at the nucleotide level and the Acr-dG-induced mutational spectrum in this system. We found that (1) gamma-OH-Acr-dG is the major adduct formed in Acr-modified DNA based on the LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis; (2) the mutation frequency is proportional to the extent of Acr modifications, the majority of which are G:C to T:A and G:C to A:T mutations; and (3) sequences with a run of Gs are the mutational hotspots. Using the UvrABC nuclease incision method to map the Acr-dG distribution in the supF gene sequence, we confirmed that Acr-DNA adducts preferentially form in guanine-rich sequences that are also mutational hotspots. These results reaffirm that Acr-dG adducts are mutagenic and support our hypothesis that Acr is a major etiological agent for CS and cooking fume-related lung cancer.
Unilateral injection of morphine (1.0, 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms/0.5 microliter) into the substantia nigra pars reticulata produced, in a dose-dependent way, tonic activity in the electromyogram (EMG) recorded from the ipsilateral gastrocnemius-soleus muscle of unanaesthetized rats. The effect produced by 5 micrograms of morphine was antagonized by co-administration of 5 micrograms of naloxone. Bilateral injection of morphine (5 micrograms each side) also produced a tonic activity in the EMG and catalepsy, but no asymmetry of posture. Unilateral injection of morphine (5 micrograms) into the substantia nigra pars compacta produced contralateral turning and/or stereotypy, but no tonic activity in the EMG. Naloxone (5 micrograms), when injected into the substantia nigra failed to produce any tonic activity in the EMG or any catalepsy. Larger doses of naloxone (10 or 20 micrograms) produced slight to moderate tonic activity in the EMG when injected into the pars reticulata. Injections of saline (0.5 microliter) into either the reticulata or compacta were ineffective. Bilateral lesions of the caudate nucleus with kainic acid (1 microgram each side) did not prevent the development either of the tonic activity in the EMG or of the catalepsy, which were both produced by unilateral injection of morphine (5 micrograms) into the pars reticulata. These results suggest that opioid mechanisms in the nigra might play a role in the regulation of posture and muscle tone and participate in the expression of motor functions controlled by the striatum (and probably also by the nucleus accumbens).
Many benzo[b]furan lignans are known to be biologically active in nature. 2-(3'-Methoxy-4'-hydroxy-phenyl)-5-(3-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-benzo[b]furan-3-carbaldehyde (XH-14) is found as a bioactive component isolated from the plant Salvia miltiorrhiza, commonly known as Danshen, which is a traditional Chinese medicine that is used as a cardiovascular medication. This study examined whether 3 different XH-14 derivatives can inhibit adipocyte differentiation and induction of the adipokines visfatin and resistin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Adipocytes were cultured and differentiated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing fetal bovine serum, 3-isobytyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin for 6-8d in the absence and presence of 1-25μM XH-14-derived benzo[b]furan derivatives. Nontoxic 2-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxy-phenyl)-6-(3-hydroxypropyl)-5-methoxy-benzo[b]furan (5-MBF) at ≥5μM attenuated cellular lipid accumulation and down-regulated induction of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) in a dose-dependent manner, as evidenced by Oil Red O staining and Western blot analysis. Such inhibition of PPAR( and C/EBP( by 5-MBF was achieved at transcriptional mRNA levels. However, 2-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxy-phenyl)-5-(3-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-benzo[b]furan (7-MBF) and 2-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxy-phenyl)-5-(3-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-benzo[b]furan (6-MBF) had minimal effects on adipogenic differentiation, suggesting a structure-activity relationship of methoxybenzo[b]furan derivatives as an inhibitor of adipogenic differentiation. Furthermore, ≥5μM 5-MBF retarded protein and mRNA expression of proinflammatory and insulin resistance-enhancing adipokines of visfatin and resistin in differentiated adipocytes. Induction of visfatin and resistin was, at least in part, mediated via adipocyte differentiation-associated activation of PPARγ signal targeting adipocyte protein 2 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase. These results demonstrate that the 2-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxy-phenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl benzo[b]furan lignan, with a methoxy group at the 5-position on the benzene ring, may be a promising agent for disturbance of adipogenic differentiation and for blockage of obesity-associated inflammatory and metabolic diseases.
The molecular and cellular control of embryonic testis development was investigated through an analysis of the embryonic testis transcriptome to identify potential regulatory factors for male sex determination and testis morphogenesis. One critical factor identified is neurotropin 3 (NT3). At the onset of male sex determination, Sertoli cells initiate differentiation and express NT3 to act as a chemotactic factor for mesonephros cells to migrate and associate with Sertoli-germ cell aggregates to promote cord formation. Promoter analysis suggests that NT3 may be an initial downstream gene to SRY and helps promote testis morphogenesis. Endocrine disruptors were used to potentially interfere with embryonic testis development and further investigate this biological process. The estrogenic pesticide methoxychlor and antiandrogenic fungicide vinclozolin were used. Previous studies have shown that methoxychlor and vinclozolin both interfere with embryonic testis cord formation and cause increased spermatogenic cell apoptosis in the adult testis. Interestingly, transient in vivo exposure to endocrine disruptors at the time of male sex determination caused a transgenerational phenotype (F1-F4) of spermatogenic cell apoptosis and subfertility. This apparent epigenetic mechanism involves altered DNA methylation and permanent re-programming of the male germ-line. A series of genes with altered DNA methylation and imprinting are being identified. Observations reviewed demonstrate that a transient embryonic in utero exposure to an endocrine disruptor influences the embryonic testis transcriptome and through epigenetic effects (e.g., DNA methylation) results in abnormal germ-cell differentiation that subsequently influences adult spermatogenic capacity and male fertility, and that this phenotype is transgenerational through the germ-line. The novel observations of transgenerational epigenetic endocrine disruptor actions on male reproduction critically impact the potential hazards of these compounds as environmental toxins. The literature reviewed provides insight into the molecular and cellular control of embryonic testis development, male sex determination, and the programming of the male germ-line.
Treatment with the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine appears to be associated with an increased incidence of urinary incontinence (UI). We posited that the potent anti-alpha-adrenergic effects of clozapine were involved, and hence that an alpha-adrenergic agonist would reduce UI. We tested this hypothesis by using ephedrine, an approved alpha-adrenergic agonist.
Fifty-seven inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who met the Kane criteria for being treatment refractory were treated with clozapine (75-900 mg/day). Patients who developed UI were then openly treated with ephedrine in increasing doses until UI was attenuated or a dose of 150 mg/day was attained.
Seventeen patients developed UI as evidenced by either urine-stained sheets/clothing or direct patient reports. In 2 cases, the UI was sufficiently severe that adult diapers had to be used. Comparison of patients who developed UI and those who did not showed that UI was associated with female gender and with concomitant treatment with typical antipsychotic drugs. One patient was treated with a behavioral program, but the remaining 16 patients were treated with ephedrine. Ephedrine treatment was very effective, with 15/16 patients showing improvement within 24 hours after reaching maximum ephedrine dosage. Twelve of 16 (including the 2 most severe) eventually had a complete remission of their UI. In the remaining 4 patients, 3 had a reduction in the frequency of UI and 1 showed no response. These benefits have been maintained over the course of 12 months of subsequent treatment for several patients. There were no side effects associated with the use of ephedrine nor were there any changes in neuropsychiatric status.
Ephedrine appears to be a safe and effective treatment clozapine-associated UI. By inference, it is likely that clozapine may cause UI via its anti-alpha-adrenergic properties.
Thirty-seven separate episodes of acute bronchial asthma were studied in 21 asthmatic children. The bronchodilator, cardiovascular, and tremorigenic responses following administration of salbutamol (SAL), terbutaline (TER) and fenoterol (FEN) by closed-port intermittent nebulization were compared for a period of 8 hr. SAL was used at the maximum dose recommended by the manufacturer and TER and FEN at the average doses commonly used in children. Eleven acute attacks were treated with SAL, 12 with TER, and 14 with FEN. Pulmonary function was evaluated by clinical assessment and by the spirometric indices FEV1 and FEF25-75. Tremor was objectively measured, as well as heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, and blood pressure. The onset of bronchodilating effect occurred at 5 min for all three drugs and there were no differences in intensity and duration of bronchodilation between drugs. All three drugs caused rapid onset of tremor (5 min) and this tended to be more intense with SAL. There was a slight decrease in HR in the TER group, whereas SAL and FEN caused increase in HR, with mean values significantly greater than in the TER group from 5 to 30 min after drug administration. Our results indicate that the three short-acting beta 2-agonists studied are equally effective in treatment of acute bronchospasm by the inhaled route in children, in the doses used. Our findings imply that a dose of SAL twice as great as that commonly used by nebulization in children is equipotent to those usually employed for TER and FEN, as far as therapeutic effect is concerned, but it could generate more intense tremorigenic and tachycardic side effects.
Some drugs including streptokinase have been reported to precipitate Guillain-Barré syndrome. We report a 70-year-old man with acute anterior myocardial infarction who developed Guillain-Barré syndrome seven days after thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible antinociceptive effect of Heterotheca inuloides in inflammatory pain and to identify the main compounds involved in this effect. Dose-response curves were obtained for hexane, dichlorometane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from Heterotheca inuloides inflorescences in the formalin test. Hexane extract was more potent and effective than other extracts. Bio-guided fractionation was performed to determine the main antinociceptive compounds of the plant. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique demonstrated the composition of the most active fraction from hexane extract revealing the presence of caryophyllene oxide, cedrene, 7-hydroxy-3,4-dihydrocadalin, 7-hydroxycadalene and a compound not identified. The isolated compounds were individually evaluated in the formalin test in a preliminary dose of 100 μg/paw and only 7-hydroxy-3,4-dihydrocadalin showed a significant antinociceptive effect. Dose-response curves were then obtained for 7-hydroxy-3,4-dihydrocadalin and diclofenac, a prototypical analgesic drug. Both drugs were equieffective and equipotent in the second phase of the formalin test, but 7-hydroxy-3,4-dihydrocadalin was more effective and potent in the first phase than diclofenac. In addition, 7-hydroxy-3,4-dihydrocadalin reduced carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia and inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, in mechanistic studies, the antinociceptive effect of 7-hydroxy-3,4-dihydrocadalin in the formalin test was prevented by methiothepin, WAY100635, SB224289 and BRL15572 but not by naltrexone. Results support the use of H. inuloides inflorescences as analgesic in the Mexican traditional medicine. Moreover, data indicate that 7-hydroxy-3,4-dihydrocadalin is partly responsible of this pharmacological activity, and suggest that 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(1D) serotonergic, but not opioid, receptors participate in the antinociceptive effect of this drug.
Hyperprolactinemia, an adverse effect associated with the use of typical antipsychotics and the atypical antipsychotic risperidone, has both acute and chronic clinical consequences. One option for clinical management is switching to an agent with a lower liability for inducing hyperprolactinemia. This post-hoc sub-analysis of an 8-week, open-label study in outpatients with schizophrenia (CN138-215) examined short-term effects on prolactin levels during a switch from risperidone or olanzapine to aripiprazole 30 mg/day. Three switch strategies were used: (I) immediate aripiprazole initiation with simultaneous immediate discontinuation of olanzapine/risperidone; (II) immediate aripiprazole initiation while tapering off olanzapine/risperidone over 14 days; (III) titrating aripiprazole upwards while tapering off olanzapine/risperidone over 14 days. Changes in prolactin levels from baseline to each last observation carried forward time point were compared with t-tests using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This sub-analysis included 269 subjects: 105 previously treated with risperidone; 164 previously treated with olanzapine. Mean baseline prolactin levels (ng/mL) were within normal range for the three olanzapine groups (Group-I, 11.7; Group-II, 13.2; Group-III, 11.2), but above normal for the risperidone groups (Group-I, 39.7; Group-II, 48.5; Group-III, 33.5). Following aripiprazole initiation, mean prolactin levels decreased significantly (p<0.001) at week-1 and were maintained to week-8 in all groups irrespective of prior treatment. Previously elevated prolactin levels in the risperidone groups were reduced to within normal range within 1 week, irrespective of switching strategy. Tolerability was good regardless of prior medication or switching strategy. Overall, rapid decreases of prolactin levels were achieved safely with all three aripiprazole switching strategies. Reversal of hyperprolactinemia during the crossover period indicates the safety and potential utility of aripiprazole addition in patients with elevated prolactin.
Nedd4-2 has been proposed to play a critical role in regulating epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) activity. Biochemical and overexpression experiments suggest that Nedd4-2 binds to the PY motifs of ENaC subunits via its WW domains, ubiquitinates them, and decreases their expression on the apical membrane. Phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 (for example by Sgk1) may regulate its binding to ENaC, and thus ENaC ubiquitination. These results suggest that the interaction between Nedd4-2 and ENaC may play a crucial role in Na+ homeostasis and blood pressure (BP) regulation. To test these predictions in vivo, we generated Nedd4-2 null mice. The knockout mice had higher BP on a normal diet and a further increase in BP when on a high-salt diet. The hypertension was probably mediated by ENaC overactivity because 1) Nedd4-2 null mice had higher expression levels of all three ENaC subunits in kidney, but not of other Na+ transporters; 2) the downregulation of ENaC function in colon was impaired; and 3) NaCl-sensitive hypertension was substantially reduced in the presence of amiloride, a specific inhibitor of ENaC. Nedd4-2 null mice on a chronic high-salt diet showed cardiac hypertrophy and markedly depressed cardiac function. Overall, our results demonstrate that in vivo Nedd4-2 is a critical regulator of ENaC activity and BP. The absence of this gene is sufficient to produce salt-sensitive hypertension. This model provides an opportunity to further investigate mechanisms and consequences of this common disorder.
We report a case of a reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). A 57-year-old male had classical polyarteritis nodosa with mononeuritis multiplex, renal insufficiency, and a high titer of p-ANCA (MPO). He was normotensive. He was treated with high dose methylprednisolone and then with oral prednisolone and cyclophosphamide. Despite the treatment, his renal function rapidly deteriorated and hypertension progressed. He had two generalized seizures; at that time his blood pressure was 200/140 mmHg. CT scan revealed bilaterally symmetric hypodensities in the thalamus, the occipital white matter, and the brainstem. T2-weighted MRI showed increased signal intensities in the temporo-occipital white matter, the thalamus, the posterior limbs of the internal capsules, the external capsules, the midbrain, the pons, and the middle cerebellar peduncles. T1-weighted images showed hypointensities in these areas. Treatment with nifedipine improved his blood pressure; 5 days later he was only moderately disoriented. Follow-up CT demonstrated an ill-defined hypodense area only in the left parietal lobe. To our knowledge, there are only two reported cases of RPLS associated with systemic vasculitides. Interestingly, thalamic lesions are outstanding also in these cases. Under these circumstances, treatment of hypertension is of primary importance, and steroid therapy should not be withdrawn or reduced.
Methods for the evaluation in experimental animals of toxic substances that produce hearing impairment are described. In the experiments reported here, animals were trained by positive reinforcement operant conditioning procedures so that their hearing could be examined by behavioral means. When normal hearing was established, aminoglycosidic antibiotics (kanamycin and dihydrostreptomycin) were given daily and hearing tests administered in order that the course of hearing loss could be closely followed. Initial loss of sensitivity to the high frequencies always progressed in time to impairment at the low frequencies, and these changes in hearing were correlated with a loss of receptor cells in the inner ear which started in the basal region of the cochlea and advanced toward the apex. Although such behavioral procedures are moderately expensive to instrument and relatively time-consuming to apply, they are shown to yield valid quantitative measures of hearing. Further, they provide for reliable early detection of the toxic process and a measure of behavioral impairment that can be precisely related to the histopathological changes that occur simultaneously in the inner ear and auditory nerve.
A patient developed cholestatic hepatitis while being treated with nitrofurantoin. A second episode of jaundice followed the intravaginal administration of a mixture of furazolidone and nifuroxime. It is important to consider possible cross-sensitivity of chemically related compounds even when they are administered by different routes.
To determine whether prilocaine is a more comfortable local infiltration anaesthetic agent than the more widely used lignocaine for minor eyelid procedures.
A prospective randomised study was undertaken to compare the discomfort between local infiltration of plain 2% prilocaine versus its equivalent, plain 2% lignocaine. One hundred and twenty-five patients were recruited. Pain was assessed subjectively using a visual analogue pain score, graded from 0 to 10.
The mean pain score for the prilocaine group was 1.82 compared with 3.19 for the lignocaine group. Using the Mann-Whitney U-test for significance, U = 1236.5; p < 0.001.
Prilocaine is a more comfortable local infiltration anaesthetic agent than lignocaine when used for minor eyelid procedures.
Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D: -aspartic acid antagonist, has been widely used for anaesthetic purposes. At sub-anaesthetic dosage, it induces a dissociative state similar to schizophrenia. The discovery of this effect on dissociative state has led to its use as a pharmacological model of schizophrenia and has also been responsible for its illegal use as a recreational drug. Whereas the former has provided invaluable information, the latter has demonstrated that repeated administration of ketamine induces tolerance. Surprisingly, a review of the relevant literature shows that tolerance to sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine is largely unreported in neuropharmacological studies.
In order to investigate this caveat, we have performed a post hoc analysis of the behavioural effects induced by repeated injections of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine observed in five consecutive monkeys performing two oculomotor tasks. Ketamine effects were quantified by the animals' performances and latencies in a prosaccade and an antisaccade task, two oculomotor paradigms that are impaired after ketamine administration.
Although the result of the initial injections confirmed a clear behavioural effect of ketamine injections in all monkeys, subsequent administrations showed that a tolerance eventually appeared in all monkeys. The profile of this tolerance exhibited however a large inter-subject variability.
Psychopharmacological experiments using ketamine as a pharmacological model of psychosis should therefore consider the kinetic and time course of these effects in each individuals and take them into account in the design of experimental protocols.
