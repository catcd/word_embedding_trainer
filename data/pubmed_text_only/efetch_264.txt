Arsenic is a known human carcinogen, but development of rodent models of inorganic arsenic carcinogenesis has been problematic. Since gestation is often a period of high sensitivity to chemical carcinogenesis, we performed a transplacental carcinogenicity study in mice using inorganic arsenic. Groups (n = 10) of pregnant C3H mice were given drinking water containing sodium arsenite (NaAsO(2)) at 0 (control), 42.5, and 85 ppm arsenite ad libitum from day 8 to 18 of gestation. These doses were well tolerated and body weights of the dams during gestation and of the offspring subsequent to birth were not reduced. Dams were allowed to give birth, and offspring were weaned at 4 weeks and then put into separate gender-based groups (n = 25) according to maternal exposure level. The offspring received no additional arsenic treatment. The study lasted 74 weeks in males and 90 weeks in females. A complete necropsy was performed on all mice and tissues were examined by light microscopy in a blind fashion. In male offspring, there was a marked increase in hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in a dose- related fashion (control, 12%; 42.5 ppm, 38%; 85 ppm, 61%) and in liver tumor multiplicity (tumors per liver; 5.6-fold over control at 85 ppm). In males, there was also a dose-related increase in adrenal tumor incidence and multiplicity. In female offspring, dose-related increases occurred in ovarian tumor incidence (control, 8%; 42.5 ppm, 26%; 85 ppm, 38%) and lung carcinoma incidence (control, 0%; 42.5 ppm, 4%; 85 ppm, 21%). Arsenic exposure also increased the incidence of proliferative lesions of the uterus and oviduct. These results demonstrate that oral inorganic arsenic exposure, as a single agent, can induce tumor formation in rodents and establishes inorganic arsenic as a complete transplacental carcinogen in mice. The development of this rodent model of inorganic arsenic carcinogenesis has important implications in defining the mechanism of action for this common environmental carcinogen.
Lovastatin, a drug commonly used in the clinic to treat hypercholesterolemia, has previously been reported to exert antitumor effects in rodent tumor models and to strengthen the antitumor effects of immune response modifiers (tumor necrosis factor alpha and IFN-gamma) or chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin). In the present report, we show in three murine tumor cell lines (Colon-26 cells, v-Ha-ras-transformed NIH-3T3 sarcoma cells, and Lewis lung carcinoma cells) that lovastatin can also effectively potentiate the cytostatic/cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin. In three tumor models (Co-ion-26 cells, v-Ha-ras-transformed NIH-3T3 sarcoma cells, and Lewis lung carcinoma cells) in vivo, we have demonstrated significantly increased sensitivity to the combined treatment with both lovastatin (15 mg/kg for 10 days) and doxorubicin (3 x 2.5 mg/kg; cumulative dose, 7.5 mg/kg) as compared with either agent acting alone. Lovastatin treatment also resulted in a significant reduction of troponin T release by cardiomyocytes in doxorubicin-treated mice. This observation is particularly interesting because lovastatin is known to reduce doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury.
Our aim was to investigate whether neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 (NOR-1), an early gene induced by low density lipoproteins (LDL) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), is regulated by statins.
NOR-1 expression was analyzed in human VSMC in culture and in vivo in the aorta of diet-induced hyperlipemic pigs by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was used as an index of DNA synthesis. NOR-1 promoter activity was analyzed using a luciferase reporter system. Cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding was assessed by EMSA and ELISA and CREB activation (phosphorylation in Ser133) by Western blotting.
Simvastatin inhibited NOR-1 expression induced by LDL in VSMC and by hypercholesterolemia in the abdominal aorta of hyperlipemic pigs. The inhibition of the isoprenylation of geranylgeranylated proteins by simvastatin was key in both NOR-1 up-regulation and DNA synthesis induced by LDL. Inhibitors of RhoA (toxin B and exotoxin C3) and ROCK (Y-27632) mimicked the effect of simvastatin on NOR-1. Similarly both simvastatin treatment and cells transfected with a RhoA dominant-negative (RhoAT19N) showed inhibition of LDL-induced NOR-1 promoter activity. These effects were associated to the interference of the activation of CREB, a key transcription factor involved in NOR-1 induction. Finally, simvastatin prevented LDL induction of a reporter construct containing four consensus CRE and inhibited the expression of SMemb (a marker for dedifferentiated VSMC) dependent on CREB.
NOR-1 is a target for simvastatin in the vascular wall. We identified NOR-1 and CREB as key transcription factors mediating the effect of statins on VSMC proliferation through a mechanism dependent on RhoA/ROCK.
Prostaglandin E(1) analogues, gemeprost and misoprostol, are the most widely used drugs for medical termination of pregnancy within the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Gemeprost has been reported to be associated with acute cardiovascular accidents in a few cases, but no adverse cardiovascular events have been reported with misoprostol. For this reason, misoprostol has been considered a potentially safer drug and is widely recommended as a first-choice drug in combination with mifepristone. We report a case of a 32-year-old woman with active smoking and obesity, who developed an episode of transient acute coronary artery vasospasm following the administration of intravaginal misoprostol. This report illustrates that misoprostol can also be associated with acute coronary events, although it remains to be evaluated whether the risk is similar or lower to gemeprost.
Direct current cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation is one of the most widely used and effective treatments for the restoration of sinus rhythm, but may be hampered by a low success rate and a high percentage of early recurrence. Pre-treatment with amiodarone or a glucose-insulin-potassium solution could improve the efficacy of electrical cardioversion by reversing the partially depolarized diastolic potential of the subsidiary pacemakers in atrial fibrillation. In a controlled randomized study, we assessed the effectiveness of electrical cardioversion in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation after pre-treatment with amiodarone or potassium infusion and the efficacy of amiodarone in maintaining sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion.
Ninety-two patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (>2 weeks duration) were prospectively randomized into three matched groups: A (n=31, oral amiodarone 400 mg. day(-1)1 month before and 200 mg. day(-1)2 months after cardioversion), B (n=31, 180 mg. day(-1)oral diltiazem 1 month before and 2 months after cardioversion and 80 mmol potassium, 50 UI insulin in 500 ml 30% glucose solution 24 h before cardioversion) and C (n=30, control patients, 180 mg. day(-1)oral diltiazem 1 month before and 2 months after cardioversion). Before cardioversion all patients were under 4 weeks effective oral anticoagulant therapy (warfarin). Before electrical cardioversion, the rate of spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm was higher in group A (25%) than groups B (6%) or C (3%) (P<0.005). Electrical cardioversion was more successful in group A (88%) than groups B (56%) or C (65%) (P<0.05), while the electrical thresholds for effective cardioversion were lower in group B than the other groups (P<0.05). Twenty-four hours after cardioversion, the early recurrence of atrial fibrillation was similar in the three groups (P=ns), while at 2 months the recurrence rate was lower in group A (32%) than groups B (56%) or C (52%) (P<0.01).
Pre-treatment with low-dose oral amiodarone, compared with oral diltiazem or glucose-insulin-potassium treatments, induces a significantly high percentage of instances of spontaneous conversion, increases electrical cardioversion efficacy and reduces atrial fibrillation recurrence.
This study was designed to examine the effect of dexamethasone treatment on tissue and urinary prostanoids, and to determine whether inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis by manipulation of dietary fatty acids accelerates the development of glucocorticoid hypertension. Forty-eight rats were placed on either a 2-series prostaglandin 'inhibitory' diet (cod liver oil/linseed oil) or a control diet of saturated fat for an initial period of 4 weeks. The groups were then divided into two so that half of each received dexamethasone in their drinking water (2.5 mg/l) for 1 week whilst continuing their respective dietary regimens. Rats on the cod liver oil diet incorporated eicosapentaenoic acid into tissue stores with a corresponding decrease in arachidonic acid, and significantly impaired ability to generate serum thromboxane B2 (33%), aortic 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha (44%), renal homogenate prostaglandin E2 (45%) and 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha (74%) and urinary prostaglandin E2 (84%) and 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha (79%). Despite the diminished levels of vasodilator 2-series prostaglandins, the cod liver oil diet prevented the development of glucocorticoid induced hypertension. Relative to their respective dietary controls, dexamethasone treatment resulted in decreased serum thromboxane B2 (20%) but increased aortic 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha (186%), renal homogenate prostaglandins (127-230%) and urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 (640-860%) and 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha (230-365%) in both dietary groups. It therefore seems unlikely that glucocorticoid induced hypertension is a consequence of inhibition of vasodilator prostaglandin synthesis.
The authors report a case of acute myocardial infarction following gemcitabine infusion and electrocardiographic abnormalities suggestive of ischemia on rechallenge of the drug. The possible underlying mechanisms of ischemia and/or infarction and the strategies for prevention are discussed.
Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-specific protein with insulin-sensitizing and antiatherogenic properties. Therefore, the adiponectin gene is a promising candidate gene for type 2 diabetes. We investigated the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) +45T/G and +276G/T of the adiponectin gene as predictors for the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes in the STOP-NIDDM trial, which aimed to investigate the effect of acarbose compared with placebo on the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Compared with the TT genotype, the G-allele of SNP +45 was associated with a 1.8-fold risk for type 2 diabetes (95% CI 1.12-3.00, P = 0.015) in the placebo group. Subjects treated with placebo and simultaneously having the G-allele of SNP +45 and the T-allele of SNP +276 (the risk genotype combination) had a 4.5-fold (1.78-11.3, P = 0.001) higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with subjects carrying neither of these alleles. Women carrying the risk genotype combination had an especially high risk of conversion to diabetes (odds ratio 22.2, 95% CI 2.7-183.3, P = 0.004). In conclusion, the G-allele of SNP +45 is a predictor for the conversion to type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the combined effect of SNP +45 and SNP +276 on the development of type 2 diabetes was stronger than that of each SNP alone.
Twenty-two patients developed significant thrombocytopenia (5,000 to 96,000/cu mm; mean, 29,000/cu mm) while receiving prophylactic or therapeutic heparin. Seventeen of them developed serious thrombohemorrhagic complications which accelerated the deaths of six and contributed to the late death of one. Cessation of heparin therapy led to an immediate remission of the thrombohemorrhagic complications and thrombocytopenia, with no patient who was not already moribund dying, once appropriate therapy had been instituted. Platelet-count monitoring is recommended for all patients receiving heparin for more than 6 days, with cessation of heparin therapy mandatory for the successful management of patients with this disorder. Evidence is presented for an immunologic etiology for this disorder.
This is a case report of possible association of methylphenidate and enuresis in an 11-year-old boy with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
To improve on drug dosage decisions, the method of "marginal analysis," traditionally found in the economics literature, is applied to the dose-response curve. Marginal analysis is first defined and explained, next the technique is redefined for the clinical setting of dose determination subject to drug efficacy and side effects, and finally an example using adjuvant adriamycin chemotherapy in osteosarcoma is presented. By not using "marginal analysis," clinicians may not be maximizing overall therapeutic success or patient survival. Implications for future clinical trials are discussed, and a suggestion for estimating dose-response is proposed. The technique described should be readily applicable to many dosing problems, and need not be restricted to chemotherapy dosing decisions.
The toxicity of size-fractionated particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) collected in Milano during two different seasons (summer and winter) has been evaluated in vivo. The focus is on time related (3 h, 24 h and 1 week) lung response following a single intratracheal aerosolization in BALB/c mice. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) and the lung parenchyma were screened for different markers of inflammation and cytotoxicity. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed on excised fixed lungs to assess the effects produced by the different PM fractions. All the analyzed inflammatory markers (PMNs percentage, TNF-α, Hsp70 in the BALf, HO-1 in lung parenchyma), increased after summer PM10 administration; on the contrary winter PM10 and PM2.5 specifically increased the amount of the Cyp1B1, a protein putatively involved in the induction of pro-carcinogenic effect. Moreover, we detected an intensification of LDH activity in the BALf after the administration of winter PM10 and PM2.5, potentially related to an in progress necrotic process while after summer PM10 and PM2.5 administration, the initiation of the caspase cascade suggested a cytotoxic effect sustained by apoptosis. Our results evidenced the toxicity mechanisms elicited by size fractionated PM samples, collected in winter and summer seasons, which differs for dimensions, chemical and microbiological composition. PM10 has been indicated to elicit above all a pro-inflammatory response, linked to its specific biological components, while PM2.5 is supposed to be more harmful due to its smaller dimension and the ability to distribute into the lung alveolar districts. We hypothesized that adverse health effects observed after a single dose of winter PM2.5 is at least partly caused by specific winter PM components, i.e. PAH and transitional metals.
Whether elderly people suffer from age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics with administration of benzodiazepines is still a matter of controversy. We investigated the course of brain function and thermoregulation after oral administration of a standard benzodiazepine, diazepam (DZP), in 8 healthy young men (mean age, 19.8 years; range, 18 to 23 years) and 8 healthy middle-aged and older men (mean age, 60.9 years; range, 53 to 71 years). Placebo or DZP was administered in a single-blind crossover manner to the young men (placebo, 5-mg, 10-mg DZP) and to the older men (placebo, 5-mg DZP), and plasma DZP concentration, choice reaction time, proximal body temperature, and distal body temperature were monitored with high time resolution under a modified constant routine condition to exclude masking effects. Whereas there was no evidence of age-related alterations in pharmacokinetics between the 2 groups, the older subjects, in comparison to the young subjects, showed a more delayed choice reaction time in response to the same plasma DZP level, suggesting that hypersensitivity is related to increased age. DZP at 5 mg in the older subjects induced acute and transient hypothermia to the same degree as that induced by DZP at 10 mg in the young subjects. The distal-proximal body temperature gradient (difference between distal body temperature and proximal body temperature), an indicator of blood flow in distal skin regions, showed strong positive correlation with the delay in choice reaction time in both groups. These findings suggest that hypersensitivity to benzodiazepine in older persons may be due, at least in part, to age-related changes in thermoregulation, especially in the heat loss process.
The hydatic cyst is a pathology observed in developing countries. Multiple cerebral localizations with a cardiac origin are exceptional and are sometimes diagnosed only after onset of complications. We present the case of a 22-year-old male student: the diagnosis of multiple cerebral hydatic cysts caused by rupture of a cardiac hydatic cyst was established after an episode of ischemia of the limbs with cerebral hemorrhage induced by heparin. One year later, the clinical situation consisted in intracranial hypertension, hemiplegia and convulsive seizures. We observed no cardiac symptoms. The brain CT showed 9 hydatic cysts and echocardiography showed a myxomatous cystic tumor. Abdominal CT detected renal and splenic hydatic cysts. The patient underwent total ablation of the cerebral and abdominal cysts and made a full recovery. After surgical removal of the cardiac cyst, the patient has been lost to follow-up. Cerebral hydatidosis of cardiac origin is highly exceptional and, due to nonspecific symptomatology, may go undiagnosed. In general, prognosis is good in case of a cerebral localization but the cardiac localization is associated with high mortality.
Hearts from severely Cu-deficient rats show a variety of pathological defects, including hypertrophy and, in intact hearts, depression of contractile function. Paradoxically, isolated cardiomyocytes from these rats exhibit enhanced contractile properties. Because hypertrophy and enhanced contractility observed with other pathologies are associated with elevation of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF)-I, this mechanism was examined for the case of dietary Cu deficiency. Male, weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were provided diets that were deficient (approximately 0.5 mg Cu/kg diet) or adequate (approximately 6 mg Cu/kg diet) in Cu for 5 wk. IGF-I was measured in serum and hearts by an ELISA method, cardiac IGF-I and IGF-II receptors and IGFBP-3 were measured by Western blotting analysis, and mRNAs for cardiac IGF-I and IGF-II were measured by RT-PCR. Contractility of isolated cardiomyocytes was assessed by a video-based edge-detection system. Cu deficiency depressed serum and heart IGF-I and heart IGFBP-3 protein levels and increased cardiac IGF-I receptor protein. Cardiac IGF-II protein and mRNA for cardiac IGF-I and IGF-II were unaffected by Cu deficiency. A Cu deficiency-induced increase in cardiomyocyte contractility, as indicated by increases in maximal velocities of shortening (-dL/dt) and relengthening (+dL/dt) and decrease in time to peak shortening (TPS), was confirmed. These changes were largely inhibited by use of H-1356, an IGF-I receptor blocker. We conclude that enhanced sensitivity to IGF-I, as indicated by an increase in IGF-I receptor protein, accounts for the increased contractility of Cu-deficient cardiomyocytes and may presage cardiac failure.
Ramipril is a potent orally active converting enzyme inhibitor. Its active metabolite ramiprilat is classified as a reversible, slow- and tight-binding inhibitor. Ramipril lowers blood pressure in various models of hypertension and improves states of acute cardiac failure mainly by suppression of angiotensin II formation. Actions on both vasoconstrictor and volume factors are involved because ramipril causes vasodilation and mild natriuresis but preserves potassium. Sustained inhibition of converting enzyme in target tissues such as vascular wall, kidney and heart may explain cardiovascular changes over the long term. Ancillary effects may possibly emerge from modulation of the sympathetic nervous system but the contribution of bradykinin potentiation remains unclear.
A 19-year-old man with congenital cyanotic heart disease experienced subarachnoid bleeding from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Immediate rebleeding with disordered hemostasis caused by prophylactic anticoagulation treatment was the cause of death. Medical progress in repairing congenital heart disease or attenuating its effects has increased the life expectancy of such patients. Anesthesiologists who are not specialized in this area may find themselves assuming responsibility for these patients during non-cardiac surgery of greater or lesser extension.
Cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline (CDP-choline), as an important intermediate for major membrane phospholipids, may exert neuroprotective effects in various neurodegenerative disorders. This longitudinal proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) study aimed to examine whether a 4-week CDP-choline treatment could alter neurometabolite levels in patients with methamphetamine (MA) dependence and to investigate whether changes in neurometabolite levels would be associated with MA use. We hypothesized that the prefrontal levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), a neuronal marker, and choline-containing compound (Cho), which are related to membrane turnover, would increase with CDP-choline treatment in MA-dependent patients. We further hypothesized that this increase would correlate with the total number of negative urine results. Thirty-one treatment seekers with MA dependence were randomly assigned to receive CDP-choline (n=16) or placebo (n=15) for 4 weeks. Prefrontal NAA and Cho levels were examined using (1)H-MRS before medication, and at 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. Generalized estimating equation regression analyses showed that the rate of change in prefrontal NAA (p=0.005) and Cho (p=0.03) levels were greater with CDP-choline treatment than with placebo. In the CDP-choline-treated patients, changes in prefrontal NAA levels were positively associated with the total number of negative urine results (p=0.03). Changes in the prefrontal Cho levels, however, were not associated with the total number of negative urine results. These preliminary findings suggest that CDP-choline treatment may exert potential neuroprotective effects directly or indirectly because of reductions in drug use by the MA-dependent patients. Further studies with a larger sample size of MA-dependent patients are warranted to confirm a long-term efficacy of CDP-choline in neuroprotection and abstinence.
Zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) are nucleoside analogues administered prenatally in clinical practice, separately or in combination, as antiretroviral drugs to prevent HIV mother-to-child transmission by inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase. In animal studies pre- and/or perinatal exposure to AZT and 3TC induce age- and sex-dependent neurobehavioural alterations in the offspring.
Investigation of short- and medium-term effects of in utero exposure to AZT or 3TC on development of the GABAergic system.
Pregnant CD-1 mice were given orally twice daily AZT (160 mg/kg), 3TC (500 mg/kg) or vehicle solution (NaCl 0.9%) from pregnancy day 10 to delivery. Offspring locomotion and nociceptive sensitivity were examined on postnatal day (pnd) 8, 14, and 28 after administration of two doses of GABAergic agonist muscimol (pnd 8 and 14: 0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg; pnd 28: 0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg). A 30-min locomotor activity test and a 60 s hot-plate test (50+/-1 degrees C) were used.
AZT and 3TC treated mice showed a mild increase of locomotor activity after administration of the high dose muscimol on pnd 8. On pnd 14 the low muscimol dose enhanced locomotor activity in vehicle and 3TC, but not in AZT pups, whereas no prenatal treatment effect was evident on pnd 28. AZT increased nociceptive sensitivity at all ages considered.
Prenatal AZT effects on locomotor activity appear clearly detectable after GABAergic challenge and seem to be transient. AZT effects on pain sensitivity did not appear to be dependent on GABA regulated nociceptive mechanisms. Prenatal 3TC exposure had rather limited effects on locomotor activity development, and no effect on nociception.
Key features of diet-induced obesity are visceral fat deposition, macrophage infiltration and inflammation that can lead to metabolic disorders. This study examined the effects of bardoxolone methyl (BARD) in preventing obesity and inflammation in the visceral fat of mice fed high-fat diet. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), a low-fat diet (LFD, i.e., lab chow diet) or a high-fat diet supplemented with BARD (HFD/BARD) for 21weeks. BARD at a dosage of 10mg/kg body weight was administered orally in drinking water. Histology, immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used for the analysis of epididymal adipose tissue. Morphological results demonstrated that HFD fed mice treated with BARD had smaller adipocytes and fewer macrophages present in epididymal adipose tissue than the HFD group. Furthermore, BARD administration reduced the inflammatory profile in this tissue by increasing the expression of nuclear factor of kappa-light-polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IκB-α) protein and decreasing the protein expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). BARD also prevented oxidative stress reflected by a reduction in stress activated proteins, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), protein kinase B (Akt), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). BARD administration activated the sympathetic nervous system in epididymal adipose tissue assessed by the increased synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). The expression of inflammatory and sympathetic nervous system proteins in BARD mice fed a HFD was equivalent to that of the LFD control mice, indicating the anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity properties of this drug. In conclusion, the oral administration of BARD in HFD mice prevented fat deposition, inflammation and oxidative stress, and improved sympathetic activity in visceral fat. This study suggests a potential therapeutic role of BARD in preventing the development of obesity.
Serial pulmonary angiography with videodensitometry was performed in 18 rats with pulmonary damage caused by administration of a fibrinolysis inhibitor, tranexamic acid (200 mg/kg body weight injected intraperitoneally) and bovine thrombin (500 NIH/kg body weight injected into the right femoral vein). The mean transit time (MTT) was calculated from videodensitometry, the observed area of interest consisting of approximately one-third of the right lung, including both central and peripheral parts. The impact of the pulmonary damage was analysed by morphologic methods and correlated to MTT. Although a pressure rise presumably occurred in the pulmonary circulation, no change in MTT was found after induction of pulmonary damage, indicating opening of actual and potential anastomoses between pulmonary arterioles and venules to serve as by-pass portions and as a safety-valve mechanism for the capillary bed and the right heart, respectively. Another explanation to unchanged MTT may be opening of resting capillary beds. Two rats with very severe pulmonary damage showed prolonged MTT. These rats may have suffered from cardiac failure.
Factors effecting contrast media induced ventricular fibrillation were studied in anesthetized dogs using contact time as the measured parameter. Injections of meglumine/sodium diatrizoate (370 mg I/ml) were made into the right coronary artery at 0.4 ml/s until fibrillation occurred. A contrast medium containing calcium chelators was found to produce fibrillation in a significantly shorter contact time than a similar medium without calcium chelators. Pre-treatment by the cardiac glycoside, ouabain, increased the contact time for fibrillation as did the production of a sub-acute infarction in the left coronary artery and a previous fibrillation and resuscitation. The data suggest that calcium binding additives increase the risk of fibrillation while pre-treatment with cardiac glycosides, the presence of stable infarcts in the non-injected areas, or a previous fibrillation and resuscitation do not increase risk.
The present study investigated the gastroprotective effect of crocin in ethanol-induced gastric injury in rats. Rats were allocated into a normal group, an ulcer group, a crocin-treated group, an ulcer group pretreated with crocin, and an ulcer group pretreated with omeprazole as a reference anti-ulcer drug. Rats were sacrificed 3h after ethanol administration. Prophylactic administration of crocin (50mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 3 consecutive days before the administration of 70% ethanol (10 ml/kg, orally) resulted in significant gastroprotection compared to ethanol-ulcerated rats as manifested by significant reduction in the gastric ulcer index. Crocin pretreatment increased ethanol-lowered levels of gastric juice mucin and mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Moreover, crocin significantly decreased ethanol-elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) level, myeloperoxidase activity and heat shock protein 70 mRNA and protein levels. It also restored ethanol-altered mucosal levels of glutathione, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase activity. Furthermore, crocin-pretreatment alleviated ethanol-induced mucosal apoptosis as revealed by significant down-regulation of cytochrome c and caspase-3 mRNA expression, significant decrease in caspase-3 activity and mitigated DNA fragmentation as indicated by significant decrements in comet parameters. The protective efficacy of crocin was further supported by histological assessment. No significant difference was observed between crocin and omeprazole (20mg/kg orally 1h before ethanol administration) regarding their mucin-secretagogue and antioxidant effects, as well as their effects on TNF-α, IL-6 and cytochrome c. On the other hand, omeprazole was superior in enhancing PGE2 level and in alleviating neutrophil infiltration, caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Conclusively, crocin protects rat gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced injury via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic and mucin-secretagogue mechanisms that are probably mediated by enhanced PGE2 release.
Deregulation of apoptosis, the physiological form of cell death, is closely associated with immunological diseases and cancer. Apoptosis is activated either by death receptor-driven or mitochondrial pathways, both of which may provide potential targets for novel anticancer drugs. Although several ligands stimulating death receptors have been described, the actual molecular events triggering the mitochondrial pathway are largely unknown. Here, we show initiation of apoptosis by gradual depletion of the intracellular coenzyme NAD+. We identified the first low molecular weight compound, designated FK866, which induces apoptosis by highly specific, noncompetitive inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a key enzyme in the regulation of NAD+ biosynthesis from the natural precursor nicotinamide. Interference with this enzyme does not primarily intoxicate cells because the mitochondrial respiratory activity and the NAD+ -dependent redox reactions involved remain unaffected as long as NAD+ is not effectively depleted by catabolic reactions. Certain tissues, however, have a high turnover of NAD+ through its cleavage by enzymes like poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Such cells often rely on the more readily available nicotinamide pathway for NAD+ synthesis and undergo apoptosis after inhibition of NAPRT, whereas cells effectively using the nicotinic acid pathway for NAD+ synthesis remain unaffected. In support of this concept, FK866 effectively induced delayed cell death by apoptosis in HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells with an IC(50) of approximately 1 nM, did not directly inhibit mitochondrial respiratory activity, but caused gradual NAD+ depletion through specific inhibition of NAPRT. This enzyme, when partially purified from K562 human leukemia cells, was noncompetitively inhibited by FK866, and the inhibitor constants were calculated to be 0.4 nM for the enzyme/substrate complex (K(i)) and 0.3 nM for the free enzyme (K(i)'), respectively. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide were both found to have antidote potential for the cellular effects of FK866. FK866 may be used for treatment of diseases implicating deregulated apoptosis such as cancer for immunosuppression or as a sensitizer for genotoxic agents. Furthermore, it may provide an important tool for investigation of the molecular triggers of the mitochondrial pathway leading to apoptosis through enabling temporal separation of NAD+ decrease from ATP breakdown and apoptosis by several days.
