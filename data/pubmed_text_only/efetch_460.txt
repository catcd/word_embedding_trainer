One hundred two patients with recurrent, drug-refractory tachyarrhythmias were treated with amiodarone for nine +/- eight months (mean +/- SD) (range, one to 50 months). Forty-five patients exhibited some form of neurotoxic reaction that was severe enough in nine patients to require discontinuation of treatment or reduction in dosage of the drug. The most frequent neurotoxic findings were tremor (44 patients), peripheral neuropathy (ten patients), and ataxia (seven patients). Five patients developed unusual neurotoxic manifestations: brainstem dysfunction characterized by downbeat nystagmus, hemisensory loss and ataxia, severe dyskinesia, jaw tremor, and proximal myopathy. Neurophysiologic studies revealed varying degrees of predominantly demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Neurotoxic symptoms improved after discontinuing treatment or decreasing the dosage of the drug. Age of the patient and total cumulative dose did not seem to be risk factors for development of neurotoxicity. These neurotoxic findings suggest that amiodarone-induced neurotoxic reactions are not only confined to the peripheral nervous system, but also that parts of the central nervous system (eg, basal ganglia, brain stem, or their connections) may also be involved.
Exposure to the nematocide dibromochloropropane (DBCP) has caused prolonged oligo- and azoospermia in men. There are questions regarding the cellular targets resulting in this effect. In this study we characterized an animal model, in which four daily injections of DBCP produced prolonged oligospermia in LBNF(1) rats without any indication of recovery. Between 6 and 20 weeks after DBCP treatment, 70% of seminiferous tubules showed an epithelium with Sertoli cells but no differentiating germ cells. About 20% of tubules contained differentiating germ cells and 10% showed occlusion or major morphologic alterations to Sertoli cells. Since gonadotropin levels and intratesticular testosterone (ITT) concentrations were elevated in the DBCP-treated rats, the failure of spermatogonial development could not have been a result of lack of these hormones. The tubules without differentiating germ cells contained actively proliferating and dividing type A spermatogonia, which underwent apoptosis instead of differentiation. Thus, the target for the damaging effect appears not to be the killing of stem spermatogonia, but the loss of their ability to undergo differentiation. The presence of type A spermatogonia in the atrophic tubules indicates the potential for intervention to restore spermatogenesis.
Circulating calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) concentrations are elevated in experimental and clinical sepsis. CGRP causes hypotension and tachycardia, suggesting that the peptide might mediate the acute circulatory changes in sepsis. To test this hypothesis we administered Escherichia coli endotoxin (8 mg/kg iv) to Nembutal- (pentobarbital sodium; 50 mg/kg) anesthetized rats. Endotoxin caused hypotension and tachycardia within 60 min that stabilized for 90 min. After 2 h more severe hypotension developed, and 80% of rats died spontaneously after 3 h. In other endotoxic rats we administered 20 nmol of the CGRP receptor antagonist hCGRP (8-37) intravenously at 60 min. hCGRP (8-37) transiently reversed tachycardia (from 469 +/- 11 to 407 +/- 7 beats/min, P < 0.05) and increased mean blood pressure (from 63 +/- 4 to 93 +/- 11 mmHg, P < 0.05) over 30 min, after which hemodynamics and survival rates were no different from untreated animals. The results suggest that CGRP plays an important role in the acute circulatory changes of endotoxemia. More detailed work is necessary to determine the effects of CGRP antagonism on cardiac function, regional blood flow, and overall survival rates in sepsis.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo antitumor action of rosiglitazone (Rosi) alone or in combination with tamoxifen (Tam) on experimental mammary tumors induced by N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals bearing mammary tumors were treated with 0.06 mg/kg/day or 0.12 mg/kg/day of Rosi orally, 1 mg/kg/day of Tam s.c., or with the combined treatment (Rosi+Tam). After 25 days of treatment, the following responses were observed: 45% of tumors were responsive to 0.06 mg/kg/day of Rosi treatment, while 55% of tumors under Tam treatment responded. The results of the combined Rosi+Tam treatment indicated that 75% of tumors were responsive. Similar results were obtained with 0.12 mg/kg/day of Rosi. Apoptosis, necrosis and glandular hypersecretion were observed in Rosi-treated tumors. In all cases, the combined Rosi+Tam treatment potentiated the antitumor effect of Tam alone. No side-effects were observed after treatment at any assayed dose.
1. The effects of the intravenous injection of isoprenaline on heart rate and arterial pressure has been studied in dogs artificially respired with room air or with 12% oxygen-88% nitrogen.2. In dogs breathing room air, isoprenaline in doses from 0.02 to 500 mug/kg increased heart rate and reduced arterial pressure. Ventricular fibrillation was produced in one out of three dogs given 250 mug/kg. This was the only dog breathing room air which was killed by isoprenaline.3. In dogs breathing room air the repeated intravenous injection at 5-min intervals of 2.5 mug/kg increased heart rate and reduced arterial pressure. No ill effects were produced by six doses.4. In dogs respired with 12% oxygen-88% nitrogen the PaO(2) was reduced from 84 to 38 mm Hg with no changes in PaCO(2). In these dogs death was produced by doses of isoprenaline which in dogs breathing room air produced normal responses.5. The fatal dose of isoprenaline (10-50 mug/kg) reduced heart rate and arterial and pulse pressures; sinus rhythm persisted until arterial pressure was less than 50 mm Hg. Ventricular fibrillation did not occur; death occurred from cardiac asystole.6. Death was produced in a similar way in dogs with hypoxaemia by giving four or five doses of isoprenaline (2.5 mug/kg) at 5-min intervals or by two doses of 25 mug/kg.7. The final reduction in arterial pressure during a fatal response resulted from a reduction in cardiac contractility.8. These lethal effects of isoprenaline could be prevented by pretreatment with propranolol.
The acute oral toxicity of palytoxin (PLTX), a highly toxic compound associated with seafood intoxication in tropical and subtropical areas, was investigated in mice. After gavage administration (300-1697 microg/kg) to groups of five female CD-1 mice, signs of toxicity and lethality were recorded for 24 h. The LD(50) was 767 microg/kg (95% confidence limits: 549-1039 microg/kg) and the main symptoms observed were scratching, jumping, respiratory distress and paralysis. Hematoclinical analyses showed increased levels of creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase at doses of 600 microg/kg and above, and aspartate transaminase at 848 microg/kg and above. Histological analysis revealed acute inflammation of the forestomach in mice surviving up to 24h after administration (424-1200 microg/kg). Other histological alterations were observed in the liver and pancreas, while cardiac and skeletal muscle cells revealed only ultrastructural alterations visible by transmission electron microscopy. Ultrastructural and hematoclinical findings suggest an involvement of skeletal and/or cardiac muscle as targets of PLTX, according to the observed human symptoms. A NOEL of 300 microg/kg can be estimated from this acute oral toxicity study.
A renal transplant patient taking prednisone and azathioprine has had repeated episodes of skin infection with the soil saphrophyte Rhodococcus. Human disease with this organism has not been proved before. Although the lesions have always responded to antibiotics, frequent recurrence makes the long-term outlook uncertain.
To elucidate a relationship between lung cancer and tumor induction of environmental chemicals, the presence of 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) in 137 Japanese (97 male and 40 female), and 21 Chinese lung specimens was examined by HPLC, and GC-MS and environmental exposure discussed. Mortality due to lung cancer in Fuyuan County, China, is much higher than that of other cancers. We investigated 21 patients who were residents of Fuyuan County. All were female aged 28-64 years and were non-smoking farmers and cooks. The histological features of the tumors were adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma. The incidence of cancer was due to inhaling soot from the combustion of coal used for cooking and indoor heating. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chrysene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, B[a]P, benzo[g,h,i]perylene and pyrene, but not their nitrated derivatives, were detected in substantial amounts in the resected lungs. These mutagens and carcinogens normally originate in combustion products of coal, and are discussed as the possible initiators of the tumors in the lungs of these patients. All the Japanese lung specimens were also obtained from non-smokers. The concentrations of 1-NP averaged 21.3 +/- 12.4 and 5.9 +/- 2.4 pg/g of Japanese and Chinese samples respectively. The concentrations of B[a]P averaged 180.2 +/- 103.7 and 608.7 +/- 477.1 pg/g of Japanese and Chinese samples respectively. Thus, Japanese and Chinese lung specimens were mainly contaminated by 1-NP and B[a]P, respectively. Typical tissues from a carcinomatous human lung were examined. The patient was a 64-year-old Japanese male non-smoker and farmer who had raised chickens over a period of 40 years. The histological features of the tumor were those of keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. 1-Nitropyrene, 1-nitro-3-hydroxypyrene, 1,3-dinitropyrene and chrysene were detected at concentrations of 0.11, 0.036, 0.095 and 0.16 ng respectively per gram of lung tissue. This cancer was due to long-term exposure to the combustion products of heavy oil used in a chicken house.
The efficacy and tolerability of an infusion of isradipine, a calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine type, were tested in patients in hypertensive crisis. Ten patients with symptomatic and significant elevations in blood pressure were infused for 12 h with isradipine at 1.2, 2.4, 4.8, and 7.2 micrograms/kg/h (3 h of each infusion level). No untoward effects or adverse reactions were noted. No alterations were observed on electrocardiographic tracings, and blood pressure was significantly reduced only at doses of 7.2 micrograms/kg/h. Thus, isradipine as an infusion is useful and safe for hypertensive crisis, starting at a rate of 7.2 micrograms/kg/h. Higher doses may yet prove to be safe, well tolerated, and even more efficacious.
We report an unusual case of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephritis that responded to high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) treatment. A 52-year-old man presented with nephrotic syndrome and was diagnosed to have idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis. At the time of diagnosis, his serum creatinine level was 1.2 mg/dl and daily urine protein excretion was 7.45 g. The patient was initially treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretics. After a 6-month period, the patient remained symptomatic. Therefore, immunosuppressive therapy with a 6-month course of alternating corticosteroids with cyclophosphamide was commenced. Unfortunately, as a sequel of the immunocompromised state, the patient acquired severe pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jiroveci infection when he was on the fourth month of immunosuppressive therapy. At this time, he still had nephrotic range proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. Because of the risk of aggravating infection, immunosuppressive agents were discontinued. A 14-day course of intravenous high-dose TMP-SMX therapy was given for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. With this medication, not only the pneumonia was cured, but also a sustained remission of the nephrotic syndrome occurred. This case suggests a possible therapeutic role of high-dose TMP-SMX in membranous glomerulonephritis. We will discuss the possible mechanism.
Presented is the case of an elderly woman who developed severe hyponatremia while taking tricyclic antidepressants. She met the criteria for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion induced by drugs. Her symptoms of lethargy, weakness, and gastrointestinal disturbances developed insidiously, allowing the hyponatremia to reach severe levels before a diagnosis was made. A variety of psychoactive drugs, most prominently tricyclic antidepressants, have been reported to produce hyponatremia idiosyncratically in elderly persons.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical that has been investigated for it potential to cause prostate diseases. In this study, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 25 or 250 μg/kg BPA from gestational day (GD) 10 to GD21 with or without concurrent indole-3-carbinol (I3C) feeding. I3C is a phytochemical, and it affords chemoprotection against many types of neoplasia. Male F1 rats from different litters were euthanized on post-natal day (PND) 21 and PND180. BPA-treated groups showed a significant increase in histopathological lesions, but I3C feeding reversed many of these changes, mainly at PND180. Maternal I3C feeding increased prostate epithelial apoptosis in the BPA-treated groups and across age groups. Furthermore, I3C induced partial normalization of the prostate histoarchitecture. The results pointed to a protective effect of maternal I3C feeding during pregnancy in the BPA-exposed male offspring, thereby indicating reduction in the harmful effects of gestational BPA imprinting on the prostate.
We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of parkinsonian patients on L-dopa medication, the first one without L-dopa induced dyskinesia (n = 23) and the other with moderate peak-dose dyskinesia (n = 15), and of a group of 14 normal subjects. Single photon emission tomography with i.v. 133Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes. The dyskinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non-dyskinetic parkinsonian patients, with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi- and contralateral primary motor areas. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement, like L-dopa-induced peak dose dyskinesia, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop.
The maternal and perinatal outcome of seven gravidas receiving 2.2-2.5 mg/kg per day of indomethacin for polyhydramnios are reported. Such therapy was started between 26 and 33 weeks of gestational age (mean, 30.4 weeks) and lasted for 20.1 days (range, 2-37 days). Median of amniotic fluid index ranged from 47 at the start of therapy (range, 32-53) to 15 (range, 2-50) when indomethacin was ended. Interval between the end of the therapy and the delivery ranged from 0 to 45 days (mean, 15 days). On average, pregnancies were prolonged by 5.1 weeks (range, 2-8 weeks). The newborn weight was 2678 g on average (range, 620-3700 g). Oligohydramnios was seen in two instances; one patient developed constriction of the fetal ductus arteriosus, which returned to normality after indomethacin suppression; one newborn in which other causes of neonatal bleeding could be excluded, developed a disseminated intravascular coagulation and died 15 h after birth. Finally, one mother presented an acute renal failure immediately after indomethacin administration; this patient completely recovered after indomethacin withdrawal. Thus, the benefit of pregnancy prolongation should be balanced against the increased risks for the newborn, mainly fetal ductus arteriosus constriction and possible bleeding disorders. A causal relationship of indomethacin administration to the latter complication warrants further investigation.
The objective of this study was to compare the tolerability of isradipine and felodipine in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Following a 4-week placebo run-in, 143 patients entered a 12-week double-blind multicenter study. Patients were randomized to receive either isradipine (n = 72) or felodipine (n = 71) at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily. Dose-doubling and the addition of enalapril (2.5 mg once daily) was permitted if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was > 90 mm Hg at weeks 4 and 8, respectively. Isradipine reduced blood pressure from 165/104 +/- 13/6 mm Hg at baseline to 144/88 +/- 13/8 mm Hg at week 12 (P < .001) whereas felodipine reduced blood pressure from 171/104 +/- 17/6 mm Hg at baseline to 150/92 +/- 19/9 mm Hg at week 12 (P < .001). Similar incidences of headache, flushing, dizziness and tachycardia were reported in both groups. However, the incidence of ankle edema was significantly lower in the isradipine group (14% v 30%) (P = .028). It is concluded that isradipine represents a practical improvement over felodipine in the treatment of hypertension.
Hypersensitivity reactions to aspirin and clopidogrel are 2.5% and 1%, respectively. Dual anti-platelet therapy with these drugs is effective in preventing thrombosis following deployment of stents for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular syndromes. Desensitization therapy with both aspirin and clopidogrel may be required for patients undergoing stent implantation that have experienced hypersensitivity to these agents. We report the case of a 58-year-old woman who developed urticaria and angioedema following aspirin therapy for ischaemic cerebrovascular disease. She developed an identical reaction after clopidogrel was subsequently administered. Investigations revealed the presence of an internal carotid artery aneurysm that required deployment of a stent. Rapid desensitization to aspirin over 5.5 h followed 3 days later by rapid desensitization to clopidogrel over 2.5 h was successfully performed prior to stenting. After 4 months she has tolerated this dual anti-platelet therapy without any adverse reaction. Rapid and sequential desensitization to both aspirin and clopidogrel can be successfully performed for patients who require stent deployment but have hypersensitivity to both these anti-platelet agents.
Sixty-eight children 2 months to 14 years of age were admitted with status epilepticus to Sultan Qaboos University Hospital from November 1993 to December 2001. Thirty-eight children (55.9%) had refractory status epilepticus and 30 (44.1%) had established status epilepticus. The children with refractory status epilepticus had received intravenous or per rectal diazepam and intravenous phenytoin/phenobarbital (either or both) before continuous infusion of midazolam was given. Fifty-one children received continuous midazolam infusion. In 38 children with refractory status epilepticus, the midazolam infusion was given in addition to the long-acting antiepilepsy drug, whereas 13 (18.8%) children needed only midazolam to control the established status epilepticus. Seventeen (25%) children were controlled with phenytoin sodium alone. Midazolam was given 0.15 mg/kg/minute initially as bolus in 1 minute, followed by 1 to 7 microg/kg/minute as continuous infusion. The status could not be controlled in one child (1.5%) suffering from neurodegenerative disease. Two children needed mechanical ventilation following prolonged apnea after diazepam administration in one and diazepam plus phenobarbital in the other. No metabolic derangements or compromise of vital functions was noted on midazolam infusion. All children made a complete recovery. There was one death related to meningoencephalitis.
The aim of this study was to compare, retrospectively, the value of chronic bilateral stimulation of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with young onset Parkinson's disease. We selected 13 consecutive patients with similar characteristics at the time of surgery: age at onset < 40 years, disabling motor fluctuations (Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 or 5 in off-drug phases) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). Eight patients were operated on in the STN and five in the GPi. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), timed motor tests and a LID scale were compared in on- and off-drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery on stimulation using the chronic electrical parameters found to improve best the motor state of the individual patient, without adverse effects. In off-drug phases, the motor score of the UPDRS was improved by 71% with STN stimulation and by 39% with GPi stimulation on average. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Whereas rigidity and tremor showed good improvement in both groups, the decrease in the akinesia score was more pronounced in the STN group. In the STN group, the improvement of all motor symptoms was very close, or equal, to the best levodopa response. Thus the levodopa test was predictive of outcome. The improvement in off-drug period motor handicap allowed a decrease in the levodopa-equivalent dose only in the STN group (-56%). The voltage, frequency and pulse width used for chronic stimulation were lower in the STN group. In the on-drug phases there was a marked improvement in LID in the GPi group, as measured by the dyskinesias score during an acute levodopa test, whereas there was only a small decrease in the STN group (P < 0.05). However, in the long term, the reduction of levodopa dosage in the STN group led to an indirect reduction of LID similar to that in the GPi group during activities of everyday life. In conclusion, the overall results favour the neurosurgical treatment of Parkinson's disease by stimulating the STN rather than the GPi.
Connexins (Cxs) are a family of transmembrane proteins that form gap junctions with unique and redundant biophysical functions. Juxtaglomerular cells express Cx40, which is crucial to the control of renin secretion by blood pressure and angiotensin II, and mice that lack Cx40 have high plasma renin and hypertension. To examine whether normal juxtaglomerular cell function depends on the unique properties of Cx40, we measured renin release in mice where the coding sequence for Cx40 was replaced by that for Cx45, using the knock-in method. We first found that the knock-in strategy indeed resulted in expression of Cx45 but not Cx40 in the juxtaglomerular cells of these mice. The plasma renin concentration of the knock-in mice was similar to that in wild-type mice. The high blood pressure of the Cx40 knockout mice was significantly reduced when Cx45 was knocked into the locus but remained mildly elevated compared to wild-type mice. Blockade of angiotensin II formation by enalapril increased the plasma renin concentration in wild-type and the Cx45 knock-in mice but not in the Cx40 knockout mice. Infusion of angiotensin II into isolated perfused kidneys results in decreased renin release, a phenomenon that was attenuated in the Cx40 knockout mice. However, in the Cx45 knock-in mice, angiotensin II suppressed renin release similar to its effect in wild type mice. Unilateral renal artery stenosis increased the plasma renin concentration and blood pressure in both the wild-type and the Cx45 knock-in mice but not in the Cx40 knockout mice. Since Cx40 can be replaced by Cx45, a connexin with a significantly lower conductivity, we suggest that the regulation of renin release is not dependent on the unique electrical properties of these channel proteins.
A total of 44 patients with previously untreated; non-resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with 4'-iodo-4'-deoxydoxorubicin (IDX), which is an analogue of doxorubicin with less cardiotoxicity. Patients received 80 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks. Dose reductions were carried out for haematological toxicity. Response was assessed prior to each treatment according to WHO criteria. Among the 43 evaluable patients, 1 (2%; 95% confidence limits, 0-8%) achieved a partial response. Leucocytopenia of WHO grade 3 or 4 occurred in 64% of patients and corresponding thrombocytopenia grade 3 or 4 occurred in 30%. Of the 26 patients who were evaluated by measurements of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 4 had a decline in LVEF of more than 15%, and 2 patients developed congestive heart failure. Myocardial biopsies were not done. In conclusion, IDX is not active in NSCLC at the applied dose and on the schedule used. Moreover, it does not seem possible to increase the dose intensity further due to the observed toxicity.
Eicosanoids are believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of several models of glomerular disease. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin reduces proteinuria in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or other glomerular diseases. We have shown that sera of some patients with FSGS significantly increase glomerular albumin permeability (Palb) in an in vitro assay.
To determine the role of eicosanoids in the increased Palb caused by the FSGS factor, glomeruli were isolated from normal rats, preincubated with indomethacin, then incubated with FSGS serum or normal serum and Palb was calculated. To study the direct effect of individual eicosanoids on Palb, glomeruli were incubated with prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2alpha or a thromboxane A2 mimetic, and Palb was calculated. In the final set of experiments, normal glomeruli were preincubated with the thromboxane synthase inhibitor furegrelate, incubated with FSGS serum, and Palb was calculated.
Preincubation of isolated glomeruli with either the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the thromboxane synthase inhibitor furegrelate protected glomeruli from the increase in Palb caused by FSGS serum. Each of the three principal glomerular eicosanoids significantly increased Palb of isolated glomeruli.
These studies implicate a product of the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism as mediating the increased Palb caused by FSGS serum in our in vitro assay and possibly the proteinuria seen in patients with FSGS.
Human malignant brain tumors have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy. Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers, separating two congruent networks of water channels. Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs, the gel-like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity. For human glioblastoma recurrences, the feasibility, safety, and short-term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study. A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a glioblastoma multiforme underwent re-resection and received an intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin cubic phases in different dosages. Six of the patients received more than 15 mg paclitaxel and suffered from moderate to severe brain edema, while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg paclitaxel. In the latter group, brain edema was markedly reduced and dealt medically. Intracavitary chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma using cubic phases is feasible and safe, yet the clinical benefit remains to be examined in a clinical phase II study.
Haloperidol-induced c-Fos expression in the lateral part of the neostriatum has been correlated with motor side effects while c-Fos induction in the medial part of the neostriatum and the nucleus accumbens is thought to be associated with the therapeutic effects of the drug. Induction of c-Fos in the striatum by haloperidol involves dopamine D(2) (DA D(2)) receptor antagonism and is dependent on activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and L-type Ca(2+) channels. In the current study, pretreatment with L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers suppressed haloperidol-induced c-Fos throughout the neostriatum and the nucleus accumbens at 2 h postinjection. However, elevated c-Fos protein expression was observed only in the lateral part of the neostriatum at 5 h postinjection of haloperidol following pretreatment of L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker compared with rats pretreated with vehicle alone. In addition, pretreatment prolonged the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. Infusions of L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers directly into the neostriatum mimicked similar patterns of changes in haloperidol-induced c-Fos expression. Prolonged expression of c-Fos was not observed following coadministration of nifedipine and a dopamine D(1) (DA D(1)) receptor agonist, SKF 81297, but could be mimicked by the DA D(2/3) receptor antagonist raclopride, suggesting that the phenomenon is likely related to DA D(2) receptor antagonism. Moreover, the expression levels of haloperidol-induced zif 268 and haloperidol-induced phosphorylated CREB and phosphorylated Elk-1 were also substantially elevated for a prolonged period of time in the lateral, but not the medial part of the neostriatum, following blockade of L-type Ca(2+) channels. Collectively, the results suggest that coadministration of L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers affects haloperidol signaling in the lateral part of the neostriatum and may exacerbate the development of acute motor side effects.
Heparin therapy has become widespread during the past few years. Consequently, the haemorrhagic complications of this therapy have become more common. In some cases, the clinical manifestations do not directly recall the haemorrhagic episode but rather, they simulate intercurrent pathologies. This is the case with femoral neuropathy from psoas haematoma which we refer to here.
We studied the effect of high-cholesterol diet and factors inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase on the development of liver fibrosis in C57Bl/6 mice with CCl4- or zymosan-induced hepatitis. Feeding a high-cholesterol diet led to a sharp increase in collagen content in the liver tissue of animals with CCl4-induced or zymosan-induced hepatitis. Atorvastatin and calcitriol produced less pronounced fibrogenic effects. Mevalonate partially prevented the development of cholesterol-induced fibrogenesis. High-cholesterol diet led to accumulation of oxysterols, cholesterol esters, and triglycerides and increased the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA in liver tissue. Cholesterol-induced potentiation of the fibrogenic response is probably associated with transforming growth factor-beta1 induction due to accumulation of lipids and oxysterols in the liver.
Eating a "Westernized" diet high in fat and sugar leads to weight gain and numerous health problems, including the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Rodent studies have shown that resveratrol supplementation reduces blood glucose levels, preserves β-cells in islets of Langerhans, and improves insulin action. Although rodent models are helpful for understanding β-cell biology and certain aspects of T2DM pathology, they fail to reproduce the complexity of the human disease as well as that of nonhuman primates. Rhesus monkeys were fed a standard diet (SD), or a high-fat/high-sugar diet in combination with either placebo (HFS) or resveratrol (HFS+Resv) for 24 months, and pancreata were examined before overt dysglycemia occurred. Increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin resistance occurred in both HFS and HFS+Resv diets compared with SD. Although islet size was unaffected, there was a significant decrease in β-cells and an increase in α-cells containing glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1 with HFS diets. Islets from HFS+Resv monkeys were morphologically similar to SD. HFS diets also resulted in decreased expression of essential β-cell transcription factors forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), NKX6-1, NKX2-2, and PDX1, which did not occur with resveratrol supplementation. Similar changes were observed in human islets where the effects of resveratrol were mediated through Sirtuin 1. These findings have implications for the management of humans with insulin resistance, prediabetes, and diabetes.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been postulated to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury and diabetes. Diabetes is a major risk factor and also common amongst the people who suffer from stroke. In this study, we have investigated the neuroprotective potential of sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (SPB; 30-300mg/kg), a chemical chaperone by targeting ER stress in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia associated with comorbid type 2 diabetes. Intraperitoneal treatment with SPB (100 and 300mg/kg) significantly ameliorated brain I/R damage as evidenced by reduction in cerebral infarct and edema volume. It also significantly improved the functional recovery of various neurobehavioral impairments (neurological deficit score, grip strength and rota rod) evoked by I/R compared with vehicle-treatment. Further, SPB (100mg/kg) significantly reduced the DNA fragmentation as shown by prominent reduction in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. This effect was observed concomitantly with significant attenuation in upregulation of 78kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein or growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (CHOP/GADD153) and activation of caspase-12, specific markers of ER stress/apoptosis. The neuroprotection observed with SPB was independent of its effect on cerebral blood flow and blood glucose. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the neuroprotective effect of SPB owing to amelioration of ER stress and DNA fragmentation. It also suggest that targeting ER stress might offer a promising therapeutic approach and benefits against ischemic stroke associated with comorbid type 2 diabetes.
