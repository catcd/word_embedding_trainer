At very low doses the GABA agonists SL 76002 and muscimol diminish haloperidol-induced catalepsy. At somewhat higher doses these compounds potentiate catalepsy. Biphasic effects on DA-receptor mediated functions have previously been noted with bicuculline and picrotoxinin. In contrast, manipulation of GABA levels by enzyme inhibition induced only a monophasic effect on dopamine-mediated behaviour. The potentiation of GABA levels by enzyme inhibition induced only a monophasic effect on dopamine-mediated behaviour. The potentiation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy by GABA mimetics is also observed with dipropylacetate, delta-aminovaleric acid and gamma-acetylenic GABA. This GABA-mimetic potentiation of catakepsy was blocked by the coadministration of bicuculline. These results confirm and extend the hypothesis that GABA-neurons influence DA neuron function. Furthermore they suggest that more than one group of GABA receptors influence directly and/or indirectly DA neuronal function, with different resultant effects.
Emesis is the most feared side effect in patients who are undergoing cancer chemotherapy. In particular, cisplatin causes severe acute and delayed emesis. Although early vomiting is well controlled by 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonists, delayed-phase vomiting is not sufficiently controlled. Substance P is thought to be involved in the development of emesis, and tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonists can inhibit delayed vomiting. We previously have reported that substance P is involved in the paclitaxel-induced hypersensitivity reaction in rats, and anti-allergic agent pemirolast reduces these reactions via inhibition of substance P release. In the present study, we investigated the effect of pemirolast on cisplatin-induced kaolin intake, which is an index of nausea/vomiting in the rat. Cisplatin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced kaolin intake and reduced normal feed intake from days 1 to 5 after injection. Cisplatin-induced kaolin intake was significantly reduced by co-administration of ondansetron (2 mg/kg, i.p.), a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone (2 mg/kg, i.p.) from days 1 to 5. Similarly, pemirolast (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and the tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist aprepitant (10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced cisplatin-induced kaolin intake on days 3 and 4. Moreover, pemirolast at the same dose significantly reversed the cisplatin-induced increase in the cerebrospinal fluid level of substance P in rats. These results suggest that substance P is involved in cisplatin-induced kaolin intake in rats, and pemirolast reduces kaolin intake by inhibition of substance P release.
The present study assessed the impact of time (6 h) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) during isoflurane anesthesia with and without vasopressor administration. All animals were prepared for measurement of CBF by the radiolabeled microsphere method under 1.4% end-tidal (1.0 MAC) isoflurane anesthesia. Surgery required 45 min and was followed by a 15 min stabilization period. In group 1 (n = 6), isoflurane 1.4% was administered for 6 h. CBF after 1 h of isoflurane was 92 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g (mean +/- SEM) and declined to 61 +/- 5 ml/min/100 g at 2 h and further declined to 37 +/- 5 ml/min/100 g at 6 hr. In group 2 (n = 6), isoflurane 1.4% was administered during the first hour. Thereafter, isoflurane 1.4% was continued, angiotensin II (0.3 mug/kg/min) was administered intravenously, and blood was withdrawn to maintain CPP constant for an additional 5 h, with hourly CBF determination. In this group, control CBF was 95 +/- 16 ml/min/100 g and flow was maintained at the control level through 4 h and then declined to 50 +/- 5 ml/min/100 g at 5 and 6 h. In group 3 (n = 6), 1.4% isoflurane was administered and phenylephrine (2.0 mug/kg/min) infusion was combined with hemorrhage to maintain control CPP in an identical sequence to group 2. In group 3, control CBF was 88 +/- 14 ml/min/100 g. As in group 1, CBF decreased significantly at 2 h (p < 0.05) to 68 +/- 13 ml/min/100 g and further declined to 49 +/- 7 ml/min/100 g at 6 h. In all three groups, CMRO2 remained at control levels and there were no changes in arterial carbon dioxide or CPP for the duration of the study. These data demonstrate that the hyperemia caused by isoflurane resolves over time during stable 1 MAC isoflurane anesthesia. The unanticipated interaction of angiotensin II and isoflurane producing a sustained cerebral hyperemia suggests that previous studies that used angiotensin II to support MABP during isoflurane may have reported the effects of angiotensin II in addition to or rather than the effects of isoflurane.
To examine the association of prescribed zidovudine (ZDV) during pregnancy with congenital anomalies in a population-based cohort.
Medicaid claims were used to assess prescribed ZDV and children's major congenital anomalies in 1932 liveborn deliveries from 1993 to 1996 to HIV-infected women in the state of New York (NYS), U.S.A. Prevalence of anomalies in the cohort was compared with that of a general NYS population. Within the cohort, adjusted odds of any anomaly were compared by receipt of ZDV and by trimester of first prescription.
The adjusted prevalence of any anomaly in the study cohort was 2.76 times greater than in the general population (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.36-3. 17). Children of study women who were prescribed ZDV had increased adjusted odds of any anomaly (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.55; 95% CI, 1.01-2.29). Adjusted ORs (with CIs) by trimester of first prescription were 1.20 (0.58-2.51), 1.47 (0.85-2.55), and 1.84 (1. 04-3.25) for the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively.
Children of HIV-infected women in this cohort had a greater prevalence of major anomalies than did the general NYS population. An increased risk of major anomalies was not evident for first trimester exposure when the association would have been most biologically plausible.
A 64-year-old woman developed biopsy-proven hepatitis during oral treatment of severe pustular psoriasis of palms and soles with an aromatic retinoid, etretinate. The elevations in hepatic enzyme levels reappeared when etretinate was reinstituted 18 months later. Analysis of serum and subcutis showed normal therapeutic concentrations of the drug. Isotretinoin therapy, although apparently devoid of hepatotoxicity, was clinically only marginally effective. Evidence compiled from the literature suggests that etretinate-hepatitis is a drug-specific reaction.
This case report serves to emphasize two important features of metastatic breast carcinoma. First, that tamoxifen-induced flare, although a rare and self-limiting phenomenon, may be fatal and must thus be recognized and treated promptly. Secondly, those patients presenting with hypercalcaemia, as part of tamoxifen-induced tumour flare, invariably have metastatic disease but they may enjoy a durable prognosis if this is confined to the skeleton.
Pleiotrophin (PTN), a neurotrophic factor with important roles in survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons, is up-regulated in the nucleus accumbens after amphetamine administration suggesting that PTN could modulate amphetamine-induced pharmacological or neuroadaptative effects. To test this hypothesis, we have studied the effects of amphetamine administration in PTN genetically deficient (PTN -/-) and wild type (WT, +/+) mice. In conditioning studies, we found that amphetamine induces conditioned place preference in both PTN -/- and WT (+/+) mice. When these mice were re-evaluated after a 5-day period without amphetamine administration, we found that WT (+/+) mice did not exhibit amphetamine-seeking behaviour, whereas, PTN -/- mice still showed a robust drug-seeking behaviour. In immunohystochemistry studies, we found that amphetamine (10 mg/kg, four times, every 2 hours) causes a significant increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein positive cells in the striatum of amphetamine-treated PTN -/- mice compared with WT mice 4 days after last administration of the drug, suggesting an enhanced amphetamine-induced astrocytosis in the absence of endogenous PTN. Interestingly, we found in concomitant in vitro studies that PTN (3 µM) limits amphetamine (1 mM)-induced loss of viability of PC12 cell cultures, effect that could be related to the ability of PTN to induce the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. To test this possibility, we used specific Akt and ERK1/2 inhibitors uncovering for the first time that PTN-induced protective effects against amphetamine-induced toxicity in PC12 cells are mediated by the ERK1/2 signalling pathway. The data suggest an important role of PTN to limit amphetamine-induced neurotoxic and rewarding effects.
Dietary fat quality may influence skeletal muscle lipid processing and fat accumulation, thereby modulating insulin sensitivity.
The objective was to examine the acute effects of meals with various fatty acid (FA) compositions on skeletal muscle FA processing and postprandial insulin sensitivity in obese, insulin-resistant men.
In a single-blind, randomized, crossover study, 10 insulin-resistant men consumed 3 high-fat mixed meals (2.6 MJ), which were high in SFAs, MUFAs, or PUFAs. Fasting and postprandial skeletal muscle FA processing was examined by measuring differences in arteriovenous concentrations across the forearm muscle. [²H₂]Palmitate was infused intravenously to label endogenous triacylglycerol and FFAs in the circulation, and [U-¹³C]palmitate was added to the meal to label chylomicron-triacylglycerol. Skeletal muscle biopsy samples were taken to assess intramuscular lipid metabolism and gene expression.
Insulin and glucose responses (AUC) after the SFA meal were significantly higher than those after the PUFA meal (P = 0.006 and 0.033, respectively). Uptake of triacylglycerol-derived FAs was lower in the postprandial phase after the PUFA meal than after the other meals (AUC₆₀₋₂₄₀; P = 0.02). The fractional synthetic rate of the triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and phospholipid pool was higher after the MUFA meal than after the SFA meal. PUFA induced less transcriptional downregulation of oxidative pathways than did the other meals.
PUFAs reduced triacylglycerol-derived skeletal muscle FA uptake, which was accompanied by higher postprandial insulin sensitivity, a more transcriptional oxidative phenotype, and altered intramyocellular lipid partitioning and may therefore be protective against the development of insulin resistance.
Menkes disease (MD) is an X-linked recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in a copper-transporting p-type ATPase (ATP7A) that normally delivers copper to the central nervous system. The precise reasons for neurodegeneration in MD are poorly understood. We hypothesized that gene expression changes in a MD patient with a lethal ATP7A mutation would indicate pathophysiological cascades relevant to the effects of copper deficiency in the developing brain. To test this hypothesis, oligonucleotide probes for 12,000 genes arrayed on Affymetrix Human Genome U95 GeneChips were used for expression profiling of fluorescently labeled primary cRNAs from post-mortem cerebral cortex and cerebellum of a MD patient who died at 6 months of age and a normal control brain matched for age, gender, and race. Histopathologic analysis of the proband's brain showed preservation of neuronal integrity and no hypoxic effects. However, cerebrospinal fluid and brain copper levels were subnormal, and expression profiling identified over 350 known dysregulated genes. For a subset of genes (approximately 12%) analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, the correct cross-validation rate was 88%. Thirty known genes were altered in both cortex and cerebellum. Downregulation of genes involved in myelination, energy metabolism, and translation was the major finding. The cerebellum was more sensitive to copper deficiency.
Muscimol is a potent agonist at GABA-inhibitory synapses in mammalian brain. Given systemically at 7 mumol per kilogram, it blocks topical penicillin seizures and delays the onset of generalized metrazol convulsions in rats. It has no effect against generalized seizures caused by picrotoxin or strychnine. Higher doses of muscimol cause bradykinesia, ataxia, catatonic posturing, and slowing of the electroencephalogram. When applied topically to cortex, muscimol blocks focal penicillin, bicuculline, and picrotoxin discharges in a dose-response relationship. It has no effect against topical strychnine. Muscimol offers a potential new approach to the treatment of epilepsy.
The sensitivity and electrophysiological patterns of paroxysmal activity induced in different brain structures by topical application of penicillin-G were evaluated in the rat. Recordings were carried out in five groups of animals, in telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, rombencephalon and spinal cords. The following analysis were carried out: frequency distribution histograms, latency and time course duration of paroxysmal activity, duration and amplitude of epileptic bursts. The results obtained showed that the nervous structures tested with penicillin-G had a different epileptogenic sensitivity and response pattern which significantly changed along the cerebral cortex-spinal cord axis. The highest epileptic sensitivity was observed in somatosensory cortex (SI) at 500-600 microns depth; in the other cortical layers, a significant lenghtening in latency was observed. Among the other structures, the spinal cord seemed to be the most sensitive target to the epileptogenic action of penicillin-G, whereas in the remaining structures, sensitivity significantly decreased in rostro-caudal direction. As far as the features of the paroxysmal activity are concerned, significant differences among tested structures were observed. In particular, within the SI cortex, the main differences were represented by the gradual increase in burst frequency and voltage from the surface to the IVth layer and by their subsequent decrease in deeper layers (V-VI). In the diencephalon, the paroxysmal activity was similar to that observed in more superficial and deeper cortical layers even though epileptic bursts showed a lower amplitude. Mesencephalon and rombencephalon displayed a paroxysmal activity with a distinctive feature, characterized by long lasting bursts of low amplitude, although bulbar outbursts showed a shorter duration than the mesencephalic ones. In the spinal cord, the epileptiform activity displayed a different paroxysmal pattern, characterized by the longest duration and the highest amplitude. The different sensitivities of the investigated brain structures to penicillin-G and the characteristics of the induced paroxysmal activity have been extensively discussed.
The effect of graded, progressive hypotension on the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow was studied in anaesthetized baboons with experimental renovascular hypertension. Graded hypotension was induced over a period of 5-6 h by the administration of increasing concentrations of halothane. In these chronically hypertensive animals cerebral blood flow remained constant until the mean arterial pressure had decreased to approximately 90 mm Hg. At mean arterial pressures of less than this value cerebral blood flow was pressure passive. At the completion of the investigation the brains were fixed by perfusion and submitted to neuropathological examination. Evidence of chronic hypertension and of ischaemic brain damage was found in every animal.
Leukotriene receptor antagonists have demonstrated clinical benefits in chronic asthma studies of up to 3 months in duration. The effects of these agents over extended periods of time have not been reported.
To describe the long-term effect of oral montelukast, a potent and specific cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, compared with inhaled corticosteroids in both adult and paediatric patients with chronic asthma.
Male and female patients with chronic, stable asthma (adults aged 15-85 years, children aged 6-14 years), who had completed double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies, participated in three extension studies with oral montelukast taken once daily (10 mg tablet for adults, 5 mg chewable tablet for paediatric patients) or inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 200 microg twice daily for adults, beclomethasone 100 microg or equivalent three times daily for children). A double-blind adult extension study was 37 weeks in duration; open-label adult extension studies were 156 (adults) and 112 (paediatric) weeks in duration. A total of 436, 374, and 245 patients entered these extension studies, respectively.
Treatment with both montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids resulted in improvement in multiple parameters of asthma control. Improvements in daytime symptom scores were generally comparable among treatment groups. No tachyphylaxis to the effects of montelukast was evident. In the adult open-label study, however, the effect of beclomethasone on mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) gradually decreased from start of the study to the end of the follow-up treatment period.
Both montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids were effective in controlling mild to moderate chronic asthma; the relative effectiveness of montelukast and beclomethasone were similar in open-label conditions. The hypothesis, that clinical practice conditions (e.g., adherence) may have a significant impact on the effectiveness of these therapies, should be tested in future clinical trials.
Indinavir is a new specific and potent drug that inhibits, like other antiretroviral agents, the protease of immune deficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), an enzyme necessary to maduration and replication of the virus. Indinavir has the capacity to bind the active site causing a decrease in plasma of HIV1-RNA and an increase of T-CD4 helper lymphocytes. The aim of this work is to study in HIV and/or AIDS patients treated with indinavir the crystalluria and the formation of renal calculi due to the clearance of this drug. Two out of nine patients studied in this work presented abundant crystalluria and one of them presented spontaneously passed renal stone. Urinary crystals were studied under polarized-light microscopy and renal stone was analyzed by infrared spectroscopy.
In this paper, three cases of grand mal seizures are reported as a complication of pefloxacin at usual doses (400 mg twice a day) in patients with cirrhosis. Grand mal seizures occurred from 12 h to 8 days after the onset of pefloxacin treatment. In 1 case, seizures recurred after inadvertent rechallenge with the drug. Elevated pefloxacin serum levels were demonstrated in 2 cases. Brain computed tomography in all 3 cases and cerebrospinal fluid examination showed normal results. No etiology other than pefloxacin overdose was found. After pefloxacin withdrawal, no recurrence of seizures were observed. Therefore, when pefloxacin treatment is indicated for cirrhotic patients, a reduced dosage and/or careful monitoring of pefloxacin serum levels should be recommended.
Initial clinical findings are reported for the 3339 young women enrolled in the Diethylstilbestrol Adenosis (DESAD) project. Changes in the vaginal mucosa (VEC--vaginal epithelial changes), which were detected by colposcopy or iodine staining, occurred in 34% of 1275 participants identified by review of prenatal records 59% of participants who themselves requested entry into the project, and 65% of participants referred by a physician. Analysis of data on the 298 women who were identified by record review and whose prenatal records contained complete information about drug exposure indicated that VEC is most closely associated with the timing of the onset of intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), total dose, and length of exposure. Frequency of VEC was also found to decrease with age. No instances of severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, invasive squamous cell adenocarcinoma, or clear cell carcinoma were observed among the women identified by record review.
Guggulsterone is a plant polyphenol traditionally used to treat obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and osteoarthritis, possibly through an anti-inflammatory mechanism. Whether this steroid has any role in cancer is not known. In this study, we found that guggulsterone inhibits the proliferation of wide variety of human tumor cell types including leukemia, head and neck carcinoma, multiple myeloma, lung carcinoma, melanoma, breast carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Guggulsterone also inhibited the proliferation of drug-resistant cancer cells (e.g., gleevac-resistant leukemia, dexamethasone-resistant multiple myeloma, and doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells). Guggulsterone suppressed the proliferation of cells through inhibition of DNA synthesis, producing cell cycle arrest in S-phase, and this arrest correlated with a decrease in the levels of cyclin D1 and cdc2 and a concomitant increase in the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and p27. Guggulsterone-induced apoptosis as indicated by increase in the number of Annexin V- and TUNEL-positive cells, through the downregulation of anti-apoptototic products. The apoptosis induced by guggulsterone was also indicated by the activation of caspase-8, bid cleavage, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 activation, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage. The apoptotic effects of guggulsterone were preceded by activation of JNK and downregulation of Akt activity. JNK was needed for guggulsterone-induced apoptosis, inasmuch as inhibition of JNK by pharmacological inhibitors or by genetic deletion of MKK4 (activator of JNK) abolished the activity. Overall, our results indicate that guggulsterone can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through the activation of JNK, suppression of Akt, and downregulation of antiapoptotic protein expression.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old woman, heavy smoker, who received 500 micrograms i.m. of Sulprostone, a synthetic PGE2-derivative, to induce pregnancy termination. Sulprostone is usually administered either to cause abortion in preparation of an instrumental operation or to induce delivery after the intrauterine death of the fetus. This drug has a dilating effect on the cervix uteri and stimulates the uterus muscles. After about fifteen minutes the patient experienced a constrictive chest pain which progressively worsened and spread to the upper limbs. The pain disappeared for a short period and then recurred with greater intensity, accompanied by bradycardia and hypotension. The ECG showed sinus bradycardia, second- and third-degree atrioventricular block, S-T segment elevation in the inferior leads and reciprocal depression in the anterior leads. Intravenous nitroglycerin therapy induced a rapid reduction of the clinical symptoms and changes in the ECG. There was no increase in cardiac enzymes. The exercise test, the cold pressor test and the ECO-dipyridamole test were negative. The patient refused to undergo the ergonovine test and coronary angiography. We hypothesize that the Sulprostone either had a dipyridamole-like effect or that it induced a paradoxal coronary spasm.
Because the rate of malignancies in young women exposed in utero to diethylstilbesterol (DES) is low, appropriate population screening methods have not been established. A case is presented that is believed to represent the first reported instance of a DES-exposed daughter who developed clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina after initially negative examinations. The patient was followed with Papanicolaou smears, pelvic examinations, and colposcopy every 6 months for 2 years prior to the discovery of malignancy. Initially negative, Papanicolaou smears successfully predicted the presence of an early adenocarcinoma. Palpation aided by colposcopy allowed directed biopsy of the small asymptomatic lesion. This case underscores the necessity for frequent vaginal cytologic smears and pelvic examinations at intervals no greater than 6 months. Colposcopy is indicated to direct biopsies when an abnormal cytologic smears is reported or when abnormal bleeding or discharge occurs. Biopsy of any palpable lesion is mandatory.
The value of frequent routine screening of in utero diethylstilbestrol-exposed women has not been established because of lack of documented reports of patients with initially negative examinations who later developed malignancy. LB, a 19-year-old nulligravida with a history of drug exposure in utero, was 1st evaluated for vaginal adenosis at age 15. The patient was followed with Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, pelvic examination, and colposcopy every 6 months for 2 years before malignancy was discovered. After initially negative Pap smears, the patient's smears were classified as Class III 2 years later, and she was referred to the hospital where colposcopy revealed a cervical collar and extensive columnar ectopy covering the entire cervix. A transformation zone, extending onto the upper third of the vagina, showed epithelial and vascular changes characteristic of immature squamous metaplasia. A directed biopsy (aided by palpation) of the area uncovered a clear cell carcinoma. Reactive hyperplasia was present in multiple lymph nodes, and surgery (radical hysterectomy, total vaginectomy, and vaginal reconstruction) was performed. At 24 weeks postoperation, the patient was sexually active and orgasmic, and 1 year postoperation was clinically free of disease, asymptommatic, and enrolled in college, where follow-up continues. This case underscores the necessity for frequent vaginal cytologic smears and pelvic examinations at intervals no greater than 6 months. Biopsy of any palpable lesion is mandatory.
From 1972-1974, 228 children began treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia and were prospectively assessed for neurologic complications. After CNS irradiation (2,400 rad) and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX), they received weekly intravenous maintenance therapy with MTX alone (40-60 mg/m2; 20 patients) or MTX (10-30 mg/m2) with other drugs (208 patients). Signs of leukoencephalopathy appeared in 11 children (nine without CNS leukemia) after 4-15 months of IV MTX alone, and included lethargy, seizures, spasticity, paresis, drooling, and dementia. Before or during the clinical onset, EEG frequencies slowed (all ten patients tested). Radionuclide scans showed periventricular accumulation of 99mTc (9/11 patients) and remained abnormal for greater than or equal to six months in eight patients. Cranial computed tomograms or neuropathology findings (five patients each) demonstrated leukoencephalopathy (nine patients) and radiation-related microangiopathy (ten patients). Severe neurologic and neuropsychologic dysfunctions were present in four long-term survivors.
Methamphetamine (METH) abuse is associated with "METH mouth", characterized by rampant dental decay and destruction of periodontal bone and soft tissues. In periodontitis, monocyte/macrophages, stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), produce interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), contributing to bone and soft tissue degradation. Effects of METH on monocyte/macrophages and its role in periodontitis are unknown. The objective of this study was to determine METH cytotoxicity and effects on constitutive and LPS-stimulated IL-1beta production in THP-1 human monocytes. METH significantly reduced cell viability, assessed by activity of a mitochondrial enzyme, by 20-40% after 24h, with recovery at longer periods. Brief exposure to METH caused <10% cytotoxicity (measured by an assay that detects membrane damage). LPS from E. coli or the periodontopathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. n.) significantly increased IL-1beta production (measured by ELISA). Despite cytotoxicity of some METH concentrations, METH had no significant effect on constitutive IL-1beta production. However, METH generally increased LPS-stimulated IL-1beta levels, reaching statistical significance at 5x10(-5)M METH ( approximately 50% to >100% increase). The study suggests that METH potentiation of periodontopathogen LPS stimulation of IL-1beta in monocytes could contribute to periodontitis in METH abusers, consistent with other studies suggesting a role for increased IL-1beta in deleterious effects of METH.
To assess therapeutic effect and toxicity of D-penicillamine in relation to HLA antigens, 111 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were followed for a period of 7-9 years. Side effects occurred in 60% and were the main reason for withdrawal in 52%. HLA typing was performed in 86; overall frequencies were comparable with those found in other studies in patients with RA. Drug induced proteinuria (5 patients) was associated with HLA-B8/DR3 (60 vs 9%), and thrombocytopenia (23 patients) with HLA-DR4 (94 vs 67%). Therapeutic effect was good in 26 (23%), and moderate in 30 (27%). No single variable, including HLA antigens, was predictive of effectiveness. It is concluded that although some of the side effects were associated with HLA antigens, HLA typing is not useful in predicting the outcome of treatment with D-penicillamine.
Chronic urticaria (CU) associated with aspirin sensitivity, termed aspirin-intolerant CU (AICU), is a common condition in the general population. The genetic mechanism of AICU still is not fully understood. We investigated genetic polymorphisms of FcepsilonR1beta and FcepsilonR1gamma in patients with CU including AICU and aspirin-tolerant CU (ATCU) by analyzing the genotypes and haplotypes of four subsets of FcepsilonR1 genes in association with various clinical parameters. Four polymorphisms of FcepsilonR1 (FcepsilonR1beta -109T>C, FcepsilonR1beta E237G, FcepsilonR1gamma -237A>G, and FcepsilonR1gamma -54G>T) were genotyped in 119 AICU patients and compared with 154 patients with ATCU and 224 normal healthy controls (NCs). No significant differences were observed with respect to the allele and genotype frequencies of all four FcepsilonR1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; p > 0.05) in CU including AICU and ATCU patients. However, two SNPs at FcepsilonR1beta E237G and FcepsilonR1gamma -237A>G were associated with atopy in AICU patients but not in ATCU. AICU patients with the AG/GG genotype of FcepsilonR1beta E237G and FcepsilonR1gamma -237G allele had a significantly higher frequency of atopy than those with the AA genotype (p = 0.02 and p = 0.040), respectively. The release of histamine from basophils induced by anti-IgE antibodies was significantly higher in AICU patients than in NCs and was increased in atopic patients compared with nonatopic patients (p = 0.006 and p = 0.007, respectively). The FcepsilonR1beta E237G and FcepsilonR1gamma -237T>G polymorphisms may be associated with the rate of atopy, which in turn could increase the release of histamine from basophils and may lead to the development of the AICU phenotype.
The development of spontaneous and haloperidol-provoked catalepsy was investigated in more than 200 mice. It was found that spontaneous and haloperidolic catalepsies have the same mechanism of development. Injections of amphetamine followed by injections of haloperidol led to persistent changes of cateleptogenic behavior in mice. Less duration of spontaneous catalepsy may reflect functional condition of catecholaminergic brain systems similar to that of patients with psychotic disorder.
