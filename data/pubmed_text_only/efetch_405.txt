An evaluation of the in vivo antigenotoxic potential of beer components on heterocyclic amines including 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4.3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) was determined with particular focus on the target organs of tumorigenesis, and the protective mechanisms involved were investigated. Beer-solution, consisting of a freeze-dried and dissolved sample, given as drinking water, reduced the formation of MeIQx-DNA adducts in mouse liver and lungs. Beer-solution added in the diet as a mimic of food additives also significantly reduced the amount of DNA adducts present in the liver, lung, and kidney DNA of mice fed with MeIQx compared to control mice fed with MeIQx in the absence of beer-solution. The amount of adducts present in the liver of mice with single or continuous administration of Trp-P-2 was significantly reduced when beer-solution was given as part of the diet compared to control mice given Trp-P-2 without beer-solution. Protective effects were observed both with lager- and stout-type samples. In an effort to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the observed protective effects, the effects of beer-solution on metabolizing enzymes for heterocyclic amines were examined. Beer-solutions inhibited the metabolic activation of Trp-P-2 to Trp-P-2(NHOH), as demonstrated by HPLC analysis. Considering the overall suppression of the genotoxicity of MeIQx and Trp-P-2 by beer, we have shown that beer components can inhibit the metabolic activation of heterocyclic amines and subsequently suppress the observed genotoxicity. The results of this study show that beer components are protective against the genotoxic effects of heterocyclic amines on target organs associated with tumorigenesis in vivo.
Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) are implicated in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Therefore, we asked if AGEs-induced ERK protein phosphorylation and mitogenesis are dependent on the receptor for AGEs (RAGE)-ROS-EGFR pathway in normal rat kidney interstitial fibroblast (NRK-49F) cells. We found that AGEs (100 microg/ml) activated EGFR and ERK1/2, which was attenuated by RAGE short-hairpin RNA (shRNA). AGEs also increased RAGE protein and intracellular ROS levels while RAGE shRNA and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuated AGEs-induced intracellular ROS. Hydrogen peroxide (5-25 microM) increased RAGE protein level while activating both EGFR and ERK1/2. Low-dose hydrogen peroxide (5 microM) increased whereas high-dose hydrogen peroxide (100 microM) decreased mitogenesis at 3 days. AGEs-activated EGFR and ERK1/2 were attenuated by an anti-oxidant (NAC) and an EGFR inhibitor (Iressa). Moreover, AGEs-induced mitogenesis was attenuated by RAGE shRNA, NAC, Iressa, and an ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059). In conclusion, it was found that AGEs-induced mitogenesis is dependent on the RAGE-ROS-EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway whereas AGEs-activated ERK1/2 is dependent on the RAGE-ROS-EGFR pathway in NRK-49F cells.
Acupuncture as a therapeutic intervention has been used for the treatment of many functional disorders including substance abuse. However, there are still many unanswered question about the basic mechanism underlying acupuncture's effectiveness in the treatment of drug addiction. Repeated injection of psycostimulants or morphine can produce behavioral and neurochemical sensitization and have been used as a model for studying drug addiction. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of acupuncture on repeated morphine-induced changes in extracellular dopamine levels using in vivo microdialysis and repeated morphine-induced behavioral changes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with saline or increasing doses of morphine (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, s.c., twice daily for 3 days). Following 15 days of withdrawal, acupuncture was applied at bilateral Shenmen (HT7) points for 1 min after the systemic challenge with morphine HCl (5 mg/kg, s.c.). Results showed that acupuncture at the specific acupoint HT7, but not at control points (TE8 and tail) significantly decreased both dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and behavioral hyperactivity induced by a systemic morphine challenge. These results suggest that the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on morphine addiction occurs through inhibition of neurochemical and behavioral sensitization to morphine.
Nickel compounds have been found to be carcinogenic based upon epidemiological, animal and cell culture studies. Previous studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in Nickel-induced carcinogenesis such as DNA methylation and histone modification. In this study, we investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in nickel-induced carcinogenesis. The expression of several miRNAs which may function as tumor suppressor genes revealed a strong downregulation of miR-203 in Ni3S2-transformed 16HBE cells (NSTCs). Meanwhile, we observed hypermethylation of CpGs in miR-203 promoter and first exon area, and proved that the hyper-methylated miR-203 was involved in the Nickel-induced tumorigenesis. Moreover, we identified that miR-203 may suppress the tumorigenesis at least in part through negatively regulating its target gene ABL1. Our findings indicate that DNA methylation-associated silencing of tumor suppressor miRNAs contributes to the development of Nickel-induced cancer.
Serotonin transporter (5HTT) is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and the target of antidepressants. We hypothesized that 5HTT mRNA levels in peripheral leukocytes may be associated with depressive states and the therapeutic response to antidepressant treatments. Fifteen patients with major depression and age-, sex-matched control subjects were studied. 5HTT mRNA levels were determined with quantitative real-time PCR method. 5HTT mRNA levels in leukocytes were significantly higher in depressive patients at baseline (before medication) than in control subjects. 5HTT mRNA levels were decreased significantly after 8 weeks of paroxetine medication compared with those at baseline. Our investigation suggested that the increased expression of 5HTT mRNA in peripheral leukocytes may be related with the pathophysiology of depression and its reduction after treatment may reflect the adaptive change induced by the antidepressant.
Cocaine enhances dopamine-mediated neurotransmission by blocking dopamine re-uptake at axon terminals. Most dopamine-containing nerve terminals innervate medium spiny neurons in the striatum of the brain. Cocaine addiction is thought to stem, in part, from neural adaptations that act to maintain equilibrium by countering the effects of repeated drug administration. Chronic exposure to cocaine upregulates several transcription factors that alter gene expression and which could mediate such compensatory neural and behavioural changes. One such transcription factor is DeltaFosB, a protein that persists in striatum long after the end of cocaine exposure. Here we identify cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) as a downstream target gene of DeltaFosB by use of DNA array analysis of striatal material from inducible transgenic mice. Overexpression of DeltaFosB, or chronic cocaine administration, raised levels of Cdk5 messenger RNA, protein, and activity in the striatum. Moreover, injection of Cdk5 inhibitors into the striatum potentiated behavioural effects of repeated cocaine administration. Our results suggest that changes in Cdk5 levels mediated by DeltaFosB, and resulting alterations in signalling involving D1 dopamine receptors, contribute to adaptive changes in the brain related to cocaine addiction.
Luteinizing hormone (LH) is a key regulator of male fertility through its effects on testosterone secretion by Leydig cells. Transcriptional control of this is, however, currently poorly understood. Mice in which the LH receptor is knocked out (LuRKO) show reduced testicular size, reduced testosterone, elevated serum LH, and a spermatogenic arrest that can be rescued by the administration of testosterone. Using genome-wide transcription profiling of LuRKO and control testes during postnatal development and following testosterone treatment, we show that the transcriptional effects of LH insensitivity are biphasic, with an early testosterone-independent phase and a subsequent testosterone-dependent phase. Testosterone rescue re-enables the second, testosterone-dependent phase of the normal prepubertal transcription program and permits the continuation of spermatogenesis. Examination of the earliest responses to testosterone highlights six genes that respond rapidly in a dose-dependent fashion to the androgen and that are therefore candidate regulatory genes associated with the testosterone-driven progression of spermatogenesis. In addition, our transcriptional data suggest a model for the replacement of fetal-type Leydig cells by adult-type cells during testicular development in which a testosterone feedback switch is necessary for adult Leydig cell production. LH signaling affects the timing of the switch but is not a strict requirement for Leydig cell differentiation.
We present a case of acute cholestatic liver injury associated with the combination of whey protein and creatine supplements. The difficulty of diagnosing drug-induced liver injury is emphasized. The patient is a healthy, 27-year-old man who presented with painless jaundice. He had no occupational exposures to solvents, was not taking prescription medications, and did not use recreational drugs or alcohol. He was an enthusiastic weight-lifter and had been taking creatine for 8 to 9 months and whey protein supplements for 4 weeks prior to the development of symptoms. Laboratory tests revealed elevated total bilirubin (54.7 mg/dL) and alkaline phosphatase (436 U/L), minimally elevated transaminases, and a creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL. Serologic work-up was negative for viral hepatitis and autoimmune liver disease, and Wilson's disease was ruled out. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram was unremarkable, but a liver biopsy showed marked cholestasis with ductular proliferation. He had dramatic clinical improvement with intravenous fluids and discontinuation of the nutritional supplements. In patients with acute liver injury, clinicians should inquire about dietary supplement usage and consider immediate discontinuation of all unnecessary products. We describe a case of profound jaundice related to a commonly used and reportedly safe combination of such supplements.
Previously, it has been found that repeated oral administration of activated charcoal (AC) to rats with renal failure markedly decreased the sensitivity of the CNS to the neurotoxic-convulsant effect of theophylline. The present study was designed to investigate whether this effect also occurs in normal rats. Normal rats received AC per os in either a single dose or in six doses every 8 h. Control animals received equal volumes of water. Two hours following the last AC dose, animals were infused IV with theophylline until the onset of maximal seizures. Although rats pretreated with repeated administrations of activated charcoal required a larger total theophylline dose to induce convulsions, the theophylline concentrations in the serum and brain at the onset of the neurotoxic episode were not affected by the charcoal pretreatment. It is, therefore, concluded that the gastrointestinal dialysis produced by the activated charcoal had no apparent effect on theophylline-induced neurotoxicity in normal rats.
To elucidate the role of metal-related molecules in hepatocarcinogenesis, we examined immunolocalization of transferrin receptor (Tfrc), ceruloplasmin (Cp) and metallothionein (MT)-1/2 in relation to liver cell foci positive for glutathione-S-transferase placental form (GST-P) in the early stage of tumor promotion by fenbendazole (FB), phenobarbital, piperonyl butoxide or thioacetamide in a rat two-stage hepatocarcinogenesis model. To estimate the involvement of oxidative stress responses to the promotion, immunolocalization of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, malondialdehyde and acrolein was similarly examined. Our findings showed that MT-1/2 immunoreactivity was not associated with the cellular distribution of GST-P and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, suggesting no role of MT-1/2 in hepatocarcinogenesis. We also found enhanced expression of Tfrc after treatment with strong tumor-promoting chemicals. With regard to Cp, the population showing down-regulation was increased in the GST-P-positive foci in relation to tumor promotion. Up-regulation of Tfrc and down-regulation of Cp was maintained in GST-P-positive neoplastic lesions induced after long-term promotion with FB, suggesting the expression changes occurring downstream of the signaling pathway involved in the formation of GST-P-positive lesions. Furthermore, enhanced accumulation of lipid peroxidation end products was observed in the GST-P-positive foci by promotion. Post-initiation treatment with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonists did not enhance any such distribution changes in GST-P-negative foci. The results thus suggest that facilitation of lipid peroxidation is involved in the induction of GST-P-positive lesions by tumor promotion from an early stage, and up-regulation of Tfrc and down-regulation of Cp may be a signature of enhanced oxidative cellular stress in these lesions.
The authors report a new Ketoconazole-induced hepatitis in which clinical, chemical and histological features show evidence of a cholestatic injury in a 62 yrs-old female recovering once therapy is stopped. In this case-report, delay of onset of the illness is very short for a 200 mg-a-day prescription and no feature leads towards an immune response. This, may be, means that Ketoconazole-induced hepatitis should be led by an idiosyncrasic mechanism. Even if fatal hepatitis are rare, prescriptors have to beware of this therapy.
In a recent genome-wide association study of generalized vitiligo, we identified ten confirmed susceptibility loci. By testing additional loci that showed suggestive association in the genome-wide study, using two replication cohorts of European descent, we observed replicated association of generalized vitiligo with variants at 3p13 encompassing FOXP1 (rs17008723, combined P=1.04x10(-8)) and with variants at 6q27 encompassing CCR6 (rs6902119, combined P=3.94x10(-7)).
To elucidate the pathophysiology of elevated blood pressure in hypercalcemic patients, we studied the plasma concentration of catecholamines and their major metabolites (as an index of sympathetic function) and the blood pressure response to norepinephrine infusion (vascular reactivity) in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, in patients with primary hypertension, and in normal controls. In addition, we evaluated the hemodynamic response to calcium infusion in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Plasma levels of both norepinephrine and epinephrine and the metabolites normetanephrine and dihydroxyphenyl-glycol were significantly higher in the hypercalcemic group than in the other two groups. Norepinephrine infusion increased blood pressure by 8.5 +/- 1.4 mm Hg in the control group, by 19 +/- 2 mm Hg in the hypercalcemic group and by 29 +/- 3 mm Hg in the primary hypertensive group. Infusion of calcium produced a significant rise in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures and in peripheral resistance in the hypertensives, whereas in the normotensive group only systolic blood pressure increased, associated with a rise in cardiac output. We conclude that the observed increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system in hypercalcemia could account for the elevation in blood pressure and the enhanced vascular reactivity could explain the hypertension in some patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.
The purpose of the present study was to develop a controllable experimental model in the dog that would consistently and predictably produce a malignant hypertensive crisis, and to determine the sequential changes in renal function, salt and water balance, and hormones that are involved in the transition from benign to accelerated hypertension. Norepinephrine (NE) was infused continuously into the renal artery of unilaterally nephrectomized dogs that were maintained on 50 mEq sodium/day. The infusion rate of NE was increased each day according to the following schedule: 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 microgram/kg/min. During the first 4 to 5 days of intrarenal NE infusion, there was a progressive decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and increases in plasma renin activity (PRA), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and filtration fraction. At the end of this period of benign hypertension, MAP had risen from a control value of 91 +/- 4 to 132 +/- 8 mm Hg, in association with approximately a 10-fold increase in PRA and a 40% reduction in renal function. Then, suddenly, during the subsequent 24-hour infusion period, the MAP increased abruptly in all animals (MAP = 156 +/- 8 mm Hg), and a hypertensive crisis occurred. This crisis was associated with the following: salt and water depletion, hyponatremia, hypovolemia and hemoconcentration, polydipsia, marked activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increased plasma cortisol concentration, hemolysis, marked impairment in renal function, lethargy, and vomiting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Nifedipine reduces blood pressure predominantly by reducing systemic vascular resistance due to a direct vasodilating action on the arterioles. This peripheral vasodilation appears greater the more severe the hypertension. Studies have demonstrated an additive effect of beta blockers and converting-enzyme inhibitors in patients not controlled with nifedipine alone. Although there is a controversy about whether diuretics have an additive effect on blood pressure in patients already taking nifedipine, it would appear that the blood pressure-lowering effect of thiazide is blunted. Studies have shown that a high sodium intake may enhance the acute blood pressure-lowering effect of nifedipine. Nifedipine does cause a long-term reduction in sodium balance.
The role of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmitter system in relation to psychoses is not completely understood, but represent a challenge in neurobiological research. The psychotic states induced by NMDA antagonists such as phencyclidine and ketamine have been described as being most similar to schizophrenia and the NMDA system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Binocular depth inversion, an illusion of visual perception, has been shown to be impaired in psychotic and psychotomimetic states in healthy and schizophrenic subjects. In this study, pictures of natural and artificial objects were presented stereoscopically to 12 healthy male volunteers and depth perception assessed using an operationalized method. The effects of the psychotomimetic S-enantiomer of the anaesthetic ketamine in two different subanaesthetic doses were compared with those of a placebo. In spite of dose dependence and grave subjective and significant objective psychopathology, no significant impairment of binocular depth perception was found with (S)-ketamine. Implications related to memory function, perceptogenesis and 'bottom-up' processing in ketamine model psychosis and schizophrenia are discussed.
Malaria is a complex disease that varies widely in epidemiology and clinical manifestation in the southeastern part of Turkey. In many regions of the world, chloroquine (CQ) has been the standard treatment for Plasmodium vivax. However, the resistance of the Plasmodium species to antimalarial drugs has become an increasing problem and a concern worldwide. Our target was to determine the Plasmodium species in the southeast region of Turkey and the therapeutic efficacy of CQ used in the treatment of malaria. Blood samples were collected from 180 patients infected with malaria before and after CQ treatment and were subjected to DNA isolation. The isolated DNA was amplified by a seminested multiplex polymerase chain reaction (SnM-PCR) including primers selected on Plasmodium small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) genes for identification of the malaria species. The SnM-PCR results showed that only P. vivax exists in this province. It was also determined that there is a therapeutic failure to CQ in 9.5% of patients. These were the second report on identification of P. vivax and the third report on determination of the therapeutic failure in patients who used CQ to cure human malaria in the southeastern region of Turkey. Our results demonstrate that the SnM-PCR is a sensitive, specific, and a rapid tool for the differentiation of malaria species.
This study examined whether sucrose-rich diet (SRD)-induced hyperglycaemia, dyslipidemia and oxidative stress may be inhibited by N-acetylcysteine (C(5)H(9)-NO(3)S), an organosulfur from Allium plants. Male Wistar 40 rats were divided into four groups (n=10): (C) given standard chow and water; (N) receiving standard chow and 2 mg/l N-acetylcysteine in its drinking water; (SRD) given standard chow and 30% sucrose in its drinking water; and (SRD-N) receiving standard chow, 30% sucrose and N-acetylcysteine in its drinking water. After 30 days of treatment, SRD rats had obesity with increased abdominal circumference, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidemia and hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation. These adverse effects were associated with oxidative stress and depressed lipid degradation in hepatic tissue. The SRD adverse effects were not observed in SDR-N rats. N-Acetylcysteine reduced the oxidative stress, enhancing glutathione-peroxidase activity, and normalizing lipid hydroperoxyde, reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase in hepatic tissue of SRD-N rats. The beta-hydroxyacyl coenzyme-A dehydrogenase and citrate-synthase activities were increased in SRD-N rats, indicating enhanced lipid degradation in hepatic tissue as compared to SRD. SRD-N rats had reduced serum oxidative stress and diminished glucose, triacylglycerol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio in relation to SRD. In conclusion, NAC offers promising therapeutic values in prevention of dyslipidemic profile and alleviation of hyperglycaemia in high-sucrose intake condition by improving antioxidant defences. N-Acetylcysteine had also effects preventing metabolic shifting in hepatic tissue, thus enhancing fat degradation and reducing body weight gain in conditions of excess sucrose intake. The application of this agent in food system via exogenous addition may be feasible and beneficial for antioxidant protection.
The comparative potency of two beta-blockers, propranolol and atenolol, in the inhibition of exercise tachycardia and isoproterenol-tachycardia has been studied in two groups of hypertensive patients, using oral doses which were increased weekly. A linear correlation was observed between the reduction in exercise tachycardia and the dose of each drug, up to a daily dose of propranolol 480 mg and atenolol 600 mg. Propranolol was slightly (0.7/1) more potent in decreasing maximal exercise tachycardia than atenolol when tested in low doses (below 100 mg); at higher doses (480 mg) no differences were found. However, atenolol was 10 times less potent than propranolol in blocking isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, which seems to be related to the cardioselectivity of atenolol.
Amphotericin B is a widely used broad-spectrum antifungal agent, despite being associated with significant adverse events, including nephrotoxicity.
The present prospective study collected data on outcomes for 418 adult patients treated consecutively with polyenes in hematology and oncology wards in 20 hospitals in Europe.
Patients initially received amphotericin B deoxycholate (62% of patients), liposomal amphotericin B (27%), or other lipid formulations of amphotericin B (11%). Of the patients initially treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate, 36% had therapy switched to lipid formulations of amphotericin B, primarily because of increased serum creatinine levels (in 45.7% of patients) or other amphotericin B-attributable adverse events (in 41.3% of patients). Nephrotoxicity, which was defined as a > or = 50% increase in the serum creatinine level, developed in 57% of patients with normal kidney function at baseline. Predictors of nephrotoxicity included formulation type and duration of treatment. Compared with patients without nephrotoxicity, patients with nephrotoxicity had a higher mortality rate (24%), and their mean length of stay in the hospital was prolonged by 8.6 days. Slight increases in the serum creatinine level (i.e., > or = 50%) were associated with a significantly longer stay in the hospital. Severe nephrotoxicity (i.e., a > or = 200% increase in the serum creatinine level) was a significant predictor of death, as were severe underlying medical conditions and documented fungal infection.
This prospective study confirmed that, in European hospitals, amphotericin B formulations have a major influence on the length of stay in the hospital and nephrotoxicity-associated mortality.
The effect of lithium administered for six months on simulated car driving and other psychological tests was studied in patients with Menière's disease. The dose of lithium was adjusted every two weeks to maintain the serum level between 0.7 and 1.0 mmol/1. The trial was double-blind and cross-over in type, the effect of lithium being compared with a placebo. The subjects were within the normal range of Beck's depression scale and Marke-Nyman's temperament scale. Lithium was found neither to influence the simulated driving nor to affect the scores in the two rating scales. The only specific complaints observed during lithium treatment were tremor and increased thirst.
Delirium in 3 elderly patients with recent cerebral infarction and pre-existing brain dysfunction receiving low dose propranolol is described. The dose ranged from 30 to 60 mg/day and the interval between delirium onset and drug initiation was 3-7 days. One patient exhibited ictal mydriasis and sinus tachycardia. Hypoalbuminemia was found in 1 patient. Discontinuation of propranolol abolished their delirious pictures 2-5 days later. Their delirium may be attributed to central beta blockade or anticholinergic effect. Preexisting brain damage, old age and hypoalbuminemia may predispose such patients to neuropharmacotoxicity of low dose propranolol.
Mutations in the PTEN gene are associated with a broad spectrum of disorders, including Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and Lhermitte-Duclos disease. In addition, PTEN mutations have been described in a few patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and macrocephaly. In this study, we screened the PTEN gene for mutations and deletions in 88 patients with ASDs and macrocephaly (defined as >or=2 SD above the mean). Mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing of all exons and flanking regions, as well as the promoter region. Dosage analysis of PTEN was carried out using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). No partial or whole gene deletions were observed. We identified a de novo missense mutation (D326N) in a highly conserved amino acid in a 5-year-old boy with autism, mental retardation, language delay, extreme macrocephaly (+9.6 SD) and polydactyly of both feet. Polydactyly has previously been described in two patients with Lhermitte-Duclos disease and CS and is thus likely to be a rare sign of PTEN mutations. Our findings suggest that PTEN mutations are a relatively infrequent cause of ASDs with macrocephaly. Screening of PTEN mutations is warranted in patients with autism and pronounced macrocephaly, even in the absence of other features of PTEN-related tumor syndromes.
The objective of this study was to determine if 1,3-butanediol would reduce a neurologic deficit in rats exposed to ischemic-hypoxia (Levine rats). Age and weight matched male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 2% halothane. The right common carotid and external jugular vein were ligated and cannulated and EEG screws were implanted followed by a 2 hour recovery period. Thirty minutes prior to exposure the rats received either 1,3-butanediol (47 mmole/kg i.v.; n = 11) or an equal volume of saline (n = 10). The rats were then exposed to 4.5% O2 until mean arterial blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg. The oxygen level was then increased to 8% for 30 minutes, after which the rats were returned to room air. Posture, hemiparesis, circling, shuffling, activity, and ability to hang on to a vertical screen were scored 1 (normal) to 5 (severe deficit) at 2 and 20 hours after insult. The time to 70 mm Hg was extended from 7.9 +/- 0.9 min for saline treated rats to 19.0 +/- 2.3 min for the 1,3-butanediol treated rats (p less than 0.001). All eleven 1,3-butanediol treated rats survived the hypoxic insult; 90% (9/10) saline treated rats died. In an attempt to reduce the insult, six additional saline treated rats were switched to 8% O2 at 75 mm Hg and still 4/6 died. The mean score at 20 hours for three surviving saline treated rats was 3.4. A significantly better (p less than 0.002) mean 20 hour score for the surviving 8/11 1,3-butanediol treated rats was 1.2. 1,3-butanediol increases survival and decreases the neurologic deficits associated with this ischemic-hypoxic insult.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used therapeutic agents, however, they are associated with a high prevalence of intestinal side effects. In this investigation, rat precision cut intestinal slices (PCIS) were evaluated as an ex vivo model to study NSAID-induced intestinal toxicity. Firstly, PCIS were incubated with 0-200 μM diclofenac (DCF), one of the most intensively studied NSAIDs, to investigate whether they could correctly reflect the toxic mechanisms. DCF induced intestinal toxicity in PCIS was shown by morphological damage and ATP depletion. DCF induced endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial injury and oxidative stress were reflected by up-regulated HSP-70 (heat shock protein 70) and BiP (binding immunoglobulin protein) gene expression, caspase 9 activation, GSH (glutathione) depletion and HO-1 (heme oxygenase 1) gene up-regulation respectively. Furthermore, DCF intestinal metabolites, which gave rise to protein adduct but not toxicity, were detected in PCIS. Secondly, PCIS were incubated with various concentrations of five NSAIDs. Typical NSAID-induced morphological changes were observed in PCIS. The ex vivo toxicity ranking (diflunisal> diclofenac = indomethacin > naproxen ≫ aspirin) showed good correlation with published in vitro and in vivo data, with diflunisal being the only exception. In conclusion, PCIS correctly reflect the various mechanisms of DCF-induced intestinal toxicity, and can serve as an ex vivo model for the prediction of NSAID-induced intestinal toxicity.
