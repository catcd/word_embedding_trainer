To investigate the effects of the heme oxygenase (HO)-1/carbon monoxide system on iron deposition and portal pressure in rats with hepatic fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL).
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into a Sham group, BDL group, Fe group, deferoxamine (DFX) group, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) group and cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) group. The levels of HO-1 were detected using different methods. The serum carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), iron, and portal vein pressure (PVP) were also quantified. The plasma and mRNA levels of hepcidin were measured. Hepatic fibrosis and its main pathway were assessed using Van Gieson's stain, hydroxyproline, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1).
Serum COHb and protein and mRNA expression levels of HO-1 and Nrf2 were increased in the BDL group compared with the Sham group and were much higher in the CoPP group. The ZnPP group showed lower expression of HO-1 and Nrf2 and lower COHb. The levels of iron and PVP were enhanced in the BDL group but were lower in the ZnPP and DFX groups and were higher in the CoPP and Fe groups. Hepcidin levels were higher, whereas superoxide dismutase levels were increased and malonaldehyde levels were decreased in the ZnPP and DFX groups. The ZnPP group also showed inhibited TGF-β1 expression and regulated TIMP-1/MMP-2 expression, as well as obviously attenuated liver fibrosis.
Reducing hepatic iron deposition and CO levels by inhibiting HO-1 activity though the Nrf2/Keap pathway could be helpful in improving hepatic fibrosis and regulating PVP.
Extracranial spread of neuroectodermal tumors is an unusual event, most frequently expected from glioblastomas and medulloblastomas. Single cases of metastatic oligodendrogliomas have been described, but no genetic data are reported. Oligodendrogliomas are characterized by distinct genetic alterations, i.e. loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 1p and 19q; therefore, molecular genetic analysis of metastatic cases is of considerable interest. It may be instrumental in defining the distant tumor as metastatic oligodendroglioma and give clues to the genetic events associated with the highly malignant transformation. We present the case of a patient with multiple bone metastases from a cerebral oligodendroglioma. Oligodendroglioma grade II was the diagnosis both at original and second operation, performed 7 and 1 years before the extracranial dissemination. The extraneural spread presented before the local intracranial recurrence. The patient received procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine chemotherapy and radiotherapy after the second surgery. The computed tomography-guided biopsy of the bone lesions revealed tumor cells positive for GFAP, S-100 and Leu-7 and negative for cytokeratin, LCA and EMA. The genetic analysis of DNA from the original tumor, the bone metastasis and the autoptic brain tumor showed LOH of 1p; heterozygous deletion of CDKN2A/p 16 was detected as additional alteration in the metastasis and in the intracranial tumor at autopsy. TP53, MDM2 and CDKN2A/p14ARF genes were unchanged. Repeated brain surgery and extended survival may have acted as promoter of extraneural dissemination. Loss of CDKN2A most probably played an important role in the malignant progression: its involvement in metastatic potential remains to be clarified. Our data confirm that malignant transformation of oliogodendrogliomas may be undetected by histology and underscore the importance of genetic analysis. Coincidentally with intensive anticancer therapy, chemotherapy included, employed in patients with oligodendroglioma and the ensuing long survival, the frequency of metastatic oliogodendrogliomas may increase.
In chronic heart failure mechanisms which regulate myocardial contractility are defective (Frank-Starling mechanism, force-frequency-relationship, beta-adrenergic responsiveness). Neuroendocrine mechanisms induce the progression of left ventricular dysfunction to chronic heart failure (renin-angiontensin-aldosterone system, endothelin system, sympathetic nervous system). Angiotensin II and norepinephrine induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in myocardial cells, thereby contributing to the progression of left ventricular function to heart failure.
Established principles for treatment are based on the antagonism of these neuroendocrine mechanisms. New concepts like augmentation of myocardial regeneration by stem cells are an attractive perspective for innovative treatments of heart failure. The characterization of the underlying mechanisms can offer potential new strategies of the treatment of these malignant condition.
Heat shock proteins (HSP) are a subset of the molecular chaperones, best known for their rapid and abundant induction by stress. HSP genes are activated at the transcriptional level by heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). During the progression of many types of cancer, this heat shock transcriptional regulon becomes co-opted by mechanisms that are currently unclear, although evidently triggered in the emerging tumor cell. Concerted activation of HSF1 and the accumulation of HSPs then participate in many of the traits that permit the malignant phenotype. Thus, cancers of many histologies exhibit activated HSF1 and increased HSP levels that may help to deter tumor suppression and evade therapy in the clinic. We review here the extensive work that has been carried out and is still in progress aimed at (1) understanding the oncogenic mechanisms by which HSP genes are switched on, (2) determining the roles of HSF1/HSP in malignant transformation and (3) discovering approaches to therapy based on disrupting the influence of the HSF1-controlled transcriptome in cancer.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy. Here, we performed high-resolution copy-number analysis on 125 HCC tumors and whole-exome sequencing on 24 of these tumors. We identified 135 homozygous deletions and 994 somatic mutations of genes with predicted functional consequences. We found new recurrent alterations in four genes (ARID1A, RPS6KA3, NFE2L2 and IRF2) not previously described in HCC. Functional analyses showed tumor suppressor properties for IRF2, whose inactivation, exclusively found in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related tumors, led to impaired TP53 function. In contrast, inactivation of chromatin remodelers was frequent and predominant in alcohol-related tumors. Moreover, association of mutations in specific genes (RPS6KA3-AXIN1 and NFE2L2-CTNNB1) suggested that Wnt/β-catenin signaling might cooperate in liver carcinogenesis with both oxidative stress metabolism and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. This study provides insight into the somatic mutational landscape in HCC and identifies interactions between mutations in oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations related to specific risk factors.
The alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist varenicline has greater efficacy than other pharmacotherapeutic aids for smoking cessation. This presents an opportunity to evaluate the predictive validity of rat models of nicotine taking and relapse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of varenicline to attenuate nicotine self-administration and relapse, as modelled by the reinstatement model of nicotine relapse in rats.
Rats were trained to respond for intravenous nicotine under a fixed ratio schedule of reinforcement. The effects of varenicline (0.3-3.0 mg/kg s.c.) on both nicotine and food self-administration and reinstatement of nicotine seeking were evaluated.
Varenicline dose-dependently reduced nicotine self-administration and attenuated both nicotine prime and combined nicotine prime plus nicotine-paired cue-induced reinstatement. Varenicline had no effect on cue-induced reinstatement in the absence of a nicotine prime nor did it induce reinstatement when given alone.
The effects of varenicline on nicotine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking are consistent with the demonstrated clinical efficacy of varenicline for smoking cessation.
Hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome (HMPS) is characterized by apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of multiple types of colorectal polyp, with colorectal carcinoma occurring in a high proportion of affected individuals. Here, we use genetic mapping, copy-number analysis, exclusion of mutations by high-throughput sequencing, gene expression analysis and functional assays to show that HMPS is caused by a duplication spanning the 3' end of the SCG5 gene and a region upstream of the GREM1 locus. This unusual mutation is associated with increased allele-specific GREM1 expression. Whereas GREM1 is expressed in intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts in controls, GREM1 is predominantly expressed in the epithelium of the large bowel in individuals with HMPS. The HMPS duplication contains predicted enhancer elements; some of these interact with the GREM1 promoter and can drive gene expression in vitro. Increased GREM1 expression is predicted to cause reduced bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway activity, a mechanism that also underlies tumorigenesis in juvenile polyposis of the large bowel.
Hypotension is the most frequent adverse event reported with intravenous amiodarone (Cordarone IV). The hypotension has been attributed to the vasoactive solvents of the formulation, polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol, both known to exhibit negative inotropy and hypotensive effect. A new aqueous formulation of intravenous amiodarone (Amio-Aqueous) does not contain vasoactive excipients and may be less toxic and cause less hypotension than Cordarone IV. This hypothesis was tested in a series of animal studies with direct comparison of Amio-Aqueous and Cordarone IV. All studies were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats. The acute toxicology study showed that both LD50 and LD100 were 30% greater for Amio-Aqueous than for Cordarone. At the dose at which all animals expired on Cordarone, 50% of animals were still alive on Amio-Aqueous. The study on myocardial contractility showed that Amio-Aqueous was a far less negative inotropic than Cordarone IV (P < 0.001). Amio Aqueous did not have an effect on contractility at 5- and 10-mg/kg dose levels while Cordarone resulted in a 25% (P < 0.01) and 29% (P < 0.002) decrease, respectively. The study on arterial blood pressure showed that Cordarone caused a significant decrease in blood pressure at each of the 3, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg doses (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) while Amio-Aqueous did not. The study on the antiarrhythmic effects showed comparable efficacy for both formulations. In conclusion, Cordarone IV was more toxic and caused significant hypotension and negative inotropy while Amio-Aqueous lacked the hypotensive and cardiotoxic properties of Cordarone. Therefore, Amio-Aqueous is a safer alternative than the standard formulation.
The mechanism of the vasodilatory action of carvedilol (BM 14190), a new antihypertensive agent, was investigated in normal volunteers. Intra-arterial blood pressure and ECG were monitored continuously. Carvedilol (1 mg/min for 15 minutes) produced a rapid reduction in blood pressure and a transient increase in heart rate. At the end of infusion, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 23% (-32.3 mm Hg) and 18% (-13.6 mm Hg), respectively, whereas heart rate was not different from baseline. At the doses used, the hypotensive effect of carvedilol was greater than that of labetalol (36 and 72 mg in 15 minutes). Carvedilol and labetalol antagonized isoproterenol-induced hypotension and tachycardia, at serum levels greater than or equal to 8 and 20 mg/ml, respectively. Both drugs antagonized phenylephrine pressor effects. A similar degree of inhibition (25% of control) of pressor effects was observed for carvedilol and labetalol when their respective serum concentrations were 23 ng/ml and 80 ng/ml. Neither carvedilol nor labetalol had any effect on AII pressor responses. Carvedilol serum levels as high as 150 ng/ml failed to inhibit AII-induced pressor responses. Our results suggest that at the doses used in this study, carvedilol has both alpha 1-and nonselective beta-receptor blocking properties. Moreover, carvedilol is approximately three to five times more potent than labetalol in blocking alpha 1-and beta-receptors and in reducing blood pressure.
In order to examine how the distinction between implicit and explicit memory might relate to theories regarding the organization of memory, two types of memory tests were administered in conjunction with the amnesia-inducing benzodiazepine midazolam. Performance on an implicit task (perceptual facilitation in identifying degraded pictures and words) was relatively unimpaired by midazolam, whereas performance on an explicit task (recognition memory) was severely impaired. Interpreting the results in both the implicit/explicit framework and an independent stage analysis suggests that the terms implicit and explicit may reflect something about the nature of the memory representation and need not be reserved solely to describe classes of memory tasks.
Acute carpal tunnel syndrome is well recognized in patients with haemophilia and conservative management with factor replacement and temporary splinting is recommended. There have, however, been very few reported cases of acute carpal tunnel syndrome as a complication of oral anticoagulant therapy. We describe such a case in a patient on long-term warfarin anticoagulation, drawing attention to particular features of the history and clinical findings. In contrast to previous reports, we recommend prompt decompression under local anaesthesia and continuation of the anticoagulant therapy.
We previously reported a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identifying 14 susceptibility loci for generalized vitiligo. We report here a second GWAS (450 individuals with vitiligo (cases) and 3,182 controls), an independent replication study (1,440 cases and 1,316 controls) and a meta-analysis (3,187 cases and 6,723 controls) identifying 13 additional vitiligo-associated loci. These include OCA2-HERC2 (combined P = 3.80 × 10(-8)), MC1R (P = 1.82 × 10(-13)), a region near TYR (P = 1.57 × 10(-13)), IFIH1 (P = 4.91 × 10(-15)), CD80 (P = 3.78 × 10(-10)), CLNK (P = 1.56 × 10(-8)), BACH2 (P = 2.53 × 10(-8)), SLA (P = 1.58 × 10(-8)), CASP7 (P = 3.56 × 10(-8)), CD44 (P = 1.78 × 10(-9)), IKZF4 (P = 2.75 × 10(-14)), SH2B3 (P = 3.54 × 10(-18)) and TOB2 (P = 6.81 × 10(-10)). Most vitiligo susceptibility loci encode immunoregulatory proteins or melanocyte components that likely mediate immune targeting and the relationships among vitiligo, melanoma, and eye, skin and hair coloration.
To determine if defects in the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) system can cause hypertension, mice were generated with a disruption of the proANP gene. Homozygous mutants had no circulating or atrial ANP, and their blood pressures were elevated by 8 to 23 millimeters of mercury when they were fed standard (0.5 percent sodium chloride) and intermediate (2 percent sodium chloride) salt diets. On standard salt diets, heterozygotes had normal amounts of circulating ANP and normal blood pressures. However, on high (8 percent sodium chloride) salt diets they were hypertensive, with blood pressures elevated by 27 millimeters of mercury. These results demonstrate that genetically reduced production of ANP can lead to salt-sensitive hypertension.
To examine the clinical usefulness of selective and non-selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, we compared a selective (tamsulosin) and non-selective (terazosin) alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of Chinese patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The study was a single-blind, randomized, multicenter design to compare a fixed dose of tamsulosin (0.2 mg) or terazosin (2 mg) given once daily after breakfast for four weeks. A total of 212 patients were enrolled with 201 patients included in the analysis. The primary variables assessed were changes in total International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), and average urinary flow rate (AFR) four weeks after dosing. Adverse events were recorded through the treatment period. Both tamsulosin and terazosin produced significant improvements in total IPSS (total score of 11.8 +/- 4.5; decrease in 45.1% and total score of 13.3 +/- 5.3; decrease in 39.0%, respectively) (p < 0.001), Qmax (13.2 +/- 4.1 mL/s, 37.5% increase and 13.6 +/- 3.6 mL/s, 30.8% increase, respectively) (p < 0.001) and AFR (7.7 +/- 3.3 mL/s, 37.5% increase and 7.8 +/- 3.1 mL/s, 25.8% increase, respectively) (p < 0.001) at endpoint. Tamsulosin was superior to terazosin in improvement of total IPSS (p < 0.05) and AFR (p < 0.05). The incidence of adverse events by administration of tamsulosin was less than that by terazosin (13 and 50, respectively; p < 0.01). Among the adverse event, incidence of dizziness (p < 0.001) and hypotension (p < 0.01) by administration of terazosin were significantly greater than that by tamsulosin. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of sitting position decreased significantly in patients treated with terazosin (p < 0.01). These results suggest that tamsulosin, a selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist, was superior to terazosin, a non-selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, in efficacy and adverse events in patients with symptomatic BPH.
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral disorder of children and is treated by psychostimulants. Psychostimulant exposure to children at the time of neuronal development can cause behavioral and physiological changes continuing during adulthood. Most of the studies on psychostimulants investigate the acute effects of the drug. The objective of this study was to investigate whether acute or chronic exposure to methylphenidate (MPD), the drug most often used to treat ADHD in children, will modulate the diurnal activity pattern of young rats. Maintaining the diurnal activity pattern is a physiological process that regulates the internal homeostasis. Dose response protocol was used to study the effect of acute and chronic MPD in four young post natal day 40 (P 40) rat groups, (each N=8), as follows: saline (control) group, and 0.6, 2.5, or 10.0 mg/kg i.p. MPD groups, respectively. The experiment was performed over 11 consecutive days of continuous locomotor activity recording using the open field assay. The data evaluation was divided into four phases as follows: acute, induction, washout and expression phases. There was a dose-dependent increase in the average locomotor activity in the first few hours post-injection. Analysis of the diurnal rhythmic pattern of locomotion in the three dose groups compared to control demonstrated that only the 10.0 mg/kg MPD elicited significant changes in diurnal pattern activity in the washout and the expression phase. In addition, this study indicated that chronic MPD treatment elicits dose dependent anticipation and/or withdrawal and behavioral sensitization.
Because nitric oxide (NO) dilates vascular smooth muscle cells, a deficiency of endogenous pulmonary nitric oxide production by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Our aim was to determine whether experimentally induced CDH in rats results in a decrease in the synthesis of NO in the lungs. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were fed 300 mg/kg of nitrofen at 10.5 days' gestation. CDH, control, and sham (dosed with nitrofen, but without CDH) lungs were homogenized at full term (22 days' gestation) for measurement of NOS activity using the 14C-L-arginine to 14C-L-citrulline conversion assay. Western blot analysis with anti-endothelial cell NOS (EC-NOS) monoclonal antibody (mAb) was performed, and NOS expression was measured by densitometry. NOS activity was highest in the pulmonary parenchyma of control rat lungs (0.420 +/- 0.20 fmol/min/mg lung; n = 11), intermediate in sham lungs (0.370 +/- 0.010 fmol/min/mg lung; n = 14), and lowest in CDH lungs (0.300 +/- 0.04 fmol/min/mg lung; n = 12). NOS activity in the CDH and sham lungs was significantly lower than that of control lungs (P < .05). There was no difference in pulmonary NOS activity between sham and CDH lungs. NOS protein expression by Western blot analysis paralleled the observation for NOS activity in all groups, with the highest concentrations in controls, intermediate expression in sham lungs, and lowest expression in CDH lungs. Both NOS expression and NOS activity are significantly decreased in CDH rat lungs. Pulmonary hypertension in this model may be attributable to a deficiency of endogenous NO. This is the first reported study to suggest that decreased NOS activity may result in pulmonary hypertension in CDH.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) is an important enzyme for cholinergic nerve transmission. The action of toxic organophosphates such as nerve agents is based on AChE inhibition. The death following acute nerve agent poisoning is due to central or peripheral respiratory/cardiac failure. Therefore, the changes in AChE activity following nerve agents acting predominantly on the central (sarin, soman) or peripheral (VX) level were studied. It is known that AChE activity in different structures exists in relative excess. Female Wistar rats intoxicated with sarin, soman, and VX in different doses (0.5-2.0 x LD(50)) were divided into groups of survived and died animals. AChE activities in diaphragm, brain parts (pontomedullar area, frontal cortex, basal ganglia, in some cases other parts of the brain) were determined and the rest of activity (in %) was correlated with survival/death of animals. More precise elucidation of action of nerve agents and the assessment of minimal AChE activity in different organs compatible with the survival of organism poisoned with nerve agents were the aims of this study.
Although amitriptyline has gained attention as a potent local anesthetic, recent animal studies showed that it can cause irreversible neural impairment. We hypothesized that nerve membrane disruption caused by solubilization, a common detergent property, accounted for amitriptyline neurotoxicity. We used a two-phase approach to test our hypothesis. Firstly, we determined (1) the molecular aggregation concentration of amitriptyline, (2) the concentration of amitriptyline that disrupts artificial lipid membranes and (3) the concentration of amitriptyline that causes hemolysis. Secondly, we compared these levels with neurotoxic concentrations determined from assessment in a rat model of spinal anesthesia using changes in cutaneous stimulus threshold (CST). Amitriptyline concentrations that caused molecular aggregation, model membrane disruption and hemolysis were 0.46%, 0.35% and 0.3%, respectively. Animal study showed a significant increase in CST at >or=0.3% of amitriptyline, indicating neurological impairment. Since amitriptyline caused model membrane disruption and hemolysis at the molecular aggregation concentration, solubilization plays a role in the destruction of artificial membranes and erythrocytes. Furthermore, these concentrations are also in good agreement with the minimum concentration causing neurological injury. Therefore, while additional studies, including histopathology, are necessary to clarify this observation, amitriptyline neurotoxicity appears to be associated with its detergent nature.
The induction of anaesthesia with intravenous diazepam is a valuable contribution to the simpler use of cardioversion and is the method of choice because it is readily available for elective cardioversion. Fifty-six cardioversion procedures were carried out by this method in an African hospital. No special premedication or drug preparation was used. There were no hazards apart from transient apnoea in two patients and persisting amnesia in one patient.
Human drug users report that the initial positive effects of cocaine are followed by a dysphoric state characterized by anxiety and drug-craving. As a means of presumably attenuating these negative aftereffects, 50-90% of cocaine users choose to co-administer ethanol during cocaine binges. This co-administration reportedly prolongs the "high" and diminishes the "low" associated with cocaine use.
The current study was intended to assess whether this phenomenon could be modeled in the animal laboratory. We have previously shown that animals running a straight alley for an intravenous cocaine reward develop a unique approach-avoidance "conflict" behavior that is characterized by stop and retreat behaviors as the subjects approach the goal box. The retreats are thought to reflect the concurrent positive (reward) and negative (anxiety) associations with the goal box and can be dose-dependently reduced by pretreatment with diazepam, which presumably attenuates the anxiety stemming from the conflict.
To test the role of ethanol in reducing cocaine-induced anxiety, rats were trained to run a straight-arm alley for a single daily injection of cocaine (1.0 mg/kg IV).
Rats that had the opportunity to then drink either an 8% or a 4% sucrose-ethanol solution immediately following their daily runway trial came to exhibit fewer retreats than rats that did not drink ethanol following their cocaine injection.
These results suggest that ethanol effectively reduces the development of approach-avoidance conflict in animals running an alley for IV cocaine, a result that may account for the prevalence of cocaine-ethanol co-administration in humans.
We have previously demonstrated that enterally administered heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) decreases the incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in a neonatal rat model. Because apoptosis contributes to gut barrier failure in this model, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HB-EGF on apoptosis during the development of NEC.
NEC was induced in neonatal rats by exposure to hypoxia, hypothermia, hypertonic formula feeding (HHHTF) plus enteral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Fifty-one neonatal rats were randomly divided into the following groups: (1) breast-fed (BF), (2) HHHTF + LPS, and (3) HHHTF + LPS with HB-EGF (600 microg/kg) added to the formula. NEC was evaluated using a standard histological scoring system. Apoptotic cells in intestinal tissues were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and by active caspase 3 immunohistochemical staining.
The incidence of NEC in the HHHTF + LPS group was higher than that in the BF group (65% vs 0%, P < .05). With administration of HB-EGF, the incidence of NEC significantly decreased to 23.8% (P < .05). The median TUNEL and active caspase 3 scores in the HHHTF + LPS group were higher than those in the BF group (1.9 vs 0.9 and 1.75 vs 0.6, respectively, P < .05). The median TUNEL and active caspase 3 scores were significantly decreased in the HHHTF + LPS + HB-EGF group compared with the HHHTF + LPS group (1.24 vs 1.9 and 1.0 vs 1.75, respectively, P < .05).
HB-EGF reduces the incidence of NEC in a neonatal rat model in part by decreasing apoptosis. These results support the use of HB-EGF-based clinical regimens for the treatment of NEC.
Stereotactic posteroventral pallidotomy (PVP) as a treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms has been increasingly used in moderate-advanced disease. We examined the pharmacodynamic responses of PD patients to single oral levodopa doses and intravenous levodopa infusions before and after PVP surgery. Nine subjects with advanced PD received a single oral dose and ramped intravenous levodopa infusions before and 3-5 weeks after unilateral PVP. Timed motor tasks, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) evaluations, and ordinal dyskinesia rating were performed after oral levodopa and during i.v. levodopa infusions. Serum prolactin and dopa levels were measured during the levodopa infusions. Overall timed motor but not motor UPDRS scores were improved after PVP in both the worst ("off") and best ("on") states. Contralateral but not ipsilateral limb dyskinesias were substantially reduced at all serum (dopa) levels after PVP. Ipsilateral and contralateral timed motor performance at low serum (dopa) levels was improved by PVP. Walking speeds at all serum (dopa) levels were not changed by PVP. Serum prolactin was reduced equally by increasing (dopa) preoperatively and postoperatively. PVP significantly and favorably altered oral and intravenous levodopa pharmacodynamics by improving bilateral limb motor function and contralateral dyskinesia but did not alter walking speed. PVP appears to widen significantly the therapeutic window for levodopa in PD.
