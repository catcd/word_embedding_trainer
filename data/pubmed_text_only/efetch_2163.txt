We sought to establish the safety and feasibility of a clinical pathway for the outpatient initiation of antiarrhythmic medications (AAMs) for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFl). AAMs are frequently utilized to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with AF or AFl. Although they are often initiated in an outpatient setting, there is little prospective evidence for the safety of this approach. Patients with a history of AF or AFl were prospectively monitored with an event recorder during 409 AAM initiation trials. All AAMs were initiated in sinus rhythm. Patients transmitted a recording (30 seconds) once daily for 10 consecutive days. Amiodarone was used for 212 patients (51.8%), 127 (31.1%) received a type 1C AAM, 37 (9.0%) received sotalol, and 33 (8.1%) received a type 1A AAM. Adverse events occurred in 17 patients (3 died, 3 had bradycardia that required permanent pacemaker implantation, and 11 had bradycardia requiring a decrease in the dose of antiarrhythmic or rate-controlling medication). Most events were due to bradycardia in patients who received amiodarone. There was a significant association between amiodarone-associated bradycardia and women. The only event that occurred during the first 48 hours was an episode of bradycardia in a patient who received amiodarone and was managed as an outpatient. The outpatient initiation of AAMs for patients with a history of AF or AFl while in sinus rhythm is associated with significant risk. Most adverse events occurred beyond the usual time period for in-hospital monitoring of the initiation of AAMs.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether cognitive function changes over time in women with breast cancer who received adjuvant therapy as compared to women with breast cancer who received no adjuvant therapy. Three groups of women (n = 46) were studied; groups 1 and 2 consisted of women with stage I or II breast cancer. Group 1 received chemotherapy and group 2 received chemotherapy plus tamoxifen. Group 3 consisted of women with ductal carcinoma in situ who received no chemotherapy or tamoxifen. Cognitive function was evaluated at three timepoints. Time 1 occurred after surgery and before chemotherapy initiation in groups 1 and 2. Time 1 for group 3 occurred post-surgery. Time 2 occurred within 1 week after the conclusion of chemotherapy for groups 1 and 2 and at a comparable time for group 3. Time 3 occurred 1 year after Time 2. Women who received chemotherapy plus tamoxifen exhibited deterioration on measures of visual memory and verbal working memory and reported more memory complaints. Women who received chemotherapy alone also exhibited deteriorations in verbal working memory. Conversely, cognitive function scores improved in women who received no therapy, indicating practice effects. In conclusion, adjuvant chemotherapy in women with breast cancer can be associated with deteriorations in memory and this may persist over time. The addition of tamoxifen may lead to more widespread memory deficits.
Reactive oxygen species have been involved in the pathophysiology of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-nephrosis. The role of H2O2 in these rats may be studied modulating the amount or activity of catalase, which breakdowns H2O2 to water and oxygen. To explore the role of H2O2 in this experimental model, we studied the effect of the in vivo catalase inhibiton with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ) on the course of PAN-nephrosis. Four groups of rats were studied: control rats (CT group), PAN-injected rats (PAN group), ATZ-injected rats (ATZ group), and ATZ- and PAN-injected rats (ATZPAN group). Rats were placed in metabolic cages to collect 24 h urine along the study, ATZ (1 g/kg) was given 24 h before PAN injection (75 mg/kg), and the proteinuria was measured on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Proteinuria started before (day 4) and was significantly higher on days 6, 8, and 10 in the ATZPAN group than in the PAN group. On day 10, hypercholesterolemia was significantly higher in the ATZPAN group than in the PAN group. These data indicate that the in vivo catalase inhibition magnifies PAN-nephrosis, suggesting that H2O2 is produced in vivo and involved in the renal damage in this experimental disease.
The molecular basis of the axonal reorganization that follows seizure-induced brain injury is unknown. Elevations in neurotrophins following seizures suggest that growth factors may play a role in this process. After pilocarpine-induced seizures, robust axonal sprouting from dentate granule cells and cholinergic forebrain neurons was evident in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Intraventricular infusions of an NGF-specific antibody that blocks NGF biological activity in vitro attenuated the cholinergic axonal sprouting and the increases in cell body size of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that followed seizure-induced injury in vivo. In contrast to its effects on the cholinergic network, the NGF antibody did not decrease the sprouting of dentate granule cell axons into the inner molecular layer. These results suggest that NGF may have a functional and system-specific role in the remodeling of networks that follows repetitive seizures.
Arsenic (As), a ubiquitous toxic metal, is an important environmental and industrial pollutant throughout the world. Inorganic As (iAs) is usually more harmful than organic ones and with a high risk of diabetes incidence by exposure. However, the toxicological effects of iAs on growth and function of pancreatic β-cells still remain unclear. Here, we found that iAs significantly decreased insulin secretion and cell viability, and increased ROS and MDA formation in pancreatic β-cell-derived RIN-m5F cells. iAs also induced the increases in sub-G1 hypodiploids, annexin V-Cy3 binding, and caspase-3 activity in RIN-m5F cells, indicating that iAs could induce β-cell apoptosis. Moreover, iAs induced MAPKs activation, mitochondria dysfunction, p53 up-regulation, Bcl-2 and Mdm-2 down-regulation, PARP, and caspase cascades, which displayed features of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic signals. In addition, exposure of RIN-m5F cells to iAs, could trigger ER stress as indicated by the enhancement in ER stress-related molecules induction (such as GRP78, GRP94, CHOP, and XBP1), procaspase-12 cleavage, and calpain activation. The iAs-induced apoptosis and its-related signalings could be effectively reversed by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. We next observed that exposure of mice to iAs in drinking water for 6 consecutive weeks significantly decreased decreased the plasma insulin, elevated glucose intolerance and plasma lipid peroxidation, and induced islet cells apoptosis, which accompanied with arsenic accumulation in the whole blood and pancreas. N-acetylcysteine effectively antagonized the iAs-induced responses in mice. Taken together, these results suggest that iAs-induced oxidative stress causes pancreatic β-cells apoptosis via the mitochondria-dependent and ER stress-triggered signaling pathways.
Sulfadiazine-associated urinary calculi have been described in HIV-positive adult patients but rarely in children. We report two pediatric cases of sulfadiazine-induced nephrolithiasis and review 45 adult cases from the literature. One had a hyper-IgM syndrome and was treated with sulfadiazine for cerebral toxoplasmosis, the other had toxoplasmic retinitis. Both developed multiple bilateral lithiasis with acute renal failure. Normalization of renal function and reduction of calculi size was rapidly achieved after discontinuation of sulfadiazine, hyperhydration, and alkalinization. Bilateral ureteral stents were required in one patient because of anuria.
Pendred syndrome and the enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) are considered phenotypic variations of the same entity due to mutations in the SLC26A4 (pendrin) gene. Pendred syndrome consists in sensorineural deafness, goiter and impaired thyroid hormone synthesis while in EVA thyroid function seems to be preserved. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid function and morphology and to look for mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in patients presented with EVA. Among 57 consecutive patients with sensorineural deafness 15 with EVA, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were identified and studied. A complete evaluation of thyroid function including thyroid echography and perchlorate discharge test was carried out in all patients with EVA; all exons of the SLC26A4 gene were amplified from peripheral leukocytes and directly sequenced, using specific intronic primers. Out of 15 patients with EVA, goiter was present in 8 (53%), hypothyroidism in 7 (47%), increased serum thyroglobulin levels in 8 (53%) and a positive perchlorate discharge test in 10 (67%). Nine alleles of the SLC26A4 gene were mutated: 2 novel mutations (L465W and G497R) and 4 already known mutations (T410M, R409H, T505N and IVS1001+1G>A) were found. Four subjects were compound heterozygous and 1 heterozygous (G497R/wt). All patients harbouring mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had goiter and a positive perchlorate discharge test: 3 were slightly hypothyroid and 2 euthyroid. The remaining 10 patients had no mutations in the SLC26A4 gene: 4 of them were hypothyroid, 2 with goiter and positive perchlorate discharge test, 2 without goiter and with negative perchlorate discharge test. Two patients without mutations were euthyroid with positive perchlorate discharge test. Patients with mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had larger thyroid volume (p<0.002), higher serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (p<0.002) and greater radioiodine discharge after perchlorate (p=0.09) than patients without mutations. The results of the present study lend support to the concept that all patients with mutated SLC26A4 gene have abnormalities of thyroid function tests.
Twenty-eight adult patients with primary refractory or relapsed acute leukemia were treated. The regimens consisted of mitoxantrone plus cytosine arabinoside for 17 patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and mitoxantrone accompanied with vincristine and prednisolone for 11 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In primary refractory patients, 1 of the 4 (25%) ANLL and 1 of the 3 (33%) ALL attained complete remission (CR). Excluding 2 patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation, 8 of the 13 (62%) relapsed ANLL and 4 of the 8 (50%) relapsed ALL achieved CR with a median duration of remission of 6.2 months and 3.8 months, respectively. Myelosuppression occurred in all treatment courses and was associated with pyrexia due to infections in 84% of the cases. Nausea, vomiting and stomatitis were mild. Abnormal liver function tests were observed in 8 (28%) patients. One patient, pretreated with 550 mg/m2 of doxorubicin, developed congestive heart failure. The results suggest that mitoxantrone is of value in the treatment of Chinese patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia.
Intranasal cocaine abuse can lead to destruction of the palate and perforation of the nasal septum. The pathophysiology of cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions is multifactorial and includes local ischemia secondary to vasoconstriction, chemical irritation from adulterants put in "cut" cocaine, and infection secondary to trauma, impaired mucociliary transport, and decreased humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Cocaine abuse should be suspected in patients with a palatal or septal perforation of unknown etiology.
Ethinylestradiol, administered to male Wistar rats for 5 days (5 mg/kg X day), decreased bile flow in anesthetized animals and in isolated perfused livers. The bile salt secretion rate was diminished. The bile-to-perfusate ratios of [14C]sucrose and [14C]inulin increased significantly, but this could be attributed to the decline of bile flow as indicated by almost identical clearance rates. Theorectical analysis according to Forker and Wheeler yielded diffusion permeability coefficients (K) for sucrose and inulin of 0.243 and 0.037 in controls and 0.273 and 0.038 in ethinylestradiol-treated rats. In contrast, 9 h of alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate treatment (250 mg/kg) caused cholestasis with heavily decreased bile salt secretion rates. Here, K-values calculated for sucrose and inulin were 0.807 and 0.175. These findings suggest that altered permeability of the paracellular pathway is the cause for alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate-induced cholestasis, but not the primary event in ethinylestradiol-induced cholestasis.
Induction of fibrosis during prolonged culture of precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) was reported. In this study, the use of rat PCLS was investigated to further characterize the mechanism of early onset of fibrosis in this model and the effects of antifibrotic compounds. Rat PCLS were incubated for 48h, viability was assessed by ATP and gene expression of PDGF-B and TGF-β1 and the fibrosis markers Hsp47, αSma and Pcol1A1 and collagen1 protein expressions were determined. The effects of the antifibrotic drugs imatinib, sorafenib and sunitinib, PDGF-pathway inhibitors, and perindopril, valproic acid, rosmarinic acid, tetrandrine and pirfenidone, TGFβ-pathway inhibitors, were determined. After 48h of incubation, viability of the PCLS was maintained and gene expression of PDGF-B was increased while TGF-β1 was not changed. Hsp47, αSma and Pcol1A1 gene expressions were significantly elevated in PCLS after 48h, which was further increased by PDGF-BB and TGF-β1. The increased gene expression of fibrosis markers was inhibited by all three PDGF-inhibitors, while TGFβ-inhibitors showed marginal effects. The protein expression of collagen 1 was inhibited by imatinib, perindopril, tetrandrine and pirfenidone. In conclusion, the increased gene expression of PDGF-B and the down-regulation of fibrosis markers by PDGF-pathway inhibitors, together with the absence of elevated TGF-β1 gene expression and the limited effect of the TGFβ-pathway inhibitors, indicated the predominance of the PDGF pathway in the early onset of fibrosis in PCLS. PCLS appear a useful model for research of the early onset of fibrosis and for testing of antifibrotic drugs acting on the PDGF pathway.
Microelectrode experiments were performed on papillary muscle of 11 guinea-pigs at driven heart rates of 60 and 120 b.p.m. to study the effect of sotalol 10(-4) M, aprindine 10(-6) M and the combination of both on Vmax, action potential duration and effective refractory period. Only sotalol exerted tonic Vmax block. Aprindine, sotalol and their combination produced an increase in phasic, combined tonic and phasic, and in steady state Vmax block: the effect of the combination on these parameters being larger than the effect of the single agents alone. Action potential duration was lengthened by both drugs and their combination. A statistically significant increase in effective refractory period was observed for sotalol and the combination sotalol-aprindine but not for aprindine. It can be concluded that simultaneous application of sotalol and aprindine enhances phasic, combined tonic and phasic, and steady state Vmax block with an unchanged effect of sotalol on repolarization. The effect of combinations can be explained on the basis of competition for the same receptor in the Na+ channel.
Zinc in the pancreas is co-released with insulin from beta-cells reaching concentrations similar to those found in the vicinity of glutamatergic synapses. In the brain, the role of zinc in excitotoxic brain damage is well established. In contrast, its role in islet destruction during diabetes is poorly understood. We have studied the efficacy of zinc homeostatic proteins and an intracellular zinc chelator, clioquinol, in conferring resistance against zinc toxicity in pancreatic islets. We further assessed the ability of clioquinol to protect the islets in an experimental model of type I diabetes. Our results indicate that endogenous mechanisms for lowering [Zn]i are deficient in the insulinoma cell line, MIN6, and that permeation of Zn2+ triggered cell death. Application of the low affinity, intracellular zinc chelator, clioquinol, reduced Zn2+-induced cell death by 80%. In addition, chelation of zinc ions by clioquinol in vivo prevented onset of multiple low dose streptozotocin-induced diabetes, and reduced the insulitis and hyperglycemia associated with this model. Furthermore, the glucose tolerance test (GTT) score of multiple low dose streptozotocin (MLD-STZ) mice pretreated with clioquinol was, statistically indistinguishable from that of untreated, control mice. Taken together, our results point to the potential utility of in vivo zinc chelation as a therapeutic strategy for treatment of idiopathic type I diabetes.
To report 2 cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) following infusion of ifosfamide.
Two patients who received ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy developed NCSE. One woman received ifosfamide 1000 mg/m2 (1 h infusion on days 1-5); confusion, lethargy, and speech deterioration developed on day 3. The second patient developed similar symptoms on day 3 of treatment with 2500 mg/m2. Both patients responded to intravenous administration of diazepam 10 mg and were given levetiracetam as maintenance therapy.
The severity and presentation of central nervous system toxicity due to ifosfamide varies greatly and involves a spectrum ranging from subclinical electroencephalogram changes to coma. NCSE, an epileptic disorder in which typical convulsive activity is absent, has previously been reported in only 4 patients receiving ifosfamide. Levetiracetam may be used for maintenance antiepileptic therapy after diazepam administration.
Among the many presentations of ifosfamide neurotoxicity, clinicians should consider NCSE as a possible explanation for changes in consciousness in a patient receiving this agent. An objective causality assessment by use of the Naranjo probability scale revealed that NCSE due to ifosfamide was probable.
Amisulpride is a substituted benzamide derivative with atypical antipsychotic properties and low side effects.
We report four cases of patients with clinically and genetically established Huntington's disease and signs of psychosis who were treated with Amisulpride.
Two patients developed extrapyramidal side effects due to the treatment. The antipsychotic therapy of all patients was effective.
Due to degeneration of striatal neurons patients suffering from Huntington's disease react early with development of extrapyramidal side effects after therapy with amisulpride.
The temporal bones of two young adults who developed auditory toxicity during or shortly after a course of aminoglycoside therapy were examined by using light microscopy. Although the organs of Corti were essentially normal, the total number of cochlear ganglion cells was about one-third lower than the number observed in comparable subjects with normal hearing.
The efficacy of extended-release niacin (niacin ER) on lipoprotein subclasses was evaluated in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia using a proton nuclear magnetic resonance method. Paired plasma samples collected at baseline and after 12 weeks' treatment with niacin ER 1,000 (n = 21) or 2,000 (n = 20) mg/day or placebo (n = 19) were available for 60 eligible patients from a previous multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Niacin ER increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides in a dose-dependent manner relative to placebo. Niacin ER increased large HDL particles (H5 and H4, corresponding to the HDL(2ab) fraction) without having a net effect on small HDL particles (H3, H2, and H1, corresponding to the HDL(3abc) fraction). It also decreased smaller, denser LDL particles (L1 and L2) and increased the larger, more buoyant L3 subclass. The inhibitory effect of niacin ER on very low-density lipoprotein was evident on the larger particles (V6, V5, V4, and V3 subclasses) rather than the smaller ones (V2 and V1). The results show that niacin ER produces a beneficial effect on lipoprotein subclasses, specifically decreasing the more atherogenic small, dense LDL particles and enhancing the cardioprotective large HDL particles.
To assess the clinical and molecular genetic studies of patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa associated with a mutation in the arrestin gene.
Results of molecular genetic screening and case reports with DNA analysis and clinical features.
University medical center.
One hundred twenty anamnestically unrelated patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.
DNA analysis was performed by single strand conformation polymorphism followed by nucleotide sequencing to search for a mutation in exon 11 of the arrestin gene. Clinical features were characterized by visual acuity slitlamp biomicroscopy, fundus examinations, fluorescein angiography, kinetic visual field testing, and electroretinography.
We identified 3 unrelated patients with retinitis pigmentosa associated with a homozygous 1-base-pair deletion mutation in codon 309 of the arrestin gene designated as 1147delA. All 3 patients showed pigmentary retinal degeneration in the midperipheral area with or without macular involvement. Patient 1 had a sibling with Oguchi disease associated with the same mutation. Patient 2 demonstrated pigmentary retinal degeneration associated with a golden-yellow reflex in the peripheral fundus. Patients 1 and 3 showed features of retinitis pigmentosa without the golden-yellow fundus reflex.
Although the arrestin 1147delA has been known as a frequent cause of Oguchi disease, this mutation also may be related to the pathogenesis of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. This phenomenon may provide evidence of variable expressivity of the mutation in the arrestin gene.
The Cardiovascular Risk Identification and Treatment Center was established in 1997, adopting a collaborative-care clinic model for the purpose of improving the management of high-risk patients with dyslipidemia. This was a retrospective analysis of 417 high-risk patients with > or =1 year of follow-up laboratory data. Analysis included changes in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), non-HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio; lipoprotein goal achievement; Framingham risk score; liver function; and cardiovascular events. At baseline, 66% of patients had coronary heart disease (CHD) or equivalent risk, 45% were not receiving dyslipidemia therapy, and 29% were on statin monotherapy. After 3 years in the program, 56% were receiving combination therapy, 41% were on monotherapy, and 2% were not on therapy. The 3 most common treatment regimens were statin plus niacin (36%), statin alone (22%), and niacin alone (14%). All lipoproteins improved from baseline (p <0.001). Overall, 62% to 74% of patients reached singular lipid goals and 35% achieved combined lipid goals. Patients with Framingham 10-year CHD risk of >20% were reduced from 6% to <1%. Only 29 patients (7.0%) had a cardiovascular event, including 5 (1.0%) who experienced a myocardial infarction. Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transferase elevation >3 times normal occurred in 1% of patients. In conclusion, a collaborative-care practice model adopting individualized, aggressive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies is highly effective in achieving lipid goals, is sustainable, and is safe. Furthermore, this approach yields reduced projected 10-year CHD risk. A low rate of cardiovascular events was observed.
Transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) is a myeloid proliferation resembling acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), mostly affecting perinatal infants with Down syndrome. Although self-limiting in a majority of cases, TAM may evolve as non-self-limiting AMKL after spontaneous remission (DS-AMKL). Pathogenesis of these Down syndrome-related myeloid disorders is poorly understood, except for GATA1 mutations found in most cases. Here we report genomic profiling of 41 TAM, 49 DS-AMKL and 19 non-DS-AMKL samples, including whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequencing of 15 TAM and 14 DS-AMKL samples. TAM appears to be caused by a single GATA1 mutation and constitutive trisomy 21. Subsequent AMKL evolves from a pre-existing TAM clone through the acquisition of additional mutations, with major mutational targets including multiple cohesin components (53%), CTCF (20%), and EZH2, KANSL1 and other epigenetic regulators (45%), as well as common signaling pathways, such as the JAK family kinases, MPL, SH2B3 (LNK) and multiple RAS pathway genes (47%).
The regulated proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells before the generation and migration of neurons in the cerebral cortex are central aspects of mammalian development. Periventricular neuronal heterotopia, a specific form of mislocalization of cortical neurons, can arise from neuronal progenitors that fail to negotiate aspects of these developmental processes. Here we show that mutations in genes encoding the receptor-ligand cadherin pair DCHS1 and FAT4 lead to a recessive syndrome in humans that includes periventricular neuronal heterotopia. Reducing the expression of Dchs1 or Fat4 within mouse embryonic neuroepithelium increased progenitor cell numbers and reduced their differentiation into neurons, resulting in the heterotopic accumulation of cells below the neuronal layers in the neocortex, reminiscent of the human phenotype. These effects were countered by concurrent knockdown of Yap, a transcriptional effector of the Hippo signaling pathway. These findings implicate Dchs1 and Fat4 upstream of Yap as key regulators of mammalian neurogenesis.
1. The effects of ovariectomy and/or of female hormonal treatments on open-field behavior, apomorphine-induced stereotypies and haloperidol-induced catalepsy were studied in rats. 2. Rat's locomotion frequency was significantly decreased by 17 beta-estradiol and estradiol plus progesterone treatments; this open-field parameter was not affected by progesterone administration per se. 3. 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone treatments, alone or in combination decreased apomorphine-stereotyped behavior. 4. Haloperidol effects were higher in both 17 beta-estradiol and 17 beta-estradiol plus progesterone treated rats. 5. Progesterone treatment alone, decreased the duration of catalepsy induced by the minor (1.0 mg/kg) neuroleptic dose. 6. These results were discussed in the light of a possible interference of estrogen and/or progesterone on dopaminergic transmission at the level of the nigroestratial pathway.
Sulfur mustard (SM), a potent vesicant and chemical warfare agent, induces tissue damage involving an inflammatory response, including vasodilatation, polymorphonuclear infiltration, production of inflammatory mediators, and cyclooxygenase activity. To evaluate the role of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1, COX-2) in sulfur mustard-induced skin toxicity, we applied the agent to the ears of wildtype (WT) and COX-1- and COX-2-deficient mice. In the latter, ear swelling 24 and 48 h after exposure was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by 55% and 30%, respectively, compared to WT. Quantitative histopathology revealed no epidermal ulceration in COX-2-deficient mice but some degree of severity in WT. COX-2-deficient mice showed significant reductions (P < 0.05) in severity of epidermal necrosis (29%), acute inflammation (42%), and hemorrhage (25%), compared to the WT mice. COX-1 deficiency resulted in significant exacerbation (P < 0.05) in severity of some parameters, including increases of 4.6- and 1.2-fold in epidermal ulceration and epidermal necrosis, respectively, compared to WT. Postexposure treatment of normal male ICR mice with the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib resulted in significant reductions of 27% (P < 0.05) and 28% (P < 0.01) in ear swelling at intervals of 40 and 60 min between exposure and treatment, respectively. Histopathological evaluation revealed significant reductions (P < 0.05) in subepidermal microblister formation (73%) and dermal necrosis (32%), compared to the control group. These findings may indicate that COX-2 participates in the early stages of sulfur mustard-induced acute skin toxicity and that COX-1 might exert some protective function against this chemical insult.
Apart from bleeding complications, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II is the most severe side effect of heparin therapy. It is widely agreed that its most important clinical symptom is thrombocytopenia, with or without thromboembolism.Assuming, unlike other authors, that thrombosis is the leading clinical symptom of HIT type II, we investigated the frequency of an immunological reaction indicative of HIT type II in patients suffering from thrombosis. From January 1999 to December 2000, 77% ( n=6713) of our in-patients received heparin for more than 5 days as thrombosis prophylaxis. When thrombosis was suspected on the grounds of clinical appearances, the patient concerned underwent phlebography, and two different serological tests for anti-heparin antibodies were also carried out. In such cases, patients were immediately switched to hirudin instead of heparin. In 29 out of 101 patients, the clinical suspicion of thrombosis was confirmed. Three patients developed pulmonary embolism. In 4 patients both serological tests revealed the presence of anti-heparin antibodies. Three of the remaining 72 patients with negative phlebography results were found to have antibodies on serological testing. In none of the 7 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HIT type II was the classical sign of thrombocytopenia was present. Even with thorough clinical and phlebographic examinations, the incidence of HIT type II is only 0.13% in our institution. One of the 7 patients with thrombosis was not thrombocytopenic but did show the typical immunological reaction. Since the incidence of HIT type II is low and thrombocytopenia is not a reliable indicator for HIT II, the need for frequent thrombocyte counts (twice weekly) should be reconsidered.However,patients developing thrombosis while receiving heparin need to be treated for clinically suspected HIT type II until the final diagnosis is made.
