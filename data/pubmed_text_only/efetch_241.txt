Cocaine-induced lesions may cause extensive destruction of the osteocartilaginous structures of the nose, sinuses, and palate that mimics the clinical picture of other diseases.
From January 1991 to September 2001 25 patients with cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions were observed at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the University of Brescia. The diagnosis was based on physical and endoscopic evaluation, routine blood and urine analysis, radiological findings, and repeated biopsies of the nasal mucosa. Serum was analyzed by the antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test using indirect immunofluorescence and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies against proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase.
Septal perforation was present in all 25 patients, 16 of which (68%) also had partial destruction of the inferior turbinate. Hard palate reabsorption was observed in only six patients (24%); in two of these patients, the lesion also extended to the soft palate. Fourteen patients (56%) were positive by the immunofluorescence test (nine patients had a P-ANCA and five patients a C-ANCA pattern). Four patients (16%) with the P-ANCA pattern and all patients with the C-ANCA pattern also tested positive for anti-proteinase 3 antibodies.
Any sinonasal inflammation involving the midline that persists or remains refractory to treatment may be the first manifestation of potentially lethal drug addiction. Cocaine abuse should be considered in the differential diagnosis of destructive lesions of the nasal cavity even in the presence of a positive ANCA test.
Patients with proteinuric kidney diseases often have symptoms of salt and water retention. It has been hypothesized that dysregulated sodium absorption is due to increased proteolytic cleavage of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) and increased Na,K-ATPase expression. Microarray analysis identified a reduction in kidney corin mRNA expression in rat models of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and acute anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis (GN). As atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) resistance is a mechanism accounting for volume retention, we analyzed the renal expression and function of corin; a type II transmembrane serine protease that converts pro-ANP to active ANP. Immunohistochemical analysis found that corin colocalized with ANP. The nephrotic and glomerulonephritic models exhibited concomitant increased pro-ANP and decreased ANP protein levels in the kidney consistent with low amounts of corin. Importantly, kidneys from corin knockout mice had increased amounts of renal β-ENaC and its activators, phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 and protein kinase G II, when compared to wild-type mice. A similar expression profile was also found in cell culture suggesting the increase in PDE5 and kinase G II could account for the increase in β-ENaC seen in nephrotic syndrome and GN. Thus, we suggest that corin might be involved in the salt retention seen in glomerular diseases.
Cardiovascular complications in patients with carcinoma of the prostate have been studied in relation to 3 methods of treatment, namely stilboestrol, estramustine phosphate (Estracyt) and bilateral orchiectomy. One hundred and sixteen patients were studied over a 4-year period on a prospective basis, 48 being treated with stilboestrol, 31 with estramustine and 37 with bilateral orchiectomy. The incidence of the cardiovascular side effects of these 3 treatment regimes in the first year of treatment was recorded after the patients had been divided into those with localised (MO) disease and advanced disease with metastases (M1). In patients treated with stilboestrol 29% had cardiovascular complications with a mortality rate of 16%. With estramustine 25% had complications with a 16% mortality rate, but with orchiectomy the complication rate was only 8% with a 3% mortality rate. It is recommended that stilboestrol and estramustine phosphate should not be used in the presence of cardiovascular disease and that the primary form of treatment in prostatic carcinoma should be bilateral orchiectomy, especially in patients with localised disease.
We used gene targeting to generate mice lacking the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. These mice exhibit a decreased susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures, loss of regulation of M-current potassium channel activity and of a specific calcium channel pathway in sympathetic neurons, a loss of the positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to the novel muscarinic agonist McN-A-343, and impaired learning in a hippocampal-dependent test of spatial memory.
In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats the left coronary artery was ligated for 5 or 30 min and then opened for reperfusion of the ischemic myocardial area. Twelve min prior to the coronary occlusion yohimbine stereoisomers, namely corynanthine and rauwolscine, or saline solution were given intravenously. In the saline controls both ischemia and reperfusion provoked severe tachyarrhythmias with ventricular fibrillation in 37.5% or 54.6%, respectively. Using corynanthine and rauwolscine a highly significant antiarrhythmic effect was observed. Corynanthine completely prevented ventricular fibrillation and delayed significantly the development of myocardial necrosis. The factors likely underlying the antiarrhythmic and antinecrotic effects are discussed.
Amiodarone (AM) is an antidysrhythmic agent with a propensity to cause pulmonary toxicity, including potentially fatal fibrosis. In the present study, the potential roles of c-Jun and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 in AM-induced inflammation and fibrogenesis were examined after intratracheal administration of AM (1.83 micromol/day on days 0 and 2) or an equivalent volume (0.4 ml) of distilled water to male Fischer 344 rats. Northern and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that lung TGF-beta 1 (mRNA and protein) expression was increased 1.5- to 1.8-fold relative to control during the early inflammation period and 1 day, 1 wk, and 2 wk post-AM treatment. Lung c-Jun protein expression was increased concomitantly with evidence of AM-induced fibrosis; at 5 wk post-AM treatment, c-Jun protein was increased 3.3-fold relative to control. The results indicate a role for induction of c-jun and TGF-beta 1 expression in the development of AM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in the Fischer 344 rat and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
A 70-year-old man was studied both during and after resolution of clinical digoxin toxicity using color vision tests, ganzfeld electroretinography and electro-oculography. Concomitant administration of quinidine sulfate probably contributed to digoxin toxicity. Abnormalities in color vision and subnormal amplitude and prolonged implicit time for cone-mediated electroretinogram (ERG) responses suggested a cone dysfunction syndrome. The electro-oculographic light-to-dark ratio during clinical toxicity was high for our laboratory, but this is probably normal. Notable improvement was seen in color vision and the ERG after cessation of digoxin therapy. Inhibition of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase by digoxin probably influences normal uptake of extracellular potassium by Müller's cells and other retinal neurons. This mechanism may contribute to subnormal, prolonged cone-mediated ERG responses in retinal toxic reactions from cardiac glycosides.
To study the incidence of pain upon injection of 1% propofol (Propofol-Lipuro 1%, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) in a 10% fat emulsion containing equal proportions (50:50) of medium- and long-chain triglycerides.
The subjects were 600 adult patients scheduled for elective surgery. The use of premedication was left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist. All patients received the study anesthetic injected slowly (20-40 mg per 10 seconds) at a dose of 1.5 to 2.5 mg/Kg. Variables recorded were incidence and type of pain upon administering the anesthetic, the patients' clinical characteristics, premedication administered, and method of venous puncture. Bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to determine factors associated with the appearance of pain.
The overall incidence of pain upon administration of propofol-lipuro was 27%. Pain was moderate to intense in 9%. Premedication did not affect the incidence of pain with injection. The risk factors that predicted the appearance of pain were injection through a small-caliber catheter (> 18 G) and injection on the dorsal hand (P < 0.05).
The incidence of pain upon injection of propofol-lipuro is low in comparison with incidence rates reported in the literature for the traditional formula, but administration of the fat emulsion formula through a vein on the dorsal side of the hand or through a venous catheter smaller than 18 G should be avoided. Double-blind randomized controlled trials should be conducted to clarify the advantages that propofol-lipuro seems to offer.
Autosomal-recessive Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) characterized by spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), T-cell immunodeficiency and facial dysmorphism is caused by defects in the SMARCAL1 gene. The gene product is involved in the transcriptional regulation of other genes. A 12-year-old boy of consanginous Turkish descent developed disproportionate short stature from spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia at the age of 6 and nephrotic syndrome at the age of 10 years. Renal biopsy revealed FSGS, the kidney function was normal, T-lymphocytes were diminished without infectious complications, and he has had no cerebral ischemia. Analysis of the patient's SMARCAL1 gene revealed a novel homozygous C1798T transition leading to a R561C substitution. The parents and two healthy sisters were found to be heterozygous. A younger brother, who is also homozygous for the mutation, is clinically asymptomatic and has no proteinuria at the age of 18 months. Still, his CD4 cells are diminished. For SMARCAL1 mutations a clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been reported: severe SIOD with in utero or early-childhood onset leading to end-stage renal disease within a few years is caused by nonsense, frame shift or splice mutations. Many patients die from infections and cerebrovascular insults during childhood. Mild SIOD manifests later and progresses more slowly without infectious or cerebral vascular complications--the underlying defect being missense mutations in all three patients reported so far. The novel R561C missense mutation in our patient with mild SIOD is additional evidence for the genotype-phenotype correlation reported for SMARCAL1 mutations.
An unusual ventricular tachyarrhythmia developed in a 57 year old woman with recurrent ventricular tachycardia and toxic disopyramide plasma concentrations. The rhythm was similar to the patient's previous ventricular tachycardia, but the rate was slower and the QRS complex was markedly widened, mimicking the electrocardiographic changes associated with electrolyte abnormalities. Disopyramide, which has electrophysiologic properties similar to those of quinidine, probably caused the arrhythmia and should be added to the list of drugs associated with atypical ventricular tachycardia.
Increases in the cardiovascular risk marker microalbuminuria are attenuated by blood pressure reduction using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. Such changes in microalbuminuria have not been observed when beta-blockers are used. A prespecified secondary end point of the Glycemic Effects in Diabetes Mellitus Carvedilol-Metoprolol Comparison in Hypertensives (GEMINI) trial was to examine the effects of different beta-blockers on changes in albuminuria in the presence of renin-angiotensin system blockade. Participants with hypertension and type 2 diabetes were randomized to either metoprolol tartrate (n=737) or carvedilol (n=498) in blinded fashion after a washout period of all antihypertensive agents except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Blinded medication was titrated to achieve target blood pressure, with a-5 month follow-up period. The current analysis examined microalbuminuria, using spot urine albumin:creatinine, in participants who had values at screening and trial end. A greater reduction in microalbuminuria was observed for those randomized to carvedilol (-16.2%Delta; 95% confidence interval, -25.3, -5.9; P=0.003). Of those with normoalbuminuria at baseline, fewer progressed to microalbuminuria on carvedilol versus metoprolol (20 of 302 [6.6%] versus 48 of 431 [11.1%], respectively; P=0.03). Microalbuminuria development was not related to differences in blood pressure or achievement of blood pressure goal (68% carvedilol versus 67%, metoprolol). Presence of metabolic syndrome at baseline was the only independent predictor of worsening albuminuria throughout the study (P=0.004). Beta-blockers have differential effects on microalbuminuria in the presence of renin-angiotensin system blockade. These differences cannot be explained by effects on blood pressure or alpha1-antagonism but may relate to antioxidant properties of carvedilol.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk of macrovascular disease. Epidemiological studies suggest that plant polyphenol resveratrol (REV) is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. Since chronic inflammatory and endotheliar cell activation play a critical role in vascular aging and atherogenesis, we evaluated whether REV can inhibit inflammatory-induced vascular injury in T2DM. We found that REV (50 mg/kg/d) can regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, improve insulin resistance and vascular permeability, and protect against the foam cells and cholesterol crystals formation in arterial vessel walls of T2DM rats. The protective effects of REV were consistent with the decrease in nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and there down-regulation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levers in blood and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expressions in vascular wall. In addition, REV (10 and 100 nmol/L) treatment protected cultured endothelial cells against increases in the expression of TNF-α, ICAM-1, and MCP-1 mRNA and protein induced by high glucose via inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B p65. The specific NF-kappa B inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate- (PDTC-) or small interfering RNA directed against NF-kappa B p65-mediated downregulation of NF-kappa B p65 was further enhanced by REV (100 nmol/L) in the human endothelial cell line EZ.hy926. In conclusion, these observations suggest that chronic treatment of T2DM rats with REV attenuates the inflammatory injury of the vascular wall and the effects are associated with down-regulation of the NF-kappa B signal pathway.
A 59-year-old woman treated chronically with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) presented with difficult swallowing and speaking. Although her symptoms were clinically consistent with an adverse angioedema reaction to the ACE-I, initial imaging was not entirely consistent with our conceptual understanding of angioedema. This case report will discuss the myriad possible imaging presentations of this disease, as well as the differential diagnosis for this atypical manifestation of ACE-I-induced angioedema.
A stimulatory effect of intradermal injections of ribomunyl on healing of a skin wound was shown in rats. The effect is based on activation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis and stimulation of neoangiogenesis in newly formed granulation tissue.
Ropivacaine is a local anesthetic frequently used to provide regional blocks because its toxicity threshold is favorable and it is highly selective for sensory nerve fibers. Few reports of adverse events and complications related to use of ropivacaine have been published. We report 2 cases of central nervous system toxicity. Each occurred after a brachial plexus block with 0.75% ropivacaine, one performed by an axillary approach and one by an infraclavicular approach with nerve stimulation.
Patients with asthma incur the risk of steroid-induced myopathy, which is a well-known side effect of treatment with corticosteroids. However, the adverse effect of long-term steroid treatment on respiratory muscle function remains controversial.
We aimed to evaluate the effects of long-term moderate dose of systemic corticosteroids and high-dose inhaled beclomethasone on maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (PImax and PEmax, respectively) in two groups of asthmatic patients exhibiting comparable levels of hyperinflation.
Twelve steroid-dependent asthmatic patients requiring 10-20 mg/day of prednisone-equivalent corticosteroids for an average of 9.83 +/- (SD) 9.86 years; 14 subjects with moderate to severe asthma who have used inhaled beclomethasone for at least 1 year at a daily dose higher than 1,000 microg and 15 healthy controls were included to the study.
No significant difference in pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases appeared between two asthmatic groups with different treatment modalities. PImax as an absolute value was significantly lower in steroid-dependent asthmatics than in patients treated with inhaled beclomethasone and controls (p < 0.01). %PImax was also lower in steroid-dependent asthmatics than in control groups (p < 0.01). A significant correlation was found between %PImax and hyperinflation assessed by %RV, %FRC, %FRC/TLC (p < 0.05) in all asthmatic patients.
We believe that hyperinflation plays a major role in inspiratory muscle dysfunction in asthma, but the finding of significantly decreased PImax values in steroid-dependent asthmatics when compared with patients on high-dose inhaled beclomethasone with a comparable level of hyperinflation points to a deleterious effect of long-term, moderate-dose systemic corticosteroid but not high-dose beclomethasone on inspiratory muscle function in asthmatics.
In a randomized controlled, double-blind clinical trial with 45 patients with moderate hypertension atenolol 100 mg and penbutolol 40 mg were equally effective in lowering the blood pressure. During the 6 weeks of treatment there was no change in body weight and serious side-effects were not observed, but bradycardia occurred more frequently with atenolol than with penbutolol. Withdrawal of medication during the final week of the study did not cause any adverse reaction.
To examine neuronal activation in the spinal cord due to secondary hyperalgesia resulting from intrajoint capsaicin injection, and the effect of physiotherapy manipulation, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in alpha-chloralose anesthetized rats.
FMRI of the rat lumbar spinal cord was performed at 9.4 Tesla. Stimuli included injection of 25 microL of capsaicin (128 microg/mL in 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) into the right forepaw or 75 microL into the right ankle joint followed by a light touch stimulus, with and without physiotherapy manipulation.
Activation of pain areas of the spinal cord (dorsal horn) was found in all animals after injection of capsaicin into the plantar surface of the rat hindpaw and ankle joint. Overlay maps depicting activations and deactivations showed significant reproducibility between experiments. Greater overlay of activations were observed for intrajoint compared to intradermal capsaicin injection. The distribution of activations after stimulation of the hindpaw using a light touch stimulus was somewhat more varied; activation of the dorsal horn was evident, with greater overlap resulting when joint mobilization was not performed.
Results suggest a trend toward decreased areas of activation in the spinal cord associated with pain, as a result of hyperalgesia, following physiotherapy joint mobilization.
New treatments for conduct disorder are sorely needed. We aimed to test the efficacy of divalproex sodium for the treatment of conduct disorder.
Seventy-one youths with conduct disorder according to DSM-IV criteria were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, 7-week clinical trial. Subjects were all adolescent males with at least 1 crime conviction. Subjects were randomized into high- and low-dose conditions and were openly managed by a clinical team. Subjects and independent outcome raters were blinded to condition. Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) ratings, Weinberger Adjustment Inventory ratings, and staff ratings of behavioral privilege were used to assess outcome.
Intent-to-treat analyses showed significant associations between assignment to the high-dose condition and ratings on the CGI-S (p =.02) and CGI-I (p =.0008). Self-reported weekly impulse control was significantly better in the high-dose condition (p <.05), and association between improvement in self-restraint and treatment condition was of borderline statistical significance (p <.06). Parallel analyses comparing outcome by blood drug level achieved strengthened the results, as expected.
This preliminary study in a most difficult population suggests a role for divalproex sodium in the treatment of conduct disorder. Divalproex sodium improved self-reported impulse control and self-restraint, variables shown to be predictive of criminal recidivism. Studies are needed of longer-term impact and side-effect profiles. This is one of few controlled psychopharmacologic studies of conduct disorder.
There is evidence of both immune dysregulation and autoimmune phenomena in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We examined the hormone/cytokine leptin in 70 children diagnosed with autism (including 37 with regression) compared with 99 age-matched controls including 50 typically developing (TD) controls, 26 siblings without autism, and 23 children with developmental disabilities (DD). Children with autism had significantly higher plasma leptin levels compared with TD controls (p<.006). When further sub-classified into regression or early onset autism, children with early onset autism had significantly higher plasma leptin levels compared with children with regressive autism (p<.042), TD controls (p<.0015), and DD controls (p<.004). We demonstrated an increase in leptin levels in autism, a finding driven by the early onset group.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have recently emerged as a new class of anti-cancer agents. Trichostatin A (TSA), a classical HDAC inhibitor, has been demonstrated to induce cell cycle arrest, promote cell apoptosis, and inhibit metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying TSA function has not been fully elucidated. In the current study, we found that TSA treatment induced altered expression of cell cycle-associated genes in HCT116 cells by RT-PCR array. Among the 84 genes related to cell cycle control, 34 genes were significantly altered by TSA treatment, with 7 genes upregulated and 27 genes downregulated. Interestingly, gene expression of minichromosome maintenance protein-2 (MCM-2) was significantly downregulated by TSA treatment. This was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. Moreover, silencing of MCM-2 by siRNA led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HCT116 cells. In addition, TSA caused an increase of phosphorylated JNK, which was involved in downregulation of MCM-2. Together, our results suggest that MCM-2 is a noval therapeutic target of TSA in colon cancer cells.
TEE is a semi-invasive tool broadly used and its utilization associated to sedatives drugs might to affect the procedure safety.
to analyze aspects of TEE safety associated to the use of Midazolan (MZ) and Flumazenil (FL) and the influence of the clinical variables on the event rate.
prospective study with 137 patients that underwent TEE with MZ associated to moderate sedation. We analyzed the following events: complications related with the topical anesthesia, with MZ use and with the procedure. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables: age, sex, stroke, myocardiopathy (MP), duration of the test, mitral regurgitation (MR) and the MZ dose.
All patients (65+/-16 yrs; 58% males) finished the examination. The mean doses of MZ and FL were 4.3+/-1.9 mg and 0.28+/-0.2 mg, respectively. The duration of the examination and the mean ejection fraction (EF) were 16.4+/-6.1 minutes and 60+/-9%, respectively. Mild hypoxia (SO2<90%) was the most common event (11 patients); 3 patients (2%) presented transient hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction by probe introduction and 8 (5.8%) due to hypoxia caused by MZ use. Transient hypotension (SAP<90mmHg) occurred in 1 patient (0.7%). The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR, MP (EF<45%) and high doses of MZ (>5mg) were associated with events (p<0.001). The EF was 40%, in the group with MP and 44% in the group with severe MR and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group.
TEE with sedation presents a low rate of events. There were no severe events and there was no need to interrupt the examinations.
Cryptococcosis is the commonest fungal infection of the CNS and it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunodeficient patients [1]. It has been occasionally described in immunocompetent patients [2]. We report a patient with no predisposing factors who was treated with flucytosine and amphotericin B for cryptococcal meningitis. Following treatment, she developed a reversible acute cerebellar syndrome that was probably secondary to the administration of flucytosine, an adverse effect that has not previously been described [3, 4]. An 87-year old women with no relevant personal or family history was admitted to the hospital for headache, fever, and confusion over the past week. The vital signs, general and neurological examination were normal. In laboratory tests, the urine, urea nitrogen, glucose, bilirubin, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, haematocrit, white-cell count, and platelet were also normal. A lumbar puncture was performed which showed: 60 typical lymphocytes per ml, adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity 6 U.l-1 (normal under 4 U.l-1), proteins 75.7 mg.dl-1, and glucose 13 mg.dl-1 with a glycaemia of 120 mg.dl-1. The microbiology study showed staining and a positive culture for Cryptococcus neoformans, and an antigen titre of 1/2080. The serology for HIV infection was negative, and other predisposing factors for this fungal infection, such as immunological defects, a lymphoreticular malignancy and sarcoidosis were excluded. A CT scan of the cranial-thoracic-abdominal regions was normal and tumour markers were absent.
Lymphedema-distichiasis (LD) is an autosomal dominant disorder that classically presents as lymphedema of the limbs, with variable age at onset, and double rows of eyelashes (distichiasis). Other complications may include cardiac defects, cleft palate, extradural cysts, and photophobia, suggesting a defect in a gene with pleiotrophic effects acting during development. We previously reported neonatal lymphedema, similar to that in Turner syndrome, associated with a t(Y;16)(q12;q24.3) translocation. A candidate gene was not found on the Y chromosome, and we directed our efforts toward the chromosome 16 breakpoint. Subsequently, a gene for LD was mapped, by linkage studies, to a 16-cM region at 16q24.3. By FISH, we determined that the translocation breakpoint was within this critical region and further narrowed the breakpoint to a 20-kb interval. Because the translocation did not appear to interrupt a gene, we considered candidate genes in the immediate region that might be inactivated by position effect. In two additional unrelated families with LD, we identified inactivating mutations-a nonsense mutation and a frameshift mutation-in the FOXC2 (MFH-1) gene. FOXC2 is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcription factors, whose members are involved in diverse developmental pathways. FOXC2 knockout mice display cardiovascular, craniofacial, and vertebral abnormalities similar to those seen in LD syndrome. Our findings show that FOXC2 haploinsufficiency results in LD. FOXC2 represents the second known gene to result in hereditary lymphedema, and LD is only the second hereditary disorder known to be caused by a mutation in a forkhead-family gene.
To report a case of bilateral optic neuropathy in a patient receiving tacrolimus (FK 506, Prograf; Fujisawa USA, Inc, Deerfield, Illinois) for immunosuppression after orthotropic liver transplantation.
Case report. In a 58-year-old man receiving tacrolimus after orthotropic liver transplantation, serial neuro-ophthalmologic examinations and laboratory studies were performed.
The patient had episodic deterioration of vision in both eyes, with clinical features resembling ischemic optic neuropathies. Deterioration of vision occurred despite discontinuation of the tacrolimus.
Tacrolimus and other immunosuppressive agents may be associated with optic nerve toxicity.
Lidocaine and procaine seizure thresholds were studied. The i.p. median convulsant dose (CD50) of lidocaine and procaine with saline pre-treatment was 95 and 240 mg/kg, respectively. Dopamine depletion by pre-treatment with d1-alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine plus dihydroxyphenylserine resulted in a significant drop of CD50 to 69 and 175 mg/kg for lidocaine and procaine, respectively. Serotonin depletion by pre-treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine resulted in a significant drop of CD50 to 68 mg/kg for lidocaine, but no significant change for procaine.
