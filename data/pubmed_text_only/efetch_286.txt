MR of the brain was performed in eight patients (mean age, 14.9 years) with osteogenic sarcoma during or after IV treatment with high-dose methotrexate. MR detected brain abnormalities in four patients, three of whom had concomitant neurologic dysfunction. Pathologic findings demonstrated on MR were (1) chronic brain edema, demonstrable over a period of 3-14 months (proved by autopsy in one patient); (2) multifocal white matter necrosis; and (3) deep brain atrophy. MR appears to be valuable in the detection of abnormalities induced by treatment with high-dose methotrexate.
The development of new pharmacological approaches for preventing muscle wasting in cancer is an important goal because cachectic patients display a reduced response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Xanthine derivatives such as pentoxifylline inhibit tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) production, which has been implicated in the signalling of muscle wasting. However, the effect of pentoxifylline has been inconclusive in clinical trials. We report here the first direct evidence that daily injections of torbafylline (also known as HWA 448), another xanthine derivative, had no effect by itself on muscle proteolysis in control healthy rats. In cancer rats, the drug blocked the lipopolysaccharide-induced hyperproduction of TNF and prevented muscle wasting. In these animals HWA 448 suppressed the enhanced proteasome-dependent proteolysis, which is sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and the accumulation of high-molecular-mass ubiquitin (Ub) conjugates in the myofibrillar fraction. The drug also normalized the enhanced muscle expression of Ub, which prevails in the atrophying muscles from cancer rats. In contrast, HWA 448 did not reduce the increased expression of either the 14 kDa Ub conjugating enzyme E2 or the ATPase and non-ATPase subunits of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome, including the non-ATPase subunit S5a, which recognizes polyUb degradation signals. Finally, the drug also prevented muscle wasting in septic rats (which exhibit increased TNF production), and was much more potent than pentoxifylline or other xanthine derivatives. Taken together, the data indicate that HWA 448 is a powerful inhibitor of muscle wasting that blocks enhanced Ub-proteasome-dependent proteolysis in situations where TNF production rises, including cancer and sepsis.
Verapamil-sensitive fascicular ventricular tachycardia (VT) of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and superior axis pattern is typically seen in young patients with structurally normal hearts and considered "idiopathic". Recently, involvement of the Purkinje system in post-infarction monomorphic VT that mimics such idiopathic fascicular VT has been described. In this report we describe a case of a patient who following myocardial infarction developed left posterior fascicular Purkinje reentrant VT that was sensitive to verapamil. The VT was successfully treated by radiofrequency ablation guided by three dimensional electroanatomical CARTO mapping. Our case highlights that involvement of Purkinje fibers should be considered in post infarction patients with VT of narrow QRS duration, RBBB morphology and superior axis. Recognition of such VT is clinically important, as this arrhythmia is amenable to curative catheter ablation.
Thiopurine drugs have to be withdrawn in 10-30% of cases due to side effects, and it has been presented that genetic factors may be responsible for some of reported toxicity cases. Among polymorphic enzymes of thiopurines' metabolic pathway, thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) has been studied most extensively, and some recent studies point to inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPA) polymorphism as an additional toxicity risk factor.
The aim of the current study was to evaluate an association between TPMT and ITPA gene polymorphisms and drug intolerance in a cohort of 157 renal transplant recipients treated with azathioprine (AZA). Each subject was genotyped for the presence of variant TPMT (*2, *3A, *3B, and *3C) and ITPA (94C>A and IVS2+21A>C) alleles.
Mean AZA dose, mean white-blood-cell count, and platelet count in the course of treatment were lower in carriers of variant TPMT alleles compared to patients with TPMT wild-type genotype. Leukocyte numbers fell below 4.0 x 10(9)/L in 41.2% of TPMT heterozygous renal transplant recipients, compared to only 18.0% of wild-type patients (P < 0.01). In contrast, ITPA genotype did not influence AZA dose, hematological parameters, or leucopenia risk.
Our results suggest that routine genotyping of renal transplant recipients for TPMT variants may be useful in reducing the risk of AZA-related myelotoxicity, but there is not enough evidence to introduce ITPA testing into clinical practice.
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a rare form of acute myeloid leukemia. The specific translocation t(15;17), which results in the fusion gene PML-RARA is the diagnostic and pathomechanistic hallmark of APL. By combination, treatment consisting of the differentiating agent all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which targets this molecular lesion, and cytotoxic chemotherapy, cure can be achieved in over 70% of patients. Recently, arsenic trioxide (ATO) has emerged to be the most active single agent in the treatment of APL. Previous studies employing ATO in relapse settings reported average complete remission rates of 85% and a mean overall survival of over 60%. In recent approaches installing ATO in first-line treatment, ATO-induced response rates comparable to previous combination regimen. The results of these newer studies indicate that the backbone of chemotherapy can be dramatically reduced or completely replaced by ATO and ATRA with similar or even better outcome.
We compared the efficacy of ceftriaxone combined with gentamicin, both given once a day, with that of cloxacillin given every 4 h plus gentamicin given once a day or in three daily doses (t.i.d.) for the treatment of experimental methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal endocarditis. The antibiotics were administered by using human-like (H-L) pharmacokinetics that simulated the profiles of these drugs in human serum. Animals with catheter-induced endocarditis were infected intravenously with 10(5) CFU of Staphylococcus aureus S5 (MICs and minimal bactericidal concentrations of cloxacillin, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin, 0.5 and 2 microg/ml, 4 and 8 microg/ml, and 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively). The animals were then treated for 24 h with cloxacillin at a dose of 2 g that simulated H-L pharmacokinetics (H-L 2 g) every 4 h alone or combined with gentamicin (administered at doses of H-L 1 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h or H-L 4.5 mg/kg every 24 h) or with ceftriaxone at H-L 2 g every 24 h alone or combined with gentamicin (administered at doses of H-L 1 mg/kg every 8 h or H-L 4.5 mg/kg every 24 h). The results of therapy for experimental endocarditis due to the S5 strain showed that (i) cloxacillin alone is more effective than ceftriaxone alone in reducing the bacterial load (P < 0.01), (ii) the combination of cloxacillin or ceftriaxone with gentamicin is more effective than each of these drugs alone (P < 0.01), and (iii) Ceftriaxone H-L plus gentamicin H-L 4.5 mg/kg, both administered every 24 h, showed efficacy similar to that of the "gold standard," cloxacillin H-L plus gentamicin H-L 1 mg/kg t.i.d. (P > 0.05). An increase in the interval of administration of gentamicin to once daily resulted in a reduction in the numbers of bacteria in the vegetations equivalent to that achieved with the recommended regimen of cloxacillin plus gentamicin t.i.d. in the treatment of experimental endocarditis due to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Ceftriaxone plus gentamicin, both administered once a day, may be useful for home-based therapy for selected cases of staphylococcal endocarditis.
Apparently for the first time, the peripheral blood monocytes of individuals with active visceral leishmaniasis (VL) have been found to show reduced expression of interferon gamma receptor-1 (IFNGR1). Since interferon gamma is the main cytokine responsible for defence against leishmanial parasites, it was thought possible that effective antileishmanial drugs may up-regulate IFNGR1. Confocal microscopy confirmed that monocytes from VL patients who had been treated, with sodium antimony gluconate (SAG), did display IFNGR1 up-regulation. To see if this effect could be mimicked in vitro, IFNGR1 expression was investigated using a human macrophage cell line (THP1), northern blotting and confocal microscopy. When the THP1 cells were treated with SAG or pentamidine, their expression of the receptor was increased. This drug-induced up-regulation was more intense if the macrophages were infected with Leishmania donovani than if they were left uninfected. The possibility that at least some antileishmanial drugs act by up-regulating IFNGR1 expression needs to be explored further. A good model for investigating the mechanisms of action of antileishmanial drugs might be based on the THP1 cell line.
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects of the selective serotonin (5-HT) agonist lorcaserin are reviewed, with an emphasis on efficacy and safety data from Phase III clinical trials.
Lorcaserin is highly selective for a subtype of 5-HT receptors important in appetite regulation, with low affinity for other 5-HT-receptor subtypes whose activation is thought to underlie serious cardiovascular adverse effects; such effects have been seen with nonselective serotonergic agents for weight loss (e.g., fenfluramine). In two Phase III trials of lorcaserin, the cumulative proportion of patients who achieved weight loss of â‰¥5% over 12 months was about 47% with lorcaserin use versus 20-25% among placebo users (p < 0.0001 for both trials). Lorcaserin was generally well tolerated in the clinical trials to date; nausea and vomiting, headache, and dizziness were the most commonly reported adverse effects. In two of the three Phase III trials to date, lorcaserin use was not found to increase the risk of cardiac valvulopathy; however, in the other Phase III trial, which focused on patients with diabetes, lorcaserin use was associated with an increased rate of new valvulopathy. In a carcinogenicity evaluation involving laboratory rats, lorcaserin was linked to the development of various malignancies, a finding with uncertain implications for its potential future use in humans.
Lorcaserin, a 5-HT(2C) agonist, has demonstrated efficacy in patients who are obese or are overweight with associated comorbidities. Phase III trials have found that more than 35% of patients lost greater than 5% of their baseline weight. The maker of lorcaserin has indicated it will continue to seek U.S. marketing approval of the drug for the indications of long-term weight loss and weight-loss maintenance in specific patient populations.
Atherogenic dyslipidemia is emerging as a target of lipid-modifying therapy. However, an optimal pharmacologic approach has not yet been established. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the typical doses of fenofibrate and niacin.
After an eight-week dietary run-in, 201 patients who had triglyceride (TG) levels of 150-499 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels of <45 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of <130 mg/dL were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for 16 weeks: fenofibrate 160 mg or niacin extended release 1500 mg (starting at 500 mg and up-titrated at the fifth and ninth weeks).
One hundred forty patients completed the study. The percent reductions in apoB/A1 were not different between the two groups (-20% and -22% in the fenofibrate and niacin groups, respectively, p=0.47). The effects of the two regimens on HDL-C were similar (24% and 20%, respectively, p=0.22), while fenofibrate reduced TG more than did niacin (-53% and -48%, respectively, p=0.045). Niacin was more effective at lowering LDL-C, Lp (a), and hs-CRP. However, niacin worsened the parameters of glycemic control, whereas fenofibrate improved them. Niacin showed more frequent adverse events including pruritus and skin flushing.
These two regimens have largely comparable lipid-modifying effects. However, their effects on glucose metabolism and inflammation, and their adverse events need to be considered additionally. Our results underscore more individualized pharmacologic approaches to patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia.
There is a new, potentially fatal disorder that is infrequently reported. The apparent rareness may be because of a lack of recognition of the syndrome or its predisposing factors. Fluoxetine (Prozac, Dista Products Co, Division of Eli Lilly Co, Indianapolis, IN), sertraline (Zoloft, Roerig Division, Pfizer Inc, New York, NY), and paroxetine (Paxil, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) belong to a new class of antidepressant medication: the serotonin reuptake-inhibitors (SRIs). The relative safety profile of the SRIs has led to their widespread use. However, a syndrome of excessive serotonergic activity, the "serotonin syndrome" (SS), has recently been recognized. It is characterized by changes in mental status, hypertension, restlessness, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, and tremor. A high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis in these acutely ill patients. The most common agents implicated in SS are the monoamine oxidase inhibitors in combination with L-tryptophan or fluoxetine. A case of a patient with significant peripheral vascular disease who developed SS while taking paroxetine and an over-the-counter cold medicine is reported. There have been no prior reports of this interaction. Discontinuation of the offending agents, sedation, and supportive care are the mainstays of treatment. The interactions of serotonin with platelets and vascular endothelium are also discussed.
To clarify the roles of tachykinins in volume-induced micturition and in bladder hyperactivity, presumed to originate from supraspinal structures, normal, female Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated cystometrically before and after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) administration of RP 67,580, a selective antagonist of NK-1 receptors, and/or SR 48,968, a selective antagonist of NK-2 receptors. The effects of RP 67,580 and SR 48,968 on intra-peritoneal (i.p.) L-dopa-induced bladder hyperactivity were also investigated. I.c.v. administration of RP 67,580 (20 nmol) SR 48,968 (20 nmol) suppressed micturition. Combination of i.c.v. RP 67, 580 (2 nmol) and SR 48,968 (2 nmol) significantly decreased micturition pressure (18%), and increased bladder capacity (26%), micturition volume (18%), and residual volume (223%). In rats pretreated with i.p. carbidopa 50 mg/kg, i.p. L-dopa 50 mg/kg caused bladder hyperactivity that was attenuated by the combination of i.c. v. RP 67,580 (2 nmol) and SR 48,968 (2 nmol). The results suggest that tachykinins, via stimulation of NK receptors in supraspinal structures, are involved in both volume and L-dopa-induced stimulation of bladder activity. This may imply that tachykinins can influence both the supraspinal and spinal control of the urinary bladder. It also implies that supraspinal NK receptors are a possible target for drugs aimed for elimination of bladder hyperactivity mediated via these pathways. Neurourol. Urodynam. 19:101-109, 2000.
The present study evaluated the involvement of opioidergic and catecholaminergic mechanisms in the hypotensive action of pindolol. Pindolol (1 mg/kg i.a.) was administered to unanesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats instrumented for direct arterial pressure monitoring. Peripheral administration of pindolol produced a significant decrease in blood pressure in both SHR and WKY rats with SHR animals having a greater response. Heart rate was reduced in SHR; however, a tachycardia was observed in WKY rats. Pretreatment with naloxone (100 micrograms/kg i.a.) 10 min prior to pindolol administration prevented the hypotensive response. Similar pretreatment with yohimbine, an alpha 2-receptor antagonist, also prevented the pindolol-induced hypotensive response in both SHR and WKY rats. Neither naloxone nor yohimbine alone significantly affected blood pressure or heart rate. These results suggest that opioidergic and catecholaminergic mechanisms are involved in the hypotensive action of pindolol.
Brominated flame retardants (BFRs), used in many types of consumer goods, are being studied because of concerns about possible health effects related to endocrine disruption, immunotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and neurotoxicity. Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), the most widely used BFR, and human metabolites of certain congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ether (e.g., 3-OH-BDE-47) have been suggested to inhibit estrogen sulfotransferase, potentially affecting estrogen metabolism.
Our primary goal was to understand the structural mechanism for inhibition of the hormone-metabolizing enzyme estrogen sulfotransferase by certain BFRs. We also sought to understand various factors that facilitate the binding of flame retardants in the enzyme binding pocket.
We used X-ray crystallography to obtain atomic detail of the binding modes of TBBPA and 3-OH-BDE-47 to estrogen sulfotransferase for comparison with binding of the endogenous substrate estradiol.
The crystal structures reveal how BFRs mimic estradiol binding as well as the various interactions between the compounds and protein residues that facilitate its binding. In addition, the structures provide insights into the ability of the sulfotransferase substrate binding pocket to accommodate a range of halogenated compounds that satisfy minimal structural criteria.
Our results show how BFRs or their metabolites can bind to and inhibit a key hormone-metabolizing enzyme, potentially causing endocrine disruption.
A group of 145 high-risk patients who underwent angiography after administration of the nonionic contrast agent iohexol were monitored for the development of acute renal dysfunction. The results in this group were compared with those in 202 high-risk historical control subjects who had undergone angiography after administration of ionic contrast material. All patients in both groups received similar pre- and postangiographic treatment. A greater number of patients in the ionic group had preexisting renal disease, were of advanced age, and had received large volumes of contrast material. Acute renal dysfunction occurred in 20 of the 202 (10%) patients in the ionic group, compared with eight of the 145 (5.5%) patients in the nonionic group; this difference is not statistically significant. Five patients in the ionic group, but none of the patients in the nonionic group, ultimately required dialysis; this difference is not statistically significant. The findings suggest that a randomized trial in high-risk patients should be undertaken before a clinical advantage of the nonionic contrast agent iohexol with regard to renal function can be assumed.
The case reports about the neurological sides effects of amodiaquine are scare, and just a few of them concerned the children. But more and more, amodiaquine is prescribed because of the resistance of Plasmodium in front of chloroquine. And, in the endemic area of malaria, there are more and more neurological side effects with amodiaquine among the children. From a retrospective study, from January 1998 to June 2000, the authors described 35 case reports of children aged from 5 months to 15 years who presented neurological side effects after taking amodiaquine in endemic malarial area. The aim of this study is, first to inform the pediatricians in our area about these side effects, as they are not mentioned in therapeutic guides. Second, it shows that it is not exceptional in the endemic area of malaria.
Chemotherapy has cachectic effects, but it is unknown whether cytostatic agents alter skeletal muscle proteolysis. We hypothesized that chemotherapy-induced alterations in protein synthesis should result in the increased incidence of abnormal proteins, which in turn should stimulate ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent proteolysis. The effects of the nitrosourea cystemustine were investigated in skeletal muscles from both healthy and colon 26 adenocarcinoma-bearing mice, an appropriate model for testing the impact of cytostatic agents. Muscle wasting was seen in both groups of mice 4 days after a single cystemustine injection, and the drug further increased the loss of muscle proteins already apparent in tumor-bearing animals. Cystemustine cured the tumor-bearing mice with 100% efficacy. Surprisingly, within 11 days of treatment, rates of muscle proteolysis progressively decreased below basal levels observed in healthy control mice and contributed to the cessation of muscle wasting. Proteasome-dependent proteolysis was inhibited by mechanisms that include reduced mRNA levels for 20S and 26S proteasome subunits, decreased protein levels of 20S proteasome subunits and the S14 non-ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome, and impaired chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities of the enzyme. A combination of cisplatin and ifosfamide, two drugs that are widely used in the treatment of cancer patients, also depressed the expression of proteasomal subunits in muscles from rats bearing the MatB adenocarcinoma below basal levels. Thus, a down-regulation of ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent proteolysis is observed with various cytostatic agents and contributes to reverse the chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting.
Many epileptic patients suffer from cognitive impairments; both the underlying pathology and antiepileptic drug therapy can cause such deficits. Phenytoin, one of the widely used anticonvulsants, is known to adversely affect cognitive function. A reputed Indian nootropic plant Bacopa monniera (BM) was evaluated alone and in combination with phenytoin for its effect on (a) passive-avoidance (PA) task; (b) maximal electroshock seizures; and (c) locomotor activity in mice. Phenytoin (PHT, 25 mg/kg po x 14 days) adversely affected cognitive function in the PA task. BM extract (40 mg/kg x 7 days), given along with phenytoin in the second week of the two-week regimen, significantly reversed PHT-induced impairment. Both acquisition and retention of memory showed improvement without affecting its anticonvulsant activity. The observed cognitive effects of PHT and BM were found to be independent of motor stimulation. The results provide evidence for potential corrective effect of BM in cognitive deficit associated with PHT therapy.
The standard antitubercular treatment (ATT), which consists of isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol, and pyrazinamide (PZA), is the best available treatment for tuberculosis (TB). However, the hepatotoxicity of INH and PZA can be severe, and even after drug withdrawal, patients may require liver transplantation (LT). In these cases, the strategy for the treatment of TB is poorly defined. Between 1986 and 2008, 14 patients presented at our department with severe hepatitis secondary to INH and PZA treatment. Four of these patients were immunosuppressed: 2 after renal transplantation and 2 because of human immunodeficiency virus infection. In seven of the 14 patients an alternative ATT was begun on admission, which was well tolerated. Hepatitis improved spontaneously in 5 patients, and alternative ATT was continued for 9.3 Â± 4.2 months; 1 patient deteriorated and underwent LT, and 1 patient died. ATT was stopped definitively in 2 patients. Six patients required urgent LT, and alternative ATT was started after transplantation and was successful. Five patients receiving RIF had an episode of acute rejection. In conclusion, hepatitis secondary to ATT can be successfully treated with alternative anti-TB regimens. The use of RIF in LT patients may lead to acute rejection. RIF should therefore be avoided in these patients.
Prostate cancer is the most predominant cancer in men and related death rate increases every year. Till date, there is no effective therapy for androgen independent prostate cancer. Previous studies reported that aged garlic extract suppresses cancer growth. In the present study, diallyl disulfide [DADS], oil soluble organosulfur compound of garlic, was studied for its antiproliferative and induction of cell cycle arrest on prostate cancer cells in vitro. The suppression of cell growth was assessed by MTT assay. Induction of cell cycle arrest was assessed and confirmed by propidium iodide staining in flowcytometric analysis and western blotting analysis of major cell cycle regulator proteins. The results showed that DADS inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells in a dose dependent manner, compared to the control. At 25 microM and 40 microM concentrations, DADS induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M transition in PC-3 cells. Western blotting analysis of cyclin A, B(1) and cyclin dependent kinase 1 [CDK1] revealed that DADS inhibited the cell cycle by downregulating CDK1 expression. It is concluded that DADS, inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells through cell cycle arrest. Dose dependent effect of DADS on PC-3 cell line was observed in the present study.
Curative potential of riboflavin, niacin and ascorbic acid against tamoxifen mediated endometrial carcinoma was established by studies on carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes. The enzymes investigated were glycolytic enzymes namely, hexokinase; aldolase; phosphoglucoisomerase and the gluconeogenic enzymes namely, glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1, 6-biphosphatase in endometrial carcinoma bearing rats. A significant increase in glycolytic enzymes and a subsequent decrease in gluconeogenic enzymes were observed in plasma, liver and kidney of endometrial carcinoma animals. The administration of riboflavin (45 mg/kg bw/day), niacin (100 mg/kg bw/day) and ascorbic acid (200 mg/kg bw/day) along with tamoxifen (45 mg/kg bw/day) caused a significant decrease in the activity of glycolytic enzymes and a significant increase in the activities of gluconeogenic enzymes to near normal levels in experimental animals. Our results suggest that riboflavin, niacin and ascorbic acid have potential combination therapy against tamoxifen mediated secondary endometrial carcinoma in experimental rats. However, there were no deleterious side effects observed in combinants alone treated animals.
