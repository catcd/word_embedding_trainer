To describe the first case of bortezomib-induced capillary leak syndrome (CLS), a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the shift of intravascular fluid and protein to the interstitial space.
A 65-year-old female with relapsed multiple myeloma developed fluid retention, ascites, and general anasarca following bortezomib administration (1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11). Aggressive albumin infusion and loop diuretics did not lead to improvement and the patient received 2 sessions of hemodialysis for pulmonary edema. Although the bortezomib dose was reduced (0.7 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, and 11) for the second cycle, CLS recurred after treatment. Dexamethasone was given along with bortezomib in the third cycle and subsequent CLS was prevented. The patient's multiple myeloma responded partially to the treatment, but the patient later died from cardiac amyloidosis.
Bortezomib is associated with several well-known adverse effects, such as peripheral neuropathy, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal complications. CLS has not previously been reported to be associated with bortezomib. In this case, CLS developed twice after the patient received bortezomib treatment. The severity of CLS was dose-dependent and this adverse effect was preventable by concomitant use of steroids; this clearly demonstrated the close relationship between CLS and bortezomib in this patient. Using the Naranjo probability scale, the occurrence of CLS related to bortezomib treatment was probable.
Our report demonstrates CLS as an unusual adverse effect of bortezomib. As bortezomib use may become more common, clinicians should be aware of this novel but potentially life-threatening adverse effect. Based on our experience, timely management with steroids is important in dealing with this complication.
Minoxidil is a potent antihypertensive which is reserved for severe cases. A 58-year-old man admitted for evaluation of progressive dyspnea and peripheral edema had been taking Minoxidil, Normiten and Lasix for severe hypertension. Echocardiography disclosed a massive pericardial effusion but there were no signs of tamponade. Discontinuation of Minoxidil resulted in complete clearance of the pericardial fluid within 3 months. Awareness of this potentially fatal side-effect of Minoxidil is mandatory.
To determine if the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices hepatitis B screening, vaccination, and prophylaxis recommendations were being followed in North Carolina, and to establish a baseline hepatitis B seroprevalence rate.
A survey of mother and infant birthing facility medical records.
Four birthing facilities selected from each of the 7 districts in North Carolina (a total of 28 facilities).
A probability proportional to size survey design was used to select 4763 mother-infant record pairs. All records came from the 1996 birth cohort.
Maternal hepatitis B screening status, infant vaccination status, infants prophylaxis status, hepatitis B seroprevalence rate, demographic and clinical predictors for maternal infection, failure to receive prenatal care or for whom status was unknown, failure to screen, and failure to vaccinate.
Ninety-two percent of pregnant women were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen. Eighty-six percent of infants received dose 1 of the hepatitis B vaccine. Four of the 9 infants with mothers who were hepatitis B surface antigen-positive did not receive both vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin. The hepatitis B seroprevalence rate was 0.2%. Mothers who were not screened for infection were 3.4 times more likely to have infants who were not vaccinated. White mothers were twice as likely not to have their child vaccinated as mothers of other races.
Not all infants with hepatitis B-infected mothers were receiving vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin as recommended. Seroprevalence of hepatitis B infection may be lower in North Carolina than in other states. Hepatitis B laboratory test results should be included in every mother's medical record.
Macrophage-derived foam cells are known to play an essential role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Probucol prevents oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and lowers plasma contents of LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). A recent report using apoE -/- mice demonstrated that probucol treatment enhanced atherosclerosis in apoE -/- mice more rapidly than that in untreated apoE -/- mice, and a reduction in plasma cholesterol by probucol was not the cause of enhancement of atherosclerotic lesions in probucol-treated apoE -/- mice. Moreover, probucol was reported to inhibit apoA-I mediated cholesterol efflux from mouse macrophages. These reports suggested that probucol might directly affect cholesterol metabolism in mouse macrophages. Thus, we investigated the effects of probucol on cholesterol metabolism in mouse resident peritoneal macrophages. Probucol did not affect degradation of acetylated LDL (Ac-LDL), degradation of LDL and endogenous cholesterol synthesis in mouse macrophages. However, it significantly inhibited HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. Moreover, probucol partially (30%) inhibited the binding of HDL to mouse macrophages, and significantly activated acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). Our results suggested that probucol inhibited HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux by inhibiting the binding of HDL to mouse macrophages and reducing HDL-accessible free cholesterol content by ACAT activation, thereby worsening atherosclerotic lesions in apoE -/- mice. However, it remains unclear whether probucol inhibits HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from human macrophages.
To determine whether combined modality therapy (CMT) is superior to chemotherapy (CT) alone, 152 untreated Hodgkin disease patients with clinical stages (CSs) IA, IB, IIA, IIB, and IIIA without bulk disease were prospectively randomized to 6 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) alone or 6 cycles of ABVD followed by radiation therapy (RT) (3600 cGy: involved field for 11 patients, modified extended field for the rest). Of 76 patients randomized to receive RT, 65 actually received it, and 11 did not (4 progressed, 1 had bleomycin toxicity, 6 refused). For ABVD + RT, the complete remission (CR) percentage was 94% and no major response, 6%. For ABVD alone, 94% achieved a CR; 1.5%, a partial response (PR); and 4.5%, no major response. At 60 months CR duration, freedom from progression (FFP), and overall survival (OS) for ABVD + RT versus ABVD alone are 91% versus 87% (P = .61), 86% versus 81% (P = .61), and 97% versus 90% (P = .08), respectively (log-rank). The 95% confidence intervals for CR duration, FFP, and OS differences at 5 years were -8% to 15%, -8% to 18%, and -4% to 12%, respectively. Although significant differences were not seen, it is possible that a benefit in outcome of less than 20% for CMT might be seen in a larger trial.
It has frequently been reported that a high percentage of individuals, identified as either alcohol- or cocaine-dependent, concurrently abuse both drugs. The experiments reported here represent a continuing effort to develop an animal model to predict the effects of a potential pharmacotherapeutic agent on concurrently available oral ethanol and cocaine. These experiments utilized drinkometer circuitry to assess the effects of gamma-vinyl-GABA (GVG), a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase inhibitor, on the consumption and temporal pattern of responses for orally self-administered ethanol and cocaine. The results of these experiments showed that GVG, at doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg, reduced both ethanol and cocaine consumption in a dose-related manner. When compared to vehicle, GVG at all doses significantly reduced ethanol consumption while consumption of cocaine was significantly reduced only at 300 mg/kg. This is consistent with data showing that GVG reduces consumption of these drugs when administered alone and data showing that GVG is more potent in reducing ethanol-induced compared to cocaine-induced extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Analysis of the temporal pattern of drinking across the session suggests that GVG's effects are due to a disruption of the reinforcing properties of ethanol and cocaine rather than a more general reduction in motor behavior. These data suggest that GVG has potential for clinical use in populations that abuse either alcohol or cocaine alone or in combination.
In the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety, nicotine (0.1 mg/kg sc; 30 min after injection) had a significant anxiogenic effect, shown by specific decreases in the percentage of time spent on the open arms and in the percentage of open-arm entries. Tolerance developed to this anxiogenic effect after 7 days of nicotine treatment (0.1 mg/kg/day). Five minutes after an acute injection, nicotine (0.1 mg/kg) was ineffective, but after 7 days of treatment a significant anxiolytic effect, shown by specific increases in the percentage of time spent on the open arms and in the percentage of open-arm entries, emerged. After 14 days of nicotine treatment, tolerance developed to this anxiolytic effect. There was a complete dissociation between the effects of nicotine on the measures of anxiety, and on the locomotor activity as measured by closed-arm entries. No changes in closed-arm entries were found after acute administration of nicotine, but rats tested 30 min after their 7th injection made significantly fewer, and those tested 5 min after their 14th injection made significantly more, entries than their respective controls. Rats that were tested after 24 h withdrawal from six daily nicotine injections showed a significant anxiogenic effect. A low dose of nicotine (5 ng) injected into the dorsal hippocampus was without effect in vehicle pretreated rats, but it was able to reverse the anxiogenic effect found after 24 h of withdrawal from 6 days of nicotine treatment.
To study the relationship between the apoptosis of retinal neurons and changes of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity and mRNA expression in early diabetic rats.
Controlled experimental study. Seventy two male 8-week-aged SD rats were divided into control group and diabetic mellitus group. Each group were subdivided into 4, 8 and 12 weeks groups (each group, n = 12). The diabetic group rats were injected with a single dose of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) to induce the diabetic model, the control group rats were raised without any intervention. Apoptosis of retinal neurons was detected by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end label (TUNEL) assay. The protein expression of caspase-3 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Xanthine oxidase method was used to measure the activity of MnSOD and copper-znic superoxide dismutase (Cu-ZnSOD). MnSOD mRNA, Cu-ZnSODmRNA and caspase-3 mRNA levels were determined by SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix. ANOVA was used to test the comparisons of the apoptosis ratio of retinal ganglion cells, the levels of caspase-3 mRNA, and the activity and mRNA levels of Cu-ZnSOD and MnSOD in the control groups and the diabetic groups, and LSD was used to test multiple comparisons.
(1) The difference of the retinal ganglion cells apoptosis ratio in the control groups and the diabetic groups had statistical significance at 4, 8, 12 weeks (F = 19.5412, P < 0.05). There were no apoptosis neurons in control groups' retina at 4, 8, 12 weeks. Apoptosis of the retinal neurons occurred 4 weeks after the onset of diabetes. The apoptosis ratio of retinal ganglion cells in rats that had diabetes for 8 and 12 weeks was (5.7 +/- 3.9)% and (11.8 +/- 5.1)%, respectively, and was significantly higher than that of age-matched control groups (8 and 12 weeks: P = 0.000). (2) Caspase-3 protein expression was not observed in the control rats' retina at 4, 8, 12 weeks. Positive staining of caspase-3 occurred 4 weeks after the onset of diabetes, and enhanced at 8 and 12 weeks. The difference of caspase-3 mRNA levels in the control groups and the diabetic groups had statistical significance at 4, 8, 12 weeks (F = 105.175, P < 0.05). In control rats at 4, 8 and 12 weeks, caspase-3 mRNA levels were 1.649 +/- 0.586, 1.526 +/- 0.486, 1.614 +/- 0.296, respectively. Caspase-3 mRNA levels in diabetic rats that had diabetes for 4, 8 and 12 weeks were 5.672 +/- 1.193, 12.566 +/- 2.272, 14.297 +/- 2.11, respectively, which were greater than that in the control groups (4, 8 and 12 weeks: P = 0.000). (3) The difference of the activity and mRNA levels of MnSOD and Cu-ZnSOD in the control groups and the diabetic groups had statistical significance at 4, 8, 12 weeks (MnSOD: activity: F = 19.709, P < 0.05, mRNA: F = 93.352, P < 0.05; Cu-ZnSOD: activity: F = 16.708, P < 0.05, mRNA: F = 16.332, P < 0.05). In the control groups at 4, 8 and 12 weeks, the activity of MnSOD was (47.118 +/- 5.018), (46.033 +/- 6.835) and (45.813 +/- 6.859) U/mg, respectively; and MnSOD mRNA levels were 0.973 +/- 0.123, 0.974 +/- 0.085 and 0.994 +/- 0.074, respectively. The activity of Cu-ZnSOD was (113.884 +/- 9.07), (112.301 +/- 5.24) and (117.52 +/- 7.982) U/mg, respectively; and Cu-ZnSOD mRNA levels of were 1.067 +/- 0.109, 1.055 +/- 0.119, 1.092 +/- 0.180, respectively. In the rats that had diabetes for 4, 8 and 12 weeks, the activity of MnSOD was (33.863 +/- 6.909), (22.877 +/- 7.875) and (20.034 +/- 6.796) U/mg, respectively; and MnSOD mRNA levels were 0.627 +/- 0.083, 0.333 +/- 0.080, 0.256 +/- 0.057, respectively; these data were less than those in the age-matched control groups (activity: 4 weeks: P = 0.002, 8 and 12 weeks: P = 0.000; mRNA: 4, 8 and 12 weeks: P = 0.000). The activity (109.793 +/- 7.468) U/mg and mRNA level (0.976 +/- 0.108) of Cu-ZnSOD in rats had diabetes for 4 weeks showed no significant difference as compared to age-matched control group (activity: P = 0.426; mRNA: P = 0.172). In diabetic rats at 8 and 12 weeks, the activity of Cu-ZnSOD was (98.588 +/- 9.212) and (78.168 +/- 12.180) U/mg, respectively; Cu-ZnSOD mRNA levels were 0.829 +/- 0.048 and 0.621 +/- 0.033, respectively; these data were less than those in the age-matched control group (activity: 8 weeks: P = 0.011, 12 weeks: P = 0.000; mRNA: 8 weeks: P = 0.001, 12 weeks: P = 0.000). The changes of MnSOD occurred as early as 4 weeks after the onset of diabetes, while the changes of the Cu-ZnSOD occurred later, mainly at 8 and 12 weeks after the onset of diabetes.
Apoptosis of the retinal neurons in early diabetic rats may correlate with the decline of the activity and mRNA expression of MnSOD.
A questionnaire on cocaine-use patterns and associated adverse effects on the nasal passages was completed by 464 adolescents. The respondents were abusers of various nonintravenous drugs enrolled in seven modified outpatient treatment facilities for alcohol and other drug abuse in five geographic regions of the country. Three hundred thirty-six respondents (72%) noted that they had used cocaine one or more times prior to their entry into the treatment program. The 336 recovering cocaine users were divided into three groups: those who had used cocaine fewer than 25 times (203 [60%]); those who had used cocaine between 25 and 99 times (107 [32%]); and those who had used the drug daily plus at least 100 times total use of the drug (26 [8%]). Statistically, we found a highly significant difference between the first group and the other two groups for cocaine-associated symptoms, such as frequent sniffing, "sinus" problems, and diminished olfaction. Approximately 30% of those who had "snorted" cocaine at least 25 times but less than daily, vs 47% of those who used the drug daily, recalled that they had nasal membrane irritation with nasal crusts or scabs, recurrent nosebleeds, or both. The astute otolaryngologist should consider cocaine abuse as a cause of puzzling or recalcitrant rhinitis, even during teenage years.
Combination chemotherapy with a regimen of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC) has produced long-term survival times in a significant proportion of patients with advanced nodal and metastatic urothelial tumors. The availability of the colony-stimulating factors has spurred interest in studies evaluating escalated dosing schedules of M-VAC in an attempt to improve major response rates and overall survival. More frequent use of the colony-stimulating factors, however, in this and other settings may be associated with unrecognized side effects. The authors report a case of arterial thrombosis in a 69-year-old man receiving recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and escalated-dose M-VAC for treatment of a transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Incidents of venous thrombosis have been reported previously with the use of colony-stimulating factors, but, to the knowledge of the authors, this case represents the first report of an arterial thrombosis occurring in a patient receiving rhG-CSF.
Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist that rapidly reverses the residual effects of benzodiazepines following intravenous conscious sedation. In a double-blind, multicenter study, postoperative patients who had been sedated with intravenous diazepam were randomly allocated to receive intravenous doses of flumazenil (0.4 mg to 1 mg) or placebo. Levels of sedation and psychomotor impairment were evaluated prestudy, at baseline, and at 6 intervals from 5 to 180 minutes posttreatment. A global evaluation of effectiveness was made at the 5-minute assessment, and memory was assessed at the 180-minute assessment. Flumazenil (mean dose: 0.73 mg [7.3 ml]) was significantly more effective than placebo (mean dose: 8.9 ml) in reversing sedation, psychomotor impairment, and amnesia within 5 minutes after the start of administration. At the 5-minute posttreatment assessment, 84% of 102 flumazenil-treated patients (compared with 42% of 52 placebo-treated patients) experienced complete reversal of sedation. Ninety-two percent of 93 flumazenil-treated patients (compared with 41% of 46 placebo-treated patients) had normal psychomotor function. Reversal of amnesia at the 5-minute assessment was achieved in 75% of 101 flumazenil-treated patients and in 20% of 51 placebo-treated patients. Statistically significant differences between flumazenil and placebo were also observed at the 15-minute assessment. Thereafter there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups. Most (70%) flumazenil-treated patients exhibited no recurrence of sedation during the 180-minute assessment period. The most frequent adverse reaction in the flumazenil group was dizziness (6%). There were no serious adverse experiences related to the test drug. Flumazenil provided prompt, controlled reversal of residual effects, especially sedation, in the majority (84%) of patients recovering from intravenous conscious sedation induced by diazepam. For most (70%) of these flumazenil-treated patients, the reversal was maintained throughout the 180-minute assessment.
Orthostatic hypotension was produced in urethane-anesthetized rabbit by a combination of chlorpromazine (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) and 45 degrees head-up tilt. The effect of midodrine (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.d.) was investigated in comparison with amezinium (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.d.), etilefrine (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.d.) and droxidopa (30 and 100 mg/kg, i.d.). The higher doses of each drug significantly mitigated the chlorpromazine-induced orthostatic hypotension, while none of the lower doses caused a significant effect. The effect of midodrine developed most rapidly; a significant effect was observed 25 min after administration. The order of onset time was midodrine < etilefrine < amezinium < droxidopa. The effect of droxidopa was significant only at 130 to 160 min after administration. The amplitude of effect was in the following order; midodrine = droxidopa > or = etilefrine > amezinium. Midodrine (3 mg/kg, i.d.) mitigated orthostatic hypotension induced by prazosin (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.), but not by pentolinium (0.6 mg/kg, i.v.). It is suggested that midodrine competes with chlorpromazine at alpha1-adrenoceptors and subsequently recovers reflex vasoconstriction. Midodrine may be useful to protect patients with impaired baroreflex activity from accidental orthostatic hypotension during treatment with neuroleptics.
The efficacy and safety of a new benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, were assessed in a double-blind multicenter study. Flumazenil (mean dose, 0.76 mg) or placebo (mean dose, 8.9 ml) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients, respectively, who had been given diazepam in conjunction with an opioid (fentanyl, meperidine, or morphine) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures. The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with flumazenil and 64 patients given placebo. After 5 minutes, 80/115 (70%) flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 21/63 (33%) placebo-treated patients, were completely awake and alert, as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. Ninety-five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5-minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180-minute assessment period. Flumazenil-treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger-to-Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5-minute assessment. Flumazenil was well tolerated, with no serious adverse effects reported. Thirty-nine (30%) of flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 17 (25%) of placebo-treated patients had one or more drug-related adverse experiences. The most common adverse effects were nausea and vomiting in the flumazenil group and nausea and injection-site pain in the placebo group. Flumazenil was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by diazepam in the presence of opioids.
Glutathione S-transferase-micro1, GSTM1, belongs to a superfamily of glutathione S-transferases that metabolizes a broad range of reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics. Across species, genetic variants that result in decreased expression of the Gstm1 gene are associated with increased susceptibility for vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis in humans. We previously identified Gstm1 as a positional candidate in our gene mapping study for susceptibility to renal vascular injury characterized by medial hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the renal vessels. To determine the role of Gstm1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we isolated VSMCs from mouse aortas. We demonstrate that VSMCs from the susceptible C57BL/6 mice have reduced expression of Gstm1 mRNA and its protein product compared with that of the resistant 129 mice. After serum stimulation, C57BL/6 VSMCs proliferate and migrate at a much faster rate than 129 VSMCs. Furthermore, C57BL/6 VSMCs have higher levels of reactive oxygen species and exhibit exaggerated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation after exposure to H(2)O(2). To establish causality, we show that knockdown of Gstm1 by small interfering RNA results in increased proliferation of VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner, as well as in increased reactive oxygen species levels and VSMC migration. Moreover, Gstm1 small interfering RNA causes increased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and attenuates the antiproliferative effect of Tempol. Our data suggest that Gstm1 is a novel regulator of VSMC proliferation and migration through its role in handling reactive oxygen species. Genetic variants that cause a decremental change in expression of Gstm1 may permit an environment of exaggerated oxidative stress, leading to susceptibility to vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis.
The use of doxorubicin, a highly effective antitumor antibiotic, is limited by a dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether chronic exercise training (ET) prior to doxorubicin treatment would preserve cardiac function and reduce myocardial oxidative stress following treatment. Rats were exercise trained on a motorized treadmill or confined to sedentary cage activity for 12 weeks, then administered an intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline. Five days following the injections, hearts were isolated and Langendorf perfused to assess cardiac function and then processed for biochemical analyses. Doxorubicin treatment induced significant inotropic, lusitropic, and chronotropic cardiac dysfunction, reduced coronary flow, and increased cardiac lipid peroxidation in the sedentary animals. Doxorubicin treatment was also associated with a decrease in cardiac manganese superoxide dismutase protein expression and an increase in heat shock protein-72 (Hsp72) compared with saline-treated animals. Exercise training attenuated doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation, and led to a greater cardiac expression of Hsp72 compared with the sedentary animals. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time that chronic exercise training before doxorubicin treatment protects against cardiac dysfunction following treatment, and provide evidence for a sustained increase in myocardial Hsp72 following exercise training and doxorubicin treatment in vivo.
Measurement of plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity and inhibitor-based phenotyping are standard methods for identifying patients who experience post-succinylcholine (SC) apnea attributable to inherited variants of the BChE enzyme. Our aim was to develop PCR-based assays for BCHE mutation detection and implement them for routine diagnostic use at a university teaching hospital.
Between 1999 and 2002, we genotyped 65 patients referred after prolonged post-SC apnea. Five BCHE gene mutations were analyzed. Competitive oligo-priming (COP)-PCR was used for flu-1, flu-2, and K-variant and direct DNA sequencing analysis for dibucaine and sil-1 mutations. Additional DNA sequencing of BCHE coding regions was provided when the five-mutation screen was negative or mutation findings were inconsistent with enzyme activity.
Genotyping identified 52 patients with primary hypocholinesterasemia attributable to BCHE mutations, and in 44 individuals the abnormalities were detected by the five-mutation screen (detection rate, 85%). Additional sequencing studies revealed mutations in eight other patients, including five with novel mutations. The most common genotype abnormality was compound homozygous dibucaine and homozygous K-variant mutations. No simple homozygotes were found. Of the remaining 13 patients, 3 had normal BChE activity and gene, and 10 were diagnosed with hypocholinesterasemia unrelated to BCHE gene abnormalities.
A five-mutation screen for investigation of post-SC apnea identified BCHE gene abnormalities for 80% of a referral population. Six new BCHE mutations were identified by sequencing studies of 16 additional patients.
Ammonia is a bi-product of protein metabolism in the body. It is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and elevated ammonia levels are toxic to the brain. Rats with hyperammonemia showed impaired learning ability and impaired function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (glutamate-NO-cGMP) pathway in the brain. Chronic treatment with sildenafil restored learning ability. We therefore tested the hypothesis that sildenafil has a protective effect on the brains of hyperammonemic rats. Hyperammonemia was induced in male rats by daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ammonium chloride (100 mg/kg body weight) for 8 weeks. Sildenafil citrate was administered intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg body weight/3 days) for 8 weeks. Treatment with sildenafil resulted in a significant reduction in plasma liver enzymes, lipid profile as well as brain lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 mRNA. Meanwhile, plasma NO as well as cGMP, antioxidants and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene expression were significantly elevated in the brains of hyperammonemic rats. Our results showed that sildenafil exerts a protective effect on the brain by reversing oxidative stress during hyperammonemia and this could be due to (i) cytoprotective, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects (ii) increasing cGMP and enhancing the proper metabolism of fats which could suppress oxygen radical generation and thus preventing oxidative damage in the brain. The exact protective mechanism of sildenafil has to be still investigated and further studies are warranted. Consequently, therapeutic modulation of the NO/cGMP pathway might have important clinical applications to improve brain functions in patients with hyperammonemia or clinical hepatic encephalopathy.
Since a car accident a 29-year-old man had been suffering from chronic pain treated with injections of morphine and tilidine. Because of renewed worsening of pain he went to the emergency doctor who by mistake intravenously injected 1 mg of undiluted adrenaline. The patients immediately collapsed and pulmonary oedema developed.
On admission he was hypotensive (85/45 mmHg) and tachycardic (135/min), respiratory rate 36/min. Moist rales were heard throughout the lung. The white cell count was elevated and serum potassium low (3.5 mmol/l). but other routine laboratory tests were unremarkable.
Furosemide, nitroglycerin and morphine were injected at once and his general state improved over the subsequent few hours. Chest radiogram on the next day demonstrated marked reduction of the pulmonary oedema.
To prevent similar, potentially lethal, accidents, before every i.v. injection two persons should check the name of the drug on the label of the vial or bottle, both on drawing up and before injecting the drug.
Inflammasome is a multiprotein complex consisting of Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NALP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and caspase 1 or 5, which functions to switch on the inflammatory process. The present study hypothesized that the formation and activation of NALP3 inflammasomes turn on podocyte injury leading to glomerulosclerosis during hyperhomocysteinemia (hHcys). RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that murine podocytes expressed 3 essential components of the NALP3 inflammasome complex, namely, NALP3, ASC, and caspase 1. Treatment of podocytes with l-homocysteine induced the formation of NALP3 inflammasome complex, an increase in caspase 1 activity, podocyte cytoskeleton rearrangement, and decreased production of vascular endothelial growth factor from podocytes, which were all blocked by silencing the ASC gene or inhibiting caspase 1 activity. In mice with hHcys induced by feeding them a folate-free diet, NALP3 inflammasome formation and activation in glomerular podocytes were detected at an early stage, as shown by confocal microscopy, size exclusion chromatography of the assembled inflammasome complex, and increased interleukin-1β production in glomeruli. Locally silencing the ASC gene in the kidney significantly reduced NALP3 inflammasome formation and interleukin 1β production in glomeruli of mice with hHcys. Pathologically, hHcys-associated albuminuria, foot process effacement of podocytes, loss of podocyte slit diaphragm molecules, and glomerulosclerosis at the late stage were significantly improved by local ASC gene silencing or by caspase 1 inhibition. In conclusion, NALP3 inflammasome formation and activation on stimulation of homocysteine are important molecular mechanisms triggering podocyte injury and ultimately resulting in glomerulosclerosis in hHcys.
Several novel 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-7,7-dimethyl-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-5-oxo-3-(substitutedphenyl)quinazoline derivatives (2-21) structurally similar to prazosin, were prepared using Mannich reaction of 3-(4-chlorophenylamino)-5,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexenone (1) with different aromatic amines in the presence of formaline. The structures of the quinazoline derivatives were established using elemental and spectral analyses. Compounds 18, 20 and 21 were found to possess a high hypotensive effect through their expected α(1)-blocking activity like the clinically used drug prazosin but with advantageous of being did not cause reflex tachycardia and having prolonged duration of action when tested in adrenaline-induced hypertension in anaesthetized rats.
We report two AIDS patients who developed acute renal failure while receiving sulphadiazine for cerebral toxoplasmosis. Renal ultrasound revealed diffuse bilateral echogenic shadowing material. 'Sheaves of wheat' crystals, typical of sulphadiazine crystalluria, were present in the urine. One patient required a percutaneous nephrostomy. Hydration and urine alkalinisation resulted in rapid improvement of renal function and ultrasonographic findings. Sulphadiazine-induced crystalluria and acute renal failure is increasingly frequent. Awareness of its existence may lead to prevention and early conservative treatment.
Nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists have been used for several years as antiparkinsonian drugs. However, there are at least five subtypes of muscarinic receptor (M1-5). Neostriatal M4 receptors have been implicated in aspects of motor function, and it has been suggested that M4 antagonists could be used as treatments for parkinsonism.
Currently, there is a lack of highly selective M4 antagonists that readily penetrate the blood brain barrier. Thus, the present studies focused upon the effects of tropicamide, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist with moderate binding selectivity for the M4 receptor subtype.
Tremulous jaw movements were used as a model of parkinsonian tremor in these studies, and the effects of tropicamide were compared with those of the nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine.
Tropicamide suppressed the tremulous jaw movements induced by the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine and the dopamine antagonist pimozide. Analysis of the dose-response curves indicated that tropicamide showed approximately the same potency as atropine for suppression of pilocarpine-induced jaw movements but was more potent than atropine on the suppression of pimozide-induced jaw movements. In contrast, atropine was more potent than tropicamide in terms of impairing performance on visual stimulus detection and delayed nonmatch-to-position tasks.
These studies demonstrate that tropicamide, which currently is used clinically for ophthalmic purposes, can exert actions that are consistent with antiparkinsonian effects. Moreover, the different pattern of effects shown by tropicamide compared to those of atropine on motor vs cognitive tasks could be due to the modest M4 selectivity shown by tropicamide.
