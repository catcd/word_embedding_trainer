Between 1979 and 1990 we have seen 8 patients (7 females) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed a neuro-muscular involvement while on D-penicillamine (D.P.). Five of them had a drug-induced myasthenia. D.P. withdrawal led to a complete recovery in 1.5 to 5 months. Another patient presented with a myopathy which led to the diagnosis of Grave's disease. She was treated with D.P. for 4 months. D.P. was reintroduced and 5 months later a myasthenic syndrome developed. A thymoma was discovered 1 year later. In the last 2 patients D.P. induced polymyositis which, in one, was associated with features of systemic lupus erythematosus. In the other patient, the evolution was fatal in spite of D.P. withdrawal, high dose steroids and plasma exchanges. A literature survey has shown 150 D.P. induced myasthenia and 38 D.P. induced polymyositis cases.
Two classes of repeated genomic elements, retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses, encode for endogenous nontelomeric reverse transcriptase (RT), a gene that is down-regulated in differentiated cells but is highly expressed in embryonic and transformed tissues. Two nonnucleosidic RT inhibitors, efavirenz and nevirapine, currently used in HIV treatment, reversibly down-regulate tumor growth and induce differentiation in several human tumor cell models.
Aggressive biological behavior and loss of specific thyroid cell functions, such as thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, TSH receptor, Na/I symporter expression, and iodine uptake are features of anaplastic thyroid cancer. Thus, we evaluated the use of RT inhibitors as a potentially differentiating and molecular-targeted treatment of this neoplasm.
Our findings showed that nevirapine and efavirenz reversibly inhibit cell proliferation without triggering cell death in the undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma ARO and FRO cells, which exhibited high levels of endogenous RT activity. Inhibition of cell growth was correlated with accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, with a concomitant decrease in the S phase. Moreover, treated cells demonstrated a differentiated phenotype and a significant reprogramming of gene expression characterized by up-regulation of the TSH receptor, thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, and Na/I symporter genes. Interestingly, RT inhibition reestablished the ability to uptake iodine in response to TSH either in vitro or in vivo and reversibly down-regulated tumor growth in mice xenografts of ARO cells.
These findings support the need for clinical trials to clarify whether RT inhibitors may restore the sensitivity to radiometabolic therapy in anaplastic thyroid tumors.
Cerebral demyelinating disease developed in a patient during adjuvant therapy with levamisole for malignant melanoma. This patient had no evidence of previous neurologic disease. Levamisole was administered for 5 weeks (total dose, 1,500 mg). Over a period of 3 weeks, the patient became progressively confused and ataxic. MRI with gadolinium enhancement demonstrated prominent multifocal enhancing white matter lesions. CSF examination revealed an inflammatory profile. After discontinuation of treatment with levamisole and a short course of corticosteroid therapy, the patient's condition dramatically improved. MRI also indicated improvement. Observations in our patient suggest that the leukoencephalopathy that developed in previously reported patients who received 5-fluorouracil and levamisole may have been caused at least partly by levamisole.
To study the functional contributions of the 5-HT4 receptor subtype of serotonin (5-HT), we have generated knockout mice lacking the 5-HT4 receptor gene. The male mutant mice exhibit a hyposensitivity to anorexic stress. Our recent data indicate that the pharmacological inactivation, using a systemic injection of the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist RS39604 (0.5 mg/kg), suppressed restraint stress-induced anorexia in wild-type female mice. In parallel, the same treatment reduced the 3,4-N-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (" ecstasy", 10 mg/kg)-induced anorexia in male wild-type mice. Our neurochemical analyses suggest that the mechanisms underlying feeding disorders in 5-HT4 receptor knockout mice are related to a lesser efficacy of 5-HT (hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens), leptin and the cocaine-amphetamine related transcript to reduce food intake following stress.
Carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) facilitates the generation of hepatotoxins that can result in morphologic abnormalities, and these abnormalities are reasonably characteristic and reproducible for each particular toxin. It is also known that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) may participate in CCl₄-induced liver injury (CILI). In this study, we observed the chronological changes in circulating soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 and 2 (sTNF-R1 and -R2) in rats with CILI. Laboratory data; circulating levels of TNF-α, sTNF-R1, and sTNF-R2; and TNF-α levels in liver tissues were measured at various time-points. In the CCl₄ group, the plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 7694±3041IU/l)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 3241±2159 IU/l) levels peaked at 48 h after CCl₄ administration, but the other laboratory data did not differ significantly from the corresponding data in the controls. Centrilobular hepatocyte necrosis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells near the central vein area were observed via hematoxylin eosin (HE) and TUNEL staining, respectively, at 24 and 48 h after CCl₄ administration. Compared to the control group, the CCl₄ group did not show significantly the increased circulating TNF-α levels. But TNF-α levels in the liver tissues first peaked at 1h (5261±2253 pg/g liver), and a second peak was observed at 12h (3806±533 pg/g liver) after CCl₄ administration. Compared to the control group, the CCl₄ group showed significantly increased circulating levels of both sTNF-R1 (797±121pg/ml) and sTNF-R2 (5696±626 pg/ml) 1h after CCl₄ administration. Since the hepatocyte apoptosis may be resulted from binding of TNF-α with TNF-R1 at 24h after administration, and consequently the circulating TNF-R2 level might be approximately 10-fold higher than the circulating TNF-R1 level. In conclusion, increased circulating levels of sTNF-R1 and -R2 potentially contribute to drug-induced liver injury, together with AST/ALT.
Two patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders developed varying degrees of paralysis after a single dose of cyclizine, one necessitating full mechanical ventilation. These cases appear to be unique in the literature and represent an increasing spectrum of adverse reactions seen with the greater use of cyclizine.
To investigate the effects of a tissue-specific selective estrogen receptor modulator, idoxifene, on hepatic fibrosis in rats.
Hepatic fibrosis was induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in male rats. The DMN model of hepatic fibrosis and the hepatocytes undergoing oxidative stress were treated with idoxifene respectively. The effect of idoxifene on hepatic fibrosis in the DMN model was examined by immunohistochemistry. Effects of idoxifene on antioxidant enzyme levels of copper, zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), and cellular glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) were measured by ELISA. Effects of idoxifene on activation, proliferation, and apoptosis of culture-activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were analysed by immunohistochemistry, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake, and flow cytometry, respectively.
Idoxifene could markedly suppress DMN-induced hepatic fibrosis in male rats. A treatment of 0.4 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) of idoxifene reduced the protein levels of collagen in the DMN model by 41.19% (P<0.05). Protein level of CuZn-SOD and activitiy of GSHPx in liver treated with DMN plus 0.4 mg/kg/d of idoxifene were 2.65 times (P<0.05) and 2.08 times greater (P<0.05) than that of liver treated with DMN alone respectively. The protein level of CuZn-SOD and activity of GSHPx in cultured rat hepatocytes treated with ferric nitrilotriacetate (FeNTA) plus 1 multiply 10(-7) mol/L of idoxifene were 3.43 times (P<0.05) and 2.52 times (P<0.05) greater than that treated with FeNTA alone. Idoxifene could inhibit HSC activation. Compared with the control, the uptake of BrdU in HSC cultured with 1 multiply 10(-7) mol/L of idoxifene was reduced by 51.87 % (P<0.05), and the number of apoptotic HSCs cultured with 1 multiply 10(-7) mol/L of idoxifene increased by 94.52% (P<0.05).
Idoxifene showed inhibitory action on hepatic fibrosis in male rats.
We have treated 37 patients with intractable pain (35 with cancer-related pain) by continuous intrathecal morphine infusion via implanted pump. These patients were carefully selected according to specific criteria, and each demonstrated a significant reduction in pain following a test dose of intrathecal morphine. All patients had good pain relief from intrathecal morphine infusion, even with pain located in cervical dermatomes. Systemic narcotics could be withdrawn from most patients. Significant side effects were rare and typically self-limited. Many patients required gradually increasing doses, seemingly related to disease progression. Two patients with non-malignant pain have had variable dose requirements over 28 and 44 months without clear tolerance. In these patients we observed a reduction in side effects associated with systemic opioids when continuous intrathecal opioid infusion was instituted. Intrathecal opioid administration may have fewer complications than ablative pain relief procedures. In properly selected patients, this method offers an effective alternative for pain relief.
This study was performed to determine the effects of high doses of two inhaled corticosteroids, beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide, on biochemical indices of bone turnover (urinary hydroxyproline:creatine and calcium:creatinine ratios, plasma alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone). Twelve healthy male doctors, aged 25-36 (mean 30) years, were studied. After a week's run in period eight subjects inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate 2000 micrograms/day and eight inhaled budesonide 1800 micrograms/day for 28 days; this was followed by a week without any treatment. During treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate there was a significant increase in the hydroxyproline:creatinine ratio (a 46% increase at 28 days), and a fall in serum alkaline phosphatase activity (a 7.4% fall at 28 days). There were no significant changes during budesonide treatment. Thus high dose inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate increased biochemical markers of bone resorption and reduced serum alkaline phosphatase, a marker of bone mineralisation. A prospective study in asthmatic patients is indicated to assess the long term effects of high dose inhaled corticosteroids on bone mass.
Amiodarone (AMD), a class III antiarrhythmic drug, causes idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in human patients. We demonstrated previously that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) plays an important role in a rat model of AMD-induced hepatotoxicity under inflammatory stress. In this study, we developed a model in vitro to study the roles of caspase activation and oxidative stress in TNF potentiation of AMD cytotoxicity. AMD caused cell death in Hepa1c1c7 cells, and TNF cotreatment potentiated its toxicity. Activation of caspases 9 and 3/7 was observed in AMD/TNF-cotreated cells, and caspase inhibitors provided minor protection from cytotoxicity. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation were observed after treatment with AMD and were further elevated by TNF cotreatment. Adding water-soluble antioxidants (trolox, N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, or ascorbate) produced only minor attenuation of AMD/TNF-induced cytotoxicity and did not influence the effect of AMD alone. On the other hand, α-tocopherol (TOCO), which reduced lipid peroxidation and ROS generation, prevented AMD toxicity and caused pronounced reduction in cytotoxicity from AMD/TNF cotreatment. α-TOCO plus a pancaspase inhibitor completely abolished AMD/TNF-induced cytotoxicity. In summary, activation of caspases and oxidative stress were observed after AMD/TNF cotreatment, and caspase inhibitors and a lipid-soluble free-radical scavenger attenuated AMD/TNF-induced cytotoxicity.
With the increase in jogging and distance running as a means of attaining and maintaining fitness, and in the light of the difficulty in advising certain groups of patients about their capacity for such exercise, we report on several potentially avoidable factors in the death of a 45 year old Sheffield Marathon runner in June 1983.
NS-718, a lipid nanosphere incorporating amphotericin B, is effective against pathogenic fungi and has low toxicity. We compared the toxicity of NS-718 with that of Fungizone (amphotericin B-sodium deoxycholate; D-AmB) in vitro using renal cell cultures and in vivo by biochemical analysis, histopathological study of the kidney and pharmacokinetic study of amphotericin B following intravenous infusion of the formulation in rats. Incubation with NS-718 resulted in significantly less damage of cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells compared with D-AmB. Serum blood urea and creatinine concentrations increased significantly in rats given an iv infusion of D-AmB 3 mg/kg but not in those given the same dose of NS-718. Histopathological examination of the kidney showed tubular necrosis in D-AmB-treated rats but no change in NS-718-treated rats. Amphotericin B concentrations in the kidney in NS-718-treated rats were higher than those in D-AmB-treated rats. Our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that incorporation of amphotericin B into lipid nanospheres of NS-718 attenuates the nephrotoxicity of amphotericin B.
Following changes in the safety information on the use of risperidone and olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia, data from prescription-event monitoring (PEM) studies of risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine were examined. The aim was to compare incidence rates for events reported as cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) during the first 180 days of treatment in patients prescribed atypical antipsychotics for dementia or other indications, because of the possible association between dementia and stroke in users of atypical antipsychotics. A retrospective analysis of data from the three observational studies was conducted using Poisson regression modelling and survival analysis. Within the risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine cohorts, 23 (0.30%), 6 (0.35%) and 10 (0.11%) patients respectively, were reported to have had a CVA/TIA event. Age, sex and indication (dementia or other) were identified as important confounding variables; age being the most important. The crude rate ratios (RRs) for CVA/TIA for risperidone or quetiapine vs. olanzapine indicated an approximate threefold relative difference in rate during the first six months but after adjustment for age, sex and indication, the RRs were non-significant (1.2 (95% CI 0.5,3.0) and 2.1 (95% CI 0.6,7.7), respectively). For risperidone vs. quetiapine, crude and adjusted RRs were not significantly different. Of the three drugs, the time to event was shortest for risperidone and also shortest for risperidone or quetiapine users where the indication was dementia. The age and sex adjusted RR of CVA/TIA in patients prescribed risperidone for dementia vs. other indications was 6.7 (95% CI 2.4,18.9). The adjusted RRs for quetiapine, according to indication, could not be calculated due to missing information on age and sex. There were no cases of CVA/TIA with dementia for olanzapine, thus the RRs and time to event curves according to indication could not be examined. This study revealed no significant difference in the adjusted RR of CVA/TIA events in the first 180 days of treatment in patients prescribed risperidone or quetiapine when compared with olanzapine. However, dementia appears to be an important risk factor. These results should be considered alongside other pharmacoepidemiological studies on this topic.
The addition of cytokines to chemotherapy (CT) has obtained encouraging but contradictory results in metastatic melanoma. In this phase III trial, we compared the effects of CT [cisplatin, vindesine and dacarbazine (CVD)] with those of concurrent biochemotherapy (bioCT) consisting of CVD plus interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha2b.
A total of 151 untreated metastatic melanoma patients were randomized, 75 on arm A (cisplatin 30 mg/m2 on days 1-3, vindesine 2.5 mg/m2 on day 1 and dacarbazine 250 mg/m2 on days 1-3), and 76 on arm B (same CVD scheme plus interferon-alpha2b on days 1-5 and interleukin-2 on days 1-5 and 8-15, both administered subcutaneously), either recycled every 3 weeks. Response was assessed every two cycles.
Ten percent of the patients were alive at a median of 52 months from start of therapy. We observed a response rate (RR) of 21% on arm A versus 33% on arm B; three patients (4%) given bioCT had complete responses (CRs). Median time to progression (TTP) was identical; median overall survival (OS) time was 12 months on arm A and 11 months on arm B.
BioCT is not better than CT alone; the trend in favor of the bioCT in terms of RR did not translate into better TTP or OS. Therefore, bioCT cannot be recommended as standard first-line therapy for metastatic melanoma.
Of 15 patients with psychiatric reactions to lidocaine, 12 (80%) had mood changes, 11 (73%) had "doom anxiety," eight (53%) had overt confusional states, and six (40%) had hallucinations and delusions. The authors contend that morbid fears of impending doom or the belief that death has occurred are specific manifestations of lidocaine toxicity and may be mistakenly attributed to "understandable" fears about death during the course of recovery from a myocardial infarction on the coronary care unit.
We investigated the contribution of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to the pathogenesis of diastolic heart failure (DHF) in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) hypertensive rats, with the aim of testing our hypothesis that the cardioprotective effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) blockade are provided by the suppression of this pathway.
DS rats were maintained on high (H: 8.0% NaCl) or low (L: 0.3% NaCl) salt diets from age 7 to 17 weeks. DS/H rats were also treated with candesartan cilexetil (10 mg/kg per day, orally) or a superoxide dismutase mimetic, tempol (3 mmol/l in drinking water) from age 7 to 17 weeks.
DS/H rats represented hypertension, left ventricular (LV) relaxation abnormality and myocardial stiffening with preserved systolic heart function. As compared with DS/L rats, DS/H rats showed higher levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), p22phox and gp91phox mRNA expression, NADPH oxidase activity and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) contents in LV tissues. Gene expression of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2), an inner mitochondrial membrane proton transporter, was also 2.8 +/- 0.5-fold higher. In DS/H rats, treatment with candesartan did not alter blood pressure, but resulted in a marked improvement of the hemodynamic deterioration; these therapeutic effects were accompanied by decreases in myocardial NADPH oxidase activity, TBARS contents and the expression of TGF-beta, CTGF, p22phox, gp91phox and UCP-2. Similar therapeutic effects were provided by treatment with tempol in DS/H rats.
Our data suggest that NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production contributes to the pathogenesis of DHF in DS hypertensive rats, and that the cardioprotective effects of AngII blockade are, at least partially, mediated through the suppression of this pathway.
The differential anticarcinogenic activity of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers, including c9,t11-CLA, t10,c12-CLA, and t,t-CLA, was examined in a mouse forestomach carcinogenesis regimen induced by benzo(a)pyrene (BP). Female ICR mice (6-7 weeks of age, 26 +/- 1 g) were divided into six groups (30 mice/group, 5 mice/cage): control, linoleic acid, CLA, c9,t11-CLA, t10,c12-CLA, and t,t-CLA. Each mouse was orally given 0.1 mL of sample and 0.1 mL of olive oil on Monday and Wednesday and BP (2 mg in 0.2 mL of olive oil) on Friday. This cycle was repeated four times. Twenty-three weeks later, the experiment was terminated for tumor analysis. t,t-CLA significantly reduced (p < 0.05) both tumor number and tumor size per mouse, relative to CLA and c9,t11-CLA, but similar to t10,c12-CLA. Reduction in tumor incidence by t,t-CLA (84.6%) was similar to that by CLA, c9,t11-CLA, and t10,c12-CLA, but it was significantly reduced (p < 0.05), relative to 100% linoleic acid and control. t,t-CLA elevated the apoptotic index to 35%, relative to 23% for CLA, 21% for c9,t11-CLA, 29% for t10,c12-CLA, 7% for linoleic acid, and 4% for control. t,t-CLA up-regulated the expression of the Bax gene and activated caspase-3 enzymes but down-regulated expression of the Bcl-2 gene. Cytosolic phospholipase A(2) activity was not affected by the CLA isomers tested. These results suggest that t,t-CLA has superior anticarcinogenic potential on BP-induced mouse forestomach neoplasia to CLA, c9,t11-CLA, and t10,c12-CLA, via the induction of apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction.
The cardiovascular toxicity of cocaine is complex because it has local anesthetic properties, central nervous system stimulatory effects, as well as cardiac effects. Recreational use of this drug has increased recently, but the precise mechanism of sudden cardiac death induced by cocaine is not known. The primary objective of this work was to test for a direct cardiovascular toxicity of cocaine. Rats and rabbits were anesthetized, and the femoral vein and artery were cannulated for drug infusion and blood pressure monitoring. Different doses of cocaine (0.3, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg) were infused. For conscious animal experiments, the animals were allowed to recover from the anesthesia and then were subjected to cocaine. Low doses of cocaine (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) increased systolic as well as diastolic pressure in conscious rats and rabbits. In anesthetized rats and rabbits, the same dose of cocaine increased blood pressure with a decrease in heart rate. With the high doses of cocaine (3 and 10 mg/kg), all cardiac parameters were reduced in both rats and rabbits. In isolated rabbit hearts, cocaine decreased all cardiac parameters. Based on the fact that high doses of cocaine severely depressed all cardiac parameters and its effect on the isolated heart, cocaine-induced sudden cardiac death appears to be due to a primary effect on the myocardium.
The H6 homeobox genes Hmx1, Hmx2, and Hmx3 (also known as Nkx5-3; Nkx5-2 and Nkx5-1, respectively), compose a family within the NKL subclass of the ANTP class of homeobox genes. Hmx gene family expression is mostly limited to sensory organs, branchial (pharyngeal) arches, and the rostral part of the central nervous system. Targeted mutation of either Hmx2 or Hmx3 in mice disrupts the vestibular system. These tandemly duplicated genes have functional overlap as indicated by the loss of the entire vestibular system in double mutants. Mutants have not been described for Hmx1, the most divergent of the family.
Dumbo (dmbo) is a semi-lethal mouse mutation that was recovered in a forward genetic mutagenesis screen. Mutants exhibit enlarged ear pinnae with a distinctive ventrolateral shift. Here, we report on the basis of this phenotype and other abnormalities in the mutant, and identify the causative mutation as being an allele of Hmx1. Examination of dumbo skulls revealed only subtle changes in cranial bone morphology, namely hyperplasia of the gonial bone and irregularities along the caudal border of the squamous temporal bone. Other nearby otic structures were unaffected. The semilethality of dmbo/dmbo mice was found to be ~40%, occured perinatally, and was associated with exencephaly. Surviving mutants of both sexes exhibited reduced body mass from ~3 days postpartum onwards. Most dumbo adults were microphthalmic. Recombinant animals and specific deletion-bearing mice were used to map the dumbo mutation to a 1.8 Mb region on Chromosome 5. DNA sequencing of genes in this region revealed a nonsense mutation in the first exon of H6 Homeobox 1 (Hmx1; also Nkx5-3). An independent spontaneous allele called misplaced ears (mpe) was also identified, confirming Hmx1 as the responsible mutant gene.
The divergence of Hmx1 from its paralogs is reflected by different and diverse developmental roles exclusive of vestibular involvement. Additionally, these mutant Hmx1 alleles represent the first mouse models of a recently-discovered Oculo-Auricular syndrome caused by mutation of the orthologous human gene.
Repeated finger tremor measurements have been performed in six normal and eight asthmatic subjects after subcutaneous and oral administration of terbutaline. Prior to the investigations the patients had not used bronchodilators for 10-14 days. The finger tremor pattern showed a striking parallelism with the terbutaline serum concentrations and with the cAMP plasma levels. After subcutaneous administration the increase in tremor values in asthmatic subjects was significantly less than in normals. This suggests a beta-blockade in skeletal muscle of asthmatics. The difference after oral administration was not statistically significant.
Clinical experience with triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog) injections into the nasal turbinates for allergic and vasomotor rhinitis is reported by two authors. Gratifying results have occurred in most of the over 60,000 patients treated, with no serious side effects. Two cases of intravascular injections of another corticosteroid reaching the retinal circulation are reported, and methods for preventing this complication are proposed.
In utero exposure to valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, causes neural tube, heart, and limb defects. Valpromide (VPD), the amide derivative of VPA, does not inhibit HDAC activity and is a weak teratogen in vivo. The detailed mechanism of action of VPA as a teratogen is not known. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that VPA disrupts regulation of the expression of genes that are critical in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis during limb development. Murine gestation day-12 embryonic forelimbs were excised and exposed to VPA or VPD in a limb bud culture system. VPA caused a significant concentration- dependent increase in limb abnormalities, which was correlated with its HDAC inhibitory effect. The signaling of both Sox9 and Runx2, key regulators of chondrogenesis, was downregulated by VPA. In contrast, VPD had little effect on limb morphology and no significant effect on HDAC activity or the expression of marker genes. Thus, VPA exposure dysregulated the expression of target genes directly involved in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in the developing limb. Disturbances in these signaling pathways are likely to be a consequence of HDAC inhibition because VPD did not affect their expressions.
