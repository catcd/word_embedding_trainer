The induction of dominant cataract mutations by procarbazine was studied concomitantly with the induction of specific-locus mutations in treated male mice. The most effective dose in the specific-locus test, 600 mg/kg of procarbazine, and a fractionated dose of 5 X 200 mg/kg were used. The frequencies of dominant cataract mutations were higher, but not significantly different from the historical control. The ratio between the number of recovered specific-locus and dominant cataract mutations was in accordance with that found in our experiments with gamma-rays (Ehling et al., 1982; Kratochvilova, 1981) or in experiments with ethylnitrosourea (Favor, 1986). A total of 3 dominant cataract mutations were recovered in the offspring of procarbazine-treated spermatogonial stem cells. Two mutations had complete penetrance while the third exhibited a reduced penetrance of approximately 70%. The viability and fertility of the heterozygotes of all 3 mutations were not affected. Only 1 mutation was shown to be viable as a homozygote.
Not all arteritides of the temporal arteries are giant cell temporal arteritis (Horton's disease). We describe an unusual case of etodolac (Lodine) nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) induced hypersensitivity vasculitis of the temporal artery clinically simulating giant cell temporal arteritis. NSAID are common drugs and their gastrointestinal and renal side effects are well known. Ours is the first known documentation of NSAID induced hypersensitivity vasculitis isolated to the involvement of a temporal artery.
The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children was applied to 64 epileptic children and 60 healthy subjects; patients followed chronic treatment with valproic acid (n = 32) or phenobarbital (n = 32). None of the children suffered mental retardation or neurological abnormalities. The test was repeated after a 9-12 month interval: 26 of the valproate treated children and 23 of the phenobarbital-treated children performed the second evaluation. At baseline, total, verbal and performance IQ scores of children receiving phenobarbital were lower than those of controls. When the results of the first and the second tests were compared, a significant increase in IQ scores was detected among controls and patients treated with valproic acid, but not among phenobarbital-treated patients. It is concluded that long-term phenobarbital therapy induces a significant impairment in learning ability whereas long-term valproate therapy does not exert a noticeable noxious effect at this respect.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represents the main target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy, as its overexpression or constitutive activation contributes to malignancy and correlates with poor prognosis. Our previous work demonstrated that in epithelial cells β1 integrin is required for propagating EGFR signaling from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. In this study, we silenced β1 integrin in human NSCLC A549 cells. The β1 integrin-silenced cells show a defective activation of the EGFR signaling cascade, leading to decreased in vitro proliferation, enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin and Gefitinib, impaired migration and invasive behavior. Inhibitory effects on tumor growth and on the EGFR pathway were also observed in in vivo experiments. Moreover, β1 integrin silencing increases the amount of EGFR on the cell surface, suggesting that β1 integrin is required for efficient constitutive EGFR turnover at the cell membrane. Although the rate of EGF internalization and recycling is not affected in silenced cells, EGFR signaling is recovered only by expression of the Rab-coupling protein RCP, indicating that β1 integrin sustains the endocytic machinery required for EGFR signaling. Overall, these results show that β1 integrin is an essential regulator of EGFR signaling and tumorigenic properties of lung cancer cells, and that its silencing might represent an adjuvant approach to anti-EGFR therapy.
In a poisonous incident in Kamisu, Japan, it is understood that diphenylarsinic acid (DPAA) was a critical contaminant of ground water. Most patients showed dysfunction of the central nervous system. To understand the overall mechanism of DPAA toxicity and to gain some insight into the application of a remedy specific for intoxication, the molecular target must be clarified. As an approach, a high throughput analysis of cell proteins in cultured human hepatocarcinoma HpG2 exposed to DPAA was performed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Four proteins, which were up- and down-regulated by exposure of cultured HepG2 cells to DPAA, were identified. They were chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) beta subunit, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), ribosomal protein P0 and glutaminase C (GAC). Of these, GAC was the only protein that was down-regulated by DPAA exposure, and cellular expression levels were reduced by DPAA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Decrease in cellular GAC levels was accompanied by decreased activity of the enzyme, phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG). Decreased expression of GAC by DPAA was also observed in human cervical carcinoma HeLa and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. By contrast, no significant changes in GAC protein expression were observed when cells were incubated with arsenite [iAs (III)] and trivalent dimethylarsinous acid [DMA (III)]. In the central nervous system, GAC plays a role in the production of the neurotransmitter glutamic acid. Selective inhibition of GAC expression by DPAA may be a cause of dysfunction of glutamatergic neuronal transmission and the resultant neurological impairments.
Electrophysiologic properties of various conduction pathways responsible for preexcitation syndrome are illdefined; they explain the incidence of arrhythmias : supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and, in much rarer cases, flutter. The site of Verapamil activity is chiefly the atrioventricular junction, while its action on the refractory period of atrio-ventricular bypass is small and unforeseable. In a patient with type B. W.P.W. syndrome, complicated with atrial flutter Verapamil induced a preferential stimulation through the anomalous pathway. Right BBB which was obvious during the attack of atrial flutter, was hidden by the type B W.P.W. syndrome, the right branch being shunted by the anomalous pathway. The infrequency of atrial flutter in type B W.P.W. syndrome is emphasized.
Recent studies in animal models have demonstrated that in contrast with humans, cephalothin (CTIN) does not increase gentamicin (GENT) nephrotoxicity, but rather protects against it, particularly when CTIN is given simultaneously with GENT. To investigate this phenomenon in humans a study was designed in which 67 patients suffering from mild infections were investigated. Thirty-three of them served as the control group receiving GENT alone at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/8 hourly, while the remaining 34 received CTIN at a dose of 2 g or 3 g 8 hourly by i.v. bolus, either simultaneously with GENT or separated by a 4-h interval. Findings showed that: (a) cylindruria developed in 66.6% and 82.3% and 82.3% in the GENT and GENT + CTIN groups respectively, (b) urinary beta-glycuronidase activity increased in 57.5% and 75% (c) serum creatinine exceeded by 0.3 mg the initial values in 21.2% and 27.6% and (d) the blood urea was above 50 mg% in 18.1% and 17.6% of the patients. These results indicate that: (a) regardless of the route and order of administration simultaneous treatment did not protect against nephrotoxicity in humans; (b) the combination of GENTA plus CTIN has no synergistic effect on the production of elevated serum creatinine and rising blood urea; (c) urinary beta-glycuronidase is not a significant predictor of eventual nephrotoxicity; (d) the following risk factors influenced the appearance of nephrotoxicity in both groups: (1) elevated GENT trough levels greater than or equal to 2 mg/l; (2) a course of treatment longer than 10 days.
Two girls, aged 2 and 4 years, with acute gastroenteritis and vomiting, received domperidone and metoclopramide, respectively. Urinary retention developed, but after catheterisation of the bladder was performed once and the medication was withdrawn, both children recovered without further sequelae. Anti-dopaminergic antiemetic agents should be prescribed with caution, especially in young children.
Cytokines are reported to be associated with the formation of prostate cancer. Our aim was to investigate whether C/T polymorphisms of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene and IL-2 receptor beta (IL-2RB) gene are associated with prostate cancer. We compared the frequency of the polymorphisms of the IL-2 gene and the IL-2RB gene between 96 patients with prostate cancer and 105 healthy male volunteers from the same area (age >60 years). They were followed for at least 5 years. There was a significant difference in distribution of the genotype of the IL-2 gene polymorphism between the prostate cancer group and the control group (P = 0.017). The distribution of the TT homozygote of the IL-2 gene was significantly higher in the cancer group (32.3%) than in the control group (16.2%). However, no significant statistical difference was found between the polymorphism of the IL-2 gene and prostate cancer in survival analysis during a 5-year follow up period (log rank test; P = 0.19). There was no significant difference in the distribution of the genotype of the IL-2RB gene polymorphism between controls and cancer patients (P = 0.388). This study suggests that the IL-2 gene may be associated with susceptibility to prostate cancer in the Taiwan population.
We report a case of sulphasalazine-related drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (the "three-week sulphasalazine syndrome") in which periferal T-cell lymphoma was a provisory diagnosis. A 40-year-old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to a local hospital 26 days after initiation of sulphasalazine treatment. She had fever, lymphadenopathy, dermatitis and facial oedema and showed biochemical signs of progressive hepatitis. Peripheral blood counts showed elevated leucocyte count with 15% atypical plasmacytes. Lymph node biopsy showed altered follicular architecture, a diffuse CD 4 positive predominance and histiocytes with erythrophagocytosis. Investigation by gene rearrangement for clonality of B- and T-lymphocytes ruled out the suspicion of lymphoma. Haematological and near-fatal hepatological changes resolved following discontinuation of sulphasalazine and a three-week course of glucocorticoid therapy. Early awareness of this syndrome via measuring liver function tests on, e.g., days 14-35 in patients started on sulphasalazine is recommended.
A healthy 31-year-old male abstinent from drug abuse during his recent incarceration developed slurred speech, a severe headache, and left-sided hemiparesis prior to his eventual death 9.5 hours after inhalation of methamphetamine. On postmortem examination, inspection of the brain revealed bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, with a prominent intralobar hemorrhage centered within the right frontal cerebral hemisphere. No evidence of vasculitis, infarction, intraventricular hemorrhage, or ruptured aneurysm could be observed. While this is not the first report of a methamphetamine-related stroke, this report describes the autopsy findings of an intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to methamphetamine abuse on autopsy and compares the findings and antemortem history to previously reported methamphetamine cerebral vascular deaths.
Intrastriatal transplantation of fetal ventral mesencephalon (VM) tissue provides the potential to alleviate motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). However, the degree of recovery varies among individuals with an incidence of "off-phase", graft-induced dyskinesia (GID) in some patients. We hypothesised that this variability is due to the heterogeneous nature of dopaminergic neurons in the transplant. We therefore investigated this in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of PD. These animals were primed to develop LID and then transplanted with fetal VM into the caudal aspects of the striatum. No GID was observed but in a significant number of animals the transplants ameliorated LID. There was a correlation between the degree of behavioural and LID recovery with the number of A9 dopaminergic neurons in the transplant, based on their expression of a G-protein-coupled inward rectifying current potassium channel (Girk2). Furthermore, we showed that LID development is related to an abnormal expression profile of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) in the striatum and that intrastriatal VM transplants normalised both Cdk5 expression and DARPP-32 phosphorylation in animals exhibiting functional improvement. These results suggest that an A9 dopaminergic neuron-enriched transplant may be the key to an effective PD cell replacement therapy through normalisation of the altered striatal expression of Cdk5/DARPP-32.
TNF is a pleotropic cytokine known to be involved in the progression of several pro-inflammatory disorders. Many therapeutic agents have been designed to counteract the effect of TNF in rheumatoid arthritis as well as a number of cancers. In the present study we have synthesized and evaluated the anti-cancer activity of novel biscoumarins in vitro and in vivo. Among new compounds, BIHC was found to be the most cytotoxic agent against the HepG2 cell line while exhibiting less toxicity toward normal hepatocytes. Furthermore, BIHC inhibited the proliferation of various hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Subsequently, using in silico target prediction, BIHC was predicted as a TNF blocker. Experimental validation was able to confirm this hypothesis, where BIHC could significantly inhibit the recombinant mouse TNF-α binding to its antibody with an IC50 of 16.5 μM. Furthermore, in silico docking suggested a binding mode of BIHC similar to a ligand known to disrupt the native, trimeric structure of TNF, and also validated with molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, we have demonstrated the down-regulation of p65 phosphorylation and other NF-κB-regulated gene products upon BIHC treatment, and on the phenotypic level the compound shows inhibition of CXCL12-induced invasion of HepG2 cells. Also, we demonstrate that BIHC inhibits infiltration of macrophages to the peritoneal cavity and suppresses the activity of TNF-α in vivo in mice primed with thioglycollate broth and lipopolysaccharide. We comprehensively validated the TNF-α inhibitory efficacy of BIHC in an inflammatory bowel disease mice model.
Information from a comprehensive drug surveillance programme has been reviewed to give details of the frequency of drug-related hypo- and hyperkalaemia in a group of 3879 patients admitted to hospital with cardiac failure. Hypokalaemia was commoner in females, was unrelated to blood area concentration on admission and was twice as common amongst recipients of potassium-losing diuretics who did not take potassium supplements than amongst those who received potassium retaining diuretics. By contrast hyperkalaemia was strongly related to blood urea concentration on admission. It was also related to in-hospital diuretic therapy; being thrice as frequent amongst recipients of aldosterone antagonists than amongst those receiving potassium-losing diuretics without additional supplements. Life-threatening hypo- and hyper-kalaemia were rare in this group of patients with heart failure, occurring with approximately equal frequencies of about 2 per 1000 patients treated.
Intake of salt and salty food is known as a risk factor for gastric carcinogenesis. To examine the dose-dependence and the mechanisms underlying enhancing effects, Mongolian gerbils were treated with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), Helicobacter pylori and food containing various concentrations of salt, and were sacrificed after 50 weeks. Among gerbils treated with MNU and H. pylori, the incidences of glandular stomach cancers were 15% in the normal diet group and 33%, 36% and 63% in the 2.5%, 5% and 10% NaCl diet groups, showing dose-dependent increase (p < 0.01). Intermittent intragastric injection of saturated NaCl solution, in contrast, did not promote gastric carcinogenesis. In gerbils infected with H. pylori, a high salt diet was associated with elevation of anti-H. pylori antibody titers, serum gastrin levels and inflammatory cell infiltration in a dose-dependent fashion. Ten percent NaCl diet upregulated the amount of surface mucous cell mucin (p < 0.05), suitable for H. pylori colonization, despite no increment of MUC5AC mRNA, while H. pylori infection itself had an opposing effect, stimulating transcription of MUC6 and increasing the amount of gland mucous cell mucin (GMCM). High salt diet, in turn, decreased the amount of GMCM, which acts against H. pylori infection. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated dose-dependent enhancing effects of salt in gastric chemical carcinogenesis in H. pylori-infected Mongolian gerbils associated with alteration of the mucous microenvironment. Reduction of salt intake could thus be one of the most important chemopreventive methods for human gastric carcinogenesis.
To discuss two cases of life-threatening serotonin toxicity due to a drug interaction between citalopram and fluconazole and to review the pertinent literature.
A Medline search without date limitation was conducted using the terms serotonin syndrome, serotonin toxicity, fluconazole and citalopram.
Fluconazole inhibits CYP2C19. Citalopram is a substrate for 2C19 and inhibition of its metabolism may result in serotonin toxicity. Serotonin toxicity in oncology patients may not present with the classic constellation of signs typically described in the literature. Delirium may be the only presenting feature. Current level of evidence for treatment of serotonin toxicity is level 4 or 5 (case series and expert opinion). Nevertheless, there is a strong theoretical basis for treating serotonin toxicity in medical patients with a 5H(2A) blocker such as cyproheptadine.
Consultation-liaison psychiatrists and oncologists should be aware of this preventable and underrecognized interaction. Citalopram should be stopped or substituted prior to the concurrent administration of fluconazole, and in the event of toxicity, treatment with cyproheptadine has a favorable risk-benefit ratio despite a lack of randomized controlled data to support its use.
The antihypertensive, saluretic and hypokalaemic effects of a small dose of cyclothiazide (2.5 mg daily) were compared with those of a conventional dose of an hydrochlorthiazide-amiloride hydrochloride combination (50 + 5 mg daily). Both preparations were given to 13 patients with mild (WHO I) hypertension in a cross-over manner for six weeks, with an intervening wash-out phase of three weeks. The antihypertensive efficacy of cyclothiazide was well comparable to that of the hydrochlorthiazide-amiloride combination, although cyclothiazide tended to inhibit renal sodium reabsorption less than the combination. Cyclothiazide tended to cause hypokalaemia, apparently due to increased potassium loss, but with the present dosage none of the 13 patients developed marked hypokalaemia (serum potassium less than 3.3 mmol/l). Both drugs led to a comparable increase in serum urate concentration. Neither of the preparations affected creatinine or free-water clearance. The results suggest that even in relatively small doses thiazides effectively decrease blood pressure, and combining thiazides with potassium-sparing diuretics is advantageous only in patients with marked hypokalaemia and its associated risks.
To raise awareness of a rare but serious adverse effect of a commonly used medication.
Report of a case.
A previously healthy 42-year-old woman presented with acute-onset delirium with psychotic features as a consequence of levofloxacin therapy. Withdrawal of the medication was associated with return of the patient's normal mental status.
The new quinolone derivatives (levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin), also called gyrase inhibitors, are known for their potential to cause central nervous system-related adverse effects, including headache, dizziness and insomnia. Risk factors for neurotoxicity include renal insufficiency, underlying central nervous system (CNS) disease and increased CNS penetration of drug. Acute delirium resulting from levofloxacin therapy is an exceedingly rare complication that has been thought to occur more commonly in elderly patients. Here, we describe levofloxacin-induced delirium with psychotic features in a relatively young, otherwise healthy female.
Three hundred and forty eight critically-ill patients with a documented Gram-negative infection were randomized to receive amikacin once- (od) or twice-daily (bd). The amikacin was given by slow intravenous injection in a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in patients under the age of one year (paediatric group) and 15 mg/kg in patients over the age of one year (adult group). Paediatric and adult patients on the od regimen received a loading dose of 25 and 20 mg/kg respectively. The dosages were subsequently adjusted to achieve desirable blood levels. Patients received other antibiotics as clinically indicated. Forty-eight patients were withdrawn from the study due to death or azotaemia occurring in the first 72 h. One hundred and fifty five patients (76 paediatric) received an od dose and 145 (65 paediatric) received a bd dose. The clinical cure rate was 83% in the od group compared to 66% in the bd group (P = 0.001). The bacteriological cure rate was 81% in the od group compared to 58% in the bd group (P = 0.005). In the paediatric sub-group the cure rate was higher with the od regimen (P = 0.002) but this difference was not statistically significant in the adult patients (P = 0.1). The serum creatinine rose in 35% of patients in the bd group compared to 21% in the od group (P = 0.05). Although audiometry was not performed there was no clinical evidence of ototoxicity in any of the patients. In conclusion od amikacin dosing resulted in a higher cure and less nephrotoxicity than conventional bd dosing.
Hyperprolactinemia is a well-recognized side effect of antipsychotic treatment. Cabergoline, a dopamine agonist, has been introduced on the market to treat hyperprolactinemia, even secondary to antipsychotic use.
In this article, we described two schizophrenic patients who received cabergoline to treat their antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia and developed a subsequent psychotic exacerbation. The first patient received amisulpride as antipsychotic medication, and the second one took risperidone and fluoxetine for her psychotic and depressive symptoms, respectively. Both patients improved significantly their psychotic symptoms in 1 week without changing their former antipsychotic regimens.
To the best of our knowledge, we found no previous report of cabergoline-induced psychotic exacerbation in schizophrenic patients who received antipsychotics. We brought up questions whether schizophrenic patients on amisulpride or with the addition of fluoxetine may have higher risk to experience psychotic worsening. We also highlighted the possible role of dose-dependent nature in cabergoline-induced psychotic exacerbation, suggesting that the single starting dose of 0.5 mg or higher might be unsafe in schizophrenic patients.
These cases suggest that cabergoline, like other dopaminergic agents, should be used with caution in psychotic patients and the dose should be as low as possible.
This study was carried out to compare the hematological effects of 2-methoxyethanol (ME), 2-ethoxyethanol (EE), 2-isopropoxyethanol (IPE), and 2-butoxyethanol (BE) in short-term studies in rats. Male rats were subcutaneously treated with ME or EE at a dosage of 0, 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 mM/kg in saline, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Other rats were exposed to IPE or BE at doses of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.25 mM/kg in the same manner. Administration of each chemical, except of ME, resulted in a time- and dose-dependent swelling of erythrocytes as evidenced by an increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Subsequently, red blood cells (RBC), packed cell volumes (PCV), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) decreased. Furthermore, an increase in mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) and reticulocyte counts was observed. The onset of hemolysis induced by EE, IPE or BE was faster than after ME administration. While in rats exposed to ME hematological changes were strongly pronounced and progressively increased with exposure time beginning from the day 11, those in animals treated with EE were rather persisted at low constant level for all exposure period. In contrast, the rats exposed to IPE and BE demonstrated the dramatic hematological changes more pronounced in case of BE than IPE at the beginning of exposure (on day 4). Despite of exposure duration, these changes were regressed, although the decrease in RBC and MCHC and the increase in MCV and MCH in rats treated with highest doses of both compound (0.5, 0.75, and 1.25 mM/kg) were more persistent, probably due to selective hemolysis of the aged erythrocytes. In addition, significant leukopenia due to reduction of lymphocytes in rats exposed to ME was observed. In summary, this study demonstrated no tolerance to ME- and EE-induced intravascular hemolysis developed under these experimental conditions. On the contrary, tolerance to IPE- and BE-induced hemolysis in rats exposed to these compounds was prompted.
We report a 66 years old male, with an ophtalmologic history of long sightedness, admitted to the hospital due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation crises in the context of a coronary heart disease. He was treated with i.v. amiodarone, receiving a total dose of 6 g in 72 hours. After the third day of treatment, the patient noticed a correction of his long sightedness and 24 h later, he complained of hlurred vision and orbital frontal headache. Visual field examination revealed a concentric retraction of visual field and a centrocecal scotoma in both eyes. Amiodarone was withdrawn and dexametasone treatment was begun. Three days after amiodarone discontinuation, sight improved and visual field returned to normal. Although retrobulbar neuritis has been associated to various drugs, amiodarone has not been considered as a possible agent.
Aldose reductase (AR) is a multi-functional AKR (AKR1B1) that catalyzes the reduction of a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic aldehydes and their glutathione conjugates with high efficiency. Previous studies from our laboratory show that AR protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, however, the mechanisms by which it confers cardioprotection remain unknown. Because AR metabolizes aldehydes generated from lipid peroxidation, we tested the hypothesis that it protects against ischemic injury by preventing ER stress induced by excessive accumulation of aldehyde-modified proteins in the ischemic heart. In cell culture experiments, exposure to model lipid peroxidation aldehydes-4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oxovaleroyl phosphatidylcholine (POVPC) or acrolein led to an increase in the phosphorylation of ER stress markers PERK and eIF2-alpha and an increase in ATF3. The reduced metabolite of POVPC 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxyvaleroyl phosphatidylcholine (PHVPC) was unable to stimulate JNK phosphorylation. No increase in phospho-eIF2-alpha, ATF3 or phospho-PERK was observed in cells treated with the reduced HNE metabolite 1,4-dihydroxynonenol (DHN). Lysates prepared from isolated perfused mouse hearts subjected to 15 min of global ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion ex vivo showed greater phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2-alpha than hearts subjected to aerobic perfusion alone. Ischemia-induced increases in phospho-PERK and phospho-eIF2-alpha were diminished in the hearts of cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic mice overexpressing the AR transgene. These observations support the notion that by removing aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation, AR decreases ischemia-reperfusion injury by diminishing ER stress.
The patient had lower lumbar arachnoiditis as part of a failed back surgery syndrome. Two years after discectomy, she still suffered from left lumbosciatic pain despite various invasive treatments. Psychologic impairment could be excluded. Finally, intrathecal morphine was infused at the D12 level. Small amounts of morphine (500-750 mg daily) introduced intolerable vomiting, which could not be prevented by antiemetics, so intrathecal sufentanil was started. A daily dose of 25 mg of sufentanil diluted in 1.5 ml of saline evoked hyperalgesia in the lower part of the body. Increasing the dose to 50 mg daily could only be supported for 3 h. Sufentanil was stopped and saline started, after which the evoked hyperalgesia disappeared. It is concluded that relatively high doses of sufentanil may induce hyperalgesia in patients with arachnoiditis and neuropathic pain.
