The present experiments were conducted to compare the relative hypercalciuric and hypercalcemic activities of 1,24-dihydroxyvitamin D(2) [1,24-(OH)(2)D(2)], 1,24-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1, 24-(OH)(2)D(3)], and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)] in 7-week-old rats. The rats were dosed orally with each sterol for 7 days at a rate of 1 ng/g body weight/day. We also monitored the effect of the three compounds on the induction of mRNA for CaATPase and for 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase in the kidney and intestine, on plasma vitamin D metabolite levels, and on the capacity to evoke modification in the vitamin D receptor/retinoic acid X receptor (VDR/RXR) heterodimer conformation. Plasma calcium was elevated in the rats treated with 1,24-(OH)(2)D(3) and 1, 25-(OH)(2)D(3), but not in the 1,24-(OH)(2)D(2)-dosed rats. Urinary calcium was elevated significantly (relative to controls) in all groups. The order of hypercalciuric activity was 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) >/= 1,24-(OH)(2)D(3) >/= 1,24-(OH)(2)D(2) > control. Duodenal plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) mRNA was elevated to a similar extent in all groups relative to controls. Duodenal 24-hydroxylase mRNA was elevated in all groups relative to controls; however, the elevations were significantly higher in the 1,24-(OH)(2)D(3) and 1, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) groups compared with the 1,24-(OH)(2)D(2) group. Kidney 24-hydroxylase also was elevated significantly in the 1, 24-(OH)(2)D(3)- and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-treated rats but not in the 1, 24-(OH)(2)D(2)-treated rats. Recombinant human vitamin D receptor (hVDR) extracts were incubated with saturating concentrations of 1, 24-(OH)(2)D(2), 1,24-(OH)(2)D(3), and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) and subsequently analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Overall binding was comparable for all metabolites; however, the 1, 24-(OH)(2)D(2) complex exhibited distinctly altered mobility relative to 1,24-(OH)(2)D(3) and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3), suggestive of an effect on hVDR/hRXR conformation. These data suggest that 1, 24-(OH)(2)D(2) is not as potent as either of the vitamin D(3) sterols at affecting hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria in young growing rats; however, 1,24-(OH)(2)D(2) can evoke other biological responses similar to the vitamin D(3) sterols. These different responses may be related to the alterations in conformation state of the hVDR/hRXR heterodimer.
Oxidative stress, causing necrotic and apoptotic cell death, is associated with bile acid toxicity. Using liver (HepG2, Hepa1c1c7, and primary human hepatocytes) and intestinal (C2bbe1, a Caco-2 subclone) cells, we demonstrated that toxic bile acids, such as lithocholic acid (LCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid, induced the nuclear factor (erythroid-2 like) factor 2 (Nrf2) target genes, especially the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis [glutamate cysteine ligase modulatory subunit (GCLM) and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC)] and thioredoxin reductase 1. Nrf2 activation and induction of Nrf2 target genes were also evident in vivo in the liver of CD-1 mice treated 7 to 8 h or 4 days with LCA. Silencing of Nrf2 via small-interfering RNA suppressed basal and bile acid-induced mRNA levels of the above-mentioned genes. Consistent with this, overexpression of Nrf2 enhanced, but dominant-negative Nrf2 attenuated, Nrf2 target gene induction by bile acids. The activation of Nrf2-antioxidant responsive element (ARE) transcription machinery by bile acids was confirmed by increased nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, enhanced ARE-reporter activity, and increased Nrf2 binding to ARE. It is noteworthy that Nrf2 silencing increased cell susceptibility to LCA toxicity, as evidenced by reduced cell viability and increased necrosis and apoptosis. Concomitant with GCLC/GCLM induction, cellular GSH was significantly increased in bile acid-treated cells. Cotreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a GSH precursor, ameliorated LCA toxicity, whereas cotreatment with buthionine sulfoximine, a GSH synthesis blocker, exacerbated it. In summary, this study provides molecular evidence linking bile acid toxicity to oxidative stress. Nrf2 is centrally involved in counteracting such oxidative stress by enhancing adaptive antioxidative response, particularly GSH biosynthesis, and hence cell survival.
A 74-year-old female patient developed multiple local metastases after excision of a nodular melanoma of the left cheek. There was no regression after treatment with dacarbazine (DTIC) and radiotherapy. After treatment with intralesional interferon-beta, the metastases regressed completely. The dosage was 5 million IU interferon-beta (Fiblaferon) three times weekly with courses of two and four weeks, separated by a month. Except for local swelling and inflammation, no side effects occurred. Five years after completing therapy, the patient is still tumor-free.
A series of 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-7-carboxamides, presenting a stabilized intramolecular hydrogen bond, was synthesized and evaluated in pharmacological models for antipsychotic activity. Among them, N-[(1-butyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2-methyl-5-sulfamoyl-2, 3-dihydrobenzofuran-7-carboxamide (15) showed an atypical neuroleptic profile similar to that of sulpiride (1) and more lipophilic properties than 1. Compound 15 was 11 times more potent in antagonistic activity on apomorphine-induced hyperactivity in mice (ED50 = 30 mg/kg, p.o.) and stronger in potentiation of methamphetamine lethality in rats than 1, while it was as weak in inhibitory activity of apomorphine-induced stereotype in rats (ED50 greater than 500 mg/kg, p.o.) as 1. On the other hand, N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2-methyl-5-methylthio-2, 3-dihydrobenzofuran-7-carboxamide (30) showed a classical neuroleptic profile with a potency comparable to haloperidol in antagonistic activity on apomorphine-induced hyperactivity in mice (ED50 = 0.65 mg/kg, p.o.). The structure-activity relationships were also discussed.
Advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has a dismal prognosis. Modulation of the camptothecin topotecan, approved for second-line therapy, may improve response. Our recent finding of synergistic enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of camptothecin (CPT) by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitors is extended here to a panel of camptothecin analogs comprising 10-hydroxy-CPT (HOCPT), topotecan (TPT; 9-[(dimethylamino)-methyl]-10-hydroxy-CPT), 9-amino-CPT (9AC), 9-nitrocamptothecin (rubitecan), SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) and 10-hydroxy-9-nitrocamptothecin (CPT109) in combination with PD0332991, CDK4I, roscovitine and olomoucine. SCLC cell lines employed are chemoresistant NCI-H417 and DMS153 and the chemosensitive SCLC26A line established at our institution. The CPT analogs exhibiting highest cytotoxicity towards the three SCLC lines tested were SN38 and 9AC, followed by rubitecan, HOCPT, TPT and CPT109. NCI-H417 and DMS153 revealed an approximately 25-fold and 7-fold higher resistance compared to the chemosensitive SCLC26A cell line. Whereas the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 proved less effective to chemosensitize SCLC cells to CPT analogs, the CDK inhibitors CDK4I, roscovitine and olomoucine gave comparable chemosensitization effects in combination with 9AC, SN38, rubitecan and to a lesser extent with TPT and CPT109, not directly related with topoisomerase mRNA expression. In conclusion, small chemical modifications of the parent CPT structure result in differing cytotoxicities and chemomodulatory effects in combination with CDKIs of the resulting analogs.
Zygomycosis is a rare fungal infection usually found in immunocompromised patients. It is a rapidly progressing infection with a high mortality rate. Our report describes an unusual case of rhinofacial zygomycosis due to Cunninghamella sp. in an immunocompetent patient, who presented with a slowly progressive swelling of the left cheek. An interrupted course of amphotericin B treatment caused regression of the lesion. Drug therapy was abandoned due to impairment of renal function. The patient was clinically and radiologically disease free for 2 years following cessation of therapy.
It has been suggested that the liver may be at risk for ischemic damage during adenosine-induced hypotension. This notion, however, is somewhat inconsistent with the understanding that adenosine is a powerful vasodilator of the splanchnic circulation. To help clarify the effect of adenosine-induced hypotension on splanchnic hemodynamics, we studied the systemic and splanchnic hemodynamic responses to adenosine, both alone and in the presence of halothane or sevoflurane.
Systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics were determined during the infusion of adenosine in 36 rats allocated randomly to one of three study groups: (1) awake, (2) halothane anesthesia (1.0 MAC), or (3) sevoflurane anesthesia (1.0 MAC). Adenosine was infused at a rate sufficient to decrease the mean arterial pressure by 35-38% from awake control values. Cardiac output and organ blood flows were measured using the radiolabeled microsphere technique.
Adenosine infusion produced stable hypotension of rapid onset due to a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Stroke volume increased, but cardiac output remained unchanged in the awake and sevoflurane groups because of a decrease in heart rate. Infusion of adenosine during halothane anesthesia increased cardiac output enough to compensate for the decrease in cardiac output due to halothane alone. In the splanchnic circulation, there was an increase in portal tributary (42%, P < 0.01) and hepatic arterial (38%, P < 0.05) blood flows during adenosine infusion in awake rats. This resulted in an overall increase in total liver blood flow (42%, P < 0.01). Halothane anesthesia was associated with a decrease in portal tributary blood flow (28%, P < 0.05). In contrast, sevoflurane anesthesia was associated with an increase in hepatic arterial flow (35%, P < 0.05) but with no change in portal tributary blood flow. During halothane anesthesia, adenosine infusion increased portal tributary (90%, P < 0.01) and hepatic arterial (37%, P < 0.05) blood flows, thereby increasing total liver blood flow to values similar to those in awake adenosine-infused rats. During sevoflurane anesthesia, adenosine infusion increased portal tributary blood flow (48%, P < 0.01), but hepatic arterial blood flow did not increase beyond the values observed during sevoflurane anesthesia alone.
These findings demonstrate that adenosine is a potent vasodilator of portal tributary and hepatic arterial vasculature in the rat and that the splanchnic hemodynamic effects of adenosine predominate over those of halothane and sevoflurane.
Amphetamine (AMPH) is known as an anorectic agent. The anorectic action of AMPH has been attributed to its inhibitory action on hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY), an appetite stimulant in the brain. The molecular mechanisms behind this anorectic action of AMPH are still unclear. This study investigated the possible role of protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes in this anorectic action. Results revealed that most PKC isotypes (alpha, betaII, gamma, delta, eta, lambda and zeta), except betaI and epsilon isotypes, were stimulated during a repeated treatment of AMPH. Among these stimulated isotypes, three isotypes (alpha, delta, lambda) were activated and expressed in a similar manner, while the other isotypes were expressed differently and specifically. To determine if PKCalpha was involved in the anorectic response of AMPH, the infusions of antisense oligonucleotide into the brain were performed 1 h before daily AMPH treatment in freely moving rats, and the results showed that PKCalpha knock down could block the anorectic response and restore NPY mRNA levels in AMPH-treated rats. These results suggest that PKC isotypes- (at least the alpha isotype), related modification of NPY gene expression in hypothalamus might play an essential role in the central regulation of AMPH-mediated feeding suppression.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is used for treating various cancers. Its clinical use is, however, limited by its dose-limiting cardiomyopathy. The exact mechanism of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy still remains unknown. The goals were to investigate the molecular mechanism of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy and cardioprotection by mitoquinone (Mito-Q), a triphenylphosphonium-conjugated analog of coenzyme Q, using a rat model. Rats were treated with DOX, Mito-Q, and DOX plus Mito-Q for 12 weeks. The left ventricular function as measured by two-dimensional echocardiography decreased in DOX-treated rats but was preserved during Mito-Q plus DOX treatment. Using low-temperature ex vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), a time-dependent decrease in heme signal was detected in heart tissues isolated from rats administered with a cumulative dose of DOX. DOX attenuated the EPR signals characteristic of the exchange interaction between cytochrome c oxidase (CcO)-Fe(III) heme a3 and CuB. DOX and Mito-Q together restored these EPR signals and the CcO activity in heart tissues. DOX strongly downregulated the stable expression of the CcO subunits II and Va and had a slight inhibitory effect on CcO subunit I gene expression. Mito-Q restored CcO subunit II and Va expressions in DOX-treated rats. These results suggest a novel cardioprotection mechanism by Mito-Q during DOX-induced cardiomyopathy involving CcO.
The aim of this study was to examine the factors correlated with the progression of ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated by interferon and ribavirin combination therapy.
This study was conducted on 505 patients by the Osaka Liver Disease Study Group. A decline of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration by 2 g/dl at the end of 2 weeks from the start of the treatment ("2 by 2" standard) was adopted as a predictive factor for progression to severe anemia. The ribavirin apparent clearance (CL/F) was also examined.
Of 482 patients whose Hb value was more than 12 g/dl before the treatment, 68 patients (14%) had to discontinue ribavirin owing to severe anemia. Patients in the "2 by 2"-positive group (Hb decline over 2 g/dl) and the group with lower CL/F were significantly more likely to discontinue ribavirin owing to severe anemia. Discontinuation was more common among patients aged 60 years or older than for those under 60 years old (21% vs. 9%, P < 0.001). Among patients aged 60 years or older, only the "2 by 2" standard was significantly associated with the discontinuance of ribavirin owing to severe anemia in a multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 4.18; P < 0.001).
The "2 by 2" standard of Hb decline can be used to identify patients likely to develop severe anemia. The early reduction of ribavirin can help prevent progression to severe anemia, thus allowing ribavirin therapy to be completed even in older patients.
Two cases of mitomycin C nephropathy, which occurred after postoperative chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer, were followed up for 6 (case 1) and 10 years (case 2). Hemolytic uremic syndrome developed 68 days (case 1) and 160 days (case 2) after the last administration of MMC with a total dose of 60 mg (case 1) and 40 mg (case 2). Serum creatinine levels were normalized in case 1 and they remained at about 2 mg/dl in case 2. Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism was transiently seen in case 2. These data suggest that recovery from the acute phase of hemolytic uremic syndrome leads to a good long-term prognosis in MMC nephropathy.
A total of 65 patients (35 male/30 female) with multiple myeloma primarily (33) or secondarily (32) resistant to melphalan and prednisone were treated with vincristine, carmustine (BCNU), doxorubicin, and high-dose dexamethasone (VBAD) at 4-week intervals. Among 60 evaluable patients the overall response was 36.6% (21.6% objective response plus 15% improvements). The response rate was significantly higher in primarily resistant patients than in those becoming resistant after a prior response (48.4 vs. 24.1%, P < 0.05). The median duration of response was 17.5 months. When survival of responders and non-responders were compared by the conventional method, a highly significant difference was observed (P < 0.001). However, using the Mantel and Byar procedure and the landmark method, only a trend for longer survival in the responders was registered. These results indicate that although VBAD is effective in at least one third of patients with advanced multiple myeloma resistant to melphalan, its impact on survival is limited.
Podocin mutations (NPHS2 gene) are mostly responsible for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) of childhood onset. Patients with NPHS2 gene mutations do not respond to corticoids and other immunosuppressive agents; partial remission can be rarely induced by cyclosporin A. We present a boy, where SRNS was diagnosed within first year of life. By the age of 15 years, proteinuria reached 9000 mg/24 h, cholesterolemia 15 mmol/L, albuminemia 19.6 g/L, in spite of combined therapy with cyclosporine A, methylprednisolone, enalapril and losartan. At that time a combined heterozygous form of two NPHS2 gene mutations (p.R138Q and p.V290M) was diagnosed, methylprednisolone was discontinued and patient underwent ten plasmapheresis procedures. This resulted in clinical improvement (proteinuria 3000 mg/24 h, S-cholesterol 6 mmol/L, albumin 30g/L) lasting for three years. In conclusion, plasmapheresis can result in clinical improvement and stabilization of SRNS caused by podocine mutation, before renal replacement therapy is initiated.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized by a progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Microglia activation and neuroinflammation have been associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Indeed, cytokines have been proposed as candidates that mediate the apoptotic cell death of dopaminergic neurons seen in PD. In this study, we investigated the effect of two natural polyphenols, resveratrol and quercetin, on neuroinflammation. For glial cells, we observed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA levels of two proinflammatory genes, interleukin 1-alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, are strongly decreased by treatments with resveratrol or quercetin. We also undertook microglial-neuronal coculture to examine the influence of resveratrol and quercetin on dopaminergic neuronal cell death evoked by LPS-activated microglia. Cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate the percentage of cell death, with apoptotic cells identified by both the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling technique and the detection of cleaved caspase-3. We report that treatment of N9 microglial cells with resveratrol or quercetin successfully reduced the inflammation-mediated apoptotic death of neuronal cells in our coculture system. Altogether our results demonstrate that resveratrol and quercetin diminished apoptotic neuronal cell death induced by microglial activation and suggest that these two phytoestrogens may be potent antiinflammatory compounds.
One hundred twenty-one patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma treated with m- or M-BACOD (methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone) were evaluated for pretreatment characteristics predictive for response and survival. Two characteristics, poor performance status and massive bulky disease, were negatively associated with response rate in a multivariate analysis. These two characteristics were also negatively associated with survival in multivariate analysis, as was another factor, an increased number of extranodal sites of disease. These three pretreatment characteristics were used to construct a model containing 12 categories of patients at increasing risk for relapse and shortened survival. These categories divided naturally into three broad groups of patients with respective 5-year survival rates of 68%, 55%, and 24%.
Central nerve system toxicity of fluoroquinolones is well known but nearly always benign. Old age, concomittant central nerve system disease, drug interactions and/ or partial or total loss of renal function are the major risk factors. Although, in literature there is very limited number of severe central nerve system toxicity cases related to fluoroqinolones, prompt realization is vital as the only therapy is discontinuation of the drug. In this article, two cases of acute central nerve system toxicity of ofloxacin with an unexpected severity are described.
We report the case of a female liver transplant recipient who developed a recurrence of severe migraine with aura while on tacrolimus therapy with subsequent remission of headache following discontinuation of tacrolimus and substitution with sirolimus therapy. Headaches in transplant-recipient patients have become a new area of interest for headache specialists. In particular, immunosuppressant medications such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and OKT3 have been associated with development of headache syndromes in the transplant patient, exacerbation of previous headaches syndromes, and development of encephalopathies including headache as a clinical feature.
Monotherapy for the treatment of dyslipidemias is commonly insufficient to achieve all lipid targets recommended by current guidelines. Therefore, the use of combined treatment has emerged as a new option in many cases in the last few years. A review of 36 studies in which the combination of statins with fibrates was used revealed 29 cases of rhabdomyolysis with a prevalence of 0.12% in the risk of myopathy. Combination of a statin with genfibrozil appeared to cause more rhabdomyolysis than with newest fibrates (especially when compared with fenofibrate or bezafibrate). Advanced age, diabetes, females, concomitant medications, renal insufficiency, excess in alcohol intake, exercises, trauma and surgery were all associated with higher rates of adverse effects.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of proton pump inhibitors on peptic ulcers resistant to H2-receptor antagonists. Patients with ulcers resistant to at least 3 months treatment with standard or greater doses of H2-receptor antagonists were treated with 20 mg of omeprazole or 30 mg of lansoprazole, once daily, for 2 to 8 weeks. Endoscopy was performed every 2 weeks to confirm ulcer healing. Eleven of 28 (39%) gastric ulcers healed within 4 weeks and 20 (71%) within 8 weeks with omeprazole. Eight of 19 (42%) gastric ulcers healed within 4 weeks and 14 (74%) within 8 weeks with lansoprazole. All of the duodenal ulcer healed within 6 weeks with omeprazole or lansoprazole. No adverse effects were observed in this study. These results suggest that proton pump inhibitors are highly effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer resistant to H2-receptor antagonists.
We studied five patients who received local injections of botulinum toxin for dystonic disorders to determine if there had been any distant effects on neuromuscular transmission. No patient developed weakness or abnormalities on routine electrophysiologic testing. In all patients who received more than 245 U of toxin, SFEMG in the extensor digitorum communis muscle, a muscle distant to all those injected, was abnormal. Fiber density was increased in the two patients who received the largest cumulative dose. Jitter was maximally increased at slow firing rates, confirming its presynaptic basis. Our results reveal that there is an effect on neuromuscular transmission in muscles distant to those injected with botulinum toxin for dystonia.
In this report we describe a patient with Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and calcitriol-mediated hypercalcaemia. Initially, there was no clinical evidence of sarcoidosis. The patient had hypercalcaemia associated with increased calcitriol serum levels; circulating interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha levels were also elevated. At the beginning, therapy with clodronate was effective in decreasing the serum calcium levels. However, the serum calcitriol decreased only after chloroquine treatment was added. After 2 years of therapy, the patient developed progressive and extensive muscle weakness. A muscle biopsy revealed a very prominent non-caseating granulomatous myopathy. Corticosteroid therapy was then instituted. Although both chloroquine and corticosteroid therapy were associated with decreased serum interleukin and calcitriol levels, only corticosteroid therapy was effective in treating the sarcoid myopathy. The role of cytokines in calcitriol mediated hypercalcaemia is discussed.
A 67-year-old white woman developed severe nausea, vomiting, diffuse abdominal cramping pain, and blurred vision followed by a syncopal episode after taking 1 tablet of quinine for leg cramps. Examination was significant for fever, elevated blood pressure, and confusion without any focal neurological deficits. Laboratory studies showed markedly elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. Peripheral smear showed many schistocytes and burr cells. She later recalled taking quinine more than 40 years before while on a trip to the Philippines. The patient was treated with 7 sessions of plasmapheresis with a rapid normalization of her hematological parameters. Three weeks of dialysis support were required before return of renal function to baseline. Re-exposure to quinine can cause a rapid onset of hemolytic uremic syndrome-like syndrome. We are not aware of any cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome-thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in response to re-exposure to a single tablet of the drug 40 years after first use.
Uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3), a mitochondrial carrier protein predominantly expressed in muscle, has been suggested to release stored energy as heat. The insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones enhance glucose disposal in skeletal muscle and have been reported to increase the expression of uncoupling proteins in various experimental systems. We therefore studied the effect of troglitazone treatment on UCP3 gene expression in muscles from lean and obese Zucker rats. In comparison with obese littermates, basal UCP3 mRNA levels in lean Zucker rats tended to be higher in white and red gastrocnemius muscles, but were lower in soleus (P<0.001) muscle and heart (P<0.01). In lean rats, troglitazone significantly increased UCP3 gene expression in white and red gastrocnemius and heart muscles (all P<0.01). In contrast, the drug reduced UCP3 mRNA expression in red gastrocnemius and soleus muscles of obese littermates (all P<0.001). The troglitazone-dependent decrease in UCP3 gene expression was accompanied by an increased weight gain in obese rats, while no such effect was observed in lean rats. In obese rats, improvement of insulin resistance by troglitazone was associated with increased rates of basal and insulin-stimulated CO(2) production from glucose measured in soleus muscle. These studies demonstrate that effects of troglitazone on UCP3 gene expression depend on the phenotype of Zucker rats and that troglitazone-induced metabolic improvements are not related to increased uncoupling resulting from upregulation of UCP3 mRNA expression in muscle.
To study the biologic role of migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a pleiotropic cytokine, we generated a mouse strain lacking MIF by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Analysis of the role of MIF during sepsis showed that MIF-/- mice were resistant to the lethal effects of high dose bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) with D-galactosamine and had lower plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) than did wild-type mice, but normal levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10. When stimulated with LPS and interferon gamma, macrophages from MIF-/- mice showed diminished production of TNF-alpha, normal IL-6 and IL-12, and increased production of nitric oxide. MIF-/- animals cleared gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa instilled into the trachea better than did wild-type mice and had diminished neutrophil accumulation in their bronchoalveolar fluid compared to the wild-type mice. Thioglycollate elicited peritoneal exudates in uninfected MIF-/- mice, but showed normal neutrophil accumulation. Finally, the findings of enhanced resistance to P. aeruginosa and resistance to endotoxin-induced lethal shock suggest that the counteraction or neutralization of MIF may serve as an adjunct therapy in sepsis.
The pseudokinase tribbles homologue 3 (Drosophila) (TRIB3) negatively interferes with insulin-mediated phosphorylation and activation of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1 (AKT1, also known as protein kinase B). Animal studies have shown that Trib3 expression was higher in the fasting state and in animal models of diabetes, promoting hyperglycaemia presumably by increasing glucose production in the liver. Less is known about the role of TRIB3 in insulin resistance in humans, although a gain-of-function mutation associated with abnormalities related to insulin resistance has been described in TRIB3.
We determined hepatic mRNA expression of TRIB3 and selected genes encoding enzymes, transcription factors and coactivators involved in glucose homeostasis. We also determined biochemical variables of intermediary metabolism in obese patients with varying degrees of insulin resistance.
In our study population hepatic TRIB3 mRNA expression was associated with surrogate markers of insulin resistance. TRIB3 expression was significantly increased in a subgroup with high HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) compared with a low HOMA-IR group (p = 0.0033). TRIB3 transcript levels were correlated with PEPCK (also known as PCK2) mRNA expression (p = 0.0014) and mRNA expression of PPARGC1A (p = 0.0020), PPARGC1B (p < 0.0001), USF1 (p = 0.0017), FOXO1 (p = 0.0003) and SREBP-1c (also known as SREBF1; p = 0.0360). Furthermore ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha/retinoid X receptor and overexpression of its coactivator PPARGC1A as well as overexpression of SREBP-1c and its coactivator PPARGC1B increased TRIB3 promoter activity in HepG2 cells.
We have found evidence for a role of aberrant hepatic TRIB3 transcript levels in insulin resistance in obese humans and identified potential transcriptional pathways involved in regulation of TRIB3 gene expression in the liver.
