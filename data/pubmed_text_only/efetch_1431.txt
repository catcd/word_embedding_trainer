To report on the diagnostic features, management, and clinical outcome after different treatments of Wilson's disease patients followed over a mean period of 15 years.
Thirty-five patients with Wilson's disease referred to the University of Padova's Department of Gastroenterology for diagnosis or treatment were observed for a mean 15 years. The diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests (ceruloplasmin, urinary, and hepatic copper concentrations), and uptake of the radiostable isotope Cu into the plasma protein pool. Hepatic Cu content was measured by regular follow-up biopsies. Neurologic outcome after therapy was assessed using a newly developed scoring system.
Twenty-three (65.7%) patients presented with liver disease; 12 (34.3%) had mixed neurologic and hepatic involvement. All patients had been initially treated with either penicillamine (23) or zinc sulfate (12). The neurologic symptoms became worse or remained stationary in 75% of those treated with penicillamine, whereas zinc treatment improved these symptoms in 90% of treated cases. Both treatments were effective in improving the hepatic symptoms. No differences in hepatic Cu content emerged between follow-up biopsies in either treatment group. Six patients (26%) had to abandon the penicillamine treatment due to side effects. In all, 4 patients underwent liver transplantation, which was successful in 3, with a mean survival after transplantation of 4.6 years; the fourth, who had a severe neurologic impairment, died of central pontine myelinolysis.
Penicillamine and zinc can effectively treat Wilson's disease, though the side effects of penicillamine may be severe enough to prompt its suspension. Liver transplantation remains the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease.
Several studies have showed the anti-cancer efficacy of 5-FU (5-fluorouracil) on pediatric tumors. Although the delayed demyelination induced by 5-FU in adult patients has been reported, the effect of 5-FU on oligodendrocyte myelination in adolescence is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that systemic administration with 5-FU leads to immediate demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) of adolescent mice, which is mainly attributed to the death of OLs. Gene-chip microarray transcriptome analysis identifies that oligodendrocyte-specific factor TCF7L2 may be a toxic target of 5-FU-impaired myelination. 5-FU-decreased TCF7L2 results in disruption of the interaction between TCF7L2 and HDAC1/2. Inhibition of crucial myelination-promoting factors by 5-FU is more significantly antagonized by co-transfection of TCF7L2, HDAC1 and HDAC2 than TCF7L2 alone. Our findings reveal that 5-FU could acutely induce the severe myelin degeneration in adolescence and disruption of TCF7L2/HDAC1/HDAC2 complex is at least partially involved in 5-FU-induced demyelination.
The protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) catalyzes addition of the hydrophobic farnesyl isoprenoid to a cysteine residue fourth from the C terminus of several protein acceptors that are essential for cellular signal transduction such as Ras and Rho. This addition is necessary for the biological function of the modified proteins. The majority of Ras-related human cancers are associated with oncogenic variants of K-RasB, which is the highest affinity natural substrate of FTase. Inhibition of FTase causes regression of Ras-mediated tumors in animal models.
We present four ternary complexes of rat FTase co-crystallized with farnesyl diphosphate analogs and K-Ras4B peptide substrates. The Ca(1)a(2)X portion of the peptide substrate binds in an extended conformation in the hydrophobic cavity of FTase and coordinates the active site zinc ion. These complexes offer the first view of the polybasic region of the K-Ras4B peptide substrate, which confers the major enhancement of affinity of this substrate. The polybasic region forms a type I beta turn and binds along the rim of the hydrophobic cavity. Removal of the catalytically essential zinc ion results in a dramatically different peptide conformation in which the Ca(1)a(2)X motif adopts a beta turn. A manganese ion binds to the diphosphate mimic of the farnesyl diphosphate analog.
These ternary complexes provide new insight into the molecular basis of peptide substrate specificity, and further define the roles of zinc and magnesium in the prenyltransferase reaction. Zinc is essential for productive Ca(1)a(2)X peptide binding, suggesting that the beta-turn conformation identified in previous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies reflects a state in which the cysteine is not coordinated to the zinc ion. The structural information presented here should facilitate structure-based design and optimization of inhibitors of Ca(1)a(2)X protein prenyltransferases.
The effect of reduced glutathione (GSH) depletion by acetaminophen (APAP), diethylmaleate (DEM), or phorone on the mode of cell death and susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cell death was studied in cultured mouse hepatocytes. Dose-dependent necrosis was the exclusive mode of cell death with APAP alone, but the addition of TNF-alpha induced a switch to about half apoptosis without changing total loss of viability. This effect was seen at 1 and 5 mmol/L but was inhibited at 10 and 20 mmol/L APAP. The switch to apoptosis was associated with increased caspase activities, release of cytochrome c, and DNA laddering and was inhibited by caspase inhibitors. DEM and phorone also induced dose-dependent necrosis. Treatment with TNF-alpha under these conditions lead to incremental cell death in the form of apoptosis at 0.25 and 0.5 mmol/L DEM and 0.1 and 0.2 mmol/L phorone. At 1.0 and 2.0 mmol/L DEM and 0.5 mmol/L phorone, 90% to 100% necrosis was observed with resistance to TNF-alpha effects. The apoptosis with TNF-alpha plus DEM was confirmed by DNA laddering and inhibition by caspase inhibitors. However, in the presence of caspase inhibitors, the increment in cell death induced by TNF-alpha persisted as an increase in necrosis. A combination of antioxidants, vitamin E, and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) markedly inhibited necrosis induced by APAP or DEM alone, but the sensitization to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis was unaffected. GSH monoethylester (GSH-EE) protected against necrosis and apoptosis. In conclusion, depletion of GSH by APAP, DEM, or phorone causes oxidative stress-induced necrosis and sensitizes to an oxidative stress independent TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis.
Two patients are described in whom treatment of Parkinson's disease with the ergot derivative pergolide was associated with the development of erythromelalgia. The possible mechanism of pergolide-induced erythromelalgia is briefly discussed.
Studies on receptor knockout mice have so far shown that of the three alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes, the alpha(2A) adrenoceptor has a major role in mediating the powerful central analgesia induced by synthetic alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists. However, because a knockout of the gene for the alpha(2A) adrenoceptor has produced only little if any change in the pain sensitivity of control, nerve-injured, or inflamed animals, it has not been clear whether activation of alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors by endogenous ligands has a significant pain regulatory role.
The authors assessed spontaneous pain behavior and mechanical hypersensitivity induced by administration of capsaicin in the colon or paw of alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor knockout mice versus their wild-type controls.
Enhanced pain hypersensitivity was observed in alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor knockout mice 20 min or more after administration of capsaicin, but before, hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain were of equal magnitude in alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor knockout and wild-type mice. When wild-type mice were pretreated with an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, capsaicin-induced pain hypersensitivity increased to a level equal to that in alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor knockout mice. Capsaicin-induced hypersensitivity was suppressed in wild-type but not alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor knockout mice by a centrally acting alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, whereas a peripherally acting alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist was without effect on hypersensitivity, although it attenuated capsaicin-induced spontaneous pain behavior in wild-type mice.
This study shows that central alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors contribute to feedback inhibition of pain hypersensitivity. Also, alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors are critical for not only somatic but also visceral antinociceptive effects induced by synthetic alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists.
Babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) suffer from pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Elastin is a critical component of the extracellular matrix (EM) involved in pulmonary development and mechanics. Because CDH lungs are developmentally immature and have reduced compliance, the authors hypothesized that elastin deposition would be reduced and disorganized in the nitrofen rat model of CDH.
Time-dated pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed 100 mg of nitrofen on day 9 of gestation. Control rats did not receive nitrofen. The authors analyzed three groups of rats (n = 10 for each group): (1) control (C), (2) nitrofen no CDH (NC), and (3) nitrofen-induced CDH (CDH). On day 21.5 (term, 22 days), the fetuses were delivered by cesarean section, and the fetal lung was harvested. Elastin content, mRNA expression, and distribution were assessed with desmosine analysis, Northern blot analysis, and Hart's staining, respectively.
The mean desmosine content in picomole desmosine per milligram protein (pmD/mgP) +/- SD was 30 +/- 6.8 (C, n = 10), 25.1 +/- 10.1 (NC, n = 10), and 21.6 +/- 6.4 (CDH, n = 10). The comparison between CDH and controls was statistically significant (P =.026). Northern blot analysis showed decreased mRNA expression in the CDH sample. Hart's staining showed developmentally immature CDH lungs with less elastin deposition and disorganized distribution.
Pulmonary elastin expression is decreased and disorganized in the nitrofen-induced rat model of CDH. The decreased expression appears to be regulated at the level of transcription. Altered mechanical forces may be responsible for mediating the expression of elastin in CDH.
The role of the natural dietary flavonoid chemical quercetin (an antioxidant) in the prevention and treatment of colon cancer is receiving a great deal of attention. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of action of this flavonoid. In the present study, whole genome DNA microarrays were used to evaluate the effect of quercetin on gene expression in the CO115 colon-adenocarcinoma cell line with the completely deleted chromosome 18 harbouring the SMAD4 tumour-suppressor gene related to colon carcinogenesis. The study demonstrated that quercetin, widely present in fruit and vegetables, inhibited the growth of CO115 cells at 100 microM concentration in both the G(1)/S and the G(2)/M phases by modulating cell-cycle and apoptosis-related genes. Differential changes in accumulation of transcripts analysed for cells treated with 100 microM quercetin for 24 and 48 h in three independent repeated experiments revealed 5060-7000 differentially expressed genes. This means that quercetin probably does have a broad modulatory effect on gene expression in colon cancer. Out of these differentially expressed genes, the expression of 35 and 23 unique set of genes involved in cell-cycle control, apoptosis and xenobiotic metabolism were significantly altered after 24 and 48 h quercetin treatment respectively. Our results represent a novel aspect of the biological profile of quercetin that induces cell-cycle arrest through modulation of cell-cycle-related and apoptosis genes. The present study demonstrates a new step in elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms of the antitumour action of quercetin, which could become a chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent for colon cancer.
The objective was to measure progressive changes in metabolism of cows during a protocol that induced subclinical ketosis. From d 14 to 42 postpartum, 13 Holstein cows were in either a control group (6 cows) or a ketosis induction group (7 cows) that was restricted to 80% of ad libitum intake and fed 1,3-butanediol (7% of DM). Six ketosis induction cows developed ketonemia but not clinical ketosis; cow 7 developed clinical ketosis. Milk production was less, but fat content was greater, for ketonemic cows. Energy balance reached a nadir of -7.2 Mcal/d at d 21 for ketonemic cows, whereas controls reached energy equilibrium at d 28. Concentrations of NEFA in plasma and of beta-hydroxybutyrate in whole blood increased during ketonemia. Dextran sulfate-precipitable cholesterol and triglyceride in serum were increased only at d 21 and not at d 28, 35, 42, or 49. Concentrations of glycogen, total lipid, triglyceride, and cholesterol in liver increased during ketonemia. Oxidation of palmitate to CO2 was greater at d 21 in liver slices from ketonemic cows, whereas oxidation to acid-soluble products remained constant for those cows but decreased for controls. The ketonemic cows had lower weight ratios of triglyceride to glycogen in liver during pretreatment than those that became clinically ketotic in earlier studies (.5 vs. greater than or equal to 1.8). Susceptibility to clinical ketosis, therefore, may be indicated by increased hepatic triglyceride to glycogen ratios during the peripartal period.
Prophylactic administration of amantadine in doses of 100 mg. twice a day offered statistically significant protection against influenza A2 infection in a double-blind field trial involving 391 medical student volunteers during the influenza A2 Hong Kong epidemic in Helsinki in the winter of 1969. Serologically verified influenza, as measured by complement fixation and/or haemagglutination inhibition, occurred in 27 out of 192 students in the amantadine group against 57 out of 199 in the placebo group, giving a protection rate of 52%.
Amisulpride in antipsychotic doses can induce hyperprolactinemia. The aim of this study was to prove whether the same is true for low doses of amisulpride.
Plasma prolactin levels were measured in 5 males and 5 females with depressive symptoms who were treated with 50 mg of amisulpride per day as an augmentation to antidepressants (n=5), benzodiazepine anxiolytics (n=8) or in monotherapy (n=1). Six of these patients were assessed prior to onset of amisulpride treatment and after 10 days of amisulpride use. Four patients had been using amisulpride for more than a month.
There was a significant increase of prolactin levels from mean 16+/-6 ng/ml to 113+/-65 ng/ml (median 14.5 ng/ml to median 92 ng/ml; Wilcoxon matched pair test, p=0.027). All patients had hyperprolactinemia (30-200 ng/ml). The prolactinemia was significantly higher in females (mean 160+/-50 ng/ml; median 198 ng/ml) than in males (mean 48+/-12 ng/ml; median 48 ng/ml; Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.041).
Even low doses of amisulpride used as an augmentation to antidepressant treatment, benzodiazepines or in monotherapy seem to be associated with hyperprolactinemia. The co-medication of antidepressants and benzodiazepines can potentially increase intensity of prolactinemia.
Dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of heart failure with systolic dysfunction. Medications used to treat this condition are usually for symptomatic relief. We studied the effect of atenolol in heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy in a double blinded randomized fashion. There were 17 males and 5 females. All patients underwent right and left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, endomyocardial biopsy, exercise testing and doppler echocardiography. By 3 months, atenolol significantly reduced resting and exercise heart rate and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. There was no difference in exercise capacity. We conclude from this study that atenolol improve hemodynamic condition in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy without improving exercise capacity during this short observation period.
We studied the effects on the cardiovascular system and isolated intestine of three potential antidepressants : amineptin, nomifensin and mianserin. 1) No animals died in spite of doses well above the therapeutic range, evidencing the good tolerance of the compounds. 2) Effects on heart rate were variable; the only significant effect was cardioacceleration seen with mianserin in doses above 5 mg/kg. 3) The only significant effect on the auriculoventricular refractory period was recorded with mianserin. 4) Amineptin was the only compound that increased blood pressure. 5) Auriculoventricular conduction was slowed with mianserin in doses above 10 mg/kg. 6) On isolated rat duodenum, mianserin was spasmogenic in concentrations above 100 microgram/100 ml. 7) in comparison to tricyclic antidepressants, these three compounds carry only few risks of adverse side-effects.
Conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) is the most commonly prescribed estrogen therapy, and is the estrogen used in the Women's Health Initiative study. While in-vitro studies suggest that CEE is neuroprotective, no study has evaluated CEE's effects on a cognitive battery and brain immunohistochemistry in an animal model. The current experiment tested whether CEE impacted: I) spatial learning, reference memory, working memory and long-term retention, as well as ability to handle mnemonic delay and interference challenges; and, II) the cholinergic system, via pharmacological challenge during memory testing and ChAT-immunoreactive cell counts in the basal forebrain. Middle-aged ovariectomized (Ovx) rats received chronic cyclic injections of either Oil (vehicle), CEE-Low (10 microg), CEE-Medium (20 microg) or CEE-High (30 microg) treatment. Relative to the Oil group, all three CEE groups showed less overnight forgetting on the spatial reference memory task, and the CEE-High group had enhanced platform localization during the probe trial. All CEE groups exhibited enhanced learning on the spatial working memory task, and CEE dose-dependently protected against scopolamine-induced amnesia with every rat receiving the highest CEE dose maintaining zero errors after scopolamine challenge. CEE also increased number of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons in the vertical diagonal band of the basal forebrain. Neither the ability to remember after a delay nor interference, nor long-term retention, was influenced by the CEE regimen used in this study. These findings are similar to those reported previously for 17 beta-estradiol, and suggest that CEE can provide cognitive benefits on spatial learning, reference and working memory, possibly through cholinergic mechanisms.
Determine the hemodynamic consequences of intraoperative clonidine during major abdominal surgery.
Prospective open trial.
Teaching hospital.
402 consecutive patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery.
350 consecutive patients received intravenous (IV) clonidine (loading dose of 4 micrograms/kg in 20 minutes at anesthesia induction, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 micrograms/kg/h until the end of surgery). Fifty-two additional patients served as controls. Anesthetic technique consisted of balanced anesthesia (isoflurane, fentanyl, atracurium). ECG, invasive arterial blood pressure (BP), expiratory PCO2 and pulse oximetry were continuously recorded. Hemodynamic events (HEs) were defined as moderate for a 20% reduction of the baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) or a heart rate (HR) decreasing between 50 beats per minute (bpm) and 40 bpm. A 30% reduction of the baseline SBP or a HR below 40 bpm was considered an important HE. The rate and duration of these events were recorded from induction to recovery. HEs requiring a specific treatment were noted. Central venous pressure, volume of fluid infused, and urinary output were also recorded.
21% of control patients and 31% of clonidine patients had no adverse HEs. A moderate reduction of the baseline BP was the most common episode in both groups. The incidence of the HEs (moderate and important) was similar in both groups but the duration HEs was significantly longer in the clonidine patients (p < 0.05). 40% of the control patients and 13% of the clonidine patients required specific management for their HEs (p < 0.05), the most common of which was hypotension without bradycardia. Neither coexisting pathology nor preoperative medications influenced the incidence of HEs.
IV clonidine can be used routinely during anesthesia for major abdominal surgery.
Currently available local anesthetics have relatively brief durations of action. An ultralong-acting local anesthetic would benefit patients with acute and chronic pain. The authors prepared and characterized a novel liposomal bupivacaine formulation using remote loading of bupivacaine along an ammonium sulfate gradient and assessed its efficacy in humans.
A large multivesicular liposomal bupivacaine formulation was prepared by subjecting small unilamellar vesicles to successive freeze-and-thaw cycles. Bupivacaine hydrochloride was then remotely loaded into the liposomes along an ammonium sulfate gradient ([(NH4)2SO4)]intraliposome/[(NH4)2SO4)]medium > 1000). The liposomes were then characterized for size distribution; drug-to-phospholipid ratio; in vitro release profile at 4 degree, 21 degree C, and 37 degree C; sterility; and pyrogenicity. Six subjects each received six intradermal injections in the lower back with 0.5 ml of 0.5, 1.0, and 2% liposomal bupivacaine; 0.5% standard bupivacaine; saline; and "empty" liposomes. Duration of analgesia was assessed using pinprick testing of the skin directly over the injection sites. Results were compared using the log-rank test.
The mean large multivesicular vesicle size was 2439 +/- 544 nm, with a drug-to-phospholipid ratio of 1.8, fivefold greater than results previously reported. In vitro release was slowest at 4 degree C. The median duration of analgesia with 0.5% standard bupivacaine was 1 h. The median durations of analgesia after 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0% liposomal bupivacaine were 19, 38, and 48 h, respectively. Neither saline nor "empty" liposomes produced analgesia.
This novel liposomal formulation had a favorable drug-to-phospholipid ratio and prolonged the duration of bupivacaine analgesia in a dose-dependent manner. If these results in healthy volunteers can be duplicated in the clinical setting, this formulation has the potential to significantly impact the management of pain.
It has been suggested that stimulation of adrenoreceptors could be responsible for some of the haemodynamic effects of isoflurane. But there are no solid data demonstrating the role of sympatho-adrenal stimulation induced by pain during isoflurane administration. The impact of surgical stress on the haemodynamic profile of isoflurane-induced hypotension has been investigated in 28 patients (47-76 years), scheduled for total hip arthroplasty. After premedication with morphine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), patients were randomly assigned to receive either no fentanyl (control group) or fentanyl (5 micrograms/kg before tracheal intubation, 5 micrograms/kg before skin incision, and 2 micrograms/kg each 15 min during the 1st hour). Isoflurane was given to maintain mean arterial blood pressure in the range 6.7-8 kPa in both groups. Haemodynamic data and blood samples for determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) and epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) levels were collected before and during hypotension. The fentanyl group and the control group differed significantly during hypotension: heart rate, cardiac index, oxygen consumption and E, NE and PRA were lower (P less than 0.01) in the fentanyl group than in control group. Fentanyl lowered the required concentration of isoflurane to achieve the same degree of hypotension (end-tidal concentration: 0.8 +/- 0.2% in the fentanyl group and 1.4 +/- 0.15% in the control group; P less than 0.001). Our results demonstrate that the cardiovascular effects of higher isoflurane concentrations in the absence of narcotic analgesia are counterbalanced by adrenergic stress stimulation of released epinephrine and norepinephrine. Among the likely reasons for catecholamine release during isoflurane administration, inadequate analgesia may be considered.
Mesna (sodium-2-mercaptoethansulfonate) is used in the prophylaxis of cyclophosphamide (CYC)-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Four patients being treated with "low dose" CYC and prednisone for vasculitis developed severe side effects to Mesna. Fever, arthralgia, myalgia, tachycardia, electrocardiogram changes consistent with perimyocarditis, erythroderma, bullous skin and mucous membrane lesions, and abdominal complaints with profuse diarrhea were noted approximately 3 weeks after the initiation of therapy for CYC-induced leukopenia and a conservatively reduced prednisone dosage. Positive reexposure tests confirmed the association to Mesna use, and hypersensitivity skin tests demonstrated a delayed hypersensitivity reaction.
This study examined the impact of prison-initiated methadone maintenance at 12 months postrelease. Males with pre-incarceration heroin dependence (N = 204) were randomly assigned to (a) Counseling Only: counseling in prison, with passive referral to treatment upon release; (b) Counseling + Transfer: counseling in prison with transfer to methadone maintenance treatment upon release; and (c) Counseling + Methadone: counseling and methadone maintenance in prison, continued in the community upon release. The mean number of days in community-based drug abuse treatment were, respectively, Counseling Only, 23.1; Counseling + Transfer, 91.3; and Counseling + Methadone, 166.0 (p < .01); all pairwise comparisons were statistically significant (all ps < .01). Counseling + Methadone participants were also significantly less likely than participants in each of the other two groups to be opioid-positive or cocaine-positive according to urine drug testing. These results support the effectiveness of prison-initiated methadone for males in the United States. Further study is required to confirm the findings for women.
Few studies address the dynamic effect of opioids on respiration. Models with intact feedback control of carbon dioxide on ventilation (non-steady-state models) that correctly incorporate the complex interaction among drug concentration, end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide concentration, and ventilation yield reliable descriptions and predictions of the behavior of opioids. The authors measured the effect of remifentanil on respiration and developed a model of remifentanil-induced respiratory depression.
Ten male healthy volunteers received remifentanil infusions with different infusion speeds (target concentrations: 4-9 ng/ml; at infusion rates: 0.17-9 ng x ml x min) while awake and at the background of low-dose propofol. The data were analyzed with a nonlinear model consisting of two additive linear parts, one describing the depressant effect of remifentanil and the other describing the stimulatory effect of carbon dioxide on ventilation.
The model adequately described the data including the occurrence of apnea. Most important model parameters were as follows: C50 for respiratory depression 1.6 +/- 0.03 ng/ml, gain of the respiratory controller (G) 0.42 - 0.1 l x min x Torr, and remifentanil blood effect site equilibration half-life (t(1/2)ke0) 0.53 +/- 0.2 min. Propofol caused a 20-50% reduction of C50 and G but had no effect on t(1/2)ke0. Apnea occurred during propofol infusion only. A simulation study revealed an increase in apnea duration at infusion speeds of 2.5-0.5 ng x ml x min followed by a reduction. At an infusion speed of < or = 0.31 ng x ml x min, no apnea was seen.
The effect of varying remifentanil infusions with and without a background of low-dose propofol on ventilation and end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide concentration was described successfully using a non-steady-state model of the ventilatory control system. The model allows meaningful simulations and predictions.
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a familial tumor syndrome characterized by the development of hamartomas in the brain, heart, kidney, and skin. Disease-causing mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene result in constitutive activation of the highly conserved mTOR signal transduction pathway, which regulates cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (sirolimus), reduces disease severity in rodent models of TSC, and is currently in phase II clinical trials. The cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is another potential therapeutic agent for TSC. A high-expressing IFN-gamma allele is associated with a lower frequency of kidney tumors in TSC patients, and treatment with exogenous IFN-gamma reduces the severity of TSC-related disease in mouse models. Here, we examine the effects of treating tumor-bearing nude mice with a combination of a rapamycin analog (CCI-779) and IFN-gamma. We observed that combination therapy was more effective than single agent therapy in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in this mouse model of TSC. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses showed that tumors treated with CCI-779 plus IFN-gamma had decreased cell proliferation and increased cell death in comparison with untreated tumors or tumors treated with either agent alone. We also observed that CCI-779 resistance could develop with prolonged treatment. Taken together, our results show that targeting multiple cellular pathways is an effective strategy for treating TSC-related tumors, and underscore the importance of investigating combination therapy in future clinical trials for patients with TSC.
Methamphetamine (METH)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be produced by oxidative stress and free radical generation. The present study was undertaken to investigate if METH generates peroxynitrite and produces dopaminergic neurotoxicity. We also investigated if this generation of peroxynitrite can be blocked by a selective peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, 5, 10,15, 20-tetrakis(N-methyl-4'-pyridyl)porphyrinato iron III (FeTMPyP) and protect against METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Administration of METH resulted in the significant formation of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), an in vivo marker of peroxynitrite generation, in the striatum and also caused a significant increase in the body temperature. METH injection also caused a significant decrease in the concentration of dopamine (DA), 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA) by 76%, 53% and 40%, respectively, in the striatum compared with the control group. Treatment with FeTMPyP blocked the formation of 3-NT by 66% when compared with the METH group. FeTMPyP treatment also provided significant protection against the METH-induced hyperthermia and depletion of DA, DOPAC and HVA. Administration of FeTMPyP alone neither resulted in 3-NT formation nor had any significant effect on DA or its metabolite concentrations. These findings indicate that peroxynitrite plays a role in METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and also suggests that peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts may be beneficial for the management of psychostimulant abuse.
