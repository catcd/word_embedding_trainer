The hemodynamic effects of indapamide were evaluated in an open clinical trial of nine patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements were made before and after six weeks of treatment with single daily doses of 2.5 mg of indapamide. Indapamide significantly reduced the mean standing systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.025), the mean standing diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01), the mean arterial blood pressure (P less than 0.001), and the mean total peripheral vascular resistance (P less than 0.01). Cardiac output increased 12% (P less than 0.05) during treatment. The heart rate, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, systolic volume, and ejection fraction were not markedly altered after treatment with indapamide, although the systolic wall stress index fell slightly. Six weeks of indapamide administration was well tolerated with no notable adverse effects of the drug. The results suggest that indapamide reduces arterial blood pressure in hypertensive patients by decreasing total peripheral resistance.
Organic chemicals such as jet fuels and solvents can cause skin irritation after dermal exposure. The molecular responses to these chemicals resulting in acute irritation are not understood well enough to establish safe exposure limits. Male F-344 rats were dermally exposed to JP-8 jet fuel for 1 h using Hill Top Chambers. Whole skin samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after the beginning of the exposures, homogenized, and analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein and nitrite levels. IL-1alpha levels (determined by ELISA) ranged from approximately 11 to 34% above the 0-h samples over the observed time period. At 1 and 2 h, significantly higher (p < 0.05) levels of IL-1alpha were detected when compared to the 0-h samples. Western blot analysis revealed significantly higher (p < 0.05) levels of iNOS at 4 and 6 h compared to 0-h samples. Increases in IL-1alpha and iNOS expression were also observed in the skin immunohistochemically. Nitrite concentrations in skin samples were measured to estimate nitric oxide production. Although nitrite concentrations in the skin increased approximately 6-27% above the 0-h samples over the observed time period, no significant changes in nitrite levels were detected. Pathological changes in the skin following JP-8 exposure were evaluated histologically. Increased numbers of granulocytes were observed infiltrating the skin at 2 h and were more prominent by 6 h. These data show that a 1-h exposure to JP-8 results in a local inflammatory response, which can be detected by changes in molecular and histological parameters.
A patient with Sulindac-induced hepatitis is presented. Sulindac was confirmed as the cause of the patient's liver disease when hepatic dysfunction abruptly recurred after an inadvertent reexposure to Sulindac and quickly resolved when the drug was withdrawn. The prompt reappearance of fever, chills, pruritus, rash, tender hepatomegaly, and abnormal liver tests after only two doses of Sulindac suggested a hypersensitivity reaction.
This study evaluated the efficacy of and tolerance to moxalactam in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea, including two infections with penicillin-resistant strains. After appropriate cultures, 87 women and 64 men each received 1 gm of moxalactam intramuscularly as a single injection. Penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from one man who had persistent urethritis after therapy with ampicillin. Another isolate showed high relative resistance to penicillin. At follow-up in three to seven days, moxalactam eradicated N gonorrhoeae from all 120 evaluable patients including the two with penicillin resistance and five women with rectal gonorrhea. Moxalactam administered intramuscularly was well tolerated and the few adverse effects were usually mild. In this study, 1 gm of moxalactam appeared to be virtually 100% effective and safe for therapy of adults with uncomplicated anogenital gonorrhea.
The authors examined 33 patients aged 59.9 years with a new atrial fibrillation and 18 patients aged 45.6 years with attacks of supraventricular tachycardia. After medicamentous change to a sinus rhythm (in fibrillation after digoxin and verapamil i.v. and in supraventricular tachycardia after verapamil i.v.) the patients were changed to oral antiarrhythmic drugs. The method of diagnostic oesophageal stimulation was used after saturation with the oral form to test the effectiveness of long-term treatment. In the author's opinion the basic drug in atrial fibrillation is digoxin, possibly combined with verapamil or quinidine. In supraventricular tachycardia the basic drug is verapamil, in particular in case of a double AV node pathway. In the majority of patients combined treatment is indicated, selected individually by means of diagnostic oesophageal stimulation. The authors consider the described method due to its innocuous and repeatable character as the method of choice for optimization of antiarrhythmic treatment of supraventricular dysrhythmias.
Recent studies by our laboratory indicate that the p16(INK4a) gene is frequently methylated in lung tumors induced by genotoxic carcinogens and that the frequency for methylation of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) gene varies as a function of carcinogenic exposure. The purpose of the current investigation was to define the role of these two genes in lung tumors induced by the particulate carcinogens carbon black (CB), diesel exhaust (DE) or beryllium metal. Methylation of p16 was observed in 59 and 46% of DE and CB tumors, respectively. In contrast, the ER gene was inactivated in only 15% of DE or CB tumors. Methylation of the p16 and ER genes was very common (80 and 50%, respectively) in beryllium-induced lung tumors; both genes were methylated in 40% of the tumors. Bisulfite sequencing revealed dense methylation throughout exon 1 of the ER gene. The inhibitory effect of methylation on gene transcription was confirmed through RT-PCR expression studies in which p16 gene expression was 30-60-fold lower in methylated than unmethylated tumors. Residual expression in methylated tumors was consistent with contamination by stromal and inflammatory cells. Results indicate that tumors induced by these particulate carcinogens arise, in part, through inactivation of the p16 and ER genes. Furthermore, the inactivation of the p16 gene by these carcinogenic exposures supports a possible role for oxidative stress and inflammation in the etiology of human lung cancer.
A case of drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia is described. A 2 year old boy exhibited sudden anemia and hemoglobinuria after administration of minocycline (MINO). The specific immunoglobulin G antibody against MINO was demonstrated in the patient's serum by western blotting. This is a rare example where anti-minocycline immune complex-mediated hemolysis was responsible for an intravascular hemolytic process.
In 173 women less than 50 years of age with myocardial infarction, angiographic evidence of coronary sclerosis was observed in only 108 (62%). Completely normal coronary arteries were found in 15 patients (9%) and in 50 patients (29%) an isolated poorly delineated stenosis was found in the presence of otherwise completely normal coronary arteries. Of the 65 patients with myocardial infarction but without typical coronary sclerosis, 47 (72%) were taking oral contraceptives at the time of infarction. In 60% of the oral contraceptive users with infarction, angiographically, there was no evidence of typical coronary sclerosis. With the exception of cigarette smoking, the number of atherogenic risk factors in these patients was low such that myocardial infarction during treatment with oral contraceptives may possibly represent a separate disease entity distinguishable from coronary sclerosis. In support of this, in some cases, repeat angiography demonstrated spontaneous regression of the isolated stenosis. Etiologically, possible thromboembolic vascular occlusion has been assumed. In women in the premenopausal years, coronary sclerosis is uncommon and usually associated with a substantial number of atherogenic risk factors. In this case, 29% of the women had used oral contraceptives, the causal role of which remains uncertain. Even though oral contraceptive use is associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction, apparently, it cannot be regarded as a typical atherogenic risk factor.
A double-blind, randomised, 6-month clinical trial with parallel group design in 149 patients with gingivitis was conducted to study the efficacy and safety of delmopinol hydrochloride 2 mg/ml (0.2% w/v, Decapinol Mouthwash) used for partly supervised mouthrinsing in comparison with chlorhexidine digluconate 2 mg/ml (0.2% w/v, Hibitane Dental, ICI Pharmaceuticals, UK) and placebo as an addition to normal oral hygiene. Assessments of efficacy were performed using the plaque index and bleeding on probing (BOP). Delmopinol showed 22% lower plaque index scores than placebo after 3 months (p<0.01) and 13% lower scores after 6 months. The corresponding figures for chlorhexidine were 38% (p<0.001) and 38% (p<0.001) after 3 and 6 months, respectively. Bleeding on probing was reduced for delmopinol in comparison with placebo by 11% after 3 months and by 18% (p<0.05) after 6 months. For chlorhexidine the corresponding figures were 18% (p<0.01) and 22% (p<0.01) after 3 and 6 months, respectively. While chlorhexidine showed greater plaque reduction than delmopinol (p<0.01 at 6 months), no statistically significant difference was reached between these two solutions regarding BOP. Both active solutions showed an increased amount of dental calculus in comparison with placebo. A transient anaesthetic sensation in the oral mucosa and taste affection were commonly reported adverse events in both the delmopinol and the chlorhexidine groups. The number of patients withdrawn from treatment due to adverse events or lack of cooperation was 7 in the chlorhexidine group, 4 in the placebo group and 1 in the delmopinol group. The results showed that rinsing with either 0.2% delmopinol hydrochloride or 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate twice daily for 60 secs for 6 months results in less plaque formation and gingivitis than rinsing with placebo. Mouthrinsing with the 0.2% delmopinol hydrochloride solution was well accepted in this study.
An 82-year-old woman with persistent atrial fibrillation underwent successful electrical cardioversion and was begun on sotalol. After 3 days of in-hospital observation she had only mild lengthening of the QT interval. Two weeks later in clinic, the day after her husband's unexpected death, she was noted to have profound QT interval prolongation. Although she was asymptomatic and echocardiography did not disclose regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, she probably had a forme fruste of stress cardiomyopathy. Following emotional trauma, a period of heightened vigilance for ventricular proarrhythmia is probably warranted in women treated with antiarrhythmic drugs that lengthen repolarization.
Early language development is known to be under genetic influence, but the genes affecting normal variation in the general population remain largely elusive. Recent studies of disorder reported that variants of the CNTNAP2 gene are associated both with language deficits in specific language impairment (SLI) and with language delays in autism. We tested the hypothesis that these CNTNAP2 variants affect communicative behavior, measured at 2 years of age in a large epidemiological sample, the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Singlepoint analyses of 1149 children (606 males and 543 females) revealed patterns of association which were strikingly reminiscent of those observed in previous investigations of impaired language, centered on the same genetic markers and with a consistent direction of effect (rs2710102, P = 0.0239; rs759178, P = 0.0248). On the basis of these findings, we performed analyses of four-marker haplotypes of rs2710102-rs759178-rs17236239-rs2538976 and identified significant association (haplotype TTAA, P = 0.049; haplotype CGAG, [corrected] P = .0014). Our study suggests that common variants in the exon 13-15 region of CNTNAP2 influence early language acquisition, as assessed at age 2, in the general population. We propose that these CNTNAP2 variants increase susceptibility to SLI or autism when they occur together with other risk factors.
First-line chemotherapy regimens suitable for elderly advanced breast cancer patients are still not defined.
Women with stage III or IV breast cancer aged > or =70 years were enrolled in a phase II study aimed to evaluate both activity and toxicity of weekly paclitaxel. Among 46 planned patients, at least 18 responses and not more than seven unacceptable toxic events are required for a favourable conclusion. Paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) was administered weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days.
Unacceptable toxicity occurred in seven out of 46 patients evaluated for toxicity [15.2%; exact 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.6% to 28.2%] and was represented by one case of febrile neutropenia, one case of severe allergic reaction and five cases of cardiac toxicity. Among 41 patients evaluated for response, a complete response occurred in two (4.9%) patients and a partial response in 20 (48.8%), with an overall response rate of 53.7% (exact 95% CI 38.7% to 67.9%). The median progression-free survival was 9.7 months (95% CI 8.5-18.7) and median survival was 35.8 months (95% CI 19-not defined).
Weekly paclitaxel is highly active in elderly advanced breast cancer patients. Data on cardiovascular complications, however, indicate the need for a careful monitoring of cardiac function before and during chemotherapy.
A 60-year-old woman who had been successfully treated with atenolol and cardiac pacing for hypertension and long QT syndrome developed recurrent episodes of palpitations and syncope. Several days prior to these episodes, indapamide 2.5 mg/day was taken for better control of hypertension. The episodes were associated with prolongation of QT interval and mild hypokalemia (3.1 MEQ/L). Indapamide was immediately stopped, but the QT remained prolonged 2 days later, although the potassium level was normalized. This case suggests that indapamide can cause potassium independent prolongation of the QT interval, resulting in arrhythmia induced syncope.
Cross-sectional echocardiography was used to evaluate two neonates whose mothers ingested lithium during pregnancy. In one infant, Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve was identified. In the other infant cross-sectional echocardiography provided reassurance that the infant did not have Ebstein's anomaly. Cross-sectional echocardiographic screening of newborns exposed to lithium during gestation can provide highly accurate, noninvasive assessment of the presence or absence of lithium-induced cardiac malformations.
Captopril treatment was given to 30 children aged 8 months to 16 years (mean age 10.1 years) with renal hypertension when combinations of one or more of betablockers, diuretics, clonidine and hydralazine had failed to reduce blood pressure in the majority of the children. Dosages of captopril varied between 0.5 and 11.0 mg/kg BW, which was combined with furosemide in 15 cases, betablockers in three cases, betablockers and clonidine in two cases. Pretreatment mean plasma renin activity (PRA) was 7.9 (0.8-89.4) ng AT/ml/h in 22 of the 30 children and 59% had more than 2.0 ng AT/ml/h. Blood pressure fell from a mean of 158/109 (range 135/75 - 240/140) mm Hg to a mean of 120/76 (range 110/65 - 150/100) mm Hg. Mean duration time was 10.1 months (1-47 months). Skin rash occurred in three cases and taste disturbance in one case. Falling glomerular filtration rate was observed in two children with diseases of the renal vessels. After withdrawal of captopril renal function returned to the pretreatment level. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition for treatment of hypertension in childhood has proved to be efficient and safe in these 30 children.
Ciprofloxacin is considered to be the standard treatment for patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI). This multicentre, randomized clinical study was designed to compare a once-daily regimen with 500 mg to the usual twice-daily regimen with 250 mg orally for 7-20 days. A total of 215 patients with significant bacteriuria (> or = 10(5) c.f.u./ml for females and > or = 10(4) c.f.u./ml for males) were included in the study. Eradication of bacteriuria was shown in 84.0% of patients treated with 500 mg q.i.d. and in 90.9% of patients treated with 250 mg b.i.d. Clinical cure or improvement was achieved in 97.3% of those treated with 500 mg q.i.d. versus 95.5% of those treated with 250 mg b.i.d. More superinfections occurred in patients treated with 500 mg q.i.d., mostly caused by gram-positive cocci. The statistical analysis concerning the elimination of bacteriuria using the 95% confidence interval showed a difference of up to 18.4% between the two treatment groups in favour of the 250-mg b.i.d. regimen. Ciprofloxacin was well tolerated with only mild to moderate side-effects (mostly gastrointestinal) in 8% of the patients. When using ciprofloxacin in patients with complicated UTI, its administration in two divided doses can be further recommended as a standard regimen.
Delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, causes nonfatal convulsions in rabbits of a closed colony of New Zealand White rabbits (Uaz: NZW). The convulsive phenotype appears to be associated with homozygous expression of a single autosomal recessive gene with full penetrance. We propose the symbol thc for the gene responsible for this condition. We also propose that this closed colony of New Zealand White rabbits at the University of Arizona, in which the thc gene is segragating, be designated Uaz:NZW-thc.
The incidence of 5-azacytidine-induced exencephaly was compared between MT/HokIdr strain (MT) and Slc:ICR strain (ICR) mice. MT mice have a genetic predisposition for exencephaly, but ICR mice do not. Pregnant mice were given 5-azacytidine (1 mg/kg to 100 micrograms/kg) injected intraperitoneally on Day 7.5 of gestation (vaginal plug day = Day 0.5), and fetuses were observed for external malformations on Day 18.5 of gestation. One hundred micrograms/kg 5-azacytidine induced exencephaly in MT mice but not in ICR mice, and 1 mg/kg 5-azacytidine resulted in resorptions in MT mice but caused exencephaly in ICR mice. These results indicated that MT mice had 10-fold more sensitivity to 5-azacytidine than ICR mice. It seems likely that less than effective doses of teratogens for animals without genetic predispositions are still effective in inducing malformations in animals with a genetic predisposition for malformations. When 4-somite-stage embryos of both MT and ICR mice were cultured in rat serum supplemented with 5-azacytidine, 0.02 micrograms/ml 5-azacytidine induced the failure of closure of cephalic neural tube in MT embryos but not in ICR embryos, and 0.2 micrograms/ml 5-azacytidine induced severe growth retardation in MT embryos but in ICR embryos it only induced embryos with smaller heads and fewer somites than in control. These results indicated that MT mouse embryos in culture also had a 10-fold-increased sensitivity to 5-azacytidine compared with ICR mouse embryos, suggesting maternal effects play no significant role in their increased sensitivity to 5-azacytidine.
We describe a fatal case of Reye's syndrome in a 12-year-old male patient during an influenza A (H3N2) infection for which he received salicylates. In the current situation of the novel A/H1N1 virus pandemic, we believe that it is of high importance to emphasize the risks associated with salicylate intake to avoid the reappearance of Reye's syndrome.
This report describes three Belgian cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the use of L-tryptophan-containing products. Three women, aged 51, 53 and 73 years, were taking L-tryptophan for 2 months to 2 years, at 500, 1500, and 2250 mg d-1, respectively. All developed disabling myalgias, fatigue, and a variable skin rash, in association with marked eosinophilia. In one patient, symptoms and eosinophilia reappeared after rechallenge with L-tryptophan. Discontinuation of the drug resulted in gradual disappearance of the symptoms, signs and laboratory abnormalities in two patients. One patient was treated with corticosteroids because of persisting myalgias. Because of the non-specific clinical manifestations, clinicians from all subspecialties of internal medicine might be confronted with such patients and should be aware of this new entity.
The objective of this study was to investigate the acute toxicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of paliperidone derivatives (PDs) compared with paliperidone and risperidone. The i.g. LD(50) and i.v. maximum tolerated doses of PD1, PD5 and PD6 were greater than those of paliperidone and risperidone in mice. Pharmacokinetic study showed that PDs were quickly metabolized to paliperidone to take effect in the treatment of schizophrenia in rats after i.g. administration. Only traces of the parent substances were found. Pharmacodynamic study showed that PDs significantly reduced MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion in mice. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 and 60 min. in anaesthetized rats after i.v. injection of 0.21, 0.59, 1.69 micromol/kg drugs. Heart rate reduction had a linear relation with dose after i.v. injection of PDs, paliperidone and risperidone. No significant change in the ECG parameters was found in all groups after administration of the low dose. Although the reductions in heart rate and the corrected QT interval (QTc) were observed in all drugs at the high dose, PD5 and PD6 were associated with smaller effects on the ECG parameters than other compounds, including paliperidone and risperidone. Therefore, PD5 and PD6 could be potential candidates for the treatment of schizophrenia.
The safety and efficacy of total dose infusion (TDI) of iron dextran has been well documented. In 40% of treated patients, an arthralgia-myalgia syndrome develops. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous (i.v.) administration of methylprednisolone (MP) prevents this complication. Sixty-five patients, 34 women and 31 men, ages 36 to 80 years, received either normal saline before and after TDI (group 1), 125 mg i.v. MP before and saline after TDI (group 2), or 125 mg i.v. MP before and after TDI (group 3). Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity. Fifty-eight percent of group 1 patients, 33% of group 2, and 26% of group 3 had reactions to TDI. The severity of reactions (minimal, mild, and moderate, respectively) was as follows: group 1--6, 6, and 2; group 2--1, 5, and 0; group 3--5, 1, and 0. Data were analyzed by the two-sided Fisher's exact test using 95% confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf. These data demonstrate that administration of MP before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the arthralgia-myalgia syndrome. We conclude that 125 mg i.v. MP should be given routinely before and after TDI of iron dextran.
The presence of polyamines in the brain, together with the previous reports of a structural similarity with neuroleptics, has led to the hypothesis that polyamines may have a modulatory role in the control of cerebral dopamine function. In this study, the effects of two polyamines, spermine and spermidine, were therefore tested on indices of dopamine-mediated behaviour in rats and mice. Spermine and spermidine caused a dose-dependent inhibition of mouse spontaneous climbing behaviour and wheel running at doses between 5 and 40 mg/kg IP but failed to cause catalepsy in the rat or to antagonise the stereotyped behaviour induced by apomorphine. When polyamines were given by intracerebral injection a similar regional selectivity was seen. Both spermine and spermidine (5-20 micrograms) when given bilaterally into the nucleus accumbens inhibited the hyperactivity caused by amphetamine injected into the same nucleus. However, when injected into the rat corpus striatum, neither polyamine was able to initiate any asymmetry or circling either spontaneously or after apomorphine injection IP. These results indicated a selective action of polyamines on mesolimbic dopamine behaviour. Possible implications for the understanding of psychosis and future work are suggested.
A group of 19 geriatric bipolar lithium patients were interviewed in order to assess the incidence, bothersomeness and intensity of medication side effects. The role of subject variables was also examined. Most often reported side effects included excessive thirst, hand tremor, excessive urination and dry mouth. Although many side effects were experienced, these effects were generally tolerated with minimal intensity and bothersomeness. Results indicate that with proper precautions and monitoring, lithium can be safely administered to geriatric bipolar patients.
We describe a typical case of apical ballooning syndrome in an octogenarian female patient with left ventricular wall motion abnormality on electrocardiography, whose ventricular function returned to normal. The patient has allergic rhinitis and had used nasal decongestant excessively a few hours prior to the episode of pain.
To evaluate the therapeutic effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) and recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) on sulfur mustard (SM) induced toxicity in dogs.
Ten dogs were used as the animal model. Control group had four dogs while treatment group had six. Half an hour after subcutaneously injected with 12 mg/kg (body weight) of SM, the dogs of the treatment group were treated by rhEPO, rhG-CSF and other medicines. General examinations of blood were measured before injecting SM and were continually watched for a week after poisoning.
Three dogs in control group died in three days after poisoning, dogs in treatment group all survived. WBC of the control group decreased significantly 3 days after poisoning. RBC of the control group had a slight increase at first, then came down. While WBC and RBC of treatment group remained constant. LYM of both groups descended notably right after poisoning, especially in control group. Two days after poisoning, RC in treatment group began to rise and remained at high level for about a week. No obvious changes of RC in control group were found.
The use of rhEPO and rhG-CSF after SM exposure can stimulate the growth of the erythrocyte, reticulocyte and leucocyte in dogs. Therefore, rhEPO and rhG-CSF may be significant assistant drugs in future experiment of SM.
Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a lipophilic solvent rapidly absorbed and metabolized via oxidation and conjugation to a variety of metabolites that cause toxicity to several internal targets. Increases in liver weight (hepatomegaly) have been reported to occur quickly in rodents after TCE exposure, with liver tumor induction reported in mice after long-term exposure. An integrated dataset for gavage and inhalation TCE exposure and oral data for exposure to two of its oxidative metabolites (TCA and DCA) was used, in combination with an updated and more accurate physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, to examine the question as to whether the presence of TCA in the liver is responsible for TCE-induced hepatomegaly in mice. The updated PBPK model was used to help discern the quantitative contribution of metabolites to this effect. The update of the model was based on a detailed evaluation of predictions from previously published models and additional preliminary analyses based on gas uptake inhalation data in mice. The parameters of the updated model were calibrated using Bayesian methods with an expanded pharmacokinetic database consisting of oral, inhalation, and iv studies of TCE administration as well as studies of TCE metabolites in mice. The dose-response relationships for hepatomegaly derived from the multi-study database showed that the proportionality of dose to response for TCE- and DCA-induced hepatomegaly is not observed for administered doses of TCA in the studied range. The updated PBPK model was used to make a quantitative comparison of internal dose of metabolized and administered TCA. While the internal dose of TCA predicted by modeling of TCE exposure (i.e., mg TCA/kg-d) showed a linear relationship with hepatomegaly, the slope of the relationship was much greater than that for directly administered TCA. Thus, the degree of hepatomegaly induced per unit of TCA produced through TCE oxidation is greater than that expected per unit of TCA administered directly, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that TCA alone accounts for TCE-induced hepatomegaly. In addition, TCE-induced hepatomegaly showed a much more consistent relationship with PBPK model predictions of total oxidative metabolism than with predictions of TCE area-under-the-curve in blood, consistent with toxicity being induced by oxidative metabolites rather than the parent compound. Therefore, these results strongly suggest that oxidative metabolites in addition to TCA are necessary contributors to TCE-induced liver weight changes in mice.
