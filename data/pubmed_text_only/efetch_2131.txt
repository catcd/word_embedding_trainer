Propylthiouracil (PTU) has recently been observed to be associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive small vessel vasculitis, resulting in crescentic glomerulonephritis and, infrequently, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). We describe a case of a 23-year-old pregnant woman who developed a perinuclear ANCA and antimyeloperoxidase-positive small vessel vasculitis manifesting as DAH and crescentic glomerulonephritis after she began taking PTU. An open lung biopsy was consistent with pulmonary capillaritis. She responded to corticosteroid therapy and discontinuation of PTU. DAH can be caused by pulmonary capillaritis, bland hemorrhage, or diffuse alveolar damage. To our knowledge, this represents the first documentation of an underlying pulmonary capillaritis in a case of PTU-induced DAH.
A 65-year-old, previously healthy man developed acute renal failure, severe thrombocytopenia and hepatic icterus after a small dose of mefenamic acid (Parkemed). Drug-dependent antibodies reacting against platelets could be identified as the most probable cause for this acute and rapidly reversible disorder. A concomitant hemolytic reaction was not observed and accordingly no drug-dependent red cell antibodies could be demonstrated. The drug-specific antibodies were found only during the acute phase using the platelet immunofluorescence test and a solid-phase immunoassay but not with the monoclonal antibody specific immobilization of platelet antigens assay. After discontinuation of the drug the patient steadily improved and fully recovered until day 22 after admission and drug removal. The clinical course strongly suggests that drug-dependent antibodies against mefenamic acid and/or its metabolites reacting by immune complex mechanism were responsible not only for the thrombocytopenia but also for the renal and hepatic failure.
Etomidate 0.2 mg/kg was used as an intravenous hypnotic to induce anesthesia in 198 children. If proved to be a safe and effective agent, with no appreciable side-effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. The main problems in use were a high incidence (27%) of pain after injection, and a 10% incidence of significant myoclonia. In addition, 0.2 mg/kg was assessed as an inadequate induction dose of etomidate in unpremedicated children.
This article describes the incidence of sexual dysfunction in 30 patients subjected to long-term treatment by paroxetine in dependence on the P 450 CYP 2D6 isoenzyme metabolic status. Measured on the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX; McGahuey, Delgado, & Gelenberg, 1999), the incidence of sexual dysfunction in patients converted to CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers was markedly higher compared with patients who had no history of such conversion, a difference that reached the level of statistical significance. Our article discusses the incidence of sexual dysfunction in connection with reduced CYP 2D6 capacity.
Three cases of neonatal acute retention were associated with convulsions and heavy sedation. Inhibition of micturition may be due to diazepam-induced depression of the nervous system, in association with other anticonvulsants drugs.
It has been shown that mice deficient in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene are resistant to cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization and methamphetamine (METH)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. The present study was undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that nNOS has a major role in dopamine (DA)- but not serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT)-mediated effects of psychostimulants. The response of nNOS knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice to the psychomotor-stimulating and neurotoxic effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; "Ecstasy") and METH were investigated. Repeated administration of MDMA for 5 days resulted in psychomotor sensitization in both WT and nNOS KO mice, while repeated administration of METH caused psychomotor sensitization in WT but not in KO mice. Sensitization to both MDMA and METH was persistent for 40 days in WT mice, but not in nNOS KO mice. These findings suggest that the induction of psychomotor sensitization to MDMA and METH is NO independent and NO dependent, respectively, while the persistence of sensitization to both drugs is NO dependent. For the neurochemical studies, a high dose of MDMA caused marked depletion of 5-HT in several brain regions of both WT and KO mice, suggesting that the absence of the nNOS gene did not afford protection against MDMA-induced depletion of 5-HT. Striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity caused by high doses of MDMA and METH in WT mice was partially prevented in KO mice administered with MDMA, but it was fully precluded in KO mice administered with METH. The differential response of nNOS KO mice to the behavioral and neurotoxic effects of MDMA and METH suggests that the nNOS gene is required for the expression and persistence of DA-mediated effects of METH and MDMA, while 5-HT-mediated effects of MDMA (induction of sensitization and 5-HT depletion) are not dependent on nNOS.
Only limited studies have been done on the effects of long-term cocaine use on the human heart, and the results remain controversial. In this study, we examined and compared the diastolic function of non-cocaine users and chronic cocaine users to reveal the impact of long-term cocaine use on the human heart.
Two-dimensional echocardiogram and pulsed Doppler transmitral blood flow pattern were obtained from 138 recruited study participants with different cocaine histories. The indices of cardiac structure and function were measured from the echocardiogram of each participant. Student's t-test was used to compare the average echocardiographic measurements of the non-cocaine user group and the cocaine user group. Multivariate regression analysis was deployed to eliminate the effects of age, gender, blood pressure, and HIV infection on the functional measurements of the two groups.
The cocaine user group had a significantly longer average deceleration time than did the non-cocaine user group (208.1 +/- 38.2 vs. 167.5 +/- 39.1 ms, P<0.001). A linear association existed between the deceleration time and the log-transformed duration of cocaine use (beta=0.00351, S.E.=0.00104, P=0.001). Cocaine users in this study were approximately five times more likely to have an elongated deceleration time (>200 ms) than were non-users (OR, 4.799; 95% CI, 1.000-23.044; P=0.05). No significant differences were observed in the other measured diastolic functional parameters, such as isovolumic ventricular relaxation time, E wave, A wave, and E/A ratio.
Long-term cocaine use is linked to decline in diastolic function.
The case of a 78-year-old patient with cancer-related pain and additionally mixed-pain syndrome is presented. Pain therapy with buprenorphine TTS 210 microg/h every 3 days was sufficient in the beginning, later the therapy was changed because of increasing problems of tape fixing during fever periods under chemotherapy to a continuous infusion of buprenorphine intravenously via an external medication pump. During the course of therapy it became necessary to increase the dose to 99.9 mg/day buprenorphine. Under this medication a sufficient pain reduction (median NRS 2-3) over a period of 135 days could be achieved. At the same time the patient was vigilant and cooperative without signs of intoxication until the end of life at home in the presence of his family.If no signs of intoxication occur under extreme opioid therapy and a sufficient pain therapy can be achieved, a rotation to another opioid is not necessary. However, outpatient palliative care requires a frequent adaptation to the individually varying opioid demand of the patient and time-consuming nursing care.
Methamphetamine (MAP) dissipates proton gradients across the membranes of synaptic vesicles, enhances cytoplasmic dopamine (DA) concentrations, and causes calcium-independent, nonvesicular DA release into synapses. MAP is taken into the cytosol by the dopamine transporter (DAT) on the synaptic terminals of DA neurons, and endogenous DA is concurrently released through the transporter by carrier exchange mechanisms, resulting in a robust increase in DA concentration in the synaptic clefts. The enhanced DA release through DAT by MAP is the main mechanism for the reinforcing effects of MAP. The complexes of alpha-synuclein and DAT facilitate membrane clustering of the DAT, thereby accelerating DA uptake in vitro. alpha-Synuclein has been shown to be overexpressed in the midbrain DA neurons of chronic cocaine abusers. The present study was performed to study the association between the alpha-synuclein gene polymorphisms and MAP psychosis/dependence in Japanese population. Since the T10A7 polymorphic site at the 5' end of the noncoding exon 1' in the alpha-synuclein gene is highly polymorphic, we analyzed the noncoding exon 1' and intron 1, including this polymorphic site by sequencing. We confirmed four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 1.38 kbp of the T10A7 polymorphic site. No significant difference was found in genotype or allele frequencies in the T10A7 polymorphic site between MAP psychotic/dependent and control subjects. We found significant association between three SNPs in the vicinity of this polymorphic site in intron 1 and MAP psychosis/dependence in female subjects, but not in males. These results suggest an association of the alpha-synuclein gene polymorphisms with MAP psychosis/dependence in our female subjects. Further analyses are necessary to clarify the gender difference, by using a larger sample size and/or different ethnic groups, as well as functional variations in the alpha-synuclein gene.
Aspirin is known to produce a reversible loss of hearing that can be as great as 40 dB, depending upon the dose and the individual subject. Here we show that aspirin-induced losses exacerbate the temporary hearing loss induced by exposure to intense sound. EXPOSUREs that ordinarily produce about 14 dB of temporary threshold shift (TTS) will produce about 18-27 dB of TTS if the listener has been taking 3.9 g of aspirin for the past two days or more. A lesser dose or a shorter duration of use produces a smaller, or no, increment in temporary hearing loss. This greater TTS, and an apparent prolongation of recovery from exposure, make chronic aspirin use ill-advised for people routinely exposed to intense sounds.
2500 Hz, 10 min, varying intensity. TTS frequency: 3550 Hz. Psychophysical method: 2IFC, adaptive.
Glomerular diseases are leading causes of end-stage renal diseases worldwide. They are considered to be consequences of injury primarily to the three types of glomerular cells. Differential diagnosis typically relies on invasive biopsy findings. We expected that injuries of different glomerular cells would cause different changes in urinary proteome. The goal of this study was to identify differential urinary proteins distinguishing between injuries of different glomerular cells before significant histopathologic changes. Adriamycin nephropathy and Thy1.1 glomerulonephritis were employed as models with different primary impaired cells. ConA-enriched urinary glycoproteome on day3 were profiled by gel-free shotgun tandem mass spectrometry, and compared with self-healthy controls to identify differential urinary proteins for each model. By comparing the changes of the differential proteins between these two models, we identified 39 proteins with different directions of changes, which may potentially be useful in differentiation; and 7 proteins with the same direction of changes, which may be potential indicators of early renal damage. These differential proteins were of several origins: plasma proteins, proteins with urine or kidney specificity, proteins without tissue-specificity (mainly inflammatory mediators) etc. Our results may help better understand the effects of injuries of different glomerular cells at the initial stage, and lead to the discovery of novel early diagnostic markers for human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN) which have the same primary impaired cells with adriamycin nephropathy and Thy1.1 glomerulonephritis, respectively.
Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is of interest due to its role in prevention and therapy of degenerative diseases as cancer and aging. However, depending on its concentration and cell type studied, resveratrol activity appears conflicting. It exerts antioxidant action, as a scavenger of free radicals and as promoter of antioxidant enzyme activity, but resveratrol acts also as a pro-oxidant. Here we present experimental and theoretical studies for resveratrol and two methoxy-derivatives found in plants, pterostilbene and 3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene. We show that both methoxy-derivatives induce less DNA damage than resveratrol. The protective effects of the three molecules against oxidative DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment were analyzed on mammalian cells in vitro. Our data show for the first time that methoxylated derivatives of resveratrol are very efficient in reducing DNA damage: using the same concentration of the three molecules we obtain a relative reduction of 85.5% (pterostilbene), 43.7% (trimethoxystilbene) and 21.1% (resveratrol). Analysis of the crystal structures of pterostilbene and 3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene, compared to resveratrol, show fewer intermolecular interactions and a lack of planarity, due to packing forces, which is confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We also describe the results of DFT calculations (including water solvent effects) in which the three stilbene species scavenge the hydroxyl radical (associated with the H2O2 insult).
Nifedipine, 30 mg/day for 4 weeks, was compared to placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, as an additional drug added to the usual treatment of 14 patients with bronchial asthma. Nifedipine did not significantly change peak expiratory flow rates or subjective symptoms like cough, sputum, wheezing, shortness of breath, or disturbed sleep. Nifedipine did not decrease the number of salbutamol rotacaps inhaled per day. Arterial blood pressure significantly decreased (p less than 0.01) after nifedipine treatment, and side effects (headache and flushing) were not uncommon. In this study, long-term treatment with nifedipine had essentially no effect on subjective symptoms at peak expiratory flow rates.
We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy, an experimental model of glomerular disease. Therefore, we examined whether recombinant human (rh) IGF-I is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy. The glomerulopathy was induced by seven serial injections of PAN over 12 wk. Experimental animals (n = 6) received rhIGF-I, 400 micrograms/d, whereas control rats (n = 6) received the vehicle. rhIGF-I improved weight gain by 14% (p < 0.05), without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with renal disease. Urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhIGF-I treatment in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy. After 12 wk, the inulin clearance was higher in rhIGF-I-treated rats, 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 mL/min/100 g of body weight in untreated PAN nephropathy animals, p < 0.05. The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced glomerular hypertrophy or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, or renal cortical malondialdehyde content. In rats with PAN nephropathy, administration of rhIGF-I increased IGF-I and GH receptor gene expression, without altering the steady state level of IGF-I receptor mRNA. In normal rats with intact kidneys, rhIGF-I administration (n = 4) did not alter weight gain, blood pressure, proteinuria, GFR, glomerular planar area, renal cortical malondialdehyde content, or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage, compared with untreated animals (n = 4). rhIGF-I treatment reduced the steady state renal IGF-I mRNA level but did not modify gene expression of the IGF-I or GH receptors. We conclude that: 1) administration of rhIGF-I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy and 2) unlike rhGH, long-term use of rhIGF-I does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model.
To identify novel genes involved in glioma progression we performed suppression subtractive hybridization combined with cDNA array analysis on 4 patients with primary low-grade gliomas of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II that recurred as secondary glioblastomas (WHO grade IV). Eight genes showing differential expression between primary and recurrent tumors in 3 of the 4 patients were selected for further analysis using real-time reverse transcription-PCR on a series of 10 pairs of primary low-grade and recurrent high-grade gliomas as well as 42 astrocytic gliomas of different WHO grades. These analyses revealed that 5 genes, i.e., AMOG (ATP1B2, 17p13.1), APOD (3q26.2-qter), DMXL1 (5q23.1) DRR1 (TU3A, 3p14.2) and PSD3 (KIAA09428/HCA67/EFA6R, 8p22), were expressed at significantly lower levels in secondary glioblastomas as compared to diffuse astrocytomas of WHO grade II. In addition, AMOG, DRR1 and PSD3 transcript levels were significantly lower in primary glioblastomas than in diffuse astrocytomas. Treatment of glioma cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A resulted in increased expression of AMOG and APOD transcripts. Sequencing of sodium bisulfite-modified DNA demonstrated AMOG promoter hypermethylation in the glioma cell lines and 1 primary anaplastic astrocytoma with low AMOG expression. Taken together, we identified interesting novel candidate genes that likely contribute to glioma progression and provide first evidence for a role of epigenetic silencing of AMOG in malignant glioma cells.
Reduced expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in chronic liver disease can reduce hepatic perfusion and accelerate fibrosis. The relationship between eNOS expression and liver fibrogenesis remains unclear. We investigated whether L-arginine attenuated chronic liver fibrosis through eNOS expression. Chronic liver injury was induced by administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) to mice for 8 weeks. 5-Methylisothiourea hemisulphate (SMT), an iNOS inhibitor, or L-arginine, a NOS substrate were injected subcutaneously. CCl(4)-induced hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress and accumulation of collagen were detected in the liver. The expression levels of inducible NOS (iNOS) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) activity in the liver after CCl(4) treatment were increased but eNOS expression and activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity were decreased. Both SMT and L-arginine effectively reduced CCl(4) induced oxidative stress and collagen formation, but L-arginine showed a significantly greater suppression of collagen formation, iNOS expression and NF-kappaB activity. L-arginine also restored the level of eNOS and AP-1 activity. L-arginine was more effective than SMT in suppressing liver fibrosis. L-arginine might improve NO production which facilitates hepatic blood flow and thus retards liver fibrogenesis. Our results showed that the reduced eNOS expression in CCl(4)-treated mice was reversed by L-arginine. Furthermore, L-arginine also reversed the reduced AP-1 activity, an eNOS promoter.
Catecholamines participate in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension and liver fibrosis through alpha1-adrenoceptors. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of norepinephrine (NE) on human hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which exert vasoactive, inflammatory, and fibrogenic actions in the injured liver. Adrenoceptor expression was assessed in human HSC by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was studied in fura-2-loaded cells. Cell contraction was studied by assessing wrinkle formation and myosin light chain II (MLC II) phosphorylation. Cell proliferation and collagen-alpha1(I) expression were assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation and quantitative PCR, respectively. NF-kappaB activation was assessed by luciferase reporter gene and p65 nuclear translocation. Chemokine secretion was assessed by ELISA. Normal human livers expressed alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors, which were markedly upregulated in livers with advanced fibrosis. Activated human HSC expressed alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors. NE induced multiple rapid [Ca2+]i oscillations (Ca2+ spikes). Prazosin (alpha1-blocker) completely prevented NE-induced Ca2+ spikes, whereas propranolol (nonspecific beta-blocker) partially attenuated this effect. NE caused phosphorylation of MLC II and cell contraction. In contrast, NE did not affect cell proliferation or collagen-alpha1(I) expression. Importantly, NE stimulated the secretion of inflammatory chemokines (RANTES and interleukin-8) in a dose-dependent manner. Prazosin blocked NE-induced chemokine secretion. NE stimulated NF-kappaB activation. BAY 11-7082, a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor, blocked NE-induced chemokine secretion. We conclude that NE stimulates NF-kappaB and induces cell contraction and proinflammatory effects in human HSC. Catecholamines may participate in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension and liver fibrosis by targeting HSC.
Persisting neurologic damage rarely follows lithium salt therapy. We encountered two cases and found 15 others in the literature. There are usually signs of damage at multiple sites in the nervous system, but cerebellar features tend to be most prominent. The patient's sex and age, the lithium ion dosage, and the maximum blood levels of lithium ion do not correlate well with the persistence of damage. Individual susceptibility may be important. Severe lithium ion intoxication may occur in the first one or two months after the drug is introduced but can arise even after several years of satisfactory maintenance therapy at a constant dosage. Infection, dehydration, deteriorating renal function, or the addition of other drugs to the regimen may precipitate acute toxicity. Neurologic damage can occur despite low plasma levels of lithium ion. The patient's clinical state may be the best indication of intoxication.
Pregnant Sprague-Dawley CD rats were administered phenytoin by gavage on days 7-18 of gestation in doses of 0, 100, 150 and 200 mg/kg. At 46-53 days of age rat offspring in each litter were divided with half tested in a Biel water maze and half in a new, more complex water maze. On the first test day all rats were tested in a straight channel. On subsequent days rats received 5 trials in the Biel maze or 6 trials in the new maze in path A, followed by 6 trials in path B (in which the start and goal positions were reversed). Analyses showed that phenytoin increased offspring mortality shortly after birth at the highest dose, but did not affect growth at any dose. Phenytoin had no effects on straight channel swimming performance. Analyses of maze performance showed that both mazes differentiated phenytoin offspring from controls, but that the new, more complex maze distinguished the groups more definitively. Maze errors also showed a clear dose-response relationship in the new maze, while no such distinctions were seen in the Biel maze. It was concluded that the new maze design may offer significant gains over the Biel maze in terms of detection sensitivity to prenatally induced CNS injury.
Several structurally different tumor promoters altered to various degrees both glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17) activities in mouse epidermis in vivo. At 5 h after their application to the skin, the complete tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and the stage 2 promoter mezerein were the most potent in inhibiting GSH peroxidase activity and inducing ODC activity. In comparison, the effects of anthralin, phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, benzoyl peroxide, H2O2, and phorbol-12,13-dibenzoate were much smaller, whereas the nontumor promoter phorbol, the hyperplastic agent ethyl phenylpropiolate, and the stage 1 promoter 4-O-methyl TPA did not alter GSH peroxidase and ODC activities. Various treatments including i.p. injections of 40 micrograms of Na2SeO3 and 100 mumol of GSH and/or topical applications of 40 mumol of D-alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) 20 or 15 min, respectively, before tumor promoter treatment inhibited in an additive manner the effects of either TPA or mezerein on both GSH peroxidase activity and ODC induction. Moreover, these Na2SeO3, GSH, and/or vitamin E treatments inhibited in the same additive manner the tumor-promoting activity of TPA in the initiation-promotion protocol. However, when tested in the 2-stage promotion protocol with 4 doses of TPA followed by twice weekly applications of mezerein, Na2SeO3 plus vitamin E and GSH plus vitamin E treatments inhibited remarkably the tumor-promoting activity of mezerein but were ineffective in the first stage of promotion. The sequence and magnitude for the effects of 7,12-dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene (DMBA) on GSH peroxidase and ODC activities were very different from those of the tumor promoters. In contrast with their antitumor-promoting activity, the treatments with Na2SeO3 plus vitamin E and GSH plus vitamin E failed to inhibit the carcinogenicity of a single large dose of DMBA and even enhanced the induction of skin tumors by repeated applications of subcarcinogenic doses of DMBA. These results suggest that the promoting component of DMBA carcinogenesis may be different from that of TPA. Moreover, the anticarcinogenicity of Na2SeO3, GSH, and vitamin E may be linked to their ability to facilitate or enhance the activity of the natural GSH-dependent antioxidant protective system of the epidermal cells during the later stages of skin tumor promotion.
Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to induce proliferation of cardiac myocytes. To examine the role of Ang II in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, isoproterenol was infused subcutaneously into 9-week-old male Wistar rats at 4.2 mg/kg/day for 7 days. Infusion of isoproterenol increased LV weight and Ang II concentrations in plasma and in LV tissue. In anephric rats, LV weight and tissue Ang II were increased similarly, but plasma Ang II was not changed by isoproterenol. Concomitant oral administration of trandolapril and isoproterenol prevented increases in both LV Ang II and LV weight. Treatment with hydralazine decreased blood pressure in a similar way as trandolapril but did not affect either LV weight or LV Ang II. Plasma Ang II was not decreased by either trandolapril or hydralazine when administered in combination with isoproterenol. These results suggest that cardiac tissue Ang II regulates myocyte growth in isoproterenol-induced LV hypertrophy, and the reduction of Ang II partly explains the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy by the converting enzyme inhibitor.
Dichlorvos (dimethyl 2,2-dichlorovinyl phosphate) was administered orally to German Shorthair Pointer dogs at approximately 60 mg/kg (twice the usual clinical dose). Plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase (ChE) was monitored prior to, 90 min, and 180 min post-ingestion. 2-PAM (20 mg/kg IV) and atropine sulfate (0.022 mg/kg IM) were administered 90 min after the dichlorvos to paired treated and control dogs. The telemetered electrocardiographic (ECG) signal was analyzed by a Vagal Tone Monitor (VTM) to yield mean heart period (msec) and an estimate of the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (V in natural log values of msec2) for five min intervals. Dichlorvos did not cause cholinomimetic symptoms even though blood cholinesterase was significantly inhibited (plasma -51.3% and erythrocyte -43.7%). The atropine sulfate treatment resulted in the expected vagolytic effects in both the control and the dichlorvos treated dogs, but the atropine effects were attenuated in the latter dogs. Three weeks later, ChE activity was not significantly depressed in the dichlorvos treated dogs, and their V responses to atropine were more similar to the responses in control dogs.
Calcium antagonists such as nifedipine have been shown to lower blood pressure alone or in combination with other drugs in mild, moderate and severe hypertension. It is likely that the antihypertensive action depends on modification of calcium dependent coupling of excitation and contraction in peripheral vascular smooth muscle. Acute effects of nifedipine are associated with reflex mediated increases in sympathetic tone and plasma renin activity while in the long term these effects are less prominent. Nifedipine does not interfere with depressor mechanisms mediated by prostaglandins or peripheral vascular beta 2 receptors. In contrast peripheral pressor mechanisms including those mediated by angiotensin II and noradrenaline are antagonised. The long term efficacy of nifedipine in hypertension probably depends on its direct vasodilator effect, the preservation of depressor mechanisms and attenuation of reflex responses and direct and indirect pressor mechanisms.
The antineoplastic drug sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is a multikinase inhibitor that targets the serine-threonine kinase B-Raf as well as several tyrosine kinases. Given the numerous molecular targets of sorafenib, there are several potential anticancer mechanisms of action, including induction of apoptosis, cytostasis, and antiangiogenesis. We observed that sorafenib has broad activity in viability assays in several human tumor cell lines but selectively induces apoptosis in only some lines. Sorafenib was found to decrease Mcl-1 levels in most cell lines tested, but this decrease did not correlate with apoptotic sensitivity. Sorafenib slows cell cycle progression and prevents irradiated cells from reaching and accumulating at G2-M. In synchronized cells, sorafenib causes a reversible G1 delay, which is associated with decreased levels of cyclin D1, Rb, and phosphorylation of Rb. Although sorafenib does not affect intrinsic radiosensitivity using in vitro colony formation assays, it significantly reduces colony size. In HCT116 xenograft tumor growth delay experiments in mice, sorafenib alters radiation response in a schedule-dependent manner. Radiation treatment followed sequentially by sorafenib was found to be associated with the greatest tumor growth delay. This study establishes a foundation for clinical testing of sequential fractionated radiation followed by sorafenib in gastrointestinal and other malignancies.
Downbeat nystagmus developed in a 67-year-old hypomagnesemic woman while she was receiving lithium carbonate for depression. This nystagmus abated each time lithium carbonate therapy was withdrawn, and no alternative causes of nystagmus were demonstrated. However, this nystagmus occurred despite serum lithium carbonate levels in the nontoxic range. Total-body magnesium deficiency may have enhanced the toxic effect of lithium carbonate on cerebellomedullary connections.
To observe the efficacy of electrical stimulation in treatment of overactive bladder (OAB).
Patients (n = 60) with overactive bladder were randomly divided into 2 groups. Electrical stimulation group (n = 35) used an instrument for electrical stimulation through a special vagina or rectum probe transfer current (8-70 mA), for 20 min, qd, for 20-30 times. Medical group (n = 25) received oral tolterodine 2 mg, bid, for 2-4 weeks.
The total effective rate and cure rate were 74%, 37% in electrical stimulation group and 76%, 40% in medical group, respectively, showing no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). While patients' satisfactory rate was significantly higher in electrical stimulation group than in medical group (P < 0.05). Side effects were more commonly seen with tolterodine.
Electrical nerve stimulation is effective and safe for overactive bladder. Further studies are needed to show the long term efficacy and cost-effectiveness.
Methamphetamine (METH) is a drug of abuse, causing neurotoxic effects in mammals. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the underlying mechanisms of METH-induced toxicity, based on neurochemical/neuroanatomical changes. However, the pharmacokinetic properties of METH in the METH-induced neurotoxic model have not yet been evaluated. Thus, we investigated plasma and tissue levels of METH in the METH-induced neurotoxic model. As a result, when METH is administered multiply (5 mg/kg 4 times at 2-h intervals) in male Wistar rats, plasma METH levels at the third and forth injections were significantly higher than those at the first. The tissue distributions of METH in the brain as well as in the kidney were significantly decreased in the third injections, suggesting the importance of decreased transport of METH into tissues. Alternatively, one week after the establishment of METH-induced neurotoxicity, plasma levels of METH were back to normal, although METH levels in brain microdialysates were significantly higher than those in normal animals. These results suggest that the altered pharmacokinetic properties of METH, due to the abnormal membrane transport/disposition of METH into both central and peripheral tissues, might partially affect the emergence of METH-induced neurotoxicity.
