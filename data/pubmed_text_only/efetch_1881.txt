The polymorphism of a restriction endonuclease site has been used for antenatal diagnosis of sickle-cell disease. In a normal person, the beta-globin gene was contained in a Hpa I-digested D.N.A. fragment 7.6 kilobases (kb) in length. In a family where the sickle gene was contained in a variant 13.0 kb fragment, restriction endonuclease mapping was used for antenatal diagnosis. The D.N.A. from amniotic-fluid cells produced both the 7.6 and the 13.0 bk beta-globin gene fragments, indicating the diagnosis of sickle-cell trait. This confirmed the diagnosis reached after investigation of a 100% sample of fetal blood. The method is sensitive and can be performed with cells obtained from 15 ml of uncultured amniotic fluid. This approach may prove useful in antenatal diagnosis of other genetic disorders.
The present study examined the effects of daily treatment with a subconvulsant dose (50 mg/kg) of cocaine or lidocaine on susceptibility to seizures induced by cross-injections of the same dose of the other local anesthetic, and to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or N-methyl-DL-aspartate (NMDLA) in ddY mice. Repeated administration of 50 mg/kg cocaine caused the development of sensitization to cocaine-induced seizures during an initial 3 or 4 days, followed by the development of tolerance on days 4-6. The same dose of lidocaine, however, produced little or no seizure activity following repeated administration. In contrast, when injected 24 hr after 2-4 days of cocaine treatment, 50 mg/kg lidocaine produced severe seizures. Interestingly, this cross-sensitization from cocaine to lidocaine diminished upon further cocaine treatment. In contrast, treatment with lidocaine for 2-6 days had no effect on subsequent changes in seizure susceptibility following repeated cocaine injections. Neither treatment with cocaine nor lidocaine for 2 or 5 days influenced susceptibility to seizures induced by a challenge injection of PTZ (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or NMDLA (300 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 hr after treatment. HPLC analyses revealed that the cocaine treatment paradigm used in these studies increased the levels of the polyamines, putrescine and spermidine, in mouse brain, while lidocaine treatment had no effect on cerebral polyamine levels. These results suggest that there are differences in the neural mechanisms underlying the convulsant properties of cocaine and lidocaine in ddY mice.
Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2) is expressed in malignant glioma. Previously we noted that C6 glioma cells overexpressing NOS2 displayed chemoresistance against 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and other chloroethylnitrosourea derivatives with carbamoylating action. Herein we report experimental evidence supporting the contention that this NOS2 effect is mediated, at least in part, by S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a potent antioxidant derived from interaction of NO and glutathione. Out of three NO donors tested, only GSNO was effective in protecting glioma cells against BCNU cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the protective effect of GSNO, similar to that of NOS2, was confined to carbamoylating, but not alkylating action. Experimental manipulations that were expected to increase or decrease cellular GSNO stores, as confirmed by immunocytochemical staining using a GSNO-specific antibody and HPLC analysis of GSNO contents in culture medium, led respectively to enhanced or reduced chemoresistance against carbamoylating cytotoxicity. Finally, neocuproine, a selective cuprous ion chelator known to neutralize GSNO actions, abolished NOS2-mediated chemoresistance against carbamoylating agents. Our results reveal a novel action of NOS2/GSNO that may potentially contribute to the development of chemoresistance against BCNU, which remains a mainstay in chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme.
The authors assess the mortality from the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) based on an exhaustive review of 202 published case reports, including a differential assessment of risk factors and protective factors. The results indicate a significant (p less than .05) decrease in mortality since 1984 (11.6% vs. 25% before 1984), which occurs independently of the therapeutic use of dopamine agonists and dantrolene. A significantly (p less than .001) lower rate of mortality from haloperidol-induced NMS (7%) and a high rate of mortality (38.5%) among patients with organic brain syndrome were also found. Myoglobinemia and renal failure are strong predictors of mortality, representing a mortality risk of approximately 50%. The authors discuss the implications of these findings.
Bromocriptine in high doses (up to 100 mg per day) was administered to 14 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease whose disorder was progressing despite optimum treatment with levodopa combined with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa). In 10, bromocriptine (mean dose, 57 mg) induced a statistically significant (P less than 0.01) improvement in rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia, gait disturbance and total score. In seven patients levodopa with carbidopa was completely replaced by bromocriptine (mean dose, 70 mg), with improvement in four. Adverse effects were similar to those observed with levodopa and carbidopa, except that in individual patients abnormal involuntary movements and diurnal oscillations in performance (on-off effect) were decreased whereas orthostatic hypotension and mental changes were increased. Bromocriptine appears to be a major new agent in Parkinson's disease that is especially promising in patients no longer responding to levodopa.
Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a key regulator of nitric oxide production. Elevations of ADMA have previously been associated with endothelial dysfunction in pre-eclamptic women. ADMA is degraded mainly by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), which is also expressed in placental tissue. Therefore, we measured placental DDAH expression and activity in pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancies in order to determine whether impairment of this enzyme in the pre-eclamptic placenta could contribute to elevations of ADMA levels in these women.
ADMA plasma levels were measured by LC-MS/MS in 18 pre-eclamptic patients and 28 controls. Placental DDAH activity was determined by measuring the degradation of [(2)H(6)]-labeled ADMA in tissue homogenates from placental biopsies in 15 women with pre-eclampsia and 16 controls. Placental mRNA expression of DDAH 1, DDAH 2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and protein-arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) was determined in tissue biopsies by RT-PCR.
Placental DDAH activity was almost undetectable in pre-eclampsia, and it was significantly higher in controls. ADMA plasma levels were higher in pre-eclampsia as compared to normal pregnancies (0.51±0.15μmol/l vs. 0.42±0.07μmol/l; p=0.005), and the difference between maternal and fetal ADMA levels (feto-maternal ADMA gradient) was lower in pre-eclampsia (0.63±0.20μmol/l vs. 0.80±0.18μmol/l; p=0.02). Furthermore, mRNA expression levels of DDAH 2 were significantly lower in pre-eclamptic women (p=0.04), while PRMT1 expression levels were the same. In pre-eclampsia, we found only weak correlations between maternal ADMA levels and DDAH 1 (r=-0.41; p=0.22) and DDAH 2 expressions (r=-0.45; p=0.17) but a slightly stronger correlation between DDAH 2 expression and feto-maternal ADMA gradient (r=0.60; p=0.07).
Decreased DDAH activity in the pre-eclamptic placenta might contribute to elevated ADMA levels in these patients.
Aspirin and statins are both effective for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), but their combined use has not been well studied.
To perform a cost-utility analysis of the effects of aspirin therapy, statin therapy, combination therapy with both drugs, and no pharmacotherapy for the primary prevention of CHD events in men.
Markov model.
Published literature.
Middle-aged men without a history of cardiovascular disease at 6 levels of 10-year risk for CHD (2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 15%, and 25%).
Lifetime.
Third-party payer.
Low-dose aspirin, a statin, both drugs as combination therapy, or no therapy.
Cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
For 45-year-old men who do not smoke, are not hypertensive, and have a 10-year risk for CHD of 7.5%, aspirin was more effective and less costly than no treatment. The addition of a statin to aspirin therapy produced an incremental cost-utility ratio of 56,200 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with aspirin alone.
Excess risk for hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin, risk for CHD, the cost of statins, and the disutility of taking medication had important effects on the cost-utility ratios.
Several input parameters, particularly adverse event rates and utility values, are supported by limited empirical data. Results are applicable to middle-aged men only.
Compared with no treatment, aspirin is less costly and more effective for preventing CHD events in middle-aged men whose 10-year risk for CHD is 7.5% or higher. The addition of a statin to aspirin therapy becomes more cost-effective when the patient's 10-year CHD risk before treatment is higher than 10%.
Four patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus receiving antiretroviral treatment and high doses of methadone (>200 mg/day) presented with several syncopal episodes. A significant prolongation of the QTc interval was detected in all of them, and in 3 patients, > or =1 episode of Torsades de Pointes was recorded. The sequence of events in these cases suggests that high doses of methadone caused QT prolongation and provided the substrate for syncope and Torsades de Pointes.
We describe the identification and clinical presentation of four individuals from three unrelated families with hemizygous deletions involving the DPYD gene at chromosome 1p21.3. DPYD encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of pyrimidine bases. All four individuals described met diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder with severe speech delay. Patient 1's deletion was originally reported in 2008, and more detailed clinical information is provided. Subsequently, this male individual was found to have a missense mutation in the X-linked PTCHD1 autism susceptibility gene, which may also contribute to the phenotype. Patients 2 and 3 are siblings with a novel deletion encompassing the DPYD gene. In their mother, the genomic region deleted from chromosome 1p21.3 was inserted into chromosome 10. A fourth proband had a novel 10-kb intragenic deletion of exon 6 of the DPYD gene detected on a higher resolution microarray. Our study suggests that hemizygous deletions involving the DPYD locus present with variable phenotypes which can include speech delay and autistic features, and may also be influenced by additional mutations in other genes, issues which need to be considered in genetic counseling.
Crizotinib (Xalkori), the first inhibitor of both anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and c-Met receptor kinases, has been approved in the United States, Korea, and other countries for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This approval came within just 4 years of the discovery of rearrangements in the ALK gene in a subset of patients with NSCLC. Oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily showed excellent efficacy in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, with objective response rates of 61% and 51% in ongoing phase I and II studies, respectively. Objective response rates of current standard, single-agent, second-line therapies are less than 10%. Median progression-free survival was 10 months (95% confidence interval, 8.2-14.7) in the phase I study expanded cohort and has yet to be reached in the phase II study; progression-free survival with current therapies is less than 3 months. Crizotinib was well tolerated; grade 1/2 gastrointestinal toxicity and visual disturbances were the most common adverse events. Patients in the phase II study reported improvements in fatigue, dyspnea, and cough, based on quality of life assessments. Phase III studies investigating crizotinib for the first- and second-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, versus current standards of care, are ongoing. Crizotinib represents a new standard of care for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and highlights the importance of the role of the pathologist, as molecular profiling becomes a part of initial workups for newly diagnosed patients with NSCLC. This approach will ensure effective individualized treatment for patients with NSCLC.
A small fraction of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases on D-penicillamine treatment may develop antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and symptoms of myasthenia gravis (MG). The mechanism leading to this phenomenon is not known. We have studied the fine antigenic specificities of the anti-AChR antibodies in 19 D-penicillamine-induced MG (pen-MG) patients and compared them with those of antibodies from 204 idiopathic MG patients (the data for 122 obtained from earlier experiments). Antigenic specificities of the circulating antibodies were determined by the capacity of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), against certain determinants on the AChR, to inhibit binding of the serum antibodies to the AChR. Monoclonal antibodies against alpha, beta and gamma subunits were used. The anti-AChR antibody patterns of pen-MG patients were very similar to those of idiopathic MG patients. Antibodies to the main immunogenic region, which is located on the extracellular surface of the alpha-subunit, were the predominant group. The variations of antibody specificities in serial sera collected from individual patients at different times were usually small, as were those of idiopathic MG. These results strongly suggest that the antibody repertoire in the sera of idiopathic and pen-MG patients is very similar.
One hundred and forty-four patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the authors' institution between 1986 and 1989 were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the relationship between the dose-intensity of chemotherapy actually received (RDI) and the prognosis. Preoperative chemotherapy consisted of high-dose methotrexate i.v., cisplatin i.a., and doxorubicin i.v. After surgery "good responder" patients (90% or more tumor necrosis) had a 31-weeks of chemotherapy with the same drugs, while "poor responder" patients (less than 90% tumor necrosis) received a 40 weeks treatment with ifosfamide and etoposide added to the three drugs used preoperatively. Due to delays and dose-reductions, only 17 patients (12%) received the treatment exactly as scheduled by the protocol, 66 (46%) received a dose-intensity between 90 and 99%, and 61 (42%) a dose-intensity between 63 and 89%. At a follow-up ranging between 10 and 13 years, 97 patients (67%) remained continuously free of disease, 45 relapsed, and two died of doxorubicin-induced cardiopathy. The continuous disease-free survival (CDFS) was not related to patients' gender and age, tumor histology, site and size, serum value of alkaline phosphatase, type of surgery and histologic response to chemotherapy. According to the RDI, CDFS resulted significantly higher for those 81 patients who received 90% or more of the scheduled dose-intensity than for those 61 who had less than 90% of the scheduled dose-intensity (76.5% v.s. 57.3%; p<0.02). These results seem to suggest that in neoadjuvant treatment of osteosarcoma the dose-intensity of chemotherapy is crucial for outcome, therefore every effort should be made to avoid reductions of doses and/or delays in performing the cycles of chemotherapy.
Increased apoptosis in the conjunctival epithelium has been observed in experimental murine keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). Topical cyclosporine (CsA) has been noted to reduce conjunctival epithelial apoptosis in chronic canine and human KCS. The purpose of this study is to determine if topical CsA treatment inhibits conjunctival epithelial apoptosis in a murine model of KCS.
Dry eye was induced in 3 groups of C57BL6 mice by subcutaneous injection of scopolamine TID and exposure to an air draft and low-humidity environment for 16 hours per day for 12 days. The dry eye control group received no topical treatment; a second group received 1 microL of 0.05% CsA topically TID (dry eye + CsA); and the third group received 1 microL of the castor oil vehicle of CsA topically TID (dry eye + vehicle). Normal mice were used as untreated controls. After 12 days, the mice were killed, and the right eyes and eyelids were excised, frozen, and cryosectioned. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on conjunctival and corneal samples taken from the left eyes. Apoptosis was detected in frozen sections with the ApopTag (ISOL) In Situ Oligo Ligation Kit, which specifically detects DNA fragmentation. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect activated caspase-3. Conjunctival goblet cell number was counted in tissue sections stained with period acid Schiff (PAS) reagent. These assays were performed on 2 separate sets of mice.
Compared with untreated controls and dry eye mice receiving CsA, the number of ISOL-positive epithelial cells in the bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva was significantly greater in the dry eye control and dry eye mice + vehicle groups (P < 0.01 for both groups). There was no significant difference in the number of ISOL-positive conjunctival epithelial cells between the dry eye control and dry eye + vehicle mice. There was no significant difference in ISOL-positive cells in the corneal epithelium between the untreated controls and the 3 treatment groups. Dry eye + CsA mice showed less activated caspase-3 staining than the dry eye control and the dry eye + vehicle groups. TEM showed loss of superficial differentiated cells and extensive nuclear fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in the dry eye control and dry eye + vehicle groups but not in the dry eye + CsA group. There was significant loss of goblet cells in the bulbar and tarsal conjunctivae of the dry eye control and the dry eye + vehicle groups compared with untreated controls and the dry eye + CsA group.
Topical CsA significantly reduced conjunctival epithelial apoptosis and protected against goblet cell loss in experimental murine KCS. Inhibition of apoptosis appears to be a key mechanism for the therapeutic effect of CsA for KCS.
Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic agent used in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. Toxicities associated with this agent include myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity; however, the genes or genetic determinants that contribute to these toxicities are unknown. We present an unbiased genome-wide approach that incorporates heritability, whole-genome linkage analysis, and linkage-directed association to uncover genetic variants contributing to the sensitivity to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. Cell growth inhibition in 324 Centre d' Etude du Polymorphisme Humain lymphoblastoid cell lines (24 pedigrees) was evaluated following treatment with daunorubicin for 72 h. Heritability analysis showed a significant genetic component contributing to the cytotoxic phenotypes (h2 = 0.18-0.63 at 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 mumol/L daunorubicin and at the IC50, the dose required to inhibit 50% cell growth). Whole-genome linkage scans at all drug concentrations and IC50 uncovered 11 regions with moderate peak LOD scores (> 1.5), including 4q28.2 to 4q32.3 with a maximum LOD score of 3.18. The quantitative transmission disequilibrium tests were done using 31,312 high-frequency single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in the 1 LOD confidence interval of these 11 regions. Thirty genes were identified as significantly associated with daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity (P < or = 2.0 x 10(-4), false discovery rate < or = 0.1). Pathway and functional gene ontology analysis showed that these genes were overrepresented in the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, axon guidance pathway, and GPI-anchored proteins family. Our findings suggest that a proportion of susceptibility to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity may be controlled by genetic determinants and that analysis using linkage-directed association studies with dense SNP markers can be used to identify the genetic variants contributing to cytotoxicity.
Two adult patients suffered postoperative delirium following administration of lorazepam, a new benzodiazepine sedative. Physostigmine was found effective in reversing all untoward central nervous system effects.
Reports of histologically proven low-dose methotrexate (MTX)-induced vasculitis are uncommon and mostly found for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Herein we present a patient with ankylosing spondylitis who developed large atypical erythematopurpuric cutaneous lesions after the second oral dose of 7.5 mg MTX therapy. The histological findings of a cutaneous lesion were consistent with vasculitis. The skin lesions regressed significantly after the discontinuation of MTX therapy. As the clinical picture of the patient's rheumatological condition became progressively severe, prednisolone therapy was initiated 8 days later and the skin rash resolved completely in a couple of weeks.
In this study, 12 months old female Swiss albino rats were used. They were randomly divided into four groups. The animals of group I were fed with pellet chow. Group II were fed with pellet chow and treated with 250 microg/kg CrCl3 x 6H2O and 100 mg/kg niacin for 45 days. Group III were fed a lipogenic diet consisting of 2% cholesterol, 0.5% cholic acid and 2% sunflower oil added to the pellet chow, and given 3%alcoholic water for 60 days. Group IV were fed with the same lipogenic diet for 60 day sand treated by gavage technique to rats at a dose of 250 micro/kg CrCl3 x 6H2O and 100 mg/kg niacin for 45 days, 15 days after experimental animals were rendered hyperlipidemic. At the 60th day, renal tissue and blood samples were taken from the animals. The sections were examined under light and electron microscopy. The degenerative changes were much more in the hyperlipidemic rats than the control group. The changes in renal tissue were also observed in hyperlipidemic animals given niacin and chromium. In the hyperlipidemic rats, renal glutathione levels decreased and renal lipid peroxidation levels, and serum urea and creatinine levels were increased. But, renal glutathione levels increased and lipid peroxidation levels and serum urea and creatinine levels decreased in hyperlipidemic rats given niacin and chromium. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a protective effect of a combination of niacin and chromium is present on the renal tissue of hyperlipidemic rats or not. In conclusion, we can say that niacin and chromium do not have a protective effect on the morphology of the renal tissue of hyperlipidemic rats, except a protective effect on their biochemical parameters.
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients after noncardiac surgery is a common problem. The noble gas xenon has been demonstrated to exert substantial neuroprotective properties in animal studies. Therefore, this study was designed to assess POCD after xenon anesthesia in comparison to propofol in elderly patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery.
After approval of the local ethical committee was obtained, 101 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III; age, 65-83 yr) undergoing elective abdominal or urologic surgery (duration, > 2 h) were enrolled into this randomized, double-blinded controlled pilot study. Patients received anesthesia with sufentanil and either propofol or xenon and were assessed before treatment and 1, 6, and 30 days after treatment using a neuropsychological test battery based on previous studies investigating POCD.
There were no significant differences in terms of age, American Society of Anesthesiologists status, education, duration of surgery, administered analgetics, and preoperative neurocognitive status between study groups. POCD as classified was present in 22 patients (44%) of the xenon group versus 25 patients (50%) of the propofol group 1 day after treatment, in 6 xenon patients (12%) versus 9 propofol patients (18%) 6 days after treatment, and in 3 xenon patients (6%) versus 6 propofol patients (12%) 30 days after treatment. These differences were not statistically significant.
Postoperative impairment of neurocognitive function was observed in a substantial proportion of elderly patients even 30 days after treatment. Xenon-based anesthesia was not associated with decreased incidence of POCD in comparison to propofol.
Specific inhibitors of 5-HT reuptake are reported to have lower proconvulsive activity than other antidepressants. A patient with post-traumatic epilepsy who had remained fit-free for many years until she was given the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine is reported. Changes in serotonergic function may play a more widespread role in the pathophysiology of seizure disorders than hitherto thought.
METH is a monoaminergic toxic that destroys dopamine terminals in vivo. Oxidative mechanisms associated with DA metabolism are thought to play an important role in its toxic effects. These ideas were supported by the demonstration that CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) transgenic mice were protected against the toxic effects of the drug. In the present study, we sought to determine if nitric oxide (NO) production was also involved in METH-induced neurotoxicity using primary cultures obtained from fetal rat mesencephalon. METH caused dose- and time-dependent cell death in vitro. Blockade of nitric oxide (NO) formation with several nitric oxide (NO) synthase blockers attenuated METH-mediated toxicity. Moreover, inhibition of ADP-ribosylation with nicotinamide and benzamide also provided protection against the toxicity of the drug. These results, together with our previous results in transgenic mice, support a role for free radicals in METH-induced toxic effects.
A 57-year-old man developed morphea while taking bromocriptine. This drug is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid, one of a class of drugs that is associated with fibrotic disorders. Other agents known for such association are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and beta-adrenergic blockers. A common pathogenesis to link these agents to fibrosis remains uncertain.
Neuroapoptosis is induced by the administration of anesthetic agents to the young. As alpha2 adrenoceptor signaling plays a trophic role during development and is neuroprotective in several settings of neuronal injury, the authors investigated whether dexmedetomidine could provide functional protection against isoflurane-induced injury.
Isoflurane-induced injury was provoked in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures in vitro or in vivo in postnatal day 7 rats by a 6-h exposure to 0.75% isoflurane with or without dexmedetomidine. In vivo, the alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonist atipamezole was used to identify if dexmedetomidine neuroprotection involved alpha2 adrenoceptor activation. The gamma-amino-butyric-acid type A antagonist, gabazine, was also added to the organotypic hippocampal slice cultures in the presence of isoflurane. Apoptosis was assessed using cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. Cognitive function was assessed in vivo on postnatal day 40 using fear conditioning.
In vivo dexmedetomidine dose-dependently prevented isoflurane-induced injury in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex; this neuroprotection was attenuated by treatment with atipamezole. Although anesthetic treatment did not affect the acquisition of short-term memory, isoflurane did induce long-term memory impairment. This neurocognitive deficit was prevented by administration of dexmedetomidine, which also inhibited isoflurane-induced caspase-3 expression in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures in vitro; however, gabazine did not modify this neuroapoptosis.
Dexmedetomidine attenuates isoflurane-induced injury in the developing brain, providing neurocognitive protection. Isoflurane-induced injury in vitro appears to be independent of activation of the gamma-amino-butyric-acid type A receptor. If isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis proves to be a clinical problem, administration of dexmedetomidine may be an important adjunct to prevent isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity.
Various N-(5-chloro-6-substituted-benzothiazol-2-yl)-N'-(substituted phenyl)-[1,3,4]thiadiazole-2,5-diamines (5a-t) were designed and synthesized starting from substituted acetophenones. Structures of all the compounds were confirmed on the basis of spectral and elemental analyses. All the newly synthesized compounds were screened for their anticonvulsant activity and were compared with the standard drug phenytoin sodium. Interestingly, all the compounds showed protections against seizures in the range 50-100% indicative of the promising nature of the compounds against seizure spread. Compounds 5b and 5c showed complete protection against MES induced seizures.
We report the case of an hepatitis induced by ibuprofen in a young 32 years old woman, which allowed to discover an until then unknown systemic lupus erythematosus. After an analysis of the data of the literature, we are able to estimate at more than a 50% the specificity of the above mentioned induced effect of this drug for the diagnosis of lupus. Thus, non only a meningitis, but also an hepatitis induced by the ibuprofen need a systematic research of a connective tissue disease.
Thiols such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are increasingly used in clinical trials of platinum chemotherapy as chemoprotectants. NAC can prevent cisdiamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin)-induced ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity; however, the molecular mechanisms of NAC on apoptosis and cisplatin cytotoxicity remain unknown. We investigated cisplatin cytotoxicity and NAC chemoprotection in human tumor cell lines, as assessed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Cisplatin cytotoxicity was associated with nuclear translocation of apoptosis induction factor, expression of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein, cleavage of caspases 3 and 9, and cleavage of PARP. NAC administration reversed the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects if added concurrent with cisplatin or up to 2 h after cisplatin, but chemoprotection was reduced if NAC administration was delayed more than 2 h and was minimal by 8 h after cisplatin. Expression of tumor suppressor p53 and the cell cycle regulatory protein p21 was stimulated within 5 to 10 min by cisplatin in p53-positive LX-1 small cell lung carcinoma cells, and this effect was blocked by NAC. In p53-negative SKOV3 cells, cisplatin toxicity and NAC chemoprotection remained effective, suggesting that chemoprotection may be mediated through both p53-dependent and -independent pathways. Specific kinase inhibitors demonstrated that cisplatin induced apoptosis through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK pathway. These results show that NAC blocks both the death receptor and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways induced by cisplatin. The time course for NAC chemoprotection after cisplatin matches our previous in vivo results and provides an opportunity to manipulate route and timing to maintain cisplatin antitumor efficacy while protecting against chemotherapy side effects.
The authors describe a longitudinal, placebo-controlled study of the response to drug treatment of a 62-year-old schizoaffective patient hospitalized for 40 years. While neither lithium nor a neuroleptic drug alone was effective, both drugs administered simultaneously led to the gradual extinction of a pronounced behavioral cycle and the disappearance of manifest psychosis. The authors suggest a synergistic interaction between the two drugs and stress the need for sustained trials of the combination in patients with similar behavioral cycles.
The serum level of the aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen (P3NP) was measured in 51 psoriatic patients on long-term, once weekly, low-dose methotrexate and in a control group of patients with extensive psoriasis who had never had systemic treatment. Serum P3NP levels were normal in all control patients, but were elevated in the majority of methotrexate-treated patients, even those with normal or non-specific liver histology. Although the highest P3NP values were found in the groups of patients with fibrosis and cirrhosis, isolated P3NP measurements did not discriminate between individuals with and without significant liver pathology. Neither standard nor dynamic liver function tests were able to identify patients with significant liver damage and in most cases results were in the normal range.
