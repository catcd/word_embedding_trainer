Clomipramine is a chlorinated tricyclic antidepressant commonly used in the treatment of depression (1). The drug is widely prescribed in Europe and Canada and has been recently approved for use in the USA. Its safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding, however, has not been fully established. Very few reports on its effect on the fetus and neonate have been published (2,3). We report a case of a mother treated with clomipramine during pregnancy, and the side effects observed in the infant. The correlation between plasma clomipramine concentrations in the baby's blood and clinical effects are described. Subsequently, we present the pregnancy outcome of five prospectively collected cases.
In vitro experimentation using dispersed human lung mast cells demonstrated that azatadine base, a compound with known H1-antihistamine properties, inhibited anti-IgE-induced release of histamine and leukotriene C4 by 45% and 85%, respectively. To assess the clinical relevance of these findings and to compare in vitro mast cell data with results obtained in vivo, nasally instilled azatadine was tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which nasal challenges with antigen were performed on eight allergic individuals. Pretreatment with azatadine significantly suppressed the number of sneezes following antigen challenge and inhibited the associated elevations in histamine, kinins, and enzyme(s) hydrolyzing the artificial substrate N-alpha-tosyl-L-arginine-methyl-ester in nasal secretions, whereas placebo was inactive. Hence, we showed agreement between our in vitro and in vivo experimental models of the allergic reaction. Topical application of azatadine base has the potential to become an effective antiallergic treatment.
Valacyclovir is an effective oral agent for the treatment of herpes virus infection, however, the pharmacokinetics of the drug are altered in renal failure. It is increasingly recognized that dose adjustment of oral valacyclovir in renal failure is necessary to avoid neurotoxicity. We studied this drug in a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and immunocompromised patient. She developed neurotoxicity with an adjustment dosage of valacyclovir for a cutaneous zoster infection. The elimination half-time (15 h) was similar to that reported for end-stage renal disease patients, while the steady-state volume of distribution (85 l) and the area under the curve concentration (127 mg/l.h) were greater. The mean CAPD dialysance was only 5.27 ml/min with less than 1% of an administered dose being recovered in the 24-hour dialysate. 48 h after interrupting treatment, she recovered normal neurological status and 500 mg of valacyclovir every 2 days was effective and well tolerated.
2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AalphaC) is a carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amine (HAA) that is produced in high quantities in tobacco smoke and that also forms in charred meats. The bioactivation of AalphaC occurs by cytochrome P450-mediated (P450 1A2) N-oxidation of the exocyclic amine group, to form 2-hydroxyamino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (HONH-AalphaC). The HONH-AalphaC metabolite can then undergo further activation by phase II enzymes to form the penultimate ester species, which bind to DNA. Some epidemiological studies suggest a role for NAT2 genetic polymorphisms in human susceptibilities to various cancers from tobacco smoke and from consumption of well-done meats, where the exposures to AalphaC can be substantial. In this investigation, we have measured the genotoxicity of AalphaC in nucleotide excision repair-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human P450 1A2 and either the NAT2*4 (rapid, wild-type acetylator) or the NAT2*5B (the most common slow acetylator) allele, to determine the role of NAT2 phenotype in the biological effects of AalphaC. Mutations at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus were induced in a dose-dependent manner by AalphaC and were found to be highest in cells transfected with P450 1A2 and NAT2*4, followed by cells transfected with P450 1A2 and NAT2*5B. The level of formation of the deoxyguanosine (dG) adduct N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (dG-C8-AalphaC) paralleled the mutagenic potency in these cell lines. However, AalphaC did not form DNA adducts or induce mutations in untransfected CHO cells or in cells only expressing P450 1A2. These findings clearly demonstrate that NAT2 genetic polymorphism plays a major role in the genotoxic potency of AalphaC.
Despite being one of the most important antioxidant defenses, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1) has been frequently associated with harmful effects, including neurotoxicity. This toxicity has been attributed to immature forms of Sod1 and extraneous catalytic activities. Among these, the ability of Sod1 to function as a peroxidase may be particularly relevant because it is increased in bicarbonate buffer and produces the reactive carbonate radical. Despite many studies, how this radical forms remains unknown. To address this question, we systematically studied hSod1 peroxidase activity in the presence of nitrite, formate, and bicarbonate-carbon dioxide. Kinetic analyses of hydrogen peroxide consumption and of nitrite, formate, and bicarbonate-carbon dioxide oxidation showed that the Sod1-bound hydroxyl-like oxidant functions in the presence of nitrite and formate. In the presence of bicarbonate-carbon dioxide, this oxidant is replaced by peroxymonocarbonate, which is then reduced to the carbonate radical. Peroxymonocarbonate intermediacy was evidenced by (13)C NMR experiments showing line broadening of its peak in the presence of Zn,ZnSod1. In agreement, peroxymonocarbonate was docked into the hSod1 active site, where it interacted with the conserved Arg(143). Also, a reaction between peroxymonocarbonate and Cu(I)Sod1 was demonstrated by stopped-flow experiments. Kinetic simulations indicated that peroxymonocarbonate is produced during Sod1 turnover and not in bulk solution. In the presence of bicarbonate-carbon dioxide, sustained hSod1-mediated oxidations occurred with low steady-state concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (4-10 microM). Thus, carbonate radical formation through peroxymonocarbonate may be a key event in Sod1-induced toxicity.
Psoriasis appears to be a T-cell-mediated, HLA-associated genetic skin disease that profoundly alters epidermal differentiation in a reversible manner. The topical treatment of mild-to-moderate stable plaque psoriasis is limited by side-effects, cosmetic problems, and often by unsatisfactory efficacy, while systemic therapy is usually not warranted because of safety concerns. Tazarotene is the first member of a novel acetylenic and non-isomerisable class of retinoids to undergo extensive clinical testing. Tazarotene therapy regulates gene transcription via interaction with specific nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), thereby modulating the three key pathogenic factors in psoriasis. Systemic absorption is minimal and, in contrast to some other retinoids, elimination is rapid. The results of Phase II and Phase III controlled clinical studies have shown tazarotene to be an effective treatment for psoriasis. The clinical response is rapid, and in many patients was sustained for several weeks following discontinuation of therapy. Adverse effects are generally limited to mild-to-moderate local effects, as seen with other topical retinoid therapies. Convenient once-daily application of tazarotene gel is effective first-line monotherapy for mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, providing rapid and sustained benefits, while minimal systemic absorption and rapid elimination appear to limit the potential for systemic side-effects.
We screened 50 Korean traditional natural plants to measure the activation effect on choline acetyltransferase and attenuation of scopolamine-induced amnesia. The methanolic extracts from Zizyphus jujuba among the tested 50 plants, showed the highest activatory effect (34.1%) on choline acetyltransferase in vitro. By sequential fractionation of Zizyphus jujuba, the active component was finally identified as cis-9-octadecenoamide (oleamide). After isolation, oleamide showed a 65% activation effect. Administration of oleamide (0.32%) to mice significantly reversed the scopolamine-induced memory and/or cognitive impairment in the passive avoidance test and Y-maze test. Injection of scopolamine to mice impaired performance on the passive avoidance test (31% decrease in step-through latency), and on the Y-maze test (16% decrease in alternation behavior). In contrast, mice treated with oleamide before scopolamine injection were protected from these changes (12-25% decrease in step-through latency; 1-10% decrease in alternation behavior). These results suggest that oleamide should be a useful chemo-preventive agent against Alzheimer's disease.
Testicular dysgenesis syndrome refers to a collection of diseases in men, including testicular cancer, that arise as a result of abnormal testicular development. Phthalates are a class of chemicals used widely in the production of plastic products and other consumer goods. Unfortunately, phthalate exposure has been linked to reproductive dysfunction and has been shown to adversely affect normal germ cell development. In this study, we show that mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) induces matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) expression in testicular embryonal carcinoma NT2/D1 cells but has no significant effect on MMP9 expression. NT2/D1 cells also have higher levels of MYC expression following MEHP treatment. It is widely recognized that activation of MMP2 and MYC is tightly associated with tumor metastasis and tumor progression. Gelatin zymographic analysis indicates that MEHP strongly activates MMP2 in NT2/D1 cells. Addition of the MMP2-specific inhibitor SB-3CT inhibited MEHP-enhanced cell invasion and migration, demonstrating that MMP2 plays a functional role in promoting testicular embryonal carcinoma progression in response to MEHP exposure. Furthermore, we investigated genome-wide gene expression profiles of NT2/D1 cells following MEHP exposure at 0, 3, and 24 h. Microarray analysis and semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that MEHP exposure primarily influenced genes in cell adhesion and transcription in NT2/D1 cells. Gap junction protein-alpha 1, vinculin, and inhibitor of DNA-binding protein-1 were significantly down-regulated by MEHP treatment, while claudin-6 and beta 1-catenin expression levels were up-regulated. This study provides insight into mechanisms that may account for modulating testicular cancer progression following phthalate exposure.
The primary cause of Parkinson's disease is a loss of dopamine in the corpus striatum. It has been postulated that this effect leads to disinhibition of the striopallidal pathway and secondarily, to a functional shift towards glutamatergic stimulation. The aim of the present study was to find out whether inhibition of glutamatergic transmission at a level of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the striatum may alleviate parkinsonian-like symptoms in rats. The non-competitive antagonist of receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5), MPEP (1.0-10 mg/kg ip), or the agonist of group II mGluRs, LY354,740 (5-10 mg/kg ip), reduced haloperidol-induced muscle rigidity and catalepsy. Intrastriatal injections of the mGluR1 antagonist, (RS) AIDA (7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), but not of the agonist of group II mGluRs, 2R,4R-APDC (7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), inhibited the muscle rigidity induced by haloperidol. In order to search for an influence of mGluRs on the striopallidal pathway, the effect of MPEP or of the agonist of group II mGluRs, DCG-IV, on the proenkephalin (PENK) mRNA expression in the dorso-lateral striatum was examined by an in situ hybridization. Repeated MPEP (6 x 10 mg/kg ip) administration did not influence PENK expression in naïve rats, but diminished that increased by haloperidol. In contrast, repeated DCG-IV (3 x 1 nmol/4 microl icv) injections enhanced both the control and the haloperidol-increased levels of PENK expression. The obtained results suggest that blockade of group I mGluRs, or stimulation of group II mGluRs may be important to ameliorate parkinsonian symptoms. Striatal mGluRs may contribute to at least some of these effects.
The distribution of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HS-PG) was examined electron microscopically by the high iron diamine (HID) method in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis, accelerated Masugi nephritis (NTN), and serum sickness nephritis induced by bovine serum albumin (BSA nephritis) in the rat. In PAN nephrosis rats, no change was observed in the distribution of HS-PG in the lamina rara externa (LRE) of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) throughout the experiment. In NTN rats, however, the loss of HS-PG was observed, and it was associated with subepithelial electron dense deposits formed possibly by serum sickness mechanism, but not with inflammatory cell infiltration. In BAS nephritis, immune deposits were seen in mesangial, subendothelial, intramembranous and subepithelial areas. The deposits in the former three areas seemed to have little reciprocity with the loss of HS-PG and proteinuria. Urinary protein increased in accordance with the development of subepithelial deposits and the loss of HS-PG in the area of the deposits in the LRE. These results indicate that HS-PG could be preserved even in marked proteinuric states in morphologically intact basement membrane, but altered and lost distribution of HS-PG associated with subepithelial immune deposits could in turn result in the development of proteinuria.
H2-antagonists such as cimetidine and ranitidine are metabolized by cytochrome P-450. In this way they may interfere with theophylline metabolism. Cimetidine is known to have this effect and frequently to induce a theophylline toxic effect, while data concerning ranitidine are more uncertain. In this paper, we report the case of a 67-year-old woman with non-insulin dependent diabetes. She was taking aminophylline for respiratory failure and after ranitidine infusion exhibited generalized convulsions. Theophylline values which were monitored within the therapeutic range, increased toxic levels after ranitidine therapy and epileptic episodes. The increase in theophylline levels was associated with a further reduction in the clearance rate of the bronchodilator. We think that ranitidine may combine with other clinical factors known to reduce theophylline metabolism mainly in the elderly and severely ill patients. Theophylline-induced seizures may occur when theophylline serum levels are slightly above the therapeutic range, as in our case report.
To examine if a single or multiple oral administration of metformin, a member of the biguanide class of anti-diabetic agents, has any genotoxic and cytotoxic potential in normal and diabetic rats, a mammalian model, cytogenetic assays through several endpoints such as induction of micronuclei, chromosome aberrations, mitotic activity of bone marrow cells, sperm-head anomaly and assays of some oxidative stress markers have been conducted by the use of standard techniques. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection. Metformin was administrated to both diabetic and non-diabetic rats in single doses of 100, 500 or 2500 mg/kg along with vehicle control groups for diabetic and non-diabetic rats. The animals were killed by cervical dislocation at 24h after treatment, and then bone marrow cells were sampled. Also, a multiple dose study has done in which diabetic and non-diabetic animals were treated with 100 or 500 mg/kg of metformin daily for 4 or 8 weeks after which the animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and then bone marrow and sperm cells were collected. Concurrent control groups were also included in each experiment. The obtained results revealed that metformin was neither genotoxic nor cytotoxic for the rats in all groups at all tested doses. Moreover, metformin significantly reduced the diabetes-induced genomic instability and cell proliferation changes in somatic and germinal cells in a dose-dependent manner (2500, 500, >100mg/kg). In addition, diabetes induced marked biochemical alterations characteristic of oxidative stress including, enhanced lipid peroxidation and reduction in the reduced glutathione level. Treatment with metformin ameliorated these biochemical markers. In conclusion, metformin is a non-genotoxic or cytotoxic compound and may protect from genomic instability induced by hyperglycemia. Apart from its well-known anti-diabetic effect, the antigenotoxic effect of metformin could be possibly ascribed to its radical scavenger effect that modulated the genomic instability responses and cell proliferation changes induced by hyperglycemia.
2-Amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) is a very potent mutagen which induces tumors in the liver, lung and hematopoietic system of CDF1 mice and the liver, Zymbal gland and skin in F344 rats. The recent development of transgenic knockout mice allows their introduction for sensitive screening of environmental carcinogens due to the rapid development of tumors. P53 gene deficient mice (p53-/-) were found to spontaneously develop malignant lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma, whereas heterozygotes (p53+/-) mice display a high incidence of tumors of the urinary bladder when treated with N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine. In the present study, to determine whether p53 gene knockout mice can be utilized in a short-term assay model for the screening of heterocyclic amines (HCAs), the effects of MeIQx, as a representative compound, at low doses were examined. Male and female p53+/- mice and wild type littermates (p53+/+) were continuously given diets containing 0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 ppm MeIQx for 1 year. No significant difference in tumor induction was observed other than an increase in liver adenomas in males receiving 10 ppm MeIQx treatment. The results indicate that p53+/- mice have no practical advantages for use in short-term carcinogenicity tests of HCAs.
The frequency and nature of side-effects are analysed in 945 patients subjected to 1205 intravenous infusions of various antiarrhythmic agents. The most common side-effects of novocainamide, isoptin, obsidan, lidocain and trimecain are arterial hypotension and shock, while conductivity disorders, asystole (novocainamide, isoptin), bradycardia, acute heart failure (obsidan) are less frequent. Rapid strophanthin saturation in patients with supraventricular paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias can result in ventricular extrasystole, and the use of phenylephrine hydrochloride can produce an excessive hypertensive response. The occurrence of side-effects can be reduced considerably if antiarrhythmic agents are employed on a correct methodological basis, with adequate infusion rate observed, the first dose correctly chosen, potassium preparations added to the treatment, etc.
Administration of a single high dose or multiple low doses of isoproterenol (ISO) to rats induces myocardial necrosis and cardiac hypertrophy. To assess the extent of necrosis we measured myocardial activities of creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the first days after ISO-treatment. After a single high dose and multiple low doses of ISO, necrosis was 10% and 25%, respectively. To quantify the degree of hypertrophy we measured heart weight and myocyte volume, and calculated cardiac CK, AST and DNA content up to 50 days after ISO-treatment. After a single high dose and multiple low doses of ISO, myocyte volume increased by 27% and 92%, respectively, while heart weight increased by 15% and 56%, respectively. As in this model hypertrophy is associated with focal necrosis, heart weight gain underestimates the actual increase of myocyte volume.
Adenosine has been shown to have a wide spectrum of unique pain-relieving effects in various clinical situations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intraoperative adenosine infusion on acute opioid tolerance and opioid induced hyperalgesia induced by remifentanil in adult patients undergoing tonsillectomy.
For this study, ninety patients were randomly allocated into groups that receive either adenosine (adenosine group) or saline (remifentnail group) intravenously under remifentanil based anesthesia and saline (sevoflurane group) under sevoflurane anesthesia. The patients in adenosine group received adenosine at dose of 80 µg/kg/min, and those in remifentnail group and sevoflurane group received an equal volume of saline 10 minutes after the induction of anesthesia until the end of surgery. Intraoperative evaluation included time weighted mean remifentanil dose, and postoperative evaluations included degree of pain severity at 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours, time to first postoperative requirement, and analgesic dose required during 24 hours after operation.
Time weighted mean remifentanil dose during intraoperative period in adenosine group was significantly lower than that of remifentnail group (P = 0.00). The first postoperative analgesic were required earlier in remifentanil group than sevoflurane group or adenosine group (P = 0.00). Pethidine requirement during 24 hours in sevoflurane group and adenosine group was significantly lower than that of remifentnail group (P = 0.00). The visual analog scale scores for pain in sevoflurane group and adenosine group were significantly lower than those of remifentnail group for 12 hours after operation (P = 0.00). Incidence of hypotension (P = 0.024) and number of ephedrine administered (P = 0.011) in adenosine group were significantly higher than those of sevoflurane group.
The above results suggest that intraoperative adenosine infusion prevent acute opioid tolerance and opioid induced hyperalgesia induced by remifentanil.
Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) has been reported on positron-emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography of stroke patients. Rarely it has been described with brain diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) of status epilepticus (SE).
Case report.
A 53-year-old woman was found unresponsive after cocaine use. A diagnostic electroencephalogram was consistent with ictal SE. A brain DWI showed reduced diffusion in the left temporo-parietal and occipital cortexes, the left thalamus and the right cerebellum. The DWI changes did not correspond to a vascular territory and were attributed to seizure activity and secondary CCD. A 2-week follow-up DWI showed interval near-complete resolution of the diffusion changes. CCD in SE may represent injury caused by excessive neuronal transmission from prolonged excitatory synaptic activity via the cortico-pontine-cerebellar pathway. Alternatively, it may be a result of interruption of the cortico-pontine-cerebellar pathway with loss of cortical inhibitory input.
This case documents CCD during SE, providing further evidence of contralateral cerebellar involvement with a supratentorial epileptiform focus.
The Black Box Warning section of the U.S. drug label for leflunomide was recently updated to include stronger warnings about potential hepatotoxicity from this novel anti-arthritis drug. Because metabolic activation is a key mechanism for drug-induced hepatotoxicity, we examined whether leflunomide and its major metabolite, A77 1726, are cytotoxic to primary rat hepatocytes and whether their toxicity is modulated by hepatic cytochrome P450s (CYPs). As measured by lactate dehydrogenase leakage, time-dependent cytotoxicity was observed at 250-500 μM for leflunomide and 330-500 μM for A77 1726 within 20 h. Unexpectedly, three nonisoenzyme-specific CYP inhibitors, including SKF-525A, metyrapone, and 1-aminobenzotriazole, did not reduce but remarkably enhanced the cytotoxicity of leflunomide or A77 1726. SKF-525A pretreatment notably rendered hepatocytes susceptible to as low as 15 μM leflunomide or A77 1726. Three isoenzyme-specific CYP inhibitors including alpha-naphthoflavone, ticlopidine, and ketoconazole that mainly target CYP1A, CYP2B/2C, and CYP3A, respectively, also enhanced the cytotoxicity. A strong synergistic effect, similar to SKF-525A alone, was noted using a combination of all three of the isoenzyme-specific inhibitors. Hepatocytes pretreated with the CYP inducer dexamethasone for 24 h exhibited decreased cytotoxicity to leflunomide and A77 1726. At the concentrations tested, the CYP inhibitors and inducer showed no cytotoxicity. These data demonstrate that the parent forms of leflunomide and A77 1726 are more toxic to hepatocytes than their poorly characterized metabolites, indicating that the metabolic process of leflunomide is a detoxification step rather than an initiating event leading to toxicity.
Using in situ hybridization, it was found that subchronic treatment with levodopa/benserazide increased preproenkephalin-A and preproenkephalin-B mRNAs in the dopamine-depleted striatum. In order to examine whether dysfunction of the endogenous opioid system may underlie the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesias, the effect of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, on dyskinesias was investigated in two models of parkinsonism in the common marmoset. MPTP-treated monkeys were administered a daily oral dose of levodopa/benserazide which relieved the parkinsonian symptoms but induced severe and reproducible dyskinetic movements. Naloxone (0.1, 0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously (s.c.) during peak-dose dyskinesia, which reduced the dyskinesias significantly using the highest dose, normalized the motor activity, but did not modify the antiparkinson effect. Unilaterally 6-OHDA -lesioned marmosets received apomorphine s.c., which caused a contralateral turning behavior that could be reduced up to 35 percent by concomitant administration of naloxone. Taken together the present results suggest a possible role for the endogenous opioid system in the pathogenesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in primates.
Keratins 8 and 18 (K8/18) are intermediate filament phosphoglycoproteins that are expressed preferentially in simple-type epithelia. We recently described transgenic mice that express point-mutant human K18 (Ku, N.-O., S. Michie, R.G. Oshima, and M.B. Omary. 1995. J. Cell Biol. 131:1303-1314) and develop chronic hepatitis and hepatocyte fragility in association with hepatocyte keratin filament disruption. Here we show that mutant K18 expressing transgenic mice are highly susceptible to hepatotoxicity after acute administration of acetaminophen (400 mg/Kg) or chronic ingestion of griseofulvin (1.25% wt/wt of diet). The predisposition to hepatotoxicity results directly from the keratin mutation since nontransgenic or transgenic mice that express normal human K18 are more resistant. Hepatotoxicity was manifested by a significant difference in lethality, liver histopathology, and biochemical serum testing. Keratin glycosylation decreased in all griseofulvin-fed mice, whereas keratin phosphorylation increased dramatically preferentially in mice expressing normal K18. The phosphorylation increase in normal K18 after griseofulvin feeding appears to involve sites that are different to those that increase after partial hepatectomy. Our results indicate that hepatocyte intermediate filament disruption renders mice highly susceptible to hepatotoxicity, and raises the possibility that K18 mutations may predispose to drug hepatotoxicity. The dramatic phosphorylation increase in nonmutant keratins could provide survival advantage to hepatocytes.
Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common of all human congenital defects. Over the last two decades, accumulating evidence has made it clear that periconceptional intake of folic acid can significantly reduce the risk of NTD affected pregnancies. This beneficial effect may be related to the ability of folates to donate methyl groups for critical physiological reactions. Choline is an essential nutrient and it is also a methyl donor critical for the maintenance of cell membrane integrity and methyl metabolism. Perturbations in choline metabolism in vitro have been shown to induce NTDs in mouse embryos.
This study investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human choline kinase A (CHKA) gene and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylytransferase (PCYT1A) gene were risk factors for spina bifida. Fluorescence-based allelic discrimination analysis was performed for the two CHKA intronic SNPs hCV1562388 (rs7928739) and hCV1562393, and PCYT1A SNP rs939883 and rs3772109. The study population consisted of 103 infants with spina bifida and 338 non-malformed control infants who were born in selected California counties in the period 1989-1991.
The CHKA SNP hCV1562388 genotypes with at least one C allele were associated with a reduced risk of spina bifida (odds ratio = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.38-0.94). The PCYT1A SNP rs939883 genotype AA was associated with a twofold increased risk of spina bifida (odds ratio = 1.89, 95% CI = 0.97-3.67). These gene-only effects were not substantially modified by analytic consideration to maternal periconceptional choline intake.
Our analyses showed genotype effects of CHKA and PCYT1A genes on spina bifida risk, but did not show evidence of gene-nutrient interactions. The underlying mechanisms are yet to be resolved.
To investigate the role of copper (Cu)-related cellular responses on thyroid carcinogenesis, the expression of ceruloplasmin (Cp) and metallothionein (MT)-1/2 were examined in relation to the activities of cell proliferation/apoptosis in the thyroid of rats at an early stage of tumor promotion under different dietary Cu levels. Male F344 rats were initiated with N-bis(2-hydroxypropyl)nitrosamine by single subcutaneous injection at 2800 mg/kg body weight, and 1 week later promoted with 6-propyl-2-thiouracil at 12 ppm in the drinking water for 4 weeks. Animals were fed a diet containing Cu at 0.6, 6 or 60 ppm from the time point of initiator-treatment to create marginally deficient, normal, or non-toxic supplementary levels of Cu. At both 0.6 and 60 pm, the multiplicity of preneoplastic focal follicular cell hyperplasias (FFCHs) was decreased as compared with 6 ppm Cu, while adenomas also decreased at 0. 6 ppm Cu. Both 0.6 and 60 ppm Cu levels revealed decreased Ki-67-immunoreactive proliferating cells in both FFCHs and surrounding follicles accompanied by mRNA downregulation of Cdc2a and Ccnb1, while TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were unaltered with change of dietary Cu. Both Cp and MT-1/2 were immunolocalized in FFCHs and adenomas, with higher distribution in the latter. At both 0.6 and 60 ppm, the immunoreactivities and/or thyroidal mRNA levels of Cp and MT-1/2 were also decreased. Transcript levels of several antioxidant enzymes were up- or downregulated in the same direction at both Cu levels. Serum levels of thyroid-related hormones were unaltered at both Cu levels, except for non-significant reduction of thyroid-stimulating hormone at 0.6 ppm. These results suggest an involvement of Cp and MT-1/2 on the thyroid tumor promotion that can be suppressed by dietary Cu level through inhibition of cell proliferation associated with altered redox balance.
Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase that is produced by a genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has been approved for prophylaxis and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome in 2001. In several studies, rasburicase, given at a dose of 0.15-0.2 mg/kg for up to 7 d, proved to be highly effective in lowering urate levels.
We report the case of a patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) who experienced tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with acute renal failure after fludarabine/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and after bendamustine treatment. During the first episode of TLS, after fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (creatinine 3.3 mg/dL, urate 24.6 mg/dL), the patient received rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg for 3 d. Urate levels decreased below the lower limit of normal and renal function recovered. After bendamustine therapy, given for disease progression 8 months later, TLS with acute oliguric renal failure re-occurred (creatinine 3.1 mg/dL, urate 20.8 mg/dL). The patient was treated with hyperhydration and two doses of rasburicase (0.056 mg/kg), resulting in a prompt decrease of the urate level and recovery of renal function. Both episodes of TLS were successfully treated with rasburicase in a lower dose than recommended by the manufacturer. During a second bendamustine course, TLS was successfully treated by low doses of rasburicase (0.056 mg/kg for 2 d).
This is the first report of TLS in CLL after bendamustine chemotherapy reported in the literature. Treatment and prevention of TLS by low doses of rasburicase is possible and cost-effective.
Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide with diet playing a prominent role in disease initiation and progression. Diet and nutrition play an important role during this multistep colon carcinogenic process. We have investigated the modulatory efficacy of hesperetin on aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon carcinogenesis. Male albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups. Group 1 served as control, received modified pellet diet and group 2 rats received 20mg/kg body weight of hesperetin p.o. every day. Groups 3-6 rats were given subcutaneous injections of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (20mg/kg body weight) once a week for 15 weeks to induce ACF in the colon. In addition, rats in group 4 received hesperetin as in group 2 orally for the first 15 weeks (initiation), group 5 rats received hesperetin as in group 2 after the last injection of DMH and continued till the end of the experimental period (post-initiation). Group 6 received hesperetin as in group 2 throughout the entire period of 32 weeks. DMH exposure showed high incidence (90%) of ACF (280+/-24.5 aberrant crypt/colon) and dysplastic ACF, elevated activities of phase I enzymes and reduced the activities of phase II enzymes in the liver and colonic mucosa of colon cancer bearing rats. Hesperetin supplementation significantly reversed these effects, the effect being more pronounced in group 6 rats (hesperetin supplemented throughout the study period). These findings suggest that hesperetin can significantly reduce the formation of preneoplastic lesions and effectively modulate the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in rats.
Fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) are raw materials used in the manufacture of polymeric and surfactant products. Based on previous findings from single oral dosing in rats with radiolabeled 8-2 FTOH, glutathione (GSH) depletion and/or the presence of perfluorinated/polyfluorinated acids and aldehyde metabolites was hypothesized to account for the hepatocellular lesions observed in male rats from a 90-day subchronic oral dosing study. Further, the reported nephropathy in female rats from the subchronic experiment was hypothesized to have been initiated by a thiol metabolite produced by degradation of GSH conjugates. In the current investigation, the kinetics of 8-2 FTOH and its metabolites along with liver GSH status were evaluated in the rat following daily oral dosing with 8-2 FTOH for 45 days at 5 and 125 mg/kg/day. Liver GSH stores 1-2h after dosing were unaffected, suggesting that GSH depletion is not likely a relevant mode of action in the liver. The tissue metabolite data indicate that the liver toxicity mode of action is likely associated with elevated levels of perfluoroalkyl acids found in males, since other polyfluorinated metabolites and 8-2 FTOH were present in livers from female rats at comparable or higher levels. Detection of the N-acetyl cysteine conjugate of the unsaturated parent telomer alcohol in urine from female rats and not male rats provides some evidence to support the mechanistic basis for the observed kidney effects. Further, the increasing levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in plasma from female rats over the 45-day dosing phase, while unexpected, may reflect an increased net absorption of 8-2 FTOH, slow elimination of intermediates in the metabolic pathway between 8-2 FTOH and PFOA, or altered kidney clearance. The results of this study have enhanced our understanding of 8-2 FTOH kinetics and metabolism and potential modes of action in the rat, which will guide the design of future studies for FTOHs and our need to define the mechanistic basis for the observed effects.
Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components in the alveolar space, which hampers normal respiration process. Pathophysiological enzymes, glycoprotein moieties and matrix degrading lysosomal hydrolases are key markers and play a crucial role in the progression of fibrosis. Bleomycin is an anti-neoplastic drug, used for the treatment of various types of cancers and induces pulmonary fibrosis due its deleterious side effect. Tea catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is known for its wide array of beneficial effects. The present study was intended to evaluate the beneficial efficacy of EGCG against bleomycin-induced glycoconjugates, lysosomal hydrolases and ultrastructural changes in the lungs of Wistar rats. Intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (6.5 U/kg body weight) to rats increased the activities of pathophysiological enzymes such as aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase, which were attenuated upon EGCG treatment. The increased level of hydroxyproline and histopathological parameters in bleomycin-induced rats were decreased upon EGCG treatment. Bleomycin-induced increase in the level of glycoconjugates was restored closer to normal levels on EGCG treatment. Furthermore, the increased activities of matrix degrading lysosomal enzymes in bleomycin-induced rats were reduced upon EGCG supplementation. Treatment with EGCG also attenuated bleomycin-induced ultrastructural changes as observed from transmission electron microscopy studies. The results of the present study put-forward EGCG as a potential anti-fibrotic agent due to its attenuating effect on potential fibrotic markers.
