Veno-occlusive disease of the liver is a common cause of morbidity and mortality after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. Non thrombotic hepatic venous obstruction is characteristic, but pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown.
In june 1993, a 58-year-old man was treated by cyclophosphamide and steroid for a POEMS syndrome. In november 1996, he developed hepatalgia, edema, ascitis and jaundice. The diagnosis of hepatic veno-occlusive disease was obtained by hepatic biopsy. Refractory ascitis was treated by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Gradual improvement in clinical status was observed after this therapy.
This observation offers three original types of information: there has been no prior report of an association between veno-occlusive disease and POEMS syndrome, the role of low dose cyclophosphamide in hepatic veno-occlusive disease was certain, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is an interesting therapy with one years remission.
In a 40-year old patient with schizophrenia treated with sustained-action perfenazine for schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension developed when clozapine was added to the regimen. The blood sugar values and the blood pressure normalized when clozapine was discontinued two weeks later. When he was 44 years old, clozapine was resumed as the psychotic symptoms did not subside. Diabetes mellitus reappeared and did not disappear after discontinuation of the clozapine. Insulin therapy was necessary. An association between the emergence of diabetes mellitus and the use of clozapine is suggested. Previously 15 cases of diabetes mellitus emerging during treatment with clozapine were described in the international literature. Monitoring of blood glucose is advised in patients with a positive family history of diabetes mellitus or with a personal history of impaired glucose tolerance.
We have previously shown that in response to treatment with HgCl(2), the adult mouse liver exhibits both transcriptional and translational regulation of the acute phase response genes. In this study we asked whether the heavy metal treatment affects the regulation of the C/EBP transcription factors which play a key role in regulation of the acute phase response gene. Our studies have shown that the AGP gene is transcriptionally activated while transcription of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding trans-activating protein (C/EBP)alpha gene is slightly down-regulated and that of the C/EBPbeta gene does not respond. Both the C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta mRNAs produce multiple isoforms possibly by alternative translation initiation (ATI) of multiple internal AUG initiation sites. The C/EBPbeta mRNA appears to be stabilized. Although similar regulatory processes occur in response HgCl(2) vs. LPS, our data suggest that the translational processes (ATI) are differentially affected. In addition, a major difference lies in the fact that the C/EBPbeta gene is not transcriptionally activated by HgCl(2). Our data show decreased binding activity and pool levels of the C/EBPalpha isoform (p42(C/EBPalpha)) and increased binding activity and pool levels of C/EBPbeta isoform (p35(C/EBPbeta)) in response to HgCl(2). We propose that this isoform may be involved in the regulation of AGP gene expression in response to heavy metals and that there is a significant difference between the HgCl(2)-mediated and LPS-mediated inflammatory response.
Clozapine and risperidone have been implicated in the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. We present three cases in which olanzapine caused a significant exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia (two cases) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (one case).
The hepatocyte low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) plays a pivotal role in lipoprotein metabolism by lowering plasma LDL-cholesterol, a risk factor for atherosclerosis. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of grape polyphenols on LDLR gene expression in human hepatocyte models.
Among the 14 phenolic compounds in red wine, we found that a stilbene trans-resveratrol most strongly up-regulated LDLR gene expression in HepG2 cells. Trans-resveratrol increased the LDLR protein and uptake of fluorescent-labeled LDL. Moreover, it enhanced LDLR gene promoter activity through the proteolytic activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) as well as SREBP-1. However, sterols completely abolished trans-resveratrol-induced SREBP activation and LDLR gene expression. Finally, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) knockdown analyses by siRNA revealed that AMPK activation was unnecessary for the effects of trans-resveratrol.
Trans-resveratrol up-regulated hepatic LDLR expression via proteolytic activation of SREBPs. We concluded that trans-resveratrol exhibits the anti-atherogenic effect, at least in part, by increased hepatic LDLR expression and subsequent LDL uptake.
Environmental cues associated with the previously abused drug elicit craving and relapse to drug use in humans. Several reinstatement paradigms are used in animals to examine the relapse-preventing efficacy of possible medical treatments. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of D3 dopamine receptor ligands in a relapse model where animals with stable cocaine self-administration behavior were exposed to all the environmental and reinforcement-contingent discrete cues associated for the previous cocaine-intake in a single extinction session after 3-week long abstinence period. The following compounds were studied: SB-277011-A as a selective D3 antagonist, BP-897 as a D3 partial agonist/D2 antagonist and haloperidol as a preferential D2 receptor antagonist. In addition, in the same paradigm we investigated the effect of the above ligands on relapse to natural reward-seeking behavior using sucrose as natural reward. SB-277011-A (5 and 20 mg/kg), BP-897 (1 mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the secondary cues-induced cocaine-seeking behavior. None of the above drugs significantly influenced the cue-controlled sucrose-seeking behavior. These results confirm the importance of the D3 as well as the D2 dopamine receptor in modulating the cue-induced cocaine relapse and the possible usefulness of the D3 dopamine receptor ligands as potential medication in cocaine addicts.
Ever since their discovery about 60 years ago as therapeutic agent for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar, pentavalent antimonials (Sb(v)) have remained the first line treatment of choice all over the world including India. But recently, the number of kala-azar patients unresponsive to sodium stibogluconate (SSG) therapy, is steadily increasing in India. In this study, three clinical isolates, of which two were from SSG unresponsive and one from SSG responsive patients were evaluated for their infectivity and for their chemotherapeutic responses in vitro (macrophage-amastigote system) and in vivo (in hamsters). Persistence of SSG resistance was also checked by repeated passages in vitro as well as in vivo. The drug resistant strains (2039 and 2041) did not respond to SSG therapy both in vitro as well as in vivo but strains 2001 and Dd8 showed full sensitivity to SSG treatment. All the four strains responded well to amphotericin B and miltefosine treatment both in macrophages and in hamsters. The specific chemotherapeutic responses of all the strains to SSG were consistently persistent after repeated passages in cultures and in vivo, which indicates that these isolates are truly refractory to SSG treatment in field conditions. Two isolates were also transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) for the development of in vitro assay for studying antileishmanial activities of new and reference drugs in macrophages by flow cytometry.
Family-based studies to map susceptibility genes through linkage disequilibrium have been successful in early-onset diseases where parental-proband trios are readily collected, but are believed to be unworkable for late-onset diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD). PROCARDIS is a European multicentre study that was designed to identify susceptibility genes for CAD. We have tested the transmission of a putatively functional allele, lymphotoxin-alpha N26 (804A), in more than 400 PROCARDIS trio families. The present study demonstrates association of this allele with CAD in white Europeans, a different ethnic group with a heavier CAD burden than the Japanese in which the association was initially identified, which suggests a broad relevance to CAD susceptibility. The practicalities of implementing a trio-family design for late-onset diseases are discussed.
Loss of expression of TSSC3, an apoptosis-related imprinted gene, has been reported in several cases of malignant tumors. However, the roles and mechanisms of TSSC3 in human osteosarcoma remain to be defined. In this study, we found TSSC3 to be downregulated during osteosarcoma transformation and progression in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues. The SaOS2 cell line was used to further evaluate the precise role of TSSC3 in osteosarcoma development. Overexpression of TSSC3 markedly reduced cell vitality and growth, colony formation, Ki67 expression as well as cell cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. Consistently, TSSC3 overexpression was associated with increased apoptosis assayed by annexin V/propidium iodide and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling staining. Subcutaneous injection of TSSC3 overexpressing SaOS2 cells into athymic nude mice showed that TSSC3 also inhibited tumorigenesis through growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in vivo. Further mechanistic studies revealed that the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was required for TSSC3-mediated cell apoptosis. These findings support a suppressor role for TSSC3 in osteosarcoma development by regulating apoptosis. In addition, constitutive TSSC3 expression greatly enhanced the sensitivity of human osteosarcoma cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and epirubicin. Conversely, TSSC3 knockdown increased SaOS2 cell growth and decreased apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and reduced sensitivity of the cells to chemotherapy. This is the first study to demonstrate that TSSC3 has a potent tumor suppressor role in osteosarcoma, probably by inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
Plethoryl is a combination of triatricol, cyclovalone and vitamin A normally prescribed in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Four cases of side-effects most probably caused by this product are reported. They include: 1) a case of common acute hepatitis, 23 cases of which have already been published, with aggravation and reduced time-lapse after reintroduction; 2) a case of clinically silent but biochemically classical hepatitis; 3) a case of cirrhosis due to vitamin A toxicity; 4) a case of inflammatory arthralgias recurring after the same time-lag when the drug was reintroduced despite double doses and without clinical evidence of hepatitis. The last three side-effects have never been previously reported. The adverse reactions to Plethoryl almost always occur in the unofficial indications of the product, notably in the "treatment" of obesity.
To confirm the production of IL-1 beta and to optimize detection and semiquantitation of IL-1 beta mRNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques in skeletal muscle tissue, immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting and several procedures of RNA extraction and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR amplification were used on muscle samples from 12 patients with conditions associated with local production of IL-1 beta (AZT myopathy: 6 patients; sarcoid myopathy: 6 patients) and from 9 patients with normal muscle used as controls. Abundant IL-1 beta immunoreactivities, corresponding to both pro IL-1 beta and mature IL-1 beta as assessed by immunoblotting, were observed in all diseased muscles, either in inflammatory cells (sarcoid myopathy) or in atrophic muscle fibers (AZT myopathy). Acid guanidinium isothiocyanate phenol-chloroform extraction of RNA appeared less efficient for IL-1 beta mRNA detection by RT-PCR than proteinase K digestion followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. Even using the latter procedure, RT-single PCR for IL-1 beta mRNA was puzzlingly negative in all cases but one; in contrast, RT-nested PCR specified by DNA enzyme immunoassay yielded detection of IL-1 beta mRNA in all diseased muscles and in occasional controls, including the expected PCR product of 391 bp, but also another product of 935 bp, corresponding to IL-1 beta mRNA with unsplicing of the fourth intron. Semi-quantitative PCR showed that production of IL-1 beta mRNA was higher in sarcoid myopathy than in AZT myopathy, and in AZT myopathy than in controls. In conclusion, IL-1 beta expression can be reliably studied using immunocytochemistry, but assessment of IL-1 beta mRNA production in muscle tissue requires optimized extraction and RT-PCR procedures.
Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced nephrotoxicity is age-dependent in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats: middle-aged (9-12 months old) rats exhibit nephrotoxicity at lower dosages of APAP than do young adults (2-3 months old). The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the intrinsic susceptibility of renal tissue to APAP toxicity is increased in middle-aged rats. APAP toxicity was evaluated in renal slices from naive 3- and 12-month-old male SD rats incubated with 0-50 mM APAP for 2-8 h. Renal slice glutathione (GSH) and APAP concentrations were determined; renal function was assessed by organic anion (para-aminohippurate, PAH) and cation (tetraethylammonium, TEA) accumulation; and cell viability was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage. At each concentration of APAP tested, accumulation of APAP by renal slices was similar in 3- and 12-month-olds. APAP toxicity in renal slices from both 3- and 12-month-old rats was characterized by concentration-dependent increases in LDH leakage. In contrast to APAP nephrotoxicity in vivo, APAP toxicity in renal slices was accompanied by decreased accumulation of PAH and TEA. Additionally, APAP produced marked reductions in renal slice GSH content in a concentration-dependent manner: however, in contrast to APAP nephrotoxicity in vivo, APAP-induced GSH depletion in vitro did not precede cytotoxicity. No consistent age-dependent differences in the time- and concentration-response curves for APAP nephrotoxicity were observed. These data suggest that APAP cytotoxicity in vitro is not increased in 12-month-old rats. However, since the pattern (and mechanisms) of APAP cytotoxicity in vitro appears to be different from that observed in vivo, extrapolation of in vitro cytotoxicity to in vivo nephrotoxicity is limited. Therefore, age differences in intrinsic susceptibility of the intact kidney cannot be excluded as a mechanism contributing to enhanced APAP nephrotoxicity in middle-aged rats.
The present study addressed the question of whether the emergence and severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesia was related to the therapeutic benefits derived from levodopa. Eight PD patients with clinically observed levodopa-induced dyskinesia were studied prior to and for two hours following a single dose of Sinemet (carbidopa/levodopa). Quantitative instrumental procedures were used to assess upper extremity dyskinesia, rigidity and bradykinesia. Results indicated that all patients exhibited significant reduction in their parkinsonism within 45 minutes following treatment. Reduction in bradykinesia, but not rigidity appeared to coincide with the emergence of dyskinesia. There was a significant relationship between severity of dyskinesia and the degree of improvement in movement velocity but not rigidity. Further analyses revealed that this relationship depended largely on the age of the patient. These findings are discussed as they pertain to a unified model of basal ganglia movement disorders which places dyskinesia and bradykinesia at opposite extremes along a continuum.
Forty-six nonhysterectomized women treated with tamoxifen during 6-36 months as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer underwent a hysteroscopy to assess the endometrial effects of this drug. Whereas the endometrium was normal among 23 patients, 13 presented with endometrial polyps, 8 with hyperplasia and 2 with adenocarcinoma. The rate of endometrial lesions was directly related to the cumulative dose of tamoxifen but it was not statistically different among patients receiving progestational therapy compared to patients who did not receive this therapy.
In the present study, effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated. Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose-dependent catalepsy. The response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine. Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, naloxone, mecamylamine, and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine. Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine, hexamethonium, and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine. Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of hexamethonium, decreased the effect of a single dose of morphine. It was concluded that morphine catalepsy can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors, and the potentiation of morphine induced by nicotine may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms.
Neurological toxicity occurred in 8/219 patients treated with fludarabine (FAMP), 30 mg/m2 per day and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), 0.5 g/m2 per hour for 2-6 hours for 5 days, for new or relapsed acute leukemia or myelodysplasia. Two patients developed severe, progressive cerebral dysfunction that was ultimately fatal. This toxicity was similar to that seen with high-dose fludarabine therapy and was limited to patients with serum creatine > or = 2.0 mg/dl and age over 60 years, occurring in 2/9 such patients compared to 0/210 among the other patients (p < 0.005). Since FAMP is partially excreted by the kidney, toxicity in these two patients was likely due to receiving an effectively high dose of FAMP. Five patients developed peripheral neuropathy but there was no association with age, creatinine, dose of Ara-C, or number of courses. A patient, who also received intrathecal Ara-C, developed myelopathy. At this dose rate and duration of Ara-C peripheral neuropathy rarely arises, and cerebral toxicity is not seen. Neither toxicity was observed in 481 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with FAMP alone, by the same dose and schedule, suggesting that combination with Ara-C is important for the development of at least the peripheral neuropathy. The incidence of neurotoxicity with FAMP/Ara-C is low especially in comparison with high-dose Ara-C therapy (3 g/m2 over 2 hours). Cerebral toxicity can likely be decreased by dose reduction of FAMP in patients with increased creatinine and peripheral neuropathy decreased by detailed neurological examination before courses of FAMP/Ara-C.
The authors report the clinical and laboratory findings of a patient who had severe immune hemolytic anemia due to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). In this case, the HCTZ antibody reacted not only with other thiazide and thiazide-like drugs, but also with a chemically unrelated diuretic, ethacrynic acid. These results indicate that HCTZ antibody activity is not restricted solely to the thiazides and imply that therapy with any of the reactive drugs would be contraindicated for this patient. The serologic screening for drug reactivity may be useful for selecting alternative therapy for patients with drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia.
Hypospadias is a penile developmental abnormality that may partly result from in utero exposure to estrogenic compounds. Expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is elevated in human foreskin tissue from hypospadic patients, and in utero exposure to ethinyl estradiol (17-EE) causes ATF3 upregulation in a hypospadias mouse model. We investigated the effects of in vitro exposure to EE on ATF3 expression and promoter activity in human foreskin fibroblasts using immunocytochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blot, and the luciferase activity assay. Immunocytochemistry showed peak positive staining at 2 hours after 0.5 to 3 hours of EE treatment (0.1 microM). Western blot showed significantly increased ATF3 protein expression (P = 0.006) after EE exposure. ATF3 mRNA, as evaluated using reverse transcriptase PCR and TaqMan real-time PCR, also increased (P = 0.146). In addition, the luciferase activity assay showed that ATF3 promoter activity was significantly enhanced after 1 hour of EE exposure (P < 0.0001). Thus, EE upregulates ATF3 expression in fibroblasts in vitro, consistent with our previous results with human tissue and in vivo mouse models. ATF3 is involved in the TGF-beta epithelial-mesenchymal signaling pathway, and its involvement in hypospadias suggests that ATF3 plays a role in development of this anomaly as a result of exposure to estrogenic compounds. Its potential involvement in other manifestations of developmental endocrine disruption is worth investigating.
Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a multidomain focal adhesion protein implicated in signal transduction between integrins and growth factor receptors. Although its expression is upregulated in pulmonary and renal fibrosis, its role in the development of hepatic fibrosis remains to be determined. Therefore, we considered it important to investigate whether ILK is involved in activation of hepatic stellate cells and thus plays a role in the development of hepatic fibrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis of liver sections obtained from rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis revealed increased expression and colocalization of ILK and alpha-smooth muscle actin in hepatic stellate cells in perisinusoidal areas. In addition, hepatic stellate cells isolated from fibrotic livers expressed high levels of ILK and alpha-smooth muscle actin, and their expression was sustained in culture. In contrast, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) isolated from normal rat liver did not express ILK, but its expression was increased when the cells were activated in culture. Our studies also showed that ILK is involved in the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK, and PKB and that selective inhibition of ILK expression by siRNA results in a significant decrease in their phosphorylation. These changes were accompanied by significant inhibition of cell spreading and migration without affecting cell proliferation. In conclusion, ILK plays a key role in HSC activation and could be a possible target for antifibrogenic therapy.
A case of a 58-year-old woman with history of bilateral lung transplant secondary to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (PIZZ), who presented with a severe drug-induced cholestasis secondary to prochlorperazine is reported. After 27 months of prochlorperazine use, she developed liver failure consisting of jaundice with ascites. Computed tomography of the abdomen, abdominal ultrasonography as well as an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed no evidence for biliary obstruction. Liver biopsy demonstrated diffuse ongoing advanced chronic cholestasis, moderate portal and periportal inflammation as well as bridging fibrosis. During her hospitalization, her total bilirubin increased to 38.6 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase to 362 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase to 71 IU/L and aspartate aminotransferase to 88 IU/L. After several weeks of ursodiol therapy without clinical improvement the prochlorperazine was discontinued and was followed by a rapid improvement in her measures of liver injury. An immediate decline of her serum total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase to 21.4 mg/dL and 258 IU/L, respectively, occurred strongly suggesting the idea of a prochlorperazine-induced injury.
An additional disorder in the spectrum of thyroid related muscle disease is presented. Hypothyroid and hyperthyroid disease are both associated with a variety of muscle abnormalities, from myalgias to myopathy. Polymyositis, however, has never been reported immediately after treatment for active hyperthyroidism. A patient is presented with typical hyperthyroidism, who developed a severe proximal muscle weakness and a raised creatine phosphokinase after treatment for hyperthyroidism with propylthiouracil (100 mg orally, three times a day). Electromyography, muscle biopsy, and the course of the patient's illness were consistent with polymyositis. Whether this represents a cause-effect association or a chance occurrence is unknown. Physician awareness of the occurrence of a variety of muscle disorders including polymyositis in thyroid disease is emphasised. A brief discussion of thyroid myopathy, thionamide drug reactions, and polymyositis is included.
Inflammatory mediators, especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF), have been implicated in heart failure (HF). Thalidomide has anti-inflammatory properties and selectively inhibits TNF. Thus far, thalidomide or thalidomide analogues have not been evaluated in patients with heart failure.
Thalidomide was assessed in preclinical and clinical studies. First, isolated cardiac myocytes were pretreated with thalidomide or thalidomide analogues, and TNF production was assessed after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) provocation. Second, to determine the safety and potential efficacy of thalidomide, an open-label dose escalation safety study was conducted in seven patients with advanced heart failure.
Thalidomide and thalidomide analogues inhibited LPS-induced TNF biosynthesis in cardiac myocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Thalidomide analogues had a greater inhibitory effect on TNF production than did thalidomide. In patients with advanced HF, thalidomide was safe and potentially effective when used at lower doses. However, dose-limiting toxicity was observed in two patients. There was a significant increase in the 6-minute walk distance and a trend toward improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction and quality of life after 12 weeks of maintenance therapy with thalidomide.
Taken together these results suggest that thalidomide or its derivatives may be useful in selected patients with HF. This potential needs to be studied in larger clinical trials.
