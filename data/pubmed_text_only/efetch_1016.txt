The influence of digoxin on the systemic toxic effects of bupivacaine was studied in a rodent animal model. The experiment was undertaken with consideration to clinical situations such as pregnancy that are associated with the secretion of an endogenous digoxin-like factor. Twenty Wistar male rats, under barbiturate anesthesia and controlled ventilation, received either 5 micrograms/kg intravenous digoxin (n = 10) or saline (n = 10), blinded to the observer. Digoxin serum concentration was 1.8 +/- 0.24 ng/ml in the study group. Thirty minutes after digoxin or saline was administered, bupivacaine was infused at a constant rate of 2mg/kg/minute. The threshold doses of bupivacaine toxic effects (first ventricular arrhythmia, 25% fall of baseline heart rate, 25% fall of baseline mean arterial blood pressure, first seizure activity, isoelectric electroencephalogram, and asystole) were significantly lower in the digoxin group, as were the lethal bupivacaine serum concentrations. Digoxin, in hyperoxic nonacidotic rats, increases the cardiac and central nervous system toxicity of bupivacaine. Based on the known electrophysiologic actions of these two drugs, a synergistic toxic interaction is demonstrated.
The present study examined the levels of Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)) and type 2 receptor (AT(2)) in the brain stem and cerebral cortex of the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR-sp) after long-term treatment with three types of antihypertensive drugs: valsartan, enalapril, and amlodipine. In both tissues, expression of the AT(1) was decreased by administration of each drug. Expression of the AT(2) was decreased in the cerebral cortex by drug administration, but did not change in the brain stem. This study may contribute to elucidating the relationship between AT(1) and AT(2) expressions and the effect of antihypertensive drugs in SHR-sp brain.
Glucocorticoid hypertension was induced by oral administration of dexamethasone (DX) in male Wistar rats. The mechanism of hypertension was studied by observing the changes in plasma renin activity, urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and the pressor response to norepinephrine. Following administration of DX (0.1 mg/day), the blood pressure began to rise within 3 days and reached a plateau on the 5th day (from 108 +/- 2 to 162 +/- 7 mm Hg, mean +/- SE). On the other hand, urine volume and urinary excretion of sodium were increased. In spite of the marked natriuresis and diuresis, the administration of DX resulted in a marked decrease in the urinary excretion of PGE2. This decrease in PGE2 excretion appeared before the blood pressure rose and continued throughout the experiment. Plasma renin activity did not change. The pressor response to norepinephrine was enhanced on the 2nd day of DX treatment, at which time the blood pressure was not yet elevated, and it was further augumented on the 6th day. In the DX-treated rats, the pressor response to norepinephrine was not enhanced by administration of indomethacin, whereas the pressor response was significantly potentiated by indomethacin in control rats. These results suggest that DX-induced hypertension in rats is associated with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis leading to increased sensitivity in the vascular response to norepinephrine.
The clinical relevance of daytime sleepiness associated with carbamazepine (CBZ) and vigabatrin (VGB) was objectively assessed by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and nocturnal sleep recordings.
Twenty-six patients with partial epilepsy and mean monthly seizure frequency of 4, aged 18 to 48 years, receiving chronic monotherapy with CBZ and subsequent VGB addition for 2 months (14 patients), were compared with a group of healthy subjects. Subjective daytime sleepiness was complained by 13 patients on CBZ monotherapy and 9 patients during VGB add-on treatment.
No differences in nocturnal sleep parameters, but significantly shorter daytime sleep latencies at the MSLT, were detected in CBZ-treated patients as compared with healthy controls. Addition of VGB therapy did not further enhance objective daytime sleepiness.
Some sleepiness occurs in chronically CBZ-treated epileptic patients, which can be objectively measured by the MSLT, but it is not aggravated by add-on VGB.
To describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of emergency department visits related with ecstasy usage, determine the rate of re-visits of the patients and their related factors.
The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption.
The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months. The need for an urgent psychiatric visit (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 2.9-12.8) and hospital admission (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.5-8.4) during their first ED attendance were independently associated with a greater risk of re-attendance.
Ecstasy consumption frequently leads to an ED visit, sometimes due to severe medical complications, and at least 15% of patients will need urgent care again for drug-related problems within the next 3 years. This likelihood increases along with increased severity of the index episode (need of psychiatric consultation or hospital admission).
Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, is active against hemorrhagic fever viruses (with the exception of Ebola virus) in cell culture systems. In model infections with arenaviruses in guinea pigs and monkeys, ribavirin has demonstrated both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy. In therapeutic studies it has not prevented late-onset neurologic disease. In human cases of Lassa fever, it significantly reduces mortality when administered before day 7 of illness to persons at high risk. In rodents and monkeys infected with Rift Valley fever virus, ribavirin therapy resulted in reduced mortality; prophylactic administration to volunteers infected with sandfly fever virus, Sicilian strain, prevented development of illness. Ribavirin increased the number of survivors and the mean time to death in suckling mice infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and in suckling mice infected with Hantaan virus. In the People's Republic of China, ribavirin significantly reduced mortality in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Ribavirin has not been effective in animal models of filoviral and flaviviral infections. The only important adverse effect of ribavirin in humans is manageable, reversible anemia.
In intestinal bowel disease (IBD), immune-mediated conditions exert their effects through various cells and proinflammatory mediators. Recent data support a participation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions in IBD. Moreover, it is evident that chronic degenerative pathologies, including IBD, share comparable disease mechanisms with alteration in the autophagy mechanisms. Chronic inflammation in IBD exposes these patients to a number of signals known to have tumorigenic effects. This circuitry of inflammation and cancer modifies apoptosis and autophagy, and promotes cellular cycle progression, invasion, and angiogenesis. Melatonin has been shown as a specific antioxidant reducing oxidative damage in both lipid and aqueous cell environments. However, several studies provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of melatonin action in the colon. In this line, recent data suggest that melatonin modulates autophagy and sirtuin activity. An anti-autophagic property of melatonin has been demonstrated, and it could contribute to its anti-oncogenic activity. Nevertheless, there is no information about whether antitumoral effects of melatonin on colon cancer are dependent on autophagy. Sirtuins have pleiotropic effects on cancer development, being reported both as facilitator and as suppressor of colon cancer development. Sirtuins and melatonin are connected through the circadian clock machinery, and melatonin seems able to correct the alterations in sirtuin activity associated with several pathological conditions. Autophagy and sirtuin activities are linked through 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which switches on autophagy and increases sirtuin. The effect of melatonin on AMPK and the impact of this effect on IBD and colon cancer remain an open question.
We previously found that the 28-day oral toxicity study of glycidol at 200mg/kg/day in rats resulted in axonopathy in both the central and peripheral nervous systems and aberrations in the late-stage of hippocampal neurogenesis targeting the process of neurite extension. To capture the neuronal parameters in response to glycidol toxicity, these animals were subjected to region-specific global gene expression profiling in four regions of cerebral and cerebellar architectures, followed by immunohistochemical analysis of selected gene products. Expression changes of genes related to axonogenesis and synaptic transmission were observed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, cingulate cortex and cerebellar vermis at 200mg/kg showing downregulation in most genes. In the corpus callosum, genes related to growth, survival and functions of glial cells fluctuated their expression. Immunohistochemically, neurons expressing gene products of immediate-early genes, i.e., Arc, Fos and Jun, decreased in their number in the dentate granule cell layer, cingulate cortex and cerebellar vermis. We also applied immunohistochemical analysis in rat offspring after developmental exposure to glycidol through maternal drinking water. The results revealed increases of Arc(+) neurons at 1000ppm and Fos(+) neurons at ≥300ppm in the dentate granule cell layer of offspring only at the adult stage. These results suggest that glycidol suppressed neuronal plasticity in the brain after 28-day exposure to young adult animals, in contrast to the operation of restoration mechanism to increase neuronal plasticity at the adult stage in response to aberrations in neurogenesis after developmental exposure.
Acute exposure to the pharmacological stressor yohimbine (YOH) reinstates drug seeking in rats. The present experiments investigated whether repeated exposure to YOH during extinction training affects the time-course of extinction and the magnitude of subsequent YOH- or footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Rats trained to self-administer cocaine were given five days of extinction training, during which they were injected with YOH (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) either before or after daily extinction sessions. Following additional extinction training in the absence of YOH, animals were tested for reinstatement to a YOH (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) or footshock (20 min, intermittent, 0.9 mA per 0.5 s shock) challenge. Animals injected with YOH before daily extinction sessions showed an attenuated rate of extinction, relative to control animals. Following additional extinction training in the absence of YOH treatment, these same animals showed a marked attenuation of YOH-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. YOH treatment during extinction did not, however, affect the magnitude of reinstatement induced by footshock. These findings demonstrate that repeated exposure to a stressor during extinction training can modulate the processes governing extinction learning and the subsequent reinstatement of drug seeking induced by that stressor.
Our objectives were to summarize literature on the association of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with pesticides as a group and to evaluate associations of ALS with specific pesticides. We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies of ALS and pesticides as a group and investigated the association of ALS with specific pesticides, using data from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a cohort including 84,739 private pesticide applicators and spouses. AHS participants provided information on pesticide use at enrollment in 1993-1997. In mortality data collected through February 2010, ALS was recorded on death certificates of 41 individuals whom we compared to the remaining cohort (controls), using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age and gender to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. In the meta-analysis, ALS was associated with use of pesticides as a group (1.9, 1.1-3.1). In the AHS, ALS was not associated with pesticides as a group, but was associated with use of organochlorine insecticides (OCs) (1.6, 0.8-3.5), pyrethroids (1.4, 0.6-3.4), herbicides (1.6, 0.7-3.7), and fumigants (1.8, 0.8-3.9). ORs were elevated forever use of the specific OCs aldrin (2.1, 0.8-5.1), dieldrin (2.6, 0.9-7.3), DDT (2.1, 0.9-5.0), and toxaphene (2.0, 0.8-4.9). None of these associations was statistically significant. Similar results were observed in an analysis restricted to men. In conclusion, the meta-analysis suggests that ALS risk is associated with use of pesticides as a group, and our analysis of AHS data points to OC use in particular. The latter results are novel but based on a small number of cases and require replication in other populations.
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in treating patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), we performed a phase 2, open-label clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were adults and children 13 years and older with biopsy-proven idiopathic FSGS, proteinuria with protein of 3.5 g/d or greater while on angiotensin antagonist therapy, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or greater (>or=0.50 mL/s), and failure to achieve sustained remission with at least 1 immunosuppressive agent. Eligible patients received sirolimus doses adjusted to achieve trough levels of 5 to 15 ng/mL during the first 4 months and 10 to 20 ng/mL for the subsequent 8 months. The primary outcome was decrease in proteinuria, expressed as complete remission (protein < 0.3 g/d) or partial remission (protein >or= 50% decrease and <3.5 g/d). Six adult patients with FSGS were enrolled in the study; they had median disease duration of 4.0 years, mean age of 39 +/- 11 years, mean baseline Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-estimated GFR of 52 +/- 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (0.87 +/- 0.25 mL/s), and median baseline proteinuria with protein of 6.6 g/d (interquartile range, 4.2 to 9.4). Five patients had received cyclosporine. No patient experienced a complete or partial remission. Sirolimus therapy was stopped prematurely in 5 patients for the following reasons: (1) precipitous decrease in GFR in 4 patients after 7 to 9 months of therapy with a greater than 2-fold increase in proteinuria in 3 patients and (2) hypertriglyceridemia with triglyceride levels greater than 1,600 mg/dL (>18 mmol/L) at 5 months in 1 patient. Because of a rapid decrease in GFR with worsening proteinuria, the protocol was closed to further recruitment. We conclude that sirolimus may be associated with nephrotoxicity in some patients with FSGS, particularly those with prolonged disease duration and prior cyclosporine therapy.
About 6% to 9% of cases of membranous nephropathy develop secondary to exposure to drugs. Fluconazole is a widely used antifungal agent that was never implicated in the development of membranous nephropathy. We report the case of a patient found to have membranous nephropathy secondary to fluconazole treatment. This patient had recurrent episodes of nephrotic syndrome caused by readministration of fluconazole. This is the first reported case of membranous nephropathy caused by fluconazole treatment and the first case report of the clinical course of recurrent membranous nephropathy caused by reexposure to this medication.
We describe a case of prolonged cholestasis temporally associated with the use of itraconazole for onychomycosis. Peak bilirubin level of 32.0 mg/dl was documented approximately 2 months after discontinuation of the patient's itraconazole therapy, with symptoms of cholestasis persisting more than 1 month after the peak in bilirubin. Physicians should be aware of the potential for severe cholestasis associated with itraconazole usage.
"Ice" is a form of methamphetamine commonly used as a recreational drug in Hawaii and the Philippines, but seldom encountered in the continental United States. It differs in appearance from methamphetamine tablets, but otherwise has exactly the same molecules, only arranged in a crystalline structure. A sizeable body of in vitro, animal, and autopsy data suggest a linkage between methamphetamine use and myocardial pathology. In this report, we describe a series of eight patients who developed unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction in association with smoking crystal methamphetamine. The findings, to a large extent, resemble those with cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes. Given the widespread abuse of methamphetamine among young age groups, the recognition and primary prevention of cardiovascular toxic effects is of mounting socioeconomic importance.
The primary objective of this investigation was to examine the neuroprotective efficacy of an aqueous extract of Selaginella delicatula (a pteridophyte) employing a rotenone (ROT) Drosophila model in vivo. Aqueous extract of S. delicatula (SDAE) exhibited multiple antioxidant activity in selected chemical systems. Initially, we examined the ability of SDAE-enriched diet to modulate the levels of endogenous oxidative markers and antioxidant defenses in Drosophila melanogaster. Further, employing a co-exposure paradigm, we investigated the propensity of SDAE to protect flies against ROT-induced lethality, locomotor dysfunction, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunctions and neurotoxicity. Adult flies were fed SDAE-enriched diet (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2%) with or without ROT (500 μM) for seven consecutive days. SDAE offered concentration-dependent protection against ROT-induced lethality (30-95% protection), while the survivor flies performed better in the negative geotaxis assay suggesting attenuation of ROT-induced locomotor deficits. Biochemical analysis revealed that SDAE completely restored ROT-induced elevation in the levels of ROS, protein carbonyls and hydroperoxides in both head and body regions of flies. Elevations in the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase) and glutathione-S-transferase caused by ROT were also restored to normal levels by SDAE. Further, SDAE improved the activity levels of membrane bound enzymes viz., NADH-cytochrome c reductase and succinate dehydrogenase suggesting its propensity to protect mitochondrial integrity. Interestingly, SDAE normalized the activity levels of acetylcholinesterase and ROT-induced dopamine depletion. Collectively, these findings suggest the neuromodulatory potential of SDAE and our further studies are directed toward characterization of the nature of biomolecule/s and their mechanism of action employing relevant cell models.
The propofol infusion syndrome is a rare but potentially lethal complication resulting from a prolonged continuous administration of propofol. It was first described in the beginning of the 1990's and in recent years there have been frequent reports of problems in association with the use of propofol sedation. The cardinal signs and symptoms of the propofol infusion syndrome are metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias and a progressive, often therapy-resistant cardiac failure. The pathophysiology of this syndrome appears to involve a disturbance of mitochondrial metabolism induced by propofol. Our report involves a case of propofol infusion syndrome in a patient having undergone cardiac surgery.
Addiction to methamphetamine is a significant public health problem, and there are currently no pharmacological agents that are approved for the treatment of addiction to this powerful psychostimulant. Chronic methamphetamine use leads to cognitive dysfunction as well as numerous psychiatric, neurological, and cardiovascular complications. There is a growing body of literature implicating an important role for glutamate neurotransmission in psychostimulant addiction. In the present study, we examined the effects of the selective type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) antagonist 3-((2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)pyridine (MTEP) on intravenous self-administration of methamphetamine and reinstatement of methamphetamine-seeking behavior. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to respond for intravenous methamphetamine (0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg per infusion) or food pellets and were subsequently administered vehicle or MTEP (0.3-3 mg/kg) before drug or food self-administration on a fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement or a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. We also examined the effects of vehicle or MTEP (0.3-3 mg/kg) on cue- and drug-induced reinstatement of methamphetamine-seeking behavior as well as cue-induced reinstatement of food-seeking behavior. Our results show that MTEP dose dependently reduced the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine under FR1 and PR schedules of reinforcement without altering overall responding for food. MTEP also dose dependently prevented cue- and drug-induced reinstatement of methamphetamine-seeking behavior, but did not alter cue-induced reinstatement of food-seeking behavior. Together, these results indicate that mGluR5 receptors mediate methamphetamine reinforcement and methamphetamine-seeking behavior, and that pharmacological inhibitors of mGluR5 receptor function may represent a novel class of potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction.
The hemodynamic and metabolic changes in hypotensive state induced with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or trimetaphan (TMT) infusion were investigated in dogs. Mean arterial pressure was decreased by about 50% with 1.58 microg/kg/min of PGE1 or 45 microg/kg/min of TMT. Heart rate, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central venous pressure remained virtually unchanged in the two groups. Cardiac output was well maintained in PGE1 group, whereas cardiac output showed the tendency to decline in TMT group. Greater reduction in systemic vascular resistance was seen in PGE1 group than in TMT group. Pulmonary vascular resistance showed no significant change in PGE1 group, whereas it increased significantly in TMT group. Gradual decreases in arterial pH, PaO2 and base excess and slight but significant increase in PaCO2 was observed in PGE1 group, and these abnormalities recovered 30 min after hypotension. Abnormalities in blood gases and acid-base balance were considerably more severe and prolonged in TMT group compared with those in PGE1 group. Blood lactate and pyruvate concentrations showed no significant changes in PGE1 group, whereas substantial elevation was seen in L/P ratio especially 30 min after induction of hypotension in TMT group. Oxygen consumption showed minimal changes in PGE1 group, whereas a significant decrease was observed in TMT group. The conclusions derived from these results are as follows; 1) PGE1 maintained cardiac output better than TMT, probably because of its direct inotropic action on the heart, and of its greater reduction of systemic vascular resistance than TMT. 2) PGE1 seemed to provide the better blood perfusion throughout the body than TMT. 3) PGE1 showed less possibility to produce the metabolic derangement compared with TMT.
Methamphetamine has been recognized as a common cause of acute toxic hepatitis in adults with clinical and histologic features indistinguishable from acute viral hepatitis. Clinical presentation of methamphetamine hepatotoxicity ranges from mild acute hepatitis with prompt recovery to fulminant hepatic failure. The pathophysiology of this hepatotoxicity is not well elucidated. Prenatal exposure to methamphetamine has been linked to intrauterine growth retardation and variety of withdrawal symptoms. Neonatal cholestasis is rare but serious problem that indicates hepatobiliary dysfunction and has several categories of etiologies. These include infectious, metabolic, endocrine, toxic, structural, familial, and autoimmune disorders. Cholestatic hepatitis is a recognized complication of exposure to some drugs including carbamazepine and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
A 35-week preterm, appropriate for gestational age, white girl was born to a 39-year-old mother who had no prenatal care. The mother's urine drug screen revealed methamphetamine. The baby passed pale meconium and her subsequent stools were hypo-pigmented. A detailed work up was done and was unremarkable except for hepatobiliary scintigraphy, with no activity noted in the small bowel on delayed imaging. An operative cholangiogram and liver biopsy were performed. The cholangiogram revealed patent bile ducts. Liver biopsy was consistent with acute viral or toxic hepatitis. Gradual drop of bilirubin was noted. With negative extensive work up for other etiology, known hepatotoxicity of methamphetamine, early onset of cholestasis that improved without specific therapy, it is strongly suspected that prenatal exposure to methamphetamine is the most likely culprit in this patient.
This is the first recorded case of neonatal cholestasis related to prenatal exposure to methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is considered the fastest-growing illicit drug in United States. Hence, prenatal exposure to methamphetamine is expected to rise. Healthcare providers should become aware of the possibility of methamphetamine effect on the fetal liver. Raising awareness of the expectant mothers through the healthcare profession may reduce the risk of this condition.
Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) has been identified as a rate-limiting enzyme of mammalian triglyceride catabolism. Deletion of the ATGL gene in mice results in severe lipid accumulation in a variety of tissues including the heart. In the present study we investigated cardiac function in ATGL-deficient mice and the potential therapeutic effects of the PPARα and γ agonists Wy14,643 and rosiglitazone, respectively.
Hearts isolated from wild-type (WT) mice and ATGL(-/-) mice treated with Wy14,643 (PPARα agonist), rosiglitazone (PPARγ agonist) or vehicle were perfused at a constant flow using the Langendorff technique. Left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume relationships were established, and the response to adrenergic stimulation was determined with noradrenaline (NA).
Hearts from ATGL(-/-) mice generated higher LV end-diastolic pressure and lower LV developed pressure as a function of intracardiac balloon volume compared to those from WT mice. Likewise, passive wall stress was increased and active wall stress decreased in ATGL(-/-) hearts. Contractile and microvascular responses to NA were substantially reduced in ATGL(-/-) hearts. Cardiac contractility was improved by treating ATGL(-/-) mice with the PPARα agonist Wy14,643 but not with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone.
Our results indicate that lipid accumulation in mouse hearts caused by ATGL gene deletion severely affects systolic and diastolic function, as well as the response to adrenergic stimulation. The beneficial effects of Wy14,643 suggest that the cardiac phenotype of these mice is partially due to impaired PPARα signalling.
Parkinsonian symptoms and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) are often considered to occur first, and to predominate, in the upper limbs. We studied the topography, type, sequence, and severity of LIDs in 20 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing LIDs for less than 6 months (Hoehn and Yahr stage II-III; average age at onset of PD, 57 years; average duration of PD, 7.2 years; percent of improvement with levodopa > 50) and compared them with the initial site, form, and evolution of the patient's motor disability. Parkinsonism started in the foot in six of 20 patients. Motor disability in the "off" state was similar in upper and lower extremities, except for akinesia, which was worse in the lower limbs. A careful interview indicated that LIDs had started in the foot in all patients. After administration of a single dose of levodopa ("levodopa test"), LIDs appeared in all patients as dystonia of the foot homolateral to the side most affected by PD (onset-of-dose dyskinesia). LIDs were preceded by "off" dystonia (dystonic foot) in six patients and were followed by mid-dose dyskinesia in eight. This is consistent with an early loss of dopaminergic innervation corresponding somatotopically to the foot area. The similarities among initial LIDs, early morning dystonia, and onset-of-dose dyskinesia suggest a similar pathophysiology.
There have been several reports of instillation of buprenorphine in the intact epidural space in an attempt to control postoperative pain, but none in which an absorbable gelatin sponge soaked with buprenorphine is placed directly in the epidural space. In the present study, carried out on 30 patients (study group) undergoing noncervical laminectomies, 0.3 mg buprenorphine diluted to 5 mL with normal saline soaked into an absorbable gelatin sponge was placed in the epidural space under direct vision. In 30 other patients (control group) undergoing laminectomies, absorbable gelatin sponge soaked with 5 mL normal saline was placed in the epidural space. Pulse rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, pain score by visual analog scale, duration of analgesia, and adverse effects, if any, were noted preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours. The presence of any neurologic symptoms was also assessed at these time intervals as well as on the seventh postoperative day. The authors observed that changes in pulse rate, mean arterial pressure, and respiratory rate were not statistically significant between the control and the study groups. The pain relief score, duration of pain relief (14.8 +/- 0.77 hours in the study group vs. 0.66 +/- 0.15 hours in the control group), and sedation were significantly better in the study group. No patient demonstrated any respiratory depression (respiratory rate <12/min), bradycardia, pruritus, or neurologic pressure symptoms, although the incidence of nausea was higher in the study group.
Stress response neuroadaptation has been repeatedly implicated in animal addiction models for many drugs, including nicotine. Programmatic laboratory research that examines the stress response of nicotine-deprived humans is necessary to confirm that stress neuroadaptations observed in animal models generalize to humans.
Two experiments tested the prediction that nicotine deprivation selectively increases startle response associated with anxiety during unpredictable threat but not fear during imminent, predictable threat. Dependent smokers (n = 117) were randomly assigned to 24-hour nicotine-deprived or nondeprived groups and participated in one of two experiments wherein electric shock was administered either unpredictably (noncontingent shock; Experiment 1) or predictably (cue-contingent shock; Experiment 2).
Nicotine deprivation increased overall startle response in Experiment 1, which involved unpredictable administration of shock. Age of first cigarette and years of daily smoking were significant moderators of this deprivation effect. Self-reported withdrawal symptoms also predicted startle response during unpredictable shock. In contrast, nicotine deprivation did not alter overall or fear-potentiated startle in Experiment 2, which involved predictable administration of shock.
These results provide evidence that startle response during unpredictable threat may be a biomarker of stress neuroadaptations among smokers in nicotine withdrawal. Contrast of results across unpredictable versus predictable shock experiments provides preliminary evidence that these stress neuroadaptations manifest selectively as anxiety during unpredictable threat rather than in every stressful context. Individual differences in unpredictable threat startle response associated with withdrawal symptoms, age of first cigarette, and years daily smoking link this laboratory biomarker to clinically relevant indexes of addiction risk and relapse.
