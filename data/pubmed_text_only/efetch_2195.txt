A 39-year-old woman had an embolic upper division middle cerebral artery branch occlusion 3 hours after smoking the free base of cocaine ("crack"). Radionuclide ventriculography demonstrated cardiomyopathy, and echocardiography documented a left atrial thrombus. This case demonstrates that embolism is one mechanism of ischemic stroke after cocaine use, and that cardiomyopathy, possibly cocaine induced, may be the source of embolus. A cardiac source of embolus should be sought in patients with cocaine-associated cerebral infarction.
The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of the NO precursor L-arginine and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NORAG) on amphetamine-induced stereotypy, haloperidol-induced catalepsy and conditioned avoidance response (CAR) in rats. Amphetamine (3 mg/kg i.p.) was used for the induction of stereotypy, while for the induction of catalepsy and CAR, haloperidol (2 mg/kg i.p.) was used. This study was divided into 2 parts--acute administration of L-arginine (150 mg/kg i.p.) and L-NOARG (50 mg/kg i.p.) and chronic administration of L-arginine (150 mg/kg/day i.p.) and L-NOARG (50 mg/kglday i.p.) for 5 days. We found that L-arginine inhibited amphetamine-induced stereotypy and haloperidol-induced catalepsy, but intensified CAR. On the other hand, L-NOARG intensified stereotypy and catalepsy but inhibited CAR. Also, there was no significant difference between the scores of acute and chronic administration of L-arginine and L-NOARG. It is concluded from our study that nitric oxide produces conflicting results on various models of psychosis. L-arginine might be useful as an antipsychotic without causing extrapyramidal symptoms.
Deficits in dopaminergic function may contribute to hypertrophy of striatal structures associated with typical neuroleptic treatment. In light of a body of research that has associated chronic cocaine use with extrapyramidal symptoms and striatal dopaminergic depletion, the authors looked for evidence of striatal dysmorphology in patients with chronic cocaine dependence.
Caudate, putamen, and total brain volumes were quantified by means of magnetic resonance imaging in 25 cocaine-dependent and 20 healthy subjects.
Normalized caudate and putamen volumes were 3.40% and 9.18% larger, respectively, in the cocaine-dependent subjects.
These observations suggest that deficits in dopaminergic function associated with cocaine dependence may contribute to striatal hypertrophy.
Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) has been investigated as an empirical antifungal treatment for neutropenic patients with persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO). We studied the safety and efficacy of low dose ABLC (1 mg/kg/day) for empirical treatment of neutropenic FUO. Sixty-one patients with hematologic malignancies developing 69 episodes of neutropenic FUO after chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were included in the study. The median patient age was 47 years (18-68). The median duration of neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/l) was 17 days (7-45) and the median duration of ABLC therapy was 8 days (2-19). Thirteen patients (19%) suffered from mild to moderate infusion-related adverse events. Creatinine levels were stable in 42 cases (61%), improved in 9 (13%) and deteriorated in 18 (26%), with no other significant toxicities. Among 67 evaluable episodes, the response rate (resolution of fever during the period of neutropenia without developing a fungal infection) was 67%, while 33% were treatment failures. Low-dose ABLC is safe, well tolerated and seems to be at least as effective as c-AmB for empirical antifungal therapy of FUO. Randomized trials at this dose level comparing ABLC with c-AmB or other lipid formulations are warranted.
In this study, we examined the effects of switching from acarbose or voglibose to miglitol in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients for 3 months on gene expression of inflammatory cytokines/cytokine-like factors in peripheral leukocytes and on glucose fluctuations. We enrolled 47 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged 26 to 81 years, with hemoglobin A(₁c) levels ranging from 6.5% to 7.9% and who were treated with the highest approved dose of acarbose (100 mg per meal) or voglibose (0.3 mg per meal) in combination with insulin or sulfonylurea. Their prior α-glucosidase inhibitors were switched to a medium dose of miglitol (50 mg per meal), and the new treatments were maintained for 3 months. Forty-three patients completed the 3-month study and were analyzed. The switch to miglitol for 3 months did not affect hemoglobin A(₁c), fasting glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, or C-reactive protein levels, or adverse events other than hypoglycemia symptoms. Hypoglycemia symptoms and glucose fluctuations were significantly improved by the switch. The expression of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and S100a4/6/9/10/11/12 genes in peripheral leukocytes, and the serum tumor necrosis factor-α protein levels were suppressed by switching to miglitol. Miglitol reduces glucose fluctuations and gene expression of inflammatory cytokines/cytokine-like factors in peripheral leukocytes of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients more than other α-glucosidase inhibitors and with fewer adverse effects.
To identify the predictors of fatigue 30 days after completing adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and whether differences are observed between a behavioral sleep intervention and a healthy-eating attention control group in predicting fatigue.
Descriptive, exploratory, secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial.
Outpatient oncology patients in a midwestern U. S. city.
96 women, ages 29-83 years, 72% married, 95% white, diagnosed with stage I-IIIA breast cancer, receiving adjuvant anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy.
Participants were randomized to a behavioral sleep intervention group or an attention control group. Participants completed data collection prior to and during the peak and rebound days of the initial chemotherapy treatment cycle and after the last treatment.
Fatigue, circadian rhythms of activity, objective and subjective sleep-wake, and objective and subjective activity-rest.
Predictors of fatigue were less total sleep time prior to treatment, higher fatigue prior to treatment and at the peak, and less energy upon awakening on rebound days. In the control group, predictors of higher fatigue were higher fatigue prior to treatment, higher body mass index, higher number of positive lymph nodes, and less daytime dysfunction. For the intervention group, lower peak activity at the peak of initial treatment differentially predicted fatigue.
Results suggest the sleep intervention group participants who maintained activity balanced with sleep at the peak of the initial treatment benefited most from the intervention.
Nurses should screen for fatigue prior to initial chemotherapy treatment and at regular intervals, further assess for poor sleep in patients who report fatigue of 4 or higher (on a 0-10 scale), and use evidence-based guidelines to select appropriate interventions.
A young woman with oral apraxia and a well-defined brain lesion on CT scan developed buccolingual dyskinesia lasting 40 days after low phenobarbital (PB) doses. Disruption of the corticostriatal glutamatergic pathway from areas 6 and 4 may have been important both in causing oral apraxia and in lowering the threshold for PB-induced buccolingual dyskinesia.
This paper summarizes a group of presentations and panel discussions on chronic insomnia at the 2001 NCDEU meeting. The presentations and discussions focused on the twin issues of efficacy and concerns of abuse liability with long-term hypnotic therapy. The panel concluded that insomnia may be an epidemiological marker for a variety of difficulties including accidents, increased health care utilization and subsequent development of major depression. Whether or not treatment of insomnia will prevent these long-term problems has not yet been determined. Since the mid-1980s there has been a rapid rise in the off-label use of antidepressants, particularly trazodone, for treating insomnia. Some participants expressed concern at the lack of data for this practice, particularly the absence of dose-response and tolerance information, and noted that the small amount of efficacy data available is not encouraging. Similarly, there are minimal data to support the use of antihistamines as sleep aids; moreover, their side effect profile and interactions with other drugs may be under appreciated. The limited data available on nightly long-term usage of the newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, primarily of six-months' duration, suggest an absence of tolerance, but more data for both nightly and non-nightly administration are needed. Insomniacs tend to show therapy-seeking, rather than drug-seeking behavior, and patients without histories of drug abuse are unlikely to self-escalate dosage of currently available hypnotics. There is fairly good agreement on the characteristics of an ideal hypnotic. All currently available agents, while effective and safe, do not achieve this ideal. The next few years are likely to see the appearance of a variety of agents with new and promising mechanisms of action.
The ability of clozapine and haloperidol to antagonize the depression of firing rate produced by d-amphetamine and apomorphine in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens was tested in immobilized, locally anesthetized rats. In the neostriatum, an intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 mg/kg d-amphetamine or 1.0 mg/kg apomorphine produced a prolonged inhibition of neuronal activity that was reversed by a subjsequent injection of either 20 mg/kg clozapine or 2.0 mg/kg haloperidol. An analysis of the onset and magnitude of the blockade revealed that clozapine was more effective than haloperidol in reversing the amphetamine response but that both antipsychotic drugs produced a comparable blockade of the apomorphine-induced depression. Similar results were obtained in the nucleus accumbens. The data indicate that although clozapine acts equieffectively in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens, this atypical antipsychotic drug, aside from blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors, may exert at least some of its effects by preventing dopamine release.
To determine whether a difference exists in perceived pain during preprocedure anesthetic injection for bone marrow biopsy between buffered and unbuffered lidocaine, to determine whether pain levels change over time, and to investigate relationships between perceived pain scores and other variables.
A double-blind, randomized, experimental, crossover design.
A large hospital in the midwestern region of the United States.
48 patients undergoing bone marrow biopsy.
The patients served as their own controls for the bilateral procedure. A 100 mm visual analog scale measured pain. A demographic questionnaire gathered the between-subjects exploratory variables.
Perceived pain scores and type of lidocaine anesthetic solution (buffered versus unbuffered).
Participants reported significantly lower pain scores on the side anesthetized with buffered lidocaine compared with the side anesthetized with unbuffered lidocaine. Higher pain scores were reported on the treatment side for participants who had received more than two surgical procedures. Patients who were members of a minority group had higher mean pain scores than Caucasians on the control side.
Buffered lidocaine is superior to unbuffered lidocaine as an anesthetic for bone marrow biopsy procedures.
Advanced practice nurses perform a significant number of bone marrow biopsies and aim to improve patient comfort during invasive procedures. Use of unbuffered lidocaine should be questioned.
In a randomised controlled trial in 427 men with chronic stable angina continuous use of 5 mg transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) showed no advantage over placebo in terms of efficacy (anginal attack rates and sublingual GTN consumption) or quality of life (as measured with the sickness impact profile and a health index of disability). Patients on the active drug reported headaches more frequently than patients on placebo, and a higher proportion of them withdrew from the trial because of headache. Quality-of-life measurements showed a significant adverse effect of active treatment, principally in the social interaction dimension of the sickness impact profile. A similar effect was observed in placebo patients when crossed to active treatment in a 4-week single-blind period. The results suggest no benefit in the relief of chest pain from 5 mg transdermal GTN when used continuously.
There are several reports on cardiac adverse reactions attributed to the antimigraine drug sumatriptan in the recent literature. In order to assess the frequency and the character of adverse reactions to sumatriptan, a postmarketing cohort study was performed one year after registration of the drug in The Netherlands. With assistance of 86% of the drug dispensing general practitioners in The Netherlands, 1727 patients who had received sumatriptan were traced in July, 1992. Via their general practitioners, a questionnaire about use of sumatriptan, adverse reactions and other medication was sent to the patients in December 1992. During the study period, seven patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 1720 remaining patients, 1202 (70%) responded to the questionnaire, of whom 1187 had actually used sumatriptan. The most frequently reported suspected adverse reactions were paraesthesiae (139 patients, 95% CI 9.9%-13.5%) and dizziness (96 patients, 95% CI 6.5%-9.7%). Chest pain after use of sumatriptan was reported by 94 patients (7.9%, 95% CI 6.4%-9.4%), and according to the close temporal relationship with the intake of sumatriptan and a positive rechallenge, a causal relationship was probable in most of those patients. The frequency of chest pain attributed to sumatriptan was higher in females (9.0% vs 4.6%; relative risk 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.4). Age and hypertension were not associated with chest pain attributed to sumatriptan. Dyspnoea attributed to sumatriptan was reported by 26 patients (2.2%), and was associated with obstructive lung disease (relative risk 5.4 95% CI 1.7-16.9).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The occurrence of a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) with sodium valproate has been rarely described in the literature. We present a 46-year-old patient, admitted to the Emergency Room for confusion and acute agitation. The exploration showed a severe hyponatraemia induced by sodium valproate, prescribed for a type I bipolar disorder. This article addresses both somatic and psychiatric issues in the differential diagnosis of confusion and agitation.
The host response to intravascular, Gram-negative bacteria includes profound immunologic, hematologic and physiologic changes. Numerous host defense mechanisms are activated by Gram-negative bacteria, including the complement system. Activation of the complement system leads to cleavage of C5 with subsequent generation of the C5a anaphylatoxin peptide. C5a mediates potent, proinflammatory activities by binding to the C5a receptor (C5aR, CD88). In this study, we report the targeted disruption of the murine C5aR gene (C5aR-/- mice) and define the role of the C5aR in a model of Gram-negative bacteremia. Following an intravenous infusion of heat-killed Escherichia coli, the C5aR-/- mice were completely protected from the mortality suffered by their wild-type littermates (P<0.001). The C5aR-/- mice were also significantly (P=0.008) more resistant to mortality following an intravenous infusion of purified E. coli endotoxin compared to the wild-type littermates. In addition, the C5aR-/- mice were resistant to the thrombocytopenia and hemoconcentration observed in wild-type animals. Lethality in the wild-type mice was reversed by pre-treatment with either the histamine antagonist diphenhydramine or triprolidine. The wild-type littermates were also rescued following pre-treatment with the basophil and mast cell-stabilizing agent - cromolyn sodium. Collectively, these data demonstrate that not only is the absence of the C5aR protective in E. coli bacteremia, but that C5aR-dependent histamine release plays a major role in shock induced by Gram-negative septicemia. Moreover, they provide additional in vivo evidence that C3a and C5a have divergent biological functions in Gram-negative bacteremia and shock.
Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are found in applications such oil/water repellents for clothing fabrics, carpets, food packaging, lubricants, surfactants and fire extinguishers. PFCs are persistent in the environment. They have been found in humans and in wildlife. We reported earlier that persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as DDT, PCBs and BFRs, caused developmental neurotoxic defects in mice, manifested as persistent aberrations in spontaneous behaviour, habituation capability, learning and memory, and changes in the cholinergic system in adults, when mice were exposed during a critical period of neonatal brain development. The present study was conducted to see whether PFCs can cause similar developmental neurotoxic effects as earlier observed for POPs as PCBs and PBDEs. NMRI male mice were exposed to a single-oral dose, either 1.4 or 21 micromol/kg body weight of PFOS (0.75 or 11.3 mg), PFOA (0.58 or 8.70 mg), or PFDA (0.72 or 10.8 mg), via a metal gastric-tube at the age of 10 days. The control animals received in the same manner 10 ml/kg body weight of the 20% fat emulsion vehicle. Spontaneous behaviour (locomotion, rearing, and total activity), and habituation were observed in 2- and 4-month-old mice. The susceptibility of the cholinergic system was explored in a nicotine-induced spontaneous behaviour test in 4-month-old mice. Deranged spontaneous behaviour was observed in mice exposed to PFOS and PFOA, manifested as reduced and/or lack of habituation and hyperactivity in adult mice. These effects were also seen to worse with age. Neonatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA affected the cholinergic system, manifested as a hypoactive response to nicotine, compared to a hyperactive response to nicotine in controls. These developmental neurotoxic effects are similar to those we reported earlier for PCBs and PBDEs. This suggests that PFOS and PFOA be included in the group of POPs known to be developmental neurotoxicants.
Extravasation of a chemotherapeutic agent is one of the most frequent complications in cancer patients. Full-thickness skin necrosis often occurs after extravasation. Alternative approaches to treatment are local wound care, elevation, and hypothermia. It was shown that heparin prevents skin necrosis. In this experimental study, the effects of heparin fractions on the prevention of skin necrosis were compared by applying an extravasation model of Adriamycin in rats. Forty Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 250 to 300 g were used. A total of 0.3 ml doxorubicin hydrochloride was administered subcutaneously to all rats. Ten minutes later, in the control group (group I), 1 ml normal saline was administered subcutaneously. In the first experimental group (group II), 100 U per day heparin sodium was administered in a volume of 1 ml subcutaneously. In the second experimental group (group III), nadroparin calcium (5 anti-Xa U per kilogram per day) was administered. In the third and last experimental group (group IV), dalteparin sodium (5 anti-Xa U per kilogram per day) was administered. All drugs were administered for 2 weeks. Necrotic areas were measured 4 weeks later. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and the Mann-Whitney test. Heparin fractions caused a decreased ulcer rate and size than controls ( < 0.05). There was no superiority among heparin fractions. The authors think that low-molecular weight heparins are preferred, considering the higher risk of bleeding with unfractionated heparin.
Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) is a genetically heterogeneous, neonatally lethal malformation and the most common form of syndromic neural tube defect (NTD). To date, several MKS-associated genes have been identified whose protein products affect ciliary function. Here we show that mutations in MKS1, MKS3 and CEP290 (also known as NPHP6) either can cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) or may have a potential epistatic effect on mutations in known BBS-associated loci. Five of six families with both MKS1 and BBS mutations manifested seizures, a feature that is not a typical component of either syndrome. Functional studies in zebrafish showed that mks1 is necessary for gastrulation movements and that it interacts genetically with known bbs genes. Similarly, we found two families with missense or splice mutations in MKS3, in one of which the affected individual also bears a homozygous nonsense mutation in CEP290 that is likely to truncate the C terminus of the protein. These data extend the genetic stratification of ciliopathies and suggest that BBS and MKS, although distinct clinically, are allelic forms of the same molecular spectrum.
Iron (Fe) status is altered in human and experimental animal hepatopathies. In dogs limited data are available. The aim of this study was to investigate serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), percentage transferrin saturation (SAT) and Fe status in the liver of dogs with experimentally induced hepatopathy.
Fourteen 1-year-old dogs were divided into two equal groups. In order for hepatopathy to be induced, 0.25 mL/kg body weight of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) solution was administered once daily, orally, for a 10-week period in group B dogs, while group A dogs were used as controls. SI, TIBC and SAT values were measured 3 times before the beginning (baseline value) and 10 times at weekly intervals during the experiment. Liver samples, obtained before the administration of CCl4 and at the end of the experimental period (10 weeks), were subjected to Fe determination, as well as to histopathological and histochemical analysis.
At the end of the experiment SI, TIBC and liver iron concentration, as well as liver total iron score were significantly increased in group B dogs. Distribution of granular hemosiderin iron in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and portal triads was noticed. Positive correlations were found between SI and liver Fe concentration, as well as histochemically determined Fe. Moreover, positive correlations were evident between liver fibrosis and serum, as well as liver Fe values.
Experimentally induced chronic hepatopathy in dogs causes Fe status disturbances. Increased serum and liver iron concentration produces liver histopathological deterioration and it may be worth attention during laboratory evaluation in canine hepatopathy.
The many side effects and sequelae of maternal ingestion of diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy are reviewed and the review focuses on the effects of female hormones on the fetus in terms of public health consequences. DES affects female offspring in many ways: clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix; possible risks of uterine, ovarian, and breast cancers; infertility; and pregnancy complications. In DES-exposed males analogous problems are surfacing: testicular cancer, congenital anomalies of the urogenital tract, and infertility. Other effects of female hormones for which strong documentation exists are major malformations in general, cardiovascular malformations, and perhaps, limb reduction deformities. The public health consequences of intrauterine exposure to DES are considerable. Congenital malformations in urogenital tracts of offspring will require long-term follow-ups and careful watching to avoid development of cancers and other malformations in the affected regions. The social cost of long-term follow-up might be computed monetarily or on another scale, such as the psychological impact. Either way, the cost is high. Since DES has been proven a culprit in offspring malformations, the burden of proof that oral contraceptives in general do not provoke similar offspring changes is on the health community.
Serum uric acid concentrations are correlated with gout and clinical entities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In the genome-wide association study KORA (Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg) F3 500K (n = 1,644), the most significant SNPs associated with uric acid concentrations mapped within introns 4 and 6 of SLC2A9, a gene encoding a putative hexose transporter (effects: -0.23 to -0.36 mg/dl per copy of the minor allele). We replicated these findings in three independent samples from Germany (KORA S4 and SHIP (Study of Health in Pomerania)) and Austria (SAPHIR; Salzburg Atherosclerosis Prevention Program in Subjects at High Individual Risk), with P values ranging from 1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.0 x 10(-32). Analysis of whole blood RNA expression profiles from a KORA F3 500K subgroup (n = 117) showed a significant association between the SLC2A9 isoform 2 and urate concentrations. The SLC2A9 genotypes also showed significant association with self-reported gout. The proportion of the variance of serum uric acid concentrations explained by genotypes was about 1.2% in men and 6% in women, and the percentage accounted for by expression levels was 3.5% in men and 15% in women.
Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and great apes, which have lost hepatic uricase activity, leading to uniquely high serum uric acid concentrations (200-500 microM) compared with other mammals (3-120 microM). About 70% of daily urate disposal occurs via the kidneys, and in 5-25% of the human population, impaired renal excretion leads to hyperuricemia. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout, an inflammatory arthritis that results from deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joint. We have identified genetic variants within a transporter gene, SLC2A9, that explain 1.7-5.3% of the variance in serum uric acid concentrations, following a genome-wide association scan in a Croatian population sample. SLC2A9 variants were also associated with low fractional excretion of uric acid and/or gout in UK, Croatian and German population samples. SLC2A9 is a known fructose transporter, and we now show that it has strong uric acid transport activity in Xenopus laevis oocytes.
The typical form of acute gout can be clinically diagnosed. The term 'complicated gout' is used if there are more than three acute attacks of gout per year, tophi or urate stones in the urinary tracts. In the case of recurrent probable acute gout, a diagnostic fine needle aspirate from the joint during an attack is indicated. First choice treatment of acute gout consists of NSAIDs. Colchicine is the second choice treatment and the third choice treatment consists of corticosteroids. Excessive alcohol use should be limited. Treatment of chronic gout depends on the uric acid excretion in the 24-hour urine. If the level of excretion is too low, the first choice should be benzbromarone, and if the uric acid output is too high, allopurinol should be the treatment of first choice. Increased fluid intake is recommended; maintenance treatment with colchicine is not advised. Consultation with or referral to a rheumatologist is indicated in the case of doubt about the diagnosis of 'acute gout' or 'complicated gout', or (suspected) bacterial arthritis and insufficient treatment effect.
Buprenorphine in sublingual formulation was recently introduced to the American market for treatment of opioid dependence. We report a series of 5 toddlers with respiratory and mental-status depression after unintentional buprenorphine exposure. Despite buprenorphine's partial agonist activity and ceiling effect on respiratory depression, all children required hospital admission and either opioid-antagonist therapy or mechanical ventilation. Results of routine urine toxicology screening for opioids were negative in all cases. Confirmatory testing was sent for 1 child and returned with a positive result. The increasing use of buprenorphine as a home-based therapy for opioid addiction in the United States raises public health concerns for the pediatric population.
A case of stable blunt renal trauma is presented. The patient a 20-year-old pregnant woman, was heparinized and 2 days later developed severe renal bleeding. Her kidney returned to near normal with nonoperative measures. Care should be taken in the decision to heparinize such patients following renal trauma because of the possibility of delayed hemorrhage.
Total external ophthalmoplegia was observed in a patient following oral administration of phenytoin, although the state of consciousness was relatively unimpaired and the plasma phenytoin level was within the recommended therapeutic range. This report demonstrates the potency of phenytoin to act selectively on the vestibulo-ocular system. Recognition of such association may be important as regards further investigations aimed at excluding structural brainstem lesions.
Between 1997 and 2002, 48 data sets from the hippocampus were produced on samples from the Stanley Neuropathology Consortium. From these data sets, 224 total measures were available from the various subdivisions of the hippocampus. An integrative analysis of these measures was performed using a multivariate, nonparametric analysis of variance (ANOVA). ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons indicated that parvalbumin-containing cells in CA2 were reduced in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In addition, reelin protein in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was decreased in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression at the trend level of statistical significance (P=0.065). These results strongly suggest a dysfunction of inhibitory GABA-ergic interneurons in severe mental illness. Without correction for multiple comparisons, 31 measures were abnormal in at least one disease, whereas 11 measures would be expected to appear abnormal by chance. Abnormal molecules included measures of synaptic density or neuronal plasticity (reelin, SNAP-25, BDNF, Complexin I and II), as well as parvalbumin, tyrosine receptor kinase A, glucocorticoid receptors, glutamate NR1 receptor subunits, serotonin 5HT2(A) and 5HT1(B) receptors, and dopamine D(5) receptors.
Recent reports suggest an increased incidence of endometrial cancer in breast cancer patients under long-term adjuvant tamoxifen (TAM) treatment. The Authors describe two cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma among 80 post-menopausal patients affected with breast cancer and treated with TAM.
