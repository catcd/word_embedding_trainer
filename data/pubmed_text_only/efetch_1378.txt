Adverse hepatic reactions to nitrofurantoin therapy are well reported and range from acute cholestatic or hepatitic injury to chronic active hepatitis [R G. Penn & J.P. Griffin (1982) Br. Med. J., 284, 1440-1442]. Neurological side-effects, predominantly sensorimotor peripheral polyneuropathy, have also been documented [R.G. Penn & J.P. Griffin (1982)]. We report the first case of combined neurological and hepatic reaction to nitrofurantoin; this occurred during repeated treatment with the drug.
Hereditary hydronephrosis was detected in all of the male mice of DDD inbred strain maintained at the National Institute of Animal Health Japan, but in only a few of the females. From the standpoint that male hormones are related to the development of hydronephrosis in this strain, the incidence and severity of the disease were investigated in gonadectomized mice treated with testosterone. In the males, the incidence of hydronephrosis was 50% (7/14) in the control (gonadectomized) group, and 73.3% (11/15), 100% (13/13) and 100% (12/12) in the 0.1 mg, 3.3 mg and 10 mg treatment groups respectively. The same tendency was observed in the female animals, though the incidence in each group was not so high. In both sexes the degree of severity increased in proportion to the dose of testosterone administrated. Blood testosterone levels were higher in intact DDD mice than in C57BL/6 mice, which had normal kidneys in both sexes. These results suggest that male hormones play a significant role in the development of hydronephrosis.
FANCG was the third Faconi anaemia gene identified and proved to be identical to the previously cloned XRCC9 gene. We present the pathogenic mutations and sequence variants we have so far identified in a panel of FA-G patients. Mutation screening was performed by PCR, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and protein truncation tests. Altogether 18 mutations have been determined in 20 families - 97% of all expected mutant alleles. All mutation types have been found, with the exception of large deletions, the large majority is predicted to lead to shortened proteins. One stop codon mutation, E105X, has been found in several German patients and this founder mutation accounts for 44% of the mutant FANCG alleles in German FA-G patients. Comparison of clinical phenotypes shows that patients homozygous for this mutation have an earlier onset of the haematological disorder than most other FA-G patients. The mouse Fancg sequence was established in order to evaluate missense mutations. A putative missense mutation, L71P, in a possible leucine zipper motif may affect FANCG binding of FANCA and seems to be associated with a milder clinical phenotype.
The cause of the hypercholesterolemia that characterizes the nephrotic syndrome has never been adequately explained. The present study examines the possibility that enhanced availability of the cholesterol precursor, mevalonic acid, to the liver in the nephrotic state may result in increased hepatic cholesterogenesis. In normal animals, the kidneys are known to be the major site of the metabolism of circulating mevalonate to both cholesterol and CO2. Previous studies, using perfusion of isolated, intact kidneys, have shown that the excretion and metabolism of mevalonate are both impaired in nephrosis. The present investigation has demonstrated in vivo that puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis results in a 25% reduction in the oxidation of mevalonate to CO2. In the same nephrotic animals, cholesterogenesis from circulating mevalonate was significantly increased in both liver and carcass. In addition, liver slices from nephrotic animals incorporated increased amounts of [5-14C]mevalonate into cholesterol when calculated per whole liver, but not per gram of liver. Oxidation of mevalonic acid by kidney slices was significantly reduced, whether expressed as per gram of tissue or per whole organ. HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl) reductase activity in liver of nephrotic animals was significantly increased. We conclude that, in the nephrotic state, impaired mevalonate metabolism by the kidney may contribute to enhanced cholesterogenesis by increasing delivery of mevalonate to liver and carcass; in addition, nephrosis appears to provide an undefined stimulus for HMG-CoA reductase activity in the liver, thereby providing an additional enhancement of hepatic cholesterogenesis.
Among 2,656 patients receiving heparin sodium therapy, bleeding was a dose-related phenomenon that occurred most commonly among women, severely ill patients, and patients who received asprin during heparin therapy. Except for dose, factors that predisposed patients to bleeding were more strongly associated with major bleeding than with minor bleeding. Heavy alcohol drinkers were at particularly high risk for major bleeding episodes during heparinization. The seven-day cumulative risk for any bleeding was 9.1%. Risk was greatest on the third day of heparin administration.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is thrombogenic as a consequence of multiple hemostatic effects and endothelial damage. Thalidomide has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH in the absence of venous thromboembolism has also been described in MM patients during thalidomide treatment.
Detection of clinical and subclinical nonthromboembolic PH in MM patients after thalidomide treatment.
Eighty-two patients, 46-82 years (median age 61 years), 42 males, were studied. They underwent echocardiographic study at baseline, 1 month thereafter, 6 months later and whenever symptoms indicating deterioration of cardiac function appeared. Echocardiographic signs of PH were especially identified.
Clinical and echocardiographic evaluation revealed four patients (out of 82 patients, 4.87%) with PH. Nonimaging and imaging diagnostic methods excluded thromboembolic PH. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant correlation between structural heart disease and PH (r = 14.078; P = 0.008). No significant correlation between age (r = 0.770; P = 0.724), gender (r = 1.157; P = 0.285), International Staging System (ISS) (r = 0.316; P = 0.716) and PH was found.
Preexisted endothelial dysfunction due to structural cardiac disease enhances the vasoactive substances release causing increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Thalidomide possibly causes a vasodilator and vasoconstriction imbalance, which may cause abnormal pulmonary vascular response interfering to a vicious circle perpetuating PH.
Pregnant rats were treated with 30 mg/kg per day cocaine or normal saline either throughout gestation (GD 1-20, cocaine and saline withdrawal) or throughout the gestation and continuing into lactation for 10 days postpartum (cocaine and saline nonwithdrawal). All cocaine-treated dams exhibited more disruptions in the onset of maternal behavior (retrieval, licking, crouching) and were more aggressive (threats and attacks) towards an intruder on postpartum day 6 than saline-treated dams. There were no significant differences in these behaviors between withdrawn and nonwithdrawn cocaine-treated dams. These findings indicate that changes in maternal behavior following chronic moderate cocaine treatment are not simply the result of withdrawal from cocaine treatment following gestation and that other possible mechanisms should be examined.
The effect of urinary bladder inflammation on the activity of a bladder-derived relaxant factor in the coaxial bioassay system was examined. Bladder inflammation was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) cyclophosphamide or intravesical lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to male rats. In precontracted rat anococcygeus muscle that was placed within rat bladder (coaxial bioassay system), acetylcholine induced a relaxation response, which was not altered by the denudation of urothelium or incubation with indomethacin and N(G)-methyl-L-arginine. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was significantly attenuated, when bladders were removed from cyclophosphamide- and LPS-pretreated group of rats and were used with intact urothelium in the coaxial bioassay system. However, the impairment acetylcholine response in both pretreatment groups was not observed after denudation of the bladder urothelium. These results showed that bladder inflammation did not alter the synthesis and/or release of this bladder-derived relaxant factor, which is neither a cyclooxygenase product nor nitric oxide, but restricted its demonstration by coaxial bioassay assembly probably due to inflammation-induced mucosal oedema.
Tardive dyskinesia is a serious neurological syndrome associate with long-term administration of neuroleptics to humans and experimental animals. It may be caused by loss of dopaminergic cells, due to free radicals as a product of high synaptic dopamine levels. Quercetin is a bioflavonoid with strong antioxidant properties.
To evaluate the effect of chronic quercetin treatment on haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia.
Vacuous chewing movements (VCM) in rats, a widely accepted animal model of tardive dyskinesia was employed in the present study. VCM were induced in rats by daily administration of haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg) for a period of 21 days. Animals with established dyskinesia were given quercetin for a period of 4 weeks and behavioral scoring was recorded every week before administration of quercetin. Animals were killed after the last behavioral recordings and biochemical estimations were carried out.
Chronic haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg for 21 days) treatment significantly induced VCM and tongue protrusions in rats and quercetin (25-100 mg/kg for 4 weeks) significantly reversed haloperidol-induced VCM and tongue protrusions. Biochemical analysis revealed that chronic haloperidol treatment significantly induced lipid peroxidation, decreased glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase levels in the brains of rats. Quercetin (25-100 mg/kg for 4 weeks) significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and restored GSH, SOD and catalase levels.
The results of the present study clearly indicate that quercetin has a protective role against haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia. Consequently, the use of quercetin as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia should be considered.
To evaluate renal dysfunction in adult patients encountered during and immediately after repeated administrations of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) for treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).
In this single-center, retrospective, open label trial, 23 consecutive adult patients aged between 19 and 94 years diagnosed with PCNSL were given >or=4 consecutive cycles of HDMTX (8 gm/m(2)/dose) every 14 days as per institution protocol. Serum creatinine and serum methotrexate levels were measured at 24, 48 and 72 h after beginning of HDMTX infusion.
Forty-eight percent of all patients (30% of all HDMTX cycles) experienced a >or=200% increase in baseline creatinine during treatment. Nine percent of patients met requirements for administration of carboxypeptidase-G(2) (glucarpidase) under compassionate use from National Cancer Institute. Thirty percent of patients at the conclusion of HDMTX therapy demonstrated a NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 2 or higher increase in post-treatment serum creatinine compared to pre-treatment serum creatinine amongst whom ten patients (43%) had levels outside of the normal range.
Renal dysfunction of CTC grade 2, 3 or 4 is common during treatment with HDMTX in the treatment of PCNSL, occurring in 40% of all cycles. Renal dysfunction persists at least 4 months following the conclusion of therapy in nearly 30% of patients. Male patients age greater than 50 years are at greatest risk of renal dysfunction.
Few metabolites from fungi found indoors have been tested for inflammatory mediators endpoints in primary cultures of alveolar macrophages or in vivo. In this study, mice were intratracheally instilled with a single dose comprising 4x10(-5)moletoxin/kg lung wt dose of either atranone C, brevianamide, cladosporin, mycophenolic acid, neoechinulin A & B, sterigmatocystin or TMC-120A. These toxins are from fungi common on damp building materials. The dose used was comparable to the estimated doses of possible human exposure. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology and Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid Schiff (AB/PAS) histochemistry were used to evaluate lungs for time course (4h and 12h post-exposure (PE)) inflammatory and toxic changes. Reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR based arrays were also employed to evaluate time course inflammation-associated gene transcription in lung tissues of the different toxins. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to probe MIP-2 and Tnf-alpha protein expression in treatment lungs to determine whether responses correspond with gene transcription data. Both histology and histochemistry revealed that toxin exposed lungs at 12h PE showed evidence of inflammation. H&E revealed that bronchioli were lined with irregularly thickened and sometimes sloughing epithelium and bronchiolar spaces supported infiltration of leukocytes, cellular and mucus-like debris while alveolar spaces supported swollen macrophages and modest amorphous debris accumulations. All toxin-instilled lungs exhibited copious mucus production and alveolar macrophages with red stained cytoplasm on bronchiolar surfaces, especially at 12h PE. Array analysis of 83 inflammation-associated genes extracted from lung tissue demonstrated a number of patterns, compared to controls. 82 genes assayed at 4h PE and 75 genes at 12h PE were significantly altered (p< or =0.05; >or =1.5-fold or < or =-1.5-fold change) in the different treatment animal groups. Expression of transcriptionally regulated genes was confirmed using immunohistochemistry that demonstrated MIP-2 and Tnf-alpha staining in respiratory bronchiolar epithelia, alveolar macrophages and alveolar type II cells. The transcriptional regulation in these genes in the treatment groups suggests that they may serve central roles in the immunomodulation of toxin-induced pro-inflammatory lung responses. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed significant patterns of gene transcription linking the response of the toxins at equimolar doses in three groups: (1) brevianamide, mycophenolic acid and neoechinulin B, (2) neoechinulin A and sterigmatocystin, and (3) cladosporin, atranone C and TMC-120. The results further confirm the inflammatory nature of metabolites/toxins from such fungi can contribute to the development of non-allergenic respiratory health effects.
Axonal damage and loss of neurons correlate with permanent vision loss and neurologic disability in patients with optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis (MS). Current therapies involve immunomodulation, with limited effects on neuronal damage. The authors examined potential neuroprotective effects in optic neuritis by SRT647 and SRT501, two structurally and mechanistically distinct activators of SIRT1, an enzyme involved in cellular stress resistance and survival.
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, was induced by immunization with proteolipid protein peptide in SJL/J mice. Optic neuritis developed in two thirds of eyes with significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss detected 14 days after immunization. RGCs were labeled in a retrograde fashion with fluorogold by injection into superior colliculi. Optic neuritis was detected by inflammatory cell infiltration of the optic nerve.
Intravitreal injection of SIRT1 activators 0, 3, 7, and 11 days after immunization significantly attenuated RGC loss in a dose-dependent manner. This neuroprotective effect was blocked by sirtinol, a SIRT1 inhibitor. Treatment with either SIRT1 activator did not prevent EAE or optic nerve inflammation. A single dose of SRT501 on day 11 was sufficient to limit RGC loss and to preserve axon function.
SIRT1 activators provide an important potential therapy to prevent the neuronal damage that leads to permanent neurologic disability in optic neuritis and MS patients. Intravitreal administration of SIRT1 activators does not suppress inflammation in this model, suggesting that their neuroprotective effects will be additive or synergistic with current immunomodulatory therapies.
We conducted this retrospective study to determine the endometrial pathologic findings at the time of dilatation and curettage in breast cancer patients on tamoxifen and compare these findings with those from a similar group of patients not receiving tamoxifen.
The pathologic findings from endometrial curettings in all breast cancer patients who underwent a dilatation and curettage between January 1986 and June 1993 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Medical records and office charts were reviewed to determine the patient age, history, and duration of tamoxifen use, and the presence of symptoms (vaginal spotting or bleeding).
Two hundred and forty breast cancer patients were identified. Seventy-five patients (31%) were taking tamoxifen (mean duration, 26 months) at the time of dilatation and curettage. Fifty-three of these patients were symptomatic. Twenty-two of the patients taking tamoxifen were asymptomatic. One hundred and sixty-five patients (69%) were not taking tamoxifen. Of these patients, 109 were symptomatic and 56 were asymptomatic. In both symptomatic and asymptomatic breast cancer patients, there was no difference in the incidence of endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, or adenocarcinoma when comparing tamoxifen users with nonusers.
Short-term tamoxifen use in breast cancer patients was not found to alter the endometrial pathologic findings at the time of dilatation and curettage.
Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model.
Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model.
Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro.
Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.
p,p'-DDT (100 to 600 mg per kilogram orally) produced spontaneous and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus in mice and rats. Drugs that enhance brain serotonergic activity reduced p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus, and serotonin antagonists invariably aggravated this syndrome. p,p'-DDT-treated rats had increased concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in seven regional areas, but serotonin was increased only in the midbrain and cerebellum. We postulate that p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus may be causally related to blockage of serotonin receptors or inhibition of serotonin release into the synapse, resulting in functional deficiency of this neurotransmiter at the receptor site.
To investigate the local effects of angiotensin II on the heart, we created a mouse model with 100-fold normal cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), but no ACE expression in kidney or vascular endothelium. This was achieved by placing the endogenous ACE gene under the control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter using targeted homologous recombination. These mice, called ACE 8/8, have cardiac angiotensin II levels that are 4.3-fold those of wild-type mice. Despite near normal blood pressure and a normal renal function, ACE 8/8 mice have a high incidence of sudden death. Both histological analysis and in vivo catheterization of the heart showed normal ventricular size and function. In contrast, both the left and right atria were three times normal size. ECG analysis showed atrial fibrillation and cardiac block. In conclusion, increased local production of angiotensin II in the heart is not sufficient to induce ventricular hypertrophy or fibrosis. Instead, it leads to atrial morphological changes, cardiac arrhythmia, and sudden death.
Although many immunoglobulin-related drug sensitivities have been described, there is a paucity of reports regarding IgE-related drug sensitivities. Here we describe a case of a patient who demonstrated IgE-mediated sensitivity to ibuprofen.
We describe three patients in whom severe, life-threatening hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency developed after treatment of acute gouty arthritis with indomethacin. This complication may result from an inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and consequent hyporeninemic hypoaidosteronism. Careful attention to renal function and potassium balance in patients receiving indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, particularly in those patients with diabetes mellitus or preexisting renal disease, will help prevent this potentially serious complication.
This study assessed the risk of haematological, renal and hepatic toxicity associated with amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC; Abelcet) in a multicentre, open-label, non-comparative study of 93 patients from 17 different hospitals who received ABLC because of proven or suspected systemic fungal infection or leishmaniasis. Most (66%) patients had onco-haematological diseases. Optimum treatment with ABLC comprised a slow (2-h) infusion dose of 5 mg/kg/day for a minimum period of 14 days. Biochemical and haematological parameters were measured pre-, during and post-treatment. In the overall patient group, the mean serum creatinine concentration was similar pre- and post-study (1.00 +/- 1.14 mg/dL vs. 1.20 +/- 1.19 mg/dL; p > 0.05). There were no significant changes pre- and post-treatment in concentrations of haemoglobin, potassium, transaminases and bilirubin. There was no significant correlation between the dose administered and the concentrations of serum creatinine (Spearmann 0.22). There was no greater nephrotoxicity in the patients with previous renal failure, or in those who had received amphotericin B previously. There were serious adverse events in five patients, but other alternative causes that could explain these events were present in three of these patients. Fevers or chills were experienced by 23% of the patients during the ABLC infusion, but only in one case did this necessitate the suspension of treatment. It was concluded that ABLC is a drug with low nephrotoxicity, even when administered to patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency. Adverse events were generally slight or moderate, and were managed easily with appropriate pre-medication.
The study aimed to assess the effects of topical antacids for treatment of capsaicin-induced dermal pain after exposure to capsaicin containing hot peppers, personal protection sprays, or topical creams.
Participants of the study were California Poison Control System (CPCS) hotline callers 12 years or older with dermal pain from exposure to capsaicin-containing products or plants. Participants were instructed to apply a topical antacid and assessed for perceived pain (using a 0-10 scale) pre- and posttreatment. A positive response was defined as a sustained reduction of pain 33% or more within 30 minutes or achieving a pain score of 0 to 1.
Of 93 eligible patients, 64 applied antacids and had outcome data available. Patients contacted the CPCS a median of 1 hour postexposure with a median initial pain score of 7.5/10. Thirty-six (56%) were exposed to unrefined (natural) peppers and 28 (44%) to refined capsaicin (eg, capsaicin-containing cream). Before calling the CPCS, 57 (89%) attempted at least one treatment. Forty-five (70%) reported positive response to antacid treatment as a 33% reduction in pain in 30 minutes (n = 17), a reduction in pain to a score of 0 to 1 (n = 3), or both (n = 25). A 33% reduction in pain within 30 minutes was associated with exposure to refined capsaicin (odds ratio, 3.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-11.66). Concomitant refined capsaicin exposure and early treatment (<1 hour of symptoms) was associated with even greater odds of response (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-21.2).
Topical application of antacids for capsaicin-induced pain is effective, particularly in early treatment of exposure to refined capsaicin.
Thyroid hormones were determined in rat serum, thyroid, liver and kidney tissues; the animals were fed for 40 days an equilibrate diet and various amounts of lithium carbonate were added to drinks. Serum lithium levels were related to their absorption. There was no change in rats drinking 300 mg Li2CO3/l solution for 5 weeks or 600 mg/l for 2 weeks, when compared to control rats. But 600 mg/l solutions for 5 weeks led to hormone increase in thyroid tissue. With 1200 mg/l acute hormonal decrease was seen in serum (thyroxine, T4: 3.2 micrograms/dl and control: 4, triiodothyronine T3: 54.8 ng/dl and control: 64) in liver tissue T3: 2.6 ng/g and control: 3.5), and in kidney tissue (T3: 4.8 ng/g and control: 6.4). In some animals receiving 600 or 1200 mg, lithium concentration was very high, body weights were very much reduced and there was large hormonal decrease in serum (T4: 1.4 micrograms/dl, T3: 48.5 ng/dl) in liver tissue (T4: 10.5 ng/g and control: 20.7; T3: 2.1 ng/g) and in kidney tissue (T4: 6.9 ng/g and control: 13.5 and T3: 3.3 ng/g). Hormonal changes were parallel to tubular kidney damage. These results are similar to those described in patients receiving lithium treatment.
Combination therapy with catheter ablation of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus and continued drug therapy, that is, "hybrid therapy," in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and drug-induced atrial flutter (AFL) is reported to be an alternative means of achieving and maintaining sinus rhythm. With respect to choosing this method among the rhythm control therapies, its long-term efficacy and the prevalence of AFL in patients with AF are very important and have not been fully elucidated.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term effectiveness of this hybrid therapy and the dose prevalence in Ic drug-induced AFL.
The subjects were 89 patients (aged 62.4 years, 72 men) with episodes of AF (paroxysmal type: 65, persistent type: 11, permanent type: 13). After 4 weeks of oral pilsicainide administration, the dose was increased in those with no documented AFL. The patients who experienced AFL with pilsicainide (Ic-AFL) underwent ablation.
Pilsicainide administration resulted in the common type AFL in 17 patients (19.1%). The pilsicainide plasma concentration in the patients with Ic-AFL was significantly higher than in those without AFL (0.79 +/- 0.41 vs. 0.51 +/- 0.24 microg/ml, respectively, p < 0.01). During a 10-54 (mean 37 +/- 14) month follow-up period, sinus rhythm was maintained in 10 of 12 patients after successful ablation followed by continued antiarrhythmic drug administration.
Hybrid therapy with ablation and high doses of pilsicainide was useful in maintaining sinus rhythm in some selected patients with AF and drug-induced AFL.
