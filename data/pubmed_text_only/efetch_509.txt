Lercanidipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, are established antihypertensive agents. A fixed-dose tablet formulation of lercanidipine/enalapril is approved in Germany for the treatment of hypertension in patients not responding to monotherapy. Lercanidipine/enalapril 10mg/10mg once daily significantly reduced sitting diastolic blood pressure and sitting systolic blood pressure, relative to lercanidipine 10mg once daily, in a 12-week, randomised, double-blind trial in patients with mild to moderate hypertension who had previously not responded to 4 weeks' treatment with lercanidipine. In a similarly designed trial, lercanidipine/enalapril 10mg/20mg once daily was significantly more effective than enalapril 20mg once daily in hypertensive patients who had previously not responded to enalapril monotherapy. Fixed-dose lercanidipine/enalapril was generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile similar to that of either of the individual drugs alone or placebo. Cough was reported in <or=5.2% and peripheral oedema in <or=1.5% of lercanidipine/enalapril recipients.
In the present study we analyzed aquaporin-4 (AQP4) immunoreactivity in the piriform cortex (PC) and the hippocampus of pilocarpine-induced rat epilepsy model to elucidate the roles of AQP4 in brain edema following status epilepticus (SE). In non-SE-induced animals, AQP4 immunoreactivity was diffusely detected in the PC and the hippocampus. AQP4 immunoreactivity was mainly observed in the endfeet of astrocytes. Following SE the AQP4-deleted area was clearly detected in the PC, not in the hippocampus. Decreases in dystrophin and α-syntrophin immunoreactivities were followed by reduction in AQP4 immunoreactivity. These alterations were accompanied by the development of vasogenic edema and the astroglial loss in the PC. In addition, acetazolamide (an AQP4 inhibitor) treatment exacerbated vasogenic edema and astroglial loss both in the PC and in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that SE may induce impairments of astroglial AQP4 functions via disruption of the dystrophin/α-syntrophin complex that worsen vasogenic edema. Subsequently, vasogenic edema results in extensive astroglial loss that may aggravate vasogenic edema.
Lithium is used for several decades to treat manic-depressive illness (bipolar affective disorder). Recently, it was found that lithium induces autophagy, thereby promoting the clearance of mutant huntingtin and alpha-synucleins in experimental systems. We show here for the first time that lithium significantly reduces the amount of pathological prion protein (PrP(Sc)) in prion-infected neuronal and non-neuronal cultured cells by inducing autophagy. Treatment of prion-infected cells with 3-methyladenine, a potent inhibitor of autophagy, counteracted the anti-prion effect of lithium, demonstrating that induction of autophagy mediates degradation of PrP(Sc). Co-treatment with lithium and rapamycin, a drug widely used to induce autophagy, had an additive effect on PrP(Sc) clearance compared to treatment with either drug alone. In addition, we provide evidence that the ability to reduce PrP(Sc) and to induce autophagy is common for diverse lithium compounds, not only for the drug lithium chloride, usually administered in clinical therapy. Furthermore, we show here that besides reduction of PrP(Sc)-aggregates, lithium-induced autophagy also slightly reduces the levels of cellular prion protein. Limiting the substrate available for conversion of cellular prion protein into PrP(Sc) may provide an additional mechanism for reduction of PrP(Sc) by lithium-induced autophagy.
Recent data from a national survey highlighted a significant difference in obesity rates in young fragile X males (31%) compared to age matched controls (18%). Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of intellectual disability in males and the most common single gene cause of autism. This X-linked disorder is caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide CGG repeat (>200) on the promotor region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1). As a result, the promotor region often becomes methylated which leads to a deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). Common characteristics of FXS include mild to severe cognitive impairments in males but less severe cognitive impairment in females. Physical features of FXS include an elongated face, prominent ears, and post-pubertal macroorchidism. Severe obesity in full mutation males is often associated with the Prader-Willi phenotype (PWP) which includes hyperphagia, lack of satiation after meals, and hypogonadism or delayed puberty; however, there is no deletion at 15q11-q13 nor uniparental maternal disomy. Herein, we discuss the molecular mechanisms leading to FXS and the Prader-Willi phenotype with an emphasis on mouse FMR1 knockout studies that have shown the reversal of weight increase through mGluR antagonists. Finally, we review the current medications used in treatment of FXS including the atypical antipsychotics that can lead to weight gain and the research regarding the use of targeted treatments in FXS that will hopefully have a significantly beneficial effect on cognition and behavior without weight gain.
To assess school-age cognitive and achievement outcomes in children with prenatal cocaine exposure, controlling for confounding drug and environmental factors.
At age 9 years, 371 children (192 cocaine exposure [CE]; 179 non-cocaine exposure [NCE]) were assessed for IQ and school achievement in a longitudinal, prospective study from birth. An extensive number of confounding variables were controlled, including quality of caregiving environment, polydrug exposure, blood lead level, iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), and foster/adoptive care.
Prenatal cocaine exposure predicted poorer perceptual reasoning IQ, with a linear relationship of the concentration of the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine to the degree of impairment. Effects were mediated through birth head circumference, indicating a relationship with fetal brain growth. Negative effects of alcohol, lead, and marijuana exposure and positive effects of the home environment were additive. The CE children in foster/adoptive care had better home environments and lower lead levels. School achievement was not affected.
Persistent teratologic effects of CE on specific cognitive functions and additive effects of alcohol, lead, and marijuana exposure; IDA; and the home environment were identified. Documenting environmental factors in behavioral teratology studies is important, because in this sample, CE was associated with better home environment and lower environmental risk in a substantial number of children.
Affective (mood) disorders are common in all ages often chronic or recurrent, destructive of personal and social functioning with significant morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis still rests on the clinical skills of interview, observation and a knowledge of the disorders. Lithium is simple, cheap and effective although underused. It is the main pharmacological agent currently used in bipolar disorders and as an adjunct in other affective disorders. While it does have a narrow therapeutic window and can cause serious morbidity itself, it is safe when delivered properly reducing both morbidity and mortality. Lithium therapy should only be started in a specialist psychiatric setting but other clinicians will be involved either in maintenance treatment or in treating patients for separate disorders who happen also to be on lithium.
Sustained over-expression of Aurora A (AurA), centrosome amplification, chromosomal instability, and aneuploidy are salient features that occur in high frequency in human breast premalignant stages and in primary ductal breast cancer (BC), as well as in 17beta-estradiol (E2)-induced oncogenesis in animal models. We have reported that AurA/B protein expression increases 8.7- and 4.6-fold, respectively, in primary E2-induced male Syrian hamster uterine stem cell-like tumors of the kidney (EUTK) when compared with cholesterol-treated control kidneys. Upon a 10-day E2-withdrawal or coadministration of tamoxifen citrate, a 78-79% and 81-64% reduction in AurA/B protein expression, respectively, were observed in primary tumors when compared with tumors from animals continuously exposed to E2. These data indicate that AurA/B expression is regulated by estrogens via estrogen receptor alpha. To determine whether this E2-induced over-expression of the Aur kinases may contribute to the alterations observed during oncogenesis via their phosphorylation of specific substrates, we analyzed the protein expression of histone H3 and targeting protein for Xklp2 (TPX2). Histone H3 and TPX2 were significantly over-expressed 3.7- and 1.6-fold, respectively, in E2-induced tumors when compared with cholesterol-treated control kidney samples. Immunohistochemistry revealed that TPX2 protein expression was essentially confined to tumor foci cells. Collectively, these data indicate that over-expression of AurA/B is under estrogen control and that the deregulation of Aur kinase protein substrates is implicated in eliciting the alterations observed during oncogenesis.
The incidence of follicular lymphoma (FL) in industrialized countries has been increasing since the 1950s. Polymorphisms in genes encoding key enzymes controlling folate-methionine metabolism, including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MS or MTR), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), and thymidylate synthase (TS or TYMS), modify the risk of various cancers and possibly FL. This study specifically looks for an association between MTHFR, MTR, TYMS, and SHMT polymorphisms and the risk of FL. We carried out a case-control study with 172 patients diagnosed with FL and 206 control subjects. We report that the risk of FL was doubled by the association of one mutant allele at both MTHFR polymorphisms. Individuals with MTR 2756AA had 2-fold higher risk of FL, and subjects not having at least one TYMS 2R allele showed a 2-fold higher risk of FL. The MTR 2756AA genotype conferred a greater multivariate-adjusted relative risk of FL, and the risk was multiplied by almost 5 in the TYMS2R(-)/MTR 2756AA combination. In conclusion, common polymorphisms in key enzymes of the folate-methionine metabolism pathway result in an increased risk of FL and suggest that inadequate intake of dietary folate and other methyl donor nutrients may contribute to the development of this malignancy.
We present a case report of a woman for whom a topical mucosal ulcer drug was prescribed and the pharmacist erroneously dispensed a calcium channel blocker (CCB), resulting in toxicities from the drug and withdrawal symptoms when attempts were made to stop the CCB. The pharmacology and toxicology of CCBs are discussed, particularly in relation to the adverse experiences of the case.
Early full-term pregnancy reduces the risk of mammary cancer in humans. Rats and mice also exhibit this phenomenon of parity protection. Short-term treatment with pregnancy levels of estradiol (E2) is also highly effective in preventing mammary carcinogenesis. Earlier it has been demonstrated that parous rats treated with carcinogen develop latent microscopic mammary tumors that do not progress further to form overt mammary cancers. In the current investigation, we wanted to find out if short-term treatment with pregnancy levels of E2 also prevents mammary carcinogenesis similar to parity. Rats were injected with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea at 7 weeks of age and treated with 20 microg, 100 microg, 200 microg, or 30mg of E2 in silastic capsules for 3 weeks. 100 microg (17%), 200 microg (17%), and 30mg (17%) doses of E2 resulted in levels of E2 equivalent to pregnancy level and were effective in preventing overt mammary cancer incidence compared with control (100%) or 20 microg (73%) E2 treatment, which did not result in pregnancy levels of E2 in the circulation. Although a significant reduction of overt cancers was observed in the pregnancy levels of E2 treated groups, there was no difference in the incidence of latent microscopic mammary cancers between the E2 treated and the controls. Proliferation of latent microscopic mammary cancers was examined using immunohistochemistry for cyclin D1 expression. Proliferation in the latent microscopic mammary cancers of the protected groups was significantly lower (approximately 2.0-3.0-fold) than the latent microscopic mammary cancers in the unprotected groups. These findings indicate that mammary cancer development can be blocked by inhibiting or blocking promotion and progression of carcinogen initiated cells.
A 29-year-old man admitted to a psychiatric unit was successfully treated for a paranoid psychosis with trifluoperazine. Following reduction of neuroleptic dosage and addition of paroxetine he developed severe extra-pyramidal side effects. These remitted after withdrawal of medication and did not recur following recommencement of trifluoperazine. This is the first report of such a side effect associated with paroxetine use in man.
Although DSM-IV criteria are widely used in making diagnoses of substance use disorders, gaps exist regarding diagnosis classification, use of dependence criteria, and effects of measurement bias on diagnosis assessment. We examined the construct and measurement equivalence of diagnostic criteria for cocaine and opioid dependences, including whether each criterion maps onto the dependence construct, how well each criterion performs, how much information each contributes to a diagnosis, and whether symptom-endorsing is equivalent between demographic groups.
Item response theory (IRT) and multiple indicators-multiple causes (MIMIC) modeling were performed on a sample of stimulant-using methadone maintenance patients enrolled in a multisite study of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) (N=383). Participants were recruited from six community-based methadone maintenance treatment programs associated with the CTN and major U.S. providers. Cocaine and opioid dependences were assessed by DSM-IV Checklist.
IRT modeling showed that symptoms of cocaine and opioid dependences, respectively, were arrayed along a continuum of severity. All symptoms had moderate to high discrimination in distinguishing drug users between severity levels. "Withdrawal" identified the most severe symptom of the cocaine dependence continuum. MIMIC modeling revealed some support for measurement equivalence.
Study results suggest that self-reported symptoms of cocaine and opioid dependences and their underlying constructs can be measured appropriately among treatment-seeking polysubstance users.
The investigation of the gastric mucigenous function in dynamics in the treatment by antisecretory medications was carried out in 120 patients with peptic ulcer disease. The selective Mi-cholinolytic gastrocepine, H2-blockers--Ranitidin and Famotidin, the proton pump inhibitor--Omeprasol, were used in the complex therapy. The mucigenous stomach function was investigated by the biochemical method at the level of sialic acids fractions, glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans and proteins. It was shown that at the exacerbation of the ulcerative disease the expressed changes in gastric mucus were observed. It was shown, that Mi-cholinolytic gastrocepine has the most effective recovering activity on the gastric mucigenous function. The obtained results expand the possibilities of differential use of antisecretory preparations in ulcerative disease in connection with the gastric mucigenous function and acidity disorders.
Spontaneous resolution of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) without liver transplantation or improvement in the underlying liver disease has rarely been reported in the literature. Increased endogenous production of nitric oxide has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HPS. We report the case of a 50-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis who demonstrated dramatic improvement in HPS after withdrawal from chronic methadone therapy. We speculate on the potential role of opiate receptors in the pulmonary vasculature and their effect on nitric oxide signaling as a potential mechanism accounting for the patient's clinical improvement.
A double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study was undertaken in order to assess the antihypertensive efficacy of a fixed combination of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide in two different dosages by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). After a three-week placebo wash-out period, 18 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, all males, aged 41-60 years, were randomized to receive benazepril 5 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg, benazepril 10 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or placebo, all given once daily for 4 weeks, according to a 3 crossover period, arranged in a 3 x 3 latin square design. Patients were checked after the wash-out period and every 4 weeks thereafter. At each visit, 24-hour ABPM was performed by a non-invasive device (Spacelabs 90202); causal BP (by mercury sphygmomanometer) and HR were also measured. Both dosages of the fixed combination were equally effective in reducing systolic and diastolic BP values throughout the 24-hour period as compared to the placebo. The antihypertensive effect of the drug could be observed to a similar extent both during the day and night and was still significant 24-hour post-dosing. In addition, the fixed combination did not affect the normal BP circadian variability.
The genus Xiphophorus is an important vertebrate model for investigating the etiology and genetics of both spontaneous and induced cancers. Xiphophorus are comprised of 23 species most of which can be crossed to produce fertile interspecies hybrid progeny. The Xiphophorus gene map is well developed and allows genetic associations to be studied among cohorts of progeny derived from backcrossing interspecies hybrid animals to one of the parental strains. In interspecies cross-progeny from select Xiphophorus backcrosses, ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light (UVB), and exposure to methylnitrosourea (MNU) have all been shown to induce tumors. Induced tumor types represented in various models include melanoma, fibrosarcoma, schwannoma, retinoblastoma, etc. The well-established backcross hybrid genetics make Xiphophorus fish an excellent system to study the contribution of DNA repair capability to induced tumorigenesis. DNA repair pathways represent multigenic traits that must be tightly regulated to insure genome fidelity. Herein we review initial DNA repair studies that assess repair capacities among different Xiphophorus species and interspecies hybrids. Assessment of both base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) have yielded consistent results indicating reduced DNA repair function in hybrid fish tissues. These data provide molecular support for potential reduced fitness in hybrid fish under conditions of environmental stress and may present a plausible explanation for absence of interspecies hybridization in sympatric environments. In addition, they support the role of direct DNA damage and its repair in the initiation of tumors in Xiphophorus hybrids.
Two patients had transient deterioration of renal function during acute infectious states while receiving indomethacin. Neither patient was in septic shock; renal function deteriorated at a time when clinically the infection was improving and both patients improved when indomethacin was discontinued, with return of renal function to baseline. Indomethacin inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and has been shown to reduce glomerular filtration and alter renal hemodynamic autoregulation. In susceptible patients these effects may be clinically significant. Careful monitoring of renal function in such patients requiring indomethacin therapy is warranted.
Immune complex-induced vascular damage can be markedly suppressed by treatment of rats with either prostaglandin (PG)E1 or its stable derivative, 15-(S)-15-methyl PGE1, but not with PGF2 alpha. In addition, PGD2 and PGE2 also show suppressive effects. The PGE1 derivative is considerably more effective than PGE1 and shows potent anti-inflammatory activity even after oral administration. Suppression of the vasculitis reaction is reflected by a greatly diminished increase in vasopermeability, indicating little or no vascular damage. In suppressed animals, the infiltration of neutrophils is greatly reduced, and those leukocytes that have appeared at tissue sites fail to show phagocytic uptake of immune complexes. In suppressed animals, the skin sites nevertheless show deposits of immune complexes and C3 fixation in vascular walls. Neutrophils harvested from the blood of rats treated with PGE1 show depressed responsiveness in chemotaxis and in enzyme secretion after incubation with chemotactic peptide. These studies indicate that certain PG have potent anti-inflammatory activity, which may be related to their effects on leukocytes.
Environmental lighting conditions affect circadian rhythm and carcinogenesis. The effect of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, i.p., 200 mg/kg) on carcinogenesis and circadian rhythmicity under a light-dark (LD) cycle, constant dark (DD) and constant light (LL) was analyzed in rats. After the recognition of entrainment in locomotor activity rhythm to LD cycle, animals remained under the LD cycle or were released into DD or LL. Liver carcinogenicity, measured by GST-P immunostaining, was higher under the LD cycle than under DD and LL. Two weeks after DEN injection, locomotor activity in 24 hr had increased under the LD. Circadian rhythmicity might be coupled with the carcinogenicity of DEN.
It is possible to perform acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) in combination with controlled hypotension (CH). In this randomized prospective study, we examined the effect of the combination of ANH and CH on cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy.
Fifty-six patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery were randomly assigned to either group A (ANH only) or group CH (CH in combination with ANH). In group CH, CH was induced with esmolol. The regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) was monitored continuously and was compared between the two groups before and after ANH, 30 min (OP(30)) and 90 min (OP(90)) after the beginning of surgery and after the completion of surgery.
The value of rSO(2) was the same in both groups in the absence of CH (at baseline: group A, 70.1 +/- 6.0%; group CH, 69.9 +/- 6.7%; after surgery: group A, 64.5 +/- 4.9%; group CH, 64.3 +/- 5.8%). However, in the presence of CH, rSO(2) values were significantly lower in group CH than in group A (at OP(30): group A: 60.4 +/- 3.4%; group CH, 55.9 +/- 7.3%; P < 0.01; at OP(90): group A, 58.3 +/- 5.2%; group CH, 53.5 +/- 6.5%; P < 0.001). The number of patients with rSO(2) < 50% was significantly higher in group CH (14.3%) than in group A (3.8%).
ANH in combination with esmolol-induced CH causes a significant decrease in cerebral oxygen saturation compared with ANH alone.
Fentanyl, a synthetic analgesic narcotic, was used in 2,000 cases of pediatric facial trauma between 1981 and 1984. A dose of 2 to 3 micrograms per kilogram of body weight was administered slowly intravenously to provide sedation and analgesia to facilitate the repair. The drug has advantages ideal for outpatient use, namely rapid onset, brief duration, and short recovery time. The major possible complication is that of apnea, which requires that resuscitation equipment be available. Three apneic episodes occurred in this series and all were successfully reversed with naloxone with no untoward effects.
Mounting evidence suggests that catechol metabolites of estradiol may contribute to the development of estrogen-induced cancers. O-Methylation, catalyzed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), inactivates catechol estrogens. COMT is polymorphic in the human population, with 25% of Caucasians being homozygous for a low activity allele of the enzyme (COMT(LL)). We hypothesized that low activity COMT may be a risk factor for human breast cancer and designed a PCR-based RFLP assay to determine COMT genotype in a cohort of 112 matched, nested case-control samples. In the total study population, the odds ratios for the association of breast cancer risk with COMT(HL) and COMT(LL) genotypes were 1.30 [confidence interval (CI), 0.66-2.58] and 1.45 (CI, 0.69-3.07), respectively. Postmenopausal COMT(LL) women had a greater than 2-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer [odds ratio (OR), 2.18; CI, 0.93-5.11]. The association of COMT(LL) with the development of postmenopausal breast cancer was stronger and statistically significant in those women with a body mass index >24.47 kg/m2 (OR, 3.58; CI, 1.07-11.98). When COMT(LL) was combined with either glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 null or with GSTP1 Ile-105-Val/Val-105-Val (intermediate/low activity, respectively) genotypes, the risk for developing postmenopausal breast cancer was also significantly increased. Our findings suggest that the allele encoding low activity COMT may be an important contributor to the postmenopausal development of breast cancer in certain women.
