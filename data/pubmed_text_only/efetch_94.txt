Repeated exposure to cocaine results in motor sensitization that, in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), is associated to enhanced glutamate release, which in turn leads to enhanced calcium levels in dopaminergic neurons. Calcium influx activates calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases such as CaMKII. D-Serine could participate on these effects, and the objective was to discern the role of VTA D-serine after a sensitizing regimen of cocaine (10 mg/kg daily), and to discern consequent expression changes in CaMKII and its activated form. For this purpose, D-serine, sodium benzoate (inhibitor of D-amino acid oxidase, the degradating enzyme of D-serine), and 7-chlorokynurenate (inhibitor of the glycine site of NMDA receptors) were injected into the VTA (in either the induction or expression phase of sensitization), and activation state of CaMKII was assessed through blotting. The findings indicated that intra-VTA administration of D-serine (5 mM) and sodium benzoate (100 and 200 microg/microl) during the induction phase (not expression) reliably augmented the expression of behavioral sensitization to cocaine, providing evidence that D-serine in the VTA participates in the initiation of motor sensitization to this psychostimulant drug. Intra-VTA infusions of D-serine, sodium benzoate and 7-chlorokynurenate did not elicit a motor effect of their own. Confirming the important role of NMDA receptors and their activation at the glycine site, the employment of 7-chlorokynurenate (2 and 5 microg/microl) led to blocking of the development of sensitization to cocaine. CaMKII within the VTA was found to participate in D-serine's effects because this kinase, that is activated after repeated cocaine, was further activated after co-treatment with D-serine or sodium benzoate. Besides CaMKII activity was otherwise reduced by 7-chlorokynurenate.
We examined the sensitivity of metallothionein (MT)-III null mice to cadmium (Cd)-induced acute hepatotoxicity. MT-I/II null mice were also used to compare Cd toxicities between MT-III null mice and MT-I/II null mice. Male MT-I/II null mice, MT-III null mice and wild-type mice were given s.c. injection of Cd (5-20 micromol/kg) and then the blood and liver were collected from each mouse under ether anesthesia at 2 days after the administration. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities elevated by injection of Cd were significantly higher in the MT-I/II null mice than in the wild-type mice. In the MT-III null mice, ALT and AST activities were not elevated following the injection of Cd. Further, marked morphological changes such as necrosis of hepatocytes, severe hemorrhage and congestion were observed by injection of Cd in both MT-I/II null mice and wild-type mice, whereas the degree of injury was found to be more extensive in MT-I/II null mice. In contrast, only occasional damage was observed in the liver of MT-III null mice treated with the same dose of Cd. These morphological observations were consistent with the results of ALT and AST activities. In the present study, it was clearly found that MT-III null mice were resistant to Cd hepatotoxicity, although MT-I/II null mice were sensitive to its toxicity. MT-III may be an accelerative factor in Cd-induced acute hepatotoxicity.
The study has been designed to investigate the effect of BMOV, a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) inhibitor in uric acid and sodium arsenite-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED). Uric acid (150 mg kg(-)(1) day(-)(1), i.p., 3 weeks) and sodium arsenite (1.5 mg kg(-)(1) day(-)(1), i.p., 2 weeks) were administered to produce VED in rats. VED was assessed by employing isolated aortic ring preparation, electron microscopy of thoracic aorta and estimating serum concentration of nitrite/nitrate. Further, serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and aortic production of superoxide anion were estimated to assess oxidative stress. Uric acid and sodium arsenite were noted to produce VED by attenuating acetylcholine-induced endothelium dependent relaxation, impairing the integrity of vascular endothelial lining, decreasing serum nitrite/nitrate concentration and increasing serum TBARS and aortic superoxide anion generation which were significantly attenuated by BMOV (0.2 mg ml(-)(1) day(-)(1) in drinking water) or atorvastatin (30 mg kg(-)(1) day(-)(1)p.o., a standard agent). However, these ameliorative effects of BMOV have been prevented by N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (25 mg kg(-)(1) day(-)(1), i.p.), an inhibitor of NOS and glibenclamide (5 mg kg(-)(1) day(-)(1), i.p.), a blocker of ATP-sensitive K(+) channel. It may be concluded that BMOV-induced inhibition of PTPase may activate eNOS by opening of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels and consequently decrease oxidative stress to prevent uric acid and sodium arsenite-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction.
Rosiglitazone, an important peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonist, improves left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in diet-induced hypercholesterolemic rats. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of rosiglitazone on myocardial remodeling in spontaneous hypertension rats (SHRs) are unclear. Twenty male 8-week-old SHRs were randomly divided into two groups: one treated with oral saline (n=10) and the other treated with rosiglitazone (5 mgkg(-1)day(-1), n=10). Ten age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats were selected as a normal control group. Echocardiography, immunohistochemistry, real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blot analysis were performed to assess the effects of rosiglitazone. After 16 weeks of treatment, LV hypertrophy was significantly attenuated by rosiglitazone (LV weight/body weight, 2.35±0.11 vs. 2.56±0.14 mgg(-1)). According to the echocardiography results, thickening of the LV wall was reduced, and mid-wall fractional shortening was improved by rosiglitazone. Similarly, the excessive collagen deposition and upregulation of collagen I and collagen III seen in SHRs receiving saline were significantly attenuated in SHRs receiving rosiglitazone. In addition, rosiglitazone treatment increased the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and normalized the MMP-9/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 ratio. Furthermore, activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) expression were suppressed in the rosiglitazone-treated group. These results demonstrate that the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone had beneficial effects on myocardial remodeling in SHRs by way of decreasing AP-1 activation and NF-κB expression, which may help in further inhibiting transcription of the downstream genes involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial remodeling induced by hypertension.
The echinocandins provide an attractive new option for prophylactic and empirical treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients with neutropenia after intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We present two patients with hematological diseases who experienced massive intravascular hemolysis followed by renal failure after administration of micafungin. In indirect antiglobulin test, significant agglutination was observed when red blood cells were exposed to the mixture of micafungin and either of the patients' plasma samples, indicating that production of antibodies directed against both micafungin and red blood cell membrane induced hemolysis attack. Micafungin-mediated immune hemolysis represents an uncommon but life-threatening adverse reaction leading to renal failure.
Combined hyperlipidemia results from overproduction of hepatically synthesized apolipoprotein B in very low-density lipoproteins in association with reduced lipoprotein lipase activity. Thus, this condition is typically characterized by concurrent elevations in total cholesterol and triglycerides with decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. High levels of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, most prominently carried by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, are an important risk factor for coronary heart disease. Statin therapy is highly effective at lowering LDL cholesterol. Despite the benefits of statin treatment for lowering total and LDL cholesterol, many statin-treated patients still have initial or recurrent coronary heart disease events. In this regard, combined therapy with statins and fibrates is more effective in controlling atherogenic dyslipidemia in patients with combined hyperlipidemia than either drug alone. Furthermore, statins and fibrates activate PPARalpha in a synergistic manner providing a molecular rationale for combination treatment in coronary heart disease. Endothelial dysfunction associated with cardiovascular diseases may contribute to insulin resistance so that there may also be additional beneficial metabolic effects of combined statin/fibrates therapy. However, there has been little published evidence that combined therapy is synergistic or even better than monotherapy alone in clinical studies. Therefore, there is a great need to study the effects of combination therapy in patients. When statins are combined with gemfibrozil therapy, this is more likely to be accompanied by myopathy. However, this limitation is not observed when fenofibrate, bezafibrate, or ciprofibrate are used in combination therapy.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on inflammation and glomerulosclerosis in Adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, ADR nephrosis, and simvastatin-treated ADR nephrosis groups. ADR nephropathy was induced by a single-tail intravenous injection of ADR (6.5 mg/kg). Anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin were studied by evaluating the expression of the inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). In addition, renal function, serum lipid levels, and histopathology were compared between groups. Simvastatin significantly decreases IL-1beta and TGF-beta1 expression and NF-kappaB activation, accompanied by significant attenuation of glomerulosclerosis and renal function at 12 weeks after ADR injection, and these changes occurred in the absence of lowering of serum lipids. These results suggest that overexpression of inflammation in the renal region may contribute to development of glomerulosclerosis in ADR-induced-nephropathy rats, and simvastatin treatment prevented glomerulosclerosis independent of the lipid-lowering effects. The beneficial effect of simvastatin might be mediated by the effect of anti-inflammatory action through a reduction of NF-kappaB activation, and IL-1beta and TGF-beta expression.
Triphenyltin-hydroxide (TPTH) is used as agricultural fungicide in Brazil and elsewhere. This study was undertaken to evaluate the developmental toxicity of TPTH in mice. Swiss Webster mice were treated by gavage with TPTH (0, 3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg bw/day) on gestation days (GD) 6-17. Caesarean sections were performed on GD 18, and implantations, resorptions and live and dead fetuses were counted. Half of each litter was fixed and examined for visceral anomalies while the remaining fetuses were cleared and stained with Alizarin Red S for skeleton evaluation. A reduced pregnancy weight gain (after subtraction of uterine weights), smaller thymus, spleen and liver, and deaths indicated that doses > or = 7.5mg/kg body wt/day were toxic to mothers. At the two highest doses, TPTH enhanced embryolethality and reduced fetal body weight. The incidence of cleft palate (not seen in controls) was augmented (36.8%) at the highest dose of TPTH, while palatine bone defects were increased at the lowest dose (3.75 mg/kg bw/day). Soft-tissue anomalies, such as misshapened thymus, and malpositioned testes and uteri, were more frequent at doses of TPTH > or = 7.5 mg/kg bw/day. TPTH also caused a dose-related increase of fetal skeleton variations (e.g. poorly ossified skull bones) and malformations (misshapened Axis and skull bones). In conclusion, TPTH was toxic to the embryos (NOAEL <3.75 mg/kg bw/day) at doses that were not overtly toxic to their mothers.
Immediately after the introduction of the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole, a 2-year follow-up study was started to evaluate patterns of use, safety and effectiveness of this drug in naturally occurring groups of patients in the Netherlands. Medical data were recorded by participating physicians while medication listing were provided by pharmacists.
The study was designed according to the Safety Assessment of Marketed Medicines guidelines. The only inclusion criterion was the use of lansoprazole prior to entry into the study.
A total of 5669 lansoprazole users was included by 374 general practitioners and 117 specialists. Lansoprazole was mostly prescribed in patients with reflux oesophagitis (55.1%), 'gastritis' (26.8%) and duodenal ulcers (11.4%), sometimes as part of a Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy (8.5%). For their complaints most patients (91.1%) had previously used acid-related drugs. Improvement or disappearance of complaints was achieved in 88.9% and 90.5% of patients after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, respectively. Diarrhoea (4.1%), headache (2.9%) and nausea (2.6%) were the most frequently reported adverse events.
The patterns of use of lansoprazole in daily practice deviated from the recommendations in the information leaflet. Nevertheless, lansoprazole was found to be safe in this naturally occurring group of users. Effectiveness appeared to be comparable to results found in clinical trials of the registered indications for lansoprazole.
Orthostatic hypotension, one of tricyclic antidepressant treatment's side effects, is also a factor in limiting adequate antidepressant dosing. We tested in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study the effect of low doses (4 mg/t.i.d.) of yohimbine in 12 patients with depression with clomipramine-induced orthostatic hypotension. Yohimbine, a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, had a favorable effect in orthostatic hypotension and induced a significant increase in blood pressure. A pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction between yohimbine and clomipramine or demethylclomipramine was discussed.
The prevention of hepatic encephalopathy by the intravenous infusion of a branched chain amino acid (BCAA)-enriched solution was investigated in methionine and ammonium acetate-treated rats whose liver was already injured with carbon tetrachloride. A BCAA-enriched solution protected the rats from entering a coma. The brain BCAA contents became higher, and the brain methionine and tyrosine levels and the ratio of glutamine to glutamic acid in the brain diminished after administering the BCAA-enriched solution.
Ulcerative colitis is predominantly a disease of non-smokers, and transdermal nicotine is therapeutic but often results in side-effects. Administration of nicotine tartrate as a liquid enema decreases systemic nicotine absorption and may be effective for treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis. Ileocolonic delivery of nicotine tartrate via a delayed release oral capsule would be the preferred route to deliver nicotine to the colon.
To determine the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic parameters of delayed-release oral nicotine tartrate capsules (Eudragit S100 coated) at doses of 3 mg and 6 mg nicotine.
Twenty healthy human subjects received delayed-release oral nicotine tartrate at one of two doses (each group n = 10): 3 mg and 6 mg nicotine. All subjects also received intravenous nicotine tartrate (at a dose of 15 micrograms nicotine base/kg) during a separate study period. Serum nicotine concentrations were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In addition, concentrations of serum cotinine (major nicotine metabolite) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in all samples for two subjects (both given 6 mg nicotine). Adverse reactions were determined by questionnaire.
The mean bioavailabilities of nicotine after ileocolonic nicotine tartrate administration via delayed-release oral capsules at doses 3 mg and 6 mg nicotine were 41% and 42%, respectively. The ratios (after adjusting for nicotine dose) of cotinine area under the curve (AUC) for delayed-release oral nicotine to cotinine AUC for intravenous nicotine were 1.5 and 1.6 for the two subjects undergoing cotinine pharmacokinetics, demonstrating significant first-pass metabolism. Serum nicotine concentrations did not predict adverse reactions.
Nicotine tartrate delivered to the ileocolon as a delayed-release oral capsule at doses of 3 mg and 6 mg nicotine considerably reduced systemic nicotine bioavailability. This reduction in bioavailability appears to be a result of first-pass hepatic metabolism rather than poor mucosal absorption of nicotine. The therapeutic potential of an ileocolonic delivery formulation of nicotine tartrate, which can potentially limit toxicity by local delivery of high doses of nicotine, should be investigated in patients with ulcerative colitis.
Sleep and sleep-dependent learning are impaired in male cocaine users during abstinence, but for female users little is known. Cocaine dependent men (n=12) and women (n=14), and control participants (n=19) participated in this study of sleep and sleep-dependent learning. Cocaine users were assessed at 3, 10 and 20 days of abstinence and controls were studied over one night. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency and overnight motor learning were the main outcome measures. Cocaine dependent men compared to women exhibited deteriorations in sleep time, sleep efficiency, and overnight learning as abstinence progressed from 3 to 20 days. At abstinence day 3, cocaine dependent men and women were no different than control participants in the main outcomes. However, there were significant differences between cocaine men at abstinence day 20 and controls in sleep time and sleep-dependent learning, but no differences between controls and cocaine dependent women. There is growing evidence that sleep disturbances are associated with cocaine abuse and abstinence and have functional consequences that may be relevant to the development of effective treatments. The absence of sleep disturbances in women suggests a need to understand the mechanisms underlying these differences, as such knowledge could lead to novel therapies in cocaine dependence.
The number of children exposed to cocaine in utero each year is increasing. Recent reports suggest significant visual anomalies in infants prenatally exposed to cocaine. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine if children exposed prenatally to cocaine were at a greater risk for visual abnormalities, such as strabismus and significant refractive errors.
This pilot study was conducted at two sites, an outpatient clinic and a hospital-based practice. Consecutive files from January to July, 1993, of 79 children (aged 4 months to 94 months); who were identified by case history or meconium analysis information as being exposed to cocaine in utero, were reviewed. Fifty-five children met the inclusion criteria for the study. In addition, a control group of 100 pediatric patients were randomly selected from the pediatric patients seen at the outpatient clinical site.
Of the 30 children from the Illinois Eye Institute (IEI) and the 25 children from The Children's Hospital (TCH), spherical refractive errors in the right eye ranged from +6.50 to -12.50 D. The median refractive errors were +0.75 and +0.50 D, respectively. No statistical difference was found in spherical refractive error, astigmatism, or anisometropia between the cocaine-exposed cohorts and the control group (N = 100). Strabismus was found in 15/55 (27%) of the children in the cocaine-exposed group. There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of strabismus between the cocaine-exposed group and the control group. Further analysis revealed that full birthweight (> 2500 g) children prenatally exposed to cocaine were at a greater risk for strabismus as compared to the full birthweight control group. Ocular abnormalities were rare, but included optic nerve atrophy and retinopathy of prematurity.
These data suggest cocaine exposure during pregnancy may place a child at risk for conditions that may negatively impact the visual system, specifically strabismus.
Foscarnet is an antiviral agent used for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis and acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus infections in AIDS patients. Renal impairment has been reported for many patients treated with foscarnet. We have studied the effects of foscarnet on the viability (estimated by neutral red inclusion) and ultrastructure of cultures of human renal proximal tubule cells (HRPTC) isolated from the kidneys of five cadavers and cultured. The degree of foscarnet-induced toxicity was dose dependent and varied among the HRPTC cultures. The data obtained by using the in vitro system of HRPTC mimic the data of the clinical trials in that there is a dose-dependent individual variation among human cases in response to foscarnet treatment. Thus, these cultures are extremely well-suited to investigations of the mechanism of toxicity at the subcellular level.
Ursodeoxycholic acid was recently recognized as an effective agent in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. Since the beneficial effect of ursodeoxycholic acid therapy appears to be mediated in part by an immune mechanism, we evaluated the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), elevated production of which could be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Ursodeoxycholic acid (0.1-1000 microM) inhibited NO production by bacterial lipopolysaccharide-activated J774 macrophages in a concentration-dependent fashion, but the cytotoxicity was also evident at higher concentrations (250 and 1000 microM). Ursodeoxycholic acid did not have any effect on the activity of NO synthase that had already been induced. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide led to a significant expression of NO synthase mRNA that was significantly reduced by ursodeoxycholic acid. Findings indicated that ursodeoxycholic acid inhibited NO synthesis by inhibiting the induction of NO synthase, rather than its catalytic activity. Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy may exert a beneficial effect, in part, by attenuating the production of NO.
Rats reared in an enriched condition (EC) display less sensitization to nicotine than rats reared in an impoverished condition (IC). However, it is unknown what effect differential rearing has on nicotine-induced conditioned hyperactivity. The present study determined whether differential rearing affects nicotine-induced conditioned hyperactivity. This study also examined the effects of mecamylamine on conditioned hyperactivity and sensitization. EC, IC, and social condition (SC) rats were reared from 21 to 51 days of age before receiving repeated nicotine injections (.4 mg/kg) prior to 1-h locomotor sessions. Following the conditioned-hyperactivity test, rats received additional training sessions followed by a drug-free rest period before the sensitization test. Mecamylamine (1.0 mg/kg) was administered prior to the conditioned-hyperactivity test and sensitization test. Nicotine treatment resulted in sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity in all differential rearing groups. EC rats displayed less locomotor activity in response to nicotine than both IC and SC rats. Pretreatment with mecamylamine blocked the expression of conditioned hyperactivity only in EC and SC rats and attenuated sensitization in all three rearing groups. These findings suggest that environmental enrichment may alter nicotinic acetylcholine receptors during development and may be a protective factor in the initiation and relapse of smoking behavior.
Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were studied in a patient who developed visual impairment during ethambutol treatment. The ERG and the flash VEP were normal at the time of maximal visual loss, whereas pattern reversal VEPs 2 and 5 months after onset revealed evidence of severe bilateral optic nerve involvement, especially affecting macular fibres. Seven months after onset paramacular PNP complexes with a late positivity (scotomatous response) were recorded after pattern reversal and half-field stimulation, suggesting involvement of fibres subserving central vision. At the time when visual acuity was normal there was still electrophysiological evidence of a mild involvement of the anterior visual pathway. The papillomacular bundle seems to be especially involved in ethambutol eye toxicity.
Digalloylresveratrol (DIG) is a recently synthesized substance aimed to combine the effects of the natural polyphenolic compounds gallic acid and resveratrol, which both are excellent free radical scavengers with anticancer activity. In this study, we investigated the effects of DIG in the human AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. Treatment with DIG dose-dependently attenuated cells in the S phase of the cell cycle and led to a significant depletion of the dATP pool in AsPC-1 cells. The incorporation of (14)C-cytidine into nascent DNA of tumor cells was significantly inhibited at all DIG concentrations due to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, a key enzyme of DNA synthesis in tumor cells. Furthermore, Erk1/2 became inactivated and moderated p38 phosphorylation reflecting increased replication stress. DIG also activated ATM and Chk2, and induced the phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of the proto-oncogene Cdc25A, which contributed to cell cycle attenuation. Taken together, DIG is an excellent free radical scavenger, strongly inhibits RR in situ activity, cell cycle progression, and colony formation in AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells thus warranting further investigations.
Acute lung injury and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome, are characterized by an acute inflammatory response in the airspaces and lung parenchyma. The nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is expressed in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Here, we report a protective role of FXR in a lipopolysaccharide-induced mouse model of acute lung injury. Upon intratracheal injection of lipopolysaccharide, FXR-/- mice showed higher lung endothelial permeability, released more bronchoalveolar lavage cells to the alveoli, and developed acute pneumonia. Cell adhesion molecules were expressed at higher levels in FXR-/- mice as compared with control mice. Furthermore, lung regeneration was much slower in FXR-/- mice. In vitro experiments showed that FXR activation blocked TNFα-induced expression of P-selectin but stimulated proliferation of lung microvascular endothelial cells through up-regulation of Foxm1b. In addition, expression of a constitutively active FXR repressed the expression of proinflammatory genes and improved lung permeability and lung regeneration in FXR-/- mice. This study demonstrates a critical role of FXR in suppressing the inflammatory response in lung and promoting lung repair after injury.
Cardiac events in 30 patients in preterm labor on ritodrine therapy were examined continuously on a Holter monitor. Unsuspected events, such as persistent severe tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and supraventricular premature contractions, were observed. These events did not occur more frequently in patients with cardiac symptoms. None of these changes were observed by standard monitoring methods. Continued beta-mimetic stimulation in the presence of these events may lead to the serious cardiopulmonary complications that have been reported during ritodrine infusion.
A 46-year-old man began taking nicotinic acid, 3 g daily, for hypercholesterolemia. A month later, he developed clinical and biochemical evidence of modest hepatocellular injury, and therapy was stopped. It was restarted 6 weeks later, and 10 weeks after that, the patient presented with fulminant hepatic failure, which resolved rapidly after cessation of nicotinic acid therapy. We suggest that nicotinic acid was the cause of his liver disease, that this case is of particular note because of the rather short period of therapy before the onset of liver injury and the severity of the hepatic failure, and that the probable increased use of nicotinic acid for serum cholesterol control makes it especially important for physicians and their patients to be alert to the signs of hepatotoxicity.
Hamster buccal pouches were treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) triweekly for 3 wk and subsequently with 40% benzoyl peroxide (BP) in acetone for up to 27 wk. BP treatment resulted in a marked hyperplasiogenic effect and a weak tumor promoting effect. Whereas most carcinogens and tumor promoters induce gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activity, BP diminished its activity as compared to controls. Comparable results have also been noted in the liver, where a group of newly isolated hepatocarcinogens, peroxisome proliferators (PP), also characteristically deplete the GGT activity and placental glutathione S-transferase (GST-P), another tumor marker.
This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy. Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20% with treatment. The condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine (T4) or intravenous tri-iodo-thyronine (T3). Patients with CHF on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism, and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among CHF patients. The myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among CHF patients presenting with hypotension, weakness or other unexplained symptoms.
To investigate the safety (e.g., weight gain, liver function, extrapyramidal side effects, and seizures) and efficacy of the long-term use of risperidone in children and adolescents and to ascertain the effects of drug withdrawal in a semi-naturalistic prospective, subjects with autism or pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise specified (PDDNOS) were treated with risperidone for 6 months after which parents were given the option of continuing for a further 6 months (final assessment at 12 months). Behavioral rating included Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Child Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Child-Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). Risperidone significantly ameliorated behavioral symptoms of PDD in 10 out of 11 subjects, with the effects on core symptoms being of smaller amplitude and of slower onset. No loss of effectiveness was observed in patients who continued risperidone for 12 months, while a relapse of associated behavioral symptoms occurred in the others. Weight gain was common, although the rate of increase lessened over a period of time; after drug withdrawal, considerable weight loss was observed in the patient who had previously shown the most significant increase. After 6 months of therapy, two patients developed facial dystonia: this disappeared after reducing dosage in one case, after drug discontinuation in the other. Amenorrhea was also observed, but no changes in liver function, blood tests or EEG were reported. The data indicate that risperidone is an effective and relatively safe drug for long term treatment of behavioral disruption in autistic children and adolescents.
In order to elucidate the cytochemical properties of rat podocyte's membranes, the authors studied the constituents and distribution of glycocalyx and membrane cholesterol. Chromic-phosphotungstic acid (Cr-PTA) stain combined with enzyme digestive tests was used for the glycocalyx analysis. A digitonin fixation method was applied for the detection of membrane cholesterol. On the whole surface of podocytes, glycocalyx showed a strongly positive reaction to Cr-PTA. In normal rats, the reactivity on the urinary surface above the slit membrane of the podocyte foot processes was decreased after treatments with neuraminidase, hyaluronidase and heparitinase. The reactivity on the basal surface below the slit membrane disappeared only after treatment with chondroitinase ABC. In Puromycin Aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) rats, the foot processes were effaced extensively. Though a highly positive reactivity of Cr-PTA was observed on the urinary surface of the podocytes, the basal surface reacted weakly. The positive reaction of the urinary surface was not affected by the treatments with neuraminidase, hyaluronidase and heparitinase, but the weak reaction of the basal surface disappeared completely through chondroitinase ABC treatment. The distribution of membrane cholesterol was clearly revealed by the digitonin fixation method, showing digitonin cholesterol complexes of localized trilamellar structures. In normal rat podocytes the complexes were found on the urinary surface, with only a few on the basal surface. In PAN rats the complexes were seldom noticed either on the urinary or basal surfaces. The heterogeneous distribution of glycocalyx and membrane cholesterol seen in normal rat podocytes are changed remarkably under nephrotic condition.
