We observed 3 diabetic patients with intolerable dizziness followed by nausea and vomiting immediately after an initial administration of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, voglibose. These symptoms did not recur after discontinuation of the drug. Adverse effects as observed in these cases have not been reported previously. Since the 3 patients were relatively old (average age, 72 years old) and had various degrees of micro- and macroangiopathies, these side effects may have been associated with increased micro- and macrocirculatory disturbances in their central nervous systems through alpha-glucosidase inhibition of this agent.
Data on risperidone's efficacy and tolerability in adolescents with schizophrenia are scarce. We found only one prospective, open-label study in this population. The aim of this open-label, prospective study was to estimate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of risperidone treatment in adolescents with first-episode schizophrenia. Subjects were adolescent inpatients diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) first-episode schizophrenia by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present Episode version. Most of the patients (10/11) were drug na√Øve. Improvement was assessed during the first 6 weeks of treatment using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. Side effects were monitored using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, the Simpson-Angus Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, and the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effect Rating Scale. Eleven adolescents between 15.5 and 20 years of age (mean = 17.27, SD = 1.27 years) were included in this study. Risperidone in an average dose of 3.14 mg/day (SD = 1.60 mg/day) produced a significant improvement on the total PANSS score (28%, p < 0.01), BPRS score (30.11%, p < 0.01), and CGI-Severity score (31.36%, p < 0.01). Risperidone was ineffective in the treatment of negative signs as assessed by the PANSS. The major side effects were extrapyramidal side effects, somnolence, depression, and weight gain. In conclusion risperidone appears to be a safe, acceptably tolerated, and effective antipsychotic medication for the treatment of adolescent-onset schizophrenia.
Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), an aggressive malignancy of CD4+ T cells associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) infection, carries a very poor prognosis because of the resistance of leukemic cells to any conventional regimen, including chemotherapy. We examined the effect of ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, on HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells and found that it induced apoptosis and inhibited transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB in these cells. Furthermore, ritonavir inhibited expression of Bcl-xL, survivin, c-Myc, and cyclin D2, the targets of NF-kappaB. In nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID)/gammacnull (NOG) mice, ritonavir very efficiently prevented tumor growth and leukemic infiltration in various organs of NOG mice at the same dose used for treatment of patients with AIDS. Our data indicate that ritonavir has potent anti-NF-kappaB and antitumor effects and might be clinically applicable for treatment of ATL. These results would provide a new concept and novel platform for new drug development of leukemia and solid cancer as well.
We address the question whether lamivudine treatment modulates serum concentrations of hyaluronic acid and whether the pre-treatment HA level can give the information about the presumptive result of treatment and whether HA level evaluation can be useful in monitoring the antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis B.
Forty-nine patients, 31 man, aged 40 +/- 2.5 years were treated with 100 mg lamivudine per day for 48 weeks. Serum hyaluronic acid level was determined using enzyme-linked binding protein commercial assay (Corgenix Inc., USA).
The mean HA pre-treatment levels were higher than among controls (69.6 +/- 11.6 ng/ml vs 36.5 +/- 7.6 ng/ml, mean +/- SEM) and correlated with AST activity, p = 0.002; GGT activity, p = 0.006; ALP activity p < 0.001; prothrombin time, p = 0.01; and peripheral blood platelets count, p = 0.001 but did not correlated with ALT activity. The pre-treatment HA concentration correlated also with interlobular necroinflammatory activity score, p = 0.049 and with fibrosis score, p = 0.026, according to Scheuer classification. The mean HA levels decreased gradually during lamivudine treatment, up to levels lover than among controls (26.3 +/- 5.7 ng/ml). There were not significant differences in pre-treatment levels observed between patients neither with HBs seroconversion versus those without it, nor between patients with HBe seroconversion versus those without it and among patients with normalization of ALT activity versus ones without it.
Serum hyaluronic acid level decreases during lamivudine treatment both in patients with HBeAg seroconversion and without it; serum hyaluronic acid pretherapy levels correlate with necroinflammatory lobular activity score and with liver fibrosis score; serum hyaluronic acid is of no predictive value for lamivudine therapy response; serum hyaluronan may be valuable complementary marker in chronically HBV infected patients.
Forty-three anxiety disorder patients (DSM-III) who completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) and a caffeine questionnaire were compared to 124 medical inpatients. Eighty-four percent of the anxious patients were low caffeine consumers (0-249 mg/day) compared to 41% of medical inpatients; 65% of anxiety patients consumed less than 100 mg/day. In anxiety patients, there were no significant correlations between subscale scores of the SCL-90-R and amount of caffeine consumption. Patients who consumed less than 100 mg/day did not differ on anxiety subscale scores of the SCL-90-R from those who consumed more. However, patients who reported becoming anxious in response to drinking coffee had higher SCL-90-R anxiety subscale scores than patients who did not, even though their daily consumption was not different. It appears that anxiety disorder patients have increased caffeine sensitivity which leads to decreased consumption.
The following issues in post-resuscitative cerebral oedema and hypotension were discussed: (1) the concept and importance of secondary cerebral oedema; (2) 'hypovolaemic' hypotension and cerebral oedema, aetiology, contradiction and treatment; (3) fluid intake control and dehydration effect; and (4) diuresis and mannitol-nephrosis. Although there is still no evidence to show that dehydration therapy directly plays a distinct role on the restoration of injured cerebral cells, we believe that prompt and effective dehydration treatment would be beneficial to the recovery of cerebral damage. In addition, the application of intra-ocular pressure (IOP) measurement as an indirect criterion of cerebral oedema and hypovolaemia was introduced.
A randomized, double-blind study to determine whether speed of intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is associated with pain.
On two separate occasions, using two different speeds of injection (5 versus 60 seconds), 11 subjects received the same dose of PGE1 that they used at home. The presence, duration, and intensity of pain were recorded.
We found that fast penile injection of PGE1 was associated with a greater intensity of pain (P = 0.04).
Slow injection of PGE1 is less often associated with penile pain, the most common adverse effect of this treatment.
We evaluated the CNS complications in 118 adults with acute leukemia who received IV high-dose Ara-C therapy. Fourteen (12%) had cerebellar signs, encephalopathy, seizures, or leukoencephalopathy. Symptoms usually occurred within 24 hours after the last treatment. Patients receiving a cumulative dose in excess of 24 g/m2 had more severe or irreversible symptoms. After lower cumulative doses, symptoms often resolved even though treatment was continued. The incidence of CNS complications of high-dose Ara-C is acceptable and is potentially reversible if appropriate precautions are taken.
We report a case of a 32-year-old woman who developed paroxysmal episodes of right hemidystonia 2 days after taking fluoxetine. The attacks subsided 2 days after fluoxetine was withdrawn and did not recur afterwards. To our knowledge, this is the first report of paroxysmal dystonia induced by fluoxetine.
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a rare chronic cholestatic disorder of unknown origin that can now be treated effectively with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The clinical course of PBC is very variable, but a significant proportion of patients eventually die or undergo liver transplantation. In this single-center prospective long-term study, we analyzed the effect of UDCA therapy (10 mg/kg b.w./day) on conventional liver function tests and we also investigated whether serial quantitative liver function tests are useful in the clinical management of patients with PBC. Fifteen patients, most of them in an early disease stage, were followed up for either 4 (n = 7) or 5 (n = 8) years. In addition to regular conventional liver function tests, every 12 months quantitative liver function tests were performed. Thus we measured galactose elimination capacity, indocyanine green half-life and lidocaine half-life. Quantitative liver function tests were also performed once in healthy volunteers. Treatment with UDCA significantly improved conventional liver function tests, and this effect was maintained for several years (values in U/l before therapy and 4 years after therapy: AP = 1,346 +/- 317 vs. 516 +/- 93; gammaGT 378 +/- 80 vs. 144 +/- 30; LAP 122 +/- 10 vs. 71 +/- 9; AST 61 +/- 19 vs. 34 +/- 12; ALT 90 +/- 19 vs. 68 +/- 35; GLDH 14.3 +/- 1.9 vs. 8.2 +/- 1.9). Quantitative liver function tests were not significantly different between healthy volunteers and patients (GEC 6.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.0 +/- 0.3 mg/kg x min; ICG half-life 4.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.3 min; lidocaine half-life 75 +/- 8 vs. 79 +/- 6 min). In the patients, results of quantitative liver function tests (GEC, ICG and lidocaine half-lives) were not affected by UDCA therapy and remained constant over time. In the 1 patient who was transplanted, serial quantitative liver function tests did not indicate deteriorating liver function earlier than the patient's progressive symptoms or conventional liver function tests. Thus UDCA therapy markedly improved conventional liver function tests in patients with PBC, and this effect was maintained for at least 4-5 years. Possibly due to the fact that most of the patients were in an early disease stage, serial quantitative liver function tests provided little additional information that was relevant for planning therapy in the individual patient.
To ascertain whether the side effects of gossypol, hypokalemia and irreversibility, could be avoided on dose reduction.
Seventy-seven male volunteers were divided into 3 groups: control (22 cases), 10 mg gossypol (29 cases) and 12.5 mg (26 cases). Serum levels of testosterone, FSH and LH were measured by RIA and potassium by flame photometry. Sperm counts and motility were examined before and regularly after treatment for the evaluation of contraceptive efficacy.
The average sperm density and motility started to decrease significantly by the end of month 2 of medication and gradually reached the infertility levels (< 4 million/mL) in both treated groups. After that the 10 mg group was asked to take the same dose every other day for up to a total observation period of 16-18 months for the maintenance of infertility. Subjects in the 12.5 mg group did not take gossypol any more so as to observe the length of the loading dose required, but in a few, a maintenance dose of 12.5 mg every other day was instituted for a few more months. In both treated groups, none of the spouses was pregnant during the maintenance dose period. Serum levels of potassium, FSH, LH and testosterone were not significantly changed and not a single volunteer complained of myoasthenia. After cessation of drug administration, the semen data returned to pretreatment levels.
A regimen with 10 or 12.5 mg of gossypol as the daily loading dose and 35 or 43.75 mg as the weekly maintenance dose could induce infertility in male volunteers without developing hypokalemia or irreversibility.
Two patients with acute changes suggesting acute hepatitis after parenteral amiodarone administration are described. No other explanation for liver damage was found in these patients. Normalization of liver function in spite of continuation of drug infusion was observed.
The involvement of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, and calcium-dependent potassium channel (K(Ca)) activators on the negative modulation of phenylephrine-induced contractions was evaluated on the isolated aorta and caudal (CAU) artery obtained from rats treated with ouabain for 5 wk to induce hypertension. In ouabain-treated rats, the reactivity to phenylephrine was reduced in the endothelium-intact aorta but not the CAU segments. Endothelial modulation of phenylephrine contraction, as demonstrated by endothelium removal, NO synthase (NOS) inhibition with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and aminoguanidine, as well as K(Ca) inhibition with tetraethylammonium, was more pronounced in segments from ouabain-treated animals, and here greater effects were seen in the aorta than in CAU. An increased expression of endothelial NOS and neuronal NOS was seen in the aorta after ouabain treatment. In CAU, only endothelial NOS was detected and ouabain treatment did not alter its expression. These results suggest that ouabain-induced hypertension is accompanied by increased NO release derived from endothelial NOS and neuronal NOS and increased release of an endothelial hyperpolarizing factor that presumably opens K(Ca), all of which contribute to the increased negative modulation of the phenylephrine contraction.
The hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin is used widely to treat hypercholesterolemia and has been shown to have cell cycle-specific effects. In these studies, we have examined the effects of combining lovastatin and paclitaxel (Taxol), a microtubule-stabilizing agent, in the human leukemia K562 and HL-60 cell lines. Isobologram analysis of cytotoxicity assays revealed that there is a synergistic interaction between the two agents in both cell lines. Cell cycle analyses showed that lovastatin enhances paclitaxel-induced G2-M arrest in both cell lines. In addition, Annexin V apoptotic studies revealed that lovastatin enhances paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Lovastatin did not affect levels of [3H]paclitaxel in cells. Whereas lovastatin induced an accumulation of unmodified Ras and caused an up-regulation of both RhoB and Rap1A, paclitaxel was found to have no effect on the isoprenylated proteins. Studies of the centromere-associated protein mitosin revealed that treatment with lovastatin and paclitaxel resulted in increased mitosin levels and that lovastatin altered the association of mitosin with condensed chromosomes. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the cell cycle effects of lovastatin and support the development of a novel therapeutic strategy directed toward altering deleterious cell proliferation.
Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) released from capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves induce local neurogenic inflammation; somatostatin exerts systemic anti-inflammatory actions presumably via sst4/sst1 receptors. This study investigates the effects of a high affinity, sst4-selective, synthetic agonist, J-2156, on sensory neuropeptide release in vitro and inflammatory processes in vivo.
Electrically-induced SP, CGRP and somatostatin release from isolated rat tracheae was measured with radioimmunoassay. Mustard oil-induced neurogenic inflammation in rat hindpaw skin was determined by Evans blue leakage and in the mouse ear with micrometry. Dextran-, carrageenan- or bradykinin-induced non-neurogenic inflammation was examined with plethysmometry or Evans blue, respectively. Adjuvant-induced chronic arthritis was assessed by plethysmometry and histological scoring. Granulocyte accumulation was determined with myeloperoxidase assay and IL-1beta with ELISA.
J-2156 (10-2000 nM) diminished electrically-evoked neuropeptide release in a concentration-dependent manner. EC50 for the inhibition of substance P, CGRP and somatostatin release were 11.6 nM, 14.3 nM and 110.7 nM, respectively. J-2156 (1-100 microg kg(-1) i.p.) significantly, but not dose-dependently, inhibited neurogenic and non-neurogenic acute inflammatory processes and adjuvant-induced chronic oedema and arthritic changes. Endotoxin-evoked myeloperoxidase activity and IL-1beta production in the lung, but not IL-1beta- or zymosan-induced leukocyte accumulation in the skin were significantly diminished by J-2156.
J-2156 acting on sst4 receptors inhibits neuropeptide release, vascular components of acute inflammatory processes, endotoxin-induced granulocyte accumulation and IL-1beta synthesis in the lung and synovial and inflammatory cells in chronic arthritis. Therefore it might be a promising lead for the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs.
Existing animal models of visceral pain in the mouse are of limited practical usefulness since they are labor intensive or not visceral specific. Recently a rat model of cyclophosphamide (CP) cystitis was developed that requires only intraperitoneal injection and features inflammation confined to the bladder. We adapted this model for use in multiple mouse strains to investigate the genetic basis of variability in visceral nociception.
Outbred CD-1 mice and 12 inbred mouse strains were tested for behavioral changes induced by CP (0 to 300 mg/kg intraperitoneally).
We noted that despite the absence of postural changes or abdominal crises in CD-1 mice, CP produced dose dependent decreases in voluntary locomotor activity unaccompanied by ataxia measured on the rotarod test; referred hyperalgesia of the tail base region but not of the hind paw, which was inhibited in dose dependent fashion by morphine (0 to 20 mg/kg); and bladder inflammation corresponding to these behavioral indices. Furthermore, the extent of hypolocomotion was genotype dependent across 12 inbred strains.
The simple and automatable nature of CP cystitis using hypolocomotion as a dependent measure renders it an attractive model in which to investigate the genetic and physiological bases of visceral pain. Comparison of strain sensitivity to CP induced hypolocomotion with other nociceptive assays suggests that genes specific to visceral nociception may exist.
The effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on the hepatic circulation was investigated in an extreme situation during acute hemorrhagic hypotension. Eighteen mongrel dogs were divided into two groups of those who received intravenous injection of PGE1 (PGE1 group, n = 9) and those who received control solution (non-PGE1 group n = 9). After anesthetizing dogs with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen and 0.5% halothane, surgical procedure was carried out. Mean arterial pressure decreased to 50 mmHg by acute exsanguination, and this pressure was maintained by either saline (2.4 ml.kg-1 x h-1) or PGE1 (0.2 microgram.kg-1 x min-1) infused continuously for 2 hours. In dogs, PGE1 maintained the total hepatic blood flow with increased cardiac index and decreased splanchnic vascular resistance, in spite of the decreased mean arterial blood pressure during hemorrhagic hypotension. The result suggests that, in a hypotensive condition PGE1 may be useful in maintaining adequate hepatic circulation.
Serotonin uptake inhibitors are generally considered activating antidepressants. To assess rates and temporal patterns of activation and sedation as well as dose-effect relationships, adverse event data were evaluated from a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and fluoxetine 5, 20, and 40 mg/day in the treatment of major depressive disorder (N = 363) and two fixed-dose studies pooled together comparing placebo and fluoxetine 20, 40, and 60 mg/day in the treatment of major depressive disorder (N = 746). The adverse events nervousness, anxiety, agitation, and insomnia were considered indicative of activation; somnolence and asthenia were considered indicative of sedation. Activation and sedation were both statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) treatment-emergent phenomena, but dose-effect relationships differed. Activation rates were relatively stable between 5 and 40 mg/day, and then increased at 60 mg/day. Sedation rates increased linearly to 40 mg/day and then were comparable at 40 and 60 mg/day. Discontinuations for either phenomenon were uncommon. The temporal patterns of first occurrences and persistence of activation and sedation differed. First occurrences of activation peaked early and declined over time with all doses. First occurrences of sedation also peaked early with all doses, but there may have been greater variability in first occurrences of sedation over time with lower doses. Persistent occurrences of sedation may decline less over time than persistent occurrences of activation.
The authors describe 10 patients who developed panic attacks only after substantial cocaine use. The timing of the onset of symptoms, i.e., after 1-6 years of cocaine use, and the fact that only one patient had a first-degree relative with panic disorder were more suggestive of acquired than primary panic disorder. The patients' atypical symptoms and responses to medications may be explained in terms of limbic-neuronal hyperexcitability induced by cocaine through a kindling mechanism.
Rats were injected with a single dose of the monoamine-depleting agent reserpine (5 mg/kg s.c.) or its vehicle. Twenty-four hours later rats were injected with either the selective D1 agonist SKF 38393 (5 mg/kg i.p.), the selective D2 agonist quinpirole (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) or saline, and perfused 2 h later. Fos-like immunoreactivity was visualized using a polyclonal antibody to the Fos protein and standard ABC methods. Reserpine rendered striatal D1 and D2 receptors supersensitive as indicated by 10- to 12-fold increases in striatal and pallidal Fos immunoreactivity. The short latency of the development of both D1 and D2 supersensitivity limits the candidate causative mechanisms to those that occur within hours of the initiating stimulus.
Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a syndrome of severe pre- and postnatal growth retardation and typical dysmorphic features. Rare chromosomal aberrations have been reported in SRS; among these are two balanced translocations involving 17q24-q25. Recently, we described a patient with a paternally inherited heterozygous deletion of the chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 1 (CSH1) gene. The CSH1 gene is member of the growth hormone (GH) gene cluster on 17q, which consists of two growth hormone genes and three CSH genes. Genomic alterations in the GH cluster are well known, causing different phenotypes depending on the size of the deletion and the genes involved. By screening 63 SRS cases with marker D17S254, we have detected 2 further patients with a heterozygous deletion in the GH cluster. Quantitative analysis using restriction assays confirmed these findings. Additionally, in a cohort of 17 patients with isolated intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, we detected a further patient to be carrier of a CSH1 deletion. Screening of 141 unrelated controls revealed hemizygosity in one person for which data on growth were not available. We additionally analyzed our cohort of SRS patients for mutations in CSH1 and its 3' neighbour GH2. However, analyses failed to reveal any pathogenic mutation. While the central role of GH1 in human growth is well established, the physiological roles of CSH1 and other components of the cluster are unclear. The increased prevalence of hemizygosity of CSH1 in our population in comparison to controls indicates a role for CSH1 haploinsufficiency in the etiology of growth retardation. Investigation of CSH1 deletions in further SRS and growth retarded patients will enable us to establish under which circumstances haploinsufficiency of CSH1 is likely to result in clinical changes.
Twelve leukemic patients (19%) receiving amphotericin B and aminoglycosides had nephrotoxicity (creatinine value greater than 2.0 mg/dl). Patients with nephrotoxicity tended to be older than patients without nephrotoxicity; gender and total amphotericin B dose were not related to nephrotoxicity. Sodium administration has previously been shown to reverse amphotericin B nephrotoxicity. In this series, among patients receiving ticarcillin at greater than or equal to 18 gm/day (93.6 mEq of sodium per day) the incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly decreased (1/30, or 3.3%). A multivariate analysis showed that this protective effect of ticarcillin was not dependent on the fact that patients receiving ticarcillin were less likely to receive vancomycin. There were insufficient patients receiving sodium in the absence of ticarcillin to study the effect of sodium alone. However, our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that sodium can prevent renal dysfunction in this clinical situation.
We evaluated the effects of SMP-300 (N-(aminoiminomethyl)-11-chloro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-8-oxo-4H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-kl][1]benzazocine-2-carboxamide monomethanesulfonate monohydrate), a newly synthesized compound, on Na+/H+ exchange activity in rat cardiomyocytes and on other ion transporters, channels and receptors. We also investigated the protective effects of SMP-300 in isolated ischemic rat hearts and rat isoproterenol- or vasopressin-induced experimental angina models. SMP-300 concentration-dependently inhibited recovery from acidosis in rat myocytes, and its IC50 for Na+/H+ exchange was 6 nM. In comparison, its IC50s for Na+/Ca2+ exchange and for the Na+ channel were >1000 nM, and those for other channels or receptors tested were >10,000 nM. In rat isolated perfused hearts, SMP-300 (10(-8)-10(-7) M), administered only at preischemia and not during reperfusion, significantly improved the postischemic recovery of cardiac function. SMP-300 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) or 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (1 mg/kg, i.v.) prevented the isoproterenol-induced ST-segment depression in the ECG of anesthetized rats, in a dose-dependent manner. SMP-300 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (1 mg/kg, i.v.) also inhibited the vasopressin-induced ST-segment depression in the ECG of anesthetized rats. This is the first report presenting the protective effect of Na+/H+ exchange inhibitors on isoproterenol- or vasopressin-induced ECG changes in rats, providing the future perspective of SMP-300, a potent Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor, as an anti-anginal drug.
A 32-year-old woman with a bleeding tendency born of a consanguineous marriage, was found to have factor XIII subunit B deficiency. An abnormally low level of factor XIII activity was initially noticed and this finding led to further studies of the proband and her family. The notable features were: undetectable subunit B of factor XIII in the proband and her brother and reduced levels of subunit B, 34-52%, in her parents and children. The proband's brother had a markedly decreased level of subunit A protein. The level of factor XIII subunit A in platelets of the proband was normal. The half-life of subunit A determined from the disappearance curve of infused factor XIII subunit A concentrate was approximately 3 d and this is the shortest estimate of the half-life of factor XIII to date. From these results, it is suggested that subunit A is unstable in plasma deficient in subunit B and subunit B stabilizes the A protein. This is the first report of congenital deficiency of factor XIII subunit B and this disorder is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
