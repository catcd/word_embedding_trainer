Prenatal treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids is commonly used as a treatment for women at risk of preterm delivery. However, little is known about the life-long consequences of these treatments on the fetus. In the present study, we evaluated cognitive function as well as susceptibility of cholinergic neurons to (192)IgG-saporin immunolesion in adult rats after prenatal glucocorticoid treatment. Morris water maze results revealed a significant difference in learning and memory function in adult rats that were prenatally exposed to dexamethasone, and further cognitive deficits after (192)IgG-saporin exposure. Choline acetyl transferase activity was decreased in the cortex of dexamethasone-treated rats compared with controls. In addition, rats prenatally exposed to either dexa, or betamethasone revealed a dramatic decrease in choline acetyl transferase activity compared to control rats after (192)IgG-saporin lesion. We report behavioral and biochemical evidence for altered cognitive function and increased susceptibility of cholinergic neurons to (192)IgG-saporin in adult rats after prenatal glucocorticoid treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that prenatal treatment with dexamethasone could affect cognitive functions and render cholinergic neurons more vulnerable to challenges later in life.
The modifying effects of indomethacin (IM) on rat prostate carcinogenesis induced by 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) were investigated. F344 rats were given 50 mg/kg body weight of DMAB at 2-week intervals for 20 weeks and then received IM at a dose of 20 ppm in the drinking water for 37 weeks. Separate groups additionally received testosterone propionate (TP) in Silastic tubes throughout the experiment. DMAB alone induced carcinomas in situ in the ventral lobe and in combination with TP caused invasive carcinomas of the dorso-lateral and anterior lobes and seminal vesicles. No clear suppression by IM of development of in situ carcinomas or invasive carcinomas was observed. In a short-term satellite experiment, it was revealed that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in the dorso-lateral prostate and seminal vesicles, but not the ventral prostate, were significantly reduced by IM and that TP itself also suppressed PGE2 levels. The 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling index in the ventral prostate was significantly decreased by IM administration. These results indicate that while IM can efficiently suppress tissue PGE2 levels, it does not inhibit tumor development in the prostate or seminal vesicles of rats in the present model.
Peroxisome proliferators (PP), including clofibrate (CF), are non-genotoxic rodent carcinogens, and oxidative DNA damages are suggested as a causative event for carcinogenesis. Gene expression profiles differ between hepatic lesions induced by PP and genotoxic carcinogens. Our previous study revealed that expression of L-bifunctional enzyme (enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, BE) was repressed in preneoplastic lesions induced by PP, whereas it was enhanced in the surrounding tissues. In the present study, we immunohistochemically examined expression of the specific glutathione S-transferase (GST) form, GST-A4, which detoxifies 4-hydroxy-alkenal, the end-product of lipid peroxides, and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor for many genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and defending enzymes against oxidative stress, during rat hepatocarcinogenesis induced by CF and genotoxic carcinogens. GST-A4 and Nrf2 were not expressed in BE-negative foci at 8 weeks of CF administration, but were expressed in the foci at 60 weeks. GST-A4-positive foci appeared at later stages than BE-negative foci, but its localization was coincidental with that of the latter foci. The areas of GST-A4-positive foci were larger than those of BE-negative foci without GST-A4 expression. Most GST-A4-positive foci were also positive for Nrf2. In rat livers induced by genotoxic carcinogens, GST-P-negative foci as well as GST-P-positive foci were demonstrated. GST-A4 and Nrf2 were expressed in GST-P-negative foci, whereas they were not expressed in most GST-P-positive foci. Thus, GST-A4-positive foci developed in rat livers by CF and genotoxic carcinogen administration, indicating that the enzyme is a positive marker for hepatic foci induced by these different carcinogens.
Neural tube defects (NTD) are mainly of multifactorial origin. Maternal treatment with valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy induces NTD in susceptible fetuses. Elevated levels of homocysteine are observed in pregnancies with NTD. The mechanism by which homocysteine might cause NTD is unknown.
The aim of this study was to determine if homocystine would augment VPA-induced exencephaly in an experimental model.
Groups of mice were injected (IP) on gestational day 8 (GD) with a single dose of 75 mg/kg of L: -Homocystine (HC) or a proportionate volume of saline, followed by a single dose of 600 mg/kg of VPA or an equal volume of saline. In a second experiment, mice were treated with a daily dose of 75 mg/kg of HC or an equal volume of saline (IP) from GD 5 and continued through GD 10. These animals had a single exposure to 600 mg/kg of VPA or saline (IP) on GD 8. All animals were killed by cervical dislocation on GD 18. Plasma homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 were determined on GD 8 and GD 10 from single and multiple dose groups of mice, respectively, from additional experiments.
The VPA and HC+VPA induced significantly higher rates of embryonic resorption and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) than HC or saline alone. HC + VPA groups had significantly more numerous fetuses with severe IUGR than HC alone or VPA alone groups. Both single and multiple doses of HC augmented VPA-induced reduction in fetal body weight. Successive doses of HC did not augment the rate of IUGR more significantly than a single dose of HC. Incidence of exencephaly was significantly enhanced in the HC + VPA groups compared to that in the HC or VPA alone groups. HC alone was not teratogenic. Plasma homocysteine levels increased several fold both in HC and HC + VPA groups and the increase was not particularly more marked in multiple dose groups than in the single dose groups. VPA did not elevate homocysteine concentration. Both FA and vitamin B12 concentrations were reduced by VPA, HC and HC + VPA, but HC and VPA when combined did not produce an additive effect on vitamin levels.
These data indicate that HC and VPA interact in neurulation stage embryos, affect fundamental processes of closure of the neural tube and lead to enhanced incidence of NTD.
Neurotoxicity and mechanistic data were collected for six alpha-cyano pyrethroids (beta-cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenpropathrin and lambda-cyhalothrin) and up to six non-cyano containing pyrethroids (bifenthrin, S-bioallethrin [or allethrin], permethrin, pyrethrins, resmethrin [or its cis-isomer, cismethrin] and tefluthrin under standard conditions. Factor analysis and multivariate dissimilarity analysis were employed to evaluate four independent data sets comprised of (1) fifty-six behavioral and physiological parameters from an acute neurotoxicity functional observatory battery (FOB), (2) eight electrophysiological parameters from voltage clamp experiments conducted on the Na(v)1.8 sodium channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes, (3) indices of efficacy, potency and binding calculated for calcium ion influx across neuronal membranes, membrane depolarization and glutamate released from rat brain synaptosomes and (4) changes in chloride channel open state probability using a patch voltage clamp technique for membranes isolated from mouse neuroblastoma cells. The pyrethroids segregated into Type I (T--syndrome-tremors) and Type II (CS syndrome--choreoathetosis with salivation) groups based on FOB data. Of the alpha-cyano pyrethroids, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin and cypermethrin arrayed themselves strongly in a dose-dependent manner along two factors that characterize the CS syndrome. Esfenvalerate and fenpropathrin displayed weaker response profiles compared to the non-cyano pyrethroids. Visual clustering on multidimensional scaling (MDS) maps based upon sodium ion channel and calcium influx and glutamate release dissimilarities gave similar groupings. The non-cyano containing pyrethroids were arrayed in a dose-dependent manner along two different factors that characterize the T-syndrome. Bifenthrin was an outlier when MDS maps of the non-cyano pyrethroids were based on sodium ion channel characteristics and permethrin was an outlier when the MDS maps were based on calcium influx/glutamate release potency. Four of six alpha-cyano pyrethroids (lambda-cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and fenpropathrin) reduced open chloride channel probability. The R-isomers of lambda-l-cyhalothrin reduced open channel probability whereas the S-isomers, antagonized the action of the R-isomers. None of the non-cyano pyrethroids reduced open channel probability, except bioallethrin, which gave a weak response. Overall, based upon neurotoxicity data and the effect of pyrethroids on sodium, calcium and chloride ion channels, it is proposed that bioallethrin, cismethrin, tefluthrin, bifenthrin and permethrin belong to one common mechanism group and deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin and cypermethrin belong to a second. Fenpropathrin and esfenvalerate occupy an intermediate position between these two groups.
Phenytoin (PHT) is an antiepileptic drug known to have teratogenic effects. The aim of this study was to examine the ultrastructure of the left ventricle, the left atrium, and the aorta of 3-month-old offspring and 4-month-old mother animals after oral PHT (150 mg/kg/day) administration to Wistar/DV rats on days 7-18 of gestation. Electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed a heterogeneous population of cardiomyocytes with conventional architecture, and hypoxia/ischemia-like subcellular changes. Cardiomyocytes of offspring hearts were more vulnerable to PHT administration compared with the mother animals. Atrial cardiomyocytes of both mother animals and offspring were less affected by PHT than the ventricular ones. In the myocardium, both interstitial fibrosis and injury of capillaries were noted. Electron microscopy of the aorta revealed a higher resistance of maternal endothelial and smooth muscle cells to PHT compared with offspring cells. Nuclei of endothelial and smooth muscle cells showed pronounced mitotic activity with one and/or two hyperactive nucleoli, more frequently observed in offspring. PHT administration resulted in aortic arteriogenesis in both offspring and mother animals. Interestingly, bundles of myocardial fibers consisting of ischemia-like altered cardiomyocytes with own capillary network were noted in off-spring aortic adventitia. These results are indicative of harmful effects of PHT on rat myocardium and aorta.
The effects of a single oral dose of nisoldipine, 10 mg, were investigated in two groups of patients. Firstly, the effects of nisoldipine on exercise left ventricular function were assessed in 20 patients with chronic stable angina and coronary disease. Secondly, the effects of nisoldipine on the left ventricular response to cold pressor stimulation were examined in 12 patients with normal coronary arteries, who presented with typical ischaemic chest pain and abnormal exercise tests. All studies were performed using first pass radionuclide angiography and the new short half-life radiopharmaceutical, gold-195m. In patients with coronary disease, mean exercise time improved after nisoldipine (P less than 0.01). Both at the identical workload to that before treatment, and at a new peak workload, mean exercise left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved significantly after nisoldipine (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05 vs pretreatment levels, respectively). At the identical workload to that before treatment, 10 of 16 patients, who had initially developed angina, did not develop angina after nisoldipine, and 23 of 46 exercise-induced regional left ventricular abnormalities had normalized. In the patients with normal coronary arteries undergoing cold pressor stimulation, imaging was carried out at rest, and after 1 and 2.5 minutes of cold stimulation, before and one hour after oral nisoldipine. LVEF fell significantly during cold stimulation before nisoldipine administration, with 10 of the 12 patients showing an abnormal response. Nisoldipine did not lead to any attenuation of the heart rate and blood pressure response to cold, but mean LVEF did not fall at any cold pressor stage and only three patients showed an abnormal response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The long-term outcome of platinum-induced nephrotoxicity is unknown. This prospective single-centre longitudinal cohort study evaluated long-term changes following treatment in childhood.
63 children treated with platinum (27 cisplatin, 24 carboplatin and 12 both) were studied at the end of treatment (End), 1 year and 10 years later. No child received ifosfamide. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum calcium and magnesium (Mg) were measured, and total nephrotoxicity score (N(s)) was graded.
There was no significant overall change in renal function over time in any treatment group (cisplatin, carboplatin or combined). Apart from marginally reduced median GFR (84 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and Mg (0.68 mmol/l) at End of cisplatin, median GFR, Ca and Mg were normal at all times in each group. At 10 years, GFR was <60 ml/min/1.7 3m(2) in 11%, N(s) grade was severe in 15% and oral Mg supplements were required in 7% cisplatin patients. After cisplatin, older age at treatment was correlated with lower GFR at 10 years (p=0.005), and higher N(s) at End and 10 years (both p=0.02). After carboplatin treatment, older age was associated with lower GFR at all times, and with higher N(s) at End and 1 year (all p<0.03). Higher cisplatin dose rate (>40 mg/m(2)/day) was associated with higher N(s) at 1 year (p=0.02) and higher carboplatin dose with lower Mg at 1 year and with higher N(s) at 1 and 10 years (all p<0.008).
Platinum nephrotoxicity did not change significantly over 10 years. Its severity was correlated to older age at treatment, and at some time points to higher cisplatin dose rate and higher cumulative carboplatin dose.
Cardiotoxicity due to 5-fluorouracil involves rare and life-threatening cardiotoxic events occurring in less than 1% of the patients. We describe a case of coronary vasospasm due to parenteral 5-fluorouracil, which did not recur with oral capecitabine. We also give a brief review of the cardiotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil, its treatment and prevention.
Clinical, biochemical and nerve conduction studies were performed in 100 cases of tuberculosis taking isonicotinic acid hydrozide (isoniazid) for more than 12 weeks. Electro-physiological studies were carried out in a similar number of normal age and sex matched controls. In 16 percent of cases an abnormality was documented in the motor nerve conduction velocity, amplitude and terminal latency of the common peroneal, ulnar and median nerves; of these, only two patients had objective evidence of neuritis. The occurrence of isoniazid neuropathy was found to be more in the fourth decade of life (10 of 16), in those who had taken the drug for over six months (13 of 16), and in 'slow' inactivators (10 of 16).
Non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P) is one of the most common craniofacial malformations among newborn infants. It has been demonstrated that periconceptional folic acid supplementation may reduce the occurrence of offspring with clefts, particularly in the North China; however, the mechanism remains unknown. Our study of a thermolabile polymorphism (C677T) of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in 170 Chinese case-parent triads revealed a moderate association between this MTHFR polymorphism and nsCL/P in a population from North China, but not in a population from South China. Moreover, the study revealed that the heterozygous parents in the North were about twice as likely to transmit the high-risk T allele to affected cases, as that observed in the South (OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.08-4.65). Thus, the MTHFR polymorphism is a significant risk factor for nsCL/P in this Northern Chinese population. Our study suggested possible genetic heterogeneity in the development of nsCL/P among Northern and Southern populations in China.
The purpose of the present study was to determine whether copper histidine could inhibit copper transporter 1 (Ctr1)-mediated transport of oxaliplatin in vitro and thereby limit the accumulation of platinum and neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissue in vivo. In HEK293 cells overexpressing rat Ctr1, copper histidine was shown to be transported by Ctr1 and to inhibit their Ctr1-mediated uptake of oxaliplatin. Pilot in vivo dose-finding studies showed that copper histidine at doses up to 2 mg/kg, p.o., daily for 5 days/week could be added to maximum tolerated doses of oxaliplatin (1.85 mg/kg, i.p., twice weekly) for 8 week combination treatment studies in female Wistar rats. After treatment, rats showed significant changes in sensory neuron size profiles in DRG tissue induced by oxaliplatin that were not altered by its coadministration with copper histidine. The expression of copper transporters (Ctr1 and copper-transporting P-type ATPase 1 (Atp7a)) in DRG tissue appeared unchanged following treatment with oxaliplatin given alone or with copper histidine. Platinum and copper tissue levels were higher in DRG than in most other tissues, but were unaltered by the addition of copper histidine to oxaliplatin treatment. In conclusion, copper histidine inhibited cellular uptake of oxaliplatin mediated by Ctr1 in vitro without altering the accumulation of platinum or neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin in DRG tissue in vivo at doses tolerated in combination with oxaliplatin treatment.
Hip fracture is a common pathology in elderly patients. Intercurrent diseases, mainly cardiac and respiratory, often result in significant morbidity and mortality. Anesthesia for hip fracture can be provided by general or regional techniques. The combination of a lumbar plexus and posterior sciatic nerve block represents an alternative to neuraxial technique of anaesthesia such as spinal anesthesia (4, 6). We report a case of acute toxicity resulting in the injection of local anesthetics Ropivacaine and Mepivacaine in elderly patient. An elderly woman was scheduled for surgical repair of a fractured femur neck by dynamic hip screw synthesis. Anesthesia was realized by peripheral nerve bi-block (lumbar plexus and posterior sciatic block) (7). The patient experienced seizures and dysrhythmias twenty minutes after block completion and injection of the anesthetic solution [Ropivacaine 0.75%, administered for lumbar plexus block performed via the posterior approach (WINNIE) and Mepivacaine 1.5%, administered for posterior sciatic nerve block (LABAT)]. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successful. All signs of toxicity disappeared after injection of midazolam and atropine, intubation and 100% oxygen ventilation. We decided to proceed with surgery. The postoperative course was uncomplicated and made a full recovery.
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) may be one of the most common causes of dementia. It should be of particular interest to psychiatrists because hallucinations are common presenting symptoms and because patients with DLB may be particularly sensitive to neuroleptics with respect to developing extrapyramidal symptoms. The authors describe 2 patients with DLB who were intolerant of clozapine, showing not extrapyramidal side effects, but an increase in confusion and behavioral symptoms.
The purpose of this paper is to describe the effect of 5 years of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) on levodopa-induced complications, both in everyday life and during an acute challenge with levodopa. Thirty three patients were evaluated during an acute levodopa challenge before surgery and then 1 and 5 years afterwards (both off stim and on stim), using the UPDRS III scale and the CAPSIT-PD scales for dystonia and peak-dose dyskinesia. The UPDRS IV scale was used to assess motor complications in everyday life. The levodopa daily dose and DBS parameters were also recorded. Levodopa-induced complications in everyday life (UPDRS IV) and during an acute levodopa challenge had improved markedly after 1 year (both on and off stim) and still further at 5 years. Peak-dose dyskinesia decreased between the 1- and 5-year measurements. STN DBS decreases levodopa-induced motor complications over the long term. This phenomenon may be explained by (a) overall stabilization of the basal ganglia network and (b) striatal synaptic changes. Our results suggest that DBS leads to both qualitative and quantitative modulations in the corticostriatal loops.
Because of the prognostic importance of LV dysfunction following an AMI and the increasing use of electrical and/or mechanical interventions in patients with LV systolic dysfunction, this retrospective analysis of EPHESUS patients with LVEF <or=30% at baseline was conducted to determine the value of eplerenone in this setting.
In EPHESUS, 6,632 patients with LVEF <or=40% and clinical heart failure (HF) post-AMI who were receiving standard therapy were randomized to eplerenone 25 mg/day titrated to 50 mg/day or placebo for a mean follow-up of 16 months. Treatment with eplerenone in the subgroup of patients with LVEF <or=30% (N=2106) resulted in relative risk reductions of 21% versus placebo in both all-cause mortality (P=0.012) and cardiovascular (CV) mortality/CV hospitalization (P=0.001), and 23% for CV mortality (P=0.008). The relative risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) was reduced 33% (P=0.01) and HF mortality/HF hospitalization was reduced 25% (P=0.005) with eplerenone compared with placebo. Within 30 days of randomization, eplerenone resulted in relative risk reductions of 43% for all-cause mortality (P=0.002), 29% for CV mortality/CV hospitalization (P=0.006), and 58% for SCD (P=0.008).
Treatment with eplerenone plus standard therapy in patients with post-AMI HF and LVEF <or=30% provided significant incremental benefits in reducing both early and late mortality and morbidity.
We report about a 67-year old man, who was submitted to our clinic with acute coronary syndrome. The cardiac catheterization showed a proximal thrombus in the left anterior descending (LAD). The other coronary arteries did not have significant lesions. After percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent-implantation into the proximal LAD the patient remained clinically stable. Cardiac enzymes confirmed no myocardial necrosis. Three days after the acute coronary syndrome the patient developed a podagra, which was treated with colchicinum, diclofenac and local cooling. Five hours after initial therapy the patient developed severe symptoms of angina pectoris and electrocardiographical signs of an acute posterior and anterior myocardial infarction. Immediate coronary angiography demonstrated extended vasospasm of the right coronary artery. Intracoronary application of verapamil and nitroglycerin resolved the coronary spasm. The patient reported about a self-indicated application of diclofenac six hours before hospital admission. This case demonstrates that oral application of diclofenac can provoke coronary vasospasm.
The reduced risk of colorectal cancer associated with cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitors, such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, strongly suggests that chronic inflammation is a key mediator in the development of colorectal cancer. This complements recent molecular evidence demonstrating an association between a number of proinflammatory genetic polymorphisms and risk of colorectal cancer. We assessed polymorphisms in the IL-1, IL-10, TNF-A, and TGF-B genes in a population-based case-control study of colorectal cancer cases (n = 264) and frequency-matched controls (n = 408) in the Northeast of Scotland and analyzed their interaction with regular aspirin use. There was no evidence of a relation between any of the individual polymorphisms, or pairs of polymorphisms, and risk of colorectal cancer. There was a significant interaction between the IL-10-592 C/A polymorphism and aspirin use (Pinteraction = 0.03). Carriers of the variant IL-10-592 (A) allele, who produce less of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, had a statistically significant 50% reduced risk of colorectal cancer when taking regular aspirin (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.97), whereas risk was not reduced in carriers of the A allele who did not use aspirin, or among aspirin users with the CC genotype. It is possible that carriers of the mutant IL-10-592 allele are more likely to derive anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive benefits from aspirin in the presence of a lower production of their own endogenous anti-inflammatory interleukin-10. These results suggest that host genetics may play a role in predicting response to chemopreventive strategies. Confirmation of these findings in other populations is required.
Current developments in systemic therapies for melanoma are spectacular. Over the last 40 years no one drug or combination of drugs demonstrated any impact on survival in metastatic melanoma. In contrast, in 2011 a number of new drugs will be approved. In 2011 immunomodulation with ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the ligand CTLA-4, has been approved for patients with advanced melanoma in first- and second-line treatment by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in second-line treatment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Also in 2011, a significant survival benefit of the combination of ipilimumab with dacarbazine compared with dacarbazine alone for first-line treatment was reported. Other monoclonal antibodies targeting T-cell ligands, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1), also show promise. Various inhibitors of v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF) yield high response rates in patients harbouring the BRAF-V600E mutation. A significant impact on both progression-free and overall survival was demonstrated for vemurafenib compared with dacarbazine in a phase-III trial. Approval is expected in 2011. Both drugs had only modest effects of 2-3 months on median survival, so combination therapies must be explored. BRAF inhibitors in combination with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors show great potential. Moreover, combinations of immunomodulators and pathway inhibitors are expected to be very active, and phase-III trials are planned. Pegylated interferon-α2b was approved in 2011 on the basis of the results of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18991 phase-III trial demonstrating a sustained impact on relapse-free survival in patients with lymph-node-positive melanoma. The efficacy of adjuvant therapy with ipilimumab is assessed in the now fully accrued EORTC18071 trial. Adjuvant trials with BRAF and MEK inhibitors are in the planning phase. Never was there a more exciting period in the world of melanoma treatment.
Primiparous female Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously with single daily doses of 40 mg of cocaine hydrochloride/kg from day 7 to 19 of gestation, from day 7 of gestation to day 15 postpartum or from parturation to day 15 postpartum. At birth, some of the offspring were fostered to control mothers to limit the effect of cocaine to the prenatal period and some were left with their mothers with the aim of studying prenatal plus postnatal exposure to cocaine. Prenatal and/or postnatal cocaine exposure did not affect the content of somatostatin (SS)-like immunoreactivity (SLI) in the striatum of the offspring as compared with the control groups on day 15 in all experimental groups. Prenatal and prenatal-plus-postnatal exposure to cocaine increased the total number of binding sites for 125I-Tyr11-SS in the rat striatum at 15 days of age. Prenatal exposure to cocaine also decreased the apparent affinity of the receptors. Postnatal exposure to cocaine alone had no such post-treatment effect on 125I-Tyr11-SS binding. These results suggest that the development of SS receptors in the rat striatum can be altered by prenatal exposure to cocaine.
The current study investigated the efficacy and safety of olmesartan medoxomil in children with hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure measured at or above the 95th percentile (90th percentile for patients with diabetes, glomerular kidney disease, or family history of hypertension) for age, gender, and height while off any antihypertensive medication. The active treatment phase was conducted in 2 periods, with 2 cohorts in each period (cohort A, 62% white; cohort B, 100% Black). In period 1, patients stratified by weight received low-dose (2.5 or 5 mg) or high-dose (20 or 40 mg) olmesartan medoxomil daily for 3 weeks. In period 2, patients maintained their olmesartan medoxomil dose or initiated placebo washout for an additional 2 weeks. Period 1 efficacy results showed a dose-dependent, statistically significant reduction in seated trough systolic and diastolic blood pressure for both cohorts, with mean blood pressure reductions numerically smaller in cohort B than in cohort A. The olmesartan medoxomil dose response remained statistically significant when adjusted for body weight. In period 2, blood pressure control decreased in those patients switching to placebo, whereas patients continuing to receive olmesartan medoxomil therapy maintained consistent blood pressure reduction. Adverse events were generally mild and unrelated to study medication. Olmesartan medoxomil was safe and efficacious in children with hypertension, resulting in significant blood pressure reductions.
Two organotin pesticides, triphenyltin acetate (TPTA) and triphenyltin hydroxide (TPTH), were evaluated for their ability to induce micronuclei (MN) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in vitro using cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in vivo BALB/c mouse erythrocytes. Both pesticides induced a dose-dependent increase but only TPTH induced a significant increase in MN at the highest dose (150 ng/ml) tested in CHO cells. With adding S9 microsomal fractions, both pesticides induced a meaningful MN induction at 150 ng/ml and a dose-dependent significant increase in SCE. In vivo MN induction in erythrocytes was conducted by treating BALB/c mice orally or intraperitoneally with these pesticides either in a single or triple treatments. Oral gavage (p.o.) of TPTA resulted in a dose-related significant increase of MN induction in peripheral blood and of TPTH induced a significant increase in micronucleated reticulocyte (MNRETs) only in a single treatment. Intraperitoneal administration of TPTA or TPTH, however, resulted in meaningless random increases in MN though these increases might be attributable to toxic effects. The MNRETs levels in the treatment with both pesticides were independent to the sampling time. This study demonstrated that TPTA and TPTH was potential chromosome mutagens.
Opiates are the most effective drugs for pain relief. However, the repeated use of opiates induces tolerance to their analgesic effects. It has been shown that this morphine-induced tolerance is associated with apoptosis in the central nervous system. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of riluzole, an anti-glutamatergic drug, on morphine-induced apoptosis in the lumbar region of the rat spinal cord. Animals were given daily injections of morphine and vehicle, morphine and riluzole, or riluzole alone. Nociception was assessed using a hot plate apparatus, and apoptosis was assessed using the in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method. The levels of anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and HSP 70 and the pro-apoptotic agent caspase-3 were evaluated using immunoblotting. The glutamate concentration in the lumbar spinal cord was measured with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results indicate that the i.c.v. administration of riluzole attenuated morphine tolerance and reduced the number of TUNEL positive cells. Immunoblotting revealed that the levels of the selected anti-apoptotic agents were greater in the treatment groups compared to the controls. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the administration of riluzole can attenuate the morphine-induced elevation of glutamate in the lumbar spinal cord. In conclusion, i.c.v. administration of riluzole attenuated morphine-induced tolerance to analgesia and apoptosis in addition to preventing the morphine-induced increase of glutamate in the lumbar spinal cord of rats.
In a genome-wide association study of patients being treated for chronic hepatitis C, 2 functional variants in ITPA that cause inosine triphosphatase (ITPase) deficiency were shown to protect against ribavirin (RBV)-induced hemolytic anemia during early stages of treatment. We aimed to replicate this finding in an independent cohort from the Study of Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis C and to investigate the effects of these variants beyond week 4.
Genetic material was available from 318 patients. The ITPA variants, rs1127354 (exon 2, P32T) and rs7270101 (intron 2, splice altering), were genotyped and tested for association with hemoglobin (Hb) reduction at week 4. An ITPase deficiency variable was defined that combined both ITPA variants according to documented effect on ITPase activity. We investigated the impact of ITPA variants on Hb levels over the course of therapy and on the need for RBV dose reduction.
The final analysis included 304 patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (167 white patients and 137 black patients). The polymorphisms rs1127354 and rs7270101 were associated with Hb reduction at week 4 (P = 3.1 × 10(-13) and 1.3 × 10(-3), respectively). The minor alleles of each variant protected against Hb reduction. Combining the variants into the ITPase deficiency variable strengthened the association (P = 2.4 × 10(-18)). The ITPase deficiency variable was associated with lower rates of anemia over the entire treatment period (48 weeks), as well as a lower rate of anemia-related RBV dose reduction (hazard ratio, 0.52; P = .0037). No association with sustained virological response was observed.
Two polymorphisms that cause ITPase deficiency are strongly associated with protection from RBV-induced hemolytic anemia and decrease the need for RBV dose reduction.
Oral delivery of previously disclosed purine and benzimidazole fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) inhibitors via prodrugs failed, which was likely due to their high molecular weight (>600). Therefore, a smaller scaffold was desired, and a series of phosphonic acid-containing thiazoles, which exhibited high potency against human liver FBPase (IC(50) of 10-30 nM) and high selectivity relative to other 5'-adenosinemonophosphate (AMP)-binding enzymes, were discovered using a structure-guided drug design approach. The initial lead compound (30j) produced profound glucose lowering in rodent models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after parenteral administration. Various phosphonate prodrugs were explored without success, until a novel phosphonic diamide prodrug approach was implemented, which delivered compound 30j with good oral bioavailability (OBAV) (22-47%). Extensive lead optimization of both the thiazole FBPase inhibitors and their prodrugs culminated in the discovery of compound 35n (MB06322) as the first oral FBPase inhibitor advancing to human clinical trials as a potential treatment for T2DM.
